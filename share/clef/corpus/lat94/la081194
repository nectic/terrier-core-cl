 BIG LITTLE MASCOT: Friends of the Channel Islands, a nonprofit group, have a 
case of the warm fuzzies over the recent discovery of a rare pygmy mammoth 
fossil on Santa Rosa Island. They hope the skeletal remains will be just the 
ticket to lure visitors to the underappreciated islands (B1) . . . Already, 
T-shirts and lapel pins featuring the little critter's likeness are being 
worked up. Proceeds will help pay for a mold of the fossil for display at the 
Channel Island Visitors Center. . . . "It's amazing the number of people born 
and raised here who have never been to the islands," said group president 
Felice Ginsberg. 
</P>
<P>
 ISLAND TOUR: Santa Rosa Island's mammoth fossil has already attracted one 
important visitor: Renowned British physicist Stephen Hawking flew to the 
island last weekend. . . . Steep terrain prevented Hawking, who uses a 
wheelchair, from getting close to the excavation site. But Channel Islands 
Aviation pilot Bud Jourden said the best-selling author took a whirlwind tour 
of other wonders on the island.

 LOOKING GOOD: They're big, hairy, hungry -- and they may be lumbering soon to 
a rural Ventura County neighborhood near you. California black bears, fat from 
feeding on avocados, are reproducing big-time. (Ventura County Life, Page 8). . 
. . Besides plumping up the bears, the avocados provide a cosmetic side 
benefit: glossy fur. "There are some exceptionally large bears up there with 
nice shiny coats," said state Fish and Game biologist Morgan Boucke.

 OTB TV: Who says too much TV is a bad thing? Folks at Ventura County's new 
off-track betting facility might beg to differ. . . . Closed-circuit 
televisions will be everywhere at the $5.4-million Watch & Wager center -- the 
better to enable fans to watch the races when the facility opens next January. 
"That's our primary product," Seaside Park General Manager Michael Paluszak 
said. With more than 200 TVs showing races and statistics, fans should see 
plenty of action.

"very likely" buy another.

by an English cabinet-maker named Joseph Bramah -- not Thomas Crapper, as 
toilet folklore holds.

CLEAN AIR AND A STRONG ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one in Southern California wants dirty air. Not Mayor Richard Riordan, not 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, not the many residents and 
businesses that have left the region for cleaner, safer areas or more promising 
economic climes, and certainly not those who have decided to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 But dirty air is what we have, by far the worst in the nation in fact. And it 
has been far too dirty for decades. Much progress has been made, and that 
progress must continue; but so, too, must the economic recovery from this 
region's devastating recession. Needlessly expensive or severe rules to improve 
air quality could threaten that recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the federal Clean Air Act, Congress has required Southern California 
and other areas with pollution problems to meet strict air quality goals. 
Meeting those goals would mean much cleaner air over the basin. Toward that 
end, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as directed by Congress, has 
drafted a plan to clean up Southern California's air. So have the Air Quality 
Management District and the City of Los Angeles. These draft plans, and rules 
promulgated by the state Air Resources Board, differ in their projections, 
models, implications and details. But each moves the basin toward the federal 
air goals. There are no good guys and bad guys here, only honest differences in 
approach. There are also differences in responsibility. The EPA, cast by 
Congress in the role of policeman, has the ultimate obligation to make sure 
Congress' goals are met. If the localities fail to produce plans or if their 
plans don't achieve federal goals, then the EPA must step in with its tougher, 
less flexible rules to reduce air emissions. No one, not even the EPA, wants 
that to happen.  
</P>
<P>
 But if the feds have the ultimate responsibility for cleaner air in the L.A. 
Basin, those of us who live and work here shoulder the biggest financial burden 
of meeting those clean air requirements. That's why Mayor Riordan is concerned 
about finding the best -- the least onerous and most effective -- way of doing 
so. He has asked the AQMD to delay for 30 days its vote, now scheduled for 
Friday, on whether to approve its air plan for the region. Riordan wants the 
delay to ensure a comprehensive review of the plan by scientists, lawyers and 
representatives of all the agencies responsible for cleaning Los Angeles' air. 
He wants to be assured that the scientific assumptions on which air rules in 
the plan will be based are sound, to discuss differences in approach and 
outcome, to fully explore the fiscal and legal impacts of these plans and, to 
the greatest extent possible, to find ways to mitigate those impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the mayor slow off the mark in recognizing his obligation to work with 
federal, state and local agencies on this critical issue? Oh, probably. Should 
the district nonetheless give him a bit more time to agree on the best way to 
proceed? Absolutely. Too much is at stake not to do so.

CALIFORNIA -- DON'T COUNT US OUT!; CENSUS RECOUNT COULD HELP THE STATE 
SIGNIFICANTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court has ruled that the 1990 census somehow lost count of 
about 5 million Americans, primarily minority members who live in Los Angeles, 
New York and other big cities. The court held that the Bush Administration had 
failed to justify the refusal of then-Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher to 
accept the Census Bureau's correction of an undercount. That refusal deprived 
millions of citizens of their fundamental right to equal representation in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration should correct this injustice by accepting the 
ruling -- forgoing an appeal -- and adjusting the 1990 census count upward 
before more harm is done. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown should certify the revised count that was 
rejected by Mosbacher and send the new population statistics to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Reapportionment is also part of the remedy. California and Arizona each are 
entitled to an additional seat in the House. Justice requires swift action, 
without waiting for resolution of another round of legal appeals and 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 The losers, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, aren't expected to give up a 
congressional seat easily. Sen. Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) already has written to 
U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to indicate that his state will appeal the ruling. 
The legal battles could take years. 
</P>
<P>
 The putative winners, California and Arizona, have every right to be 
impatient. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has written Reno and President 
Clinton to request action "as soon as legally possible." She's right, and she's 
not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a bipartisan fight for fairness. Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, who 
has had to manage in an era of red ink in Sacramento, has lobbied hard for a 
correction of the undercount and for California's fair share of federal 
allocations. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercount, in addition to denying California a congressional seat, has 
cost it hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds, which are allocated 
in part on the basis of population figures. The state and the City of Los 
Angeles lost funds designated for highway construction and safety, coastal zone 
management, land and water conservation, libraries, special housing and 
nutrition programs for the elderly, juvenile delinquency prevention and 
criminal justice grants, energy conservation and emergency homeless shelters -- 
all because of the census undercount.  
</P>
<P>
 Why didn't the Bush Administration correct the undercount? Did politics 
contaminate the census results? Did Mosbacher refuse to accept the results of 
the post-enumeration survey because minority members who live in big cities 
tend to be Democrats? If so, that's shameful. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating problems with the federal census, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. 
Hahn -- represented superbly by his deputy, Jessica Heinz -- in 1988 initiated 
the legal effort to produce an accurate census. Heinz, eventually joined by 
lawyers from other cities and states and the NAACP, has prevailed for now and 
promises to fight on until the undercount is corrected, the federal funding is 
changed and California gains another member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans must not lose faith in the principle of equal representation, 
especially in a time that so encourages cynicism. Equal rights are guaranteed 
by the U.S. Constitution. But citizens don't count unless they are actually 
counted. The 1990 census must be corrected as soon as possible. Undercount

 So (Republican Senate candidate) Mike Huffington wants to cut off welfare

would take us back to the 16th Century and rob poor people of whatever dignity 
they have.

as registering for employment and accepting training courses. The system is not

HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hurray for Benjamin Zycher, a lonely voice telling it like it is again in his 
column "Misguided Policies -- Then the Earthquake," Commentary, July 27. 
</P>
<P>
 He is absolutely correct, tying earthquake coverage to homeowners insurance 
works only as long as homeowners is a profitable line of business and the 
earthquakes are small. However, there is much more to the availability problem 
in the homeowners line of business in California than just the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The California insurance industry has not made a profit in the homeowners line 
since 1989. In fact, it has lost $2.4 billion for the period 1990 through 1993 
after including investment income on funds attributable to insurance 
transactions. Also, earthquakes have been larger and more frequent than 
anticipated in 1984 (the year the mandatory earthquake law became effective) 
when most of the rates were set. Even so, companies which see an opportunity to 
make a reasonable profit in the future do not abandon market share because of a 
past loss. It is when regulators take away this opportunity that they leave the 
market.  
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic that the insurance commissioner argued before the California 
Supreme Court on June 7 that his rate regulations shouldn't be found 
confiscatory under any circumstances because if companies don't like them they 
are free to leave the state, and then less than three weeks later appeals to 
the governor and the Legislature to pass a law preventing them from doing so. A 
sort of economic Berlin Wall. It did not work there and it shouldn't be tried 
here.  
</P>
<P>
 In the long run only cost-based rating and the free-enterprise system of 
competition work best for the consumer, business and the California economy as 
a whole.

 * Zycher's column comes across as hardly an objective analysis of the 
insurance "mess" we have in California. He writes of Prop. 103, passed in 1988 
by California voters, as part of the "perverse politicization" of the 
California insurance market. The fact is, Mr. Zycher, Prop. 103 has not yet 
been implemented, thanks to the slick insurance company lawyers and the 
fortuitous presence of Republican politicians (Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and Gov. 
Pete Wilson's appointees) who play footsie with their well-endowed, 
well-positioned insurance company constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Zycher, the insurance companies' champion, builds a splendid case for 
government-run homeowners insurance in California, insurance that would cover 
contingencies from natural catastrophes and disastrous liabilities of all 
kinds, including earthquakes. If giant, non-risk-taking and profit-driven 
insurance companies run for cover and refuse to write this kind of protective 
coverage for California citizens, it's obvious only one course of action 
remains. Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, go for it.

 * Like so many other people, I too was dismayed at the lack of publicity given 
to the 25th anniversary of Apollo II's landing on the moon.  
</P>
<P>
 I was even more surprised at the lack of attention given to the students who 
were so involved with all the "space" festivities that week.The Times did not 
even realize that my school, Whitney High School of Cerritos, took first place 
in the National Space Design competition. Fifteen students worked for months to 
complete a design for a proposed 15,000-person orbiting space colony. After 
making it to the final four, we again, in two days, had to prepare a proposal 
for a 12,000-person moon colony, and present it in front of various 
international engineers and astronauts. And we won first place. 
</P>
<P>
 What we need, perhaps, is more publicity about these accomplishments by young 
students, instead of complaining about what's "not working" in this country.  
</P>
<P>
 It is nice to know that students, along with modest celebrities like Neil 
Armstrong, Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin and Michael Collins still care about our 
nation's future in man's frontier (July 21). As I said to President Clinton 
during that Apollo reception, "You know, sir, we do plan to keep the dream

 * Re James A. Baker's column, "Clinton's Search for a Foreign Economic 
Policy," Opinion, July 31: 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to James Baker, who wisely advocates sustained U.S. support for 
reform forces within Japan, President Clinton seems highly confused and his 
economic diplomacy with Japan has been, if anything, counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 When the reform-minded Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was in office, he 
pushed hard for domestic political reform, more open trade and economic 
deregulation, all of which directly or indirectly benefit the United 
States.However, President Clinton, caught up with domestic politics, chose to 
harass and insult Hosokawa and his supporters. Understandably, such hard-line 
posturing and name-calling ended up undermining the fragile coalition of 
Hosokawa and the entire reform movement in Japan. Clinton's own credibility was 
also seriously eroded, not only in Japan but throughout Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet since the protectionist, anti-reform Socialists took over the Japanese 
government a month ago, Clinton has become conciliatory and even supportive of 
this Socialist-led government of Japan. It doesn't make any sense, does it?

</P>
<P>
 Americans should stop expecting our government to end the Japanese trade 
deficit. The government's efforts have been ineffective anyway. But, Americans 
themselves have the power to end the Japanese trade deficit. Just stop buying 
their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States should trade freely with Japan and the rest of the world, 
but we shouldn't allow any country to sucker us into a $60-billion trade 
deficit.

SCHOOL COMPARISONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Good Schools, Bargain Prices" (Aug. 2) once again misses the point and 
misleads taxpayers and employers. Historically, schools existing in areas with 
the most favorable demographics have less costly expenses and, predictably, 
better results. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools where parents insist that their children complete homework assignments 
and read required material will see higher grades. Schools where there are 
fewer non-English-speaking students and students with special needs will have 
fewer government mandates and more funds for each classroom. Schools that are 
in higher socioeconomic areas will have students whose grades and test scores 
reflect such environmental and parental advantages.  
</P>
<P>
 The Times would better serve its readers by comparing those school districts 
that share similar demographics and identifying those that are experiencing 
academic success. When closely examined, odds are that these districts will 
have parents not only demanding higher academic effort from their children, but 
also providing more than just "lip service" to their expectations.

PERSPECTIVE ON BASEBALL; A RELIGION THAT GOES TO OUR ROOTS; THE GAME IS SO MUCH 
MORE THAN THE GREED AND ARROGANCE OF ITS MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYERS AND OWNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE GRELLA, George Grella is a professor of English and film studies at 
the University of Rochester. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I believe in the church of baseball," says Annie Savoy in "Bull Durham," one 
of the best films on the subject, and most fans share her belief. With a strike 
imminent, we must conclude that the money changers have taken over the temple; 
because of its wealth, organization and popularity, the collective entity 
officially known as Major League Baseball deludes itself that it actually 
represents or even somehow possesses the game. To presume that the sport really 
resides in the major leagues, however, is rather like some devout worshiper 
imagining that God dwells only in the great cathedrals of his faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Since all ball games seem to have originated in ancient religious practices, 
the analogy is entirely appropriate; certainly all true fans know that baseball 
retains its sense of the mystical and marvelous. Once the ritual stick-and-ball 
contests filtered down from the priestly classes to the common folk and spread 
across Europe, the game itself split into innumerable competing sects, many of 
which survive in one form or another in the present day -- hockey, polo, 
cricket and golf, for example, obviously share some common elements with 
baseball. Its long and complicated history suggests that baseball can never 
belong to a special group, a single wealthy and privileged class, or in 
contemporary America, to a bunch of whiny, greedy owners and players. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, no matter how high the salaries and how enormous the profits, 
baseball cannot soil itself with economics; all that money, which constitutes 
the central issue between the two sides in the dispute, changes hands outside 
the boundaries of the game. In its purest sense no game can involve money. The 
contest takes place within certain limits that mark it as a game, a field that 
become a free and sacred space. The only possible exchange within that arena is 
an essentially mystical transaction, the process of victory and defeat -- a 
team wins or loses an intangible object, a ballgame, a precious something of no 
apparent value. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most important reasons for baseball's special prominence in 
American culture derive from its assertion of freedom. Limited only by two 
diverging lines that never reach an end, it opens rather than encloses space; 
played without a clock, it suspends the progress of time. Promising an infinity 
of space and an eternity of time, it expresses fully the grandest, most 
liberating dreams of the national spirit, which must not be enchained by the 
greed and arrogance of the professional baseball people. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the beliefs of those who run the major leagues, the game need not 
be conducted in great stadiums or manicured fields, before thousands of 
spectators and millions of television viewers. Like the nice ordinary 
neighborhood kid who struck it rich and moved to a snooty part of town, Major 
League Baseball has forgotten where it came from.  
</P>
<P>
 Its origins lie not only in the distant past of ancient civilizations, but in 
the living history of American culture, where it evolved from a children's game 
to an artistic endeavor uniquely suited to the nation's spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 True baseball, after all, simply doesn't belong to the plutocrats who think 
that owning a profitable franchise and extorting money from compliant 
municipalities qualifies them to speak for the sport. It belongs to the 
American people, who play it in its purest form, far beyond the concrete walls 
of someone's ill-gotten ballpark, in all sorts of odd but appropriate places -- 
schoolyards, vacant lots, concrete playgrounds, perhaps even on some farm field 
stretching to the distant horizon.  
</P>
<P>
 Uninhibited by the bureaucratic nonsense of officialdom, that game needs no 
leagues or umpires or uniforms, but simply a bat and ball and maybe a glove; 
often without the full complement of players, often with one field entirely 
forbidden, or some confusion about the exact distance between bases, it is 
amateur, unorthodox, unorganized baseball, the very best version of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the game that fans should play and watch and believe in. That game will 
continue as long as the nation exists, the people will continue to love it and 
the Republic will remain intact. No strike can destroy the purity, joy and 
significance of the essential game as practiced in the church of baseball.

By MARLYS ROBERTSON, president of the League of Women Voters of California, 
comments on the need for universal health coverage: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's senators must meet the challenge and deny the push from 
small-employer groups to put off universal coverage until the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein has said that insurance reform and voluntary purchasing 
cooperatives will be the avenue to universal coverage by the year 2000.In fact, 
California enacted legislation for a voluntary Health Insurance Purchasing 
Cooperative in July, 1993. By some estimates, the HIPC might reduce the number 
of uninsured by 100,000, or about 2% of the 6 million uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the U.S. Senate passes a reform requiring that no one be excluded 
because of a pre-existing condition, that would still leave 5.5 million 
Californians uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 The most cost-effective and efficient method of achieving universal coverage 
is through an employer mandate. Such a mandate builds on the current system and 
requires fair participation by all employers. 
</P>
<P>
 The League urges Feinstein to be the stateswoman she is and not just another 
politician, and vote to achieve comprehensive reform this year.

SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON COMPTON; RACE RELATIONS: ONE YOUTH'S 
POLICE-ABUSE COMPLAINT IS BEING MISUSED TO DISTORT A HISTORY OF BLACK-LATINO 
TOLERANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEGRAND H. CLEGG II, Legrand H. Clegg II is the Compton city attorney. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Compton has been the center of nationwide attention ever since a 
videotape revealed what appears to be hostile contact between an African 
American Compton police officer and a 17-year-old Latino on July 29. Although 
investigations into the incident have just begun, some Latino activists have 
already invoked the memory of the Rodney King case and are blaming the affair 
on black racism in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnulfo Alatorre Jr., president of the Latino Chamber of Commerce, made the 
astonishing allegation that "Latinos are treated worse by city officials than 
the blacks were treated by whites in South Africa." Others complain that no 
Latinos are employed in City Hall. Still others accuse black elected officials 
of indifference toward Latino complaints in the July 29 incident. None of this 
is true. 
</P>
<P>
 In Compton, a complex relationship has evolved between Latinos and African 
Americans over the past 50 years. Before World War II, many Latinos lived in 
Compton, but blacks were not welcome. After the war, Compton was one of the few 
suburbs where African Americans were allowed to buy homes. They moved to 
Compton in large numbers until the black population reached its peak of 73% in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 After the outbreak of civil unrest in neighboring Watts in 1965, white people 
began to leave Compton, and the Latino middle class appears to have joined the 
flight. In the early 1980s, a new, less affluent class of Latinos began moving 
into the city, and today it constitutes about half of Compton's population. 
</P>
<P>
 The black reception of this new group has been anything but racist. African 
Americans have never burned crosses on the lawns of Latinos. Black children 
have not withdrawn from schools integrated by Latinos. Nor has Compton 
witnessed a black flight in response to the changing demographics. Local 
African-American merchants frequently hire Latinos, and large numbers of black 
people patronize Latino businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 This is not to suggest that Latinos have no legitimate grievances in Compton. 
There is, for example, a dearth of Latino representation on some levels of 
local government. Is this, however, due to racist policies? The evidence 
suggests not. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two politically active groups in Compton. The most prominent is the 
African American middle class, which is largely composed of senior citizens who 
have resided in the city for 30 years or more. The second is a tiny but vocal 
body of Latino leaders who own local businesses but generally do not reside in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, because residency is a requirement for seeking public office, few 
Latino leaders have done so in Compton. Moreover, the Latino population does 
not, in large measure, participate in political events, and generally votes in 
minuscule numbers. Nevertheless, in a city where the voting population is 80% 
black, two officials who have had the longest terms in public office have been 
white and Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans began to integrate City Hall in the late 1960s and early 
'70s. Since black people suffer most from employment discrimination, many are 
reluctant to change jobs once they have found security. Therefore, a number of 
African Americans, who were hired by the city when blacks were a majority, have 
remained in its employ for 15 or 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two decades, however, African Americans certainly have not been 
the only people employed by the city. Among others, numerous Latinos have been 
hired, and many of them are paid bonuses for their bilingual skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as it is unfair to accuse black officials of historical racism toward 
Latinos in Compton, it is equally wrong to charge them with indifference in the 
current crisis. Upon receiving a complaint from the arrested youth, the Compton 
Police Department began an internal investigation. After viewing the videotape, 
the mayor called a press conference, not only to apprise the public of the 
department inquiry but also to state that the officer involved had been placed 
on paid leave, and to reiterate that the district attorney had been invited to 
conduct an independent investigation to ensure impartiality. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor has also held numerous dialogues with Latino leaders since this 
controversy began. Black clergymen and leaders of the local NAACP have pledged 
to work with Latino groups and city officials to see that the events 
surrounding the July 29 incident are fully investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, black fury over the Rodney King beating followed years of brutality 
by white police officers against African Americans in the South and in urban 
ghettos. To compare the King incident with the present case, thereby accusing 
the officer of racism simply because he is black and the youth Latino, is 
highly inflammatory and a gross exaggeration.

THEATER REVIEW; 'SOUND' IS BACK WITH ALL ITS TRAPPINGS; MARIE OSMOND'S 
WHOLESOME MARIA GIVES STRENGTH TO 'MUSIC' AT PANTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How do you solve a problem like "The Sound of Music"? One way is to cast Marie 
Osmond, perhaps the only star in America who could believe unequivocally in the 
impeccable sentiments of the singing nun, Maria. As Oscar Hammerstein II stated 
many times, an artist can freshen the most tired cliche if he approaches it 
guilelessly. That talent allowed Hammerstein to write a lyric like "Oh, what a 
beautiful morning/Oh, what a beautiful day," celebrating an experience so 
ordinary it remains invisible to most people. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hammerstein penned that song for "Oklahoma!," his first musical with 
Richard Rodgers, 16 years before "Raindrops on roses/And whiskers on kittens" 
-- a lyric to choke on, and food for countless parodies. Unlike "Oklahoma!" or 
"Carousel," "The Sound of Music" is not the sound of writers perfecting their 
art or, as in "Allegro," stretching themselves. No, for this 1959 musical, 
their last one together, they provided songs in patterns or genres they'd 
already gotten down perfectly elsewhere -- "My Favorite Things" stands in for 
"I Whistle a Happy Tune" from "The King and I" and "Climb Every Mountain" for 
"You'll Never Walk Alone" from "Carousel." 
</P>
<P>
 Still "The Sound of Music" has its distinctions, and some of them can be seen 
at the Pantages Theatre until Aug. 21. In no other show do Rodgers and 
Hammerstein center so firmly on their own lifelong thesis -- the strange and 
extraordinary power of music. It can make you realize you're in love, guide you 
in the darkest storm; it can even distract Nazis while you make a getaway. 
</P>
<P>
 And if no one believed in the power of music with as much simple faith as 
Rodgers and Hammerstein and their heroine, the wayward nun Maria, probably few 
people believe in it with as much wholesomeness as Osmond. Blessedly, the star, 
who does look like Barbie come to life, sings well, as does the entire cast. 
She has a clear, full voice that is mature and restrained, a surprise for 
anyone who has studiously avoided her since the days of the "The Donny and 
Marie Show." Her acting is unaffected. Any fears (or hopes) that she would top 
the near-disaster her brother Donny suffered in the 1982 Broadway revival of 
"Little Johnny Jones" are immediately assuaged. But she is limited by that 
wholesomeness. Her Maria goes from virginal ignorance (with outbreaks of spunk) 
to matron with nothing in between, certainly not desire. Next to Osmond, Julie 
Andrews look like a vixen.  
</P>
<P>
 As Capt. Von Trapp, Laurence Guittard does not help romantically, unless you 
find William F. Buckley a honey. Gone is any trace of the boyish charm Guittard 
displayed as Curly in the 1979 revival of "Oklahoma!" on Broadway. Instead, he 
has matured directly into the pompous fool he played in "A Little Night Music" 
several years before. 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie version, two secondary characters, Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Jane 
Seaman) and Max Detweiler (John Tillotson) were robbed of their songs, among 
the most interesting in the score. Here, the characters are restored to their 
full importance, but Max, conceived by Tillotson as an uncloseted homosexual, 
seems from the wrong decade entirely. Seaman is quite human as the kind of 
overly plucked and penciled woman that children hate. She fights a losing 
battle, though, with Jonathan Bixby's hideous costumes, which ask us to believe 
a woman of Elsa's wealth and sophistication would wear a sparkling gown of 
green, silver and purple with maroon gloves or a beige pants suit with visible 
panty line. (Don't even ask about Maria's return-from-honeymoon outfit.) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Claudia Cummings is a warm Mother Abbess with a gorgeous voice; she makes you 
want to sign up as a novitiate. The children are inoffensive, with Sara Kate 
Zelle as Brigitta as the standout. Before Zelle, I never realized that these 
children actually have distinct personalities and that Brigitta is the smart 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Peter Jampolis' interior sets look lavish only if he keeps the lights 
low. The exteriors look like drops from a touring show, which is what they are. 
But if the mountains are not inspirational, they are not obtrusively amateurish 
either.  
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Hammerstein's son James directs with obvious and deep respect for his 
father's aesthetic. In this far-away age, he takes us about as close to the 
source as we can be expected to get. 
</P>
<P>
 For many people, "The Sound of Music" is a return to childhood, when the image 
of wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings was a deeply romantic one. 
In order to hear, beneath the cliche, the beautiful strain of music to carry 
you there, one must experience this show from a pre-critical place. Believe it 
or not, Marie Osmond is a credible guide there.

SALONEN'S CONCERT AND SLIDE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't just another Tuesday night at Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 After seven weeks with eight guests of various capabilities manning his podium 
(and, alas, none womanning it), Esa-Pekka Salonen returned to the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic. He even brought along Gidon Kremer, a bona fide stellar soloist 
(contrary to popular impression, stars don't always shine at Cahuenga pass). 
</P>
<P>
 Our youthful music director, sporting a trim new haircut, used the occasion -- 
the first of four -- to preview (rehearse) some of the repertory scheduled for 
the orchestra's Europe tour, which begins in Helsinki on Aug. 27. At the end of 
the program he also offered a surprise in the form of a slide show. 
</P>
<P>
 The excuse for the unexpected and, we think, unprecedented art-appreciation 
class in the wide open spaces was a performance of Hindemith's "Mathis der 
Maler" symphony of 1934. The music is derived from Hindemith's opera of the 
same name, which examines the aesthetic, political, intellectual and spiritual 
dilemmas facing Mathias (a.k.a. Mathis) Grunewald as he painted the Isenheim 
Altar. 
</P>
<P>
 There can be no question that Grunewald's bold 16th-Century images of the 
crucifixion -- images that were to influence all manner of 20th-Century 
expressionism -- were central to Hindemith's inspiration. Nevertheless, his 
music represented a remote abstraction, at best, of Grunewald's art. Salonen 
made the mistake of trying to make the connections between sound and sight 
literal. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of 50 overviews and details from the Isenheim masterpiece were 
projected on all-too small screens at either side of the Bowl proscenium. The 
pictures did not enhance the performance. In fact they distracted from its 
impact, reducing the symphonic contribution to a background soundtrack and, 
even worse, suggesting visual relationships unsupported by the music. 
</P>
<P>
 The innocent viewer was led to believe, for instance, that one fleeting 
passage illustrated a specific detail from Grunewald's "Concert of Angels" or 
that a certain contrapuntal melody actually represented "The Temptation of St. 
Anthony." The distant slide of the moment may have been fascinating, but it 
also was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 In this context, the score had to be trivialized by the art. The projections 
constantly contradicted the moods, dynamic structure and development so 
carefully delineated by the composer. For all their undeniable significance and 
pathos, the visual aids were ultimately misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 In his brief introductory remarks, Salonen announced that he would like to 
conduct Hindemith's complete opera in Los Angeles soon. That, of course, would 
be a far more illuminating, far better-focused tribute to both Hindemith and 
Grunewald. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bowl performance can be regarded as a down-payment, the prospects for 
eventual excellence are excellent. With eyes closed, it was easy to appreciate 
the hot heroic sweep and the cool analytical precision enforced by Salonen. It 
also was reassuring to hear the mighty Philharmonic play for its boss with 
equal degrees of bravura and finesse. Well, almost equal. 
</P>
<P>
 The first and more conventional half of the program was devoted to Salonen's 
countryman, Sibelius. The maestro used "Finlandia" as a stately overture. Then 
he accompanied Kremer in a rather unsettling performance of the hum-along 
Violin Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 Kremer, outfitted in a black shirt and yellow dinner-jacket, seemed subdued if 
judged by his own flamboyant standards. Perhaps he was too busy reading the 
score to indulge in his usual emotive acrobatics. His playing, in any case, 
turned out to be exquisite one moment, haphazard the next, sometimes 
excruciatingly elegant, sometimes annoyingly fussy. Salonen and the orchestra 
provided essentially neutral, occasionally plodding support. 
</P>
<P>
 One couldn't help comparing this uneven, aggressively theatrical performance 
with the serene, refreshingly lyrical one mustered recently by young Sarah 
Chang with the San Diego Symphony under Yoav Talmi. Sometimes, as St. Anthony 
said (or was it Arnold Schwarzenegger?), less is more. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the program magazine, Ernest Fleischmann, the Philharmonic's top 
administrative guru, called Gidon Kremer "probably the most interesting of the 
world's great violinists." One wonders what that judgment does for the other 
fiddlers on our orchestral roof. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bing Wang served as concertmaster in the Sibelius concerto. Her name does 
not appear in the official Philharmonic roster. 
</P>
<P>
 * When Salonen and the Philharmonic take "Mathis der Maler" to Helsinki, 
London and Frankfurt, the slide show will be left at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Bowl concert was embellished with six airplane ostinatos, one 
conspicuous wine-bottle crescendo on the concrete steps, and cheers from yet 
another modest midweek audience, this one tabulated at 8,127.

O.C. POP BEAT: JANETVISION: RHYTHM ISN'T IN THE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You knew a big extravaganza was in the offing when the sort of excited, 
stentorian hype-mongering voice only heard in old movie trailers started 
huffing and puffing about "the rhythm" before a single beat of Janet Jackson's 
show had even been struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rhythm. The rhythm controls us . . . the rhythm is here . . . love 
together in one rhythm . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The extravaganza arrived with all the flash one expected, and more. But it 
wasn't about rhythm, or any other musical element that might forge a sense of 
united purpose and shared experience between audience and performer.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson turned her fans into consumers of visuals, not participants in a 
shared experience of rhythm. This wasn't "Soul Train," where the audience is 
invited to groove along, but "The Outer Limits," where somebody else takes 
control of the programming, and you sit back and watch. 
</P>
<P>
 For 100 minutes Tuesday night, a near-capacity house at Irvine Meadows did 
just that. It stood and watched, waiting to see what fantasy would be enacted 
next, what entertainment conceived, packaged, and precision-delivered by 
Jackson would be served up for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 This was television by other means, and watching television is the most 
passive form of entertainment. You could even watch most of Jackson's show on 
TV, thanks to the three large screens that dominated the multilevel stage set, 
and the two even larger ones flanking the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's show was entertaining, on a grand scale befitting a TV variety show 
or a particularly spectacular Las Vegas floor show. Flash pots went off. A 
changing array of colorful, sexy costumes appeared. A phalanx of supporting 
dancers, lithe, comely and nimble, bobbed, skipped, strutted and whirled in 
combination with the lithe, comely, nimble star. 
</P>
<P>
 The machinery didn't allow Jackson to be personal, or impressively musical. It 
was, in fact, rather short on real, motivating R & B. The show's function 
clearly was not to be thought-provoking. It was aimed at the Chauncy Gardener 
in us all, the part that just likes to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For sheer spectacle, it would be hard to top "This Time," which Jackson turned 
into a morality play decked out with all the stormy trappings of an old 
Hollywood horror film. Burning candles appeared out of nowhere; a spooky fog 
enveloped the scene. The star presided as a mysterious, regal vampirette in an 
elaborate, velveteen robe. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario called for a vulnerable-looking, barefoot female dancer in a red 
dress to be smacked about by a brutish Stanley Kowalski type, only to emerge 
triumphant in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the approving eye of regal Janet, who intoned the chorus, "This time 
you've gone too far, this time I'm not gonna stay, this time you have got to 
pay," the woman in red got the drop on her attacker and beat him senseless. 
Call it even? Nah. With the now-helpless Stanley restrained by a cadre of woman 
assistants, the lady in red committed a form of Bobbitry, finishing him off by 
slamming a spike into his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Jackson figures that everyone will be so swept up by the spectacle of it 
all that no one will question the morality of a morality play in which 
cold-blooded murder is made to seem like just deserts for spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 One also wonders whether Jackson has any queasiness, in light of the murder 
allegations against O.J. Simpson, about casting a black man and a white woman 
in a violent vignette that ends in the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson is in control of the picture, and we're not supposed to ask any 
questions about Janetvision, much less relate it to a world off screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Jackson isn't "doing" social consciousness these days -- that was 
her last album, "Rhythm Nation 1814." On this album, "janet," she's doing sex. 
For $25, you could buy a T-shirt showing the Rolling Stone magazine cover shot 
of Jackson in unzipped jeans and nothing on above the belly button except for 
her lover's strategically placed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no such revelations on stage, and nothing all that risque. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throb" would have worked as a good, steamy funk workout even without a canned 
track of orgasmic noises (musically, it was one of the hottest numbers in a 
show that settled into too many smooth, cool, mid-tempo grooves and could have 
used more heat). 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's Wait Awhile," a 1986-vintage song in which a virginal protagonist 
sweetly tells an eager boyfriend to cool his jets, is considered Jackson's 
statement in favor of chastity. Here, she caressed herself as she sang, as if 
to suggest a fast-approaching, hard-to-contain sexual ripeness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the smoothly seductive "Any Time, Any Place," Jackson used the old ploy of 
pulling someone out of the crowd to serve as designated love-interest, creating 
an illusion of availability on the star's part. She cooed and rubbed while the 
lucky guy acted embarrassed, then amorous. 
</P>
<P>
 In a show that left nothing to chance, he was almost certainly a plant. If 
not, given today's legal climate, Jackson's public beneath-the-shirt fondling 
of the fellow's stomach and chest might give him a sexual harassment claim 
against a very, very rich defendant, supported by 14,000 or so eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 You can imagine the testimony: "I may have looked as if I was enjoying it at 
the time, your honor, but now I feel tremendous mental pain and anguish over 
having been exploited as a sex object in front of so many people." Jackson 
would surely pay a cool sum in settlement just to make such a case disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes there was just too much to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 In a medley of "When I Think of You," "Escapade" and "Miss You Much," an array 
of figures in dazzling jester's motley danced capriciously around the star, 
while a huge, inflated clown figure lolled at the back of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The eye-glutting staging might have had more charm if it had been more tightly 
focused on Jackson and two or three dancing sprites, instead of six or seven. 
It was charming, though, to see the casual repartee between Jackson and her 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their wordless byplay seemed less a choreographed response than an expression 
of genuine fondness. That playful quality was most evident during a loosely 
structured encore in which Jackson, dressed down in jeans and flannel, seemed 
to be hanging out in the 'hood with her pals, just for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst bit of staging was the much-discussed crying jag that begins on cue 
midway through the lovelorn ballad, "Again." Everyone knew it was coming: "Cry, 
Janet, cry," yelled one fan as Jackson neared her scripted breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came, Jackson's face clouded over, her voice trembled, her body shook, 
and, finally, she buried her head in her lap. The problem wasn't that this 
embarrassing display was calculated -- even rock's icon of spontaneity, Neil 
Young, has been known to repeat a sensational gesture from night to night for 
emotional effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that it was bad acting of the worst sort. Maybe if Jackson saw 
an Emmylou Harris concert, the idea would sink in that sorrow rendered with a 
woman's dignity is more moving than sorrow rendered with childish histrionics. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Jackson's little episode came just as she was beginning to show 
some above-average vocal ability by holding onto a sustained note with 
surprising force and determination. She needs more instances when all 
extracurricular activity stops and the focus is on her voice, her ideas and her 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is clearly a hard-working performer who likes being on stage, and she 
has grown into a competent singer in a breathy, Diana Ross sort of way. Jackson 
should play it straight and simple from time to time -- for example, by 
attempting an old-line soul number like "What'll I Do," the Steve Cropper song 
that she covered on "janet" but did not perform in her show. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented some funky or soulful basics, a listener can dance, hum along, or 
just let the songs filter through the imagination. Overwhelmed by a visual 
blitz like Jackson's, we are reduced to watchers, eyes glued to a stage that 
might as well be the world's biggest television screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening act was MC Lyte, a rapper from Brooklyn. Lyte showed a spark of 
intelligence and storytelling ability on her first three albums. But on her 
most recent release, the charmless "Ain't No Other," Lyte has decided that only 
the tough and the crude can survive in the hip-hop marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 25-minute set wasn't even tough: Evidently, Lyte didn't think a Janet 
Jackson crowd could take her crude stuff, so she served up dull, sanitized 
raps.

THEATER REVIEWS; 'PVT. WARS' DEFENDS LAUGHTER AS THE BEST MEDICINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James McLure's "Pvt. Wars" is one of those plays that young actors love to get 
their teeth into. It's about three veterans careening around a VA hospital, 
finding their own special bonding in an effort to save what's left of their 
sanity, which they do with a magnificent sense of humor and a touching 
understanding of each other's malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
 It also is that rare anti-war play that accomplishes its magic without 
mentioning war. It's a fable about the leftovers of war, a funny and sad 
picture of what greedy industry does to the innocents who fight its battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Kulczyk has directed this production at the Irvine Community Theatre with 
an incisive emotional through-line: Ignoring the play's lack of plot, he 
concentrates on the fascinating mosaic McLure has created out of the mental and 
emotional games his characters play with themselves and with each other to 
maintain some sort of control over their healing. 
</P>
<P>
 The three actors obviously enjoy their assignments and give the action some 
quirky flights of fancy that make the play work. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Dolton's Gately is a by-the-book performance, making its points clearly 
and with a sense of the character's distraction. But Dolton hasn't always found 
the dreamlike quality in Gately, the gentle tunnel vision that keeps him 
repairing a radio whose parts keep disappearing.  
</P>
<P>
 This Gately is too frenetic, an approach that keeps his most touching scene -- 
a description of a visit from his fiancee, whom he doesn't recognize -- from 
being as heartbreaking as it could be. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Hebler's Silvio is a whirling dervish of a performance. It's 
inventive, and Hebler doesn't make the mistake of telegraphing Silvio's injury. 
That injury is part of the past, and Silvio lives in the minute: volatile, 
joking, psychotic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Equally original is Timothy Titus' Natwick, a mother's boy preppie from Long 
Island, uptight but with a humor that is his salvation. Titus doesn't play the 
role in the usual effete manner. There is a puckish masculinity about this 
Natwick that couldn't be more revealing of the character's attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kulczyk's use of energetic tempos is just right; it doesn't interfere with his 
edge of empathy throughout, or with his ability to put on the brakes when 
McLure's dialogue requires them. With humor and stylization, "Pvt. Wars" makes 
a statement about survival that is wise and affirmative. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Pvt. Wars," Irvine Community Theatre, Turtle Rock Park, Irvine. Fridays and 
Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sunday, Aug. 14, 2 p.m. Ends Aug. 20. $8. (714) 857-5496.

THEATER REVIEWS; IN 'CAMELOT,' ARTHUR RULES WITH A GOLDEN VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lerner and Loewe's "Camelot" has always been a problem musical, and for very 
good reasons, some of which are solved in a generally top-notch production at 
Saddleback College's McKinney Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 From its Broadway opening with Richard Burton as King Arthur, the show has 
mostly been a starring vehicle for actors who act but whose singing is little 
more than speaking on key. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also very long, and many of its bus-and-truck tours have trimmed its 
running time. Many musical directors have entirely too much respect for its 
score, trying to give it a grandeur it never had. It's a Broadway musical, not 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is simple, and the show needs the richness of all its detail. This 
production is about as full of that detail as you'll find. The book is in the 
correct balance here, with an Arthur (Peter Wagner) who can sing and act, and a 
director (Blake Gould) who has allowed the entire company importance instead of 
just a "name" signed to sell tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Musical director John Massey Jr. sets just the right tone in his rousing 
overture, with an orchestra small enough and sassy enough to sound like a 
Broadway pit band. He keeps the score moving at perfect tempos, including good, 
bright paces even for the lush ballads. Just like they do on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical tone established, Gould sparks the action with brightness and a 
fine sense of the piece's special requirements, from its moments of misty magic 
to its comic flights to its romantic interludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Huntoon's fine mobile scenic design of crenelated castle walls and 
forest trees built like resting serpents is made up of segments that move onto 
and off the stage and into varying combinations with utmost ease and invention. 
And Kevin Cook's imaginative lighting design surprises with slivers of golden 
light in a darkening sunset sky and a stark, blood-red panorama when 
Guenevere's at the stake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner's Arthur is the director's key to the mood of the whole production. 
Wagner is young enough to be convincing as the boyish Arthur, who doesn't think 
he can think, and mature enough to make believable Arthur's transition into a 
proper monarch with social ideas far ahead of their time. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner also has a fine musical comedy voice that allows one to hear the 
melodies in Arthur's songs for a change, and an infectious sense of humor that 
gives his Arthur a welcome freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Hoffman is a proper Guenevere, with a crystalline soprano that gives 
just the right lightness to such melodies as "Before I Gaze at You Again." 
Carlos Romero is a delight as both the omnipotent Merlyn and the low comic King 
Pellinore, and Brent Ries' boyish good looks and flashing smile make the evil 
oozing from his Mordred potent and unsettling. Beth Hansen's Morgan le Fey has 
a gentle comic undertone that's just right. 
</P>
<P>
 In a company that's mostly on target, Lance Phillips' Lancelot seems oddly out 
of place. He has a glorious operatic baritone that performs minor miracles with 
"If Ever I Would Leave You," but he plays Lancelot as though he's doing grand 
opera: stodgy, slightly pompous and with a touch too much maturity. There is 
none of the boyish naivete that would help make Lancelot's self-importance and 
superior airs attractive. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; THEE HYPNOTICS PROVIDE A STONE-COLD TROUBADOUR SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Between record company chief Rick Rubin's weakness for classic-cum-retro acts 
(e.g., the Cult, Black Crowes) and the clone mentality of their record producer 
(Black Crowe Chris Robinson), it wasn't exactly a surprise that Thee Hypnotics 
would come across like a Rolling Stones homage in their show at the Troubadour 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The English band wore the scruffy, surly look of the brat-era Stones like a 
costume, but didn't have the charisma to bring it to life.The group's 
variations on the Stones' bedrock style lacked an individual stamp, and singer 
Jim Jones gave no sense of commenting on the poses he and the players were 
adopting -- as if they were meant to be taken seriously at face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in this deeply indebted state, the band has come up with some flavorful 
moments on its last two albums, but at the Troubadour it bypassed its murky 
trance grooves and haunted lounge music and went straight to its more 
straightforward, harder-edged material, finding its best moment in the oozing 
country lament "Goodbye."

ART REVIEWS; 'WOVEN WATER' A KITSCHY, FANTASTIC VOYAGE UNDER THE SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walking into "Woven Water," Maria Fernanda Cardoso's enchanting installation 
at Ruth Bloom Gallery, feels like falling into a dream. Thousands of starfish, 
seashells and sand dollars -- suspended from the rafters, attached to the walls 
and stacked on the floor -- make you feel like a big fish in a beautiful 
aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 The tips of the starfish have been wired together to form undulating, organic 
nets that float overhead like constellations in the night sky, or cluster 
underfoot like synchronized troupes of tiny, stylized ballerinas. 
</P>
<P>
 The slender, pointed shells of sea snails, which resemble hollow, slightly 
curved pencils, have been slipped inside one another to form translucent 
scribbles spiraling through space like nonsensical handwriting. Artificially 
colored scallop shells are stacked like poker chips, and sand dollars are 
strung together like enormous necklaces that also resemble the vertebrae of 
fantastic creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso's delightful installation shares many characteristics with the 
submarine ride at Disneyland. Both are upfront about their fakery, appealing to 
visitors who willingly suspend disbelief. Neither piece of theater actually 
takes you into the sea, preferring instead that you visit the watery depths in 
your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 After a while, the initial, illusory magic of Cardoso's sculptures falls flat: 
Her labor-intensive installation begins to look less like a dream and more like 
the decor of a cheesy seafood restaurant in the suburbs. The artist's 
impressive inventory of seashells simultaneously recalls the handcrafted 
knickknacks sold in souvenir shops near harbors and beaches all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from diminishing the power of Cardoso's art, however, these affinities 
with kitsch bolster the impact of her sculptures. The Colombian-born, 
Yale-educated and San Francisco-based artist mimics the formal elegance of 
Minimalist abstraction not to purge traces of touristic cliches from her work, 
but to emphasize connections among far-flung realms of culture. 
</P>
<P>
 With barbed wit, Cardoso proposes that modern art is just another form of 
tourism. Like visits to out-of-the-ordinary, often exotic lands, art's 
significance depends upon context, knowledge, history and point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheap souvenirs are intrinsically no more or less interesting than modernist 
abstractions. What counts are the ways you distill significance from Cardoso's 
promiscuous blends of natural materials and cultural forms, making meaning out 
of smart hybrids in which metaphors freely mix and contradictions abound.

 Sofa Showroom: Part garbage dump, scavenger hunt, Christian myth and art 
historical sendup, Carter Potter's installation at TRI Gallery is also a 
cleverly compressed self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Potter's Field," the L.A.-based artist's ongoing project consists of 
two tidy piles of thrown-out couches that currently cover the floor of the 
small back gallery. Each day, for the duration of the exhibition, the 
33-year-old Potter adds a junk sofa picked from the neighborhood. By the show's 
end, the room will be filled to overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
 His growing accumulation of stained, slashed and stripped-down couches refers 
to the burial ground for the indigent and friendless, first mentioned in the 
Bible when money that Judas was paid to betray Jesus was inherited by the city 
authorities and donated to the low-budget cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter's modern gloss on the final resting place for the destitute offers a 
quick sketch of the hard-luck neighborhood of the new gallery, acknowledging 
the steadily increasing number of homeless people on Hollywood's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Potter's Field" also surveys a major component of the artist's work. Over the 
past five years, Potter has pieced together sculptures with found couches and 
chairs, sometimes affixing them to the wall and at other times arranging them 
in Minimalist-inspired configurations. Those tattered pieces of furniture mock 
the middle-class idea of buying art to match the sofa and ridicule the 
requirement that art be pristine, neat and perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 His current arrangement of discarded couches is indiscriminate or 
acompositional. It pays tongue-in-cheek homage to Potter's artistic forebears, 
repeating the once daring and now cliched impulse to fill galleries with 
garbage, dirt, blocks of wood or stacks of bricks. Following upon Franz West's 
celebrated installation of colorful public benches in the Museum of 
Contemporary Art's courtyard, "Potter's Field" appears to be the dumb, ugly 
cousin of such international ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 His abandoned sofas cast such anonymous yet monumental gestures in more 
personal terms. These damaged pieces of furniture silently bear witness to a 
host of domestic dramas, to past naps, conversations and comforts that Matisse 
found in his armchair and that Potter finds on curbsides all over the city.

 Sexual Boredom: Paul Botello's intimately scaled acrylics on canvas and board 
depict images never found in his more well-known murals. Sexual reveries take 
explicit shape in the L.A.-based artist's 22 boldly colored paintings at 
Granados 2 Gallery. Nude couples fondle, kiss, have sex, swoon, float into the 
sky and fuse with the landscape. Unfortunately, Botello's paintings of men and 
women engaged in intimate embraces seem schematic and impersonal, as if the 
subjects of his images are not real individuals but generic types. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Botello's vivid, supposedly private pictures have not been painted 
for public commissions and thus don't need the approval of boards or 
committees, they are nevertheless constrained by a style more suitable for 
murals than personal meditations on sex. Intimacy's extremely individual 
character gets lost in his readily accessible images. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of this is intentional. Titled "Sacred/Savage," Botello's exhibition is 
meant to transcend individuality, to reach back to a base animal nature that is 
so vital and uncorrupted that it catapults us into the realm of religious 
transcendence. But Botello's flat, brusquely painted works do not carry viewers 
into these mysteries.

TV REVIEW; 'IN SEARCH OF ANGELS' SHOWS ONLY A HALO OF SUBSTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Now we're in the midst of an angel movement," says Sophy Burnham, author of 
the nonfiction bestsellers "A Book of Angels" and "Angel Letters." No kidding: 
That light flapping you hear in the air is the sound of cash being counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's "In Search of Angels" on KCET-TV Channel 28 is the second prime-time 
special in three months to address the phenomenon, following on the wing-tipped 
heels of NBC's "Angels" in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter major-network special was full of average citizens' tales of 
real-life encounters with spooky harbingers of benevolence. PBS takes a 
somewhat different tack, ditching the supernatural anecdotes, substituting a 
faintly patronizing tone for credulousness and focusing more on angels as a 
historical-artistic motif. Yet it's ultimately about as thin a treatment of an 
interesting subject as the more populist show. 
</P>
<P>
 Where "In Search of Angels" feels thorough in its search is in recounting 
cherubim and seraphim as favored subjects for paintings and movies. Clips 
ranging from fantasy-angel comedies -- such as "Forever Darling" and "Heaven 
Can Wait" (both featuring James Mason as heaven's emissary!) -- to the 
surprisingly theologically correct "Wings of Desire" and "Faraway, So Close" 
are glimpsed, as is a wealth of great medieval art. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, as the hour moves into the actual beliefs that billions hold 
dear, only one actual religious authority, a rabbi, is briefly interviewed, 
leaving other faiths unrepresented. The narration (read rather flatly by Debra 
Winger) delves all too easily into ecumenical over-generalizations: We're told 
that, although only the soul is believed by many to enter heaven, "in 
Christianity, both the body and soul of Mary, escorted by legions of angels, 
were assumed into paradise, where she was crowned the queen of heaven" -- an 
assertion that will come as a great surprise to hundreds of millions of 
Protestants. 
</P>
<P>
 What we do get in the place of religious leaders is a good deal of speculation 
from New Age-oriented author Burnham and, for reasons not explained, Rickie Lee 
Jones, who, as a theologian, remains a great singer-songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 * "In Search of Angels" airs at 7:30 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: NEW MAYOR IS SHOWING THE SOBER SIDE OF HIS BAD-BOY IMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MEET THE MAYOR: He seems more likely to be voted class clown, but this week 
Robert (Burgie) Benz, the beer-guzzling Hermosa Beach councilman who once 
exploded a cockroach and goldfish in a microwave oven on his local cable TV 
show, became the city's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want everybody up here to tell me when I get a little bit out of control 
because I've been known to do that," Benz said after a low-key ceremony at 
Tuesday's council meeting that was punctuated by only a single "whoop" from 
someone in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Benz, a self-employed engineer who is decidedly anti-government in his 
politics, was due for the mayor's position based on the council's rotation of 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old Benz has gained bad-boy celebrity status for his participation 
in the annual Fourth of July Ironman competition, a running, paddling and 
beer-chugging extravaganza that inevitably ends in mass upchucking. Despite his 
reputation, Benz's behavior at council meetings has been a bit more sober. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city is very lucky to have him," Benz's father, Donald L. Benz, 
said after his son was inaugurated as mayor. Benz's parents made a trip to 
Hermosa Beach from Portland, Ore., to attend the meeting.

 BUREAUCRATIC BARGAINS: For sale: Your own piece of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Style-minded local joggers soon could be sporting spiffy Torrance police 
T-shirts. The latest home decorating rage may be a Torrance water meter, 
artfully placed on a coffee table or sideboard. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials want to launch a city store to market used meters, street signs 
and traffic signals as well as a puzzle featuring a map of Torrance and even a 
Torrance board game. And, compliments of city engineers, residents may also be 
able to buy aerial photos of the streets on which they live. 
</P>
<P>
 The store would promote civic pride, said Felice N. Fromm, who is heading a 
committee that is trying to get the idea off the ground. "There's a lot of 
reasons why we would have one." 
</P>
<P>
 Not the least of which is raising more money for the city. The city of San 
Diego got its $12,000 investment back two months after it opened its store in 
1991, officials said in a recent report to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a new concept," Fromm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her committee wants the store to open before Thanksgiving, in time for the 
holiday shopping season. Still, a few hurdles remain, such as finding a spot 
with cheap rent. For instance, the city of West Covina's City Haul store gets 
discount rent at a local mall, helping it survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance City Council "liked the idea, but they don't want to spend any 
money," Fromm said. Estimated start-up costs are $15,000 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 No word yet on the availability of T-shirts decorated with the faces of 
Torrance's seven council members.

 SORRY, WRONG NUMBER, SORRY, WRONG NUMBER . . . : Teri Thomas of El Segundo 
says sharing a phone number with the O.J. Simpson hot line has been an 
interesting and educational experience. 
</P>
<P>
 True, she and her husband and children are a little tired of the phone ringing 
all day. On the other hand, she's become a sort of minor celebrity, featured on 
dozens of radio, TV news and talk shows around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a unique experience," says the 39-year-old housewife and mother. 
"It has put me in touch with a lot of different people." 
</P>
<P>
 It all started when Simpson's lawyers set up a toll-free 800 number for tips 
in the Simpson case. But the number, (800) 322-3632, was just an area code away 
from Thomas' home phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 24 hours after the hot line was set up, Thomas received more than 200 
calls from people who either couldn't get through on the Simpson 800 number or 
didn't understand the 800 number concept and simply dialed a Los Angeles area 
code and then the seven-digit number. The calls ranged from tipsters to people 
who had written songs in defense of Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The volume of calls has slacked off some, Thomas says. Now she only gets about 
two Simpson calls an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as bad as it was," Thomas says. "We still have to turn the ringers 
off the phone at night, and my answering machine has gone through 10 years 
service in the past couple weeks. But I've done about 40 interviews with radio 
stations all over the U.S. I was on the 'Rolanda' (TV talk) show. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to people from every state except Alaska and Hawaii. I even got a 
call from the Virgin Islands and one from London. It's pretty amazing. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll be glad when it's over."

WESTSIDE WATCH: FOR SINGLE DOG OWNERS, IT'S MORE THAN PUPPY LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For this group, the dog days of August are a time of great excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Single Dog Lovers' Assn. offers single Angelenos a chance to mingle twice 
a month, their beloved canines in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, about 45 participants, each with their dog, showed up for the 
month-old association's second get-together at Westwood Recreation Park. Paula 
Warner, 34, a Brentwood resident, organizes the two-hour events, which are free 
and provide doggie treats, lemonade and "people treats." 
</P>
<P>
 Warner says she has received at least 100 phone calls from interested dog 
lovers. (The association's number is (310) 575-4156.) Soon, she hopes to 
organize group mountain climbing and dining at animal-friendly restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Participant Connie Kupper of West Los Angeles says the group offers the 
perfect opportunity to meet a man who isn't found wanting when it comes to 
canine appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot tell you how many men have hit the road because they can't stand the 
attention I pay to my pets," she said. Kupper, 51, hopes to meet someone who 
"falls in love with my dog first, so then I can fall in love with him."

 SLIPPERY WHEN WET: A man who allegedly stole a car and led authorities on an 
80-m.p.h. car chase down Pacific Coast Highway soon ran out of options. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that swam out of options. 
</P>
<P>
 After plowing into two parked cars at Will Rogers State Beach, he abandoned 
the vehicle and made for the water, with deputies in hot pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "(He) ran into the ocean and started swimming away. I don't know if Catalina 
was his destination or not," said Sgt. Richard Gurr of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguards watched the man while deputies called for help from boat patrols, 
but they weren't needed. After five to eight minutes, the man turned around and 
headed for shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he finally got tired," Gurr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose name has not been released, was booked for investigation of 
auto theft, reckless driving and assault with a deadly weapon for ramming the 
cars, authorities said.

 EXCLUSIVE ENGAGEMENT: While Nine Inch Nails, Bob Dylan and Salt N' Pepa 
perform at the Woodstock Reunion concert in New York, Steve Saltzman of Santa 
Monica will be hosting his own Woodstock at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Saltzman won a drawing sponsored by KLSX (97.1 FM), a classic rock station, 
for a "Living Room Concert." The prize: Guess Who lead singer Burton Cummings 
will play a selection of songs in Saltzman's living room before a group of 
about 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, who joined Guess Who as lead singer in 1965, stayed with the 
Canadian-based band through the 1970s, singing such hit songs as "These Eyes," 
"American Woman," "No Sugar Tonight" and "Laughing."

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: BLACK BEARS PROVIDE LARGE DOSE OF REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of the residents of this county came here from elsewhere, including from 
some very large cities. And they brought a lot of big city notions with them -- 
which probably explains the five-way intersections, the skyscraper and all 
those cappuccino bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Some days, they can get to feeling quite hip and sophisticated and forget that 
they live in a largely rural and agricultural place. That's when the county has 
to give them a wake-up call. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it comes in the form of an ocean breeze sending a whiff of manure in 
through the kitchen window, to savor with the morning coffee. Or a trip to the 
back yard might reveal that deer have made a midnight snack of the new flower 
garden. Then again, skunks might settle under the house, while coyotes lay in 
wait for the cat. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is that rustling sound late at night, the one that can be heard 
after the kids have been tucked in and folks are settling down with a biscuit 
and a nice cup of Lapsong Oochong tea. 
</P>
<P>
 What is it? Just the sound of a black bear in the yard, eating the avocados. 
</P>
<P>
 So says Pancho Doll, who wrote this week's Centerpiece story on the large, 
pesky critters. According to Doll and his sources, the bear population problem 
is due to a decline in poaching. But the bear weight problem seems to be the 
result of a surfeit of picnicking. And the dish of choice seems to be avocados. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people in Ventura County are probably unaware that there is a bear 
living within a mile of their home," said Doll. And if that home has an avocado 
tree, watch out. 
</P>
<P>
 Doll knows a little something about bears, though he has yet to come across 
one in his own neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live near the beach and have no fruit trees," he said, "but I have seen a 
number of bears in my time. The first encounter was in Alaska where everybody 
carries a gun, usually a revolver, to protect themselves from the bears. The 
standard wisdom if you meet a bear in the woods is this: only shoot him five 
times, save the last bullet for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Doll does not encourage the use of firearms, nor does he advocate suicide in 
this story. But he does provide some tips on dealing with a behemoth if you are 
unlucky enough to meet one up close and personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "For this story, I principally talked to biologists and bear hunters," said 
Doll. "That is where I found Marsha Vaughan, probably the foremost woman bear 
hunter in North America, a designation that I'm sure gets her a cocktail in 
most any bar." 
</P>
<P>
 So what does Doll, an inveterate camper himself, do to discourage the large, 
ferocious creature from dropping by his campsite? "When I go camping in the 
woods I am very bear careful," he said. "I don't keep food in my tent, no 
chewing gum or even toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those tents are made of rip-stop nylon, but a 400-pound bear voids the 
warranty pretty quick."

SIGHTS; INTELLIGENT LOOK AT A TOUCHY SUBJECT; 'EROTIKOS' SUCCEEDS IN ITS 
ABILITY TO PROVOKE THE IMAGINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a history as long as humanity itself, erotica remains a dangerous and 
delicate area of interest. Subjectivity rears its head with special intensity, 
especially where eroticism merges with the art world. The line between 
prurience and sensuality, between aesthetics and baser provocations, is a thin 
blue one. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming away from "Erotikos," the current celebration of erotic/artistic 
instincts at Art City II, you leave with an ambivalent impression. On the 
whole, it's a good impression: This is a show, curated by artist Alex Morosco, 
that manages to deal with the subject from inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
 The show invites us to think about the different aspects of the theme, rather 
than just bask in its blue glow. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking into the gallery, suspicions are aroused by the looming presence of 
Doug Lipton's gaudy pavilion-like installation. Curtained-off, like the "adults 
only" section of your local videoteque, the assemblage artist's display is a 
shrine-like repository of erotic bric-a-brac. Note the phallic chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the end result of this collection of found objects has more to do with 
goofy kitsch than the business of base instincts. Without overt moralizing, 
Lipton points up the cartoony ludicrousness of the products of the porn 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God It's Only a Movie" is TV-minded assemblage artist sTeVe Knauff's 
contribution, dangling like a big plywood question mark in the far corner of 
the gallery. On his list of materials is "scrambled porn" -- images of tangled 
body parts from porno promotional materials on translucent film and applied to 
the face of a motorcycle helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more explicitly fleshy works in the show actually veer sharply 
away from standards of erotic diversion. Alain Sailer's striking paintings 
portray mutant, sometimes androgynous, anatomies that nod toward the influence 
of Salvador Dali's dream-world, flesh-phobic tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Morosco's own painting, "Leda and the Swan," presents a billowy, willowy 
merging of a female nude and a bird. Alex McDonald's "Dewdrop on Moonflower," 
with its unfurling shades of pink and red, follows the Georgia O'Keefe-ish 
agenda of macro-close-up floral imagery suggesting genitalia. Kakine's 
photograph, an ambiguous entanglement of limbs belonging to an indeterminate 
number of people, sides with subtlety.

<P>
 On the gallery floor are a healthy variety of three dimensional pieces. Often 
as not, humor takes the floor, as in Matt Harvey's "Fish Goddess," part frog, 
part human nude form and cowboy boots -- on the half-shell. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Duby's pun-happy "Tongue in Cheek," in almost fleshy pink alabaster, is 
a flowing form suggesting both a tongue and derriere. Neil Pinaster's "1-900" 
is similar to Duby's piece in its winking fusion of anatomy, though less 
enshrouded in coy innuendo. Frank Lauran's figurative tableau, "Rompers," 
depicts a nude couple romping, somehow, with a veneer of Norman Rockwell-ian 
innocence intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculptor John Lambie's slyly designed "Dancing Half Torso" is of the touch 'n' 
spin variety. The viewer is invited to activate the kinetic properties of the 
work, and, in the process, fondle the artist's finely detailed female 
genitalia. It's a bit of a cheap trick. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Lindhard's "Self-Love" has been shown before, but it represents one of 
the most successful "erotic" approaches of the lot. Half-abstract, 
half-anatomical, it exemplifies the essential equation of what makes erotica 
erotic, lying somewhere between what is seen and what is provoked in the 
imagination. 
</P>

 LINES AND SHAPES: Oregon-based artist Jan Schmitz goes in at least a couple of 
different directions, as seen in her show at the Ojai Center for the Arts. The 
exhibition, under the catch-all title "Figures and Surfaces," is a frilly and 
funny thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmitz oscillates between whimsical female figure studies and 
seep-and-splatter abstractions, sometimes structured around imagery of masonry. 
It's all pleasant to behold, if short on concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Also showing at the center is Ojai-based artist Stephen Bartomeo, whose works 
show a nice, loose painterly hand. His iconographic tendency is toward 
metaphysical scenes, but without any of that nasty New Age aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
 You might expect pretentiousness to reign in a painting entitled "Two Lovers 
Sleep While the Ever-Present Eye of Awareness Watches." Instead, it's a 
sumptuous two-shot portrait. "Baja on My Mind" is a ruggedly realized, folk 
art-inspired landscape, with the artist's typical, enviable blend of intuition 
and control. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 SUMMER FARE: "Collector's Gallery '94," now at the Conejo Valley Art Museum, 
is something of a mid-summer transitional show. The museum maintains a regular 
policy of showing works mostly by area artists on the fringes of its featured 
exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Here that sector takes over for a month. A number of notable pieces makes it a 
show worth checking into, whether or not you're a collector on the prowl. It's 
a summery show with a hidden agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Weston Relkin's "Hubba Hubba" resembles a festive, funky quilt. Gabor 
Korany's "Conqueror" evokes a sense of rustic folklore. Michael Appuliese's 
photographs of the Southwest have an economical grace, and Sylvia J.K. Simmons' 
"Earth Chant" is an abstraction with a dark, earthy palette, an iridescent 
sheen and a tactile allure. Details

CORPS SCALES DOWN PLAN FOR MARINA SEDIMENT REMOVAL; ENVIRONMENT: OPPOSITION TO 
BURYING SILT THAT CONTAINS HARMFUL SUBSTANCES IN A NEW WILDLIFE HABITAT SPURS A 
DELAY IN FORMAL REQUEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Faced with strong opposition, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has scaled back 
a proposal to haul tons of contaminated silt and sand from Marina del Rey to 
the Port of Los Angeles to use as fill for a new marine wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 In a concession aimed at winning approval for the controversial project, the 
Corps said it will seek permission to immediately remove only 130,000 cubic 
yards of the material, containing lead and dozens of other harmful substances, 
instead of the 530,000 cubic yards it had proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The action Tuesday came as the Corps asked the state Coastal Commission, 
meeting in Long Beach, to delay until September its request to remove the 
sediment, which has accumulated at the mouth of the county-owned marina and 
threatens to choke off boating. 
</P>
<P>
 At the behest of Los Angeles County officials, the Corps wants to remove the 
sediment, place it in special plastic tubes and bury the tubes in a shallow 
area of the harbor at San Pedro as part of the wildlife habitat project. (The 
state required that the habitat be created to offset the environmental effects 
of a major port expansion.) 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents warn that the dredging could cause environmentally damaging 
materials to spread at the mouth of the marina, and say the containers, which 
have never been approved for such a project in California, may leak once they 
are placed in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission had been scheduled to hear the matter Tuesday. The 
commission staff had recommended that the plan be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents said there was little in the latest proposal to allay their 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the Corps and the county) haven't dealt with unanswered questions in 2 
1/2 years, there's no reason to think they'll be able to in another month," 
said Roger Gorke, science and policy analyst with Heal the Bay, an 
environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an official with the County Department of Beaches and Harbors, 
which governs the marina, expressed optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that as the coastal staff and other agencies find out more about the 
technology involved (with the tubes), they will see that what is being proposed 
isn't unreasonable," said James A. Fawcett, the department's chief of planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have already closed 40% of the marina's north and south entrances 
to boating, and warn that unless the sediment is removed, runoff from heavy 
winter rains could choke off the marina entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Fawcett said that "barring weather that is truly out of the ordinary," the 
removal of 130,000 cubic yards of the material "would get us through the winter 
with a measure of safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being used for pleasure boating, the marina is the headquarters of a 
Coast Guard air-sea rescue unit whose proximity to Los Angeles International 
Airport is considered vital in case of a plane crash at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The marina's problems are largely the result of runoff from nearby Ballona 
Creek, which drains a 126-square-mile area from near Downtown Los Angeles to 
the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 During heavy rains, the creek pours up to 10 billion gallons of water a day 
into the ocean, depositing huge amounts of contaminated materials near the 
mouth of the marina. In places, sand, silt and dirt are barely three feet from 
the surface, making it difficult for pleasure boats to navigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dredging by the Corps has been a fact of life since the giant pleasure-boat 
harbor was built in the 1960s. But in recent years disposal has become 
problematic, as federal rules have become stricter. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Corps sought permission to dump the sediment into the ocean off 
Palos Verdes Peninsula, but the federal Environmental Protection Agency 
refused, saying the material was unsuitable for ocean disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Coastal Commission reluctantly allowed the Corps to use 
huge dredges to flatten the bottom of the marina channel, in a procedure known 
as a "knockdown," after county officials warned that the marina was about to be 
choked off. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the commissioners urged the county and the Corps to find a 
permanent solution, saying they were not likely to approve another stopgap 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld accused the Corps and county officials 
of dragging their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 She expressed concern that the commission was now being asked to consider "a 
matter of great local importance" in September, at its meeting in Eureka, 600 
miles away in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corps has said that unless it dredges the 130,000 cubic yards of sediment 
before the federal fiscal year ends Sept. 30, it will lose $1.7 million that 
has been allocated for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 To further complicate matters, Port of Los Angeles officials are wary about 
the plan, fearful that accepting the sediment will trigger a new round of 
regulatory hurdles just when they are ready to go forward with a planned 
$150-million port expansion.

CEMETERY DISPUTE MARS HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exactly what lies six feet under an old Civil War headquarters in Wilmington 
is being disputed, as plans to build affordable housing on the property move 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeological studies have found nothing under the development area except 
dirt, marine shells, glass and the odd golf ball core or plastic gaming chip. 
</P>
<P>
 But historians who operate the local Drum Barracks Civil War Museum believe 
the planned 38-home development would be directly over the bodies of seven or 
more nameless Civil War soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum director Marge O'Brien and her assistant Marc Weiser said the soldiers 
are buried in a cemetery somewhere near McFarland Avenue and Denni Street. The 
roads mark the eastern boundary of the 5 1/2-acre site where Urban 
Redevelopment of America plans to start building next month. The company bought 
the land from the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad in December. 
</P>
<P>
 With no marked graves and only a rough 1872 map of the barracks to go by, 
O'Brien and Weiser admit that the location of the cemetery cannot be 
pinpointed. But they have uncovered the service records of 24 men who were 
buried in a barracks cemetery between 1862 and 1866. 
</P>
<P>
 In Compton, a memorial in the Woodlawn Cemetery has been erected to honor 17 
unidentified men who were removed from a Wilmington fort cemetery in 1887. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien and Weiser are worried about the bodies of the other seven men, plus 
any more people who were buried in the area after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "These men gave their lives f or this country. Don't they deserve more than 
being buried under housing?" O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gene Wilson, vice president of the development company, said no evidence 
of the cemetery was found by the Archaeological Resource Management Co. in 
Anaheim, which was hired in response to the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologist Carol R. Demcak researched the history of the area, surveyed the 
site and dug four three-foot pits on the land in May and June. She concluded 
that no Civil War period artifacts or graves exist there. 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery, she said, must be in another part of the old Drum Barracks 
compound. In that case, the cemetery may have been covered by houses or streets 
long ago.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien and Weiser said they are not convinced that Demcak's findings are 
conclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only one of the four test pits is close to the site (where) we believe the 
bodies are buried," Weiser said. "And the bodies could easily be seven to eight 
feet down." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the museum is trying to solicit the help of an expert from Cal State 
Long Beach to do radar testing, which would detect any anomalies underground 
before the development proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just too big a lot to come in and excavate the whole site, but if they 
don't come in and do ground radar, there's definitely going to be that 
question: Did they build over bodies?" Weiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Demcak said radar testing will not work because overhead 
wires and a railway line through the center of the development site will create 
electrical fields that will interfere with radar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have asked for half of Wilmington to be dug up, but it did not seem 
appropriate, based on the fact that we couldn't determine exactly where the 
cemetery was located," Demcak said. "I am convinced that there is no historic 
cemetery in that (development) area." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilmington Drum Barracks were the U.S. Army Headquarters for Southern 
California and Arizona from 1861-71, providing both a strong military presence 
for the Union and a supply depot during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Historical records indicate about 7,000 soldiers passed through the barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavalryman Edward Welch, who the records say "died of disease" at the barracks 
on Jan. 11, 1866, was one of more than 100 soldiers buried at two cemeteries in 
Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most were buried in an old cemetery at Fries Avenue and Ross Place. A 
historical report by Walter Edwin Holstein in 1931 said human bones from some 
of those bodies were discovered during excavation for a sewer line. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien and Weiser said they hope the same type of discovery is not made 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are superstitious about these things," Weiser said. "I personally 
wouldn't buy a home if I knew there had been a cemetery there."

PARK TO GET UNDER WAY AFTER 19 YEARS OF DEBATE; RECREATION: THE HERMOSA BEACH 
COUNCIL VOTES NOT TO PUT THE ISSUE ON THE BALLOT FOR WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE 
14TH TIME. THE FACILITY SHOULD BE READY BY FEBRUARY. 
</P>

<P>
 The oceanfront lot in Hermosa Beach where the Biltmore Hotel used to stand 
will soon be transformed into a seaside park after two decades of debate and 13 
ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council had discussed putting the issue on the ballot again, but 
decided Tuesday on a 3-2 vote against asking voters to decide the issue for the 
14th time.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the Biltmore was razed in 1965, 13 ballot measures have been placed 
before voters to determine how to use the city-owned lot on the Strand between 
14th and 15th streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the last time the matter was put to a vote, residents approved the 
development of a park on the site, which is slightly less than an acre. The new 
ballot measure would have given residents an alternative -- to have 60% of the 
land designated for commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Julie A. Oakes, who said July 26 that she supported placing the 
measure on the November ballot because she believed an oceanfront park would 
create too many maintenance and security problems, voted against the plan this 
week. She was joined by Councilmen J.R. Reviczky and Sam Y. Edgerton.  
</P>
<P>
 After researching the issue recently, Oakes said, she came to believe the 
smaller lot abutting a park would not attract developers. "There's not much 
someone could do with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John Bowler said the city's financial situation has worsened since 
voters approved the park two years ago and said the development of a portion of 
the site could raise several million dollars for strained city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have 19 parks in a 1.3-square-mile town," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are under way for a sand and grass park, but the council voted to reduce 
spending from $89,000 to about $55,000 by eliminating night lights and several 
of the proposed concrete seatwalls, which are seawalls on which people may sit. 
The park is expected to be completed by February, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although residents will not vote on the development of the oceanfront lot, 
they will have a chance to vote next year on a ballot measure designed to kill 
a proposed oil-drilling project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the project collected 1,628 signatures to put an anti-drilling 
initiative on the November, 1995, ballot. Because they had not collected enough 
signatures in time to qualify the initiative for the 1994 ballot, they had 
hoped the council would vote to place the measure on this year's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council split on the decision, so the measure will probably appear in 
a November, 1995, election. Reviczky abstained from the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," said Hermosa Beach resident Rosamond Fogg, who spearheaded 
the signature drive. Fogg said she and other members of the Hermosa Beach Stop 
Oil Coalition are working to collect enough signatures to force a special 
election earlier next year. 
</P>
<P>
 After voters approved two pro-oil initiatives in 1984, MacPherson Oil Co. of 
Santa Monica was granted a lease from the city to drill 30 wells in a city yard 
at 6th Street and Valley Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald MacPherson Jr., president of the oil company, said a vote either way 
will have no effect on the project because he already holds a contract with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Robert (Burgie) Benz and Bowler opposed placing the measure on the 
ballot in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to bring in $40 million to $120 million in revenue to 
the city.

NEW DIGS IN THE MAKING; $3-MILLION PROJECT WILL EXPAND SERVICES OF OCEAN PARK

 Workers have begun refurbishing the Ocean Park Community Center to make it a 
combination shelter for the homeless and counseling center for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 A ceremony Wednesday marked the end of a three-year drive that raised $3 
million for construction of a 16,000-square-foot center on 16th Street in Santa 
Monica through private donations and grants from the federal and city 
governments, said community center spokeswoman Yumiko Carr. 
</P>
<P>
 "The center enables people to get back on their feet, and it provides a broad 
scope of services to the homeless and the needy," said Don Burkhimer, chairman 
of the fund-raising committee and a Sony Corp. senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the committee hopes to raise an additional $2 million to be used for 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The project should be completed within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the counseling center for battered women and their children 
will remain on Hill Street in Santa Monica, and the homeless shelter, which 
offers housing, job placement, training and other services for up to 55 
homeless people, will continue in temporary trailers on 16th Street. LORENZA

miles away in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corps has said that unless it dredges the 130,000 cubic yards of sediment 
before the federal fiscal year ends Sept. 30, it will lose $1.7 million that 
has been allocated for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 To further complicate matters, Port of Los Angeles officials are wary about 
the plan, fearful that accepting the sediment will trigger a new round of 
regulatory hurdles just when they are ready to go forward with a planned 
$150-million port expansion.

OLSEN CAMPAIGN LOSES BACKING OF RENTERS' GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica City Councilman Kelly Olsen has been bumped from the slate of the 
powerful renters' group that elected him four years ago -- the first time the 
group has failed to endorse one of its own incumbents seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprising turn of events capped a spirited, well-attended Sunday 
convention of the coalition, Santa Monicans for Renters Rights, which has long 
been the dominant political force in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 SMRR endorsed two women activists, Pam O'Connor and Bruria Finkel, to run on a 
three-person slate with incumbent Tony Vazquez. Two candidates failed to make 
the slate in the five-way race -- Olsen and Mike Feinstein, a slow-growth 
activist. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor is a historic preservation expert who serves on the Planning 
Commission. Finkel, an artist, is a member and past chairwoman of the city's 
Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women were supported in their bid by a year-old SMRR women's caucus, 
formed to help women candidates. Despite its longstanding support for gender 
equity, a vast majority of council members belonging to SMRR have been men. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen left the convention without comment, and is said to be considering 
running as an independent.  
</P>
<P>
 If all three SMRR-endorsed candidates win, the renters' groups would control 
six out of seven seats on the City Council. They control five seats now. 
</P>
<P>
 Their political opponents, who are trying to pick up a third seat in November, 
were pleased about the decision to drop Olsen, saying it showed that SMRR is 
out of touch with the concerns of Santa Monicans.  
</P>
<P>
 "They kicked off their only public safety candidate . . . the only candidate 
they could point to and say we are for safe streets and safe parks," said City 
Councilman Robert T. Holbrook, who is seeking reelection this year. "There's no 
question they shot themselves in the foot." 
</P>
<P>
 If Olsen's public safety stance gave him currency with voters, it worked 
against him among some factions of the renters' rights organization. Many of 
the group's stalwarts strongly opposed such Olsen measures as the youth curfew 
and closing down the parks at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Though other SMRR-backed council members -- Ken Genser and Paul Rosenstein -- 
also backed the public safety measures, Olsen often moved forward without 
conferring with the group's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor Dennis Zane said Olsen was a risk-taker who would have had a 
stronger showing Sunday if he had worked to build a consensus within the group. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "In a democratic organization, even incumbents can't take the membership for 
granted," said Zane, who backed the SMRR-endorsed candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 While the convention was highly-charged, it was not nearly as contentious as 
it has been in the last several years. The biggest flap involved Zane's 
confrontation with Feinstein outside the room over "bullet voting," in which a 
candidate's supporters cast a single vote for that candidate and do not support 
anyone for the other two spots on the slate. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullet-voting made it difficult for any candidate except Vazquez to get the 
required 50%-plus-one vote needed for the group's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Zane said Feinstein solicited new members beholden only to him, which skews 
the will of the group in favor of an individual's political career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bullet-voting is having a pernicious, factionalizing effect on this 
organization," Zane said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other candidates employed the same tactic Sunday, as has been SMRR 
practice in the past, many said. Indeed, Olsen won an endorsement four years 
ago by recruiting members and bringing them out to support him at the 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
 If Olsen runs as an independent candidate, his presence would be felt based on 
name recognition, and all the more if he were to win the support of the Santa 
Monica Police Officers Assn.

CITY OFFICIALS TO HONOR 150 OFFICERS AT BARBECUE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: MEMBERS OF 
NEIGHBORING POLICE AGENCIES STEPPED IN TO HELP AFTER THE MURDER OF TWO PALOS 
VERDES ESTATES OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates will honor more than 150 officers from surrounding cities 
who stepped in to protect the city after two of its officers were killed on 
Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 A barbecue, expected to cost several thousand dollars, will be held in 
September in Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The cost) is relatively minor compared to what they did for us," said Bill 
Yeomans, city finance director. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from surrounding cities performed duties ranging from patrols to 
press conferences after the Feb. 14 shootings of Sgt. Vernon Thomas Vanderpool, 
57, and Capt. Michael Tracy, 50, sent shock waves through the small Palos 
Verdes Estates Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy and Vanderpool were killed when gunman David Fukuto burst into a 
Torrance Holiday Inn meeting room during a motivational seminar for Palos 
Verdes Estates city officials. After the two officers were shot, other officers 
wrestled Fukuto to the ground. Fukuto died of head injuries and asphyxia in the 
scuffle, said Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, who ruled that the use of 
force in subduing Fukuto was justifiable. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 23 Palos Verdes Estates officers were given time off to grieve, 77 
Torrance police officers, 57 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, 33 Redondo 
Beach officers and 10 officers from other cities such as Hermosa Beach and Los 
Angeles helped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates Police Chief Gary Johansen said a few local officers 
patrolled after the killings, but were accompanied by outside officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want some guy going out there who was mad at the world . . . and 
having the guy overreact," Johansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayors of each city also will be invited to the barbecue, along with 
elected officials, city employees and police officers from Palos Verdes 
Estates, said Hilary Bloom, an administrative assistant who is overseeing the 
barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom is soliciting donations for the celebration from community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities did not bill Palos Verdes Estates for the use of their officers. 
Mutual aid agreements, allowing officers from different cities to assist each 
other during crises, are common, but having outside officers run another police 
department is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, one or two or three (officers) go on leave because the officers they 
were close to were killed," said Chief Dennis Martin, president of the 
Miami-based National Assn. of Chiefs of Police. 
</P>
<P>
 But the killings of Tracy and Vanderpool were the first in the history of the 
small, close-knit police department.  
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach Police Lt. Jeff Cameron, who was a spokesman for the Palos 
Verdes Estates department just after the shootings, said he was glad to help 
out.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was not like I was doing a job," Cameron added. "It was like doing 
something I was personally obliged to do." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, after a public hearing, the City Council unanimously approved a 
memorial to Tracy, Vanderpool and all Palos Verdes Estates veterans. The 
memorial, to be located across from City Hall in Memorial Gardens park, 
includes a sundial that every Feb. 14 will illuminate a plaque bearing the 
names of Tracy and Vanderpool.

 A former City Council candidate who has been fighting to save boulders and 
trees outside his home since 1992 lost his final appeal to the council Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously reaffirmed its decision that Massoud JavaDiZadeh's 
landscaping, located in a public right of way, violates city codes.City Manager 
James Hendrickson said the landscaping could be removed within one week. 
</P>
<P>
 JavaDiZadeh said the boulders and magnolia trees, which are not on the city's 
list of approved plants for his street, should be approved because the city 
code does not specifically address the placement of boulders. He also noted 
that banned trees stand outside the homes of other city residents, including 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Atty. Stephanie Scher said the code specifically addresses the 
placement of rocks, bricks and other materials. City officials added that 
because of limited resources the city only pursues egregious code violations or 
existing violations once homeowners request building permits. Massoud first 
sought a permit in February, 1992. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; VOTERS TO DETERMINE FATE OF FIREWORKS

<P>
 Voters will decide the future of Fourth of July fireworks in the April 
election, the City Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by the concerns of fire safety officials, the council voted 
unanimously to bring the issue up for a vote.Officials also said that, whatever 
the outcome, they will abide by it. 
</P>
<P>
 That hasn't always been the case: In a 1991 advisory ballot measure, voters 
rejected fireworks, but city officials never changed the law to ban them. A 
poll taken by the city before the ballot measure also showed that most people 
in Carson didn't want the noisy, smoky pyrotechnics in their city. 
</P>
<P>
 But city codes still allow fireworks to be sold by authorized groups between 
June 28 and midnight July 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Los Angeles County Fire Department officials again asked Carson to 
join other South Bay cities in banning fireworks. Only Carson, Hawthorne, 
Inglewood and Lawndale allow fireworks to be sold, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some nonprofit groups support fireworks sales because of the money they raise. 
City figures indicate that 27 nonprofit organizations sold more than $337,000 
worth of fireworks last Fourth of July. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; OFFICIALS REVISE LAW ON ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council approved an ordinance Monday aimed at regulating adult 
businesses while protecting First Amendment rights to free speech.  
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-0 vote, the council passed the law that allows the city to determine 
when, how and where adult businesses operate but not what they sell, said City 
Atty.Glen Shishito. 
</P>
<P>
 "These businesses are afforded First Amendment protection," Shishito said. "If 
we don't follow the law, we're open to liability."  
</P>
<P>
 Council members Steven Andersen, Martha Bails and Betty J. Ainsworth voted for 
the measure. Councilwoman Ginny M. Lambert abstained and Mayor Larry Guidi was 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's previous rules on adult businesses were vague and could be used to 
regulate what materials were sold -- in violation of the First Amendment, 
Shishito said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law requires new adult businesses to pass a checklist of standards 
that regulate the time and manner of conducting business, including the hours 
of operation and public display of adult materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't put them out of business," Andersen said. "This is about as much as 
we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are also changing the zoning codes to restrict adult businesses 
to certain parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert said she abstained as a protest against adult businesses: "I object 
strongly to that type of business in my community."

TOPICS / THEATER; TAKING YOUTHS OUT OF CROSS-FIRE, ONTO STAGE 
</P>

 Parents who believe that children should be seen, not heard, probably have not 
been to a play put on by Santa Monica's Virginia Avenue Project. If they had, 
they might have discovered that what some children have to say is indeed worth 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We write about our feelings instead of keeping them inside," says 12-year-old 
Adriana Torres, one of about 40 children in the group. "It helps me express 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old nonprofit theater company pairs children age 6 through late 
teens with professional actors. Sometimes the youths, most of whom are deemed 
at risk for ending up on the road to poverty or other trouble, perform original 
plays that adults write for them; other times they write plays for adults to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's goal is to give youngsters a reason to feel good about 
themselves, said executive director Kendis Marcotte. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are kids who are living in the cross-fire, living in the element and 
having a hard time of it," Marcotte said. "But they are not generally your 
hard-core group." 
</P>
<P>
 The children will take the stage during three performances Friday and Saturday 
at UCLA's Little Theater. Titled "Lost Luggage," the series of plays tops off a 
week the children spent in Ojai rehearsing scripts written for them by 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 In July the Virginia Avenue youngsters showed their talents as playwrights in 
a series of performances called "Second Thoughts" at the Little Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "It spoke a little strongly to my own life," says Ashby Semple, an actress who 
appeared in one of the plays, "Anything is Better. . . ," written by 
14-year-old Santa Monica High School student Ali Campoverdi. The audience gave 
it a standing ovation. The play explores feelings of loneliness and despair 
through the main character, called Nothingness, played by Pamela Tyson, who 
also appeared in the movie "What's Love Got To Do With It." 
</P>
<P>
 "I witnessed someone I know who was going through suicide, but it was like I 
couldn't express my feelings to them," Campoverdi explained. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Virginia Avenue Project was modeled after New York's 52nd Street Project, 
which started 11 years ago in Manhattan and now counts 650 child members. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Curran, who was involved with the New York group, is the artistic 
director of Virginia Avenue Project, named after its first home at a youth 
center on Virginia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The program runs on an annual budget of about $120,000, most of that coming 
from grants and private donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Curran has drawn about 40 steady actors who volunteer when they have time. 
Many of them worked with Curran in the 52nd Street Project and now live in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime kids can work with adults, it's a nurturing experience," said Bill 
Fagerbakke, who stars on television's "Coach." 
</P>
<P>
 "As a child, I never wrote, so I can only imagine what it feels like to be 
affirmed like that," says Amy Brenneman, a regular on "NYPD Blue" who has been 
working with the Virginia Avenue Project for about a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing, the extent to which they're treated like adults in this 
program," Brenneman said. "There's no patronizing them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Virginia Avenue group meets at Santa Monica Police Activities League Youth 
Center at 14th Street and Olympic Boulevard. The center has become the hangout 
for 80 to 120 children a day, said Patty Loggins, director of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are involved in the Virginia Avenue program have changed for the 
better, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One kid never even used to look you in the eye when you said 'hello' to him," 
Loggins said. "But after he was in one play, he was smiling and talking and 
shaking people's hands." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Virginia Avenue Project includes several classes such as "Creative 
Dramatics," which teaches acting, writing and performing. In "Playmaking and 
Replay," children learn how to write their own scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, the project plans to introduce "Playback," in which the youngsters 
will write half a script, an adult will write the other half, and the two will 
perform the play together. 
</P>
<P>
 And the young playwrights have a pretty nice arrangement when it comes to 
criticism: "We don't invite critics and critical comments from outside the 
group," Marcotte said. "This is a self-esteem program more than anything else."

NIGHT LIFE: J.D.'S LAST RIDE TO HEADLINE ACOUSTIC FEST; THE GROUP, WHICH CALLS 
ITSELF A 'VENTURA BAND,' FEATURES VOCALIST MARJORIE EXTRACT. IT PERFORMS 
SATURDAY AT DIZDAR PARK IN CAMARILLO. 
</P>

<P>
 The ghost of Jimi Hendrix will sit this one out, and air guitarists will wait 
for a more electric moment. It's Henson's 14th Annual Acoustic Music Festival 
that will go on all day Saturday at Dizdar Park in Camarillo, headlined by 
J.D.'s Last Ride, featuring powerhouse singer Marjorie Extract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of families and a pretty interesting crowd," said J.D.'s 
guitarist, Robert Ramirez, during a recent interview at the band's practice 
hangout. "It's cool. You can bring your own beer and a sack lunch. The cool 
thing is that (the festival) exposes people that normally wouldn't go out to a 
bar to see us. If we pick one or two new fans, hey, it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 The band, which also includes Paul Harrison on bass and Chuck Herrera on 
drums, has been around for four years, or since Robert met Marjorie one night 
at Charlie's in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got started because this dude came up to me after my band Scarlet Ribbons 
& the Johnny Yuma Five played," said the singer. "This guy turned out to be 
Robert Ramirez. Naturally, I gave him a fake phone number, but he found me, 
anyway. I've been playing with this guy ever since then." 
</P>
<P>
 Extract, one of the best local singers, will be making new fans even as she 
works on her tan at Dizdar Park. Her voice is so powerful that when she belts 
out "I need a man to love me," guys will be sweating for miles around. She's 
one of those "I saw her when" performers. She can do Patsy Cline, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, I am my own influence," she said. "But I get inspired by other people, 
such as Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star. I've only been singin' for about 5 1/2 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time, the band was lumped in with the pointy-shoe crowd and labeled 
as some sort of retro rockabilly outfit, even though it has obvious rock, 
country and even some surf influences. There's no Brylcreem in its future, and 
a ducktail is still just the end of the duck, says the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, we're tired of singing about hoppin' and boppin' and about how cool our 
car is," Ramirez said. "We play alternative roots music with emotion, but we're 
not a rockabilly band; but I think part of that had to do with the identity of 
an upright bass, which Paul no longer plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Extract, "We've been through so many phases and we're not pretentious at 
all. We never thought about what makes you popular. We've remained true to 
ourselves and created an original sound. And now we have a manager who has a 
lot of industry contacts." 
</P>
<P>
 So the band has the tunes, the singer, the manager, but not the big bucks, and 
so far, not a deal. They gig around Ventura and Santa Barbara playing the usual 
hangouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love to play at Eric Ericsson's because it's like Charlie's all over 
again," said Ramirez. "The Santa Barbara scene is too Flavor of the Month. It's 
a fun place to play, and a whole new crowd comes to see us, but we're a Ventura 
band." 
</P>
<P>
 Every band has a Humility 101 gig. J.D.'s Last Ride got that one out of the 
way one Tuesday night in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played at Joseppi's one night and the only person there was Joseppi 
himself," said the singer. "After a while, he walked out and we played to no 
one. We've had better gigs since that, though. We've played with the Stray 
Cats, the Blasters, Chris Isaak, Agent Orange, the Beat Farmers, the Reverend 
Horton Heat and the Paladins, so we've already played with all of our heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 The band has a four-song tape and a tight live show that includes 15 originals 
plus a couple of covers, "Killing Moon" by Echo & the Bunnymen and "Gone Ridin' 
" by Chris Isaak. Naturally, they want to record more, but only a handful of 
local bands make the big paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recorded 10 songs that we never quite finished because the songs just kept 
growing," said the guitar player. "Since we don't make that much money, it's 
been hard for us to pay for an album." 
</P>
<P>
 It was also hard for the band to even keep going when guitar player Tim 
Anderson died unexpectedly late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all been through hell a billion times this year," Extract said. "But 
now, we're more appreciative of our lives. At one point, everybody wanted to 
just quit, but now the band is stronger than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so who's J.D.? Some people still think the "J.D." is John Drury of Raging 
Arb & the Redheads. It's not; nor is it Jack Daniels, John Doe or John Denver, 
but it is James Dean, who knew a thing or two about bad rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the bill are the Convertibles, Mike Fishell and Steve White, Jacob's 
Ladder, Luke and the Drifters, Pleasant Valley, Ben Shearer and Zane Smith.

TOPICS / BRIEFLY; COASTAL COMMISSION: CHIEF DECRIES BUDGET PINCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warning of the potential for new budget cuts, the head of the state Coastal 
Commission says the agency may soon be unable to do "the minimum necessary" to 
protect California's 1,100-mile coastline from the pressures of development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's troubling that as our funds have continued to decline, the demands 
placed upon us have significantly increased," Peter M. Douglas, the agency's 
executive director, told commissioners Tuesday in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas submitted a wish list for the fiscal year that begins in July, 1995, 
while acknowledging there will probably be no money for any of the items on it. 
Among other things, the list calls for hiring a geologist, a water quality 
expert, four more enforcement officers, two lawyers and a cartographer. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have called it disgraceful that the agency, whose staff is often 
matched against experts hired by well-financed developers, has neither a staff 
geologist nor a water quality specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission's budget of $8.7 million for the fiscal year that began 
in July includes about $2 million from federal sources. Although it was the 
first time in several years that the agency's share of state funds escaped the 
ax, Douglas said the current budget may yet be slashed as a result of a new law 
that triggers across-the-board cuts if the state's financial picture worsens. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has shrunk from 169 employees in 1982 to 108 today. Officials warn 
that further reductions may be necessary because federal funds have begun to 
dry up. To further complicate matters, a wage increase of between 3.5% and 5% 
is to go into effect Jan. 1, and there is no money to pay for them, Douglas 
said.

CENTERPIECE: FRUITFUL & MULTIPLYING; OFFICIALS SAY THE STATE'S BEAR POPULATION 
IS THE LARGEST IN 10 YEARS. THE REASON? POACHING IS DOWN AND VENTURA COUNTY'S 
AVOCADO ORCHARDS ARE RIPE FOR THE PICKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Game warden John Castro was disgusted when he stepped into a bog at the lower 
Lion Campground in late June and found the decaying carcass of a female bear 
shot by poachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The gall bladder had been removed. So had the teeth and claws. 
</P>
<P>
 "The canines looked like they had been snapped off," Castro said. "It was 
pretty grizzly." 
</P>
<P>
 A gallbladder can easily fetch $50,000 in Asia where apothecaries use them to 
treat human stomach ailments and blood diseases. Teeth and claws are routinely 
used in jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 A Newbury Park man has been charged in the crime that stands out not only for 
its wantonness -- a 250-pound animal was killed for less than two pounds of 
parts -- but also for its rarity. Officials maintain that poaching has declined 
sharply and they cite that as one reason the state's bear population is the 
largest it's been in 10 years, maybe the largest ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that as many as 24,000 California black bears inhabit the 
state, a growing number of them in counties like Ventura, which has lots of 
bears. Big bears. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest black bear killed in North America was shot in the western 
tributaries of Piru Creek. The year was 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was big enough to cover a 4-by-8 piece of plywood," said Loren Nodolf, an 
offshore oil worker, who shot the record bear during the fall hunting season. 
"He must have had six inches of fat on him. We estimated he weighed 800 
pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Weight doesn't count in record books. Trophy bears are measured by the length 
and width of their craniums, and in addition to Nodolf's record bear, two other 
county bears had skulls big enough to be listed in Boone and Crockett Big Game 
Awards, the book of record for North American game trophies. GUACAMOLE 
</P>
<P>
 The individual size and overall numbers of bears is due, at least in part, to 
the 82,600 tons of avocados the county produced last year. Biologists report 
that bears are gorging themselves to obese dimensions on the calorie-rich fruit 
and reproducing with abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yep, there are some exceptionally large bears up there with nice shiny 
coats," said Morgan Boucke, a local wildlife biologist for the California 
Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 When high daytime temperatures cause avocados in Ojai and Fillmore to fall 
from the trees, bears from the surrounding Los Padres National Forest amble 
into orchards at night. By morning, their muzzles appear to be covered with 
guacamole. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Acosta, a game warden in Ventura County for 11 years, said irrigated 
orchards provide bears with a stable water supply and because the trees are 
pollinated by bees, a hungry bear can, after enjoying an avocado entree, take 
down an apiary for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 In bear-think, orchards are like fast-food drive-throughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Considine is one avocado rancher who doesn't much mind the intrusions. The 
Ojai grower has 20 acres of avocados surrounded on two sides by the national 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Considine said that between 2% and 5% of the fruit normally falls from the 
tree before it can be harvested, making it unmarketable. That amounts to as 
much as 10,000 pounds in his grove alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try not to bother the bears," Considine said. "Lots of ranchers get upset 
about it, but the loss to me is not more than I would normally have from 
seasonal drop. We kind of like the idea of having them in the grove." 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai grower Roger Essick is another grower who gets along fine with his 
nocturnal visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're right against the national forest," Essick said. "They don't know where 
the boundary is, so they have a right to hang around. They've broken a few 
branches over the years, but it's not a problem. We're kind of happy to have 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all ranchers are such gracious hosts. Fish and Game issued five 
depredation permits last year in Ventura County, which allow people to shoot a 
bear that's damaging property. None of the ranchers was able to get the 
larcenous bears in their gun sights. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall hunting season is a different story. Each year an average of eight 
bears are killed -- hunters prefer the euphemism "harvested" -- in Ventura 
County, and more than 1,000 bears are taken throughout the state during the 
season, which runs from October to December. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Oswitch, vice president of Animal Emancipation, a Ventura animal rights 
group, sees it as a harvest of shame. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that it's an anachronistic blood sport completely out of place in a 
society that's already so violent that people are afraid to go out at night," 
Oswitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Oswitch is the sort of person Marsha Vaughan is afraid of. Vaughan 
may be North America's foremost woman bear hunter. She's too modest to claim 
the title, but the bear she killed in 1990 above her Ojai home ranked 14th, the 
highest ranking for a woman hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing reprisals from animal rights activists, she declined to be 
photographed with her bear, which is displayed in her living room, frozen in 
mid step as if stalking the television. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal was so big, taxidermists had to use a grizzly bear mount, she said. 
The same was true of Nodolf's bear, which is in a Wyoming museum. Despite an 
average cost of $3,500 for a full body mount, preserving trophies is something 
of a passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nodolf keeps the record skull in his basement along with another osteal trophy 
-- a baculum, the long, slender bone most carnivores have in their penis. It's 
a collectible among bear hunters, some of whom have the baculum silver-plated 
and use it as a swizzle stick to stir their cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal right activists are stirred also. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I am concerned, it's not only a question of whether killing harms 
the population," said Michael Markarian, campaign coordinator for the New 
York-based Fund for Animals. "Hunters are harming each individual bear. We're 
concerned about the pain each bear endures from recreational hunters." NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Vaughan, husband and hunting guide for Marsha Vaughn, says people like 
Markarian rely on emotions rather than science. He calls them "nature fakers." 
He counters that starvation and territorial battles among males, both results 
of overpopulation, aren't very pleasant for the individual bear either. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have more bears now than 10 years ago. Definitely," Vaughan said. "When I 
first started walking these hills with my dad, all you'd see were tracks and 
scat. I can go out now and see three or four bears in daylight." 
</P>
<P>
 Anecdotal reports like Vaughan's are part of the reason the Department of Fish 
and Game decided to commission a study on the distribution of bear populations 
in several coastal counties from Los Angeles to Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Schultz, a researcher for the department, had volunteers place bait 
along 150 miles of trails and fire roads in the Ventura County backcountry. 
They were instructed to check the bait seven days later for signs of bear. 
Volunteers made note of the type of terrain and vegetation to determine what 
areas bears favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Vaughan was one of the volunteers. He set out a bait line of canned 
sardines along the Gridley Trail above Ojai. After punching holes in the can 
and spilling the oil to attract the attention of bears, Vaughan fastened the 
can to a tree with a wire durable enough to keep animals such as coyotes from 
disturbing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a bear hits this, you'll know it. They can destroy a rolled steel can as 
easy as an NFL lineman can shred an aluminum beer can." 
</P>
<P>
 And hit the bait they did. Preliminary results showed that of all the counties 
surveyed, Ventura had the highest percentage of bear visitations. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't tell Schultz how many bears are out there, but given what she 
estimates is the amount of land necessary to support a bear -- and that's not 
accounting for artificial food sources like avocados, which dramatically 
increase the amount of forage available -- there are well over 100 of them in 
the county. SUCCESS STORY 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their numbers, the success of Euarctos americanus has been 
remarkable, especially in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as the 1930s there were virtually no black bears in the southern 
portion of the state. But because their only natural predator, the grizzly or 
brown bear, has been extinct in California since 1922, the highly adaptive 
black bear has been free to expand its habitat, said Doug Updike, a bear 
researcher with Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Colonization started in 1933 when park rangers banished 27 troublesome black 
bears from Yosemite National Park to the San Gabriel and San Bernardino 
mountains. Since then they've spread to the extent that one biologist includes 
them with coyotes as one of the few examples of a large mammal that's thriving 
despite the impacts of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat is an important part of the equation. Whereas grizzlies preferred 
lightly forested foothills and grasslands -- the landscape favored for 
development -- black bears like mountainous terrain where nary a strip mall 
intrudes. 
</P>
<P>
 The other big reason for the black bear's success is a decrease in poaching, 
officials said. But recent arrests may point to an upswing in 
multimillion-dollar trade in bear parts, especially gallbladders. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hollywood businessman was fined $10,000 after prosecutors charged him in 
January with running an illegal hunting club to collect and sell the bear 
gallbladders, which they said could have been worth up to $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in late June a Rosemead man was arrested, culminating an 18-month 
investigation stretching across four states, after he allegedly bought 160 
gallbladders from undercover agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Ed Watkins of the Fish and Game special operations unit said it's the 
largest case he's seen during his nine-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this makes warden John Castro's discovery of the poached female at 
Lion's campground more disturbing, but Fish and Game officials are confident 
they have the matter in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The data strongly suggests that poaching is not a significant factor," Updike 
said. "The biggest issue is the habitat one. As long as habitat is preserved, 
our model for the next 10 years shows the population bouncing along with the 
carrying capacity of the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 That's just fine with Nodolf, who's out there looking for an even bigger bear 
than his 1990 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen tracks as big or bigger than the one I shot. My bear was only an 
8-year-old. His dad might still be out there." The American Black Bear 
</P>
<P>
 Size: 4.5 to 6 feet long and 2 to 3 feet high at the shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Weight: 200 to 400 pounds for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Coloring: Black to cinnamon brown, usually with a patch of white on chest. 
Face is always brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Range: In California, pine and hardwood forests and chaparral. 
</P>
<P>
 Food: Fruits, berries, acorns, grasses, roots, small mammals such as rodents, 
carrion, insects and even garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Habits: Solitary and territorial, with a shuffling walk and a stride about a 
foot long. Adult males occupy areas of about 20 square miles and often kill off 
young males that approach on their territory. Females mate in mid-July every 
other year and give birth to one or two cubs at a time. If forage conditions 
are poor, the bears cannot reproduce for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hibernation: Hibernates from mid-winter to early spring.

'Eating Machines' at Bay 
</P>
<P>
 Normally docile and easily frightened, black bears are becoming more 
aggressive in competing for food and territory, biologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to cancel your weekend hike in the backcountry, but if you're 
frying a pan of bacon in a bear's living room, be prepared for some uninvited 
ursine attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflicts usually peak from July through October, when bears are prone to eat 
just about anything to put on fat for the winter, said Glenn Stewart, a Cal 
Poly Pomona zoology professor who tracked Southern California bears from 1970 
through 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that during the summer, bears consume something like 20,000 calories a 
day. They are omnivorous eating machines, devouring grass, berries, acorns, 
avocados and the occasional picnic basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know what an ice chest looks like and they'll go right to it," said 
Morgan Boucke, a wildlife biologist with the California Department of Fish and 
Game in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 John Boggs, a recreation assistant at U.S. Forest Service's Ojai Ranger 
Station, said most contacts are in the Rose Valley and along Sespe Creek. 
Campers frying bacon at the Lion Campground, a mile east of Rose Valley at 
Sespe Creek, have had to chase off the bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Boucke said a few tips can prevent an unpleasant bear encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't make yourself smell too good. "Walking around bear country wearing 
suntan lotion that smells like a pina colada is probably not a good idea," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not cook and sleep in the same area. Do the cooking as much as 300 yards 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn to identify tracks and scat. If you see a lot of either, that's 
probably a bad place to cook dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always hang your food at least 10 feet off the ground and 10 feet away from 
the trunk of the tree. A rope strung between two trees works well. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you see a bear on the trail, don't run away. Wave your arms and make 
noise. It helps to carry some stones in your pocket to throw at the bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said young bears that are separating from their mothers and trying to 
find homes of their own are the ones most likely to come in contact with 
people. It was a young, 200-pound bear that mauled an Ojai boy last August as 
he slept at a camp at Barton Flats in the San Bernardino Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, with the bear incident, people were worried about them, so we had 
more bear reports," Boucke said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; BIG POOL OF TALENT IN WOMEN'S BILLIARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're hard-working, hard-training athletes, some making over $100,000 a year 
through promotional deals. Their competition is as intense as any professional 
sport. And they have one big advantage over football players when it comes to 
attracting the television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going out and sweating and getting messed up. Their dress can be 
perfect, and their hair can be perfect. They're a stunning group of women," 
said Shari Stauch, a professional pool player and executive editor of Pool and 
Billiard Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of the top competitors on the Women's Professional Billiard Assn.'s 1994 
tour are coming to Santa Monica on Friday to compete for $50,000 in prizes in 
the Gordon's 9-Ball Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The round-robin competition, which is free and open to the public, will begin 
at noon at Gotham Hall on the Third Street Promenade. The championship match is 
scheduled for 8:15 p.m. Saturday. The winner will leave with a $20,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's billiards is becoming an increasingly lucrative business, Stauch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting phenomenal," she said. "It came out of nowhere the last couple 
of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the top competitors, Stauch started playing pool because of a 
family connection. Her father ran Harold's Pool Parlor in Roselle, Ill. But as 
the prize purses and popularity of women's billiards has grown, the game has 
attracted a more diverse group of competitors, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers, nurses and businesswomen are now cuing up. One of the top competitors 
gave up a career as a computer engineer to join the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the image of the sport has changed, now you can walk into billiard clubs 
and there may be more women than men," Stauch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, men pool players still outnumber women, who constitute about 15 
million of the 40 million players in the United States, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And because there's a larger talent pool of male players, the top men's game 
is slightly above the women's, Stauch said. But as more women take up 
billiards, they're closing the gap, she said. And spectators originally drawn 
by the novelty of women's pool tournaments are sticking around nowadays solely 
for the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fantastic sport to watch," she said. JOHN BUZBEE

WORDS & IMAGES: CELEBRATED AUTHOR TO SIGN BOOKS IN VENTURA; HARRIET DOERR, 84, 
GAINED ACCLAIM FOR HER FIRST NOVEL, 'STONES FOR IBARRA.' NOW SHE'S WINNING 
PRAISE FOR 'CONSIDER THIS, SENORA.'

 If you are a published novelist, aspiring writer or merely a seeker of 
sparkling prose and good stories and enjoy meeting creators of literary art, 
pencil in Harriet Doerr. The 84-year-old author will appear at 4 p.m. Monday at 
the Oddfellows Hall, 522 E. Main St., Ventura, in an event sponsored by the 
Ventura Bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics and the public loved Doerr's first novel, "Stones for Ibarra," which 
was published in 1983 and became a bestseller and a television movie. Now, 10 
year later, her "Consider This, Senora" has been published to similar acclaim. 
Reviewers praise Doerr's new book as "wise, fresh as clean water, never 
sentimental or condescending." 
</P>
<P>
 Doerr is an inspiration to late bloomers. She left college to marry and raise 
a family and lived for many years in rural Mexico, the scene of both novels. 
Following her husband's death, she enrolled at Stanford University and received 
her bachelor's degree at age 67. She was 73 when the first novel was published 
and established herself not only as a fine writer, but also as an entertaining 
lecturer.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST HOLLYWOOD; PARK PLAN SACRIFICES LIBRARY, CRITICS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS

<TEXT>
<P>
 West Hollywood Park has a basketball court, a swimming pool and a softball 
field, among other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 But given the debate over the proposed $5-million renovation of the five-acre 
park, a boxing ring might be suitable too. 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood officials say the 30-year-old San Vicente Boulevard park just 
north of Melrose Avenue is decrepit and poorly designed. At a public hearing 
earlier this week, a consulting firm hired by the city recommended enlarging 
the ball field, upgrading the pool area and moving the West Hollywood library 
to an undetermined site. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will consider the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city officials and residents have already begun to raise concerns 
that the plan would be costly, would cut down on open space and would leave the 
library in limbo because it does not specify where it would go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm opposed to this (project) the way it's set up right now," Councilman 
Steve Martin said in an interview. "We could make tremendous improvements to 
the existing facilities at a fraction of the cost cited in the plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Abbe Land said in an interview, "I'd like to see some changes -- to see 
if there's a way to redesign some areas to have more open, green space." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed renovation "is obviously a vast improvement over what exists 
now," resident Martin Strudler said at the hearing. "There's just two things 
missing: a library and a park." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Roslyn Krause said that the city has neglected the park for many 
years and has drafted an unworkable plan. "Now (the city) wants to take it and 
turn it into a sports center," she said. "We want a park, with green space and 
picnic grounds. We don't want a sports center." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and others questioned whether the city could afford the proposed 
renovation. The consultants' report suggested myriad funding sources, including 
taxes, grants and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city spends money like they've got it, but they don't," resident Jeff 
Prang said. "They're dreaming of a Mercedes project on a Chevy income." SCOTT

ROCKTALK; CLUB OWNERS SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO FILL WEEK; AN ACOUSTIC SONGWRITER'S 
SHOWCASE AT NICHOLBY'S IS THE LATEST ATTEMPT AT ATTRACTING AN AUDIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If the week was only two days long, club owners would be relieved of trying to 
figure out what to do the other five days. If they have even the slightest 
clue, they can usually make their rent off the Friday and Saturday night 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, it's time to get creative. A lot of times the answer ends up being 
blues, reggae or even the dreaded karaoke -- stuff that won't work on Friday or 
Saturday. DJs, drink specials, piano bars, country dance night, "Monday Night 
Football," wet T-shirt night, cheap happy hour food -- the search goes on and 
on. Nothing seems to last too long. In Ventura, the same six or eight bands 
seem to play every weekend while the other hundred bands don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough call on the weeknights," said Nick Taylor of Nicholby's in 
Ventura, rapidly becoming a happening venue. "You keep trying to find something 
that will work. We seem to have been pretty lucky with the Blue Monday shows. 
But other than that, it's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Next victim to the Altar of Eternal Optimism will be an Acoustic Songwriter's 
Showcase tonight at Nicholby's. Promoter Jimmy Adams, a folk singer who also 
plays with the Fender Benders, hopes to do a showcase a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it'll probably be 90% original music," said Adams, "but we won't say 
anything if someone plays a cover song. I was going to do this before, and we 
had Chris Hillman all set to play, but something came up. We've been a little 
less ambitious this time, but we're going to have Roy and Daphne Jones from 
House of Games, some members of Babylon Sister, plus some of my friends, Steve 
Baker and Mary Wilson. Murray Bowes is going to bring some of his friends. I 
think it might be pretty good; there's flyers all over town, and there's no 
cover charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, how about Free Beer Night? That'd work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While in the Vacillating Venue Department: If you're one of the few people in 
the '90s for whom the Lion I's song, "I'm So Poor" is not your theme song, then 
walk, don't run, to the nearest telephone and call 969-5768. You could rent or 
lease the old Midnight Hour building on West Main in Ventura. It's newly 
repainted and stands emptier than my old girlfriend's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road apiece, just across from Burger King, is the future home of Two 
West on Main Street at Ventura Avenue. Long thought to be the next pile of 
rubble after any magnitude earthquake, the brick building has been reinforced 
and, hopefully by mid-September, will be the new and happening rock 'n' roll 
venue. To blame are relocated El Alien photographer Dave Paglia and his 
girlfriend Martha Davis, who used to front those New Wave faves, the Motels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The place is going to be wonderful," said Davis. "Right now, we're doing the 
permit thing with the city. We're looking at a juice and sandwich bar, coffee 
shop and art gallery." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and three others -- one of which is Erik Lemaire of Aerial -- have an 
as-yet-unnamed band that will probably play the opening of the venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Further down the road apiece, the local rock night at Metro Bay Club on 
Wednesdays has been replaced by DJs. Two blocks farther south, Lipstix, once 
the Bermuda Triangle, has either gone or discovered a unique marketing strategy 
by staying closed on Friday nights. The phone has been disconnected, never a 
good sign. Lipstix had occasional live performances on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be no Farmer John or Easter Bunny but there is an Eric in Eric 
Ericsson's in Ventura, the place on the beach that rocks on weekends. Eric 
Wachter is also going to run the pier restaurant and the old Charlie's site, 
which will become Pineapples, a restaurant that will rock about as much as your 
granny's house. The opening for Pineapples will be March, '95. And the pier 
restaurant will open in summer of '95. Look for the Tijuana Hound Dogs, 
acoustic music by Chris Byrd and Frank Barajas, to play at the pier venue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the good ol' days at Charlie's on Mondays? First Matt & Bill would 
make people forget how to spell Everly Brothers with their soaring harmonies 
during happy hour. Then either Durango 95 or Michael On Fire would play in the 
evening. MOF, relocated to Nashville, has for the last few years been on that 
endless road trip but will be heading back to California soon for some L.A. 
gigs. The one that matters to us: Aug. 26 at Underground in Santa Barbara. 
"Venus In The Daytime" is MOF's third CD. Michael has doubled the size of the 
band to six, adding another drummer, a bass player and a sax player. He even 
finally recorded one of his show stoppers as well: "I Think I Came Too Late To 
The Party." Call 1-800-626-4304 for a CD. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Don't you just hate it when some rock star gives you the ol' "Howzit goin' 
Venchura" routine and asks you to clap your hands? Anyway, Harry Connick Jr. 
did tell me to clap my hands, and of course, I ignored him. He otherwise seemed 
genuinely on a roll the other night at the Santa Barbara County Bowl, 
dispensing with the Usual Cliche Festival. His funniest line had to do with a 
dead girlfriend song, "St. James Infirmary," a tune you probably won't hear 
while you're on hold with Blue Cross. Right at the quietest, saddest point of 
the song, three women in the back somewhere screamed in unison, "We love you, 
Harry." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not now, baby, I'm dyin' " said Connick without missing a lick.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; CITY VOTES TO DELAY PUTTING SAFETY INITIATIVE ON 
BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday refused to place a public safety and homeless 
services initiative before voters this fall, even though the measure had 
qualified for the ballot. Instead, the council voted to exercise its legal 
option to study the measure over the next 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 By effectively tabling the matter, the council majority avoided having a 
politically sensitive measure decided in the same election in which three 
council seats are up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 4 to 2, with Councilmen Robert T. Holbrook, a supporter of the 
initiative, and Kelly Olsen voting to place the matter on the Nov. 8 ballot. 
Both Holbrook and Olsen's seats are up for election this fall. Tony Vazquez, 
the third incumbent facing reelection, voted against a November vote on the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have faith in the residents of this community," Olsen said during Tuesday's 
council meeting. "I'm not afraid of having voters make a decision on this in 
November." 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure placement on the November ballot, petitions had to be turned in by 
early July, which would have left enough time for 30 days of study. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the council decision denied Holbrook and others the opportunity to run 
on a ballot with a public safety initiative, it also gave them an issue -- that 
the council majority thwarted the will of some 12,000 residents who signed 
petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do not want us to have a right to vote on aggressive panhandling, park 
closure and meaningful policies on how to address homeless (issues)," Holbrook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Paul Rosenstein said the timing of the initiative campaign was 
aimed at using the homeless issue for political advantage. "We are taking this 
great social tragedy . . . and turning it into an election campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, called the Public Safety and Homeless Services Act of 1994, 
calls for, among other things, stricter laws on panhandling and tighter fiscal 
controls on spending for social services. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure qualified for the ballot with an estimated 6,900 valid signatures, 
according to random sampling conducted by the county Registrar-Recorder's 
office. That was about 1,500 more than the 5,394 the petition needed to win a 
place on a general election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal failed to reach a higher threshold of 8,091 signatures -- 15% 
of registered voters -- needed to trigger a special election. Some signatures 
were invalidated because two of the petition circulators got their voter 
registration information to election officials one day late. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of the petition drive said they will consider going to court to 
ask to have their signatures deemed valid, despite the problem with the 
circulators.

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; A MAN OF STEEL; DAVID ALTMAN RISES ABOVE HIS 
DEBILITATING, LIFELONG 'TIN MAN'S' DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Altman is a young man in motion. And that's the story -- a miracle 
actually. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, 23, was never expected to walk again, much less pace the floor as he 
did recently, talking about his return from the brink of oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
 He was never expected to gesture with his gnarled hands, jabbing them in the 
air as if he were a conductor gearing up for a crescendo. Or to graduate from 
UCLA this spring with a 3.85 grade point average. Or to get a perfect score on 
the law school admissions test, winning a spot at UCLA School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
 As a boy of 10, Altman developed a very bad case of a rare disease -- 
dermatomyositis, an inflammation of the skin and muscles that is debilitating, 
and sometimes fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Altman's case, the disease was for years a living death. His body produced 
huge sheets of rock-hard calcium, literally entombing him in a self-made body 
cast.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had my own personal body armor," Altman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the calcium would melt on its own, causing painful abscesses that 
required surgery -- dozens of surgeries. Sometimes doctors tried to remove 
pieces of it, including a 4 1/2-inch-thick chunk that was embedded in Altman's 
backside. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the stiffness he will have to battle all of his days, health care 
workers have dubbed his ailment Tin Man's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "He, indeed, looks like the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz," says Dr. Bram 
Bernstein, who is David Altman's doctor and heads the rheumatology department 
at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath Altman's inflexible exterior, however, lies a hero's heart and a 
champion's will, say those who know him. And his story offers a formidable 
lesson in the power of mind over matter. 
</P>
<P>
 He "is a walking tribute to the human spirit," UCLA Economics Professor Earl 
A. Thompson wrote in a recommendation for his former student. "He possesses a 
truly astounding combination of intellectual ability and sheer physical 
courage." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Odessa, in the former Soviet Union, Altman arrived in the United 
States with his parents, Raisa and Jack, when he was 4. The family lived in 
Detroit, but moved to California in 1979 after a vacation there the year 
before. They eventually settled in Santa Monica, where they still live. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman says he remembers vividly the onset of his illness, how the simple 
chore of sweeping leaves in the back yard gradually became harder -- and 
finally impossible. His muscles seemed to desert him; he was always tired. 
</P>
<P>
 A rash on his hands and face plus a high fever led to a misdiagnosis of the 
disease as lupus, a related but distinctly different ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 It took two years, and the persistence of Altman's indomitable mother, to 
obtain the correct diagnosis at Childrens Hospital's internationally known 
rheumatology department. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are no statistics on the number of juvenile cases of 
dermatomyositis, Bernstein said he sees one case of it for every 20 cases he 
sees of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis -- itself a rare condition afflicting 
100,000 children nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average pediatrician has probably never seen a case," Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor said dermatomyositis is an autoimmune disorder that is possibly 
caused by a virus. It is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, such as 
cortisone, and immunosuppressant drugs, like those used to fight cancer. The 
disease causes painful inflammation of the skin and muscles, especially at the 
major joints -- hips, shoulders, elbows, knees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In some children (adults get the disorder, too), internal muscles are 
affected, deteriorating to the point that patients can't breathe or their 
intestines perforate, causing death. 
</P>
<P>
 David Altman's disease took the other common course for children when he 
developed calcinosis. As a complication of dermatomyositis, the body's calcium 
production mechanism can run amok, laying rock-hard deposits under the skin and 
sometimes in the muscle tissue itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Touch Altman's arm where there is a calcium deposit, and it feels like he has 
a steel plate embedded there. That was how it felt to Altman, too, who for 
several years in the '80s could not walk, sit or even at times feed himself. 
"He couldn't open his mouth to put in a teaspoon," said his mother, an 
accountant who gave up her job to care for her son. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Altman was depressed and irritable. During those periods 
when he was not hospitalized, he lay on a gurney in the darkened living room of 
his Santa Monica home, wanting no light, no television, no food, no human 
contact. Every 15 minutes, he had to be repositioned because of the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like being crunched between two pieces of calcium," Altman said. 
</P>
<P>
 During months of hospitalization, Altman says he was a "beast patient," 
lashing out at nurses, who drew straws to see who would have to care for him. 
"I was a jerk; I really was," Altman says. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, he had cause. At times, Altman's body was covered with sores that for 
Bernstein brought to mind a parable from the Book of Job, in which Satan tested 
Job's faith by covering his body with boils "from the sole of his foot unto his 
crown." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's broken spirit and body only made Raisa Altman more determined. Jeri 
Trabin, a hospital social worker who has worked with the family for nine years, 
said Raisa was always unyielding where her son's treatment was concerned, 
eventually persuading the state's medical bureaucracies to provide care they 
didn't normally approve. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wasn't about to accept things as they were," Trabin said. "Anything that 
would increase his chances she would make sure it would happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman did still have full use of his brain, and he started exercising it by 
reading a Sidney Sheldon book his mother had brought to the hospital in one of 
many attempts to re-engage her son. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading became his salvation, but if it brought the world to his bedside, it 
also made Altman want to rejoin that world. The '80s may be called the decade 
of greed now, but the economic barons who were the best at what they did 
captured the imagination of the bed-bound teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a kid reading the Wall Street Journal and writing (letters to) Malcolm 
Forbes," said Altman, who was later invited to New York to meet his hero. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, Altman had graduated from the gurney to a special, vertical 
wheelchair for those who cannot bend at the waist. He had also ceased to become 
a pain in the neck to his care-givers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his reputation lingered. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabin said the legend of Altman and his persistent mother spread to other 
hospitals, which didn't want to take him as a patient. Yet, Trabin said, she 
always saw that what made him a demanding patient could be turned around to 
work on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always saw something bright and shining about him," Trabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease stopped progressing in 1986; no more calcium deposits grew, but 
plenty remained. "Since then, I've been trying to roll back all the things that 
went wrong," Altman said. 
</P>
<P>
 That, among other things, meant "casting," a seemingly primitive, but 
effective, way to increase range of motion. In Altman's case, curled-up legs 
and arms were stretched to the point of torture, then put in a cast. The 
process is repeated until, inch by inch, range of motion is increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like trying to stretch a rock," Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the casting, accompanied by exhausting work by Altman, paid off. 
He recalls using a walker. It took an hour to inch painfully across the family 
living room. Afterward, Altman said, he was so drenched with sweat, he looked 
like he had just gotten out of the shower. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did he put himself through this regimen? "I did it for my parents," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, during his senior year, Altman was able to attend Santa Monica High 
full time. Though he needed a boost to get out of his wheelchair, Altman, using 
crutches, made it across the stage to pick up his diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, Altman said he was so excited to be there, he threw the crutches away 
in three months. To say that he blossomed at the Westwood campus is an 
understatement.  
</P>
<P>
 "Students tend to flock to him, drawn by his wonderful sense of humor, his dry 
wit and his exceptional knowledge and intellect," said history Professor Mary 
Yeager in a recommendation. "I observed his intellectual and personal 
generosity toward others many times." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though Altman's intellectual and social life soared, his body still betrayed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing Altman's condition, Thompson, the economic professor, wrote in his 
recommendation: "I have never seen a student attend lectures with physical 
ailments so bad that he could neither sit down, stand straight nor lean up 
against a support; that he could neither write nor hold his note pad straight 
or steady; that he could scarcely move without a wince from the pain."  
</P>
<P>
 The pain was from abscesses that formed when some of the calcium deposits 
liquefied. Surgeries provided the only relief, but Altman insisted on 
postponing them, refusing to miss a test, after missing years of classes during 
his junior high years.  
</P>
<P>
 His mother said that often, she would pick him up after an exam and take him 
straight to the hospital for an operation. Despite all that, Altman made it 
through college in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Altman is working part time at the John E. Anderson Graduate 
School of Management Library while waiting for law school to begin. He expects 
to return to Childrens Hospital this month for yet another surgery aimed at 
improving mobility in his elbow joints. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman's professional goal is to be the "J.P. Morgan of the super-information 
highway." His personal goal is to work toward independent living, though his 
frozen back, locked shoulders and hips continue to preclude him from that -- at 
least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Altman are betting on him -- even to overcome the one academic 
goal that has eluded him -- entrance to Stanford University Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he was 15, Altman has been telling everyone at the hospital that he was 
going to Stanford. To his perhaps naive astonishment, the law school did not 
admit him; despite his perfect score on the entrance exam, he was placed on the 
waiting list.  
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on Altman's reaction to earlier setbacks, Trabin said: "If there 
was anything else like that (rejection), it would mean absolutely nothing to 
him or his mother," Trabin said. "They would just go on. Stanford may never 
hear the end of it."

THEATER REVIEW; ACCESSIBLE TRAGEDY IN OJAI STAGING OF 'OTHELLO'; SHAKESPEARE'S 
STORY REMAINS TIMELESS. THE THREE-HOUR PERFORMANCE AT LIBBEY PARK MOVES 
QUICKLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many audiences, "Othello" may be Shakespeare's most accessible tragedy: 
The characters and motivation are simply and clearly delineated, and the 
situations are timeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai Shakespeare Festival's production of the play concludes this weekend 
at beautiful, warm Libbey Park. The show is long -- over three hours -- but 
moves quickly, and few observers are likely to accuse director Paul Backer of 
providing a boring evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Othello, general of the Duke of Venice's army, has appointed young Cassio his 
lieutenant, passing over the ambitious Iago. Furious at the slight, Iago plots 
against Othello, first taking advantage of racial prejudice (Othello is black; 
his wife, Desdemona, white). He then manipulates people to believe that 
Desdemona is carrying on an affair with Cassio. Enraged by jealousy, Othello 
retaliates. 
</P>
<P>
 Some present-day parallels can be drawn, chiefly regarding the dangers of 
hasty judgment that's based on innuendo, false leaks, circumstantial and forged 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the tragedy is Othello's, the play might well have been named "Iago," 
after the scheming central figure. Trusted by virtually everyone, he sets 
former friends against one another and is eventually responsible for several 
deaths; only in the final scene is his treachery revealed to the others, and by 
then his damage has been incontrovertibly wrought. 
</P>
<P>
 He's such a thoroughly rotten character that Iago is easy to overplay into a 
mustache-twirling villain. To his own and director Backer's great credit, 
Vincent Wares underplays the role somewhat, leading the audience to accept that 
the other characters could believe the man's lie upon lie. Another positive 
aspect of toning down Iago a bit is that it allows a richer portrayal of 
Othello, who can look like a buffoon if he seems to be too easily fooled. That 
role, the buffoon, goes to the vain, somewhat effete Roderigo, played with 
great comic effect by Cecil Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
 Other main characters include virtuous Desdemona, nicely played by Brenda 
Kenworthy; Iago's easily misled wife, Emilia, portrayed by Jill Macy (who rises 
to full strength in the final act); and the reliable James Leslie as Cassio. 
</P>
<P>
 Shriff Hasan, an actor imported from Alabama for the occasion, gives his 
portrayal of Othello a naturalistic, rather modern interpretation that works 
well in this production. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is the show played well, it looks good, thanks in no small part to 
the lovely single set designed by Jeff G. Rack, who has worked on previous 
festival and Santa Paula Theater Center productions. The luxurious costumes 
were designed and coordinated by Lisa Foley. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday and Sunday afternoons, the festival presents a program called 
"Renaissance Farce." Directed by Backer and Terry Donovan-Smith, it's a series 
of sketches, most of them from Renaissance-era European sources (though one's 
from Japan), in the commedia dell'arte tradition -- which here means lots of 
physical comedy, punning repartee, topical references and other assorted 
merriment. The highlight, a burlesque of "Othello," is buried in the middle of 
the two-hour show, which ends rather anticlimactically with a "nose contest," 
in which the players boast of the length of their proboscises. Better the two 
skits should be reversed in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble cast includes Frankie Cohen, Geoff Foley, Richard Goad, Jill 
Greenwood, Wendy Maroney, Chris Palmquist, Zoe Pietrycha, Rachel Pratt, Mark 
Thomas, Benjamin Wallace, Elizabeth Wallace and Deborah Wolk. 
</P>
<P>
 Various permutations of the festival's resident Measure for Measure Minstrels 
contribute musical interludes before and during both shows, under the 
leadership of Jaye Hersh. Details

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; CHAPLIN GIVES OLIVAS ADOBE THE SILENT TREATMENT; 
THE ANNUAL CINEMA NIGHT FEATURES THE COMEDY LEGEND'S DEBUT MOVIE, 'TILLIE'S 
PUNCTURED ROMANCE,' WHICH ALSO INTRODUCED THE KEYSTONE KOPS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Charlie Chaplin classic "Tillie's Punctured Romance" is the centerpiece 
for this year's silent film night at the Olivas Adobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack Sennett directed the 1914 film -- Chaplin's first feature-length comedy. 
It's also the silent film that planted the Keystone Kops into the American 
vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Senate, historian at the Olivas Adobe, said there was a silent film 
actually shot at the historic building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it was called 'The Gringo Strikes' and was filmed around 1911," 
Senate said. "That film is still lost, but I did find one at the Library of 
Congress that was shot in Santa Paula by the same company." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate said that the $500 cost for obtaining a copy from the Library of 
Congress means the film is unlikely to appear at the adobe unless someone comes 
up with the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the feature, several comedy shorts will be screened and KVEN's morning 
team of Dave and Bob will test the audience's knowledge of movie trivia. 
Tickets are $3 for adults and are available at Ventura City Hall and the Olivas 
Adobe, 420 Olivas Park Drive. For more information call 658-4728.

<P>
 Is there a doctor in the house? 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently there wasn't on the set of "The Client." The legal thriller based on 
John Grisham's novel had a scene in which an ambulance-chasing lawyer was 
soliciting an accident victim seated in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 The patient, recounting his injuries, lists various cuts and contusions 
concluding with a broken collar bone. When the ambulance chaser expresses 
delight that the broken clavicle could mean several thousand dollars in 
additional damages, the patient becomes disgusted and, using the supposedly 
injured shoulder, briskly wheels himself out of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Highly unlikely," said John Hill, an orthopedic surgeon in Ventura. "People 
have lots of difficulty moving the arm on the involved side. I can't imagine 
someone being able to use a wheelchair." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodstock juggernaut rolls on. 
</P>
<P>
 Salzer's Video is offering a recut version of the Academy Award-winning 
documentary on the Aquarian festival. The new cut includes 30 minutes of 
previously unseen performances, including those of Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson 
Airplane and Canned Heat. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the film has been remixed, remastered and restored, all to take 
advantage of Woodstock's 25th anniversary hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like nostalgia," said Salzer, who was heavily involved in the late '60s 
music scene. "The thing I find interesting is nostalgia seems to be less about 
how things were and more about how they should have been."

CIVIC CENTER: A MISLEADING DISPUTE OVER HEIGHT LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laurel Roennau's recent letter to The Times (Westside section, Aug. 4) 
presents an inaccurate view of council member Kelly Olsen's actions regarding 
the Civic Center. She bases her conclusions on an assertion that he presented a 
motion to the City Council which ultimately permitted increased maximum heights 
in the proposed RAND developments on Ocean Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Olsen's motion did not raise the maximum permitted heights as 
stated in the Specific Plan by 14 feet, as Ms. Roennau claims. In fact, council 
member Olsen's motion lowered the maximum permitted heights by 14 feet, or one 
full story. 
</P>
<P>
 We are the entire membership of the Civic Center working group, which was 
appointed by the City Council. Our mission was to facilitate a process to reach 
a community consensus on the urban design plan for the Civic Center. We 
recognize Ms. Roennau's right to her opinion of council member Olsen. However, 
her facts are incorrect.

VENICE: CONTROLLING VENDORS ON BOARDWALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The immense popularity of the Venice Boardwalk has raised new concerns for 
this zany seaside carnival. The huge crowds have attracted every manner of 
illegal vendor and legitimate nonprofit to set up shop on Ocean Front 
Walk.This, in turn, has created an impenetrable wall of tables along the east 
side of the famous walkway, blocking emergency vehicle access and posing a 
safety hazard for pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Limiting nonprofit groups to six-foot tables and banning structures along the 
boardwalk's west side is a reasonable means to restore public ingress and 
egress and to preserve some open space in this public park. Of course, 
leafleting, signature gathering and other free speech activities will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice Boardwalk Assn. respects and welcomes the many artists, 
craftspeople and entertainers working on the boardwalk; at our request, the new 
boardwalk regulations do not affect these individuals. However, we feel they 
deserve to have their contributions recognized, so last December we proposed a 
plan to legitimize their presence on the boardwalk. We also asked (that) they 
be allowed to sell their wares. (They are currently prohibited from setting a 
price and can only suggest a donation.) 
</P>
<P>
 We look forward to the city of Los Angeles going ahead with this plan to 
establish the west side of the boardwalk as a permanent haven for the 
activities of artists and entertainers.

NOISE: BUTTERFLIES AND USE OF NATURE PRESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Notwithstanding Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's shrieks to the contrary, I 
applaud the people who are using the land west of LAX for something more useful 
than making a few bureaucrats and pseudo-scientists feel noble ("Joy Riders 
Threaten Delicate El Segundo Nature Preserve," July 31). We have a few thousand 
butterflies that are alleged to be incapable of living elsewhere so the area is 
closed off to the public in the people's name (count me out, please). Perhaps 
we should be happy that some environmentalists and their willing agents in 
government (e.g., Galanter) haven't "discovered" that noise upsets their 
beloved, sacred butterflies, for then we'd have no other recourse but to close 
LAX and build a new airport at a less "environmentally sensitive" area.

PARKS: TRIAL PERIOD FOR OFF-LEASH DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the course of the six-month off-leash trial period for dogs in two Santa 
Monica parks, neighbors adjacent to Joslyn Park documented and reported more 
than 200 violations of the city ordinance.We also voiced concern over conflicts 
with county health and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than simply complain, we have made specific observations and 
suggestions. The most important of these is for Santa Monica to open within the 
next six months a dedicated site in a non-residential area which does not 
deprive city residents of any existing park space and allows for extensive use 
by off-leash dogs.

OUT AND ABOUT / HISTORIC HOLLYWOOD: STROLL ON THE STRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood had a lot of glitz, not to mention a plethora of stars and film 
studios, during its heyday in the 1920s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
 Some years later, however, Hollywood's image began to fade as crime and blight 
marred the area, chasing away the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But, seeking to ensure the old Hollywood is not forgotten, the restoration 
group Hollywood Heritage Inc. offers monthly walking tours of the community and 
its historic landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tours give people a (sense of) past history," said Sally McKibbin, 
coordinator of the docent-led tours focusing on Hollywood and Sunset 
boulevards. "People walk away and say, 'I never knew that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunset Strip tour, created by author and Hollywood Heritage docent Laurie 
Jacobson, emphasizes the more notorious night life of the area. It focuses on 
the glamour and gossip associated with a 1.7-mile stretch of Sunset Boulevard 
in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour includes a stop of the site of legendary celebrity hangout Schwab's 
Drug Store and a number of other hot spots where stars partied and fell in 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 Docents also talk about the sites of celebrated scandals from the old days, 
including Cafe Trocadero, a trendy nightclub that was the last place some of 
actress Thelma Todd's friends saw her alive. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Hollywood Boulevard tour focuses on the architectural history 
of the area. The first stop is the Pantages Theater, site of the Academy Awards 
ceremony during the 1950s. Thought to be the first Art Deco theater built in 
the United States, it was intended to be a skyscraper until the crash of the 
stock market made funding scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 Docents highlight various other landmarks, including the Hollywood Roosevelt 
Hotel, Mann's Chinese Theatre, Capitol Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours are two hours and are given alternatively on the second Sunday of each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Said McKibbin: "It breaks my heart to see what has happened to Hollywood . . . 
preservation of the buildings and history of Hollywood is so important." 
</P>
<P>
 The next Sunset Strip tour is Sunday at noon. Meet at the Laugh Factory, 8001 
Hollywood Blvd. The next Hollywood Boulevard tour is Sept. 11. Cost is $6. 
Information: (213) 874-4005.

NOTEBOOK / MITCH POLIN; SEASON IS FIVE WEEKS OFF, BUT CORSAIRS ALREADY COUNTING 
THEIR LOSSES 
</P>

<P>
 The Santa Monica College football team, expected to have one of the best 
offenses in the Western State Conference, has lost its top two receivers 
because of academic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Clark and Kory Jones, who as freshman combined for 62 receptions, 1,040 
yards and 10 touchdowns, have been ruled academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a sore subject," first-year Corsair Coach Robert Taylor said. 
"It hurts me to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said the players could rejoin the team in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could go anywhere in 1995 if they're OK academically, but hopefully 
they'll choose to come here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Clark and Jones should give three freshmen an opportunity to 
start: Nakia Wheeler from Carson High; Lane Wells from University High and Bo 
Parks from Hawaii. Parks is the son of former Dallas Cowboys receiver Billy 
Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica, 3-6-1 in 1993, begins practice Aug. 18. The Corsairs will travel 
to Orange Coast College for a scrimmage Sept. 2 and open against Rio Hondo 
College on Sept. 17.

EARTHWATCH: FIGHTING FIRE DANGER BEFORE THE FLAMES BEGIN; SURROUNDING HOMES 
WITH THE RIGHT PLANTS IN THE RIGHT PLACES CAN HELP PREVENT LOSSES IN THE EVENT 
OF A BLAZE.

 At this time of year -- and for the rest of the year -- there will probably be 
a wildfire burning somewhere in California. Frequently, our county is involved. 
Despite the constant threat of fire, people who live in at-risk areas seldom 
think about doing anything to protect their houses -- until it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The most effective defense, according to the Ventura County Fire Protection 
District, has less to do with hoses and fire extinguishers than with the way 
people have landscaped their property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have built our homes on the most flammable place on Earth," observed Owen 
Dell, a Santa Barbara landscape designer who is a pioneer in the emerging 
profession of "firescaping," the fire department-recommended practice of 
clearing away the brush within 30 to 100 feet of your house and replacing it 
with fire-resistant, low-lying plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Firefighters are extremely good at what they do, but they can only do so 
much," Dell said. "If you've put in the wrong kind of landscaping, they can't 
help you." 
</P>
<P>
 This "defensible space," as firefighters call it, can improve the odds your 
house won't catch fire if there's a conflagration in your neighborhood. The 
California state fire marshal and local fire officials can't agree on these 
odds -- but the range is 50% to 90% in your favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have to mean your house looks like a bunker in a cleared field," 
Dell said. "It's not so much the species of plants but their arrangement. High 
trees overhanging the roof, close-in bushes and badly maintained growth are the 
most dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 One client, Venturan Joanna Ho, decided to commission a fire retardant 
landscape design for her property after a neighbor installed one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked good. We had let our hillside go (without maintenance) and we 
wanted to prevent a fire hazard," Ho said. Her neighbor referred her to the 
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, which told her about Dell. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks at the garden also recommended a visit to the Firescape 
Demonstration Garden nearby at Santa Barbara Fire Station No. 7. It's the only 
such public demonstration in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 When Earthwatch took a tour guided by Dell, who designed the spread, a Simi 
Valley family was also there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's neat!" enthused Mark Killian, who knows he lives in a fire-hazard zone 
and wanted to know what to do to protect his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Lists of fire-retardant plants, which emphasize those that are 
drought-tolerant and native to California, and plans for arranging the plants 
are free to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration gets high praise from other landscaping professionals. 
Thousand Oaks landscape architect John K. Innis calls it "absolutely the best" 
example of fire-retardant landscaping "and it's also a very nice garden -- 
which it has to be or people would just say 'phooey' to the whole idea." 
</P>
<P>
 What you see there is dwarf coyote bush, Algerian ivy, rockrose, ice plant, 
creeping daisies, toyon, laurel, pepper trees and oleander. Dell has a photo 
collection of houses impacted by wildfire -- one in particular appears quite 
clearly to have been spared because of oleander planted nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Ventura County, the fire departments serving the county and the cities 
of Ventura and Oxnard will provide planting recommendations and a Homeowner's 
Landscape Fire Safety Checklist. Local nurseries, particularly Katsuda Nursery 
and Green Thumb, stock many of these species. Details 
</P>

Department, Kathy Taylor-Gauthier, at 654-7790; Ventura County Fire Protection 
District, Sandy Wells, 389-9710, or the Somis office of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture Soil Conservation District, Sheri Kittich, 386-4489. Also visit the 
Firescape Demonstration Gardens at Santa Barbara Fire Station No. 7, 564-5702.

SPORTS; MELENDEZ CAN ONLY WATCH, WAIT AND WISH; BASEBALL: PAST SEASON AND A 
HALF HAVE BROUGHT NOTHING BUT BAD LUCK FOR FIRST BASEMAN, WHO REMAINS HOPEFUL 
OF RESURRECTING HIS PROFESSIONAL CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It wasn't supposed to be like this. The summer of 1994 should have found Dan 
Melendez playing first base in the Dodgers' minor league system, honing his 
skills as the projected heir apparent to Eric Karros. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so Melendez thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the former St. Bernard High and Pepperdine standout has been 
working out at the Culver City Babe Ruth field in an attempt to recapture his 
skills and block out the frustration of another baseball season dashed by an 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Elbow surgery wiped out the current campaign. Last year, a wrist injury kept 
him off the field for the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Melendez, 23, tries to maintain a positive outlook. He points out that he is 
young and strong enough, both physically and mentally, to regain his form. But 
the fact that he hasn't played in a regular-season game for more than a year is 
a sobering slap in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightmare, actually," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second-round draft pick in 1992, Melendez signed with the Dodgers for 
$160,000 after helping Pepperdine win its first national championship in 
baseball. He bypassed the rookie league and spent his first pro season at 
Bakersfield playing for the Dodgers' Class-A team. He was promoted to the 
double-A team in San Antonio in 1993 and got off to a strong start, ranking 
among team leaders in home runs and runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything, it seemed, pointed to Melendez fulfilling the promise he had 
displayed at St. Bernard, where he set 14 school hitting and pitching records 
and was named The Times' 1989 South Bay Player of the Year. He was drafted in 
the seventh round by the Baltimore Orioles out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on a fast pace," Melendez said. "It was almost too good." 
</P>
<P>
 Too good, indeed. His steady climb up the Dodgers' ladder came to an abrupt 
halt in June, 1993, when he suffered a sprained wrist diving for a ball. With 
that, Melendez's luck went south. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to spring training in good shape, but another freak injury would 
soon take him out of the lineup, a situation he wasn't used to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up I was never injured," he said. "I don't think I ever missed a 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Yarnall, who coached Melendez for four years at St. Bernard, said: "He was 
a true iron man in high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the 6-foot-4 Melendez is trying to avoid the "injury-prone" tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just been through some hard times so far," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange days may be a more accurate description of his most recent injury. 
After all, it isn't often that a first baseman undergoes a surgical procedure 
usually performed on arm-weary pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird," Melendez said. "A lot of pitchers have it done, but I had to do 
it on my non-throwing arm." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be the right arm, the one Melendez extended across the base line 
trying to catch a wide throw from second baseman Chris Demetral in a spring 
training game against the Montreal Expos last April in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the (runner) would veer off, but he came straight through the bag," 
Melendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The force of the collision snapped the medial collateral ligament in 
Melendez's right elbow. Dr. Frank Jobe, the well-known sports orthopedist, 
performed the surgery in which Melendez's elbow ligament was replaced by a 
tendon taken from his right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (wrist) tendon is not essential, but I had to rehab it," Melendez said. 
"The wrist is fine. The elbow will tighten up. I have to ice it and stretch it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, though, Melendez has made encouraging progress. He is 
ahead of schedule in his recovery and plans to participate next month in an 
instructional league in Scottsdale, Ariz. After that, he plans to play winter 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The therapy has gone well," he said. "I've been getting stronger with 
weightlifting." 
</P>
<P>
 Melendez, who weighs 205 pounds (about 15 pounds more than he did at 
Pepperdine), knows he needs more than increased strength to regain his form on 
the baseball field. That's why he is regularly working out with friends near 
his parents' home in West Los Angeles, where he still lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But he knows that taking batting practice and fielding ground balls can only 
do so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to play games," he said. "(The layoff) has hurt me, just in terms of 
playing experience. Not having seen pitching in a while, it will take time to 
get back to normal. And just everyday decision-making. You never forget it, but 
you get rusty." 
</P>
<P>
 Yarnall, the St. Bernard coach, says if anyone can overcome back-to-back 
injuries, it's Melendez. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real frustrating simply because he was one of those can't-miss prospects 
as far as hitting goes," Yarnall said. "To have two freak-type accidents happen 
to him two years in a row is heartbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "But knowing the type of person Danny is, his work ethic and determination, I 
don't think he'll have a problem coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Yarnall rates Melendez and Royce Clayton, now the starting shortstop for the 
San Francisco Giants, as the best players he has coached. Clayton graduated 
from St. Bernard in 1988, a year before Melendez, and the two players remain 
close. During his layoff, Melendez visited Clayton in San Francisco and took in 
some Giants games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He helped me through these times," Melendez said of Clayton, who was a 
first-round draft pick out of high school. "He talked to me about hitting and 
about Barry Bonds, his approach to the game, and playing every day." 
</P>
<P>
 By staying focused and working hard, Melendez hopes to revive the smooth, 
left-handed swing that made him a dangerous hitter in high school and college, 
and was beginning to blossom with the Dodgers before injuries sidetracked him. 
As a senior at St. Bernard, he batted .539 with 12 home runs and 40 RBIs in 26 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny is by far the best hitter I ever had," Yarnall said. "He had amazing 
bat control. Whenever he would come up to me and tell me, 'This ball is out of 
here,' 100% of the time he would hit a home run. He didn't say it all the time, 
but when he did, it was a home run. I used to tell him, 'You should say it more 
often.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His time away from the game has made Melendez realize how much baseball means 
to him. His dream of reaching the big leagues is stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now when I get there," he said, "I'll appreciate it even more." 
</P>
<P>
 If he does make it, one thing is certain: He'll never wish for a day off 
again.

JAUNTS; A CASTING CALL FOR PIER TOURNAMENT; THE FISHING COMPETITION SATURDAY IS 
ENVISIONED BY VENTURA OFFICIALS AS AN 'INTER-GENERATIONAL EVENT,' JOINING 
YOUTHS, ADULTS, SENIOR CITIZENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Let's see, what will you need to enter Ventura's first fishing tournament off 
its spiffy, rebuilt pier? Fishing gear, sun block, a little luck and one person 
50 years or older. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. You won't need a fishing license or bait, but you will need that 
all-important older person -- unless, of course, you are already such a person. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gone Fishin' Sportfishing Tournament on Saturday is envisioned by the city 
as an "inter-generational event" drawing kids, teen-agers and adults together 
with senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to get people to interact with the senior component of the 
population," said Skip Robinson, recreation coordinator for the city and 
organizer of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every entrant must be accompanied by a 50-plus person, but each fishing 
party (kids, parents, pals, whatever) should include one. Nor does the senior 
member of the party have to fish. He or she can drop a line or, if they'd 
rather, watch for giant starfish clinging to the underpinnings of the pier or 
ponder "Wavespout," the pier's water-spewing sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a tournament for early birds. Fishing begins at 6 a.m., and judging 
will be from noon to 1 p.m. But anglers don't have to be there at dawn. They 
can register for the free tournament any time before the noon weigh-in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be real flexible and casual -- we want people to have a good time," 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a slew of prizes. Restaurants, fishing supply shops and other 
local businesses have donated dinners, fishing trips, tackle, reels, poles and 
gift certificates. Raffled prizes will also be handed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Anglers will be divided into nine age divisions, in addition to such 
categories as father-child, mother-child, grandparent-child, brother-sister, 
and pals under and over 50. The one who snags the biggest fish of the day gets 
the grand prize -- as yet undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a special category for those who reel in sharks, skates, rays 
and related species. Contestants must weigh them and then release them back 
into the water so their numbers are not diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 The prizes are all based on weight. There will be no prizes for most fish 
caught. "Then people would just catch, catch, catch," Robinson said. He wants 
to discourage that and instead encourage people to throw back fish that are not 
competitive. State fish and game department regulations will be in effect 
during the contest, but no fishing license is required for fishing off the 
pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The fishing pros from Ventura's Rex Pray Flyfishing Specialties will be on the 
pier to provide tips on casting with bait or flies and to demonstrate tying 
flies. 
</P>
<P>
 The pier is a popular spot for fishing, now that it has been restored to its 
original length of more than one-third of a mile. At 1,958 feet, it's the 
state's longest wooden pier. The $3.2-million restoration completed last year 
put a new face on the 121-year-old pier, which now attracts walkers as well as 
fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fishermen, the waters around the pier are yielding halibut, mackerel, 
perch, bass, barracuda and shark. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how big are they? Anywhere from less than a pound to 10 pounds and even 
heavier, according to Robinson. They are most likely to be in the two-pound 
range and higher, advises Kelly Roark, who works at Rex Pray's Flyfishing 
Specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 What about bait? "I highly recommend anchovies and mussels," Roark said. 
Shrimp and squid are good, too. Although bait will be available, anglers can 
bring their own tasty concoctions. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the rod and reel: "Off the pier, most of the fish are not going to be 
enormous, so a heavy-duty fresh water setup will be fine," Roark said. Details 
</P>

 * WHAT: Gone Fishin' Sportfishing Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday, 6 a.m. to 1 p.m.

FASHION; PAGEANT CONTESTANTS WILL LEAVE SWIMSUITS AT HOME; THE OJAI COMPETITORS 
WILL FORGO BEACHWEAR, BUT THE TRADITION REMAINS FIRMLY ROOTED AT THE NATIONAL 
LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At woodsy Libbey Park in Ojai, a corps of young women, moving in a circle to 
the disco beat of "I'm Your Boogie Man" on a green tennis court, kick in 
unison, point fingers in the air and toss heads of shining hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed mostly in T-shirts and shorts, they are practicing the dance number 
for the Ojai Pageant, to be held at 7 p.m. Saturday at Nordhoff High School, 
where one of them will be crowned Miss Ojai of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition of choosing a feminine namesake for a town is alive and well in 
Ventura County, where at least a dozen such contests are held each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Costuming for these events is a big part of the attraction and is carefully 
determined, either by standards set by the Miss USA contest or the inspiration 
of local program committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Except in Ojai, where the event is not licensed by the national contest and 
there is no committee. The sponsoring Optimist Club of Ojai leaves the matter 
of dress up to Nancy Hill, director-producer of the pageant for almost a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill says the contest is to build self-esteem, and she likes the contestants 
to feel happy about what they wear. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's costumes will be formal gowns, '70s-style disco dresses for the 
dance number, street wear for the interview with judges. And for the first time 
in pageant history: no swimsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many girls said, 'I would (enter) if I didn't have to wear a bathing 
suit,' " said Hill. "The majority don't mind doing the bathing suit, because 
it's for fitness. And I have found the ones who are (physically) disciplined 
are the ones who make your best queens." 
</P>
<P>
 The firmly rooted tradition of the swimsuit is loosening slightly in local 
queen pageants. Miss Moorpark has been named without beachwear for several 
seasons; the decision at this year's Miss Simi Valley contest is up in the air. 
The rest of the pageant committees we surveyed said the suit remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could eliminate it altogether, we would," said David Caufield, producer 
of the Miss Oxnard pageant. "But we don't do it because it's not fair to the 
girls. If they make it to the state (contest), then all of a sudden they're 
nailed with it, and they need to be able to get in front of an audience in a 
suit." 
</P>
<P>
 The state is not about to drop the swimsuit, said Carolee Munger, director of 
Miss California USA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had this discussion at our national meeting several times," she said. 
"Interestingly enough, when it is brought before the table, it is typically the 
contestants who will say, 'No, leave it in. It's fun.' And they're very proud 
of their physical appearances. The entire country is so health conscious -- 
everybody's mother and everybody's father is a fitness zealot. So, if anything, 
in many ways swimsuits become even more relevant in any kind of national 
pageant." 
</P>
<P>
 A contrasting sentiment was expressed by Mindy Henshaw, 20, of Ventura, a 
cashier at Unocal, who entered the Miss Ojai pageant only when she heard the 
swimsuit event was removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's degrading," she said. "A lot of the pageants are beauty pageants. 
If you are out in a bathing suit, they are looking at the outside of you, not 
the inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Martinez, 18, who will enter Ventura College in the fall, wore a suit 
last year when she was named third runner-up for Miss Ojai. Competing again 
this year, she said, "I'm happy that they took it out. It's really embarrassing 
to get up there in a swimsuit. You have the judges real close to you in the 
daytime, and you have to turn every way so they can see every side of you. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you walked up on stage, you had a little sarong skirt on, tied at the 
side, and you had to untie it and flop it over your shoulder and walk off. It 
was kind of weird." 
</P>
<P>
 The swimsuit has been replaced by a tank top and shorts in which contestants 
appear prior to the public event. This will result in a fitness award, which 
does not add points toward the queen title. Judges will rate contestants on 
composure, posture, stage presence and eye contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditions die hard. Swimsuit competition for aspiring queen was born in 1921, 
when the first Miss America competition was proudly labeled a bathing beauty 
contest. Beauty has lost a lot of points on the charts since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, during a Miss America special on NBC, the audience could call an 
800 number and vote on the issue: Are swimsuits relevant to the pageant? Should 
they stay in? Over 60% of the audience said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 So, officials figured, why fool around with success? The suits will be back 
this fall, and there's no plan to phase them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there's an innovation in this grandmother of pageant ceremonies 
-- maybe in response to that 40% who registered a "heck no" or a "maybe": 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, the swimsuit event will feature bare feet. High heels will be 
banished, and the runway parade will be saved for the ball gowns. Contestants' 
swimwear will be observed only as they cavort on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It's history in the making. Another milestone in the chronicle of queen 
pageantry, updated for the '90s. You might think of it as footprints in the 
sand.

 When the Ventura County Fair opens Wednesday, kids will have a lot more to 
enjoy than the fair's usual 3 Rs: rides, rabbits and rhubarb. 
</P>
<P>
 For a respite from the roller-coasters and cotton candy, stop by the Youth 
Building at 3 p.m. most days and check out the contest for kids. It's something 
different each day. 
</P>
<P>
 A week from today, the kids will be decorating little wooden birdhouses that 
they can take home. On Aug. 19, it's kite-making and, the day after that, it's 
creative sandwich design with assorted goodies such as peanut butter, jelly, 
raisins and carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest lineup for the remainder of the fair is equally zany: creating 
goofy costumes out of newspapers, applying glitzy decor to cowboy boots made of 
construction paper, swiveling a Hula-Hoop, decorating bandannas and flying 
paper airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids will be given a time limit (less than an hour), and little prizes and 
ribbons will be awarded in three age categories: 4-7 years, 8-12 years and 
13-17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 For parents and kids who like to team up in the kitchen, the fair has a 
dessert-making contest at 6 p.m. Aug. 21 in the Home Arts Building. Teams have 
90 minutes to whip up luscious concoctions. Some drop-dead creations from past 
fairs have included ice cream cake, chocolate truffles and lemon meringue pie. 
The prize for this one is $50. (Preregistration is required and few spots may 
be available by fair time.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a perennial visitor to the Youth Building, you'll notice that the 
old Quonset-style building has been spruced up. New paint and better lighting 
make it a much brighter space for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 As the fair approaches, workers are completing a barnyard farm scene in the 
center of the Youth Building. Child-size bears with mechanized parts look like 
they are getting ready to go to the fair. One of them will be loading 
vegetables into a truck. Another will be moving its arms to put the final 
touches on a piece of needlework and another will be grooming a sheep for 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the Youth Building, mechanized pigs with long eyelashes are busy 
in a make-believe bakery. Vintage tractors, including a pedal-operated one, 
will also be on display. 
</P>
<P>
 The usual 4-H projects and other youth exhibits will be set up here again this 
year: arts and crafts, needlework, photography, foods and table settings, to 
name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular activities at the fair last year was a scavenger hunt 
for kids on youth day, according to Teri Raley, spokeswoman for the fair. "We 
had 2,500 kids do this last year," she said. "It was unbelievably successful." 
</P>
<P>
 They're doing it again this year on youth day, Aug. 19, when kids 12 and under 
are admitted free. It's an all-day event. At the entrance, kids pick up a card 
that shows 10 stops around the fairgrounds. As kids circulate looking at 
different areas, they get their cards stamped at the designated locations. Then 
they redeem the card for a prize. 
</P>
<P>
 There are scads of other fun things for kids to do at the fair. The Children's 
Dell area has daily entertainment, including storytelling by Ojai's Jim Cogan, 
magic by Shawn McMaster of Ventura, the Bumblebeez singing group, singer Lori 
Richards, and the singing duo Kim and Leana. Nearby is the petting zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who think rides when they think fair, here are some tips: Unlimited 
ride bracelets for the midway are available Aug. 18 and 25 for $12. They are 
good from noon to 8 p.m. Or, if you buy ride tickets before Aug. 17, you can 
get 20 rides for $20. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a warm-up for the fair, try Kid's Day at Ventura Harbor on Sunday, 
11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what's on tap at Ventura Harbor Village: a free magic show at noon on 
the lawn in front of the carousel, pony rides, miniature horse and buggy rides, 
a petting zoo, face painting, sand sculpturing, sidewalk chalk art and kite 
flying demonstrations. The Latin jazz group Nuestro plays from 1:30 to 4:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Camarillo's Youth Theater takes "Snow White" to the stage at the Camarillo 
Airport Theater, 330 Skyway Drive, beginning Friday and running through Aug. 
27. Show times are 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, and 2 p.m. Sundays. For ticket

SHOPTALK; SAVINGS AND SELECTION ABOUND FOR THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL CROWD; SALES AT 
AREA MALLS INCLUDE EVERYTHING FROM SHOES TO BACKPACKS, DENIM TO CALCULATORS. 
</P>

<P>
 If you'd "rather be saling" -- to quote an old bumper sticker -- then head to 
Ventura County malls. 
</P>
<P>
 What we found when we staked out the malls recently were not only 
back-to-school sales but also fall preview sales, summer clearance sales, plain 
old sale sales, and a bunch of other reasons for marking down prices. Let's 
just say it was kind of a bargain hunter's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid all that, we did try our best to stick to our goal of locating 
merchandise specifically on sale, or prominently displayed, as back-to-school 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 We went to The Oaks in Thousand Oaks, the Esplanade in Oxnard and the 
Buenaventura Mall in Ventura. And here's what we found. Keep in mind that 
sales, and available stock, come and go pretty quickly this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 First stop, The Oaks. What impressed us there was an abundance of 
nice-looking, quality backpacks for school. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's Outpost had a Jansport backpack sale scheduled to last through 
Saturday. We found a regularly priced $30 nylon pack marked down 40%, and a $45 
nylon-suede pack discounted 20%. (The Miller's Outpost at the Buenaventura Mall 
had 20% off all Jansport packs.) 
</P>
<P>
 The largest selection of backpacks at The Oaks was at Oshman's Sporting Goods 
store, though the prices were somewhat higher in the Jansport models. The store 
had a nice supply of Eastpak packs, with the lowest priced at $29.99. Oshman's, 
by the way, has a random drawing contest for a "year's supply" (limit five 
pairs) of shoes for your child. Deadline to enter is Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of shoes, over at the Stride Rite shoe store they have a sale on 
sizes 5 to about 8, with most pairs tagged for $19.95-$24.95, $10-$15 off the 
usual price. 
</P>
<P>
 And the 5-7-9 shop (also found at The Esplanade) has a 40%-off sale on girls 
clothes (sizes 0-9) scheduled to last through the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On to the Buenaventura Mall. We were pretty excited to find a back-to-school 
sale at Footaction USA, with prices cut 20% to 40% on name-brand shoes like 
Nike and Reebok. We found a pair of Nike Airs for $49.88, down from $84.99. 
This sale is supposed to last through Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps our favorite sale of the mall tour was at Radio Shack, which has 
outlets at all three malls. The store offers back-to-school electronics 
packages for elementary, high school and college students. 
</P>
<P>
 The "L-M-N-tary Pack" includes a pencil box/calculator, a cordless pencil 
sharpener, an AM/FM radio with earphone, four C batteries, and two AA 
batteries. It sells for $25, instead of the $30.85 if the items were sold 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we dropped in at The Esplanade, where the highlight last week was a 
25% to 50% off sale on a variety of clothing at Kids Mart. We hesitate to 
mention that because the sale is over. But we were told that this week you can 
expect a discount on denim items. 
</P>
<P>
 As for school accessories, the Payless ShoeSource (also at the Buenaventura 
Mall) had a cute little plastic Crayola Carry Bag, with four Crayola crayons, 
discounted from $7.99 to $5 -- not earth shattering, but cute. 
</P>
<P>
 And in all this mall talk let's not forget that J.C. Penney (The Oaks, 
Buenaventura) and Sears (The Oaks, Esplanade) will be having back-to-school 
sales throughout the month. 
</P>
<P>
 We realize that getting your kids ready for school may seem more daunting than 
it was to attend school yourself. Next week we hope to alleviate some of that 
pain by comparing prices on school essentials like notebooks, pencil bags and 
lunch boxes.

GOINGS ON; 2 ART SHOWS TO VIEW WITH AN OPEN MIND; 'FISH TANK SONATA' BEGINS 
SATURDAY. AND DOGS AND ALLIGATORS SURF IN RON ANDERSON'S STEVE STEIN GALLERY 
EXHIBITION.

<P>
 A pair of art exhibit openings lead the list of things to do/ or see this 
weekend up the coast. Both shows have a fairly important prerequisite attached: 
View them with an open mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara's Contemporary Arts Forum will present photographer Arthur 
Tress' "Fish Tank Sonata" exhibit beginning Saturday. And, yes, the collection 
of 63 photos is unique, as the title might suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Tress spent three years traveling around the country, fish tank in hand, 
scouring flea markets in search of toys and props representative of 1940s and 
'50s America. The photos were taken of the props inside the water-filled fish 
tank, in front of thought-provoking backdrops and landscapes. The work is 
accompanied by prose written by Tress. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographer's work has been exhibited in the Centre Pompidou in Paris, 
the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, and in other museums and galleries around 
the world. His exhibit at CAF will run through Sept. 2. There will be an 
opening reception from 5 to 7 p.m. Saturday. The gallery is open 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays. It is on the second level of the Paseo Nuevo 
shopping center, at Chapala and De La Guerra streets. For information, call 
966-5373. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also opening Saturday is a show by former UC Santa Barbara art student Ron 
Anderson, who will have his surfing-inspired, three-dimensional, light-hearted 
wall hangings on display at the Steve Stein Gallery in Montecito. Look for dogs 
and alligators getting set to hang 10. (Or would it be three or four?) 
</P>
<P>
 There will be opening receptions for Anderson from 5 to 9 p.m. Saturday and 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday. The exhibit will run through Aug. 22. The gallery is 
open 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Sundays. It is at 1155 Coast Village Road. Call 565-2032. 
</P>
<P>

</P>

of their new tape, "Public Nudism," on Friday night at Joseppi's in Santa

St. Call 962-5516 for information. 
</P>

information, call 963-0611, Ext. 4530. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Michael and Valerie Nelson and the Magical Moonshine Theatre group will share 
animal stories with the help of life-size puppets, masks and musical 
instruments at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The show will include the story of Br'er Rabbit, who saves the forest from the 
nasty, animal-eating lion, and a Native American tale of Coyote and the Grizzly 
Bear, in which the traditional trickster Coyote saves Mountain Ram's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Show time is 3 p.m. Tickets to the show are $2, with admission to the museum. 
The museum is at 2559 Puesta del Sol Road. Call 682-4711 for information.

 Miracle Worx Productions, a dinner theater company, is currently performing 
"Owl and the Pussycat" at the La Cantina Room in Santa Barbara's Radisson

Barbara residents Marco Del Chiaro and Jacqueline Hayes. Show times are 
Thursday through Saturday at 9 p.m. (buffet dinner at 8 p.m.) and Sunday at 2

THEATER REVIEW; NOVELTY SONGS BUOYED BY PERFORMERS' LUNACY; LOBERO 
RETROSPECTIVE HAS GOOD-NATURED APPEAL, BUT OVERALL CONCEPT DOESN'T LEAVE MUCH 
ROOM FOR EMOTIONAL RANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes" referred to in the title of this amiable revue 
at the Lobero Theatre were compiled from the upbeat novelty songs that helped 
keep American minds off their troubles during the Great Depression and World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The accent is definitely on diversion rather than turbulence in Milt Larsen 
and Gene Casey's musical anthology, a goofy, frenetically paced evening of 
songs and shtick affectionately performed by four singers and a pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 The whirlwind retrospective hits on more than 75 songs from the 1920s, '30s 
and '40s, although not all are performed in their entirety -- often just a few 
lines in a medley, which keeps the momentum brisk. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, this self-described "song smorgasbord of would-be garbage that 
turned into gold" is buoyed aloft by the inspired lunacy of its performers. 
</P>
<P>
 William Ackey, in particular, is a nonstop dynamo of high-energy abandon -- no 
surprise to Lobero Theatre regulars who recall his rubber-limbed dance with a 
dummy in the 1991 Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera revival of "Singin' in the 
Rain." Not only does Ackey make his first-rate singing and dancing seem 
effortless, but he even supplies the hilarious Spike Jones-style sound effects 
in a spectacular rendition of "Cocktails for Two." 
</P>
<P>
 Although nowhere near as sprightly, Lloyd Pedersen uses more refined comic 
irony as an effective counterpoint to Ackey's ebullience. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lioness's share of the female singing parts, Mary Gillis proves an 
agreeable presence, but often brings near-operatic precision and finesse to 
material that would be better served with a good belt. She comes into her own, 
however, with her brassy delivery in one of the show's high points, the bluesy 
"One Meat Ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Pamela Hall's staging embodies the frivolous mind-set of the songs -- 
like having the cast pound out percussion on their stools for "Jungle Drums." 
Hall herself also appears to deliver some loopy solos, like the tongue-twisting 
"Where Did Robinson Go With Friday on a Saturday Night?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Phillips provides the piano accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its good-natured appeal, however, the show's overall concept doesn't 
leave much room for emotional range. At times, the creators get carried away by 
their own cleverness, especially when trying to shoehorn diverse selections 
into medleys linked by a common theme -- the "What's in a Name" pastiche of 
songs with women's names, then men's, in their titles seems interminable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes" is the kind of no-frills production best suited to 
small, intimate venues and loses some of its charm to the expanse in the larger 
Lobero Theatre. Ventura County patrons accustomed to the lavish production 
values of the Lobero's previous tenants, the Pasadena Playhouse and the Santa 
Barbara Civic Light Opera, are likely to be disappointed unless they calibrate 
their expectations accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a ways to travel for a pretty specialized evening, but anyone crazy about 
the songs of that bygone era will find these "Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes" worth 
the commute. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Lobero Theatre, 33 E. Canon Perdido St., Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Through Aug. 19. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m.; Aug. 
19 at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $17.50.

 This is the first week of summer vacation at Doc'n Sandy's Cafe in Santa 
Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 As they do each August, Doc (Howard Jarvis), and his wife, Sandy Jarvis, close 
up shop for several weeks to take a breather. It's an unsettling time for cafe 
regulars who, said Sandy, joke about going on diets until the place reopens. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year's August absence is the least of the worries for those diners. 
</P>
<P>
 About three weeks ago, Doc and Sandy put their 16-year-old establishment up 
for sale. The diners "took it badly," said Sandy. "They don't believe it. They 
won't believe it until we actually do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy said the pending sale has nothing to do with poor business. It's just 
the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband is just really tired. We've been here a long time. He's been in 
the restaurant business 40 years," she said. "We really hate to lose this 
place. We really, really do. There is tremendous potential here." 
</P>
<P>
 Potential buyers have already shown some interest.

 There is a definite multicultural slant to the salsa-tasting competition at 
Saturday's Oxnard Salsa Festival '94 in Plaza Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got salsas coming to us from people of the Indian culture, Hispanic, 
Italian, Irish, Scandinavian and Jewish -- there's a gentleman giving me a 
kosher salsa," said Rosemary Pace, chairwoman of this inaugural festival, 
organized by the Oxnard Downtowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Festivities will run from 10 a.m. to about 3:30 p.m. The salsa contest will 
begin at 11 a.m. with winners announced about 1 p.m. Plaza Park is located at 
5th Street between C and D streets.

 Nona's Courtyard Cafe in Ventura is scheduled to begin a new Thursday evening 
dinner special tonight. Chef Jonathan Enabnit said the weekly 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. 
promotion will feature "lightly modified versions of our regular dinner menu at 
greatly reduced prices." Nona's Courtyard is at 67 California St.

 Amateur bakers, don't forget the Ventura County Fair's Baked Foods and 
Confections contests. The fair runs Wednesday through Aug. 28, but entries are

confection and other baked-goods competitions. Call the fairgrounds at

RESTAURANT REVIEW; EL ENCANTO'S LUXURY CAN'T DISGUISE FOOD THAT'S LACKLUSTER; 
BUT CAREFUL CHOICES SUCH AS FIRE-ROASTED PEPPER SOUP, MONKFISH AND FRESH 
LINGUINE DO JUSTICE TO THE ELEGANT SETTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 El Encanto Hotel is one of the jewels of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Small white guest cottages amid clotted purple vines and broad green banana 
leaves surround a hilltop manse overlooking the city and the ocean. The setting 
and the view, for decades the lure of the wealthy and powerful as well as a 
tweedy, rumpled brand of local, certainly do enchant. 
</P>
<P>
 Dining happens in the main house in one large room, elegantly set and made 
spacious with windows dominated by the city and ocean below or stands of 
ancient green trees; and on a large veranda, canopied from sun but sufficiently 
al fresco and angled to the view as to feel Mediterranean. Indeed, it is so 
transporting up here that it may as well be the Amalfi Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 If only the food could consistently produce such magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it does, and that is the good news. A perfect mixed greens salad, 
dressed so lightly and fragrantly as to defy its own weight in olive oil, or a 
sauteed fillet of monkfish, scented so softly but deeply with garlic and 
parsley as to thoroughly ennoble something once known as "poor man's lobster," 
testify to an expert, imaginative hand in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 But overcooked lamb loin that has mealy texture and metallic flavor? Or 
roasted squab that suffers the same stale fate? That is the bad news, 
especially when the tab for two, with a humble bottle of Chardonnay, tops $100. 
Somehow, on these bad nights, the view really does change. 
</P>
<P>
 Choose carefully. Among appetizers, the chilled fire roasted red pepper soup 
($5.50) is a dream: thick puree of sweetly fragrant peppers is topped with 
slices of faintly smoky grilled eggplant and chunks of Roma tomatoes. The 
result is bracing, refreshing, a delight to the eye as well as palate, 
altogether original. The mixed greens salad ($6.50) is not only the model of 
restraint, it is distinctive for the incorporation of pear and balsamic hints 
in an ultra light vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar salad ($6.75) is a sure bet, for its pungent and goop-proof dressing, 
bona fide Reggiano Parmesan cheese, and anchovy fillets. And the smoked 
free-range chicken salad ($9), in which organically grown field greens from 
Carpinteria are tossed with avocado, pine nuts and sherry vinaigrette and 
placed atop slices of smoky chicken breast, is first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spirit falls with bruschetta of Maine lobster ($8.75): a 
standard-issue tomato/basil/garlic compote topped with bits of somewhat 
over-the-hill lobster meat (and not enough of them at that). Soft shell crab 
salad ($9.50) sparkles in fresh watercress tossed in lemon caper vinaigrette 
but fades under the weight of a perfectly fresh whole crab that is burdened by 
too much frying fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh egg linguine with sauteed porcini and morels ($18.25) is wonderful, 
redolent of the damp forest floor and lent edge by addition of asparagus tips 
and a heady whiff of grated black truffle. If there is one time to make peace 
with a rich cream-based sauce, this is the dish. 
</P>
<P>
 But paella with blue prawns ($23.75) challenges. Firm rice, risotto-like in 
texture, arrives as prop to the arresting presentation of prawns, sea scallops, 
mussels, chicken and sausage. Yes, the dish sounds rustic, forward, in the 
tradition of great paellas . But instead it is elusive, overwrought: an 
under-flavored, uptown rendering of a farm dish whose individual flavors must 
meld as well as curtsy so politely. 
</P>
<P>
 The monkfish ($19.75) may well be where the kitchen's ambition comes together 
for greatest effect. It arrives sliced in round pieces, arrayed in a circle not 
unlike maki, surrounding a julienne of vegetables with roasted garlic, parsley 
and lemon butter. The fish is firm, ever-so-slightly undercooked to preserve 
sweetness and texture, and combines perfectly with the delicate accompaniments. 
The result is singular, original, transcendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain of the meats did not fare as well. Lamb loin ($25.25), carved 
generously from the rack, arrived overcooked and with distinct texture and 
flavor problems -- it went largely uneaten. The roasted squab ($24.50), 
promisingly set in Pinot Noir sauce, carried stale, overly gamy notes in the 
flavor and some toughness as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But grilled tenderloin of beef ($25.50) succeeded splendidly. And how could it 
not? The meat was fresh, expertly cut, deeply flavorsome, perfectly cooked to 
order, framed in flavor by a dense, focused port wine sauce and then nearly 
outdone by the opulence of an accompanying shiitake and oyster mushroom saute, 
roasted garlic and shoestring potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts (all $4.75) are uniformly excellent: berry tarts bursting with lemon 
edge and flaky crusts to El Encanto's sentimental favorite, the Floating 
Island. In that dish, a giant poached meringue dollop, topped with almond 
shavings and caramel droplets, is set adrift in creme Anglaise for one long, 
decadent "sail." 
</P>
<P>
 El Encanto's wine list is moderate in size and extremely well-selected. 
Although it's no bargain sheet, some values do emerge, among them the 
wide-beamed, bright, always satisfying Fess Parker '92 Chardonnay at $24. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that El Encanto's kitchen has raised the level of its game 
dramatically over the last year. It is possible to have a highly original and 
inspiring meal that befits the view -- and in the many years of El Encanto's 
polite service to its genteel clientele, that was not always so. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also possible to face a failed meal and pay a lot of money for it -- 
and knowing that there is real talent in the kitchen, this needn't be so. 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster the odds of making your visit successful, go early, well before the 
day's light is out. Have a drink on the terrace. Take in the view. Breathe the 
eucalyptus-scented air. Wonder whether it's California or Italy. And became 
wrapped within the wonderful ethos that makes El Encanto a special, Old World 
place.

 DOWN ON THE FARM: Let the players strike (A1). Who cares? There's plenty of 
minor league action a few hours away. Inside today's Sports section (C10): a 
complete guide to nearby minor league games. . . . You'll see things you'd 
never find in the big leagues, such as the blue sea serpent Hamlet, the mascot 
for the Lake Elsinore Storm. "He's the biggest personality on the team," says 
GM Kevin Haughian.

 WOODSTOCK I: It was 1969, and thousands came to hear performers such as Jimi 
Hendrix and Joe Cocker. . . . This wasn't Woodstock, which marks its 25th 
anniversary this month. It was Newport '69, which took place over three days in 
June at Devonshire Downs fairground in Northridge. . . . About 200,000 people 
showed up. "We weren't prepared with jackets or sleeping bags," said record 
producer Harvey Kubernik. "It was real cold at night." 
</P>
<P>
 WOODSTOCK II: Among those who made it to the real Woodstock was Joan Bryant 
(above). Now 47 and a resident of Woodland Hills, she is getting new attention 
after making the cover of Newsweek (B1). "It's so surprising that people care 
what I have to say," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 ROYAL TREATMENT: Mark Gubicza is a starting pitcher for the Kansas City 
Royals. But he also knows how to earn a save. When Gubicza, of Northridge, 
heard that some students at Our Savior's First Lutheran School in Granada Hills 
were still stressed out from the quake, he and the Royals flew them to a game 
in Kansas City. . . . On Tuesday, they saw him in Anaheim (B3).

 PADDLE BILL: Assemblyman James E. Rogan of Glendale was away from Sacramento 
and missed his chance Wednesday to debate the merits of public paddlings for 
graffiti vandals. (A3) . . . Rogan, a former judge, is a key supporter of the 
proposed legislation. North Hollywood Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman disagrees: 
"We continue to focus on things that we know strike a chord with people, but we 
know they don't do any good," she says. Michael Arkush

JUDGE SAID TO REPLACE CUTLER AT WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Abner J. Mikva will replace Lloyd N. Cutler as White House counsel, a 
senior official said Wednesday. The selection, which could be announced as 
early as today, will add stature to the relatively young White House staff and 
bring political acumen to one of the most vital jobs in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the job had been 
offered to Mikva and he accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikva, 68, is chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit. He is a former member of the House of Representatives and its 
Ways and Means Committee, and had served in the Illinois Legislature. Appointed 
to the bench by President Jimmy Carter in 1979, he is a leader of the court's 
liberal wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler, 76, is a high-powered Washington attorney brought in by Clinton to 
salvage the White House's credibility amid allegations that the staff meddled 
in the Whitewater inquiry.

MARINE COPTER EXERCISE SENDS SCARED RESIDENTS TO THEIR PHONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Droning helicopters kept hundreds of Oxnard residents awake Tuesday night as a 
detachment of Marines from Camp Pendleton practiced urban navigation training 
over a quiet residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Simulating a terrorist situation, six Marine Corps helicopters hovered and 
swooped in the vicinity of the Ventura Freeway and Rose Avenue from about 9 to 
10:30 p.m., frightening and angering nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was loud. They weren't very far from my house," Oxnard resident Janet 
Heistad said. "You could hear this 'glob-glob-glob, glob-glob-glob.' It was 
irritating, to say the least." The noise startled residents, many of whom came 
out of their homes to investigate the unusual scene. Cathy Vaughn and her three 
young children, who live on Yale Court in the Rio Lindo neighborhood, watched 
the helicopters from their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were right above our heads," Vaughn said. "I was thinking that somebody 
broke out of jail or something. It scared me." 
</P>
<P>
 The nighttime maneuvers were part of the 13th Marine Expeditionary's Unit's 
180-day training mission, which is being carried out at various sites along the 
West Coast, Sgt. Doug Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines will be training in Ventura County, mostly in Port Hueneme, until 
Friday, but will not be conducting helicopter maneuvers over residential areas 
again, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard area was selected for navigation training because it represented a 
typical urban neighborhood, Anderson said. The Marines needed a populated 
location to carry out a training exercise simulating a terrorist situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scenario that we had was that there were terrorists in the community . . 
. and the United States Marines are called upon to go in and alleviate the 
situation," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour maneuver featured six helicopters -- including AH-1 Cobras and 
UH-1 Hueys and a small Marine unit on foot in the Oxnard area. 
</P>
<P>
 The noisy helicopters, which were also heard in Ventura, triggered more than 
100 phone calls to the Oxnard Police Department from concerned residents, 
police said. Ventura police officials said they received no complaints, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said he received "quite a few" calls Tuesday night, as police 
referred residents to the Marines. "Let's put it this way: I got my first phone 
call at 9:15, and the phone rang continuously until 11 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Heistad and Vaughn were among the callers and were frustrated that the police 
were not forthcoming about the military exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wouldn't tell me it was the Marines," Heistad said. "They wouldn't tell 
me anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called later and got Marines who told me it was some sort of training 
exercise that they were doing and that they couldn't do it during the daytime." 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines did not notify residents beforehand because it would have created 
a safety risk, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we announced that this was going to be happening, we would have had a lot 
of spectators," he said. "And that would have been detrimental to the training 
mission."

VENTURA COUNTY FAIR; GAMBLERS GRUMBLING ABOUT NEW QUARTERS; FAIRGROUNDS: 
BETTORS ARE CONFINED TO CROWDED TENTS DURING THE COUNTY FAIR. BUT OFFICIALS' 
MONEY IS ON A NEW OFF-TRACK FACILITY TO OPEN NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hot, sweaty and bothered, Ventura resident Jim Barrick considered his race 
picks and impatiently bided his time.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be glad when they open the permanent building," said Barrick, 38, a 
fisherman who was betting on the horses earlier this week at the Ventura County 
Fairgrounds' off-track betting facility. "This is terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually the county's "Watch & Wager" operation runs out of three fairground 
buildings, but during the county fair, gamblers are unceremoniously shoved 
aside into unair-conditioned tents. There they step over each other and grumble 
about how they miss their cushier, roomier surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrick and his colleagues have been betting in the tent since fair officials 
forced them out of the regular complex July 1. They cannot return to the 
buildings until early September. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't set up well for people to spend so much money," Barrick continued, 
noting that the usual facilities include waitresses and roomy tables with a 
clear view of the television screen. "Over there it adds a lot of class."  
</P>
<P>
 Fairground promoters promise class will abound when they open their new 
$5.4-million betting emporium next January. No longer will the bettors be 
shuttled back and forth in summertime between the trio of buildings and the 
sweltering tent. Then, it will be only the best all year long for Ventura 
County's horse racing fans, promoters say. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, about one-third of the state-run fairground's nearly $6 million in 
annual revenue comes from off-track betting operations, giving fairground 
officials more than enough reason to shower their gamblers with amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to rival anything this county's ever seen," declared Michael 
Paluszak, the enthusiastic general manager of the fairgrounds. "It's the most 
exciting thing that's happened at Seaside Park in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Rising 20 feet above the ocean at the mouth of the Ventura River, built in a 
nouveau California Mission style, the new complex will sport three levels of 
betting rooms and oodles of televisions in its 36,500-square-foot interior and 
patios. The gambling hall will be under construction throughout this year's 
fair, which begins next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter where you are in the facility, you won't be more than 10 feet from 
a TV screen," Paluszak promised. "There'll be hundreds of 'em, everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The building's ground floor will house the Shoreline Room, where gamblers pay 
a $4 admission and can buy snacks from a concession stand, Paluszak said. Up a 
level and costing $8 for admission will be the Surfside Room, where casually 
dressed patrons can order meals without breaking their betting stride, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if customers want real luxury while they bet on the horses, they can 
ascend to the Island View Room on the top level, Paluszak said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the current white, flapping tent is a jungle of aggressive 
bettors, crammed practically shoulder-to-shoulder along long picnic-type 
benches, their sports pages and betting books spread pell-mell across the table 
tops. Green Astroturf carpets the floor and the pungent smells of hot dogs, 
sauerkraut and popcorn drift across the seating arena from a small grill. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is awful," said Lee, a gambler from Northridge, as he hunched over 
betting sheets. "It's too crowded, too noisy. I don't like it when we're in 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said the atmosphere in the tent deters them from gambling as much as 
they usually would. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crowds make me nervous," said west San Fernando Valley resident Ria Brown, 
curling her mouth into an anxious smile. "If I'm in the other place, I could 
stay all day. Here, I only come for one race, and then I have to go."

OIL FIRM, FOREMAN TO PLEAD NO CONTEST IN SPILL; COURTS: BERRY PETROLEUM CRUDE 
LEAKED INTO MCGRATH LAKE FOR FOUR DAYS LAST YEAR IN THE COUNTY'S WORST SUCH 
INCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Both the oil company and foreman responsible for Ventura County's worst 
pipeline spill ever have agreed to plead no contest to separate misdemeanor 
charges in Municipal Court next week, a prosecutor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement to be formalized in court next Wednesday, attorneys for 
Berry Petroleum and production official Ralph Edmonds will not admit any 
criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the no-contest pleas are equal to guilty pleas, except that they cannot be 
used against the defendants in establishing any civil liability related to the 
criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 State regulators are still piecing together a civil case against Berry that 
could result in further penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berry has requested that we not disclose any of the details until the time of 
the arraignment," said Glen M. Reiser, the special prosecutor retained earlier 
this year by the Ventura County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge has to order the stipulation into effect on the 17th," he said. "So 
it's not a done deal until the gavel hits the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Berry Petroleum operated an underground pipeline along Harbor Boulevard near 
Oxnard that ruptured Dec. 21, 1993, and spilled 84,000 gallons of heavy crude 
into the wetlands at McGrath Lake for four days before being noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of gallons were then pushed into the Pacific Ocean, forcing the 
closure of seven miles of coastline and necessitating a two-month cleanup 
effort. Hundreds of birds coated with oil died as a result of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will plead no contest to a single misdemeanor charge of failing to 
notify regulatory officials about the leak, Reiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty will be limited to a "substantial" monetary fine to be distributed 
to state and local environmental restoration funds, Reiser said. He refused to 
say how much the fine would be until the court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Larry L. Hines, who represents Berry Petroleum, declined to discuss 
the settlement Wednesday, saying his clients would wait until next Wednesday 
"to give the company's version of these events." 
</P>
<P>
 But the oil company already has filed claims against six local agencies for 
failing to respond to early reports of the spill. The leak was not discovered 
for four days, when federal inspectors noticed a sheen of oil on the ocean west 
of McGrath Lake on Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Several area law enforcement agencies had been alerted to the spill at least a 
day before and failed to respond, the company claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds, the production foreman on duty at the time the pipeline broke, will 
plead no contest to a misdemeanor charge of illegally releasing oil or 
petroleum products into a state waterway, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 He will face "an agreed-upon punishment, which is not insignificant" when he 
is sentenced sometime after he enters his plea, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds still works for Bush Oil, the Berry Petroleum subsidiary that operated 
the ruptured pipeline. He did not return phone calls Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Lou Carpiac of Ventura, is traveling out of the country and 
could not be reached for comment. John C. Orr, a partner in Carpiac's law firm, 
declined to discuss the agreement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiser said Edmonds is a former Navy seaman who has worked for Bush Oil for 
about five years. It is his first job supervising an oil production facility. 
He sold production equipment for several years previously, Reiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Edmonds' relative lack of experience probably contributed 
to his alleged failure to notice that tens of thousands of gallons of oil never 
reached the storage tank it was being pumped into. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they view Edmonds as ultimately responsible for the leak, prosecutors 
insisted that he be charged separately in the case. The oil company agreed in 
June to plead no contest to a single charge, although prosecutors would not 
specify whether it was a misdemeanor or felony.  
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of (Edmonds) proceeding to trial all by himself was not too 
enticing," Reiser said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; BLOOD AGENCY OPENS A NEW DONOR CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 United Blood Services is looking for new blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to increase blood donations, the nonprofit agency, which is Ventura 
County's sole blood provider, opened a new donor center in Simi Valley on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency closed its old Simi Valley center after it was damaged in the Jan. 
17 earthquake, said Lauren Mourmouris , a spokeswoman for the agency. United 
Blood Services also has centers in Ventura and Thousand Oaks. A roving 
bloodmobile serves the rest of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Simi Valley center is situated at the corner of Cochran Street and 
Sycamore Drive in the Alpha Beta shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify as a blood donor, you must be in good health, weigh at least 110 
pounds and be between the ages of 17 and 80. 
</P>
<P>
 You will be disqualified from donating blood if you have any type of 
infection, a new tattoo, a heart condition or have ever tested positive for 
hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, being on medication will not disqualify you from giving blood, 
Mourmouris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People shouldn't automatically assume that they can't give just because they 
are taking some kind of medication," she said. "It really depends on what 
you're taking it for." 
</P>
<P>
 Its takes the body about 24 hours to replace the pint of blood drawn during 
the donation process, and up to six weeks for the body to restore its red blood 
cell supply, Mourmouris said. A person can donate blood every eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 People with O positive blood, the most common blood type, are especially 
encouraged to donate, Mourmouris said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or to schedule an appointment at any United Blood 
Services center, call 654-8104. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PANEL ORDERS MAN TO REPLACE NATIVE 
PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Angered by a Thousand Oaks resident who clear-cut 10 acres of natural growth 
on his property, city planners denied the resident's request to replant his 
spacious yard with flowering trees and grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Probst's plan to replace native plants with intricate landscaping on 
the hillside at Westlake Boulevard and Kanan Road brought the ire of area 
residents, who said Probst betrayed them by scraping all the vegetation from 
his land. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1985 agreement, the Planning Commission allowed the original owner of the 
land to build a home atop the 16-acre parcel in exchange for preserving the 
natural growth on the acreage below. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Probst acquired the land, he proceeded to scrape away the vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Probst's architect, who represented him at the Monday night hearing, said 
Probst wanted to clear the brush because he was concerned about the risk of a 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives from the Westlake Village North homeowners association 
said they believed that Probst scraped the land as a ploy to gain approval for 
his choice of landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Probst probably reasoned that anyone would prefer landscaping to a 
scraped, dirt hillside. Architect Stephen Halley denied that, calling the 
scraping an honest mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were further angered by Halley's request that the commission permit 
Probst to build an 1,800-square-foot bunker to house gardening equipment and 
two electric golf carts used to motor Probst around his property. 
</P>
<P>
 Several planning commissioners bristled at that request, including 
Commissioner Mervyn Kopp, who has traditionally sided with property owners in 
land-use matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refuse to play the fool here," Kopp said. "I don't know what he would build 
if we approved this. It could be Barnum & Bailey's for all we know." 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy debate, the commission voted 3 to 1 to deny Probst's proposal 
and required him to replant the barren hillside with plants native to the area. 
Chairman Forrest Frields dissented. Commissioner Lew Wasserman was absent.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; ARROYO SIMI HABITAT RESTORATION FINISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pulling weeds from around the cottonwoods and sycamores they planted months 
ago, members of the Environmental Coalition's Moorpark Chapter put the final 
touches Wednesday on a yearlong effort to restore native habitat along the 
Arroyo Simi. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of nearly 400 volunteers from local high schools and the 
neighboring community, the group has painstakingly pulled out tons of such 
invasive plants as the ravenous arundo donax -- a giant reed that chokes out 
native vegetation -- and replanted the area with more than 6,000 cuttings of 
native mule fat and willow brushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Environmental Coalition will periodically check the area to 
make sure the native vegetation they planted continues to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it's in pretty good shape right now," said Roseann Mikos, who 
has managed the restoration project. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikos said that biologists expect about half the cuttings to survive and 
roughly 70% of the sycamores and cottonwoods to make it. So far the survival 
rates are much higher, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Coalition received $64,000 from the California Department of 
Water Resources to restore the five-acre site. Because there are no concrete 
flood control channels in the area, it was considered one of the best sites for 
restoration on the arroyo that stretches from Simi Valley to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikos said the invasive species removed by the group were crowding out native 
vegetation that birds and animals depend on. 
</P>
<P>
 After the invasive plants were removed, the land was replanted with native 
vegetation. Watering of the plants ended in July, Mikos said, and weeding ended 
this week. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; FEDERER TO RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking improved services for the elderly and a separate city fire department, 
Simi Valley resident Ernie Federer announced his candidacy Wednesday for City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Federer, 28, works as director of quality management at a psychiatric hospital 
in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 A six-year Simi Valley resident, Federer ran unsuccessfully for a council seat 
in 1992, placing fourth out of 13 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council seats held by Sandi Webb and Judy Mikels are on the November 
ballot. Webb has announced her bid for reelection, but Mikels is seeking 
election to the county Board of Supervisors instead. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Federer and Webb, six other Simi Valley residents have pulled 
papers to run for the council. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Douglas K. Dubin, 27, a salesman; Dean F. Kunicki, 49, an insurance 
consultant and Simi Valley planning commissioner; Michael S. Mc Caffrey, an 
insurance underwriter and former president of the Simi Valley Chamber of 
Commerce; Lindsey Paul Miller, 55, former Simi Valley police chief; Gary Robert 
Shaw, 37, and Joseph R. Vesalga, 39, a computer operator and neighborhood 
council director. DARYL KELLEY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; PLANNERS SUPPORT MIXED-USE ZONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark Planning Commission is recommending that the city allow people to 
live above shops and businesses along High Street.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed mixed-use zoning is meant to invigorate the downtown, increase 
the number of affordable rental units and reduce traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "In part it's a functional problem that we're addressing," said Michael 
Wesner, Planning Commission chairman. "To go to work, or to the cleaners or to 
a grocery store, people have to get in their car. This would be a way to 
eliminate all those trips." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted unanimously to forward the zoning change to the City 
Council, which will consider it after the city's Planning Department draws up a 
new plan for the downtown area.  
</P>
<P>
 Wesner said cities all over the country are adopting mixed-use zoning laws as 
a way to refocus activity on downtowns that have been hurt by competition from 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the convenience of living, shopping and working in the same 
area, Wesner said mixed-use zoning had the potential of reducing crime because 
people would not leave the area after hours, providing a watchful eye on the 
area where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Department will spend the next several months drawing up a new 
specific plan for the city's downtown, said Jim Aguilera, director of the 
Community Services Department. The City Council will then decide whether to 
adopt the mixed-use zoning change, Aguilera said. SCOTT HADLY

NEW PLAN TO CUT NUMBER OF FALSE ALARMS INTRODUCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to end months of debate over how to reduce the number of false-alarm 
calls to police, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick proposed a measure 
Tuesday that has the backing of the security alarm industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Chick's proposal, alarm companies would try to call the owners of 
automated residential and commercial alarm systems by telephone to verify the 
need for a police response after an alarm is triggered. 
</P>
<P>
 If a building occupant confirmed that the alarm was triggered accidentally, 
the alarm company would tell police to ignore the call. But if the company 
could not verify whether the call was genuine, police would be dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the latest effort to cut down on the thousands of false-alarm calls that 
police say take valuable time away from real emergencies, and also the most 
recent episode in a long, sometimes complex debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a complaint by an alarm company, which was not identified, to the 
Los Angeles Police Department triggered an internal investigation into 
allegations that officers supplied the City Council with bogus information, 
exaggerating the number of false burglar alarms to ensure the passage of a 
tough ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no word yet on whether the investigation has uncovered any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick offered her measure as a compromise to an ordinance proposed several 
weeks ago by Councilman Marvin Braude, which drew howls of protest from alarm 
industry representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Braude's measure, police would not respond to any alarm calls until a 
break-in was verified by an occupant or the alarm company.  
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Chick's measure would withhold police response to alarm calls proven 
to be false, Braude's proposal would halt all police responses until alarm 
firms verified that the calls were genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 Police backed Braude's proposal, but alarm company representatives said the 
cost of adding security guards or surveillance cameras would make owning an 
alarm system too expensive for many residents and business owners. The average 
monthly fee for a residential system, they said, could jump from $25 to about 
$55. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Nigro, president of the Los Angeles Burglar and Fire Alarm Assn., 
commended Chick's proposal as "a very good starting point" that would not 
increase the cost of owning an alarm system. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the City Council voted to send it to the council's Public Safety 
Committee for further study.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF WEEKEND 
KIDNAPING AND RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's detectives arrested a 23-year-old Oxnard man 
Wednesday on suspicion of kidnaping and raping a 24-year-old woman last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Ramirez was taken into custody at his home at about 7:45 a.m. and 
booked at Ventura County Jail on charges of kidnaping, rape and three counts of 
oral copulation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crimes occurred last Sunday night, investigators said. At about 9 p.m., 
the woman drove to Julian Street in Oxnard to a friend's house and found a 
young man standing there.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman did not know the man's name but had seen him in the area, 
investigators said. She asked the man if he knew where her friend was. He said 
the friend had left and then persuaded the woman to take him to a nearby store. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in her car, the man forced her to drive to an isolated spot on Hueneme 
Road, where he sexually assaulted her, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, the man assaulted her again. Then, at a Camarillo hotel, 
the woman was able to gain the attention of an employee, who telephoned the 
police. The man became suspicious and fled, authorities said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MEXICAN STORMS BRING LIGHT RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forecasters say storms drifting up from the coast of Mexico brought 
unseasonably early rain to parts of Ventura County early Wednesday, although 
the precipitation is not expected to continue through the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Light rain fell sporadically between 4 and 7 a.m., bringing trace amounts to 
Ventura and slightly heavier amounts to the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anything was heavy enough to cause problems, except for slick 
pavement on the road," said National Weather Service forecaster Bruce 
Entwistle. 
</P>
<P>
 Entwistle said the rain resulted from Mexican storms over Sonora and Baja that 
drifted over the Pacific Ocean and north up the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The same thundershowers that brought rain to Ventura County also moved onshore 
in Santa Barbara County and other Southern California coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, Entwistle said, it does not rain in Ventura County until late August 
or September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every now and then storms drift far enough west (from the deserts and Mexico) 
to affect the Ventura County coastline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's forecast calls for mostly clear skies, with some patchy fog. Highs 
should be in the upper 70s along the coast and the lower 90s inland. JULIE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN SENTENCED TO 19 YEARS FOR MURDER OF 
SISTER'S BOYFRIEND

<P>
 An Oxnard man who fatally stabbed his sister's boyfriend in a dispute over a 
car was sentenced to 19 years in state prison on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Culbertson, 24, was sentenced after a judge denied his request to 
withdraw his June 15 guilty pleas to one count of murder and two counts of 
aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Culbertson was scheduled to be sentenced last month, but that hearing was 
postponed after he told the judge he wanted to fire his public defender and 
take back his pleas. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath sentenced Culbertson after a second 
attorney, Willard P. Wiksell, advised the defendant there was no legal basis 
for withdrawing his pleas. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Culbertson for the April slaying of David Rubio, 19, of 
Oxnard. The assault charges stem from a separate attack by Culbertson on his 
girlfriend. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; RAILROAD REQUIRES REPAIRS FOR AMTRAK 
SERVICE

<TEXT>
<P>
 It took an earthquake to get Metrolink service to Camarillo. What will it take 
to get Amtrak? 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink trains began picking up commuters at a temporary station near Lewis 
Road shortly after the Jan. 17 quake.The service is funded with state and 
federal relief money to help ease freeway congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 In May the Ventura County Transportation Commission agreed to spend $25,000 in 
state funds to build a second platform at the station so Amtrak and Metrolink 
trains could arrive and depart simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Southern Pacific Transportation Co., which owns the railroad track and 
right-of-way, said it will not allow both train services to operate at the 
station unless the county installs a train signal and replaces some railroad 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated cost of the improvements is $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, the commission doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a 
station that is considered temporary," commission spokesman Chris Stephens 
said. "For our purposes right now, $125,000 is just too much money." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few weeks, Stephens said, commission members will meet with 
railroad officials to discuss the matter and try to work out a compromise. SARA

 As part of an ongoing statewide project to make bridges more earthquake-safe, 
the California Transportation Commission on Wednesday approved funding to shore 
up four bridges along the Ventura Freeway in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.6-million seismic retrofit project, which is scheduled to begin within 
two months, will include two bridges at the Ventura River and two near the 
Rincon, said Robert Joe, senior construction engineer for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now Caltrans is retrofitting several other bridges in Ventura County. 
They are the Santa Paula Freeway at Wells Road, at Victoria Avenue and at the 
Ventura Freeway; the Ventura Freeway near Seaward Avenue and at San Jon Road; 
the Moorpark Freeway in Thousand Oaks, and the Simi Valley Freeway at Kuehner 
Drive. SARA CATANIA

LOW-INCOME HOUSING NEEDS ON EAST COUNTY CITIES' AGENDAS; SIMI VALLEY: BUILDERS 
SEEK SUBSIDIES. BUT PANEL QUESTIONS WHETHER POOR WOULD BE SERVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two developers are seeking nearly $1 million in city subsidies to build 12 
houses and as many as 40 apartments for low-income Simi Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But city leaders said they want proof that the dwellings would truly be 
affordable for the city's poor residents before they agree to commit city 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In a proposal to the city's affordable housing subcommittee on Wednesday, the 
Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. asked for a $500,000 loan to help build up 
to 40 three- and four-bedroom apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The second developer, Thousand Oaks-based Franklin Z. Greenspan, asked for 
$480,000 in loans to subsidize 12 single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither developer has purchased a site for the housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-family homes would be sold for about $150,000 to families earning 
less than 75% of the county median income, about $40,000 for a family of four. 
The average price of a house in Simi Valley is about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with state guidelines for low-income units, monthly rents for 
the apartments could not exceed $670 for three-bedroom units and $737 for those 
with four bedrooms, Cabrillo spokesman Ralph Lippman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis, who chairs the subcommittee, said those caps may not be 
low enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what the state and federal guidelines are," Davis said in an 
interview. "We need to look at what poor people in our city make and what they 
can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have hundreds of single parents in this city who struggle to raise 
children and pay rent and live a normal life," Davis said. "I'm looking for a 
project with rents that they are going to be able to afford." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Mikels, who also serves on the subcommittee, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm uncomfortable with using city money to help pay for so-called affordable 
projects if people aren't actually going to be able to afford them," Mikels 
said. "To me a reasonable price for an affordable home would be closer to 
$100,000, not $150,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Just where the city would get the nearly $1 million to subsidize the two 
projects is uncertain. No money is available for the next year in the city's 
redevelopment agency account, which usually pays for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan said he would work with the city to come up with a compromise for 
the cost of the houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lippman said Cabrillo would be willing to charge lower rents for the units if 
it could find more money to subsidize the building and maintenance of the 
project, which is expected to cost about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get more subsidy, we can charge lower rents," Lippman said. "Anyone who 
builds this sort of housing agrees that you want to be able to charge as little 
as possible. It just depends on how heavily you are subsidized." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo, the county's largest builder of housing for the poor, has 
constructed dwellings for low-income families in Moorpark, Ojai, Santa Paula, 
Ventura, Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Greenspan gained approval from Simi Valley for a $520,000 loan to 
help build a 32-unit condominium project called Royal Place. Seventeen of those 
units have been purchased by single mothers earning as little as $17,900 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the city has contributed more than $1.8 million in state and 
federal grants and loans to three housing developments for low-income 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest subsidy, $877,000 in loans and grants, went to Heywood Gardens, a 
75-unit senior citizen apartment complex that opened this year. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $721,000 was granted to Cabrillo recently to help pay for the 
construction of 22 three-bedroom duplex units called Apricot Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the help of a $230,000 loan from the city, USA Properties broke 
ground this summer on Las Serenas, a 108-unit senior citizen apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Simi Valley has agreed to subsidize 1,415 so-called affordable 
dwellings, but 415 of those were for families with incomes at or slightly above 
the city's median, which is $55,200 for a family of four.

13-YEAR-OLD BALLPLAYERS SEEK THE BIG TIME; THOUSAND OAKS: THE ALL-STARS WILL 
COMPETE TONIGHT FOR A SPOT IN THE LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES. THE CITY RALLIES 
BEHIND THEM. YOUNGER TEAM COULD WIN STATE TITLE.

<P>
 Pennant fever is building, and the lapel pins and avocados await -- stacked on 
hopes that the Thousand Oaks all-stars will win a slot tonight in the Little 
League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks officials donated the city-logo pins and a Port Hueneme food 
supplier offered the fruit as a symbol of support for a team that has gone 
farther than ever before toward the coveted Little League world championship. 
</P>
<P>
 If Thousand Oaks' 13-year-olds win tonight at the Western Regional game in San 
Jose, they will pass the gifts on in a traditional goodwill offering to their 
opponents in the eight-team series at Taylor, Mich., said team adviser Bill 
Hirsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's very excited," said Hirsh, manager of the West Oaks Baseball 
Club, a year-round Conejo Valley league that has put the 12-member all-star 
team through intensive training for the series. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like a culmination for us," Hirsh said. "We're really starting to get 
a thoroughbred strain of ballplayers in Thousand Oaks. And it's a credit to the 
coaching, because these kids are getting better and better, and it's a credit 
to the community because they're giving the teams the support they need to 
advance." 
</P>
<P>
 City merchants have donated money, equipment and uniforms to the Thousand Oaks 
Little League teams, helping to pay for coaching clinics, pitching coaches and 
off-season training that have turned the 13-year-old team into "a well-oiled 
machine," Hirsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's success has made the city proud, said City Councilwoman Elois 
Zeanah, whom Hirsh called one of the league's strongest supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just excited about their success and about this trip," Zeanah said. "It's 
one more example of the excellent youth programs we have because of our adult 
leaders and youth interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Whealon, the Thousand Oaks Little League's head umpire, praised the city 
for its support of the team. "As I go through the community, the talk is that 
people are very excited," Whealon said. "It's the first time in our history 
that we've done this -- hopefully gone to a world series." 
</P>
<P>
 The 9- to 10-year-old all-stars team also stands to win a championship -- the 
state title -- if its players beat Lakewood in another game tonight. Thousand 
Oaks beat Lakewood 6-4 last week, but lost 5-1 Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are the 13-year-olds' chances? 
</P>
<P>
 As 12-year-olds last year, many of the players on this team beat Long Beach, 
the two-time world champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night's extra-innings 5-4 win over Stockton was a squeaker, but the 
team pulled out the win. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, they will play the winner of Wednesday's game between teams from 
Stockton, Calif., and Pearl City, Hawaii -- teams the boys from Thousand Oaks 
have already beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they win that one, they will become one team among eight in their age 
group that have survived worldwide play among 7,200 teams competing to make the 
Little League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys are not nervous, manager Ed Kitchen said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 'They're just intense, and they just want to win. They've got a lot of heart," 
Kitchen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The players have been training with Mark Davis, a professional pitching coach 
who once hurled in the minors for the New York Mets and the St. Louis 
Cardinals, Kitchen said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have been playing in the off-season, going up against more seasoned 
14- and 15-year-olds in winter games to hone their skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks residents and team sponsors are rooting hard, predicting the 
boys could play their way to the world title after a full year of training.  
</P>
<P>
 "They stand a chance to go all the way," said Matt Goldfield, owner of Big 
League Stuff Sporting Goods in Thousand Oaks. "I know a few of them, and they 
can really play ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Store customers have been buzzing about the team's chances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really excited. It's like the farthest the Thousand Oaks team has 
ever gone," Goldfield said. "Some of the coaches at Thousand Oaks High School 
and Westlake High School are drooling over these kids -- they can't wait till 
they play on the high school teams." 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 years, Manny Ashoori has been serving postgame pizzas to Little 
Leaguers at the Round Table restaurant he manages in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are excited about the Little League team. Every year they try, and 
I hope this year they can get it," Ashoori said. "They worked very hard, and 
they deserve a championship."

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: THIRD WORLD FODDER FOR FIRST WORLD GREED; 
POPULATION PRESSURE OFTEN GETS BLAMED FOR EVILS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH 
BIRTHRATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

publications.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cairo's teeming millions will be augmented early next month by thousands 
participating in the huge U.N. conference on world population and development. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the U.N. environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 did not see the 
contending passions that will be unleashed beside the Nile on Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond such disputes as that between the Vatican and various national 
governments on birth control and abortion are the vast rifts in interest and 
perspective between the First World and the Third, between the rich nations and 
the poor.  
</P>
<P>
 Insight into these fissures is offered by a "Call To Reason" now being 
circulated for signature by Nobel Prize-winners in chemistry, economics, 
literature, medicine, peace and physics. 
</P>
<P>
 At first sight, the "Call" seems straightforward. If current fertility rates 
remain constant, global population is expected to grow from the current 5.7 
billion to 11 billion in 31 years. "The continued growth," the statement says, 
"in the number of people who inhabit this planet will inevitably increase the 
substantial damage that the atmosphere, the water table and the arable soil 
have already suffered."  
</P>
<P>
 To First Worlders this properly evokes the population crisis: burgeoning 
populations in Africa, Latin America and Asia placing impossible burdens on the 
environment. Forests fall, as subsistence farmers slash and burn. The air is 
fouled by forest fires and shantytown stoves. Slum sewage poisons the 
waterways.  
</P>
<P>
 To Third Worlders, the "Call to Reason" is nefariously naive in equating 
population increase with degradation of air, water and arable soil. Indeed, any 
summary of world population problems that does not include consideration of 
world divisions of wealth, First World consumption of resources and global 
corporate economic patterns of exploitation is simple-minded and rightly 
opposed by developing countries.  
</P>
<P>
 To put the issue anecdotally:  
</P>
<P>
 * It is no population explosion that is currently devastating the Indonesian 
forests, but the operations of Japanese logging corporations.  
</P>
<P>
 * One of the most polluted sites on the planet is Cubatao, in Sao Paulo, 
Brazil. It has the most toxic soil, water and air, plus a life expectancy among 
local residents of 32 years. This is a zone developed by subsidiaries of 
international industrial and pharmaceutical companies.  
</P>
<P>
 * Severe soil depletion and water contamination are now occurring in 
California's Central Valley, which is hardly overpopulated.  
</P>
<P>
 In other words, population pressure often gets blamed for evils that have 
nothing to do with birthrates.  
</P>
<P>
 Huge problems are posed by world population growth. But hysteria and 
misallocation of blame will do nothing to alleviate the crisis.  
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of the West African nation of Cameroon. The government of that 
country has just told international conservation groups that in order to 
service its international debt, it will have to cut down its forests. In the 
words of one official, "We can either sell our timber or starve!"  
</P>
<P>
 And so the forests of Cameroon will fall; peasants in the forest will be 
expelled, trek to the cities and add their number to the pool of slum dwellers 
who find no employment in the country's sagging oil industry.  
</P>
<P>
 But the cause will not be overbreeding Cameroonians but the First World banks 
that extort from Africa more capital than they put in.  
</P>
<P>
 It is an axiom among demographers that poverty pushes birthrates up. Economic 
security stabilizes them. When people give up all hope, the birth rate -- as is 
now happening in the former Soviet Union -- can slump drastically.  
</P>
<P>
 And so Third World nations, chastised for their birthrates by the First World, 
retort that any discussion of population must include a realistic agenda for 
economic development. They also say that it behooves First World countries to 
examine their own prodigal wastage of resources and to stop making 
population/resource equations that presume an equality between, say, Germany 
and Chad, as if the inhabitants of each had equal demands on water, soil, 
timber, metals, and so on.  
</P>
<P>
 These are the Third World's arguments against those First World Malthusians at 
Cairo who will be pressing the rapid development of contraceptive vaccines, 
such as have been researched by the New York-based Population Council.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in a world as rich in ethnic strife, social fissures and exploitation 
as ours, the perfection of a quick-fix vaccine for population control is 
nothing but a well-mannered version of Zyklon-B, as used by those wartime 
population-controllers at Auschwitz.

TENNIS / WOMEN AT MANHATTAN BEACH; SHRIVER UPSET IN SECOND ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sabine Appelmans of Belgium was one of four seeded players to win second-round 
matches at the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles on Wednesday, but No. 16 Pam 
Shriver was upset by Elena Likhovtseva of Kazakhstan, 6-0, 3-6, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The second round was scheduled to be completed Wednesday night when defending 
champion Martina Navratilova, seeded second, was to face Alexia 
Dechaume-Balleret of France. 
</P>
<P>
 Appelmans, seeded eighth, overcame a miserable second set to defeat Tami 
Whitlinger-Jones, 6-2, 1-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, No. 10 Amy Frazier rolled past Christina Singer of Germany, 6-1, 
6-2; No. 12 Patty Fendick rallied for a 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory over Laura 
Golarsa of Italy, and No. 15 Kimberly Po breezed past Melissa Mazzotta of 
Venezuela, 6-3, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 In other second-round action, Patricia Hy of Canada eliminated Mercedes Paz of 
Argentina, 6-0, 6-4; Ann Grossman rallied to defeat Asa Carlsson of Sweden, 
5-7, 6-3, 6-4; Sandrine Testud of France topped Maria Jose Gaidano of 
Argentina, 6-3, 6-3, and Angelica Gavaldon downed Kyoko Nagatsuka of Japan, 
6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Paz was added to the draw Tuesday as a replacement for third-seeded Lindsay 
Davenport, who withdrew from the tournament because of a pulled calf muscle in 
her left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Appelmans needed 1 hour 42 minutes to defeat Whitlinger-Jones. After holding 
service on the first game of the second set, Appelmans lost the next six games. 
But she rebounded in the third set, winning the first three games and three of 
the last four. 
</P>
<P>
 Shriver, 32 and ranked 48th in the world, was dominated in the first set by 
Likhovtseva, who is ranked 57th. But Shriver won the second set and the players 
held service in the first 11 games of the third set. Then, Likhovtseva broke 
Shriver to end the 1-hour 47-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried I wasn't going to get into the match," Shriver said. "She 
played well, and she didn't do badly later, either. She came up with the good 
stuff. I had my chances in the middle of the third set, I had her 0-30 in the 
seventh game and 30-30 in the ninth game, and I should have won those games. My 
serve was part of my game that disappointed me. Mentally, she was very tough at 
the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Likhovtseva, 19, said the first set was easy, but then she ran into problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she'd keep the same game, she raised her game," Likhovtseva said. 
"I was afraid I couldn't win the third set. This is my biggest win."

 Top-seeded Sergi Bruguera needed three sets to defeat Russian Andrei 
Cherkasov, 6-1, 2-6, 6-1, on Wednesday in the second round of the $1.72-million 
ATP Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish clay specialist, a three-time winner on that surface this year, 
inherited the top seeding when No. 1-ranked Pete Sampras withdrew late last 
week because of tendinitis in his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden eliminated countryman Henrik Holm, 6-3, 
6-2, avenging a loss to Holm in the first round of the French Open this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Lendl, the one-time No. 1 who flashed some of his old form Monday, 
complained of a sore back and withdrew in the second set of Wednesday's match 
with David Wheaton. Wheaton had won the first set, 7-6 (7-5), and was leading 
2-0 in the second when Lendl, 34, left the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl won the ATP Championship in 1982, the year he won 15 tournaments. He was 
the top-ranked player in the world for 157 weeks from September 1985 to 
September 1988, and is the tour's career earnings leader with more than $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Stoltenberg, unseeded but playing well lately, ousted fifth-seeded 
Andrei Medvedev, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2. Stoltenberg underwent shoulder surgery a year 
ago but has come back stronger than ever and is 22nd in the tour rankings, a 
career high for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg, 24, of Australia, is the hottest player on the ATP tour, winning 
16 of 19 matches in the past four weeks. It was the first hard-court match of 
the year for Medvedev, of Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos Mansdorf of Israel upset 10th-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 
6-3, 6-3.

<P>
 Pat Quinn, stressing he wanted to give more attention to his front-office 
jobs, reluctantly stepped down as coach of the Vancouver Canucks Wednesday and 
handed the position to assistant Rick Ley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ley is a former teammate of Quinn's who has been a Canuck assistant for three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vancouver coaching change had been anticipated for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn was hired as the Canucks' general manager and president in 1987. He 
appointed himself coach during the 1990-91 season, replacing Bob McCammon. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining the Canucks, Ley, 45, was coach of the Hartford Whalers for two 
seasons, and he coached the IHL's Muskegon Lumberjacks to four consecutive 
first-place finishes. JIM HODGES

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BAGWELL BREAKS HAND IN ASTROS' VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell broke a bone in his left hand, but Steve Finley homered and 
Darryl Kile pitched six strong innings Wednesday night to help Houston defeat 
San Diego, 3-1, at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell, the major league leader with 116 runs batted in, was removed in the 
fifth inning after being hit on the left hand by a pitch from Andy Benes in the 
third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken to a hospital for X-rays, which revealed a fracture in the fourth 
metacarpal of his left hand. Bagwell is expected to need three to five weeks to 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell also had his hitting streak stopped at 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Kile (9-6) did not allow a runner past first base after the third inning but 
was removed after hitting Craig Shipley with a pitch with one out in the 
seventh. Todd Jones pitched 2 2/3 innings for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gwynn went one for four with a single for San Diego and is batting .391. 
</P>
<P>
 Benes (6-14), who has lost five decisions in his last seven starts, struck out 
nine, extending his NL strikeout lead to 189. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 4, Pittsburgh 0 -- Pedro Martinez (11-5) beat the Pirates quickly and 
quietly, pitching six-hit ball over 8 2/3 innings as the streaking Expos scored 
their 20th victory in 22 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquis Grissom homered to start a three-run third inning as the Expos set a 
franchise record with their ninth consecutive road victory. Montreal's 42-19 
road record is the best in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wetteland got the final out for his third save in as many nights and his 
25th this season. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 5, Chicago 2 -- Matt Williams, his chase of Roger Maris' home 
run record jeopardized by the impending strike, hit No. 43 and added a two-run 
double as the Giants beat the Cubs in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third, after two walks and a single loaded the bases, Williams doubled 
for a 3-0 lead, giving him 96 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 William VanLandingham (8-2) got the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Beck finished for his 28th save and his 40th in a row dating to last Aug. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 1, Atlanta 0 -- Kevin Ritz and Steve Reed combined to shut out 
Atlanta through six innings and the Rockies earned their first home victory 
over the Braves in a game called after six innings because of rain in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Bichette's double brought in the only run in the game, which was called 
after a 1-hour, 25-minute rain delay. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the first for the Rockies over Atlanta at Mile High Stadium, 
after 11 consecutive losses. Atlanta leads the all-time series, 20-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritz (5-6) blanked Atlanta for 5 2/3 innings, giving up six hits with five 
walks and six strikeouts. Loser Tom Glavine (13-9) gave up only four hits. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 12, Florida 4 -- Omar Olivares pitched seven innings and hit his 
third career homer, helping the Cardinals win in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Pagnozzi hit a two-run homer and Olivares (3-4) followed with a solo homer 
in the sixth to knock out Dave Weathers (8-12), who lost his fifth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 6, Philadelphia 2 -- Joe Orsulak singled in the go-ahead run in a 
three-run, eighth-inning rally that sent Bret Saberhagen and the Mets to a 
victory over the Phillies in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberhagen (14-4) gave up one run and six hits in 7 1/3 innings. John Franco 
earned his NL-leading 30th save.

 Procter & Gamble Reports Record Profit: Signaling a clear rebound after a 
year-old restructuring, the nation's largest maker of household and personal 
care products announced a record full-year profit and strong quarterly results. 
The Cincinnati-based company's fiscal earnings surged to a record $2.2 billion 
after a loss of $656 million a year ago, when results were depressed by the 
$1.5-billion restructuring charge and accounting changes. Procter & Gamble made 
a worldwide profit of $406 million in its fourth quarter, contrasted with a 
year-ago loss of $1.2 billion, excluding the restructuring charge.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BLUE CHIPS EDGE HIGHER; BOND YIELDS STEADY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stock prices edged higher Wednesday, buoyed by drug and semiconductor issues, 
but bond yields held steady after the second leg of the Treasury's quarterly 
refunding attracted moderate demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller-company Nasdaq index, heavily weighted in computer, semiconductor 
and other technology stocks, soared 5.59 points, or 0.77%, to 728.20. 
Technology issues also rose on other indexes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 11 points to 3,766.76 on Big Board 
volume totaling 279.50 million shares, up from 259.03 million on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 5 to 4 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology stocks have taken a beating recently and their prices are 
relatively low, said James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stocks that have been pushed down the most are coming back," he said. 
"The market is doing better and people are looking for bargains." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong second-quarter corporate earnings reports have helped technology issues 
in recent days, said John Jones, a technology analyst at Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 22 technology stocks he covers, 82% met or exceeded expectations for 
the quarter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the profit increases over the same period last year are 
significant, Jones said. Of the issues, 46% showed increases of 40% or more and 
36% showed gains of between 10% and 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Strength in technology shares helped overcome the uneasiness weighing on 
stocks in recent sessions that was prompted by Friday's stronger-than-expected 
July employment report. 
</P>
<P>
 That, and concern about data on July retail sales and inflation due out on 
today and Friday, has prompted speculation that the Federal Reserve Board might 
nudge interest rates higher for a fifth time this year. Analysts believe such a 
move could follow Tuesday's meeting of the central bank's policy-making panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The apprehension had also dampened enthusiasm for the Treasury Department's 
three-phase financing operation this week. The Treasury sold $17 billion of 
three-year notes Tuesday and $12 billion of 10-year notes Wednesday, and it 
will sell $11 billion of 30-year bonds today. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's auction of new 10-year Treasury notes was uneventful and met 
decent demand from investors, according to market analysts. The average yield 
on the notes was 7.33%, about as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, bond yields retreated somewhat following the auction, pushing down 
credit market interest rates. Stock investors like to see rates fall because 
that cuts the cost of money to companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, prices of short-term bonds led a broader advance Wednesday 
as the market absorbed the second wave of the new refinancing operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The main 30-year bond yield closed unchanged at 7.57%, while its price edged 
up 1/32 point, or 31 cents per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 But Treasury bills posted sharper improvements as buyers of the short-term 
securities emerged following the afternoon auction of about $12 billion in 
10-year bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short- and intermediate-term Treasury securities ranged from 3/32 
point to 1/8 point higher, the Telerate Inc. financial information service 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, stocks abroad ended mostly lower. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share 
average ended up 180.03 points at 20,770.25; Frankfurt's DAX 30-share average 
closed at 2,160.37, down 3.83 points, and London's Financial Times 100-share 
average fell 1.6 points to 3,167. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index fell 20.299 points to 2574.67. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks 
rose 2.37 points to 460.30, while the NYSE's composite index jumped 1.24 to 
254.20. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the semiconductor group, Micron Technology rose 3 1/4 to a new high of 42 
1/4, Motorola gained 1/2 to 54 and Texas Instruments jumped 3 3/4 to 84. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in technologies, Hewlett-Packard added 2 1/2 to 82 1/4, networking 
stock Cabletron Systems rose 2 1/4 to 101 7/8 and Lotus Development rose 4 5/8 
to 40 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell Computer rose 1 3/4 to 32 3/4, a 52-week high, amid hopes for its new 
portable computer and expectations that the company will report strong 
second-quarter earnings later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the drug group, Upjohn rose 1 3/4 to 35 1/2, Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 
1 3/8 to 55 5/8 and Merck jumped 1 3/8 to 32 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Cyanamid, the object of American Home Products' $95-a-share offer, 
ended unchanged at 93 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 New York State Electric & Gas was a big loser, dropping 4 5/8 to 20 7/8. The 
company said it does not expect to earn its allowed return. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dillard Department Stores fell 4 7/8 to 26 5/8. The retailer announced 
disappointing second-quarter earnings of 30 cents a share, compared to 35 cents 
in the same three months last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lam Research rose 2 7/8 to 36 1/8. The company on Tuesday announced sharply 
higher earnings. 
</P>
<P>

Focus One stock of the week. 
</P>
<P>

fiscal fourth-quarter loss of 12 cents a share, compared to a loss of $2.63 in 
the same three months last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ericsson Telephone fell 1 3/8 to 53 3/4 after Merrill Lynch downgraded the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar held steady as investors awaited the July inflation 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar was quoted at 101.35 Japanese yen, up from 101.28 on 
Tuesday. The dollar closed at 1.584 German marks, up from 1.582.

BEDTIME STORIES FOR THESE OH-SO PC TIMES; BOOKS: JAMES FINN GARNER TWEAKS THE 
LANGUAGE POLICE WITH HIS REWORKING OF CLASSIC TALES FOR THE AGE DEFICIENT 
(TRANSLATION: KIDS). AND THEY'RE SELLING LIKE THERMALLY BOOSTED FLOUR PATTIES 
(THAT'S 'HOT CAKES' TO MOST OF US). 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By RUSSELL MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Goldilocks is a biologist hoping to hang radio collars on anthropomorphic 
bears. The Three Little Pigs become porcinistas , vanquishing an imperialist 
glutton of a wolf. Chicken Little gets tied up in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 And a little book showcasing these tales flies off bookstore shelves faster 
than Jack could climb an organic beanstalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The bits about Goldilocks, pigs and poultry come from "Politically Correct 
Bedtime Stories," a pocket-sized volume by James Finn Garner (Macmillan, 1994). 
But the part about the book itself is no fairy tale. This summer, shoppers have 
been snapping up Garner's satire at a rate no publisher would have dared 
predict. 
</P>
<P>
 More jocular than Grimm, Garner presents postmodern, revisionist, 
tongue-in-cheek takes on 13 children's classics, from a Red Riding Hood 
confident in her budding sexuality to three co-dependent goats gruff. He tweaks 
ecologists, feminists, the men's movement and the recovery movement, not to 
mention real estate developers and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's going to stick up for lawyers," Garner says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, his stories savage those who try to fix the world by fixing thought 
and language. He parodies opponents of sexism, ageism and a bunch of other 
-isms he invents just for fun, strewing his pages with their euphemisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are all too commonplace: "economically disadvantaged," "patriarchal," 
"differently abled." Others are wittily over-the-top. A mean witch comes out as 
"kindness impaired." Hot porridge is "thermally enhanced." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the jokes, Garner says, lurks a real concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is true that language affects the way we think," he says, "but it's taken 
a really goofy turn. Changing from retarded to developmentally disabled -- has 
this helped the people who are afflicted? I'd argue probably not." 
</P>
<P>
 Garner's takeoffs also take on what he sees as the politicization of 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read about a newsletter for kindergarten teachers telling them not to read 
'Snow White' or 'Cinderella' because of the sexism involved," he recalls, "and 
if they did read one, to try to make the children think critically, but also 
make them feel bad for liking the story." He calls that unfair to children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone was ever made into a wife-beater because they heard 
'Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater,' " he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner, 33, describes himself as "5 feet, 8 inches of rippling flab, melanin 
impoverished." (That means white. Jargon can be catching.) 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in a middle-class home outside Detroit, he graduated from the 
University of Michigan, then moved to Chicago, where he entered a profession 
that offered credibility beyond class or race. "I'm a writer," he says. "I'm 
definitely disenfranchised." 
</P>
<P>
 Before "Politically Correct Bedtime Stories," his major publication was a 
Christmas story in the Chicago Tribune's Sunday magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Garner joined the Theater of the Bizarre, a cabaret comedy troupe. 
Its sketches included bleak nursery rhymes entitled "Kafka for Kinder" and the 
"Teamsters Children's Puppet Theatre" -- "like a violent version of 'Roseanne,' 
" he explains, "except with puppets." 
</P>
<P>
 The bedtime stories began as readings in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked over these stories to get every little nook and cranny, if there was 
a joke in there," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It took about three months to finish the book, about 30 rejections to find a 
publisher. Editors liked his work but marketing departments didn't know how to 
sell it. The happy ending began with an editor at Macmillan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got it on a Monday and by the next week, we had a contract," Garner 
recalls. "He knew to keep it under 10 bucks, so it's an impulse buy or a gift 
item." 
</P>
<P>
 First printing, in May, was 40,000. By August, more than 200,000 copies were 
in print. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Buckley, the satirical novelist whose "Thank You For Smoking" 
(Random House, 1994) breaches another fashionable taboo, sees "subtle cultural 
conservatism" in Garner's stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the tremendous sales of a book like this show that people are 
basically fed up with PC," Buckley says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garner insists he's no conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made fun of things I believe in strongly just because I thought it would 
be funny," he says. Those include U.S. policy in Latin America, theme of his 
"Three Little Pigs," and the tyranny of fashion, his theme in "Cinderella." 
</P>
<P>
 He calls Rush Limbaugh a bully, Dan Quayle a puppet. He even had second 
thoughts about publishing his "Snow White" parody in Playboy, he says, "but I 
figured I'll never get in Playboy again, so I decided to give it a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not against social change; I'm against orthodoxy. It's kind of a litmus 
test among certain left-wingers that you have to fight for sexual equality and 
racial equality and social equality and animal rights and nonviolence and 
everything else, and if you don't adhere to every one of those, you're a 
morally suspect person," Garner says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some folklore scholars believe Garner's parodies clumsily confuse the excesses 
of so-called PC language with legitimate attempts to fight stereotyping in 
children's stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "The classic fairy tales reflect values concerning gender, standards of 
beauty, success and materialism that deeply affect young children and often 
condition their lives," says Judith Pasamanick, who heads the National 
Endowment for the Humanities Folklore Institute at New York's Bank Street 
College of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Other writers have revised stories thoughtfully, she says, but Garner "tosses 
out the baby with the bath." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Zipes, a professor at the University of Minnesota, studies fairy tales 
and their social meaning. He cites a thousand versions of Cinderella catalogued 
since 1890, each with its ideological cast, and calls Garner naive to write as 
if traditional versions were apolitical. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he's doing is as old as fairy tales," Zipes says. "He has a nice 
gimmicky touch, and he's hitting the political backlash against the left and 
the liberals, playing into that market and doing it well." 
</P>
<P>
 Garner knows some think him a reactionary or a dupe. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was obviously a concern of mine when I was writing the book," he says. 
"I don't want to become fodder for a bunch of people I don't agree with." He's 
been bracing himself for an upcoming radio interview with G. Gordon Liddy, 
ex-Watergate spook, who he suspects will portray his stories as "a right-wing 
bible to make fun of the PC movement." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the PC backlash is white guys who'd rather their wives didn't work. 
That's for real," Garner says. "But that's not me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Success has Garner working on a sequel, plus a slew of other projects. 
"Suddenly," he says, "people are returning my calls." 
</P>
<P>
 He envisions an animated version of "Politically Correct Bedtime Stories." He 
might even dust off his unpublished children's books, including one about 
"Arthur the Orphaned Amoeba," who gobbles up a human dad and takes over his 
roles. (No one notices the change.) 
</P>
<P>
 He expects children will prefer his amoeba to "Politically Correct Bedtime 
Stories." A TV show had him read from his bestseller "to kids at a day-care 
center -- and they gave me the blankest looks," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It illustrates the point. When you tack big political, social things onto 
children's stories, they know they're being preached to. They'd just as soon 
hear a good story."

familiar on restaurant menus as ono, is even faster. It's been clocked at 47 
mph, which perhaps explains the ono's other name: the wahoo. CHARLES PERRY

AMERICA'S BEST: FROM KING ARTHUR'S KITCHEN 
</P>

 Buttermilk powder used to be available on supermarket shelves, but for some 
inexplicable reason it's now as difficult to come by as a box of kosher salt. 
Liquid buttermilk is readily available in supermarkets, but who wants to buy a 
quart of it just to bake a few biscuits? 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to King Arthur, America's oldest flour company, biscuit-making can be 
as simple as it used to be. Through its Baker's Catalogue, the 203-year-old 
flour company will ship the dry buttermilk and other difficult-to-find baking 
ingredients, including bulk baking chocolate, barley malt, seeds, vanilla beans 
and extracts, nut butters and pastes, and imported glace fruits and peels.  
</P>
<P>
 Located an hour and half southwest of Burlington, Vt., King Arthur is also one 
of the best sources in the country for bread-baking supplies -- about 1,000 
packages a day are shipped from the company warehouse in Wilder, a short 
distance from Norwich. Serious bread bakers will find everything needed to 
produce crusty loaves: dough-rising buckets, proofing baskets, instant-read 
thermometers, starter jars, baguette pans and many types of flour and grain. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices range from $4.95 for five pounds of golden buffalo (an organic 
stone-ground wheat flour containing the germ but with the bran removed) to 
$3.25 for 1 1/4 pounds of spelt (a primitive form of wheat) to $9.95 for a lame 
, the nifty gadget French bakers use to slash the top crust in a baguette. And, 
of course, there's the dried buttermilk for $4.50 a pound.

TABLE TALK; POLICY MAKER; ELLEN HAAS: A BELTWAY OUTSIDER MOVES INSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer is the most peaceful season here in the midst of Mendocino County's 
vineyards and orchards, as fruit matures to the verge of ripeness and little 
work needs to be done until harvest. The July heat slows life down as well, 
adding to the stillness. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Haas, however, doesn't have time for reveries or solitude. At the moment 
she is involved in debating the weighty issues of the food world: nutrition, 
affordability, sustainable agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion: a gathering of top chefs, environmentalists and consumer 
activists. The place: Fetzer Vineyards' state-of-the-art organic garden and 
culinary center known as Valley Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 But midway through a session on improving children's diets, Haas reluctantly 
bolts out of the meeting room. An assistant has just reminded her that it is 
time for yet another appointment on this one-week visit to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranking U.S. Department of Agriculture officials do not normally mix with 
chefs, organic farmers and winemakers on the latter's home territory. 
Traditionally, these interests are in conflict as the USDA routinely promotes 
-- and favors -- conventional farming represented by the nation's massive grain 
interests and meat industries. 
</P>
<P>
 But Haas, the USDA's Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, is 
the kind of government official who has been willing to defy bureaucratic 
convention. (Americans may remember the USDA's Food and Consumer Services as 
the agency that attempted to classify ketchup as a vegetable during the Reagan 
Administration.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Why am I here?" She answers her own question. "Well, we have a magnificent 
opportunity to dramatically change the health of children through our school 
lunch initiative. And central to the proposal is to improve the taste of food 
served to kids. Chefs can be partners with USDA in helping us make the change . 
. . because if cafeteria food doesn't look good, children won't eat it."  
</P>
<P>
 Haas takes exception to any suggestion that attending an organic farming 
conference complete with gourmet meals and vintage wines is elitist or 
inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are far from being fancy. They roll up their sleeves. They get 
their hands dirty. And vineyards are a part of American agriculture," she says. 
"We can't make the changes we have proposed with just the traditional interests 
who have dominated the policy arena in the past. We will meet with all 
interests. . . . And being here also helps to get out of the bureaucratic 
vacuum (in Washington)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Haas is one of the most powerful women executives in the Clinton 
Administration, overseeing programs with an annual budget of $39 billion 
covering food stamps, the National School Lunch Program and the Women, Infants 
and Children nutrition program (WIC). 
</P>
<P>
 Haas, in fact, is fond of saying that one in six Americans is touched by the 
USDA feeding programs under her control: 27 million Americans receive food 
stamps, another 25 million children receive federally subsidized school lunches 
or breakfasts, and seven million women are enrolled in WIC. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala's $286 billion budget 
eclipses Haas' total among major federal agencies or departments currently run 
by women. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early stages of the Clinton Administration, Shalala, Attorney General 
Janet Reno, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary and Environmental Protection Agency 
Administrator Carol Browner were among the women who became recognizable 
Washington personalities. Not Haas -- agriculture and food issues normally take 
a back seat in the national news cycle. But she is raising her profile 
dramatically by changing the philosophy behind the cornerstones of America's 
anti-hunger programs with an emphasis on healthy eating rather than just 
feeding.  
</P>
<P>
 And Haas' path to the USDA is different from that traveled by virtually all 
her colleagues in the executive branch -- women or men. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen months ago, Haas made the unlikely jump from shoestring consumer 
gadfly to top federal official. At the time, she traded in her dingy office at 
Public Voice for Food & Health Policy, a Washington-based advocacy group, for a 
palatial corner suite at the USDA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The move from firebrand to administrator overseeing a multibillion-dollar 
budget is unusual even for the federal government's revolving doors. Consumer 
groups are rarely, if ever, the proving ground for big-time Republican -- or 
Democratic -- appointees. More likely, the pinnacle for consumer advocates is a 
few minutes on network television attacking the vested interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Haas seems perfectly suited to her post. She has worked in and around 
Washington her entire career. In a sense, she is a Beltway insider who has made 
a living as an outsider, a self-appointed advocate for a long list of consumer 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has a ready explanation for those who say she was not qualified to 
jump from a $1-million-a-year consumer-advocacy operation to her current 
responsibilities and huge budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The measure of a person who does public policy is getting results and making 
a difference for people," Haas says. "At Public Voice I was able to expend 
small financial resources to help consumers on major issues such as beef 
grading, seafood inspection, nutrition labeling. We did that by identifying the 
issues, documenting, researching, and then communicating about them. To have 
had to manage on small resources is beneficial; there is an appreciation of 
frugality in a time of deficit reduction. And I am able to make do with less." 
</P>
<P>
 Haas has impeccable credentials as a consumer advocate. She was elected to 
five terms as president of the Consumer Federation of America and 10 terms as 
vice president. At Public Voice, she was instrumental in changing the 
government's beef grading program so that lean meats received a more palatable 
classification. Changing the name to USDA Select Grade resulted in a 400% 
increase in sales. Prior to founding Public Voice, she was consumer director 
for the Community Nutrition Institute in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 To suit her government tenure, Haas has modified the tactics she successfully 
employed as a consumerist. She is now more consensual than confrontational, a 
bridge builder instead of a barn burner -- cautious instead of a risk taker. 
When necessary, however, she remains especially skilled at using the media to 
facilitate her agenda -- now the Clinton agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Slim, fit and the same weight as at Forest Hills High School in New York City, 
Haas, 54, is immaculately tailored, often in vividly colored business suits. 
She wears her jet-black hair straight and down to the shoulders. She laughs 
when retelling how often people are surprised at her trim appearance, 
expecting, instead, that the person in charge of the nation's school lunch 
program should be "some 250-pound bureaucrat with a hair net." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1982 to 1993, Haas was founder and executive director of Public Voice. 
The group's priorities included food safety -- such as the need for a 
mandatory, comprehensive seafood inspection program -- and nutrition. 
Interestingly, Haas was a frequent critic of the food stamp, school lunch and 
WIC programs that she now administers. School lunches, she said, were too high 
in fat and sodium, food stamps were inaccessible to the rural poor, and not 
enough low-income women were enrolled in WIC to improve pre- and post-natal 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon her USDA appointment, food industry representatives openly feared she 
would immediately turn long-standing government nutrition policy upside-down. 
They were wrong. She still needs more time. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 8, Haas and USDA Secretary Mike Espy announced that the Clinton 
Administration plans to reduce fat content in federally subsidized school 
lunches to 30% of total calories. Saturated fat will be reduced to only 10% of 
total calories. Sodium counts must also be modified. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes may mean a dramatic reformulation of school cafeteria food. Fried 
chicken, hamburgers and pizza are likely to be supplanted in lunch rooms by 
more fresh produce, pasta, bread and seafood. The emphasis on reduced-fat diets 
for school children earned Haas the derisive name of "National Nanny" by one 
meat industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the proposal is the first significant revision of school lunch 
nutrition requirements in half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas, a one-time history teacher, researched the National School Lunch 
Program, which dates to the 1940s, before the proposal was issued. The idea for 
federally subsidized meals arose during the Truman Administration after an 
alarming number of young men were rejected for World War II military service 
because of nutritional deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the decades since, undernutrition has lessened while overconsumption has 
become the major health problem, she says.  
</P>
<P>
 "Diet is related to at least half of all the major chronic diseases, and 
adults acquire their eating habits by age 12," Haas said as a way of 
emphasizing the importance of school lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even in its current form, the proposed USDA changes did not satisfy some 
of Haas' biggest supporters, including those at her former consumer group, 
Public Voice. Chief among the complaints are that the proposal, as announced, 
does not go into effect until July, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas responds by saying there is still time to make changes -- including the 
starting date -- before a final regulation is issued and that the 
public-comment period on the Clinton school lunch plan does not close until 
September 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an initially chilly reception from food industry groups, Haas has 
thrived at the USDA and may soon get a promotion and new title. Legislation is 
pending in Congress that, in addition to a major reorganization of the USDA, 
would elevate Haas' current position to undersecretary. 
</P>
<P>
 The change is not mere window dressing but more accurately reflects the fact 
that Haas' Food and Consumer Services represents about 60% of the USDA's total 
annual budget. Furthermore, the programs she administers have either retained 
their present funding or were actually increased in the 1995 federal budget -- 
a significant accomplishment for any agency, but particularly so at athe USDA 
where major budget and staff reductions are expected in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 While 16 months as assistant secretary has not dampened Haas' energy, it has 
softened her rhetoric. Sniping doesn't work when major speeches need to be 
cleared through Agriculture Secretary Espy's office and, on some occasions, by 
the policy staff at the Clinton White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm comfortable in my role," she says back in her Washington office during a 
recent interview. "Everyone (at this level) has their speeches approved and I 
have been very comfortable with that from Day 1 and I am comfortable being part 
of the team. . . . I need to keep focused on the purpose of this job, and that 
is to improve the health of children, not to criticize." 
</P>
<P>
 Her scripted remarks parallel the Clinton Administration's philosophy of 
reinventing government and reforming health care. But when speaking 
extemporaneously, as she did at a press conference earlier this year in San 
Diego, Haas may resort to the language of consumer champion on food safety 
issues, her prime focus at Public Voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an inadequate system of consumer protection for seafood. The bottom 
line is that we (the federal government) are not doing enough to protect 
consumers," Haas says. "Whether we are serving fish, meat or diary foods to 
kids in school lunch, we must ensure that they are healthy foods. (The USDA) is 
a stake holder in (food safety) problems. . . . The USDA spends $700 million a 
year in food purchases (that are then distributed) for school lunch and that 
makes us a big and important consumer. Our views need to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, on other food safety controversies she equivocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her view was different as a consumer advocate, Haas says that serving 
school children milk from cows treated with the recombinant Bovine Growth 
Hormone drug, or BGH, is not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "BGH was approved by FDA and there is nothing indicating that it is unsafe," 
she now says. "Milk is a major component of school lunch but it is not vital. 
There is no reason for us to get involved with the (science) in any additional 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for irradiated foods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She says that government departments such as hers must rely on companion 
regulatory agencies to investigate and approve new technologies. "These are 
Food and Drug Administration issues and we have to assume that the FDA does an 
objective review." 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 years as a consumer advocate, Haas has gained a feel for politics and 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first issue I was ever involved with as a grass-roots volunteer with the 
Maryland Citizens Council didn't get to first base," she says. "But persistence 
paid off. You need to put in time in order to achieve your goals. . . . After 
all this time, I have an understanding of history and politics and making 
government work for consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the first issue of her activist career was campaigning for 
improvements in the nutritional content of school lunch after she saw what her 
two children were eating in their elementary school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 A former colleague, Rod Leonard of the Community Nutrition Institute, calls 
Haas an efficient administrator, both in and out of government. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has done a great job building her organization," he says. "And she has 
demonstrated her true great qualities: She is a tremendous organizer and has an 
ego as wide as the Mississippi River." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Haas would only say: "Rod (Leonard) is a fine person. . . . We 
have a cordial relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Haas was among the first consumer advocates to enlist many of the nation's top 
chefs in support of programs to promote food safety and children's nutrition. 
She also carefully courted the national media and the important players on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, she moves freely within the circles of celebrity chefs, 
journalists and politicians, whether in Los Angeles, New York or Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, previous inhabitants of her office were more likely to be former 
presidential campaign workers or others heavily influenced by the Washington 
school of partisan politics. Though responsible for the nation's largest 
feeding programs, prior assistant secretaries were more concerned with pleasing 
food industry constituents than discussing, say, the need to reduce pesticide 
residues in school lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 "In previous administrations, food and nutrition issues were made in a vacuum 
as if they had no relation at all to public health. . . . I am trying to build 
bridges from the farms to the schools and chefs," Haas says. "Consumers did 
have a stake in agriculture policy (in previous administrations) but they were 
looked at as intruders. Now, we make sure that consumers participate in all 
policy matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Haas says her work with chefs, which continues in the aggressive campaign to 
improve the nutritional content of school lunches, is not a gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Using chefs was a very smart move," says Will Greenwood, executive chef at 
the Jefferson Hotel in Washington and one of three finalists for the Clinton 
White House chef. "Chefs are a viable and overlooked source of knowledge about 
foodstuffs and are always out trying to find the best quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwood, who enlisted in Haas' Public Voice campaigns to improve seafood 
safety, adds: "She is very forceful in all her issues and she strikes where it 
hurts. . . . I knew I was being used (for publicity purposes) but that was fine 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates need to rely on the media to present their cases, and Haas 
was a master of accumulating coverage without resorting to the sensationalism 
of some of her consumerist colleagues. Her recognition of the media's growing 
interest in food is also reflected in ongoing negotiations with the Walt Disney 
Co. to produce television programming designed to improve children's eating 
habits and food choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are intimidated and afraid of the media but I've always been 
comfortable with it," she says. "The only way to reach the general public is 
through the media. And I have valued that ever since realizing that the media 
allows you to reach consumers in their homes without external distractions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in a series of four hearings across the country last year held to 
get public input on ways of improving school lunch, Haas was able to call on 
her chef contacts, such as California's Alice Waters, to testify. Indeed, 
Waters can speak eloquently to the importance of child nutrition but she is 
also guaranteed to generate media interest in an otherwise dreadfully dull 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 "The skills I learned in working with Congress and the media are invaluable in 
this job," Haas says. "You need to communicate with, and respect, the media and 
Congress. There are major organizations (in Washington) that don't do either 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 No group suffered the consequences of Haas' media savvy more than the National 
Fisheries Institute Inc., a seafood industry trade association in Arlington, 
Va. For years, Clare Vanderbeek, an institute vice president, was assigned to 
follow Haas around the country to act as a one-person spin squad whenever Haas 
was to speak on seafood issues. The confrontations were often mismatches. 
</P>
<P>
 In a terse comment, Vanderbeek recently stated: "Ellen Haas is extremely 
skillful when it comes to bringing media attention to nutrition and food safety 
issues. Her leadership at Public Voice was instrumental in getting a better 
seafood inspection program." 
</P>
<P>
 On a personal level, Haas is knowledgeable about fine food and California 
wine. Family dinners, she says, were important when she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember when I was 8 years old and my mom always made it a habit to 
have stalks of carrots and celery in a glass of cold water at the dinner table. 
And we always started dinner with half a grapefruit in the winter and some 
melon in the summer. . . . Today, I don't cook that much but I try to make 
wonderful things when I do. Food is something to enjoy, something to share. It 
reflects family. And when you eat in a way to promote health, then you are 
enhancing the personal health of the family."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Twice married, Haas is now divorced, with two grown children who will both be 
entering graduate school this fall. Daughter Lisa will attend USC's masters' 
degree program in Physical Therapy and son Jason will begin the University of 
Michigan's MBA program. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has strong opinions on single motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The view that society couldn't succeed unless there is a nuclear family 
irritates me. It's chauvinistic. . . . The family is very important, obviously. 
Yet, the value of family and the value of nurturing doesn't mean that people 
without kids, or unmarried people, are not good . . . but I'm not a militant 
about it," she says. "I don't like to put anyone in boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 As for life beyond the USDA, she says: "I don't think about my future; I'm not 
doing this job to build a career. Right now, I couldn't be more challenged, and 
I believe we have an opportunity to accomplish a great deal."

NEWS MAKER; MIKE ESPY FIGHTS BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing an investigation by a special prosecutor, Agriculture Secretary Mike 
Espy has changed tactics. Rather than reaching out to competing food industry 
and consumer groups, he recently lashed out at those he sees as trying to 
undermine his efforts to modernize the nation's troubled meat and poultry 
inspection program. He also says that efforts to cut the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's massive budget and staff have been stymied as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The combativeness comes at a time when Attorney General Janet Reno has 
petitioned for the appointment of an independent prosecutor to determine 
whether Espy violated the Meat Inspection Act of 1907 when he accepted travel 
and entertainment from Tyson Foods, Inc., the nation's largest poultry 
processor. Espy later reimbursed the company for the hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times before Reno's petition, Espy charged that 
former and present USDA officials resisted his directions to adopt scientific 
procedures for meat inspection, that opponents in the meat industry planted 
false stories in the media about his USDA tenure and that former USDA officials 
were complacent in the face of deaths linked to contaminated hamburger on the 
Pacific Coast in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 During the interview, Espy directed his harshest comments at H. Russell Cross, 
the former Administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to change personnel to get where we are now," he said. "I had to 
dismiss some people from the FSIS agency. . . . Let me state that more 
accurately: I decided not to extend the contract of a gentleman who used to be 
the administrator (Cross). We had several problems with his ability to carry 
forth the agenda of this Administration as it relates to food-borne (illnesses) 
and to meat and poultry inspection. He no longer works here. . . . And he has 
been very critical since he left here and even untruthful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Espy said Cross and Wilson Horne, a now-retired FSIS official, were among 
several USDA employees who were complacent in the face of illnesses and deaths 
attributed to contaminated hamburger in several Western states in January, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gathered the leadership of the Food Safety and Inspection Service . . . and 
I got the impression that they knew about these deaths and they weren't 
excited. They considered the deaths acceptable," Espy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross, currently director of the Institute for Food Science and Engineering at 
Texas A&M University, would not respond to Espy's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite internal opposition, Espy said that the USDA was still able to launch 
70 initiatives to improve the nation's meat and poultry inspection program. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the recent action, such as a pathogen reduction plan that was 
announced last week, has irked the food industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been criticized by industry for going too far," he said. "It is really 
ironic. . . . Last year they complimented me on how we intervened in the E. 
coli case and we were being roundly applauded by the industry for arresting 
what could have been a dangerous slide in consumer confidence in regard to 
(beef). 
</P>
<P>
 "And now, as we try to improve their products even more so -- which would 
guarantee a greater confidence in the consumer sector -- we are being 
criticized (by the same people). . . . When I say we have the safest food 
supply in the world . . . that part of what I say is what they like. But when I 
say it can be made safer still -- that is what they don't like." 
</P>
<P>
 Espy said his critics in the food industry have been responsible for some of 
the negative press coverage he has received in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 19 months, we have clearly made food safer," he said. "I stand without any 
fear of contradiction. But that has not come without (financial) costs to some 
people and to some industries. Some can accept it and some won't accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made changes at the USDA in our personnel and in the attitude that we 
would like to instill in our personnel. Some don't want to do that and some 
protest and some target me. They have connections with writers and they plant 
stories. There was a story that I had ordered the destruction of documents 
(related to proposed tough new regulations for chicken processors). This is the 
USDA, not the CIA. I guess we have a shredder in here somewhere but I have not 
used it nor ordered it used. That (story was) patently untrue. But (the 
allegation) causes an (FBI) investigation and so, perhaps, the investigation 
itself is the purpose. Hopefully, it won't knock us off stride. I can't let 
that happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Espy also had harsh words for consumer groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been criticized by the consumer side for not moving fast enough (on 
improving meat inspection)," he said. "(And the complaints) have come from 
people who worked in prior (Presidential) Administrations that didn't do 
anything much (about the problems)." 
</P>
<P>
 Espy was referring primarily to Carol Tucker Foreman, president of the Safe 
Food Coalition in Washington and a former USDA Assistant Secretary in the 
Carter Administration, and Rod Leonard, executive director of the Community 
Nutrition Institute, a Washington-based advocacy group and a former FSIS 
Administrator in the Johnson Administration. Foreman and Leonard have been the 
most persistent critics of USDA. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Espy's claim that the meat and poultry inspection program has improved 
in the past 19 months, a consumer group recently urged the public to avoid 
hamburgers altogether because of the presence of E. coli 0157:H7 in ground 
meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Food Animal Concerns Trust, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said the risk 
of infection from E. coli 0157:H7 is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no apparent way in current meat production and inspection to contain 
the spread of this new illness. Consumers, however, can do something now to 
reduce the risks: stop eating hamburgers," Robert A. Brown, the group's 
president, said last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy, however, said there was no reason for consumers to avoid hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "All meat has germs. Always has and maybe always will," he said. "I think that 
as a government agency, USDA has a responsibility to reduce the levels of 
contamination and to mandate a stringent approach to protect public health. 
When it comes to hamburger, I think that it is certainly an overstatement (to 
say, 'Don't eat hamburgers.'). I think hamburger in this country is generally 
safe to eat. Just because red meat has germs doesn't necessarily mean that it 
will make you sick. Obviously, it is the kind of germs and the amount of germs 
in the meat itself. And that is exactly the approach we've taken and is exactly 
the approach that is necessary to reduce the amount of and likelihood of germs. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "However, at the end of the food chain is the consumer himself and there is no 
substitute for thoroughly cooking your meat. And that doesn't mean that 
relieves us of our responsibility of doing everything as a government to make 
sure that meat is safe. At the end of the food chain stands the consumer, and 
if that hamburger is cooked thoroughly there will not be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Espy said that USDA will not have a laboratory test until January, 1995, to 
determine the presence of E. coli 0157:H7 in meat while the carcasses are still 
in the processing plant and well before meat is shipped to retail channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is fair to say that I am frustrated by the (pace of test deployment) but 
I'm also proud that the progress has been steady," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy expressed displeasure as well with the resistance to his plans to 
reorganize USDA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to downsize this department, which has 110,000 people in 14,000 
offices throughout the country with a $71 billion budget. I'm saying that we 
have too many offices chasing too few farmers. I want to close 1,100 offices 
and reduce the Washington operations by 14 agencies," he said. "We want to 
eliminate 7,500 positions here in Washington and we have hit our target already 
for this year. And I want to save $2.5 billion in taxpayers' money. But some 
people don't like it because they think career employment is a way of life 
here."

 Some of the world's best red wines are better at 10 years of age than they are 
when released. But regardless of grape variety, all red wines lose their fruit 
aroma in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a brief guide to the aging of red wine: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cabernet: I age mine between 10 and 20 years, preferring them at 12 to 14. 
Bordeaux from great vintages age well for 10 to 30 years, but I like them 
typically no older than 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merlot: Only the very best California Merlots can make it 10 years without 
cracking up. I drink mine at 3 to 7 years of age.  
</P>
<P>
 * Zinfandel: With age, Zinfandels gain plummy, jammy notes. At about 10 years 
of age, they become more like older Cabernets. I like them at 6 to 9. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pinot Noir: This wine ages well for three to four years after the vintage, 
and in fact is best not consumed very young. But at 5 years from the vintage, 
the wine seems to reach an early peak.  
</P>
<P>
 * Sangiovese: In Italy, the very best can age for decades, and usually are 
still fairly hard and tart when less than 5 years old. I prefer them at 6 to 9. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nebbiolo: Among the longest-lived of wines, Barolo and Barbaresco become 
glorious in time. Age the best of them at least 10 years. DAN BERGER

TABLE TALK; OPINION BREAKER; THE AMES TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1972, when Bruce Ames developed a simple method to test for mutagens, it 
changed the way chemicals were tested for cancer-causing potential. He started 
with a strain of bacteria that couldn't grow because of a mutation in a 
particular gene; in order for them to grow, that gene would have to be mutated 
back.If you added a chemical to a Petri dish full of these bacteria and a few 
started to grow, that was prima facie evidence that the chemical was mutagenic. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was known that some chemicals that didn't themselves mutate genes 
might give rise to mutagens in the body, Ames refined this test by adding 
ground liver. The liver is the body's chief metabolizing organ; if the chemical 
is going to turn into something else in the body, liver cells are what will 
change it. This worked the same as the earlier test: Add the chemical and watch 
for bacterial growth.  
</P>
<P>
 This method became known as the Ames mutagenicity test. Federal regulations 
might still require slow, expensive animal tests before a substance can be 
declared non-carcinogenic, but the Ames test provides a quick way to weed out 
obvious carcinogens. CHARLES PERRY

TABLE TALK; OPINION BREAKER; BRUCE AMES: STANDING BY HIS SCIENTIFIC GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Would you like a coffee?" asks Bruce Ames sociably. It might seem an odd 
offer. Ames is famous for having pointed out that a cup of coffee contains 10 
milligrams of natural carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, Ames, who is 65, likes coffee. He and his Italian wife 
collect old espresso machines, and he brews a respectable cup. Besides, Ames 
never meant to scare people away from coffee. He was making a point about 
pesticides: Ten milligrams is how much artificial pesticide residue the average 
person ends up ingesting in a year. In other words, eating non-organic produce 
for a year is no more dangerous than drinking one cup of coffee. And what's the 
harm in that? 
</P>
<P>
 Ames' scientific credentials are imposing: chief of the microbial genetics 
section at the National Institutes of Health, chairman of the biochemistry 
department at University of California, Berkeley, member of the National 
Academy of Sciences. He has published 300 science papers, won numerous 
scientific awards and served on the board of directors of the National Cancer 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, he was a well-known critic of pesticides and synthetic food 
additives such as saccharin. "There is no question that society is going to pay 
for all the pesticides that have been used in the past," he told the New York 
Times ominously in 1977, "through increases in birth defects and cancer, but no 
one knows exactly what the price will be and when it will be paid." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But about 15 years ago he started casting doubt on the idea that pesticides 
pose a major health risk. Today he'd go further and suggest that panic about 
the dangers of technology leads to policies that are not just inappropriate but 
downright dangerous to our health. 
</P>
<P>
 He sits in his office in Berkeley, surrounded by ceiling-high cases full of 
books and periodicals, and tells how his ideas developed, beginning the tale in 
the mid-1960s, when he was still at the National Institutes of Health, years 
before he became either an opponent or an advocate of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always sort of half in genetics and half in biochemistry," he says. "We 
were mutating bacteria to see how (genetic) regulatory pathways worked. I was 
interested in how genes got turned on and turned off. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then at one point, as a sort of side project, I started wondering about 
all the new chemicals coming into the environment. I was reading too many 
labels on potato chip packages," he says, chuckling. "I thought if some of 
these chemicals were mutagens (agents that change genes), that wouldn't be 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, people didn't know what was causing cancer. There was an old 
theory that chemicals that caused cancer were mutagens -- they were working by 
mutating the DNA. But a lot of carcinogens turned out not to be mutagens, and 
people said no, carcinogens are working in some mysterious way, but not as 
mutagens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, being a geneticist, all my intuition said mutagens had to be 
carcinogens. Cancer is when you have a cell that is different in some way, and 
the way you get that is by mutating it. Then in the cancer field a few people 
started showing that, say, benzopyrene, which is a very un reactive compound, 
isn't the real carcinogen. It's metabolized in the body into other chemicals, 
and some of those are reactive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ames had developed a simple test (see box) that for many purposes replaced the 
older way of finding out whether a chemical might be carcinogenic. Before Ames, 
the only way to test for carcinogenicity was to try a chemical on animals, 
mostly rats or mice, for several years to see whether any of them developed 
cancer. Typically, the amount of the chemical given would be the Maximum 
Tolerated Dose (MTD), which is just less than the amount that would kill them 
outright by poisoning. Since virtually all chemicals are poisonous at very high 
doses, Ames and many other scientists believe that MTD tests do not show that a 
chemical is carcinogenic at low doses, only that cells may become cancerous 
under extreme stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames also stresses that MTD levels bear no relationship to the amount of a 
chemical a person encounters in the real world. However, MTD tests were 
mandated by the so-called Delaney Clause, an addition to the 1958 Federal Food, 
Drug and Cosmetic Act, which makes it illegal for processed foods to contain 
any detectable amount of a chemical that has ever been found to cause cancer, 
no matter how high a dose it took. Many authorities believe the Delaney Clause 
imposes an unrealistic standard of safety; last year Carol Browner, 
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, spoke of replacing it 
with a "negligible risk" standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "An animal cancer test costs a million dollars and takes two or three years," 
says Ames, "and (the Ames test) was something you could do in an afternoon. 
Companies are desperate to weed out bad chemicals -- it's bad for business to 
poison people -- and they're right on top of things, because it's their own 
money that's involved. So the minute our test came out and we showed that most 
of the classical carcinogens could be picked up as mutagens, every company in 
the world dealing with chemicals wrote for the strains, and thousands of labs 
all over the world use our test." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames says he never thought about patenting the test, so he's never made a 
penny from it. At any rate, the test made him famous and a hero of the 
anti-pesticide movement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in the late 1970s, his thinking changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got into the field because I was thinking about synthetic chemicals," he 
says. "But synthetic chemicals are just a drop in the bucket compared to the 
chemicals in the natural world. People started using our test and finding there 
were mutagens in celery and in a cup of coffee. The natural world is full of 
mutagens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the whole environmental movement came up -- 'If it's man-made, it's bad; 
if it's natural, it's fine.' Well, that didn't fit with anything I knew about 
toxicology, so I became increasingly suspicious of this kind of thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every plant has 50 or 100 chemicals that it uses to kill off insects or 
predators. Plants don't have claws or teeth or immune systems and they can't 
run away. How do they defend themselves? Chemical warfare. Practically all of 
plant evolution is chemical warfare. We've pointed out that 99.9% of the 
pesticides we encounter are natural." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a toxicologist, Ames saw no reason to expect these natural pesticides to be 
safer than synthetic pesticides, to which they're often chemically related. 
"People say, 'Oh, (these natural pesticides) have been around, we can deal with 
them.' But the way we deal with them is by general defenses that are good 
against synthetics too. Animals don't deal with chemicals one at a time, 
because they need to deal with tens of thousands of natural poisons." 
</P>
<P>
 Having concluded that synthetic pesticides were not the danger he had once 
suspected, Ames turned his inquiry to the causes of cancer. "I started talking 
with the best epidemiologists," he says. "Cancer is very complicated, so it's 
taken a long time to sort all this out. Now I think we understand most of the 
causes of cancer, and we know how to prevent a lot of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incidence of cancer goes up very sharply with age. Mice live two years; 
by the end of their life span about a third of them have cancer. Monkeys live 
20 or 30 years; by the end of their life span about a third of them have 
cancer. People live 80 or 90 years; by the end of our life span, about a third 
of us have cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp upturn toward the end of life, says Ames, suggests that cancer isn't 
just caused by getting exposed to mutagens; the cells themselves must be 
getting less resistant. "If you ask evolutionary biologists why there is 
aging," he says, "they'll say aging is trade-offs. They don't think that 
animals die out of altruism, to make room for others. That doesn't fit anything 
they know about evolutionary biology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's trade-offs, and the main trade-off is between reproduction and 
maintenance. Animals put a lot of their energy into reproduction -- they 
reproduce fast and get out their children -- and maintaining the body takes 
second place. Plus, in the old days, humans were dying early of disease and 
infections, they only lived to be 30 or 40. Now that we've conquered all those 
diseases, we're living long enough to get cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that our own metabolism exposes us to danger, because it's based 
on one of the most reactive chemicals, oxygen. When a cell burns fat or 
carbohydrates to get energy, the byproducts include not only water but unstable 
compounds related to water that have extra electrons in the molecule: hydrogen 
superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical. These "free radicals" quickly 
unload their spare electrons on other molecules in the cell; when the other 
molecule is DNA, it can mean trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 "A trillion molecules of oxygen go through each cell per day," says Ames. "A 
current estimate is that only 100,000 of them actually wound some part of the 
DNA strand, and the cell has DNA repair mechanisms that fix all but about 1,000 
oxidative hits a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "So that's pretty good, when you think about it. But that means every day 
you're accumulating 1,000 more lesions (wounds) in every cell, so by the time 
you're old, we find a few million oxygen lesions per cell. And when the cell 
divides, those turn into mutations, or some percentage of them does. Most 
mutations don't matter, but some are in key genes and then you have cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 These days Ames is particularly interested in the importance of diet. "I think 
that's where the gold is," he says. "Gladys Block, a professor at Berkeley, has 
analyzed 172 epidemiological studies from around the world, and what comes out 
overwhelmingly is that fruits and vegetables protect you against cancer. If you 
compare the group eating the most fruits and vegetables with the group eating 
the least -- most being four or five portions per day and least being zero or 
one -- the difference is two- to three-fold for practically every type of 
cancer. Fruits and vegetables are our source of antioxidants, such as Vitamin C 
and carotenoids and a good part of our Vitamin E. 
</P>
<P>
 "The studies suggest that antioxidants protect not only against cancer but 
against heart disease, against cataracts, against certain kinds of brain 
dysfunction. And it makes sense to me, because there's all this oxidant damage 
going on to your DNA, to your proteins, to your lipids, that we can measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ask top epidemiologists what the causes of cancer are, they'll say 
about a third is due to smoking, about a third is due to bad diet. About a 
third is due to chronic infections such as hepatitis-B virus, hepatitis-C virus 
-- they cause liver cancer, the main cancer in China and Africa. About 20% is 
due to hormones -- this is going to add up to more than 100% because cancer is 
multi-causal. And then a little bit is due to occupation, a few percent, and 
pollution, I think, less than 1%." 
</P>
<P>
 All this has made Ames more critical than ever of the anti-pesticide movement. 
"Pesticides lower cancer rates," he insists, "because they make fruits and 
vegetables cheaper and people buy more of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all a matter of where you want to put the money. EPA regulations are 
costing 2% of the GDP, according to EPA's own figures. We're talking about 
hundreds of billions of dollars. They're trying to save a hypothetical life for 
$50 million per life saved, but you could give that money to the Highway 
Department and save a life for, say, $300,000, improving a freeway. If you put 
the money into basic research, you're probably saving a life for $100,000. And 
I think (the life saved by EPA) is a hypothetical life anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is very complicated. And to simplify all these things and just sell 
scare stories, all it does is kill people, because it diverts resources from 
more important things. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the scare stories, people don't know what's important anymore. And 
it turns out what's important is what your mother told you: Don't smoke, eat a 
good diet, settle down and live a moderate life. Your mother was right."

WINE: SIMPLY REDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Waugh, the 90-year-old former director of Chateau Latour, was once asked 
how long it had been since he mistook a Bordeaux for a Burgundy. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Waugh, "Not since lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Waugh isn't alone. Even expert tasters, served wines unidentified and asked to 
name them, are often fooled. It's happened to me, and it's humbling. It's just 
not easy to identify a specific red wine solely by aroma and taste. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, with some wines that particular parlor trick is easy. A grape as 
spicy and fragrant as Muscat, the basis for Asti Spumante, should be readily 
identifiable to any wine lover. 
</P>
<P>
 But most red wines are aged in oak barrels for maturity and wood flavor. Often 
the result is a wine that has grape flavors mixed with flavors and scents from 
things such as oak, oxidation, maderization. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at how the most common red grape varieties should taste. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cabernet Sauvignon: This Bordeaux grape, which has produced America's 
greatest wines to date, offers an intriguing array of aromas and flavors. Fruit 
elements include black cherry and red currant; when the grapes grow on 
well-drained (i.e., mountain) soils, the aroma is like black currants and 
cassis.  
</P>
<P>
 Most top-rank Cabernets, both from California and Bordeaux, also have elements 
that are herbal, rather than fruit-like, such as tarragon, thyme and sage. A 
decade ago, Cabernet grown in cool regions (such as Monterey County) often had 
strong vegetal smells like weeds, bell pepper, asparagus, even cooked spinach. 
Recent advances in the vineyards have all but eliminated the problem. The aroma 
of green or black olives is a common component in many cooler-climate 
Cabernets, notably from France. Some people also find a mild cigar box smell. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merlot: Similar to Cabernet, Merlot usually is made lighter, with more 
elegance, so it may have more cherry-ish fruit. But the variety also has more 
green-herb notes than Cabernet, so it can smell more of green olives, tarragon 
or even green tea. 
</P>
<P>
 * Zinfandel: This grape, known primarily in California, makes a wine with more 
fruit-type flavor than just about any other "serious" red wine, but the fruit 
elements vary, depending on where the grapes are grown. 
</P>
<P>
 In cooler regions, this late- and erratic-ripening grape can smell like 
raspberries and green peppercorns; mountain vines often have a black pepper 
note. In moderate climates, strawberry and blueberry notes dominate, with 
traces of anise and clove. Warmer climates make Zinfandels that smell of ripe 
blackberries, jam, plums and currants; in hot regions, Zinfandel can have an 
aroma akin to violets. 
</P>
<P>
 The word "spice" is often used to refer to the wild, racy aroma in most young 
Zinfandels. This may include traces of cinnamon and allspice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pinot Noir: Many longtime wine lovers say Burgundy is the greatest red wine 
of all, and all great Burgundy is made entirely of Pinot Noir. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is maddeningly difficult to describe great Pinot Noir. J. Michael 
Broadbent (of Christie's auction house in London), a prolific wine taster, says 
the underlying aroma of great Pinot Noir is like "boiled beet root," hardly a 
charming notion. 
</P>
<P>
 I look for wild strawberry, cherry and clove with hints of fresh tomatoes, 
mint or basil, smoke and anise. But that just scratches the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Grown in some regions (such as California's Central Coast), Pinot Noir has a 
delicate herbal note not unlike spinach or leaf tobacco. And its taste can be 
mildly peppery, which changes the cherry nuances and makes the anise stand out. 
In the Carneros region, the herbal notes are muted by more red currant and 
cherry. 
</P>
<P>
 A key point: Pinot Noir lacks some of the color components in its skin that 
other grapes have, so most Pinot Noirs and many Burgundies will be lighter in 
color when they are young than comparable Cabernets/Bordeaux. This doesn't make 
them lighter in taste, however, especially when the great ones are aged 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beaujolais: The red wine of Beaujolais, by far the best known reasonably 
priced fine wine on the planet, is made from the Gamay grape and is fairly 
"grape-y" in smell, with intense cherry and an almost strawberry Jell-O kind of 
note. 
</P>
<P>
 This quaffing wine (along with California Gamay Beaujolais -- made from a 
grape variety that is unrelated to the true Gamay but yields similar wine) is 
generally lighter in texture than one based on Pinot Noir or Cabernet, and is 
best served slightly chilled. It is a fine all-purpose wine that matches well 
with a wide variety of foods.  
</P>
<P>
 * Sangiovese: This is the main grape of Chianti; a few California wineries 
also make wine from it. The grape has a variety of aromas including violets, 
tree bark and fresh, tart tomatoes. It usually makes a tart, dry wine, not as 
generous as some Americans prefer, but its affinity for foods is legend. 
</P>
<P>
 * Syrah: This grape, dominant in France's Rhone Valley, makes a deep wine with 
notes of blackberry, tar, anise and sandalwood. Not as peppery or weighty as 
the unrelated Petite Sirah, Syrah has become the prime blending grape for 
Rhone-style wines in California. Blended with Grenache and its faint cherry and 
orange blossom aroma, it can make great, elegant and long-lived wines. 
Australian wines called Shiraz are bigger, deeper and more chocolate-y than the 
California versions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nebbiolo: This grape is almost exclusive to the Piedmont region of Northern 
Italy, where it makes the great, long-lived wines of Barolo and Barbaresco. Its 
aroma is like dried roses, tar, anise and earth. In younger wines made from 
Nebbiolo, I have often found a violet note, which seems to degrade into jam as 
the wine ages.

IN THE KITCHEN; HARD-BOILED DETECTIVE MEETS SHY MOLECULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people lust after foie gras ; others yearn for perfectly cooked 
hard-boiled eggs. The latter are probably more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 To tell the truth, the matter had never really crossed my mind until a friend 
began rhapsodizing about these hard-boiled eggs she had eaten two or three 
years ago. "They were perfectly cooked," she said, "firm, but still moist . . . 
you know, not rubbery. And the yolks were this deep-gold color, without that 
any of that awful green outside. How come you never see hard-boiled eggs like 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The one or two times every year I want a hard-boiled egg (Easter not included, 
since those eggs rarely even get cracked, much less eaten), I cook the eggs the 
way my mom taught me: Put an egg in water, bring to a boil, cook until done. 
</P>
<P>
 The flaw in this technique is obvious: How do you know when the egg is done? 
Well, when it seems as if it should be. It's like boiling rice with the lid on; 
if you can't see what you're cooking, you're left only with instinct. And when 
you cook something only once or twice a year, your instincts are bound to be a 
bit, shall we say, rusty. 
</P>
<P>
 But it sounded like an interesting problem. Since eggs cook at a fairly 
constant rate, and since boiling water stays at a fairly constant temperature, 
cooking time should be the only variable. Just as there is a legendary 3-minute 
soft-boiled egg, it seems there must be a 10- or 15-minute hard-boiled egg. 
</P>
<P>
 So I got 15 eggs, numbered them with a magic marker, covered them with cold 
water and brought them to a boil in The Times Test Kitchen. After the water 
reached a boil, I pulled the eggs out at one-minute intervals, in numerical 
order, and chilled them in an ice-water bath. When all the eggs had been 
cooked, I cracked each egg open and compared the results. 
</P>
<P>
 I got something that seemed like an answer -- a cooking time of somewhere 
between 13 and 14 minutes yielded a hard-boiled egg that could be considered 
"perfectly cooked," depending on whose taste you're cooking them to. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But when I tried to repeat the process using just four eggs, the times were 
off by as much as two minutes. The problem? Water reaches a boil depending on 
how much solid matter it has to heat. What's more, the culinary definition of a 
boil is fairly elastic, ranging from the 185-degree simmer to the 212-degree 
roll. My first batch was maintained at a pretty steady simmer. I had to answer 
the phone while the second batch was cooking and returned to find the water 
raging away at full tilt. 
</P>
<P>
 To eliminate those problems, I decided to start the eggs in boiling water, 
hoping the temperature would stay more constant. But this time, no matter how 
golden the yolks were, there was no way these eggs could be considered well 
cooked, much less perfectly cooked. In the first place, there was definite 
"banding" of the yolks -- the inside might be golden, but the outside would be 
pale and on the verge of being overcooked. What's worse, half the eggs had 
popped their shells, spewing little plumes of egg white. What's more, the 
whites were rubbery. 
</P>
<P>
 So I retreated to the library to try and figure out exactly what it is that 
happens when an egg is cooked. It turns out -- the egg business being a sizable 
industry -- there is quite a body of scientific literature on the subject, 
ranging from "Quantitative Analysis of Gelation in Egg Protein Systems" to 
"Influence of Three Organic Acids on the Quality Characteristics of Hard-cooked 
Eggs." 
</P>
<P>
 I took the easy way out, choosing a 1983 American Scientist article called 
"The Culinary Alchemy of Eggs," by Arthur E. Grosser, a professor of chemistry 
at McGill University who specializes in molecular beam kinetics. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that there's a lot more to cooking an egg than meets the eye. "An 
egg protein is a shy molecule," Grosser writes, "and when left all alone it 
will curl up into itself, coiling into a ball." But when heat is applied, the 
proteins react. "As the temperature increases, the action becomes more 
energetic until a molecular demolition derby is under way. The weak internal 
bonds of the egg protein can no longer hold the ball together and it opens out 
into a floppy streamer." 
</P>
<P>
 When this happens, "it exposes a soft underbelly of richly seductive targets 
for chemical attack and bonding. As these protein streamers bump into each 
other, they immediately bond and form strong links . . . until there is a 
three-dimensional protein network, semirigid and resilient." 
</P>
<P>
 Grosser's article also explains why my eggs had cracked -- it was a simple 
thermodynamic reaction. Every egg has an air pocket inside. When that air 
pocket is quickly heated it expands, cracking the shell and spewing the white. 
In my first tries, starting the eggs in cold water, the air pocket was heated 
more gradually, allowing the extra air to bubble off slowly through the porous 
shell. You can accomplish much the same thing by pricking a small hole in the 
broad end of the shell to let the air escape. 
</P>
<P>
 And that pesky green ring? Grosser says it's a chemical reaction. As the 
protein in the egg white warms during cooking, it gives off a small amount of 
hydrogen sulfide gas. When that gas meets the iron particles present in every 
yolk, it forms iron sulfide -- the greenish band. Fortunately, this is one of 
the last of the chemical reactions involved in cooking an egg. Don't overcook 
and you won't get a green band. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I was no closer to my perfectly cooked egg. Just as I was ready to 
throw up my hands and give up, a colleague came into the kitchen. "You know the 
best way to cook hard-boiled eggs?" she asked. "The way my mom taught me: Start 
them in cold water, bring them just to a boil and then turn the heat off right 
away and let the eggs sit. When the water is cool enough to put your hand in, 
take the eggs out. Works every time." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, I was willing to try anything. So I stuck an egg in a pot and 
gave it a shot. When the water had cooled just enough that I could reach my 
hand in, I pulled the egg and cracked it open. The yolk was a lovely even 
golden yellow, the white was tender. Excited, I tried again, this time with a 
half-dozen eggs and letting the water cool even more. The same result. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The more I thought about it, the more sense it made. The key factor in this 
cooking method is a very gentle heat curve. After all, it doesn't take much 
heat to cook an egg -- the proteins become firm-tender at 160 degrees -- and as 
long as the eggs don't get much beyond that temperature, they won't overcook. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically, then, you could leave an egg in 159-degree water forever and it 
wouldn't get tough. The eggs heat up at a slow rate and -- just when those 
proteins get going really crazy -- begin to cool again, slowly. Using this 
method, by the time the egg yolks get to that perfect temperature, the water 
surrounding them is already cooling to below it. 
</P>
<P>
 What could be easier?

GOOD COOKING: HAVE YOU EVER BARBECUED A TORTILLA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 During August, barbecued hamburgers and chicken may begin to lose their 
appeal, but we still want to grill things. Consider, then, a light supper menu 
that uses the barbecue in an entirely different way -- grilling quesadillas 
filled with onions, tomatoes, Chihuahua cheese and a bold cilantro mustard. 
Serve them with a crunchy sweet-corn confetti salad, spooned into small lettuce 
leaves for easy serving, even easier eating. 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, bring on a plate of Mexican praline cookies, a buttery 
caramel-pine nut cookie that holds up in the summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chihuahua cheese resembles a fairly soft Cheddar with a good proportion of 
fat, which means it melts quickly and tastes great. You can substitute a good 
medium-sharp Cheddar, Muenster or Monterey Jack. The Cilantro Mustard is 
piquant enough to bring these straightforward ingredients together.  
</P>
<P>
 GRILLED QUESADILLAS WITH CILANTRO MUSTARD 1 large red onion (about 3/4 pound), 
sliced 1/4-inch thick 8 (6 1/2-inch diameter) flour tortillas 1 large tomato 
(about 3/4 pound), sliced thin 2 cups Chihuahua cheese, shredded Cilantro 
Mustard Cilantro Salt Water for brushing 
</P>
<P>
 Grill onion slices over hot barbecue fire, turning once, until starting to 
brown and soften. Set aside. May be done several hours ahead and kept at room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread 1 tablespoon Cilantro Mustard on 1 tortilla, then layer with 1/4 cup 
cheese, 1/4 of grilled onion, 1/4 of tomato slices and cilantro to taste. 
Sprinkle lightly with salt and another 1/4 cup cheese. Spread 1 tablespoon 
Cilantro Mustard on 2nd tortilla and place on top, mustard side down. Compact 
gently with hands. Fill remaining tortillas in same way. Brush tortillas 
lightly with water. 
</P>
<P>
 Grill quesadillas over hot barbecue fire, turning once until cheese is melted. 
(To turn easily, transfer each onto paper plate, place 2nd plate over and 
invert; use spatula to transfer back onto grill.) While quesadillas are 
cooking, press down with spatula to keep from coming apart. Makes 4 servings.

 If this is your first taste of raw corn, you're in for a treat. This salad can 
be served right after it's mixed or held a day in the refrigerator. It's in 
lettuce leaves, so it could be a finger food. CRUNCHY SWEET-CORN CONFETTI SALAD 
2 cups corn cut off the cob (from about 2 large ears) 1/2 cup diced zucchini 
1/2 cup diced red pepper 3 large green onions, sliced 1 cup diced jicama Small

 " Food is never just something to eat. " -- Margaret Visser 'Much Depends on 
Dinner' 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You spend all day cooking over a hot stove -- filleting a beautiful live fish 
and then carefully frying it so that it's crisp-skinned yet moist; picking out 
the best hen in the back yard, boning it with the quickest flick of your knife, 
stuffing it with wonderful things, then simmering it in rich broth; plunging 
crackling, fat pork, boiled and marinated, from a wok of hot oil into an ice 
bath, then braising it with the most flavorful gravy you can imagine and making 
it into kind of a vegetable-stuffed terrine . . . and your kids greet your 
splendid Sunday meal with sullen stares and slumped shoulders. You are the most 
famous chef in Taipei, raising three daughters on your own, but you might as 
well be a bachelor dad in Tarzana nuking fish-sticks in the microwave, because 
at heart, families are same all over the world.  
</P>
<P>
 For many Americans, "60 Minutes" and "Murder She Wrote" have replaced the 
ritual of the traditional Sunday family dinner. It's not that the family meal 
has entirely disappeared, but it doesn't take a sociologist to tell you that as 
families fragment, the time we spend eating together shrinks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Chinese in Taiwan, at least in recent years, things may not be much 
different. And for director Ang Lee, who dreamed up this multi-daughtered 
Taiwanese chef for his newest film "Eat Drink Man Woman," the subject of 
fragmenting families is an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 "In each of my films," Lee says, "I've tried to do an observation of the 
changing Chinese society and people's struggles within it. It's a society that 
was structured toward the family unit for thousands of years, but suddenly that 
is changing. The family is collapsing, social values are collapsing, 
politically things are collapsing, moving toward Western values -- toward 
democracy, industry, toward personal free will and respect for each other's 
freedom. People haven't really adjusted. In one sense, you want to break away 
from the burdens of the old culture. On the other hand, you kind of miss the 
old values. There's a lot of feeling aroused. You don't know what to believe 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 His last film, "The Wedding Banquet" dealt with the hypocrisy of family 
rituals and marriage. In "Eat Drink Man Woman," the story of a father and three 
daughters searching for love centers around the kitchen and the dinner table. 
"Kitchens are an emotional place," Lee says. "The dining table is a metaphor -- 
a ritual that brings people together and separates them as well. It symbolizes 
their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things that can't be taken for granted in Lee's world: that a woman 
can cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Both "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman" feature women who can 
barely fry an egg -- and men who create wonderful family feasts. This mirrors 
not only modern Chinese society, but Lee's own life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a good cook, my brother is a good cook, a lot of my male friends are good 
cooks," Lee says. "But my wife doesn't cook at all. A lot of Chinese women I 
know aren't required to cook any more so they run away -- as far as they can -- 
from the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Eat Drink Man Woman," one of the central strands of the plot involves Chef 
Chu's dominion over the kitchens both at home and the fancy hotel where he 
works, and the bottled resentment of beautiful middle daughter Jai-Chen who was 
banished from both kitchens as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just couldn't conceive of a woman being a real chef!" Jai-Chen tells her 
father at one point in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, you could have become one of the greats," her father's devoted sous-chef 
Old Wen admits when Chu doesn't answer. "But your father was right to encourage 
you in your studies. And you, such a success! You owe it all to your father for 
throwing you out of our smelly old kitchen and keeping you on the right path!" 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the real heroine of the movie," Lee says. "She's the smartest, the 
prettiest and she sees through the stiffness and phoniness of the family 
structure. She's a modern woman figure, which I personally admire. She's like 
my wife and a lot of women I know today who have to carry double duties -- they 
have careers, but traditional roles as well." 
</P>
<P>
 But even Lee himself is surprised when a reporter asks if one of the plot 
lines he considered was to have Jai-Chen fulfill her dream of joining her 
father in the hotel kitchen at the end of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be almost impossible," Lee says. "You see, usually chefs in China 
are not so educated. Usually, they come from poor families and are trained in 
disciple-master system. It's a heavy-duty job." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Jai-Chen takes her father's place in the family kitchen: She 
continues the ritual Sunday dinners after her father takes up with a much 
younger woman. And finally, she gets what she really wants from her father -- 
respect for her cooking.  
</P>
<P>
 "The father-daughter relationship in Chinese society is a very odd man-woman 
relationship," Lee says. "The point here is that he is taking her as the son in 
the family. I think it's a universal dream for a child to hold a parent's hand 
and really communicate, to say 'father-daughter.' It's that simple, but it's 
almost unreachable." 
</P>
<P>
 In almost any other film, the food in that last scene would be nothing more 
than a prop. But Lee is one of the few directors who knows how to use food both 
as metaphor and a symptom of character: in an Ang Lee movie, a man's reaction 
to a piece of fish tells as deeply as a sigh in a Bresson film.  
</P>
<P>
 You know things aren't going to go well for one character, for instance, when 
she absent-mindedly eats an orange, white pith first, and smashes cigarette 
after cigarette into a plate of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a full week of 16- and 20-hour days to shoot the first scene in "Eat 
Drink Man Woman" in which Chef Chu cooks Sunday dinner. On the set were three 
master chefs and a food consultant, Pei Mei, the Julia Child of Chinese 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the food arrived," Lee says, "we had to figure out the best way to 
present it and decide which processes of preparation were the most fascinating 
to watch. Then, it took a long time to light. It couldn't be lit like a food 
commercial -- that would be too unrealistic. At the same time, I wanted to 
bring out the best in the food." 
</P>
<P>
 All this took up valuable crew time. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Taiwan, it's a very director-oriented system," Lee says. "With another 
producer, in another country, they never would have let me spend so much time 
on food." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's obsession with food started early. "My father is very into the culture 
of eating," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until he came to the United States, as a theater student at the 
University of Illinois, that Lee first started cooking for himself. "I couldn't 
get used to the food here," he says. After he married and graduated from New 
York University's film school, he got serious about cooking -- he had a family 
to feed. "I spent six years cooking at home when I was doing Hollywood 
development hell," Lee says. "I know the details of the cooking world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make a pretty mean Chinese meatball with cabbage, Lion's Head," he says. 
"And I cooked for the first time on television the other days -- shrimp with 
garlic sauce on the Food Channel." 
</P>
<P>
 If he doesn't watch out, he may end up as famous for his cooking as his 
movies.

GARDEN FRESH; THEY CALL IT MELON YELLOW

 Does yellow watermelon taste richer than red? To me it does. Golden foods seem 
to have golden flavor. Butterscotch. Peaches, nectarines, papayas, pineapple. 
Buttery crookneck -- and acorn, banana and spaghetti squashes. Corn and wax 
beans. Some tomatoes, melons and plums. The sunny side of an egg. Olive oil 
from Provence. 
</P>
<P>
 Does home-grown watermelon taste better than store-bought? You bet! Cutting 
into a golden watermelon you've raised is downright thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Watermelons have been giving pleasure for thousands of years. For their part, 
the melons enjoy the hot days and nights of summer with the softness of 
humidity in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeds are sown indoors in spring. Order early. From seed to table, big 
watermelons take about 3 1/2 months. If you're in a warm-to-hot-summer part of 
Southern California, sow directly into the soil from April through June. Along 
the coast, sow May and June. In the high desert, mid-March through June; in the 
low desert, February and March. In the mountains, where I live, we start 
watermelon seeds indoors in May.  
</P>
<P>
 Willhite Seed Co. in Poolville, Tex., offers a mouthwatering assortment of 
goldens. Willhite says farmers grow Orangeglo for themselves (in catalogue 
descriptions, "a fine home garden variety" means the rind is too thin to ship 
without breaking, so grow it for your own pleasure). Orangeglo's flesh is the 
color of ripe peaches, and the oval fruits can weigh 50 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Tastigold is a round golden watermelon half Orangeglo's weight. Picked at the 
peak of ripeness, Tastigold's flavor rivals the best watermelon of any color. 
For an open-pollinated melon -- you can save its seeds and grow them -- choose 
sugary crisp Golden Honey. 
</P>
<P>
 In inland areas where citrus thrives, you can grow any golden watermelon 
cultivar you like, but in warm areas where water is in short supply, plant 
sweet Desert King. I have, and it's not only delicious but enormously 
drought-tolerant. In cooler arid climates such as the high desert, try Hopi 
Yellow Meated, which is grown in the sandy Southwest on nothing but rain water. 
I've grown that one too, and it's exciting. Both are open-pollinated. 
</P>
<P>
 Where summers are cooler or the seasons shorter, choose small icebox-size 
melons that ripen in 70 to 75 days. You can rely on Yellow Baby to yield sweet 
seven-inch golden watermelons with few seeds. Sunshine F1 is slightly larger, 
with crisp, juicy flesh and thick rind for pickling. Delicious Early Moonbeam 
is open-pollinated. Yellow Doll, a small, very sweet hybrid with thin rind, 
ripens earliest, about 68 days. 
</P>
<P>
 To germinate seeds, wrap them in moist paper towels and seal in a plastic bag. 
Keep the bag at 75 to 85 degrees. Check every day to make sure the towel is 
moist. It takes five to 10 days for the seeds to sprout. 
</P>
<P>
 Watermelons need warm soil, so the day you sow your seeds, get a jump on the 
season: For each plant, lay a four- to five-foot square of black plastic mulch 
on a patch in full sun -- a southern exposure is best. The soil must be light, 
loose, well-draining, super-rich in organic matter and slightly acid (a pH of 6 
to 6.5). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When your seeds have sprouted, set two of them 1/4-inch deep in a three-inch 
container of good potting mix in a paper or peat pot. Grow in bright light at 
75 degrees and never let the soil dry out. When they are a couple of inches 
tall, pinch off the weaker of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 When the weather has settled and the soil is warm, slit an opening in the 
plastic mulch (where there's frost, wait until the last frost is a couple of 
weeks behind you). Carefully pull away the pot from the seedling and set the 
plant in the ground (mustn't disturb the roots). Space bush cultivars -- the 
ones that mature fastest -- about 3 feet apart. Water thoroughly with a Vitamin 
B1 solution.  
</P>
<P>
 If the nights are sometimes chilly, cover the seedlings with a floating row 
cover (a sheltering veil that lets sun and water through), but remove it when 
the nights turn warm or when the first flowers appear. If it's a cool spring, 
leave the plastic mulch in place until the days get hot, then remove it. 
Replace with a mulch of straw or leaves kept a few inches away from the vine. 
</P>
<P>
 Water every four days until fruits are developing; after that, once a week 
give an inch of water. Always water before 3 p.m., using a drip system if 
possible. Once a month, in the morning, spray leaves with a solution of half 
liquid fish, half kelp. Pick off any bugs. Around the middle of September, 
pinch off all blossoms -- this permits the plant to throw its energy into 
ripening existing fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to plant watermelons in a traditional watermelon patch. A bush 
watermelon looks charming in a garden border. The leaves resemble large, 
elongated maple leaves -- sometimes they're speckled white or gold. If there's 
room in your border for a vine to trail along the ground, remember -- the 
best-flavored melons come from long vines.  
</P>
<P>
 A better idea is to train long vines up a fence or trellis. In good soil, 
these can be set a foot apart. Growing watermelons upward is a great idea. Just 
support the fruits with a sling of soft cotton. If you haven't got room for a 
watermelon in the garden, raise a bush cultivar in a large growing bag on the 
deck or patio. Inquire about the bags at a nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a golden sound of summer? The hollow punk ! that comes when you thump a 
ripe watermelon. While not a trustworthy test at the market (overripe 
watermelons can punk too), thump your growing watermelons every few days. Do 
this in the morning when the melons are coolest. Other tests: The curly tendril 
on the stalk closest to the melon has dried, and the spot on the melon where it 
touches the ground is sunny yellow. Fruits generally keep in the peak of 
ripeness 10 to 14 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvest your melon with a knife, taking an inch of stem. Store it in a cool 
place. Thick rind of unripe melons can also be pickled. 
</P>
<P>
 Watermelon is one of Mother Nature's perfections. Unlike bananas and 
raspberries (which need cream), apples and pears (which need cheese), or 
peaches and strawberries (which need powdered sugar), there's nothing that 
watermelon needs to make it better -- and to me, golden watermelon is the pick 
of the crop. SOURCES

 Wanting something handsome and unusual to serve friends for lunch, I put 
together an Asian sort of golden watermelon salad. Colors and shapes are 
delightful, and all the elements work beautifully together -- the warm-flavored 
sesame oil and sweet rice vinegar are the catalysts. A mouthful of watermelon 
and snow peas is a pleasing surprise. All except the noodles (which may soon go 
limp) can be prepared a few hours in advance . If a composed salad isn't your 
cup of tea, cut the watermelon into large-bite-size chunks and toss all the 
ingredients together -- it'll be a different kind of gorgeous. And of course 
the recipe works with red-fleshed melon as well. Offer a fruity white wine such 
as Sauvignon Blanc. For dessert, serve slices of sponge cake garnished with 
sprigs of mint.  
</P>
<P>
 SALAD OF GOLDEN WATERMELON, SNOW PEAS AND SHRIMP 1 pound snow peas 3 pounds 
golden watermelon Mild vegetable oil 2 ounces cellophane noodles (mung bean 
flour noodles) 2 large bunches watercress, leaves and tender stems, chilled 32 
large shrimp, tails intact (about 3/4 pound), cooked 4 rings sliced from small 
sweet red pepper, chilled 2 tablespoons Asian sesame oil 1/4 cup rice vinegar 
Salt, freshly ground white pepper to taste 
</P>
<P>
 Remove strings from fresh snow peas. Drop into large pot boiling salted water. 
After 30 seconds when tender-crisp -- scoop out and drop into ice water. When 
cold, drain. Pat dry, wrap and chill. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut watermelon into wedges. Remove rind. Slice watermelon 1/2-inch thick, then 
cut into 32 long triangles. Wrap and chill. 
</P>
<P>
 In large heavy skillet over medium-high heat, bring 1/4-inch oil to 340 
degrees (an inch-wide bread cube browns in 70 seconds). Fry noodles by small 
handfuls. Once expanded, turn with tongs. Lift out before color deepens and 
drain on absorbent paper. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, cover chilled plates with watercress. On each, arrange 8 pieces 
watermelon as spokes of wheel. Set 1 shrimp at wide edge of each watermelon 
wedge, tails pointing in same direction. Overlap pea pods in center in mound. 
Crown pods with pepper ring, then strew noodles over all. Blend sesame oil, 
vinegar, salt and pepper and dribble over salad. Taste for seasoning. Makes 4 
servings.

CULINARY SOS: CREAM CHEESE CAKE, CHICKEN, JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DEAR SOS: This recipe for cream cheese loaf cake was printed in your paper 
about 25 years ago. The 1971 earthquake misplaced it, and the 1994 earthquake 
found it behind a wall cabinet, somewhat chewed up around the edges. Now it's 
difficult to read. Please print it again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- C. K. 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR C.K.: The ravages of time itself caused our recipe to vanish all 
together. We hope it is floating peacefully in recipe heaven, but we can't be 
sure. So let us help you reconstruct this unusual recipe for the benefit of 
other readers, old and new. CREAM CHEESE LOAF CAKE 2 1/4 cups sifted flour 1 
teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup shortening 1 2/3 cups sugar 2 
eggs 1 cup milk 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese 1/2 cup chopped walnuts 1 
tablespoon grated orange peel 1/4 cup orange juice 
</P>
<P>
 Sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Cream shortening and gradually 
add 1 1/2 cups sugar, continuing to cream until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, 
beating well. Add sifted dry ingredients alternately with milk, beginning and 
ending with dry ingredients. Blend well after each addition. Cut cheese into 
1/4-inch cubes and fold into batter, along with walnuts and orange peel. Turn 
batter into 2 greased and floured 9x5-inch loaf pans or 12 well-greased muffins 
tins. Bake at 375 degrees 50 to 55 minutes for loaves or 20 to 25 minutes for 
muffins, or until golden brown. Combine remaining 1/3 cup sugar and orange 
juice. Brush over hot loaves. Cool 30 minutes. Remove from pans. Cool 
completely before slicing. Makes 2 loaves, about 8 servings each.

 DEAR SOS: I enjoy Indian curries. Could you please print a recipe? 
</P>
<P>
 -- GINO 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR GINO: One of our favorite Indian-style curries is the one shared by Nancy 
Mehta, wife of conductor Zubin Mehta, when the couple lived in Los Angeles. 
NANCY MEHTA'S MOGHLAI CHICKEN 8 boned chicken breasts Seasoned flour 1/4 cup 
butter 2 to 3 large onions, chopped 6 large cloves garlic, crushed 1 (1/2-inch) 
piece ginger root, grated 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cumin 1 1/4 teaspoons cumin 
seeds, crushed 1 1/4 teaspoons caraway seeds 1 1/4 teaspoons turmeric 1 
teaspoon dried red chile 1 or 2 green chiles, split 1 or 2 large tomatoes, 
chopped 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cloves 1 1/4 teaspoons cardamom 1/4 cup brown 
sugar, packed 1 teaspoon saffron 2 tablespoons warm milk 1 cup sour cream 
</P>
<P>
 Dredge chicken breasts in seasoned flour and brown in butter. Remove chicken. 
Add onions, garlic and ginger and saute until onions are transparent. Add 
ground cumin and crushed cumin seeds, caraway seeds, turmeric, red chile and 
green chiles. Cook, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes until chiles are browned, spices 
are mixed and seeds are lightly fried. Add chicken breasts and tomatoes. Add 
water to cover and simmer about 25 minutes, or until chicken is tender. Remove 
chicken breasts to baking dish. Combine cloves, cardamom, brown sugar and 
saffron that has been soaked in warm milk with sour cream and pour over 
chicken. Heat at 250 degrees to keep warm until serving. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

 DEAR SOS: Do you have a recipe for banana jam? 
</P>
<P>
 -- OLLIE 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR OLLIE: Happily we do. You can, if you wish, reduce the recipe by half. 
BANANA JAM 12 cups sliced bananas (about 20 medium) 6 cups sugar 1 1/2 cups 
orange juice 3 strips orange peel 6 strips lemon peel 2 sticks cinnamon 6 whole 
cloves 
</P>
<P>
 In large kettle, combine sliced bananas with sugar, orange juice, orange and 
lemon peels, cinnamon and cloves. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. 
Boil rapidly 10 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring constantly, until 
thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes. When jam is thick, remove from heat and 
ladle immediately into sterilized canning jars. Fill to within 1/8 inch of top. 
Screw caps on evenly and tightly. Invert for few seconds, then stand jars 
upright to cool. If jam is to be stored for long period, place jars on rack in 
large kettle and cover with boiling water. Boil 10 to 15 minutes to sterilize. 
Remove from water and cool. Makes about 5 pints.

HOME COOK: ROLL A ROLY-POLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blackberry roly-poly is a dessert I like even better than fresh strawberry 
shortcake. 
</P>
<P>
 Roly-poly is an easy-to-make shortcake dough rolled around a filling of 
sugared berries, then baked until crisp and golden. Served warm with heavy 
cream, it will delight even the pickiest eater. 
</P>
<P>
 The original English roly-poly was made with a crust that contained suet. 
Instead of being baked, the roll was tied in a cloth bag and boiled or hung 
over a pot of simmering water to steam. Fresh-fruit roly-polies, such as the 
blackberry roly-poly, weren't common a hundred or so years ago. English cooks 
filled their roly-polies with jam, dried fruits or molasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackberry roly-poly makes a nice homey dessert after a supper of summer 
tomato soup, lettuce salad, and crackers and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You may substitute any other juicy fruit or berry for the blackberries.  
</P>
<P>
 BLACKBERRY ROLY-POLY 6 cups blackberries 1 cup sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 
Shortcake Dough 2 tablespoons butter, melted 1 cup heavy cream 
</P>
<P>
 Put berries in bowl and sprinkle sugar and salt over. Toss gently so sugar and 
salt are well distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Roll Shortcake Dough into rectangle about 1/2-inch thick (should be 
approximately 14 inches long and 7 inches wide). Spread melted butter over 
Shortcake Dough, then cover with some of berries and roll up loosely. Place 
roll in center of baking dish and spoon remaining berries all around. Bake 
until wooden skewer inserted in center of roll comes out clean (not sticky with 
raw dough), about 40 minutes. Remove, serve warm with heavy cream. Makes 6 
servings.

4 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar 5 tablespoons 
butter 2/3 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 Mix flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in bowl. Cut butter into bits and 
work into flour mixture with fingertips or pastry cutter until it resembles 
coarse meal. Slowly stir in milk, using just enough to hold dough together (it 
usually takes 2/3 cup of milk). Turn out onto floured board and knead 1 minute. 
SUMMER TOMATO SOUP 2 1/2 pounds tomatoes 2 stalks celery, chopped 1 carrot, 
sliced 1 onion, chopped 1 small sweet green pepper, chopped 3 cloves garlic, 
peeled 2 tablespoons lemon juice Salt Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Cut tomatoes into small pieces and put into 3-quart pot. Stir in 2 cups of 
water. Add chopped celery, carrot, onion, green pepper and garlic cloves. Bring 
vegetable mixture to boil, reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Strain soup. If serving soup hot, put liquid back into pot and keep warm. If 
serving soup cold, put liquid in bowl and set aside. Put vegetables through 
food mill or puree in blender or food processor. Stir pureed vegetables into 
liquid, add lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot or cold. Makes 
8 servings.

THE THICKENING TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You want ripe fruit for a good dessert, but ripe fruit is juicy and must be 
thickened.Experienced cooks usually have a favorite thickener. I've tested the 
following two; either does a fine job if used judiciously. 
</P>
<P>
 * Flour or Tapioca: Add 2 tablespoons to every 5 or 6 cups of fruit or 
berries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cornstarch: Use 1 1/2 tablespoons to every 5 cups of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure is the same for each: Mix the thickener thoroughly with the 
sugar, add the fruit or berries and gently toss all together until the sugar 
mixture is well distributed. MARION CUNNINGHAM

A CHICKEN IN EVERY TAJINE

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Marrakesh in central Morocco is an oasis in more ways than one. 
Above the city tower the Atlas Mountains, rising so high that even in this 
sub-tropical climate they are tipped with snow for nine months of the year. I 
drive past produce stalls lining the roadside filled with melons, glistening 
fresh and dried dates, garlic, onions and wild mint, which adds heady fragrance 
to the infused mint tea served in North Africa at any hour and on any occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The boundaries of the ancient city, the medina , are marked by massive, 
rose-red walls. Driving at the pace of a donkey, I negotiate a gateway, then a 
narrowing lane crammed with people. It's supper time and tempting spices 
pervade the air. A caftan-clad figure emerges from the dusk: " Marhaban , 
bienvenue , welcome to Marrakesh," exclaims our host, Mustapha Belkouri, as my 
husband and I emerge from our car. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustapha leads us to a heavy, wooden door. Behind it, there is a second oasis, 
a tiled courtyard with a fountain surrounded by cool, peaceful rooms. Many such 
houses in the medina are built on this well-tried pattern of comfort and 
privacy. In one corner is the kitchen, its noise and smells hidden from the 
central court. At the door stands Maria, Mustapha's wife and a cook of renown. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a day she goes to the market, where the produce is prime, thanks to the 
abundant water from mountain streams. Now, in high summer, glowing mounds of 
apricots, peaches, oranges and the local soft-skinned lemons jostle zucchini 
and eggplant. Tomatoes are small, pock-marked and incomparably sweet. Maria 
likes to make salads of cucumber with mint, green pepper marinated with cumin 
and coriander. She flavors grated carrots with rose water, and sweet potatoes 
with cinnamon and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 The spice market is a world of its own, shaded, redolent, the merchants 
sitting cross-legged with hanging scales in one hand. The butchers, too, are 
apart. The animals -- lambs and goats exclusively -- must be killed and the 
meat cooked on the same day, for refrigeration is rare. Chickens are generally 
tough, well-aged hens from the farmyard, and appreciated as such. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria makes bread twice a day, shaping shallow, round loaves of a simple flour 
and water dough, flavored with salt and raised with a starter from the previous 
batch. The bread is baked at the nearby wood-fired oven. "It tastes different 
that way," she says, introducing me to the cheerful baker. He manipulates a 
10-foot "peel" (a flat shovel for handling the loaves) with ease. To avoid 
confusion, each loaf is personalized; Maria marks hers with three fingers. 
Beside it, there's one in the shape of an hourglass, belonging to a family with 
twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Maria's kitchen, the space is small and the few implements include 
drum sieves of metal and goatskin; a couscous steamer with its accompanying 
straw platter for drying the semolina grains after steaming, and two shallow 
metal drums for cooking warka , paper-thin sheets of pastry dough that resemble 
filo. To make it, Maria slaps a soft yeast dough on the heated drum, then lets 
it bounce back again and again to form a thin layer. As you can imagine, this 
takes time, not to mention skill -- Maria allows two hours just for the 20 
sheets used in bestila , a flat, savory pie filled with braised pigeon and 
almonds and flavored with saffron, cinnamon and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Bestila is almost -- but not quite -- the national dish. When I ask Maria what 
she prepares for the family on Friday, the day of rest, a smile lights her 
face. "Couscous, with lamb, of course, and carrots, turnips, zucchini and white 
cabbage. I flavor it with ginger, pepper and saffron, and finish with plenty of 
chopped fresh coriander. But in our family we never allow harissa (the fiery 
red pepper sauce favored in neighboring Tunisia), as that would overwhelm the 
taste." 
</P>
<P>
 The dish most commonly prepared in her kitchen is tajine , a term referring to 
the conical earthenware casserole that is the universal Moroccan cooking pot. 
Almost anything can be baked inside it -- lamb, goat, fish, with generous 
amounts of vegetables and spices. This recipe calls for chicken with eggplant, 
saffron and lemon juice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the traditional earthenware tajine, you can use a flameproof 
casserole; it should be almost filled by the chicken and eggplant.  
</P>
<P>
 TAJINE OF CHICKEN WITH EGGPLANT 1 (3 1/3- to 4-pound) chicken, cut into 8 
pieces 1 teaspoon ground ginger Generous dash saffron threads 1 garlic clove, 
chopped 1 teaspoon salt, plus extra for eggplant 1 cup water (more if 
necessary) 3 medium eggplant (about 2 1/2 pounds total) 1/3 cup olive oil Juice 
of 1 lemon (about 1/3 cup) 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange chicken pieces in flameproof casserole or tajine. Mix ginger, saffron, 
garlic, salt and 1/2 cup water and pour over chicken. Cover and cook over low 
heat 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, using heat spreader to protect tajine over gas 
flame. If using casserole, check after 1 hour as chicken will cook faster. Stir 
from time to time and add more of remaining 1/2 cup water if chicken seems dry. 
When done, chicken should fall easily from bones. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, trim eggplant. Cut them lengthwise in half, then crosswise into 
3/4-inch slices. Spread slices on tray and sprinkle with salt. Turn slices over 
and sprinkle other side. Leave 1/2 hour to draw out juices. 
</P>
<P>
 Drain eggplant. Rinse with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Arrange 
slices on baking sheet and brush both sides with olive oil, reserving 2 
tablespoons. Bake at 350 degrees until lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Turn 
slices over. Brush again with oil and continue baking until brown and very 
tender, 20 to 25 minutes more. Transfer eggplant to bowl and crush with fork to 
coarse pulp. Stir in 1 tablespoon lemon juice and taste for seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 When chicken is cooked, transfer it with sauce to bowl. Spread eggplant in 
casserole. Place chicken pieces on top. Stir remaining lemon juice into sauce 
and taste for seasoning. Spoon over chicken. Cover and heat gently 8 to 10 
minutes until very hot. (Chicken can be cooked up to 2 days ahead and 
refrigerated. Reheat it in casserole over low heat.) Makes 4 servings.

SWEET AND SPICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer's here, and the time is right for spicy food, especially when made with 
chiles. They make you sweat, which physically cools you off. Chiles also have 
the convenient effect of reducing your body's ability to sense temperature. 
What you don't feel can't bother you. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you accustom yourself to hot spices, you can easily taste other flavors 
across them. The most pleasing combinations, in my opinion, pair something hot 
with something sweet or fruity. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, watermelon with Tabasco sauce is a very pleasing combination. 
Sweet wine and black pepper make a delicious sauce, and a reduction of orange 
juice with green peppercorns blended with butter is terrific with fish. North 
Africans make a condiment called harisa that they add to couscous and tagines 
(stews), often with dates and figs thrown into the pot.  
</P>
<P>
 In Thai cuisine, a soup is commonly made with coconut milk and an incredibly 
spicy green or red curry paste. This is a different approach from the use of 
peppers we see in an Indian mango chutney, where the heat plays second string 
to the sweet mango preserve. In the cuisines of Southeast Asia, the heat is 
often borne by a thin soup or a delicate, almost clear sauce, while Indian 
cuisine in general tends to bury peppers in complex flavors. Personally, I 
always add curry powder and a good dose of Tabasco to commercial chutney, or I 
make my own spicy chutney when mangoes are in the markets.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Western Hemisphere, hot peppers are more often used in condiments and 
uncooked sauces -- salsas. These can range from jalapeno peppers steeped for a 
few weeks in a jar of good vinegar (wine or Sherry vinegar works best) to a 
Mexican tomatillo or tomato salsa to a modern salsa of papaya and lime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the South and Southwest of the United States, we add our heat mostly 
through marinades and barbecue sauces. Then, of course, we have the famous bean 
dishes appropriately named chili.  
</P>
<P>
 So during these dog days of summer, cook cool. Don't heat up the house; go 
outside and grill a steak or a piece of chicken or fish, even some vegetables. 
Or cook early in the day before it gets hot and serve it later, chilled or 
room-temperature.  
</P>
<P>

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; CITY ADOPTS NEW LAW TO FIGHT PROSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A test law to rid the streets of prostitutes' customers has been unanimously 
approved by the City Council, even though vice officers in three cities have 
complained that the law is toothless. 
</P>
<P>
 The law allows police to seize a car when the owner is caught inside engaged 
in an act of prostitution.If the new law proves effective, it would likely be 
expanded to include other cities.  
</P>
<P>
 The law was written for Oakland and San Diego County, then amended to include 
Long Beach, Signal Hill and portions of Los Angeles. Gov. Pete Wilson signed 
the amendment, introduced by Assemblywoman Juanita McDonald (D-Carson), into 
law July 9. Neither Signal Hill nor Los Angeles has adopted an ordinance that 
would put the law into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice officers in San Diego, Oakland and Long Beach have said the law is too 
restrictive to be useful. To seize a car, a customer must be caught twice with 
a prostitute inside, having sex, within the same year and the car can't be the 
family's sole method of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that most johns are caught in sting-type operations and arresting 
one in his own car is rare. EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL NEWS: PASADENA; NAACP CALLS FOR CITY ATTY. TO RESIGN DISCRIMINATION: 
CHAPTER ACCUSES VICTOR KALETA OF BIAS AGAINST FEMALE STAFFERS. THEY SAY CITY 
SHOULD FIRE HIM IF HE DOESN'T QUIT, AND THREATEN LEGAL ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The local chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People 
called Wednesday for the resignation of Pasadena City Atty. Victor Kaleta on 
grounds that he allegedly discriminated against female staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Kaleta refuses to step down, the City Council should fire him, the 
group said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also threatened to take legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in Pasadena just cannot allow this situation," Taylor Morton, president of 
the NAACP's Pasadena chapter, said in an interview. "If the City Council allows 
the city attorney to do this, what kind of a message is it sending to the rest 
of the community?" 
</P>
<P>
 One of the women attorneys Kaleta supervises is black, but the NAACP official 
said his group also is fighting discrimination of any type. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta said in an interview he did not plan to step down. He denied that he 
had discriminated against the female lawyers in his office. But he acknowledged 
a 1992 reorganization left an impression of inequity because two male attorneys 
won promotions after saying they would seek jobs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta said one of his female employees, lawyer Carolyn Williams, who is 
black, was promoted several weeks ago. Further steps are planned to address 
discontent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still some dissatisfaction in the office and I'd like to address 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say they are moving cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our job to get the facts and understand the nuances," Councilman Chris 
Holden said. "We're trying to avoid litigation on all ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Crowfoot recently revealed that Kaleta narrowly survived a "no 
confidence" vote that the council took in a closed session last month. 
Councilmen Crowfoot, Holden and Isaac Richard voted "no confidence" in the city 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three were overruled by Mayor Kathryn Nack and Councilmen Rick Cole, 
William M. Paparian and William E. Thomson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The council majority plans to hire a consultant to review the department's 
management practices and make recommendations for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 In his defense, the city attorney noted he had met the city's affirmative 
action guidelines for hiring women and minorities in his office. Kaleta also 
said the controversial reorganization was reviewed by various city officials 
and approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Kaleta was triggered by a December, 1993, memo, which was 
written by an unidentified staffer, complaining of disparate treatment of 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 A consultant hired by the council found women lawyers in the civil branch of 
the city attorney's office suffered discrimination when it came to promotions, 
salaries, bonuses and fringe benefits.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LYNWOOD; RAIDS ON WATER FUND BLAMED FOR RATE HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have acknowledged that they approved a 75% increase in water 
rates partly to offset years of raids by the city on water revenues for other 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past seven years, the city has diverted more than $4.5 million in water 
revenues, city officials said.The raids on the water fund, coupled with higher 
prices to purchase water from the Metropolitan Water District, created a 
deficit in the water fund that prompted the increase, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 A divided Lynwood City Council recently approved a $49-million city budget 
that includes the higher water rates. Two of the five council members walked 
out of the meeting in protest of the rate hike, among other things. The three 
remaining members -- Mayor Paul H. Richards II, Louis Heine and Louis Byrd -- 
approved the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is just ripping off the water fund," Councilman Robert Henning said. 
He and Councilman Armando Rea left the meeting after protesting the rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other city officials defended the use of water revenues for other purposes, 
saying the maneuver prevented budget cuts or increases in other taxes. They 
also said other cities have done the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had not done this we would have had a half-million-dollar deficit in 
the general fund and would have had to cut police or fire services or raise 
other taxes," said finance director Alfretta Earnest. JOHN D. WAGNER

 ALHAMBRA: A firefighters' pancake breakfast at a fire station has ignited 
controversy after one City Council candidate said she was ejected while other 
candidates were able to use the event as a photo opportunity. Elizabeth Mack, 
who is running against Paul Talbot for the open 5th District seat, said her 1st 
Amendment rights were violated when firefighters ejected her from the facility 
for distributing political flyers.While Mack was being ejected, Mayor Boyd G. 
Condie, incumbent Councilwoman Barbara A. Messina, 1st District candidate Mark 
Paulson and Talbot turned pancakes for photographers. Paulson and Talbot are 
allies of the incumbents. The breakfast was held to support a foundation for 
burn victims.

 DUARTE: The City Council has withdrawn a November ballot measure that would 
have allowed voters to decide whether to implement a 3% utility tax. Responding 
to the decision, leaders of the Duarte Taxpayers Group said they will stage a 
recall effort against the entire council if it tries to implement the tax 
without a citywide vote.

 TEMPLE CITY: Hugh Riley, who has served as city manager for Hollister, Calif., 
and Tucumcari, N.M., will take over as the city's chief executive before Sept. 
1, Mayor Harry Budds said. In closed session, the City Council selected Riley, 
45, to replace Denise Ovrom, who resigned from the position in April. Riley, a 
20-year municipal employee and Vietnam War veteran, was Hollister's city 
manager until April, when he resigned after a new council was elected.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; COUNCIL TO WEIGH BAN ON ROADSIDE SOLICITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has voted unanimously to consider a proposal that would ban 
people from asking motorists for work or money at street corners. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was introduced by Councilman Douglas S. Drummond, who said that 
solicitors often create traffic problems at busy intersections in the city's 
east side.The ordinance would also apply to people selling items such as 
flowers or fruit at intersections, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a roadway situation that impedes traffic and creates danger for the 
person soliciting and the drivers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond said a similar ordinance in the city of Agoura Hills has survived 
court challenges because it bans solicitations at intersections but does not 
outlaw them entirely.  
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Blesofsky, treasurer of an advocacy group called the Homeless 
Organizing Committee, said the proposal is an infringement on free speech that 
unfairly targets the city's homeless. "The First Amendment guarantees certain 
rights, and that includes the right to hold a 'Will work for food,' sign," he 
said. JOHN POPE

ANXIOUS FAMILY SEEKS BONE MARROW DONOR FOR AILING DAUGHTER; MEDICINE: LEUKEMIA 
PATIENT MONICA SHEK, 6, WILL GO INTO AN INCURABLE RELAPSE IN FIVE MONTHS UNLESS 
A MATCH IS FOUND, DOCTORS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bursting with happy energy, Monica Shek is flitting among her toys; twirling a 
Hula-Hoop, switching on a model train and rearranging stuffed animals -- a 
snuggly bear, the toy sea lion she sleeps with and a windup parrot that croaks 
"hello." 
</P>
<P>
 His eyes following her around the room, Oliver Shek regards all this excited 
motion with a father's doting adoration. But a hint of apprehension lies behind 
his gaze, as if Monica were some rare vision that might disappear at any 
instant. 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 6, Monica is nearing a crossroads in her struggle with leukemia, 
the disease that has ravaged her since she was 2 years old. Three times, 
doctors have battled the disease into remission. But ultimately, chemotherapy 
has failed to halt the growth of cancer cells. Now it appears that only a 
bone-marrow transplant can cure her. Without one, her doctor believes, Monica 
has five months -- at the most -- until medication fails to control the disease 
and she falls into a final, incurable relapse. 
</P>
<P>
 With no sisters or brothers, though, the chance of finding a donor who matches 
her marrow type are about 1 in 10,000, her doctor says. There are 1.3 million 
potential donors listed with the National Marrow Donor Program Registry, but 
only 56,000, or 4%, are Asian, says Jennifer Sugimoto of Asians for Miracle 
Marrow Matches, a recruitment arm of the national donor program. Even fewer are 
Chinese or Chinese Americans. Although it is possible to find a match among any 
ethnic group, marrow types are genetically determined and it is more likely to 
find a similar type within a patient's ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of preliminary matches have been found for Monica; more testing must 
be performed to see whether any of these is a perfect match. 
</P>
<P>
 Momentarily abandoning her playthings, Monica flings herself against her 
father, snuggling her face against his waist. Caressing the wispy hair that 
remains on her head after chemotherapy, Shek says softly: "After the diagnosis 
we treasured her more because we know there's no guarantee. We know that she 
might not be around too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Monica was found to have leukemia in August, 1990, while still a toddler. Her 
parents' shock and grief at the diagnosis was softened by the information that 
the cure rate for children is 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 After a hospital stay at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles, she began 2 1/2 
years of outpatient chemotherapy. Her mother, Winnie, quit her job as a 
waitress to be a full-time caretaker to her ailing child. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very tough for me," Winnie Shek says. "The hardest part was when I heard 
she had leukemia. I felt very bad, very sad." 
</P>
<P>
 The course of treatment was nearly over in July, 1992, when her physician, Dr. 
Judith Sato, detected cancer cells in her bone marrow, signaling a relapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica's second course of treatment combined chemotherapy and radiation, a 
more aggressive regimen that required intermittent hospital stays, Sato says. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors and nurses, spinal taps and blood tests, formed the backdrop of her 
childhood. Although she had some friends, her father says, the time she could 
spend with them was limited. Her immune system, weakened by chemotherapy, could 
not withstand microbes that would barely bring on sniffles in a healthy child. 
On a couple of occasions, she was hospitalized with fever, Shek says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, when she was on chemotherapy she had no white cells at all," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rigors of treatment, Monica entered kindergarten last fall. That 
time was the happiest in her life -- her first glimpse of normal childhood 
life. At the same time, she patiently submitted to the sometimes-painful 
procedures that sustained her family's hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's real good about getting chemotherapy and oral medication," Shek says. 
"To her, it's part of her life. She knows she has to take it because she wants 
to get well. . . . That's all she knows. That she's sick and she may be able to 
get well." 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents and doctor preserve her hope by keeping her real chances of 
survival to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Sato once again discovered cancerous cells in Monica's marrow -- her 
second relapse. Even stronger medication put the disease into remission again, 
but at this stage in the disease, chemotherapy can only control the growth of 
cancer cells for a limited time. Sato says that after each relapse the cancer 
cells become more resistant to treatment. The longest anyone has survived this 
stage of leukemia without a marrow transplant is eight months, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her prognosis is very poor," Sato says. "It's very unlikely that she can 
survive unless we can find a marrow donor." 
</P>
<P>
 Shek has been searching for a donor since then. He contacted the marrow 
registry in Hong Kong, as well as an Asian marrow-donor group in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing that my child is going to pass away, I feel extremely sorrowful, 
confused and angry," he wrote in a plea through the latter group. "Whenever we 
think that she is leaving us and think of the wonderful times we spent with 
her, we feel that there is no hope in life. We cry continuously. However, I 
said to my wife that we cannot give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Registered marrow donors take a blood test that measures three types of 
proteins that indicate marrow tissue type. The test remains on record, and if a 
patient with those same proteins needs a transfer, the donor is given a second 
blood test to determine if the match is complete. If the donor agrees to go 
ahead with the transfer, doctors extract a small amount of bone marrow from 
their pelvic bone, Sugimoto says. The procedure is of little risk to the donor 
and the marrow regenerates in three to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 30, the Hong Kong registry notified the Sheks that they had found 
records of 19 preliminary matches, and the U.S. donor registry found four. But 
it may be several months, Shek says, before they locate the donors and learn if 
any fits Monica's marrow type. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugimoto says that because of the small pool of Asians in the national 
registry, chances of a match are still tenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so many different combinations of (proteins), we would need a million 
Asians on the registry in order for all Asians to have a good chance of having 
a match," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 People of Asian descent make up 10% of the U.S. population, Sugimoto said, but 
only 4% of the marrow donor registration. Reluctance to donate among Asians is 
partly due to a lack of education about the procedure, she said, and partly to 
cultural taboos against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People, especially new immigrants, are not accustomed to donating any parts 
of their bodies," she said. "It's almost considered bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Shek, though, implores Asians to consider marrow donation, if not for Monica, 
for another Asian child who needs it. What might be feared as bad luck would 
be, rather, a fantastic stroke of fortune to his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just keep hoping that the cure is there," he said. "This is a very special 
thing. It comes from within you."

WRONGFUL-DEATH SUIT FILED AGAINST MILLER BREWERY; HEALTH: WIFE OF FORMER WORKER 
CLAIMS THAT POLICY ALLOWING DRINKING AT JOB SITE LED TO HUSBAND'S DEATH FROM 
LIVER DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The widow of a 50-year-old Glendora man who died last year of complications 
from alcoholic liver disease has filed a lawsuit against his employer of 17 
years, Miller Brewing Co. in Irwindale, which used to allow employees to drink 
on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Hurst, 50, says her husband, Thomas, who died June 21, 1993, became an 
alcoholic because the brewery encouraged its employees to drink beer during 
breaks and at lunch, gave them free beer at Christmas and on their birthdays 
and provided cases of beer at discounted prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "They condoned it and they expected me to handle it," Hurst said. "He would be 
here today if he had never gotten that job to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
 The wrongful-death lawsuit, filed June 10 in Pomona Superior Court, also 
alleges that Miller Brewing Co. violated California health and safety laws that 
prohibit employers from knowingly and without warning exposing their workers to 
toxic substances. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the brewery in Irwindale declined to comment on the 
lawsuit, as did Dianne Markut, a spokeswoman at the company's headquarters in 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Markut did say that Miller for many years was concerned about 
on-the-premises employee consumption of alcohol, even though free beer was 
regarded as a job benefit. The brewery was one of the industry leaders seeking 
to change the policy, Markut said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurst said the change came too late for her husband. By the time the Irwindale 
plant banned on-the-premises drinking in 1990, Thomas Hurst had developed liver 
disease and had only 10% of normal liver capacity. A back injury on the job in 
1993 led to his hospitalization and death three days later from a blood 
infection when his impaired liver could not filter out the toxins, his wife 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurst's attorney, Russell Thomas of Santa Ana, said he believes the lawsuit is 
the first of its kind filed in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, Irene Dueweke, widow of brewery employee Richard Dueweke, sought 
$100,000 from the Stroh's brewery in Detroit, alleging that her husband's death 
was related to alcoholism caused by the free beer given him at his job. 
Dueweke's claim was later rejected, said Lacey Logan, a Stroh's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 But that case and lobbying from Mothers Against Drunk Driving made major 
brewery companies concerned about possible lawsuits from employees. In the 
mid-1980s, they began abolishing drinking on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, only Coors in Golden, Colo., and a handful of micro-breweries still 
permit workers to drink on the job. Coors is reviewing its policy after an 
accident March 11 in which employee Alfredo Rodriguez, 55, died after he drove 
his car at 70 m.p.h. into a post at the brewery. Rodriguez' blood alcohol level 
was 0.319, three times higher than the state's drunk-driving limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite policies forbidding on-site drinking, many breweries still provide 
beer at discount prices to employees, but Miller spokesman Victor Franco in 
Irwindale said that that particular plant does not do so. Employees can buy up 
to four cases a week at the company store, he said, but pay prices that are 
often higher than they could find at retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The company still provides a free case of beer on each employee's birthday, 
Franco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Beitman, a Massachusetts attorney who has focused on cases involving 
alcohol-related injuries and illnesses, said that most product liability cases 
against the manufacturers of alcoholic beverages fail because the dangers of 
drinking to excess are well known and considered the responsibility of the 
drinker. However, if an employer openly tolerated and fostered regular drinking 
in the workplace, and if discounted beer were an employee benefit, that would 
give the case more clout, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the onset of his disease, Hurst, a former bottler, was put to work 
picking up cans in the parking lot, mopping stairs and other duties, his wife 
said. While engaged in those tasks, he got caught in a piece of machinery and 
injured his back on June 18, 1993, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his brewery job, her husband worked as a salesman and consumed alcohol 
but not excessively, Janice Hurst said. After working for years at Miller 
plants in Azusa and Irwindale, her husband drank a case of beer a day, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company looked the other way when workers filched beer from the production 
lines, let them drink at lunch and breaks, allowed them to purchase at discount 
prices four cases of beer monthly and gave them a case of beer at Christmas and 
on birthdays, she said. As a result, her husband came home drunk nearly every 
day after work, passed out numerous times on the job, drank after work in the 
parking lot, drove drunk and was convicted of drunken driving, Hurst said. He 
was deaf to her complaints about his drinking, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband wanted to drink all the time," she said. "He just couldn't get his 
fill." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, after he was sent to an alcohol rehabilitation program paid for by 
the brewing company, he stopped drinking, Hurst said. But by that time, his 
liver was severely damaged. He also appeared to have suffered brain damage and 
he was relieved of his bottling job at the plant, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurst said that after her husband's death, she found a photograph of him taken 
at work, pulling on his work shoes with a can of Miller beer beside him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had it blown up . . . and I gave it to my (adult) children and said, 'Don't 
drink like that,' " she said. "It's just an awful thing to watch somebody go 
through that and watch them die from liquor like that."

COUNCIL ASSERTS MORE CONTROL; MONTEREY PARK: THE CITY'S ACTION TO DEAL WITH 
COMMISSION SQUABBLES COMES AFTER ANOTHER ROUND OF TESTIMONY IN WHICH THE 
LIBRARY BOARD PRESIDENT WAS CONDEMNED FOR HER CRITICISM OF A TRUSTEE'S CHINESE 
ACCENT. 
</P>

<P>
 After a second round of public testimony condemning Library Board President 
Kathleen Brzozowski for her criticism of another trustee's Chinese accent, the 
City Council has voted to assert more authority over squabbles on city 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision Monday came as the council acknowledged it had few options to 
settle a racially charged dispute between Brzozowski and trustee Marina Tse 
because the library board is independent of council control. The Brzozowski-Tse 
dispute was sparked by the forced resignation of Jeanette Cheng, the city's 
first Chinese American librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheng was asked to resign last April and accepted a $60,000 severance package 
to step down. But because of her lone opposition to Cheng's resignation, Tse 
claimed Brzozowski and other board members were attempting to use a city law on 
absences to get her off the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's so-called "three absences" ordinance allows the library board and 
other citizen committees to remove members after three unexcused absences. 
</P>
<P>
 Brzozowski denied the allegation by Tse. But her additional comments about 
Tse's accent, attendance record and ability to serve on the board sparked 
criticism from community and civil rights groups and calls for a public apology 
and Brzozowski's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the criticism continued. "Racism has again reared its ugly head and 
this time it is in the form of Kathleen Brzozowski," said Gay Wong, a community 
activist who is a professor of language and literacy development. 
</P>
<P>
 The council moved into one part of the dispute, agreeing to amend the "three 
absences" ordinance with the clause "subject to council approval." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make it clear that there has to be a higher level of authority" in 
administering city boards, said Mayor Judy Chu. 
</P>
<P>
 Brzozowski and Tse did not attend Monday's council meeting. Tse is out of town 
and could not be reached for comment. Brzozowski left Tuesday on a 
city-sponsored junket to Monterey Park's sister cities in Taiwan and China and 
also could not be reached for comment. Chu also is a member of that delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's made the trip real difficult," Chu said after the Monday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Tse's supporters packed the library board's monthly meeting. The 
issue of Brzozowski's comments was not on the board agenda, however, and 
trustees were prohibited by state law from taking any action despite demands by 
several Chinese American and Latino civil rights leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 A personal plea by Tse also did not prompt Brzozowski to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never used such terms as 'racist' and I am not critical of anybody's 
accent," Brzozowski said during the board's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But the day before that meeting, Brzozowski told a reporter Tse's accent makes 
her disruptive at meetings. Brzozowski also did not deny telling The Times: Tse 
"seems to have a problem understanding English." 
</P>
<P>
 Tse is a highly honored special education teacher who received her master's 
degree from the University of Southern California and has taught English as a 
Second Language for the past 17 years. She was recently appointed to the state 
Special Education Commission by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "My language is not only sufficient, I have mastered it," Tse said last week.

CRACKDOWN ON RESTAURANT SMOKING GETS RESULTS

 Some Long Beach business owners who openly defied the city's new no-smoking 
ordinance have begun to comply after health inspectors made several visits to 
their facilities, according to city documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Health inspectors visited five businesses in late July and reported that three 
have begun to comply with the ordinance.The health department will visit two 
more businesses in the near future, said Judy Ross, who is in charge of 
enforcing the ban for the health department. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers at the establishments said they are begrudgingly cooperating to avoid 
prosecution. Violators can be fined up to $50 for the first offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to give in because we don't want to pay all those fines," said Lois 
Johnson, manager of the Twin Wheels Steak House on the city's west side. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophia Riley, who owns Huff's Coffee Shop on Wardlow Road, said she has 
complied and has launched a campaign touting Huff's as a smoke-free restaurant. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Managers at Java Lanes bowling alley, who estimated that business has declined 
25%, said they have complied with the ban to appease health inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Two establishments visited by inspectors, the Prospector Family Restaurant on 
Anaheim Street and Loof's Amusements, a downtown game parlor, continue to 
violate the law by allowing customers to smoke, city documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose-Luis Lemus, the Prospector's owner, said he would rather pay a $50 fine 
than lose between $300 and $400 a day by banning smoking. "If they receive one 
more complaint on me they will refer me to the prosecutor," Lemus said.  
</P>
<P>
 Loof's has started to limit smoking, and plans to eliminate it completely 
within a week, said Al Brown, the manager.

BOND ISSUE PLAN DRAWS CRITICISM FROM ACTIVISTS; POLITICS: IN EFFORT TO COMPLY 
WITH MANDATE TO MAKE CITY MORE ACCESSIBLE TO DISABLED, LONG BEACH WILL PLACE 
THE MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. FOES CALL IT A DELAYING TACTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Long Beach City Council, struggling to comply with a federal mandate to 
make the city more accessible for the disabled, has decided to place a 
$48-million bond issue on the November ballot to raise money for the 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous council vote last week drew criticism from disabled-rights 
activists who described the bond issue as a delaying tactic because it stands 
little chance of being approved. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials "are buying time so they can elude the tough budget-cutting 
choices," said Marilyn Tradewell, whose son Robbie has used a wheelchair since 
an auto accident left him partially paralyzed five years ago. "It allows them 
to hide behind the legal protection that they're acting in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members acknowledged that the bond measure, which needs a 
two-thirds' vote to pass, may face tough odds at the ballot box. In an effort 
to improve the measure's chances, the council voted Tuesday to delay a separate 
$95-million bond issue to finance a new police headquarters and other public 
safety projects. 
</P>
<P>
 However, council members said, the city must show some good-faith effort to 
begin the work by January, 1995, under the federal Americans With Disabilities 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I'm not totally happy about putting this on the ballot, I just don't 
see any alternative," said Councilman Thomas J. Clark at the council meeting. 
"The money just isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Doris Topsy-Elvord said she was skeptical that the measure would 
obtain the required approval of two-thirds of the voters. Councilman Jeffrey A. 
Kellogg said he thought it was the best the city could do "in an extremely 
difficult situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The ADA, as the sweeping law is known, requires that all city facilities, bus 
stops, streets and sidewalks be made accessible to disabled people by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, that will mean spending an estimated $12.6 million to upgrade 
224 public facilities, including the Queen Mary and the Convention Center; 
about $26.7 million for curb ramps at about 4,500 intersections, and about $4.4 
million to upgrade more than 2,100 bus stops, said Dolores Barrows, the city's 
ADA compliance officer. The remaining funds from the bond measure would cover 
related expenses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we won't be in compliance (by 1995), we have to have something in 
place," Barrows said. "The bottom line is that this is a federal law, and 
cities have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 After Jan. 26, 1995, Long Beach could face fines of up to $50,000 for each 
instance where a structure or public walkway is not accessible, Barrows said, 
or be ordered by a judge to make the changes. The fines could be less, however, 
if a judge determined the city had made a "good faith effort" to comply, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Rockwell, a Long Beach resident who uses a wheelchair, said he agreed with 
the council's decision to issue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters should understand that this is the easiest way for the city to get 
full accessibility, the least risky of other methods, and will ultimately save 
the taxpayers money," Rockwell said. "With some of these streets, you can count 
up five violations in a few blocks, and that could be (hundreds of thousands) 
in fines right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell said that Long Beach has numerous obstacles for people who must use 
wheelchairs -- from sidewalks that cannot be navigated to public restrooms that 
have steps leading to the doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the ADA took effect in 1992, the city has hired a full-time ADA 
coordinator and spent about $1.5 million in improvements, including making City 
Hall restrooms accessible and adding a hydraulic lift at the Belmont Plaza 
Pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal said that the bond issue -- a 20-year general 
obligation bond to be paid by property tax assessments -- will not relieve the 
city of its obligation to make facilities accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bond issue fails, Lowenthal said, the city will have to pay for the 
improvements over a longer term, probably through a combination of budget cuts, 
tax assessments and federal Housing and Community Development Block Grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Douglas S. Drummond said the bond measure should not be seen as a 
city attempt to pass the buck onto the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a responsibility and one way or another we'll pay for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ADA was designed to give the estimated 43 million disabled Americans equal 
access to jobs, transportation and public facilities. The statute also bans 
discrimination against the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Torrez, the city's director of financial management, said Long Beach 
voters have never approved the type of taxable, general obligation bond issue 
that is proposed. The bond issue, if approved, would increase property taxes by 
about $30 to $35 a year on a $150,000 home for 20 years.

<P>
 A state commission has granted historic landmark status to Marine Stadium, the 
Long Beach inland waterway created for Olympic rowing competitions in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 The mile-long channel, carved from a saltwater bog, is the first man-made 
rowing facility made for Olympic competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic designation, approved this week by the nine-member state Historic 
Resources Commission, recognizes the site as having "exceptional importance and 
a high level of historic value," said Ruthann Lehrer, Long Beach's historic 
preservation officer. "It means a place is . . . the first, the only or the 
most unique of its kind." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the status does not give Marine Stadium special protection from any 
future development, Lehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Stadium has played host to three U.S. Olympic rowing trials and 
numerous aquatic championships, as well as recreational boating, swimming and 
rowing.  
</P>
<P>
 During the 1932 Olympics, which coincided with the Great Depression, many 
out-of-work fans came to Marine Stadium and climbed nearby oil derricks to 
watch eight U.S. rowers win gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowing enthusiast Larry Goodhue, who has pushed for several years to have 
Marine Stadium given historic status, said the designation "commemorates the 
first time in history that Long Beach was put on the world stage." JOHN POPE

 Students who live too far from a state university to attend part-time programs 
or those who just want to study from home may now earn a master's degree in 
business from their living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Dominguez Hills will start a program this fall that allows students 
to watch TV broadcasts of all 15 classes required for a master's degree in 
business administration.Channel 58 will air the programs. The classes will be 
offered from 9 a.m. to noon every Saturday and Sunday starting Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes will be taught at the Carson campus, and some students will attend the 
weekend lectures. Students watching from home will be able to call in to the 
class by telephone and interact with instructors, and submit course work by 
modem. The first two classes will be "Business Economics" and "Finance and 
Business Management and Marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 Every seven weeks, students will gather at the Dominguez Hills campus to meet 
with instructors and other students. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for the program is $199 per unit. School officials estimate it will 
take most students 2 1/2 years to complete the 45-unit degree. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is open to students who earned a bachelor's degree with a 
grade-point average of at least 2.75 in their last 60 units. Students also must 
score 450 or higher on the Graduate Management Admission Test.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CERRITOS; ABC SCHOOL DISTRICT TOLD TO TRIM BUDGET

<TEXT>
<P>
 County education officials have ordered the ABC Unified School District to 
trim $2.3 million from its $69-million spending plan for the new school year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to ABC officials last week, county schools Supt.Stuart E. Gothold 
said the district overestimated revenues from the state in a number of areas, 
including special and adult education. The county also rejected district plans 
to cut costs in computer services and worker's compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they are concerned about the school board's reluctance 
to make budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has defended a new teachers contract that increases salaries and 
reduces class sizes, but county officials have refused to approve the contract 
until the district can show that it can afford the increased costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This board is in denial, and they're going to have to face it in real budget 
cuts," said Wes Bosson, a fiscal adviser assigned by the county to the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The board must submit a revised spending plan by Sept. 8. County officials 
eventually would impose budget cuts of their own if the board continues to 
submit unacceptable spending plans, Bosson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ABC school board also has named Robert W. Purvis, former Simi Valley 
Unified School superintendent, to head the 20,600-student school system until a 
permanent school chief is selected. Purvis replaces Deputy Supt. Ira Toibin, 
who had served as interim superintendent after the board ousted Supt. Larry 
Lucas. Toibin resigned two weeks ago. PSYCHE PASCUAL

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST AREA; DONATION BEARS FRUIT FOR SENIOR CITIZENS

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to bring attention to the poor nutritional habits and medical 
needs among the elderly, a massive donation of fresh fruit was made last week 
to more than 5,000 senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty tons of fruit were donated by San Joaquin Valley peach and nectarine 
growers in conjunction with the nonprofit Fresno Food Bank.The food bank 
arranged to have the fruit sorted, bagged and delivered to Southern California. 
Qwik Way Trucking of Vernon donated transportation for the local distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not every day we get such a treat," said Juanita Mansilia, 79, one of 
about 100 fruit recipients at the Bonelli Senior Center in Huntington Park. 
"Far more of this fruit is needed if we're to remain healthy and active." 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Gonzales, director of the Fresno Food Bank, said this is the start of a 
mutually beneficial relationship between Southern California senior citizen 
groups, the food bank and growers.  
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizen groups from Artesia, Bell, Bell Gardens, Cudahy, Hawaiian 
Gardens, Huntington Park, Lynwood, Maywood and South Gate participated at 
community centers, where thousands of the elderly participate in state-funded 
supplemental meal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are about 1.5 million seniors living in Los Angeles County, and an 
estimated 130,000 are living below the poverty line," said Sandy Stanko, 
project director for the Oldtimers Foundation, which regularly distributes food 
at the Huntington Park center. The foundation, established in 1964, serves 
nearly 750,000 meals annually to the elderly in Los Angeles and San Bernardino 
counties at nutrition sites as well as to those who are homebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales said that fruit distribution programs provide growers with an outlet 
for edible fruit that may not be marketable "due to low prices or because the 
fruit is blemished, misshapen or too ripe to transport long distances to 
market." SIMON ROMERO

 Each of Sunny Slope Water Co.'s 85,000 customers owns at least one share of 
stock in the nonprofit firm, with the option to buy more and reduce monthly 
water bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But few realize that Sunny Slope, in its 100th year of business, is possibly 
the oldest municipal water company in Southern California,  
</P>
<P>
 The company still is based in the same place: a 15-acre spot in Pasadena that 
bears signs of history long before Sunny Slope was founded. 
</P>
<P>
 Local historian William A. Myers wrote a book about Sunny Slope and credits 
luck and timely infrastructure upgrades for the district's century of survival. 
Sunny Slope was able to send its water farther with the earliest hints of 
growing suburban sprawl. It now serves parts of San Gabriel, San Marino, 
Pasadena, Temple City and a 22,000-acre county strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was created by the same phenomenon that drew the Gabrieleno 
Indians to the spot about 750 years ago: lakes filled by springs that were 
forced above ground by the Raymond Fault. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager and Vice President Michael Hart is so proud of the 
history-filled land where the district headquarters sit that he crafted a 
wrought-iron gate for the entryway to celebrate Sunny Slope's centennial. Past 
the gate is a pond full of bass, bluegill and crawfish, surrounded by cattails 
taller than most people. The Indians used these tules to build their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Spaniards came, missionaries used Indian labor to harness the spring 
water with a dam and irrigation canals, built more than 175 years ago to serve 
the San Gabriel Mission and its Old Mill, which still survives in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 A low wall bears moss-covered palm prints left by the workers as they built 
the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Slope was purchased by an English syndicate in 1887 and became a water 
company on Jan. 7, 1895, to serve the land the syndicate had subdivided. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the natural springs dried up and deep wells were needed to pull 
water to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1937, Sunny Slope was one of 26 local water companies named as a defendant 
when Pasadena sued for water rights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal cities sued in 1959 when ground-water levels had been drained to below 
sea level, affecting the coast's water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of water San Gabriel customers withdraw from the ground every year 
is limited by the decision resulting from that battle. Now Sunny Slope bolsters 
its water supply by purchasing about 500 acre-feet of water each year from the 
Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 Facilities have been modernized over the years. Electric pumps sound like a 
Yosemite waterfall as they churn out 4,500 gallons of water a minute to feed 
four dams. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hart has tried to bring back the glory days of the estate with his 
landscaping project, adding the lake and a stream as well as a hilly cactus 
garden and a field of wild flowers.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside the company's hallways are a small museum of old maps, photographs and 
tools. Hart says he plans to offer tours, by appointment about three times a 
year.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PALOS VERDES ESTATES; PHONE SURVEY'S AIM IS TO IMPROVE LIBRARY

<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates residents will talk libraries this week, when a telephone 
survey on how to improve the Malaga Cove Library is scheduled to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Aug. 13, the Malaga Cove Library Neighborhood Planning Committee plans 
to call 150 library users and 100 non-users, said Dwyn Robbie, who is 
overseeing the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 20 questions the committee will ask is "What do you like best about 
going to the Malaga Cove Library?" Questionnaires will also be available at the 
library, Robbie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbie, who is also a member of the watchdog group Save Our Libraries, hopes 
the survey will uncover ways to improve library attendance so Palos Verdes 
Library District trustees do not shut down Malaga Cove Library or cut its 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The library committee plans to release the survey results early in September, 
Robbie said. JEFF KASS

<P>
 A controversial Rio Hondo Community College instructor accused of slandering 
an administrator and engaging in other improper activities has agreed to 
resign, college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Criscione, 44, a geology instructor for 14 years at the college, said the 
college agreed to pay him cash as part of the settlement, but he would not 
reveal details.He said, however, that his resignation did not constitute an 
admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Wood, the college's interim president, refused to discuss the agreement, 
saying employee matters are confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 At Criscione's hearing in April, the college's board of trustees read the 
charges, including allegations that Criscione falsely accused a male dean of 
sexual harassment, forged a California Faculty Assn. officer's signature and 
wrote a threatening letter to a fellow instructor. Criscione denied the 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings were conducted in public at his request. Several students who 
attended said the popular instructor should be allowed to keep his job. JOHN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Gray Panthers of Greater Los Angeles Inc., an organization that promotes 
intergenerational understanding and combats age discrimination, has moved its 
regional headquarters to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's ethnic, age and economic differences, along with its proximity to 
the South Bay and Orange County, were key to the decision to relocate from 
Studio City, said Cherie A. Lebrun, the regional president. 
</P>
<P>
 The new office oversees chapters in Orange, Torrance, Santa Monica, Studio 
City, Long Beach and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington-based nonprofit group accepts members of all ages and is 
discussing a name change to Panthers International to offset its seniors-only 
image, Lebrun said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 44, Lebrun is the youngest-ever Los Angeles regional president. She was 
elected to the post in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The panthers were founded by Maggie Kuhn, now 89, in 1970 to protest the 
Vietnam War and to lobby against age discrimination as well as sexism and 
racism. There are about 2,500 Gray Panthers in Southern California and 40,000 
nationwide, said Todd E. Gossert, national membership coordinator. JOHN CANALIS

<P>
 The ABC Unified School District and an Orange County developer last week 
cleared the first of several hurdles required to begin construction on a gated 
residential community on 13 acres of district land next to Whitney High School. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The planning commission recently approved a tentative tract map to create 61 
residential lots on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district last year entered into a partnership with Costa Mesa-based 
Warmington Homes to develop the land to raise money for repairs and 
construction of classrooms. District officials have said they hope to receive 
$7.7 million from the deal, which includes payment for the land and a 
percentage of the profits from the homes once they are sold.  
</P>
<P>
 Those profits could be somewhat diminished, however, since the developer was 
asked by the city recently to increase the size of the lots and include more 
space between homes. The original proposal consisted of 66 lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary plans for the residential community include four floor plans, each 
encompassing 2,500 to 2,700 square feet. The developers said they hope to sell 
the homes for $350,000 to $375,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The tract map must be approved by the city council, which will take up the 
issue at its Aug. 18 meeting. The planning commission and council also must 
approve specific design plans for the homes.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the first homes could be completed by the end of 1995.

TOPICS / WORKING; TELECOMMUTING OFFERS A BREATHER FROM TRAFFIC

 Holly Noel's job is to encourage her fellow workers for the city of Alhambra 
to choose alternative modes of transportation to cut the number of daily 
smog-creating commutes. And if teaching by example counts, Noel is doing a 
great job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Apple Valley resident recently started telecommuting, working close to 
home and doing her job by telephone, computer and fax. 
</P>
<P>
 By doing so, Noel avoids a commute of 85 miles each way. Instead, she drives 
to the neighboring town of Hesperia, where she has a desk at that city's Fire 
Prevention Bureau. Her spot there was made available through a project for 
cities called "Telecommunications for Clean Air." 
</P>
<P>
 "This offers a unique opportunity for local governments to use 
telecommunications strategies and technologies to improve air quality and 
traffic congestion," said Noel, who has worked for the Transportation Division 
of Public Works Department since November. 
</P>
<P>
 Her supervisor, Christine Montan, said Noel was an ideal candidate for 
telecommuting, partly because she lives so far from work and partly because 
much of her job involves writing and analyzing reports, work that can be done 
independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra officials agreed to participate in the project to meet South Coast 
Air Quality Management District regulations requiring employers to shorten the 
number of vehicle miles traveled by employees and thereby reduce emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work tasks assigned are being completed in a timely manner and thus far, 
the project seems to be a success for all concerned," Montan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The suggested donation for general admission to the Huntington Library and 
Gardens has been increased by $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
 A decrease in interest from bonds, which help fund Huntington's $12-million 
budget, has forced officials to rely more heavily on the suggested donations, 
according to Catherine Babcock, Huntington's communication director. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500,000 tourists annually visit the 75-year-old botanical garden, art 
collection and scholarly library. 
</P>
<P>
 As of July 12, the donation asked for general admission has been raised to 
$7.50 apiece, up from $5.  
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens 65 and older are asked to donate $6, up from $5, and youth 
ages 12 to 18 contribute $4, up from $3. Children under 12 are free. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources of income are fund-raising activities, an in-house restaurant 
and a gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The library and gardens is open Tuesdays through Fridays, 1 to 4:30 p.m., and 
Saturdays and Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. It is closed on Mondays. For 
more information: (818) 405-2100.

 The Levitt family's plan to donate two acres of land to Rolling Hills Estates 
was stymied recently by the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council.  
</P>
<P>
 The vacant land near Silver Spur Road, which is zoned commercial, is in Rancho 
Palos Verdes, but the Levitts wanted to donate it and an adjoining parcel to 
neighboring Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rancho Palos Verdes Council voted unanimously to keep the land within 
their city to maintain control over any future development, which could affect 
nearby homeowners and bring in tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 By donating the land, the Levitts would probably gain tax benefits, according 
to a Rancho Palos Verdes city report. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter signed by their attorney says the Levitts plan to donate an adjoining 
acre already in Rolling Hills Estates to that city. The letter encourages 
Rolling Hills Estates to maintain the three-plus acres as open space, or to 
trade it for open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes does not plan to rezone its land as open space, said City 
Manager Paul D. Bussey, but a city report does not predict any development on 
the hilly acres. The report says the city approved applications to develop the 
land in 1986, but the project never materialized. JEFF KASS

 The city will receive $3.5 million in federal funds to repair earthquake 
damage to a King Harbor parking lot, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency agreed to pay for all the repairs to 
the lot, which suffered extensive damage when the soil underneath was saturated 
with water during the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to reconstruct a 500-foot section of a seawall and rock mound 
that moved 17 feet horizontally as a result of the earthquake. In addition, 
utility lines and a nearby sidewalk require repairs, said City Engineer Desi 
Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also is negotiating with federal officials for $3 million in 
emergency funds to reconstruct the Seaside Lagoon, a popular salt-water 
swimming spot damaged in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the city made $60,000 in temporary repairs to the lagoon, 
which is near the harbor. The lagoon has been open to swimmers since June.

 Despite the protests of some Marina City Club condominium owners, including 
Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, a federal bankruptcy judge has agreed 
to a reorganization plan that allows the developer and homeowners to share 
management of the troubled waterfront complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners association and lawyers for the partnership led by developer 
Jerome Snyder agreed to the plan Wednesday.Holden and a lawyer for two dozen 
other homeowners had asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Samuel Bufford for more time 
to work out a better deal for the homeowners, who contend that lax management 
since the bankruptcy filing in 1992 has caused their property values to tumble 
by up to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every person is being hurt, even the people who just want to get it over 
with," said Holden, who said he splits his time between the condo and his legal 
residence in Southwest Los Angeles. He said he bought the condo after anonymous 
death threats in the wake of the Rodney G. King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership behind the Marina del Rey development filed for Chapter 11 
protection after defaulting on a $24-million loan from Aetna. Homeowners, the 
partnership and Aetna have been working on a reorganization plan ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, a committee composed of two homeowners and two representatives 
of the partnership will share management of the 600-unit complex, which had 
been managed exclusively by the partnership. JOHN BUZBEE

 ALHAMBRA: An unidentified man, an apparent suicide, was found hanging from a 
tree Monday morning. The man, described by police as between 25 and 50 years 
old, had tied his shoelaces to a tree near a concrete storm channel near New 
and Adams avenues. He was discovered at 7 a.m. but had apparently been there 
for a couple of days, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA: A bank was robbed Aug. 4 by a man who handed a teller a note 
demanding that she empty her cash drawer. Home Savings Bank at 60 E. Huntington 
Drive was robbed about 1:30 p.m., police said. The thief escaped with $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
 AZUSA: A 36-year-old Covina man, identified by authorities as a gang member, 
was shot and killed outside an apartment building Aug. 4. Ricky Torres Delgado 
died at 212 S. Azusa Ave. shortly after the 11:30 p.m. incident, Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies said. He had been shot numerous times. The occupants 
of a red 1989 Jeep Wrangler parked outside the building began shooting at 
Delgado, deputies said. The assailants then fled the scene but were spotted a 
short time later by Monrovia Police, who recognized the vehicle as one reported 
stolen. After a brief chase by car and on foot, police arrested Anton Delano 
Irvin, 19, of Baldwin Park, on suspicion of murder. He is being held in L.A. 
County Jail in lieu of $1 million bail. A passenger in the Wrangler remains at 
large. 
</P>
<P>
 BALDWIN PARK: A butcher shop was robbed Saturday by two men with handguns who 
ordered employees into a freezer. The store in the 3200 block of Baldwin Park 
Boulevard was robbed at 4:50 p.m., police said. The gunmen entered the store, 
ordered sodas and then pointed weapons at the three employees, forcing them to 
empty the cash register. The employees were then told to get in the walk-in 
freezer, police said. No one was hurt, and the robbers escaped with an 
undisclosed amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 BALDWIN PARK: A 64-year-old Baldwin Park woman allegedly shot her 61-year-old 
husband in the arm after a fight Aug. 4. Rita Yates was arrested on suspicion 
of attempted murder after allegedly shooting her husband, Jack Struble, in the 
right arm with a .38-caliber revolver. The shooting took place in the couple's 
home in the 14400 block of Cavette Place about 7 p.m., police said. Struble was 
listed in stable condition at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 COVINA: A 36-year-old Covina man was struck and killed by an alleged drunken 
driver Sunday night as he crossed the street at Citrus Avenue and Benbow 
Street. Mark David Ulrich was struck at 10 p.m. as he walked across Citrus 
Avenue. He died at the scene. A 1991 Toyota Camry traveling north on Benbow 
Street hit Ulrich, knocking him up over the hood and into the windshield, 
police said. The driver of the Toyota, Ralph Rios, 39, was arrested on 
suspicion of manslaughter and felony drunken driving. He is being held at the

 DIAMOND BAR: Two 13-year-old boys were arrested Sunday on suspicion of 
unlawfully setting a fire, sheriff's deputies said. The boys, whose names were 
not released because of their age, were booked at the Walnut Sheriff's station 
and were released to their parents. Sheriff's deputies believe the boys may be 
responsible for a three-acre brush fire that started about 7:20 p.m. Sunday in 
the 1800 block of South Diamond Bar Boulevard.

 POMONA: A 39-year-old Chino woman and a year-old Chino girl were killed Friday 
when their car veered into oncoming traffic. Catalina Chavez and Rayleen Orozco 
died in the 1:15 p.m. accident, police said. Chavez was driving south on 
Reservoir Street when her car veered into the northbound lane and slammed into 
a car driven by Arias Villagran, 30, of Ontario. Chavez and Orozco, who was in 
a child safety seat in the back of the car, were taken to Pomona Valley Medical 
Center, where they died a short time later. Villagran complained of leg pain, 
but declined medical treatment. His passenger, Teresa Tolentino, was taken to 
Pomona Valley Medical Center and treated for a broken leg. No arrests were 
made.

COMMUNITY NEWS: ROLLING HILLS ESTATES; CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO SELL SITE TO 
THEATER

 After more than a year of talks, the City Council voted Tuesday to sell a 
vacant post office building to the local Norris Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater will use the city-owned site rent-free and has the opportunity to 
buy it for $500,000 during the next 3 1/2 years.It can wait up to five years to 
purchase the property, but by then the price will rise to $600,000, under terms 
of the agreement the city approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The city-owned metal-sided building lies on 1.3 acres at Indian Peak Road, 
near the Peninsula Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 for the agreement, with Councilwoman Jacki McGuire, 
who opposes selling any city property, dissenting. The city has not been able 
to snag a commercial tenant for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit theater is across the street from the post office, and theater 
officials want to operate the building as an additional 99-seat theater and use 
it for office space. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Moe, co-chairman of the theater management board, said he hopes to 
raise $1 million to renovate the post office building. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater board must still approve the agreement, and a vote is expected 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The main sticking point between Norris officials and the city was the value of 
the post office site. An appraisal commissioned by the city came in at 
$745,000, while one commissioned by Norris came in at $271,000, said Judy 
Smith, Rolling Hills Estates finance director. JEFF KASS

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; IN THE GREEN; THE GROWING HEALTH FOOD FIELD IS PROVING 
LUCRATIVE FOR SOME COMPANIES, BUT THEIR CLAIMS ARE BEING QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At Sunrider International in Torrance, founder Tei Fu Chen talks of a world 
where people adhere to the "Philosophy of Regeneration," living on a diet of 
herbal foods that cleanse each of the body's systems. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the idea from centuries-old traditions he studied in Chinese texts. 
</P>
<P>
 At another Torrance company, Green Foods Corp. founder Yoshihide Hagiwara 
works on his late wife's cells, searching for a cure for cancer, the disease 
that killed her. His solution: antioxidants derived from green barley grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Their research may be exotic, but the natural methods they are using already 
have made them millions of dollars. The men run two of the South Bay's 
fastest-growing health food companies, capitalizing on a craze for natural 
foods ranging from grass-derived drinks to ginseng. 
</P>
<P>
 Their work has won praise from politicians, celebrities and athletes. Golfer 
Arnold Palmer drinks Green Foods' Green Magma, as does actress Jodie Foster. 
Last year, former Gov. George Deukmejian and then-Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert 
appeared at the grand opening of Sunrider's new headquarters and gave the 
company high marks for adding jobs in a dire economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the combination of health and wealth has also ignited a national debate 
over just how far health food companies can go in the claims they make about 
their products.  
</P>
<P>
 "Free enterprise is great, but none of us want to be ripped off," said Dan 
Walsh, food and drug fraud program specialist for the state Department of 
Health Services. "We want legitimate businesses that will build here for a 
while, that will be here in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 He points out actions filed by federal and state regulators in the late 1980s 
to restrict both Sunrider and Green Foods from boasting that their products 
could help relieve a host of ills. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh and several consumer groups oppose a bill pending before Congress that 
would prohibit the federal Food and Drug Administration from treating any 
dietary supplement as a drug or food additive, making it easier for 
manufacturers to make health claims. 
</P>
<P>
 But health food companies, their marketing departments and loyal customers say 
they are victims of a medical and government establishment that has failed to 
recognize the benefits of these products. They point to FDA efforts to restrict 
some herbal ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody should have freedom of choice to choose what kind of foods they 
want to eat instead of (being) regulated by the government agency," said Chen, 
the founder of Sunrider. "They try to control everything. They hope . . . if 
you want to eat rice, you have to get a prescription."  
</P>
<P>
 His company calls its approach "The Philosophy of Regeneration," nourishing 
the body's five major systems -- endocrine, digestive, respiratory, immune and 
circulatory -- with herbal formulas that include Chinese ginseng, dandelion 
root and licorice root. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen's goal is to use modern techniques to create herbal food products that 
are rooted in ancient traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than regulate the body (with medicines), we can nourish it, and let it 
regulate itself," said Chen, who came to the United States from Taiwan in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say Chen's emphasis on ancient traditions is just a marketing 
technique that gives the company's herbal foods and cosmetics a greater 
mystique than others on the market.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the health food movement, it really has religious overtones," 
said Mark Meskin, director of the nutrition program at USC School of Medicine. 
"A lot of the lingo is about detoxification and purification. They sound great, 
but we already have a detoxification system on board. That's what the liver 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chen says his network of 300,000 independent distributors "are not herb 
food nuts." They work in a multilevel marketing system like that established by 
Amway, and "are people devoted to wellness, to good health." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials say much of the skepticism comes from the clash of rigid 
Western ideas with Eastern traditions. They say that their marketing stops 
short of offering cures, but the company's products can benefit the body. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the FDA ought not to solely judge things on the Western approach to 
science," said Bob Henrie, Sunrider's marketing manager. "We do believe that 
herbs are good for the system. This a strong body of evidence based on 5,000 
years of science." 
</P>
<P>
 But the company came under fire in the late 1980s for its claims. According to 
a 1989 suit filed by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, the 
company said in its Sunwriter magazine that its Nutrien and other products had 
an effect on heart disease and pneumonia, and Sunrider salespeople said that 
the products had an effect on high blood pressure. In one case, the company 
listed Vitamin B-8 on its Nutrien food packages. No such vitamin exists, the 
suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney obtained a consent agreement forbidding Sunrider from 
making unsubstantiated claims that its products have any effect on diseases or 
medical conditions. Sunrider admitted no wrongdoing, but paid $175,000 in 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of the company's distributors did not immediately stop making 
claims about the products, according to Stephen Barrett, a retired psychiatrist 
and author of the upcoming book "The Vitamin Pushers." A Texas Sunrider 
distributor phoned him in 1990 and claimed that Sunrider products helped him 
and other family members who had arthritis, Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials, however, say distributors must sign forms agreeing not to 
make false claims about the products. "We focus on wellness, we focus on health 
and not disease," Henrie said. Making "claims doesn't succeed much. People 
won't purchase the product on a sustained basis if it doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunrider has also been sued over its products. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, U.S. judo champion James Martin filed suit against the company after 
he failed a drug test that disqualified him for the 1988 Olympic team. Martin 
said the Olympic Drug Testing Center found ephedrine, a stimulant banned by the 
Olympic committee, in Sunrider Action Caps, an energy product he had taken. 
Sunrider did not admit any wrongdoing, but settled the lawsuit for an 
undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
 In another lawsuit, Phoenix resident Debi Boling claimed that she purchased an 
herbal weight-loss medicine from Sunrider that contained rat poison and lead. 
According to court records, she lost her hair and suffered gastrointestinal 
problems. A federal District Court jury in Phoenix agreed and awarded her 
$650,000 in damages after a 1992 trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The company says that it has found a new piece of evidence: Boling's 
ex-husband Ken Andrews told a private investigator that he tainted the food in 
a scheme to defraud the company. But a U.S. District Court judge refused to 
overturn the judgment, saying the evidence was not sworn testimony. Sunrider is 
appealing his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Publicity over the trial proved troublesome for Chen. 
</P>
<P>
 Company sales literature included in court files claimed that Chen was the 
owner of manuscripts that contained Chinese herbal-medicine secrets dating back 
5,000 years. It said Chen's great-grandfather, a guard at the Emperor's Palace 
in Beijing, obtained the texts during the Boxer Rebellion and passed them down 
through the Chen family. 
</P>
<P>
 In an affidavit, however, Chen's father said he had no knowledge of his son's 
story about the documents. He also refuted some of the claims made in the 
company's sales literature about the younger Chen. Among them: that he was a 
sickly, impoverished child until the herbal formulas transformed him into the 
two-time kung fu champion of Taiwan and, later, a Chinese medical doctor. The 
father said Chen was a healthy child and was not trained as a doctor.  
</P>
<P>
 In a deposition, the younger Chen said that he could not recall where his kung 
fu medals were, and could not specifically name where the championships were 
won. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has said that Chen is not a doctor in the Western sense, but 
it "is the Chinese custom and tradition that a person with (Chen's) experience, 
education and traditional training to be referred to as doctor." Chen has an 
honorary doctorate degree from the Chinese Culture University in Taiwan.  
</P>
<P>
 The story about the manuscripts, Chen said in a deposition, was a "legend." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chen insists that he does have texts, which are 100 to 300 years old and 
include information gathered over 5,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My attitude is to say, 'So what?' " Henrie added. "People are not joining 
Sunrider based on what transcripts he has in his possession. . . . The issues 
raised, in my mind, are diversionary issues. There are some that compete in 
this business by attempting to discredit others." 
</P>
<P>
 Chen says one such company is E. Excel International Inc., a Utah health food 
company and competitor that is run by his sister, Jau Fe. The company in 1992 
mailed letters to Sunrider's distributors, informing them of the judgment in 
the Arizona case. 
</P>
<P>
 The motive, Chen said, was to "be a success without starting from the 
beginning. What is the easiest way? The best way is to knock me down." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, publicity about the cases hardly cut into the company's sales. 
Revenue has steadily climbed in the past five years, to $350 million in 1993, 
Chen said. It now employs 150 people in Torrance and 500 at its manufacturing 
operations in the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has its world headquarters, a futuristic, green glass 
building featuring indoor streams and herbal gardens, a movie theater and 
museum of Chinese artifacts.  
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics have also criticized Green Foods, which makes the barley products. 
But that company's sales have climbed ever since its Green Magma powdered drink 
was first introduced in the United States 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On a visit to Green Foods headquarters in a Torrance industrial park, founder 
Hagiwara, 68, holds up a Japanese tabloid that displays his photo. It trumpets 
his resolve to live to be 129 by eating natural foods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about every food you eat, you can't help but get a pollutant chemical in 
your body," said Hagiwara, who runs the company from Osaka, Japan. "You need 
something to remove the toxics." 
</P>
<P>
 Green Foods' U.S. sales in 1993 were $50 million, primarily through 
distribution in health food stores as Green Magma and through multilevel 
marketers as Barley Green. And customers swear by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live for my Green Magma," said Janice L. Green, 35, a Lomita photographer 
who takes it six times a day and says it cleans toxins from her body. "When I 
don't have it and go running, I'm dragging the rest of the day."  
</P>
<P>
 The company promotes the non-chemical means of making its products, harvested 
and processed at an Oxnard plant that employs about 50 people. Instead of 
pesticides, it uses ladybugs that eat smaller pests. Five acres of the grass 
are harvested a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on the Oxnard factory floor, Takahiko Amano, who runs the company's 
U.S. operations, explained how the juice drink is created. The barley is grown 
nearby on 120 acres of fields the company owns or leases. Then, specialized 
equipment crushes the grass, extracts juice and dehydrates it.  
</P>
<P>
 The story of how Hagiwara stumbled on barley as a dietary supplement dates 
back to the 1950s, when he became wealthy from a product he created to treat 
athlete's foot. The formula contained mercury, a toxic ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagiwara said that he and others were unaware of the heavy metal's harmful 
effects until his hair turned prematurely gray, he lost his teeth and skin came 
off his hands. The Japanese government banned the ingredient in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience made him wary of synthetically produced medicines. So he set 
out to find a natural substance that could make the body healthier. Observing 
that cows yielded more milk when they ate certain greens, he went on a mission 
to see which plants could have similar energizing benefits for humans. 
</P>
<P>
 At a kitchen laboratory at his home in Osaka, he sampled hundreds of greens -- 
from bamboo leaves to chickweed -- before he settled on the leaves of barley. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaves, he says, contain enzymes, vitamins and proteins. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the possible nutrients," Hagiwara said, "you name it, it's in there." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, he started marketing the product in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was very strong rejection from the medical and drug industry," he said. 
"They were saying, 'These are the things that the cows and the horses live on. 
That's not something that the humans should eat.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nutritionists in the United States echoed the criticisms when the product was 
introduced here in 1980. Many questioned whether Green Magma -- which sells for 
about $26 per box -- is any better than any other form of greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Foods promotes the product's concentration of chlorophyll, the green 
pigment in plants. In a press release, the company says that it stimulates the 
healing and regeneration of tissue and is a natural detoxifier. (Sunrider also 
markets a chlorophyll product, Evergreen, that it says helps eliminate body 
odor and bad breath.) Chlorophyll, however, has no role in human nutrition, 
argues William Jarvis, president of the National Council Against Health Fraud 
and a professor at Loma Linda University. Its benefits, if any, would be lost 
in digestion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's kind of a laugh," Jarvis said of Green Foods' claims. "People 
sell things so enthusiastically, they don't know when to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Green Magma "is a fairly harmless mess," said USC's Meskin. But he fears that 
people who use the product will stop conventional treatment for diseases. "That 
is when it is a dangerous problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned Green Foods to stop 
marketing their product as a way to eliminate a host of ailments, including 
diabetes, acne, asthma and high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The critics have not deterred Hagiwara from searching for a cure for cancer 
through his Hagiwara Institute of Health in Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
 He was researching treatments for cancer in 1981 when his wife was diagnosed 
with uterine cancer. But he was far from getting regulatory approval to use his 
cancer antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was desperate," he said. "But to go through regular channels, it takes 10 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 So he tested the antibodies on himself first, and then on his son. Then he 
injected the antibodies into his wife, he said, in the presence of her doctors. 
But it was too late. She died in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "The X-ray showed that the cancer stopped spreading in the lung," he said. 
"There was some effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he and his son, Hideaki, have obtained a research contract with UC 
Davis in which they use his wife's cells. Among their findings: that green 
barley inhibits "lipid oxidation," the oxidizing process in all living matter 
that hastens the destruction of the immune system. Researchers at UC Davis are 
also studying the antioxidants in other foods, including brewed coffee and even 
cooked beefsteak. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Council Against Health Fraud's Jarvis says that the research on 
antioxidants is far from conclusive.  
</P>
<P>
 "Antioxidants are enjoying their own mythology," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Hagiwara vows to continue his research and to convince doubters 
with more studies. He predicts that today's naysayers will come to accept Green 
Magma, even use it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single household will have this," he said at a conference table where 
several of his employees had glasses of the green liquid, which smells like 
newly mowed grass and tastes like tea. "Just like every household has Coca-Cola 
as a drink, we are going to market it as an ideal fast food." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunrider's Chen sees a global future for his company's products, including 
untapped markets in China and Russia and in countries of South America. But 
he's also not missing out on a product common to the back yards of Southern 
California. Just introduced: "Dr. Chen's Secret Sauce" for barbecuing.

 Despite a two-hitter by Brandon Marks, West Torrance was eliminated from the 
Babe Ruth Pacific Southwest Regional baseball tournament on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 West Torrance, the Southern California champion, managed only two hits and was 
hurt by three errors in a 3-2 loss to Paradise Valley, Ariz., in a losers' 
bracket game at Taylorsville, Utah. Catcher Tony Cosentino had both hits. 
</P>
<P>
 West Torrance finished the double-elimination tournament with a 2-2 record. In 
other games, the team beat Reno West, Nev., 9-2, and the Republic of Guam, 
14-4, and lost to Alameda, Calif, 3-2, in eight innings.

 The El Segundo American Legion baseball team lost twice to Chino last week and 
was eliminated from the Southern California tournament at Upland. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of El Segundo's two losses ended in controversy. With the score 
tied, 5-5, and one out in the top of the 10th inning, a Chino batter hit a 
sinking liner at shortstop Morgan Ensberg with runners on first and third. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensberg thought he caught the ball on the fly, but the umpire ruled it had hit 
the ground first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ensberg was getting ready to throw to first to double up the runner, but he 
had to regroup and go to second," Coach John Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo nearly turned a double play, but the batter was ruled safe in a 
close play at first, allowing the runner from third to score the winning run in 
a 6-5 Chino victory Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo came back to defeat Arcadia, 7-5, in 10 innings Friday behind the 
pitching of David Reed and an eighth-inning home run by Steve Rawson that tied 
the score, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
 That set up Saturday's rematch with Chino, which rallied for two runs in the 
eighth to break a 3-3 tie and went on to win, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo finished the season with a 27-11 record.

CITY LACKS INSURANCE FOR JURY AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Pasadena officials say the city has no insurance policy to cover a 
jury's award of $1.2 million to former Mayor Lee Prentiss and will be forced to 
use reserves and cut services unless the huge verdict is overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pasadena Superior Court jury two weeks ago decided that city officials 
violated Prentiss' civil rights in 1990 by conspiring -- for political reasons 
-- to revoke a building permit to expand his 86-year-old home. It awarded him 
$1.06 million for actual damages and $150,000 for emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena is self-insured through an organization formed by Southern 
California cities known as the Joint Powers Independent Authority. To the 
surprise of city officials, the authority denied South Pasadena's claim to 
cover part of the jury award, saying it does not pay out on civil rights 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the verdict stands, the citizens are going to pay with some major cutbacks 
in city services," said Chuck Conn, assistant city manager who is running the 
municipality while City Manager Ken Farfsing is on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be forced to cut the softer items such as library, the recreation 
programs and the senior center and, of course, personnel," said Conn, who added 
that his job may be among the first to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would pay the award with a large chunk of its $2.7 million in 
reserves that cover emergencies and purchases of new equipment such as police 
cars and firetrucks. Conn said that money would then have to be replaced 
through cuts in services and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's general fund budget is $10.6 million this fiscal year. Mayor Amedee 
O. Richards said no decision has been made on whether to appeal the verdict or 
seek a retrial, since Judge J. Michael Byrne is still reviewing the jury's July 
29 decision and could cut the award. 
</P>
<P>
 But a challenge is likely if the award remains high. In April, residents 
approved a special tax to generate $234,000 annually to keep the library open. 
But that amount could be smaller than Prentiss' attorney fees which the city 
will now have to pay in addition to the award, said city officials. The city 
itself has spent more than $300,000 fighting the case. 
</P>
<P>
 At last Wednesday's council meeting, many residents urged the council to drop 
the matter. "You have been . . . told that you're wrong," said resident Mary 
Wirth. "I am shocked and amazed that the city is so pigheaded." 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers said the case should have been settled out of court before the award. 
On Sunday, a group of residents calling for a recall of the council will hold a 
meeting in Garfield Park.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MONTEREY PARK; CITY WORKERS PICKET FOR CONTRACT, 1% RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City employees picketed in front of Monterey Park City Hall on Tuesday to 
demand a contract and a 1% pay raise retroactive to July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers, who include all blue-collar, clerical and police department 
civilians, are represented by Service Employees International Union, Local 347, 
and have been working without a contract for two years, according to union 
negotiator Julie Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher said the two parties are less than $100,000 apart on negotiations. But 
she said that a settlement has been stalled by city officials for various 
reasons, including passage of the state budget and municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials could not be reached for comment.

SPORTS; NOTEBOOK / KIRBY LEE; CENTER JONES TO TRANSFER TO CHAFFEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Avondre Jones, a 6-foot-11 center who was released in June from his basketball 
scholarship at USC, is transferring to Chaffey, a community college in Rancho 
Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who averaged 3.8 points and 3.1 rebounds as a freshman at USC, will be 
eligible to play this season, a deciding factor in his choice. Jones had 
considered Missouri, Michigan, Iowa and Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going to a JC will be an advantage in the long run," Jones said. "I can play 
right away and focus on playing and lifting weights and doing all those things. 
After that, I can go anywhere and play." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was recruited by nearly 100 colleges in 1993 after averaging 21.2 points 
and 11.7 rebounds as a senior at Artesia High. He played only 13 minutes a game 
as a freshman at USC and asked for a release from his scholarship, which was 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even count last year as a season. I need to play to sharpen my 
skills," Jones said. "It's not going to help me to sit out another season." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who played in the Say No Classic summer league at Trade Tech, helped 
his team Big Time to a league-best 7-1 record and berth in the tournament 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Ed and Charles O'Bannon, brothers formerly of Artesia, played for 
league runner-up Team Pasadena ATFB, which lost to Blue Chip, 96-93, in the 
tournament final. Ed O'Bannon scored 31 points against Blue Chip, which 
featured Bruin Cameron Dollar and incoming UCLA freshmen Toby Bailey and J.R. 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Wilkerson of Long Beach State was selected as the women's most valuable 
player of the Say No Classic league. Kim Barfield, Melissa Gower and Marshella 
Hariston of Long Beach were also selected to the all-tournament team.

next to the Queen Mary in Long Beach harbor.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; MAN GIVEN 5-YEAR TERM FOR BUS PASS FORGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The son of the former owners of Lamb Funeral Home in Pasadena has been 
sentenced to five years in an Arizona state prison on criminal charges of 
forging bus passes. 
</P>
<P>
 David Sconce, who has pending criminal actions against him in California, 
pleaded guilty to the Arizona charges June 29, and was sentenced July 28 in 
Kingman, Ariz.Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Harvey Giss said California 
authorities will begin extradition proceedings in a few months to have Sconce 
brought back to California for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Sconce and his parents, Laurieanne and Jerry Sconce, were accused in 1987 of 
stealing gold from hundreds of bodies, removing and selling organs from 
cadavers without permission, and performing multiple cremations in Altadena and 
Hesperia. David Sconce pleaded guilty in 1989 to 21 criminal charges and served 
more than two years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But other charges remained, including conspiracy to kill a possible rival 
mortuary owner. Before the trial could begin in California, Sconce was arrested 
in April in Arizona and charged with selling phony bus passes. He had been free 
on bail and living in Bullhead City where he worked as a bus driver for 1 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sconce disappeared for 19 days after the Arizona charges were filed against 
him in April, but he later turned himself in and entered a guilty plea.

SPORTS; RIDING ANOTHER WAVE OF SUCCESS; JUNIOR OLYMPIC WATER POLO TOURNAMENT 
REACHES HIGH-WATER MARK IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stan Sprague knew there was potential for growth in the mid-1980s when the 
Amateur Athletic Federation granted a request by U.S. Water Polo to take on 
responsibility for organizing and managing a Junior Olympic tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the switch, water polo had struggled to stay afloat amid more popular 
sports such as track and field, basketball and swimming, all of which had more 
participants and influence over the location of Junior Olympic competition 
sites and schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Junior Olympic water polo is flourishing. Nowhere is that more evident 
than Long Beach, site of this year's national tournament, which began Saturday 
and continues through this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprague is in his ninth year as chairman of the event that has become the 
largest water polo tournament in the nation. This year, 151 teams are competing 
in three boys and three girls divisions -- 13-and-under, 15-and-under and 
17-and-under. More than 1,500 players from teams in California, Texas, Florida, 
Illinois, Missouri, Washington and Maryland began play last week at seven 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Semifinal matches will be played today and Friday at Long Beach Wilson High, 
Los Alamitos High and two pools at Long Beach State. Championship matches in 
all divisions will be played Saturday at Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, whenever we have had the tournament in Southern or Northern 
California, we have always had the largest number of participants," said 
Sprague, 53, a Long Beach State graduate who is the goalie coach for the U.S. 
National team. "This area is simply a hotbed for the sport. That's evident to 
anyone who comes out and watches these kids play." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Wilson is among the teams that are considered contenders for 
championships in this year's boys tournament, which drew 105 teams. Others 
include teams based in the Tustin-Anaheim area, Stanford, San Clemente, Corona 
del Mar, North Hollywood, Clovis, St. Louis and Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 City of Commerce, Modesto-Stanislaus and Annapolis are considered the 
strongest girls programs in a 46-team field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that only the top three teams from each region qualified, but 
the tournament has been opened to anyone who wants to participate," said Tony 
Martinho, the boys varsity coach at Los Alamitos High who is serving as the 
tournament's local facilities coordinator. "That has allowed more kids to 
develop and get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Developing players for national-level teams was only one of the goals when 
U.S. Water Polo took over the Junior Olympic tournament from the AAU. The 
primary purpose for the switch was to create a well-organized event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were getting a little frustrated because we weren't getting the numbers of 
teams participating that we thought we should be getting and we weren't getting 
adequate facilities or desk help," Sprague said. "Water polo was taking a 
second seat to other sports." 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. Martinho said about 150 local volunteers are helping to stage 
this year's event, in which every team is guaranteed at least five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Those kind of developmental opportunities have become increasingly common for 
high school-age water polo players. After their regular high school seasons, 
which might include 25 or 26 matches, players participate in as many as 55 
matches during summer leagues and tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Junior Olympics allows national team coaches to observe potential 
international-level players of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of like to watch the 17-and-unders play because those are the kids we 
might want to get involved in our national junior team program, which is our 
progression into the national team," Sprague said. "When the tournament is here 
in California, it's much easier for the coaching staff because we can see all 
the kids from outside the state in one place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice for us because we're seeing kids in a competitive environment," 
Sprague said. "They don't know they are being evaluated because it's done in a 
very low-key fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Sprague expects that the National Junior Olympics for water polo will continue 
to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only going to get bigger and better," he said. "And when I say bigger, 
that doesn't necessarily mean more teams. We need to keep the numbers up big 
and the level of competition high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're on the right track."

REVENUE: LETTING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY KNOCK IN LA MIRADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to commend La Mirada City Councilmen Wayne Rew and Pete Dames for their 
logical support of having a Big 5 Sporting Goods store go in at the corner of 
La Mirada Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue. It's too bad they were outvoted 3-2 
on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 If an upscale restaurant isn't interested in building there (and three years 
is a more than adequate time gauge), then it behooves the council to welcome 
with open arms a big company that is willing to locate to our great city. The 
council is on record as adoring taxation, which is used to pay for its beloved 
La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts. Then it turns around and snubs the 
sales tax dollars that would be generated by Big 5, an amount estimated by city 
officials to be $20,000 to $50,000 a year. That could easily pay for all the 
yearly junkets the council members take to such places as Orlando, (Fla.), 
Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, wouldn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 I must chastise Councilmen C. David Peters, Bob Chotiner and Hal Malkin for 
their tunnel vision in rejecting Big 5 Sporting Goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially irksome is Malkin's anti-business posture here, since he is a 
businessman in this community. It is obvious that his judgment is blurred by 
his affection and connection to the La Mirada theater and his desire to have a 
restaurant adjacent to the theater. He'd rather have an empty lot than 
guaranteed sales-tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to raise one rhetorical question: Are we really better served 
when politicians and bureaucrats determine who can do business and who can't?

BRIEFLY; EDUCATION: NEW GRADUATION POLICY APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students must finish all classes and proficiency tests before they will be 
allowed to participate in graduation ceremonies, the board of the Centinela 
Valley Union High School District has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new policy, exceptions would be granted only after a student files a 
formal petition and goes before the board for review, said Supt.Joseph M. 
Carrillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the policy change, graduating seniors at the district's two high 
schools -- Leuzinger and Hawthorne -- who were up to 10 units short of the 
district's required 215 units were allowed to participate with the condition 
they would make up the units in summer school, Carrillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials say too many students failed to make up the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools gave students the option because it was important to parents for 
their children to go through graduation ceremonies with their class, said Amy 
E. Fujihara, associate principal at Hawthorne High. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the district's 1,000 graduates each year, about 200 are conditional 
graduates. About 30% of those conditional graduates never come back to finish 
their course work or proficiency tests, Carrillo said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they hope the new policy will help motivate students to get 
their work done on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting to notify students due to graduate in 1995 to find out who 
needs to get in to the after-school programs" to make up failed or missing 
credits and tests, said Trina Dellagatta, an associate principal at Leuzinger 
High.  
</P>
<P>
 At Hawthorne, Fujihara, who has been with the district more than 30 years, 
said she began warning students last year when she suspected a change was 
coming. JON GARCIA

CITY HALL NEWS: PALOS VERDES ESTATES: RESIDENT PUTS RELUCTANT CITY COUNCIL ON 
TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Palos Verdes Estates City Council does not want to be on TV. But it is 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Dimension Cable Service gave Palos Verdes Estates the option 
of broadcasting its City Council meetings live on Channel 3, which is reserved 
for government-sponsored shows. The city declined. 
</P>
<P>
 But three months ago, Palos Verdes Estates resident John Dowsing began 
appearing at City Council meetings with his 8-millimeter video camera. He says 
he wants to expose the council to public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Dowsing tapes a City Council meeting, copies it onto a VHS cassette and gives 
the cassette to Dimension, which broadcasts the tape twice on Channel 33, as it 
does all public access shows, said Steve Fowler, Dimension's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials stand by their decision not to broadcast council meetings, but 
Dowsing says he is there to stay.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the council pays $350 a month to broadcast announcements of 
community events and council agendas on Channel 3. But officials say that 
televising meetings attracts residents and elected officials, who play to the 
cameras rather than the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "What most city councils have is one or two loudmouths who love to see 
themselves speak," says City Manager James Hendrickson, "and the rest of the 
council gets ticked because it frustrates the process of governing." 
</P>
<P>
 Dowsing, however, questions some of the city's financial decisions, such as 
buying composting boxes, and adds that the city may be trying to avoid scrutiny 
by not televising meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just like the public to see what's going on with the city," Dowsing 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dowsing, 50, now a fixture at City Hall every other Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., says 
he is happy to tape the meetings: Airing tapes on Channel 33 is free, and the 
only costs are the time spent and $15 every couple of weeks for a VHS cassette. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice if the city filmed themselves," Dowsing says, "but if they 
don't, I'll do it." JEFF KASS

BUDGET: GETTING THE MOST FROM CITY'S FISCAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most important task in the annual cycle of government work is the creation 
of the next year's budget. A budget is more than just numbers, projected 
revenues and expenditures. It represents the hopes and dreams of a community, 
the opportunities, protections and quality of life of its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past decade, Long Beach's city manager and City Council have presided 
over a steep decline in opportunity and quality of life without having made any 
philosophical or structural changes.  
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the choices put to citizens have been higher taxes, less services, or 
as in this year's budget, a combination of both. It is a choice from among 
negatives, and is therefore unacceptable as a matter of ongoing public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we do better? You bet. Progressive cities across the country have had 
successful experience with introducing business techniques to the public 
sector. The idea is not, as Ross Perot said, to "run government like a 
business," but rather to make government more entrepreneurial. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only can the city's budget process benefit from new private-sector 
thinking, but we taxpayers would get a far bigger public service bang for every 
budgeted buck. A budget is nothing if not informative and a planning tool. 
</P>
<P>
 To be informative, a separate report should be generated to reveal not only 
how many dollars were spent, but whether the money was well spent. Costs should 
be broken down per capita, or based on an activity base, and then compared with 
data of other cities with similar populations. 
</P>
<P>
 The main purpose of a budget is to be used as a planning tool. Multiyear 
spreading of anticipated revenues and expenses is therefore essential. Council 
members would suddenly find that they have something in their laps that is 
readable and on which intelligent decisions can be based, instead of the 
current document, which might as well be written in Latin. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, city department heads would welcome performance-based feedback 
too. After all, if you don't measure results, how can you tell success from 
failure?

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students who live too far from a state university to attend part-time programs 
or those who just want to study from home may now earn a master's degree in 
business from their living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Dominguez Hills will start a program this fall that allows students 
to watch TV broadcasts of all 15 classes required for a master's degree in 
business administration.KLCS Channel 58 will air the programs. The classes will 
be offered from 9 a.m. to noon every Saturday and Sunday starting Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes will be taught at the Carson campus, and some students will attend the 
weekend lectures.  
</P>
<P>
 Students watching from home will be able to call in to the class by telephone 
and interact with instructors, and submit course work by modem. The first two 
classes will be "Business Economics" and "Finance and Business Management and 
Marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 Every seven weeks, students will gather at the Dominguez Hills campus to meet 
with instructors and other students. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for the program is $199 per unit. School officials estimate it will 
take most students 2 1/2 years to complete the 45-unit degree. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is open to students who earned a bachelor's degree with a 
grade-point average of at least 2.75 in their last 60 units. Students also must 
score 450 or higher on the Graduate Management Admission Test. Information:

BRIEFLY; CHILD CARE: YMCA OPENS CORPORATE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The YMCA opened its first corporate child care facility in the South Bay this 
month at the TRW Data Technology Division in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gardena/Carson YMCA will operate the preschool for children ages 2 to 5 
whose parents work at TRW. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has about 2,000 square feet of space, including an outdoor play 
area and two classrooms. Currently 16 children attend, but the school can 
accommodate up to 50. It is open from 6:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 TRW provided the facility on its property and the YMCA operates it on a 
contract. Tuition of $80 a week, paid by the families, covers the costs of 
operation, YMCA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA will probably participate in more corporate child care centers 
because other companies in the South Bay have expressed interest in having 
quality child care available to their employees, said YMCA spokesman George 
Saikali. MARY GUTHRIE

CITY HALL NEWS: AVALON: PUBLIC HEARING WILL FOCUS ON PROPOSAL FOR $100-MILLION 
RESORT 
</P>

<P>
 A $100-million resort has been proposed for Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Catalina G.B.C. Ltd. Partnership, a development partnership formed by The 
Pointe Group in Arizona, has leased several acres of land from the Santa 
Catalina Island Co. to build a 300-suite hotel, City Manager Robert F. Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it gets City Council approval, the hotel will be erected on Descanso Beach, 
between the Casino building and Hamilton Cove, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 The development would contribute hotel and property taxes to the island 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will allow the city to provide more services to the community. We're 
talking millions of dollars a year," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hoped the hotel will attract visitors in the off-tourist season, 
especially people who can use the casino building for conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said the developer also plans to lease the Catalina Island Golf Club and 
expand it to 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will hold a public meeting on the development plan Tuesday in 
Avalon's Los Angeles County Courthouse at 7 p.m. SUSAN WOODWARD

ALONG FOR THE PRIDE; THE O.C. GAY AND LESBIAN FESTIVAL CELEBRATES FUN THE 
OLD-FASHIONED WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free child care and a variety of support groups for parents are offered. 
Church ads fill the program, and presentations include "Proactive Religion." 
The police pass out recruitment literature, and it takes place in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one festival that prides itself on family values. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working hard to fulfill the need for child care so our gay and lesbian 
parents can enjoy the festival knowing their child is within reach," said Tom 
Heilman, president of "Stonewall 25: A Global Celebration." The Orange County 
Gay and Lesbian Pride event is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday on and around 
the UC Irvine campus; the theme is shared by all Gay and Lesbian Pride 
celebrations across the nation this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Live entertainment, business and service organization booths, a coffeehouse, 
arcade, food court and art expo will be in Aldrich Park. A parade led by Grand 
Marshal Amanda Bearse -- she's Marcy d'Arcy on "Married With Children" -- will 
begin at noon on Sunday on the campus perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 John Breitweiser will be named O.C. Cultural Pride's Man of the Year at an 
awards presentation Sunday afternoon at the coffeehouse; Julie Tanit is Woman 
of the Year, and KFI Radio talk show host Tammy Bruce will receive the media 
achievement award. 
</P>
<P>
 Breitweiser will also speak at a "gay issues awareness tutorial" on Saturday 
and display his paintings at the art expo. Several of his paintings, including 
"Traditional Family Values?," will be made into T-shirts for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 He described one of his more recent works: 
</P>
<P>
 "A baby's highchair is pushed against a wall," Breitweiser said. "Different 
size plates and lunch pails are arrayed in a fan shape on the wall. All have 
epithets about us on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the greatest dangers of homophobic ideas is to kids, to how they view 
themselves. (Epithets) affect kids in horribly destructive ways and (cause) 
self-destructive behaviors. Aberrant lifestyle, sodomite, repugnant, fairy . . 
. people think these epithets belong to us, and as youngsters, we're force-fed 
these ideas. We're raised on a diet of self-hate." 
</P>
<P>
 Other featured speakers include John Good of the Catholic Church of Orange 
Outreach and Jerry Lail, an active member of the Irvine United Church of 
Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Lail will focus on how gays can constructively channel what they feel are the 
hurtful and "hateful" messages of the religious right. Said Lail, "Many in the 
gay and lesbian community have been robbed of a life-affirming spirituality . . 
. in the name of religion." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanit, best known for her leadership of the Eleanor Roosevelt Democratic Club 
and currently Special Projects Coordinator for the AIDS Services Foundation of 
Orange County, said she views the event as a celebration of diversity, 
especially the diversity within the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some like to disco, some like to two-step," Tanit said. "We have booths from 
business organizations and organizations run by gays and lesbians for gays and 
lesbians. There will be support groups for people dealing with coming-out 
issues, for parents dealing with their children's coming-out issues, and for 
parents dealing with their own coming-out issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanit will be found at the Democratic Club booth, or in the dunk tank -- "It 
helps when you have someone being dunked that many people know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration is in its sixth year -- this is the fifth at Aldrich Park -- 
and according to Breitweiser, it has evolved "in incredibly positive" ways. 
Increased attendance is only one of them: Fewer than 2,000 attended the first 
event at Santa Ana's Centennial Park; 15,000 are expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Breitweiser, "Most gay people get information about ourselves and our 
community from mainstream media such as The Times . . . . Most gay people don't 
read (the gay magazine) the Blade. Our visibility (in the mainstream media) is 
what has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The first celebration, he said, unfolded in "a very threatening environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had to be 50 anti-gay protesters saying that we deserved to die," 
Breitweiser recalled. "Although we still have those protesters, we're not 
intimidated the way we were that year, when it was a totally new experience. 
Our visibility has empowered us."

WANNA DANCE?: KOKOMO'S SKIN CONTEST SEEMS MODELED ON REEL LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After wasting an hour watching Fox's newest Wednesday night fluff series, 
"Models, Inc.," head to Kokomo's in Irvine for a dose of the real thing. It's 
less glamorous and twice as silly. It is, after all, real life. 
</P>
<P>
 In two short segments at the club's once-a-week installation of Hump Night, 
promoted by Unity Productions, a dozen young ladies try to be models or just 
look like one. They teeter in heels, first in sexy dresses and then in bikinis, 
motivated by the dream of winning the illustrious 1994 Venus Model Search. 
</P>
<P>
 What's that, you ask? 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers and the literature that comes in a shiny black folder say it's an 
"upscale, professionally run, international model search." Videos run 
continuously on monitors, showing last year's winners hamming it up in Venus 
swimsuits at a fashion shoot rivaled only by those shown on "Star Search." 
Their mugs end up on the pages of the official Venus swimsuit catalogue, 
allegedly coming to a mailbox near you. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, super models can find fame at a nightclub. Claudia Schiffer was 
discovered at a Dusseldorf hot spot. But she was just hanging out there -- and 
not in a bikini. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's doubtful that she or any of the other women gracing the pages of 
Vogue and Harper's had to put up with an MC in a tuxedo shirt with the sleeves 
cut off, spewing expletives to whip up the crowd. It's also safe to say 
designer Karl Lagerfeld never primed the audience at a Chanel show with: "Hey, 
would you like to see these girls butt naked?" 
</P>
<P>
 Upscale never looked or sounded so gutter level. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges are volunteers; three of the five are picked from the audience. The 
winning contestant gets $50 and a chance to compete in the venue finals Aug. 
24, before heading off to the national finals, an event which looked like a 
beauty pageant on the video. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, a gal can dream, can't she? 
</P>
<P>
 So can the guys hootin' and slobbering around the stage during the event. A 
few fall over each other trying to get a closer look. Others exchange 
high-fives. As amusing a display of testosterone good times as it is, it could 
make any woman there uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
 All that aside, this Unity-promoted night cranks with enough energy among the 
500 to 600 young patrons who attend to power all the lights in Irvine -- long 
before the skin contest even gets going. The hand stamps glowing under the 
black lights reveal that many of the fresh faces present are 18 to 20 years old 
(those 21 and over get a black stamp); the bulk of the crowd looks to be under 
24. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress is casual -- right down to the plastic thong sandals and bikini top and 
shorts ensembles permitted. Not allowed is anything that could be construed as 
gang-related: hats, flannel or plaid anything, hooded shirts, calf-length 
shorts, baggy clothes or sports logos. 
</P>
<P>
 Deejay Tommy T. keeps the dance floors (a long narrow space flanked by two 
smaller, elevated squares) jampacked throughout the night with dance music 
blocks that range from Naughty by Nature to Frankie Goes to Hollywood. The new 
wave generates a bit less excitement than the newer hip-hop, but doesn't lose 
enough to scare the deejay out of playing it. And this diverse crowd gets as 
crazed over Snoop Doggy Dog as it does over the Offspring, the O.C.-based punk 
band that MTV and KROQ can't get enough of. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who can't stand the sweaty main room anymore head to an enclosed patio. 
It's accessible by an entrance near the bar and faces the front entrance, 
making it a perfect lookout point for late-coming friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Until closing, the Grill (located to the left of the bar) serves fare fit for 
a teen belly and budget: appetizers such as fried mushrooms or zucchini ($3) 
and chicken strips, potato skins and wings ($4). Dinner is a deal at $3.50 for 
spaghetti and salad or a cheeseburger and fries. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, but they're not total junkies. They get a grip on bottled water ($1.50) 
more than sodas ($1.50). Legal drinkers indulge in the specials: domestic draft

Friday, $10 Saturday. This is unquestionably one of the more attractive 
nightclubs in the region. But as a club choice among the county's hot spots, 
it's a moldy one. Its designed slickness, combined with its even slicker crowd, 
makes an evening here like a return to the tawdry '80s: pumps, perms and pecs 
everywhere.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: VARIOUS ARTISTS "SONGS FROM CHIPPY" / HOLLYWOOD RECORDS  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Chippy," which premiered this year in Philadelphia, is a theatrical 
production based on the diaries of a prostitute who worked the Texas Panhandle 
in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Songs From Chippy" is one of the best albums of the year in country music, or 
any other genre. It brings together one of the most accomplished fraternities 
of singer-songwriters in the United States, the Austin, Texas, old-buddy 
network centered around Joe Ely and Butch Hancock. Other leading voices are 
Wayne Hancock (no relation to Butch), Terry Allen, who wrote the play with his 
wife, Jo Harvey Allen, and Jo Carol Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs, recorded at Ely's home studio, sketch some of the main characters 
from the play, notably its titular namesake, whose earthy humor is balanced by 
a fear of pay-back in the hereafter for her 6,000 paid liaisons. But it isn't 
so much character that drives the songwriting, as an attention to the mood of a 
certain place at a certain time: hard, bleak and dusty West Texas, during the 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Crusty singing voices abound, and they are utterly persuasive in creating the 
illusion that we are listening to people who moved across a landscape of 
barrooms and oil fields more than 50 years ago. All are excellent -- not for 
their vocal purity, but for their lived-in realism and expressiveness. Wayne 
Hancock is a special find on his two numbers. He truly has a voice out of time, 
a yodel that harks back to Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers in its ability to 
convey merriment without ever forgetting that life is a raw and chilly 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical settings are drawn from the '30s and '40s as well. Fiddles, 
barroom pianos and steel guitars color lively sawdust-coated honky-tonk tunes 
and Western swing. Ghostly folk strains emerge for some of the graver numbers, 
and Ely introduces a dire, ominous work-song beat on his oil-boom epic, "Cold 
Black Hammer." 
</P>
<P>
 Chippy emerges as an admirable figure, but this is no cliched, 
hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold tale. There's nothing quaint or cute about it. The 
songs are about people who scrape for their money and grasp for some human 
connection. They are unable to hold either for long, and they carry with them a 
sense that bleakness, sparseness and loneliness are the fated lot of the place 
they inhabit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the closing valediction, "Roll Around," delivered by Butch Hancock in his 
reedy, Dylanesque bard's voice, suggests that philosophical beauty can grow 
even amid barrenness and loss. Narrow and hard as life might have been for 
Chippy and her consorts, they have tried mightily to enjoy it, and the 
greatness of their yearnings has risen above the meanness of their 
circumstances.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: THE ROLLING STONES "BLACK AND BLUE" (1976) / VIRGIN  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When "Black and Blue" first hit the streets, even some die-hard Stones fans 
had a hard time warming up to it. Reflecting Mick Jagger and Keith Richards' 
growing fascination with reggae and urban street funk, it remains one of the 
band's most significant departures from its signature blues-rock sound, and it 
still requires a certain amount of patience and perseverance. But for those 
willing to put forth the effort, this is an underrated gem. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening track, "Hot Stuff," initially might sound mired in its own rhythm. 
Yet after repeated listenings, the insistent groove and Jagger's nasty 
vocalizing grow in strength and allure. A first reaction to "Melody" may be 
cautious: Who wants to hear the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band tackling an 
uptown jazz number? But the Stones infuse this finger-popping track with just 
the right doses of sass and sensuality. "Hey Negrita," with its Caribbean 
accents, is the blackest and bluest cut; Richards' chugging guitar riffs ignite 
its salacious mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black and Blue" served as a vehicle for the Stones to audition guitarists for 
the spot that recently had been vacated by Mick Taylor. Three of the candidates 
made it onto the album. Wayne Perkins, an American, was the most technically 
proficient; indeed, his nifty solo on the straight-ahead rocker "Hand of Fate" 
is one of the most memorable in the band's long and glorious history. The job, 
of course, wound up going to Ron Wood, whose first two recordings as a Stone 
also are included here. 
</P>
<P>
 Four or five songs from "Black and Blue" helped anchor the Stones' European 
tour in '76. They all but vanished on subsequent U.S. excursions, but the band 
has been playing two numbers from the album -- "Hot Stuff" and "Memory Motel," 
a lovely road ballad on which Jagger and Richards trade vocals -- on the early 
stages of its current "Voodoo Lounge" tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all the Rolling Stones' post-'60s studio albums, "Black and Blue" is 
available now in a remastered version from Virgin Records, the group's current 
label. A limited collector's edition offers a slightly larger jewel case and 
the original album packaging.

SPOTLIGHT; SAVED BY THE BELT; KICKING AROUND SELF-DEFENSE, DISCIPLINE? MARTIAL 
YOUR FORCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Zan Dubin is a staff writer for the Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Late one evening, a panhandler approached 4-foot-9 Kathy Murphy in a mini-mall 
as she was about to step into her VW and drive home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me for money," Murphy recalled, "and I told him I didn't have any 
money for him and to leave me alone." 
</P>
<P>
 All that did, however, was provoke the man -- twice Murphy's size -- who began 
to curse loudly, wave his arms wildly and come closer. 
</P>
<P>
 When walking away didn't stop him either, Murphy, who has four years of karate 
training under her black belt, made a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got a little too close for me," she said, "so I turned around, threw my 
stuff down on the ground and put my hands up" in a standard defensive stance. 
</P>
<P>
 That worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He backed off immediately," said Murphy, a 37-year-old Anaheim resident who 
describes her pre-karate self as a painfully shy couch potato who lacked the 
confidence to look people in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had I not had this training," she said emphatically, "that man would have had 
everything in my car and in my purse." Through karate, "I have become a 
different person." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, a metal company comptroller and part-time karate instructor who 
practices seven days a week while raising two kids, is one of a score of 
martial-arts devotees across Orange County who extol its virtues with 
vehemence. 
</P>
<P>
 Many such enthusiasts may show up at the Long Beach Convention Center on Aug. 
20 and 21 for Ed Parker's 31st Annual International Karate Championships (for 
information, call (714) 450-3166). It's the nation's biggest martial-arts 
competition of the year, said Murphy, who will vie for trophies along with at 
least 5,000 other contestants. 
</P>
<P>
 And, the number of new followers is likely to grow when "The Next Karate Kid" 
-- the film series' fourth installment -- opens next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time a marital-arts movie comes out, or there's a big news story, more 
calls come in" and enrollment jumps, says Tom Muzila, owner of a Los Angeles 
branch of Shotokan Karate of America, which has a school in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, be they proficient at karate, kung fu, jujitsu or any of the 
discipline's other myriad so-called systems (see accompanying box), 
martial-arts advocates rave about the benefits they reap beyond the ability to 
defend themselves in a pinch. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, their dedication demands sacrifice. Hard-core students can easily 
spend 20 hours or more each week at the dojo , the place of practice. Exercises 
can be exhausting and numbingly repetitive, and the ache of sore muscles can be 
compounded by bruises, or, when mishaps occur, black eyes or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all die-hard enthusiasts, however, these fans see the time, energy and 
money they spend doing what they love as a matter of getting, not giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Murphy, they talk about newfound self-confidence and self-respect that 
seems to swell from some inner source they never even knew they had. They rave 
about the physical and mental conditioning, the camaraderie and the stress 
reduction the pursuit affords. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women adherents attest to a greater sense of gender equality, in large 
part because mental acuity and technical mastery, not brute strength, are what 
it takes to take an opponent out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be a man's world," says the petite Murphy, who regularly wins 
tournaments against men who generally stand a foot taller and weigh at least 
twice as much. These days, she adds with a chuckle, hubby Michael -- who spent 
21 years in the Army -- relies on her to find out what goes bump in the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now he tells me to get up and find out what the noise is." 
</P>
<P>
 Most martial arts practiced today originated in China, Japan or Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the countless differing systems, created hundreds of years ago for 
combat, exercise and health or inner harmony, share common philosophies and 
techniques involving blocks, kicks, punches and stances. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no one system that is the best for everyone," said James W. McNeil, 
owner of Nine Little Heaven in Placentia, where he teaches kung fu. "The best 
system is the best system for you , the system that you can put 110% behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent visits to local martial-arts schools -- all teaching skills applicable 
to street self-defense -- provide a glimpse at three systems. Shotokan Karate 
</P>
<P>
 The room temperature rose palpably minutes after warm-up exercises began at 
Shotokan Karate of America in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 " Ichi! Ni! San! Chi! Go! " barked teacher Don De Pree, counting to five in 
Japanese as about 30 students, dripping with sweat, lurched down the floor with 
a series of lunges like a battalion of barefoot samurai warriors. Grimacing and 
glaring dead ahead, they spit out a staccato chorus of unintelligible 
grunt-shouts. Lunge, "Eeyaaah!" Lunge, "Eeyaaah!" 
</P>
<P>
 These loud " kiai ," said the school's owner and head instructor, Greg Scott, 
are part of "learning to express yourself without being intimidated by your 
opponent," be it a potential rapist, your boss, your insecurities or your 
environment, such as Los Angeles during the 1992 riots, where Scott worked his 
other job as a paramedic for the Los Angeles City Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Shotokan was founded by Gichen Funakoshi, who brought the aggressive karate 
style he formulated in his native Okinawa to Japan in 1922, said Muzila, of the 
L.A. Shotokan school. 
</P>
<P>
 It is characterized by low stances, linear leg and arm moves (rather than 
circular motions common to Chinese self-defense forms, hand techniques favored 
by the Okinawans or high kicks of Korean styles) and economy of effort, Muzila 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to "knock out your opponent with one attack: one strike, one 
kick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other styles emphasize trying to attack your opponent eight, maybe 10 times, 
and at different points -- the throat, the eyes, the groin -- bab, bab, bab, 
bab, bab! Real quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Felizardo S. Camilon, a pediatric ear, nose and throat surgeon at Children's 
Hospital of Orange County, says the mental discipline he learned first studying 
Shotokan years ago helped him through medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I got sleepy when I studied, instead of drinking coffee, I did katas 
(Shotokan exercises), and it would wake me up," said the 45-year-old 
first-degree black belt. "You need a lot of concentration to do it correctly." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, despite his long, intense schedule in the operating room, Camilon so 
enjoys his twice-weekly evening Shotokan classes that he rearranges his 
schedule to make room for them: He takes a late break for class, then returns 
to CHOC for another two or three emergency surgeries before calling it quits at 
midnight. He loves the exercise and stress release. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should see my karate uniform after class; it's soaking wet, like you put 
it in water. Yet, I feel so energized. And my wife tells me I'm a better person 
at home. I'm happier; I don't complain. If there's a problem, I say, well, 
we'll take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the Garden Grove school students are women, and they spar 
with men, who after all, are the attackers these women most likely have to 
face, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is not fair, and it's not even," he said, "so in practice we keep that 
idea. Women need to learn to fight guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Suyin Young, 24, didn't feel intimidated by the male-female ratio when she 
began training at the school in 1992, nor has she since. 
</P>
<P>
 But, "a lot of people are better and stronger than me," said the Cal State 
Long Beach physical therapy student, "and sometimes you get kind of scared that 
you're going to get hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Young said she was once bopped, hard, on the nose (accidents happen), 
and a punch to the stomach nearly knocked the breath out of her. But, she said, 
that goes with the territory, and the life lessons she learns through Shotokan 
are worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It teaches me not to be a quitter," she said. "When things get tough, I just 
try to push a little harder. I think, 'Yeah, maybe I have to suffer now, but 
eventually there will be benefits.' " Kenpo Karate 
</P>
<P>
 When 7-year-old Jerett Wasserman executes kenpo karate moves -- sharp, 
forceful kicks or incisive fist blows that slap the air then snap back like 
rubber bands -- he suddenly looks as fierce and determined as any adult at 
Steve Spry Karate Institute in Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like many other schools, defense, not offense, is this academy's chief 
emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to hurt than to be hurt, to maim than to be maimed, to kill than 
to be killed," said Kathy Murphy, who teaches there. But, "you don't hurt 
someone if they don't intend to hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Jerett and his sister Taylor, 5, practice their moves aplenty, but 
they have not turned Terminator on the playground or at home, says mom Terryl 
Wasserman. "They've learned a lot of self-restraint. They're taught that this 
is only for self-defense." 
</P>
<P>
 American kenpo karate is an amalgamation of several systems developed by the 
late Ed Parker, who came to the mainland in the 1950s from Hawaii, where he had 
trained in an Okinawan karate style, said school owner Spry. 
</P>
<P>
 In kenpo, which means "law of the fist" in Chinese, "we use our hands more 
than we do anything else," said Spry, who has hung his large color portrait on 
one trophy-bearing wall of his spacious studio. And, as in other systems, 
common sense, logical thinking and street awareness -- to avert problems before 
they start -- are stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 He tells students, whether in the mall or on Beach Boulevard, to walk with an 
air of confidence, remembering that they are "something special." 
</P>
<P>
 Student Nancy Hirschman, 36, who had never much liked any type of sport, said 
she took to kenpo almost immediately, despite the trepidation she felt before 
taking her first class 10 months ago. Visions of Bruce Lee movies danced in her 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little apprehensive, thinking 'I just know someone's going to throw 
me, and I'm going to quit,' " Hirschman said. "But they don't push you any 
farther than you can go, and if they're doing something in class that you don't 
feel ready for, you're not forced to do it, not unless you're comfortable, and 
then they'll walk you through it very slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 Students are also encouraged to support one another, and in fact, during 
classes, repeatedly applaud and cheer others on. 
</P>
<P>
 "If any one here ever booed somebody else, they'd be sent out," said 
Wasserman, whose husband also studies at the studio. "It's almost like a family 
here." Kung Fu 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil's Nine Little Heaven in Placentia is about the size of a roomy garage 
and boasts about as much flash. No wall-to-wall windows or plush front office 
here. A Chinese scroll painting, a potted plant, a yin-yang symbol suffice for 
decoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of its kung fu students, however, are arguably among the most dedicated 
around. Besides year-round weekly classes, the studio twice a year offers an 
intensive, three-month course consisting of four hours of training a day, six 
days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, most students put in an additional six or eight hours a day 
practicing on their own, says studio owner McNeil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for the person who wants to learn a lot in a short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil named Nine Little Heaven after one of the ancient Chinese kung fu 
systems he teaches. All of which, he said, essentially stress economy of force 
and simplicity of style. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have very difficult moves, big jumps or high kicks because they 
don't work in the street," McNeil explained. "Simple things work." 
</P>
<P>
 He further described a focus on physical health or "healing" and internal 
strength -- breathing techniques and mediation are used to channel energy to 
internal organs -- and body alignment. For instance, a punch isn't powered by 
the fist or arm alone, he said, but with added force from the lower abdomen and 
leg and hip movements. 
</P>
<P>
 "With proper alignment," he said, "you can throw anybody, I don't care how big 
they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a short practice break while other students continued to grunt away, 
Lory Lacy, 27, said she enrolled in this summer's intensive course because she 
eventually wants to enter competitive tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to fight," said Lacy, who owns a bike store in Irvine. Also, kung fu's 
internal focus is appealing to her, she said, as it is for Alex Garcia of 
Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like strengthening myself from the inside," said Garcia, who says the 
method is the sort he can keep up for a lifetime, exactly what he, at 25, plans 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're older," he said, "you can't rely on physical strength alone." A 
Look at the Different Styles 
</P>
<P>
 * Aikido (eye-kee-doe): A Japanese grappling and throwing style that has 
gained popularity from the movies of Steven Seagal, a black belt in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Goju-ryu (go-joo ree-yoo): An Okinawan karate style influenced by China and 
featuring a blend of hard and soft fighting techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 * Judo (joo-doe): A system similar to jujitsu, but mostly taught and practiced 
as a competitive sport -- as in the Olympics -- not as a form of self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jujitsu (joo-jit-soo): A Japanese grappling, throwing and choking art 
virtually devoid of punching and kicking techniques. Brazilian forms of jujitsu 
have become increasingly popular of late. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kenpo/kempo (ken-poe/kem-poe): A karate style heavily influenced by China 
and known for its lengthy combination attacks, almost to the point of overkill. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shotokan (show-toe-con): A Japanese karate style known for its emphasis on 
discipline and traditional training methods. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tae kwon do (tie-quan-doe): A Korean fighting system noted for its kicking 
techniques, particularly high and jumping kicks. Tae kwon do was a 
demonstration sport at the 1988 and '92 Olympics and will appear in that 
capacity again at the '96 Games in Atlanta. The sport has been voted full medal 
status for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tang soo do (tong soo doe): A Korean art nearly identical to tae kwon do, 
but with more emphasis on traditional training and self-defense than tournament 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wing chun (wing chun): A kung fu style that emphasizes protecting the body's 
center line. Wing chun was the system of choice for the late Bruce Lee when he 
first took up martial-arts training. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wushu (woo shoo): An acrobatic Chinese art noted for its aerial kicks and 
gymnastic-like movements.

DO RESEARCH BEFORE BECOMING A STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, Jim Coleman is executive editor of Black Belt magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joining a martial-arts school is a lot like purchasing a used car. You don't 
always know what you are getting until it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
 All schools are not created equal. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers do not have to answer to government regulators, and no consumer group 
acts as a watchdog to ensure the quality of instruction. Anyone, in fact, can 
acquire a business license, purchase a black belt, rent studio space and, to 
the unwitting public, appear to be the second coming of Bruce Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 How, then, can hands-of-lightning wanna-be's make a knowledgeable choice? By 
shopping around. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any other product, there are certain criteria that make some martial-arts 
studios more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 You will, of course, need to select a style to practice. Nearly all martial 
arts -- be they Japanese, Chinese, Korean or American in origin -- offer 
students self-defense training, physical conditioning, artistic expression, 
philosophy and tournament techniques. Each teacher, however, has a different 
emphasis and spends more instruction time in one area. 
</P>
<P>
 Visit as many schools as possible before making a decision. Meet the chief 
instructor and ask if it is possible to watch a class or two. If not, cross the 
studio off your list and move on. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher should have nothing to hide and should not expect prospective 
students to enroll in a program without first sampling the merchandise. Some 
instructors may even allow you to participate in a class before signing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay particular attention to how the instructor treats the students, and vice 
versa. Do they appear to respect each other? Is the teacher receptive to 
questions, or do they seem like an annoyance? 
</P>
<P>
 Some classes are relaxed; others are more serious and disciplined. One manner 
of instruction is not necessarily better than the other; it's a matter of 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 If the instructor instills fear in the students through intimidation, it is 
probably not in your best interest to enroll. Good teachers do not rely on 
bravado or need to have their egos stroked. 
</P>
<P>
 All martial-arts instructors have impressive-looking certificates to verify 
their training and background. The problem is, you have no real way of knowing 
if such documents are authentic. 
</P>
<P>
 Be leery of wild claims and excessively high belt ranks. There are very few 
legitimate karate instructors above fifth-degree black belt. The real proof of 
an instructor's ability is not his or her belt rank, but rather if the students 
are learning. (Most martial-arts systems award various colored belts, but it 
takes a minimum of about three years to attain a first-degree black belt.) 
</P>
<P>
 Check the school itself. The training area -- especially the floor -- should 
be clean and orderly. Does the studio have air conditioning and heating? Such 
amenities can make a big difference on extremely hot or cold days. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, inquire about the cost of training. Depending on individual 
needs and what a school offers, pupils can expect to pay about $40 a month or 
more. Some instructors require students to sign a contract, binding them to six 
months or more. If this is the case, find out if the contract has a 
cancellation clause, allowing you to quit after a short period without penalty. 
The contract should also allow extensions due to injury or personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides monthly dues, you may be required to purchase training equipment such 
as uniforms and safety gear. Fees for belt-rank testing can also drive up the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Make a list, if necessary, indicating the pros and cons of each studio. Then 
make your decision. A little research in the beginning can save you a lot of 
time, money and frustration in the long run.

KID STUFF: LOOK, MA, NO STRINGS; MAGICAL MOONSHINE THEATRE COMBINES PUPPETRY 
AND OTHER LIFE FORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I've got no strings to hold  
</P>
<P>
 me down, to make me fret, or  
</P>
<P>
 make me frown."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Pinocchio 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't count the cricket and the babe in fairy wings, puppeteer Michael 
Nelson and the wooden-headed Pinocchio actually have a lot in common. 
</P>
<P>
 Both spent time hanging around a woodworker's shop before breaking into show 
biz, and both find strings -- literal and figurative -- a real turnoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Founder of the touring puppet troupe Magical Moonshine Theatre, Nelson and 
wife Valerie have spent much of the past 15 years bouncing around the globe, 
bringing to life an international collection of folk tales and myths with their 
own blend of puppetry, masks and original music. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the Nelsons don't attach any strings to their puppets 
either. Ranging from three to seven feet in height, the wood, foam and fabric 
puppets (which the family and a small staff make themselves in a Napa studio) 
are manipulated through a series of rods and sticks by the couple, who are 
dressed in black and in full view of the audience. When his school schedule 
allows, their 11-year-old son, Benjamin, performs with them. During the show, 
the puppeteer's facial expressions reflect and enhance the puppet's actions, 
adding an extra measure of theatricality to the stories, said Michael Nelson. 
In some cases, the humans become characters themselves, donning custom-made 
masks and interacting with the puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, the family will visit Orange County for three productions of its 
"Animal Folktales of the Americas" show, Friday and Saturday at the Fullerton 
Museum Center (see accompanying information) and on Aug. 19 at Anaheim's 
Pearson Park Amphitheatre (7:30 p.m. at Sycamore and Lemon streets; $2 for 
adults, $1 for children 12 and under; (714) 254-5274). 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of blurring the line between puppet and puppeteer has become 
increasingly popular in Europe, where this kind of entertainment has 
historically been as much for adults as for children, if not more so. But it is 
infrequently seen in the United States, said Michael Nelson, who added that his 
family shows abroad typically draw a large number of adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this country, we sometimes see this kind of blending of puppet and mask 
and with actors and music in performance art," he said, speaking by phone from 
his office outside Napa, "but it's pretty unusual in family theater like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be willing to bet most kids in the audience don't notice us at all," he 
observed, laughing. "But in adults' minds, there's a kind of synthesis that 
comes from our faces mirroring the emotions of the puppets that's very unique." 
</P>
<P>
 A former cabinetmaker, Nelson fell into puppetry in 1979 while recuperating 
from a job-related injury. He put together a small puppet show for the 
preschool where his wife was teaching, and the local response was so positive 
that within a few years, he pitched the cabinetry business all together. A few 
years after that, his wife quit teaching to join him on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its formation, the Magical Moonshine Theatre has performed in 12 
countries and in seven languages. In 1987, Nelson was chosen to represent the 
United States at the international Puppet Institute in Charleville-Mezieres, 
France, where he studied under the late Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets. 
</P>
<P>
 When Benjamin was born in 1984, he was quickly assimilated into the act (his 
birth is listed in the company's history between the troupe's appearance at a 
national puppet festival and Michael's stint as a California Arts Council 
Artist in Residence). At age 2, he was doing "a little opening bit" before his 
parents' performance; by 6, he was performing as a puppeteer. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 12 different multicultural stories in the "Animal Folktales" 
repertoire, from which the Nelsons will select two or three for their shows in 
Anaheim and Fullerton. Among the possible choices: a Br'er Rabbit story, a 
South American folk tale, a Native American coyote story that mixes elements 
from Navajo, Pima and San Juan traditions, and a Hmong story that features a 
Southeast Asian style of shadow puppetry. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers have simple criteria when selecting the stories they will 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like humor in a story, so we do a lot of trickster stories -- the coyote 
tales and the Br'er Rabbit stories," explained Nelson. "And we look for stories 
that are intelligent and universal. But we don't really have specific morals 
we're trying to push. We let the story speak for itself."

SPECIAL SCREENING: 'THIEF' STILL STEALS THE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vittorio De Sica didn't set out to become a political filmmaker. He was more 
interested in art, in lyricism, in conveying the ineffable. 
</P>
<P>
 De Sica said as much later in his career, well after his reputation as one of 
the leaders of Italy's neo-realist movement in cinema had been established. In 
particular, he pointed to the celebrated "The Bicycle Thief" as a clear example 
of his commitment to poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1949 movie, screening tonight as part of the Bowers Museum's Italian Film 
Festival, tells the simple but not simple-minded story of a poor laborer and 
his son as they try to find their stolen bike. The backdrop is postwar Italy, a 
country left devastated by Mussolini, World War II and fascism. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty is everywhere; bomb rubble remains on street corners, and people look 
as grim as their surroundings. In describing a period beset by socio-political 
problems, De Sica couldn't help but become one of the more influential 
socio-political directors of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bicycle Thief" is a classic for several reasons, many tied to the 
understatement of De Sica's vision, which just makes the film all the more 
powerful. De Sica strips "The Bicycle Thief" to the essentials; it refuses to 
be pushy, and you tend to search out your own connection to the events, coming 
up with resonant interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 The naturalistic tone starts with the first scene, a sequence showing 
unemployed workers anxious for jobs in front of a government office. The 
protagonist (Lamberto Maggiorani) momentarily discards his pessimism when 
offered work raising posters advertising a Rita Hayworth flick. 
</P>
<P>
 He needs a bicycle to get to the sites around town but has pawned his own for 
food money. Faced with losing the job, his wife (Lianella Carrell) sells her 
dowry (six pairs of bed sheets) so Antonio can redeem the pawn ticket. The bike 
is stolen the next day, while he's working. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio and his young son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), begin a three-day search that 
takes them from a church to a bordello to a soothsayer's home to a dangerous 
confrontation in the thief's neighborhood. As Antonio's frustration grows, and 
Bruno's confusion over his father's anger increases, their world becomes more 
precarious. The film is a condemnation of what the war left behind; it's subtly 
anti-fascist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bicycle Thief" is also revealing on a technical level. De Sica, true to 
the neo-realist style, used natural lighting exclusively, giving the movie a 
gritty, documentary-like quality that many other filmmakers tried to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 The stripped-down approach was calculated. Along with Roberto Rossellini's 
"Rome, Open City" (1945) and Luchino Visconti's "Obsession" (1942) -- both 
neo-realism landmarks -- "The Bicycle Thief" was, in part, a reaction to the 
studio-made, government-controlled products of the 1930s. De Sica and others 
relished their roles as outsiders bucking the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the film won several European awards and soon came to the United 
States. Censors here weren't so appreciative, fighting to keep it out of 
theaters because of scenes involving hookers and Bruno's rather discreet 
attempt to urinate on a wall. Eventually, though, the quality of "The Bicycle 
Thief" shut up critics, and it went on to garner the 1949 Oscar for best 
foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Vittorio De Sica's "The Bicycle Thief." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Thursday, Aug. 11, at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Bowers Museum, 2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana.

under. Museum admission comes with ticket.

KIDS ON FILM: DOG AND CRAZY CO-STAR PUT THE BITE IN 'MASK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a free-lance writer who regularly contributes 
to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manic Jim Carrey gets even more so as a nice guy-turned chartreuse-faced party 
animal in "The Mask." As doormat Stanley Ipkiss, Carrey finds a ritual mask 
that transforms anyone who wears it into the person or (in one big scene) 
animal they've always wanted to be. Rated PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 "The Mask" has been described by a lot of people who ought to know as a 
high-tech animated tribute to the beloved low-tech classic Warner Bros. feature 
cartoons of the 1940s and '50s -- particularly those directed by the legendary 
Tex Avery. There are takes, bits of business, sight gags, sound effects and 
mannerisms lifted straight from several of the true immortals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the kids who attended a recent screening of the fast-paced, 
live-action-and-animation valentine didn't know about that history, didn't 
really need it and didn't really care. 
</P>
<P>
 They just knew they loved a movie that can combine a really, really loony lead 
character, a lot of lightning-quick animation and one smart dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends told me it was really funny, and I thought it was, too," said Adam 
Crine, 11, who was in Orange County from Henderson, Nev., to go to an Angel 
game with his father, Dave. "I really liked it, especially the part where the 
dog put on the mask and got those big teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the kids interviewed, that was the scene. Stanley, off to the Club 
Coco Bongo to save his sweetie and retrieve the mask, manages to let both 
temporarily slip through his fingers. But never fear. Diminutive Milo, 
Stanley's pet (who ought to have "The Wonder Dog" appended to his name), finds 
the mask, shoves his lovable beagle/mutt face into it and turns into the 
Ah-nold of the canine set. 
</P>
<P>
 "That dog was really funny," said Rakesh Shah, 15, of Anaheim, who added that 
he also relished the gag in which Stanley "flushed the bad guy down the 
fountain" with a convenient bit of Roger Rabbit-like animation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to slight the rubber-faced Carrey himself. The kids didn't have much use 
for him as Stanley, but "I really liked it every time he put on the mask and 
turned into the other guy," said Gammion McCloud, 14, of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part, I thought, was when he was in the club dancing with the girl 
and he got into that fight," said Henry Coleman, 15, of Anaheim. "That and when 
the bad guy got shot and just turned around and spit out the bullets. That was 
real good." 
</P>
<P>
 These bits of celluloid magic occur at the ubiquitous Coco Bongo (another nod 
to Avery, who set many of his cartoons in nightclubs). Stanley couldn't buy 
rhythm, but as Mr. Green Face, he moves like a shot, dances a series of 
impossible steps and provokes a wild gun battle, all of which he slips out of 
with aplomb (and a thoroughly vulcanized animated body). 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Rodriguez, 15, of Anaheim, said he particularly enjoyed Carrey's ability 
as a mimic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it when the bad guys got him and he acts out all these different 
parts, like Tiny Tim," he said. "It was funnier than I thought it was going to 
be. I liked it even better than 'Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.' "

SADDLEROCK RIDES TO SUCCESS WITH RANCH-STYLE FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddlerock Ranch, named for a working ranch in Malibu, is the newest link in a 
chain that includes a number of Orange County's best-known upscale restaurants, 
such as Kachina, Bistro 201 and Diva. But it's something of a departure for 
West Coast Restaurant Ventures, the company that owns the chain. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Saddlerock Ranch is heavily themed, done up in a hokey Western 
motif. For another, the place is geared toward families. The other restaurants 
in this chain mostly court a sophisticated night-on-the-town crowd through 
flashy decor and creative cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 The flashy approach has already flopped convincingly in this location. When 
Saddlerock Ranch was Zuni Grill, it served trendy Southwestern cuisine in a 
dimly lit, cave-like setting (the dining area had bulbous, faux- rock walls) -- 
and it struggled, despite having the lowest prices of any West Coast Restaurant 
Ventures operation. Meanwhile, not far away, Mimi's Cafe and Claim Jumper were 
playing to packed houses. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the company, under the direction of corporate executive chef John 
Sharpe, has totally revamped this place, installing a kid-friendly design and 
an all-American menu that cowboys, country boys and city folk alike can 
appreciate. Today, the restaurant is dominated by a mural of a mountain ranch. 
Walls are painted in earth tones and pastels, the tables covered in thick, 
spill-proof oilcloth. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovers of chic, take two steps back. These booths are off-white vinyl 
splotched with irregular patches of brown, like the hide of a spotted cow. 
Wagon wheel chandeliers hang down from the ceiling; a life-sized buckboard has 
been glued to one of the rear walls. 
</P>
<P>
 This new approach appears to be paying dividends. The last two times I 
visited, the floor was covered with peanut shells, people were lined up at the 
door and armies of children were frolicking on the enclosed patio, making a 
three-alarm commotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every entree here is under $10, a bargain when you consider what that 
gets you. Dinners come with squares of honey-butter corn bread, salad with 
homemade dressings and a choice of homey side dishes. That explains the 
shortage of appetizers, which are limited to soup, chili, shrimp cocktail, 
fried onions and a terrific guacamole made at the table. 
</P>
<P>
 I would come back just to take another crack at the guacamole. It feeds around 
four and is a steal at $5.95. The main component is Haas avocados grown on the 
eponymous Saddlerock Ranch itself. Friendly waiters mash up the avocados in an 
old-fashioned wooden salad bowl, then swirl in chopped tomato and a secret 
salsa. (Do you think Sharpe would divulge the recipe? No way.) 
</P>
<P>
 The fried onions have a curious name, onion cactus blossom, and they are 
indeed curious. The top of the onion has been sliced off and pieces pulled out 
of the center until the whole thing resembles, in its golden brown cornmeal 
batter, some kind of bionic sunflower. The result is tasty, but unwieldy. The 
onion pieces are not detached from the base, and when you attempt to pull off a 
"petal," you end up pulling the whole thing apart. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd be hard pressed to find anything too unfamiliar on the list of "large 
plates" (or, rather, entrees). Sharpe has stacked the deck this time, putting 
foods like beef brisket, turkey, Louisiana catfish, meatloaf, steak and ribs on 
his menu, and furthermore he does so with practiced skill. 
</P>
<P>
 The home-style brisket, for instance, is terrific: thick, nicely braised, at 
least 10 ounces for only $8. As if that wasn't enough, the meat comes with an 
accomplished creamed horseradish. Fresh Louisiana catfish can be had fried or 
blackened. I had mine fried, and discovered that meant juicy fish inside a 
crackly cornmeal skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey is more mundane than you'd hope for here, just a nondescript, 
cafeteria-type bird with decent gravy, a reasonably light corn bread dressing 
and a flavorful cranberry relish. The slab of ribs, though, might be the most 
impressive entree here. It's definitely the most expensive, at $11.99. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a big slab (it hangs out over both sides of the plate) of extra-lean 
baby back ribs smeared with a good, tangy barbecue sauce. I like the fact that 
you can really taste the mesquite it was grilled on. The steaks have a heavy 
mesquite flavor too. Kansas City steak is a 14-ounce cut smothered with onions. 
The rancher's steak (you or I would call it top sirloin) is a little on the 
tough side. 
</P>
<P>
 With the large plates you get a choice of two side dishes, and here the 
kitchen is in its element. The roasted corn on the cob, slightly blackened, is 
so good you may not even want to butter it. The macaroni and cheese (not for 
weight watchers) is properly creamy and soft, while the good creamed corn has a 
sweet, crunchy bite. 
</P>
<P>
 You may not be hungry for dessert, but if you are there are two choices to 
note. Corn bread pudding is a cross between bread pudding and Indian pudding -- 
a hot, heavy, maple-y dish of cornmeal, raisins, whipped cream and maple syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more impressive, and quite a bit gooier, is the restaurant's homemade 
chocolate turtle. Picture a rich brownie drenched in hot caramel sauce, then 
covered with chocolate syrup, nuts and whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddlerock Ranch is moderately priced. Appetizers are $1.95 to $5.95. Large 
plates are $5.99 to $11.99. Desserts are $2.50 to $4.25.

 Twenty decapods dill-cooked and chilled do a Swedish Crayfish Party make. At 
least that's how many of the boiled little crustaceans will be served to each 
person as a first course Tuesday and Wednesday at Gustaf Anders restaurant. 
Akvavit and beer is the chaser of choice. The party continues with 
Swedish-style meatballs and lingonberries, and winds down with apple cake and a 
glass of ice-cold punsch , a traditional Swedish liqueur made from spiced rum 
and flavored with the bark of palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening begins at 6:30 p.m. and the cost is $39 per person, including 
akvavit, beer, wine and punsch. Tax and gratuity extra. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at Gustaf Anders, "Phantom Phrenzy": Two local singers serenade patrons 
with music of the night by Andrew Lloyd Webber on Fridays and Saturdays from 6 
to 7:30 p.m., throughout the run of "Phantom of the Opera," which ends Sept. 3. 
Complimentary shuttle service to the Orange County Performing Arts Center is 
provided Thursdays through Saturdays. 1651 Sunflower Ave., South Coast Plaza 
Village, Santa Ana. (714) 668-1737.

 The Lab, a cluster of alternative retail shops and restaurants billed as an 
"anti-mall," is hosting a Farmers Market on Tuesdays from 4 to 8 p.m. Fruits 
and vegetables are sold in the parking lot behind the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the 15 vendors specialize in organic fruits and vegetables. There's 
also a bread baker, pottery thrower, incense and flower vendors, and live 
bluegrass and country music. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the biggest attraction is the time of day," Lab spokeswoman Linda Sadeghi 
said. "Most farmers markets are in the mornings, so if you're a working person 
or a student, you can't get there. Here, you can just pop in and out on your 
way home."

 The waiters still break plates for free, but dinner at Zorbas is half-priced 
Sundays through Thursdays this month. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the deluxe dinner -- a feast prepared for two or more including 
saganaki (cheese flamed table-side), 10 cold appetizers, Greek salad, and a hot 
sampler platter of lamb, chicken kebabs, moussaka (layered baked eggplant and 
beef topped with goat cheese), pastitsio (layered baked pasta and lamb), 
spanakopeta (spinach pie), dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) in lemon dill sauce 
and chicken Athena -- is now $12.50 a head. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner is served from 5 to 11 p.m.; reservations recommended. A four-course 
Early Bird Special, served until 7 p.m., is now $7.50. According to owner-chef 
Aristidis Deslis, the promotion marks the restaurant's fourth anniversary. 
Belly dancing Wednesday through Sunday.

PARKER'S PLACE: A LAST BASTION IN THE WILD; BASIC MEN, BASIC QUESTIONS: IS IT 
TIME TO GIVE WOMEN THEIR DUE . . . AND TAKE THEIR DUES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. JEFFERSON PARKER, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I belong to a club whose charter -- drawn up in the '50s -- states that only 
men can become members. It is a sportsmen's club. In our case, the main sport 
being target shooting. We have a few acres in the high desert upon which sit a 
clubhouse with a huge fireplace, two trap ranges and a few trailers members use 
for weekend getaways. The club members built it all themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for one weekend a month when some of the 30 active members shoot trap, 
the club property is very quiet. It is bordered by miles of federal and Native 
American land. Like most deserts, this one is rich with wildlife, if you're 
patient enough to look for it. It's the kind of place you go to get alone, get 
away from telephones, get away from traffic, or -- if you're one of those 
people who occasionally turns into someone you don't like -- get away from 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, women are there. Most often they are wives of members, sometimes 
daughters or friends. Once in a while a woman shooter tries her hand at our 
trap range. 
</P>
<P>
 But you'd never see one at a meeting -- because they weren't allowed 
membership. That was the way it had always been, and, since nobody was 
complaining, that appeared to be the way it would always be: a bunch of guys 
goofing around in the desert once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat mysteriously, however, a resolution was read a few meetings ago, 
which stated that club bylaws be changed to admit women as members. 
</P>
<P>
 It was mysterious because I hadn't heard anyone grousing about not having 
women in the club; I hadn't heard any serious discussion on the subject at all. 
But I came to understand that there was a faction within the club that was in 
favor of admitting women. I also came to understand that there was a faction 
strongly not in favor of doing so. The open discussion and vote was held last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand what happened, you must understand what we club members are 
like. I'm about to generalize here, so my judgments might be a little rounder 
and less specific than they might be, but such is the nature of the general. 
</P>
<P>
 We are what you might call basic men. We are working men. We are, for the most 
part, family men. We are not intellectuals and we are not dumb, but inhabit 
that vast middle ground. We have strong, assertive personalities. Many of us 
were raised in an earlier generation, one steeped in what one might call 
traditional male values. We are not, in the popular meaning of the word, 
"enlightened." Many members are veterans of foreign wars. Most of us, I would 
guess, grew up in other, more rural parts of the republic than Southern 
California. We are men a little bit dour about contemporary life; as 
traditionalists we tend to think back to a time that seemed better or a least 
more understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 We cuss. We drink. We smoke. We argue. We shoot and fish and hike. We work. We 
try to outdo each other. We compete against other clubs. We gamble on all of 
it. If someone needs help, we help him. We have large trucks, large dogs, large 
appetites. We get together to get away. Basic men. 
</P>
<P>
 With the mysterious appearance of the resolution, the idea of women joining 
the club was dangled before us, a controversial, contemporary, potentially 
divisive issue. All members were notified of the general discussion. All 
members were urged to attend the discussion. An odd feeling of battle seemed to 
fill the air -- so much would be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, plenty of opinionizing took place between members in private. As a 
yearling member myself and as a person more given to listening than talking, I 
heard the arguments but said little. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few women could take over the club," went one theory. "They'd be running 
everything before you knew it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have a women's auxiliary," went another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other clubs have women now, and it's been a success," went another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this club the way it is," said some. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need new members, and I don't see why they shouldn't be women," said 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife won't even come up here anymore because the clubhouse is such a 
pigsty," said one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we don't need her as a member," countered another. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to just leave well enough alone," some believed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't well enough anymore -- we're dying as a club," some answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any club without women is only half a club," stated one member. He is an 
older member, much respected, a man of considerable power and experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 So the stage was set for last week's vote. The meeting was far from packed. 
The same 15 guys who usually show up showed up, but there were enough of us to 
make a quorum. There was still a sense of anticipation in the air, however, and 
we went through the old business quickly in order to get to the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution allowing women as members was read, twice. 
</P>
<P>
 First were three or four questions that were technical in nature. Then the 
president, who according to the bylaws, does not vote unless as a tie-breaker, 
encouraged the members to speak their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 But, astonishingly to me a least, no one said much. A kind of uneasy silence 
prevailed, a silence that seemed packed with opinion, conviction, belief. 
</P>
<P>
 There we were, 15 basic men, with hardly a word to say on the subject that had 
been so vigorously addressed just a few weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
 One member spoke up to deliver an odd statement: "If we open this club to 
women and you don't vote in my wife, I guess I'll have to get a new wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Discussion ended and ballots were handed out. 
</P>
<P>
 I wondered what was going on here. Where was the heartfelt disagreement, the 
oratory, the heated opinionizing, the debate? What was everyone waiting for? 
</P>
<P>
 But as I cast my vote, folded my ballot and handed it to the sergeant-at-arms, 
I realized that there was no discussion tonight because everyone already knew 
exactly how they were going to vote. Everyone seemed to realize that no amount 
of talk was going to change anyone's mind, so why bother? 
</P>
<P>
 And even more than that, I guessed, each member felt so deeply about this 
issue that giving utterance to his convictions would only trivialize it. 
</P>
<P>
 The president counted the ballots, then called for two vice presidents to 
audit the count. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I guess I won't have to vote on this one," he said with a minor smile. 
"We have a unanimous vote. Resolution is passed."

DAY TRIPPIN': PACK A SNACK, PICK A PACK AND TAKE WALK ON THE IDYLLWILD SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to the Times Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For hikers, Idyllwild is the gateway to the San Jacinto Mountains. For 
climbers, the attraction is Suicide -- the rock, not the act -- and Lily Rock, 
also known as Tahquitz, huge granite outcroppings overlooking the town. Scaling 
those walls is one thing, but for visitors who prefer walking, the town's 
popularity is climbing even faster. 
</P>
<P>
 11 to 11:25: It's too beautiful in this part of Riverside County not to take 
at least a little hike, and in that case you'll want to pack a snack. The most 
popular items for the trail at Country Farms are trail mix (14 ounces for 
$3.35) and mixed dried fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 But walk softly and you can also take along some chips and salsa, perhaps 
Angelo's garlic salsa or Old Hawaii pineapple salsa. Mustard's a must with 
summer sausage: Try raspberry mustard or Hawaiian pineapple mustard. 
</P>
<P>
 Olives are a fine picnic item. You can choose from almond-, onion-, jalapeno-, 
garlic- and fancy anchovy-stuffed olives; Cajun-spiced, Italian-spiced and 
hot-spiced olives; country-style and kosher-style olives, and paprika, 
Sicilian, "pizza," "queen" and "perfect martini" olives. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling genteel? English scones come in "chocolate thunder," cranberry, 
traditional currants and nutmeg, wild blueberry, and lemon poppy seed 
varieties. If you stick around to camp, be sure to try one of these flavors of 
fettuccine -- apricot, blueberry, apple spice, pumpkin spice or even chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 11:25 to 11:50: Nomad Ventures carries "mountain equipage," and that means 
everything you'll need for a hike, including backpacks, day packs and pretty 
fancy fanny packs, some with fabrics and fringes suitable for a gala -- "those 
are more for shopping," admitted manager Lariann Baretta. Models with built-in 
water bottles, many in the $20 range, are very popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Pak-gammon is backgammon that fits in your pack. When you're really long on 
the trail, Shoe Goo II repairs worn shoes. If you stay in one place for any 
length of time, the Solo Sun Shower II produces hot water from solar energy, 
and portable hammocks cost less than $10. There's a solid brass whistle for $2 
in case you get lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Climbing equipment always bears colorful names. Shoes called Ballet suggest 
how better climbers climb, while another model called UFO suggests something a 
climber never wants to be. Protective devices include Hexes, Aliens, Friends -- 
appropriately named because your life can depend on them -- and Nuts, which is 
what most people think climbers are. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't try climbing without proper instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 11:50 to 1:20: Do try the Ernie Maxwell Scenic Trail, however, no matter what 
your ability level. It's a shady 2.6-mile hike, easy enough for kids, and you 
can turn around whenever you like. Because of the many species of trees, it's 
considered a good walk for beginning botanists. It begins at 6,100 feet, 
descends 600 feet and crosses streams along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Take in dramatic views of Tahquitz from the parking area; on the trail itself, 
you won't be able to see the rock for the trees. "It's not really a scenic 
trail," admitted one ranger. You can look out over Idyllwild, however, and 
across to Suicide, and there are a number of obvious clearings, fallen trees 
and rocks that are perfect for picnicking. 
</P>
<P>
 1:20 to 1:45: The Joy of Toys is a wooden-toy shop and motel registration 
office all in one, and Rudy Zachar serves as toymaker/innkeeper. You can watch 
him make toys in his workshop out back. "All hand-done, hand-painted, right 
here, I do it all," Zachar said. "I also instruct people, all free." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Zachar, his most commented-on toy is Noah's ark; it's $139.95 and 
includes 40 pairs of animals, loading ramp and Mr. and Mrs. Noah, and of course 
he'll ship. "It's our best seller," he said. Animals include ostriches, llamas 
and pandas. "Look at the panda real close, and he's actually a polar bear. Add 
a little black, he's a panda." 
</P>
<P>
 Biplane scooters -- the child steers with the wings -- are designed for ages 2 
to 4 ($94.95), while the age range for "name" trucks ($39.95 to $64.95, 
depending on the number of letters) is from 3 to . . . . "I've had women buy 
them for sons who are 35 or 40," Zachar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollhouses can be pricey (a two-story floor model, $224) but Zachar offers 
items for as low as 99 cents, such as wooden tops that go forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Zachar actually does carries a little merchandise that he doesn't make, such 
as Arnie Armadillo and Larry Lobster. Local rock jocks would go ape for a 
climbing monkey that shimmies up a pair of ropes ($19.95). "It's my No. 2 
seller," Zachar said. 
</P>
<P>
 1:45 to 2: The Candy Cupboard offers "old-fashion ice cream bars, and shaved 
ice in 28 flavors," says a sign outside. Ice cream bars ($1.50) are hand-dipped 
and rolled in the topping of your choice; shaved ice (80 cents to $1.50) is 
like a snow cone, only better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where your snow cones are hard, we shave the ice fresh, so it's softer," 
explained clerk Mickey Burch. "They're sweet but, with the ice, not as sweet as 
you think they'd be." Flavors include banana colada, blue raspberry and bubble 
gum, and you can get two flavors at once. Mango watermelon will slake that 
post-hike thirst.

SCIENTISTS DIG UP TUSK OF PYGMY MAMMOTH; ARCHEOLOGY: TOOTH IS PART OF FOSSIL 
FOUND ON SANTA ROSA ISLAND THAT IS BELIEVED TO BE MOST COMPLETE SKELETON OF 
CREATURE EVER FOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After hours of excavating a rare pygmy mammoth fossil, archeologist Don Morris 
scrambled up a steep, sandy cliff and broke the news to a colleague Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a tusk down there," Morris said breathlessly. "It's really nifty. 
It's all in the sand, and it's in terrific shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, the prehistoric skeleton discovered earlier this summer on Santa 
Rosa Island came complete with a 25-inch-long tusk, gleaming like polished wood 
in the bright, noonday sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The fossil is believed to be the most complete skeleton ever found of the 
mammoth that often grew no larger than a Saint Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
 This particular creature stood about 3 1/2 feet high at the shoulder, weighed 
as much as 500 pounds and lived as long as 75,000 years ago, scientists 
estimated after their first day of excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of scientists from across the nation began digging at the site Tuesday 
and, by Wednesday, had already discovered key portions of the ancestral 
elephant's frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully, two scientists used dental picks to scrape sand from the mammoth's 
pelvis bone, which could hold the answer to the animal's gender. 
</P>
<P>
 A biologist cleared sediment from the mammoth's eye socket with a trowel and 
brushed sand off the bridge of its nose. 
</P>
<P>
 The spine's jagged edge, bleached white from exposure, stuck out sharply from 
the eroding sand dune. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the spine that first drew a San Diego geologist to the fossil in June. 
Without that chance discovery, the rare skeleton could have been lost to 
exposure or to the sea, which is slowly eating away the aqua blue cove barely 
100 feet from the dune. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the luck of science," said Morris, archeologist for the Channel Islands 
Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The location of the fossil, mostly held in loose sand, is also a stroke of 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sand is like going through butter with a hot knife," said Larry 
Agenbroad, a paleontologist who studies mammoths at Northern Arizona University 
and the Mammoth Site in South Dakota. "I'm used to sand, but much more cemented 
sand." 
</P>
<P>
 The downside is that the steep slope makes it impossible to bring heavy 
equipment to the site. The digging is all done by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only way to do it," Agenbroad said. "Any machinery down here would 
already be in the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, every step on the eroding dune sends showers of sand down the hill. A 
bright orange safety fence is all that separates the scientists and their 
equipment from a sea cliff and the surf below. 
</P>
<P>
 Agenbroad speculated that the mammoth may have died in a landslide that 
covered it with sand. But whatever the cause of death, scientists believe the 
body was quickly buried in sand, initially sparing it from erosion and 
deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 years ago, they estimate, a gully or arroyo developed, and water 
began running down the dune onto the mammoth fossil. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rockwell, a geologist from San Diego State University, pointed to a darker 
spot on the sand behind the fossil, indicating the path of the gully. 
</P>
<P>
 The water eroded one of the tusks and some of the bones. Agenbroad projects 
that the skeleton is still 75% to 85% intact. Scientists have found some 
fragments, including a piece of shoulder blade the size of a dinner plate, 
farther down the dune. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big discovery, thus far, has been the tusk. The two-foot, extended 
tooth, made of the same substance as human teeth, survived for eons virtually 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Agenbroad has found nearly 100 tusks in a South Dakota sinkhole called the 
Mammoth Site, but has never excavated a pygmy mammoth. Wednesday, he rubbed his 
hand against the tusk's smooth surface, feeling the bevels at the tip. 
</P>
<P>
 From the tusk, Agenbroad began to speculate about the mammoth buried in the 
sand dune. He believes the animal was a male, about 40 years old. He also 
believes the pygmy variety descended from the Columbian mammoth, which he has 
found in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, mammoths swam to the Channel Islands, which were once one land 
mass lying about three to four miles off shore. After generations in the 
secluded spot, the species began to shrink -- an evolutionary process common in 
island mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 The real analysis, including a final estimate on the age of the bones, will 
come after months of study. Right now, the excavation team hopes to complete 
its dig by Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery has produced a flurry of interest in the islands. Channel 
Islands Aviation has already filled three plane trips to view the excavation 
site and is filling up a fourth trip set for next Wednesday.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; AT 70, MURAL ARTIST 
REMAINS A PERFECTIONIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After three arduous months of climbing scaffolding, 70-year-old Frank Martinez 
gazed at the mural alongside San Fernando Road and decided that, of all his 
works, this was the one of which he is most proud. And, he decided, it would be 
his last. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best I have done," he said to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The pride came not so much from the mural itself, which adorns a wall of the 
Al Jal Inc. building alongside San Fernando Road, but because he had been able 
to work with a group of Sun Valley teen-agers on the project and plant some 
idea in their minds about what art is. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martinez -- who considers himself an easel painter -- was unable to get 
too satisfied with himself. It may have taken a walk around his Pacoima home 
after finishing an artwork in his back-yard carport, or maybe another trip to 
Sun Valley to see the mural along San Fernando Road. But finally Martinez came 
to a conclusion: "My God, I think I can do better." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, the work will probably not be his last. Martinez is still striving to 
be a better artist, something that started when he began making shapes out of 
mud as a toddler. He quit high school to join the Army during World War II, 
then attended art school in London after the war. He never finished high 
school, but he has made a good living as a designer. The bell tower for San 
Fernando Elementary School, where he was a student, was one of his projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighbors don't even know that I can paint," said Martinez. His works 
have sold in Europe and Australia, and he has painted or designed murals for 
TELACU (The East Los Angeles Community Union), the Olympics and the Smithsonian 
Institute. But now he paints mostly so that his family will have "some memento 
that I existed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Valley Community Venture Council commissioned nationally known artist 
Joe Gonzalez to paint the San Fernando Road mural, depicting four eras of San 
Fernando Valley history. Gonzalez brought Martinez in to design the project, 
and it became more than just a work of art for Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it was a very happy marriage," Martinez said. He was glad for the 
chance to work with local Sun Valley teen-agers who had volunteered to work on 
the project. He wanted to teach kids how to paint again -- something he had not 
done since the 1960s, when he worked to discourage East Los Angeles kids from 
graffiti-writing. 
</P>
<P>
 There was less graffiti then, and, as Martinez puts it, "I still wanted to 
change the world." But that was before the responsibilities of a wife and five 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know something?" he said. "It's (graffiti) still going on. I think we 
failed. This new generation that has come in doesn't have the same love of 
country . . . hopefully, somebody can motivate them." 
</P>
<P>
 That failure seemed apparent when, a few weeks before the Sun Valley mural was 
completed this spring, a vandal threw black paint on the wall, splattering two 
panels depicting a Spanish mission and a stage coach. But the paint was sanded 
off, and the vandalism only delayed the dedication of the mural a couple of 
weeks, until late June. 
</P>
<P>
 But vandals have not returned. And Martinez is more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proof is that they have respected it," Martinez said. "Hopefully they'll 
keep respecting it." 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, he's hoping that vandals will come to appreciate art, or develop 
some healthy envy. "They may say, 'Why don't we show them we can do something 
better than that?' " Martinez said. "Fine. That's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Martinez wants to better his own work, perhaps with a mural honoring 
veterans from the Valley. He envisions a work involving a waving flag with the 
faces of the wartime Presidents superimposed on it along with the individual 
soldiers from World War I to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only a dream now -- someone would have to offer him the materials 
and the space.

AROUND THE VALLEY: ENCINO PROVES TO BE A FERTILE FIELD FOR LOVERS OF FRESH 
PRODUCE 
</P>

<P>
 This is the magic time. This is the golden time. This is the brief, shining 
moment when the tomatoes purchased in the San Fernando Valley taste like 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 And the corn tastes like corn. Melons are ripe and basil -- with leaves as big 
as your hand -- is the perfect accompaniment for those really real tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, August means unbearably hot and smoggy days. To me, it means 
mouthwatering tomato salads, pasta with fresh pesto sauce, grilled eggplant and 
ears of white and yellow corn. 
</P>
<P>
 And now these glories of summer are available in Encino -- better known 
perhaps for antiseptic-aisled Gelson's than as the home of the Valley's 
biggest, newest farmers' market. Opened just seven weeks ago, this market has 
the kind of produce that would make perfect hostess Martha Stewart salivate. 
</P>
<P>
 White eggplants. Yellow beans. Cantaloupes and honeydews of all sizes and 
shapes. Eight kinds of honey. Organic strawberries. And of course, those 
luscious red tomatoes -- from the tiny cherry variety to the giant beefsteaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Round a corner and there is six-grain wheat bread made with no eggs or dairy 
products. Brown or white eggs from chickens or ducks. Long, thick-stemmed 
sunflowers and bunches of fragrant lavender. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an eclectic mix. In addition to farmers selling home-grown produce, there 
is a seafood salesman with coolers filled with swordfish, clams and other fresh 
fish and a young artist selling earrings she makes with colorful glass beads. A 
pasta stand offers noodles of all shapes with sauces to mix and match. And, 
this being the Valley, there is the obligatory cappuccino and cafe latte stand. 
</P>
<P>
 The market is right on Victory Boulevard. Heading west, between Balboa 
Boulevard and White Oak Avenue, you see a dust bowl and there it is. Two Los 
Angeles Police Department Explorer Scouts guide cars and pickups into the 
so-called parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 All this and charity too. The market is run by the Organization for the Needs 
of the Elderly, a private, nonprofit group that gets about 5 cents on the 
dollar from the vendors to pay for senior citizen programs that include adult 
day care, home care and food service for older shut-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 volunteers spend their Sunday mornings -- the only day the market is 
open -- setting up the stalls, greeting and counting visitors and selling cold 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 They are obviously pleased to be there. Last Sunday, a volunteer sat in the 
hot sun holding an umbrella for shade, handing out flyers advertising the 
market's hours, 8 a.m. until noon. The market had about 1,000 visitors that 
morning, she said happily, adding that business was good despite the heat and 
the thick smog. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's leaders estimate that about 3,000 to 3,500 people visit the market 
each weekend, an estimate that seems high. Nonetheless, the market still is new 
-- it opened June 26 -- and the opening is still being advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 Banners publicizing it fly over sections of Ventura Boulevard and ads have 
appeared in newspapers. ONE officials say they expect the turnout to grow, 
especially once they begin holding special events. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, for example, the group plans to have Latino music and 
entertainment one week and a talk by the author of a cookbook that emphasizes 
farm-fresh produce the next. 
</P>
<P>
 The best advertising, the group says, is through word of mouth: neighbors and 
friends telling each other and using the market as a meeting place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people really like buying fresh produce and they enjoy dealing with 
the farmers," said Audrey Phillips, the group's director of community relations 
and volunteers. "Besides, how many supermarkets can you go to and find ducks' 
eggs?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's the one little reminder that fruits and vegetables are seasonal even in 
barely seasonal Los Angeles. It's real food sold in an all-too-real setting, 
complete with worms in the ears of corn and flies buzzing around the peaches. 
</P>
<P>
 And you had better bring a shopping bag. Farmers weigh the produce on old, 
rusty scales, returning the gems in small, plastic bags. More than a few and 
you need a larger, sturdier sack. 
</P>
<P>
 The more knowledgeable among us came prepared. One woman had a hand-held cart 
to carry her goods. Another -- more environmentally correct, perhaps -- carried 
a large net bag in which she loaded the fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 The prices are fine. Five ears of small white corn for a buck. A bag of 
medium-sized tomatoes for less than $2 and three baskets of strawberries for 
$3.50. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We aren't sure whether the prices are better at our local supermarket, but who 
cares? This is food from the earth, still dirty and displayed without mist 
makeup and bright lights. No plastic-wrapped cucumbers here. No waxy peppers 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if it takes a little care before feeding? The peaches could stand a 
day in a paper bag but the cantaloupe can't. One man, feeling the tiny melons, 
declared them too ripe, opting instead for a thicker-skinned variety. 
</P>
<P>
 The choices are plenty. The market has more than 25 farmers, food and other 
vendors. Their stalls, which coil in circular strings that snake through the 
big lot, might not be in the same place from week to week. 
</P>
<P>
 But finding your favorites again is part of the fun. 
</P>
<P>
 So goodby to driving across the Valley to produce stands at Pierce College. So 
long to the even longer drives northwest to the farms in Ventura County. And to 
Beverly Hills, Burbank, Calabasas and Santa Monica: You can keep your farmers' 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 We have our own now.

SERVICES HELD FOR POLITICAL 'MENTOR' RICHARD KAZEN, 59 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Funeral services were held Wednesday for Richard Ernest Kazen, a longtime 
Orange County-based political consultant who worked for Ronald Reagan when he 
was governor and later directed a political action committee made up of the 
state's key business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazen died of cancer Saturday at the age of 59. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick was kind of a journeyman political worker who made the system work," 
said Mike Stockstill, an Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies 
spokesman who worked with Kazen on United for California, a statewide business 
PAC that was a major financial donor from 1977 until 1989 when it disbanded. 
Kazen was the committee's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had all of the (political) skills. He understood campaigns, he understood 
fund-raising," Stockstill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach political consultant Scott Hart said Kazen was a "mentor" for a 
generation of consultants who followed him. "His forte was that he was very 
close to the corporate community," Hart said. "He was able to move into the 
political arena with those business contacts." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his political career, Kazen held several positions in the Reagan 
gubernatorial Administration, including the post of co-chairman of Reagan's Tax 
Reduction Task Force. He formed his own political consulting firm in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazen is survived by his mother, Elaine Kazen of Huntington Beach; his wife, 
Diane Kazen of Newport Beach; his daughter, Lynda Pitman and her husband, 
Larry, of Valencia; a son, Gregory Kazen, and his wife, Peach, of London; and 
two grandchildren.

DODGERS GET A BIG RALLY AFTER A DOSE OF REALITY; BASEBALL: LASORDA GIVES AN 
END-OF-THE-SEASON SPEECH BEFORE TEAM SCORES FOUR RUNS IN THE NINTH TO DEFEAT 
CINCINNATI, 6-3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The realization began to sink in Wednesday, somewhere around the time that 
Brett Butler updated the players on their impending strike and clearly around 
the time that Manager Tom Lasorda gave his end-of-the-season speech, thanking 
his players for being a first-place team. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were only two of the meetings held before the Dodgers' 6-3 victory over 
the Cincinnati Reds, in which they came from behind three times and won after 
scoring four runs in the ninth inning. It was only the third time in 43 games 
that the Dodgers have won when they trailed after eight innings, and the only 
time in 51 games the Reds have lost when they led after eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't give up tonight," said Eric Karros, whose leadoff home run in 
the ninth inning against reliever Jeff Brantley (6-6) tied the score, 3-3. 
"After the last two games, it was a big win and with a possible work stoppage 
and tomorrow we face (Jose) Rijo. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The strike) will hit home tomorrow, but today Tommy came in and gave his 
end-of-year speech to us, and if (the strike) happens, it happens. Nobody 
really wants to stop playing, especially in the situation we are in. But our 
backs are against the wall and we really don't have a lot of recourse but to go 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers will play their final game today before Friday's scheduled strike, 
which conceivably could end the season. If so, the Dodgers are in good position 
for a work stoppage, having clinched the top spot in the National League West 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Their bench came through again in this game.  
</P>
<P>
 "The difference is Todd (Worrell) -- because we are not swinging the bats like 
we were earlier (in the season)," said Mitch Webster, who led off the eighth 
inning with a pinch-hit double and eventually scored on a bouncer up the middle 
by Mike Piazza, which brought the Dodgers even at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell pitched the ninth inning, giving up a single and a fly ball by Tony 
Fernandez that Butler caught at the wall, but held the Reds scoreless to earn 
his 11th save.  
</P>
<P>
 But before Worrell came in, Ismael Valdes had relieved Kevin Gross to pitch 
the eighth inning and gave up the go-ahead run. Fernandez led off the inning by 
slashing a hard bunt by Valdes to a charging Delino DeShields -- who was moved 
to shortstop when Webster hit for Rafael Bournigal. DeShields' throw was late. 
Fernandez eventually scored on a two-out single to right by Thomas Howard.  
</P>
<P>
 "They know Bop (DeShields) was out there, and you don't see to many hitters do 
that -- it's a tough play to make," Bill Russell said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, who was managing in his 2,819th game, tying him for 16th on the 
all-time list, wasn't even around to see the end of this game. Having been 
ejected after the sixth inning by home plate umpire Bob Davidson because he 
though Bret Boone interfered on a caught-stealing attempt, he left Russell in 
charge. Fernandez, who stole the base, scored after Boone doubled to put the 
Reds ahead, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the ninth inning after Karros' 14th home run -- a solo shot over the 
center field fence -- tied the score at 3-3, Raul Mondesi tripled into the gap 
in left-center, sliding so hard into third base that coach Joey Amalfitano got 
about as much dirt on him as Mondesi did. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of dirt," Amalfitano said, "he is an exciting player." 
</P>
<P>
 Against left-hander Chuck McElroy, who relieved Brantley, Russell sent up four 
consecutive left-handed hitters, not so much defying the percentages, but 
because there weren't any right-handers left. And they all reached base, with 
Dave Hansen's pinch-hit single to short right field scoring Mondesi with the 
eventual winning run.  
</P>
<P>
 For the Reds, the loss put them only one-half game ahead of the Houston Astros 
in the NL Central, with only one game remaining before Friday. For the Dodgers, 
the victory was just another day closer to reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up this morning and was hoping to hear some good news," DeShields 
said, "then I heard that (union chief) Don Fehr walked out of the meeting, and 
I said, 'It looks like it's on.' "

<P>
 Technology, drug and food stocks paced a broad-based rally Wednesday, as bond 
yields held steady ahead of today's key inflation report. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials added 11.00 points to 3,766.76, but the stock market 
as a whole was much stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks, for example, gained 5.59 
points to 728.20, its highest close since mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners topped losers by 15 to 12 on Nasdaq and by 12 to 9 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that tech stocks in particular have been coming on strong in 
recent weeks, despite a renewed rise in bond yields. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stocks that have been pushed down the most (in the first half of the 
year) are coming back," said James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital in 
New York. "The stock market is doing better and people are looking for 
bargains." 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, however, investors coped Wednesday with the second leg of 
the Treasury's three-part quarterly "refunding." The government sold $12 
billion of 10-year notes at an average yield of 7.33%, about as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The refunding concludes today with the sale of 30-year bonds. Yields on 
existing 30-year issues were unchanged Wednesday at 7.57%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts fear that a government report due today on July wholesale prices 
could spark another selloff in bonds, if the inflation number is higher than 
expected. And Friday the government will report on July consumer price 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Any sign of a pickup in inflation could assure that the Federal Reserve Board 
will tighten credit next Tuesday, when the Fed's policy-making committee meets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, speaking to a House subcommittee Wednesday, 
warned that the economy generates inflation before it appears in the 
government's main price gauges. Many analysts viewed that as another sign the 
Fed is ready to tighten credit again. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the short end of the bond market actually rallied Wednesday, suggesting 
waning worries about the Fed. The yield on three-month T-bills tumbled to 4.47% 
from 4.54% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders cited heavy foreign buying of T-bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar was marginally higher as investors awaited the July 
inflation reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 101.35 Japanese yen, up from 101.28 on 
Tuesday, and at 1.584 German marks, up from 1.582. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tech stocks continuing to rally included Apple, up 1 to 34 5/8; 
Hewlett-Packard, up 2 1/2 to 82 1/4; Dell Computer, up 1 3/4 to 32 3/4; Micron 
Technology, up 3 1/4 to 42 1/4, and Texas Instruments, up 3 3/4 to 84. 
</P>
<P>
 * Software stocks were particularly strong. Lotus Development shot up 4 5/8 to 
40 1/4 after the firm inked an agreement with chip giant Intel to develop 
Lotus' popular Notes communications package to transmit images. 
</P>
<P>
 Other software winners included BMC Software, up 2 1/4 to 51 1/2; Powersoft, 
up 2 1/8 to 41 3/4; Broderbund, up 1 1/2 to 49 1/8, and Microsoft, up 5/8 to 54 
1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the telecom sector, LDDS Communications rose 1 1/8 to 21 after the 
long-distance communications firm said second-quarter earnings rose 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City-baed IDB Communications, which previously agreed to be purchased 
by LDDS in a stock swap, added 1/8 to 8 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks surged on renewed takeover speculation. Upjohn jumped 1 3/4 to 
35 1/2, Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 1 3/8 to 55 5/8, Merck leaped 1 3/8 to 32 
1/4 and Eli Lilly was up 1 7/8 to 50 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among HMOs, Southland-based PacifiCare's Class A shares rocketed 7 to 63 3/4 
-- a record high -- after a meeting between management and investors in New 
York raised optimism about the firm's earnings prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 * Food stocks were strong, which some traders attributed to buyout rumors. 
Heinz rose 1 5/8 to 36 1/2, Kellogg jumped 1 7/8 to 53 3/4 and CPC was up 1 to 
49 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, Dillard Department Stores plunged 4 7/8 to 26 5/8. The big 
retailer announced disappointing second-quarter earnings of 30 cents a share, 
compared to 35 cents in the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another big loser was New York State Electric & Gas, which sank 4 5/8 to 20 
7/8 after it became the latest utility to warn that it may have to cut the 
dividend on its common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Beset by increasing competition, a number of electric utilities have either 
cut their dividends this year or warned that cuts could be coming. But unlike 
previous such announcements, the news from NYSE&G failed to spark a selloff in 
utility shares generally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow utility index added 0.79 point to 189.36 for the day. American 
Electric Power rose 1/4 to 31, Consolidated Edison gained 1/4 to 29 and Pacific 
Gas & Electric was up 1/4 to 24 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, Tokyo's Nikkei 225-share average ended up 180.03 points at 
20,770.25. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX index eased 3.83 points to 2,160.37. In London, the 
FTSE-100 index 1.6 points to 3,167.00. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index also gave ground, losing 20.29 points to 2,574.67. 
</P>
<P>
 In Taipei, stocks tumbled from a four-year high on sudden concerns about 
inflation and interest rates. The weighted price index of the Taiwan Stock 
Exchange dropped 108.35 points to 6,836.56. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. commodity trading, orange juice prices fell sharply after a private 
forecasting firm projected an 11% rise in Florida's orange crop next year. 
</P>
<P>
 According to traders, Citrus Consulting International, a firm in Orlando, 
surveyed Florida's crop and projected the supply at 192.2 million 90-pound 
boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 September juice futures sank 3.65 cents to 93.3 cents a pound at the New York 
Cotton Exchange.

 U.S. businesses maintain 28 million electronic mailboxes, and the number is 
growing. So are sales of portable computers, which are becoming standard 
luggage for many business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 But outside the United States, just how easy is it to plug into your 
electronic world? 
</P>
<P>
 Phone wiring and dial tones differ from hotel to hotel and country to country. 
Hooking up to a hotel room phone line for modem transmission can be extremely 
frustrating. If you plan ahead, you can get yourself "wired" easily. If you 
don't, you may be up the proverbial creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on where you're headed, you may need more than a standard connector. 
And direct dialing isn't always possible, so you may have to do a little 
juggling after the local operator puts you through. Here are some other things 
to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 * Data jack. Many modern business hotels offer a data jack, normally included 
as part of the telephone. Here in the States, we have standard modular (RJ-11) 
jacks, so you can simply unplug the phone and plug in your modem. But modular 
jacks differ from country to country, so you may need an adapter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adapter. Whether you're faced with a data jack or a phone jack, you'll 
probably need an adapter if you're in a foreign country. They're easily ordered 
from firms such as TeleAdapt.  
</P>
<P>
 * Extension cord. There's a very good chance that the jack will be located 
behind the bed somewhere, which means you'll be sending e-mail on your hands 
and knees if you lack extra cord. 
</P>
<P>
 * Filter. Phone lines in many European countries, such as Germany and 
Switzerland, have pulse signals that are used to monitor phone usage and 
calculate the charges. Filters are available to eliminate these pulses, which 
disrupt modem signals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clips and couplers. If you're stuck in a hotel room with nothing more than a 
phone wire that disappears into a hole in the wall, you've got a couple of 
options. If you don't mind a little hard-wiring, you can travel with alligator 
clips and other tools to literally cut into the line. Or you can simply buy an 
acoustic coupler. It's a tried-and-true solution, but a heavy one. It 
eliminates any concerns about phone wiring because you simply connect it to the 
telephone handset. But it will add about 12 oz. or more to your luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 Portable computing may not be for everyone (yet), but the benefits of being 
able to access the information you need no matter where you are can be well 
worth the effort. I send and receive e-mail, connect to my company on Lotus 
Notes, access CompuServe and fax letters using a Dell notebook computer with a 
fax and modem. I even print in my hotel room, using a little two-pound Citizen 
notebook printer for letters and overhead transparencies. Total weight: about 
10 pounds. Not much for what amounts to a mobile office.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; CAN'T AFFORD A CORPORATE JET? 
SHARE ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH, CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corporate jets have long been a source of turbulence for companies, which have 
often found them difficult to justify to cost-conscious shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The perception that corporate jets are a luxury or an ego expense has lingered 
even though many firms say they save money and build productivity in the long 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a growing number of firms are finding a way to afford their own jets by 
leasing or chartering them or joining increasingly popular time-share programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, for example, New Jersey-based Executive Jet Aviation, one of the 
nation's largest jet time-sharing companies, announced a $150-million order for 
25 Cessna Citation V Ultras and an option for 25 more. The order is the largest 
ever placed for business jets, according to Cessna. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Jet already operates 37 business jets and has another five on order. 
Its sales have doubled every year since 1991.. 
</P>
<P>
 "The charter business is also showing strong growth," said Jane McBride, chief 
executive of Flight Time International, an air charter company based in 
Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of Executive Jet and firms like it reflects the changing pattern of 
aircraft ownership. Corporate ownership of jets is down but use is up, said 
Pete West, vice president of government affairs for the National Business 
Aircraft Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "General aviation has been in a depressed market, but the one element that has 
continued to grow is the use of business aircraft," said West. "If you look at 
the diversity of ways you can purchase or use cars, the same is now true of 
corporate jets." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the market's growth is that while companies want to use private 
jets because of their efficiency, the price is still too high, said Kevin 
Russell, senior vice president of Executive Jet. "Owning a corporate jet is 
prohibitive for most people." For example, it costs between $2.5 million and $3 
million, not including aircraft maintenance and flight department management 
costs, to own a Citation V Ultra, which seats seven passengers and has a range 
of 1,500 miles. The cost of a Hawker 1000, a nine-passenger jet with a range of 
3,200 miles, is about $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 By time-sharing, however, companies get the use of a corporate jet on demand 
for a fraction of the cost. Under Executive Jet's NetJet time-sharing program, 
for example, a company would pay $330,000 for a one-eighth share interest in a 
particular Citation jet. In addition, each owner pays a maintenance fee of 
$5,765 a month and $1,090 for each hour of occupied flight time. 
</P>
<P>
 The company pays only for time its employees are actually using the plane, not 
the time it takes to fly the plane to pick up the client. Each owner is 
allotted 100 hours of occupied flight time. Because Executive Jet has a fleet 
of jets, it is able to guarantee that an aircraft will be available on four 
hours' notice anywhere in the country, 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 80% of Executive Jet's time-share participants are companies 
that have not previously owned aircraft. The balance are those that have either 
cut back their fleets or are not expanding them and are using time-sharing to 
increase their capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The market for business jets has stalled in recent years. Sales of business 
aircraft peaked in 1981 with 389 sold, said Shelly Snyder, spokeswoman for the 
General Aircraft Manufacturers Assn. in Washington. In 1993, there were 198 
delivered, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first six months of 1994, manufacturers shipped 101 jets, compared to 
98 for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat slow sales, the General Aviation Manufacturers Assn. in conjunction 
with the National Business Aircraft Assn. has mounted a "No Plane, No Gain" 
advocacy program to tout the merits of using corporate jets. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, according to a study conducted by the accounting firm Arthur 
Andersen & Co., jets are used by 46 of the 50 firms on Fortune magazine's honor 
roll, which ranks the top firms in terms of return to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a popular misconception that only the largest companies use business 
jets, but many of the those on the list are smaller, more entrepreneurial 
companies, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate jets are most useful for companies that have manufacturing or other 
facilities in smaller cities and rural areas far from commercial hubs. 
Companies also find the planes are useful when executives need to get to 
several locations in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 There are far more airports in the United States that can handle general 
aviation aircraft such as business jets than those that can handle commercial 
jetliners, West said. "That means business jets are able to provide direct 
links to rural and outlying areas outside America's regional economic hubs," he 
said.

 Driving slowly down a country road, a salesman saw something blow past him. He 
sped up to see what it was and, at 70 m.p.h., finally caught it. Seeing that it 
was a chicken, he followed until it turned into a farm, stopping a few yards 
from a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The salesman parked his car, walked over to the farmer and asked 
incredulously, "My God, what kind of chicken is that? I clocked it at 70." 
</P>
<P>
 The farmer replied: "Take a good look, stranger. He's got three legs. We 
genetically engineer them here because our whole family likes drumsticks." 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing an opportunity, the salesman asked, "How do these chickens taste?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't know," the farmer said. "We ain't ever caught one yet."

STYLE FILE: BY DESIGN; LEADERS OF THE PACK; TRAVEL MAKES THE CASE FOR 
HIGH-TECH, LOW-MAINTENANCE FABRICS, EASY STYLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's summertime, and traveling should be easy, sartorially speaking at least. 
</P>
<P>
 Space-age fabrics for pragmatic jet-age travelers, from knits in natural 
fabrics to wrinkle-resistant cottons and lightweight wools to high-tech 
polyester and other synthetics, help make the going great. In easy-to-wear 
styles, these fabrics can be scrunched into a small suitcase and emerge to 
perfection hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrinkle-resistant collections are available from Eddie Haggar, Jantzen and 
Cherokee, among others. Or, for a new wrinkle, consider Issey Miyake's Pleats 
Please collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleats Please is a travel-friendly micro-pleated polyester collection. Terri 
Howard, divisional merchandise manager at I. Magnin in San Francisco, says it 
did particularly well in the first two weeks after it was introduced in I. 
Magnin stores in San Francisco and Phoenix and in the I. Magnin catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You roll the merchandise right up, and you don't ever have to worry about its 
condition in your luggage," Howard says. "The pleats are permanently set, so 
you have an elegant look as soon as you take the clothes out of your suitcase." 
</P>
<P>
 Each garment weighs only a few ounces and is made of fabric that drips dry in 
less than an hour -- the perfect candidate for hotel sink laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 Miyake's line consists of turtlenecks, shells, T-shirts, shorts, pants and 
skirts, ranging from brights to neutrals ($95 to $290). 
</P>
<P>
 If your junket calls for more business than pleasure, suit up in 100% wool. 
But not just any wool. Make it mid-weight, says Tony Krohn, sales manager for 
Brooks Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For both men and women, what you want in wool is a year-round weight, which 
is nine ounces," he says. "It's not too hot in summer or too cold in winter, so 
it'll take you from Miami to Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, it's a resilient fiber that performs well. More than cotton, linen 
or even wool blends, it recovers well from abuse. So when you hang it up in 
your hotel room, the fibers recover." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks Brothers mid-weight wool suits range from $300 to $1,000, for men or 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let a clothes crease or two put a wrinkle in your brow. Expect them on 
natural fabrics such as linen, cotton and washed silk. Even embrace them. 
</P>
<P>
 Wear your linen loose and unpressed -- and pack it in a hard-sided suitcase if 
you're really bent on minimizing wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a slouchy silhouette, wrinkling is certainly acceptable," says 
Deirdre Corcoran of Episode, which has a store in Costa Mesa. "Linen in 
particular is a good, breathable fabric that is easy to travel with -- if 
you're the kind of person who understands that that's what linen does." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles designer David Dart seconds that notion. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the wrinkles in it is really the way it's supposed to be. You simply 
roll the clothing and stick it in your suitcase," he says. "And when you 
arrive, pull it out, throw it on a hanger and hang it in the bathroom so steam 
can get at it while you shower." 
</P>
<P>
 If you like linen but can't abide rumples, pick a linen blended with viscose, 
cotton, silk or wool. It's a bit heavier and crushes much less than all-linen. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you choose to take along, follow these simple rules: 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep packing to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important not to introduce too many concepts when packing for an 
excursion," Corcoran says. "Everything that's in your suitcase -- with the 
possible exception of a black evening gown -- should really mix and match with 
everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a weekend, limit yourself to three colors. You can enjoy your travels and 
not think too much about what you're wearing." 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't jettison the essentials. Make a list of basics. For the beach, it will 
include a crushable sun hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, waterproof beach shoes, 
beach bag and two swimsuits, one for a quick change. 
</P>
<P>
 * The more you organize, the less you'll take, and the less you'll have to 
pack, unpack and tote around. So fight the urge to pack everything you love. 
You'll hate it when you have to lug it everywhere -- and you'll have nothing 
fresh to come home to. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you didn't pack enough, the worst that can happen is that you might have 
to buy something on the road. Keep in mind that the size and cut of European 
clothing differ from American standards. For size-conversion charts, consult 
travelers' guidebooks. Some European department stores offer charts at their 
information desks.

 A dmit it. The '60s weren't just about peace, love and music with a message. 
The years also featured some of the most diverse fashion, with more "uniforms" 
than any previous era. Baby boomers can stay smug knowing that their kids have 
kept it all alive -- not only through activism and granola -- but recycling a 
style that defined a generation. The Doc Was In Then 
</P>

 Dr. Martens at Woodstock? It's true. When Sid Vicious was still in grade 
school, the requisite footwear of the punk army had its day in the summer sun 
of 1969 thanks to original raucous rocker Pete Townshend. The Who guitarist 
gave political activist Abbie Hoffman a swift boot when he rushed the stage in 
an effort to rile the crowd (check out the Woodstock movie for the hard-hitting 
visuals). Times have certainly changed. Twenty-five years later, mainstream 
America has embraced "Docs" and Woodstock as a symbol of unity (counter-culture 
attitude optional). Notes a spokesman for Dr. Martens in London: "DMs have been 
an integral part of every major music and fashion movement since the 1960s. 
(They) have the ability to adapt to any trend." A Dead Trend 
</P>
<P>
 It's the wardrobe associated with those long-haired, peace-loving, 
dirty-footed, groovy kids that called themselves hippies: India gauze shirts 
and dresses; Army surplus gear; tie-dye tank tops; fringed Daniel Boone 
jackets; Benjamin Franklin specs; Mexican saddle bags; ankle-length, patterned 
wrap-around skirts, peace sign patches. And all of it is still available and 
selling like mad at vintage stores such as Taxi Taxi in downtown Huntington 
Beach (outfit pictured). "There's always a 'Woodstock' going on, but it's 
called the 'Deadhead show,' " says owner Jinx Varona. "The kids who keep 
discovering the Grateful Dead keep (the look) revived." Teed Off Youth 
</P>
<P>
 While Mom and Dad wax nostalgic over a concert they never even attended, their 
kids are tuning in to all the hype. There's the cable telecast at $50 a pop. 
And record stores such as Tower are selling compact discs of the original 
Woodstock artists at a discount, as well as the Official Woodstock T-shirt. For 
$14 you too can be a part of the retro regurgitation. "It seems to be 
college-aged kids and younger who are buying the shirts," says Mike Williams, 
manager at Tower Costa Mesa. "We haven't gotten a lot of older people looking 
at them yet." ROSE APODACA JONES

FAUX PAS REPORT: NO NEED TO LET GOOD SLACKS GO TO WAIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Waistlines are a touchy thing for guys. They like to remember themselves in 
high school when the tape measure didn't have to be more than 32 inches long. 
As they get older, they watch that waist bulge past 33, 34, 35 and more. But 
admitting it to themselves, and buying appropriate pants, is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why you see so many guys with slacks that have pleats pulled apart and 
bulges over their belts. If the slacks are in good condition and made of wool, 
it may be time to bite the bullet and tell the tailor those painful words: "Let 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
 "Any good worsted or tropical wool slack, especially in dark colors, is fine 
for letting out," says Matt Blanchard of Polo Ralph Lauren in Costa Mesa. "With 
cotton or lighter colored slacks, there's always the possibility that you'll be 
able to see pinholes or a color difference in the area that's been let out." 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that better-fitting slacks will make you look slimmer no matter 
what your waist size. And once you have slacks altered, you can always have 
them taken when the sit-ups start working. 
</P>
<P>

 Ear drops: Long earrings are always in style, but, like hemlines, they vary. 
Lots of women are still wearing earrings that drop onto their shoulders, not 
realizing such may be out of date. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old 'shoulder duster' isn't as popular as it used to be," says Barbara 
Martinez of Shreve & Co. Jewelers in Costa Mesa. "The style today is an 
'old-fashioned' dangle, where the earring drops down an inch below the lobe." 
</P>
<P>
 If it's an earring you really care for, it may be possible to shorten it to a 
more modern length. But if you're stuck on that long droop, hang with it and 
just don't wear it to any chi-chi parties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Really Big Shoe: There are a few guys walking around on what you might think 
are large feet, but they just have ill-fitting shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are very attuned to foot size," says clothing buyer Bill Rigioni of 
Huntington Beach. "They know not just whether they're a 7 1/2 or a 9, but also 
whether they're a narrow or wide and by how much. Guys just get an 11 when they 
might need a 10 1/2 EE." 
</P>
<P>
 A shoe that's wide looks smaller than one that's long. When buying shoes, 
always have your shoe size checked to see if it's changed over time. If you can 
get away with a wider or a narrower width rather than a longer shoe, take it.

SHOEMAKERS PUT THEIR BEST FEET FORWARD; SOCIAL CONSCIENCE: THEY MADE THEIR 
MONEY RUNNING ROCKPORT, RYKA AND REEBOK. NOW EACH IS INVOLVED IN A SPECIAL 
CAUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their common professional calling consists of cushioning the human foot's 
contact with the ground. They are cobblers, shoe magnates who might well be 
content to lace up their hefty profits and let others fret about mankind's 
moral bunions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul Fireman, Bruce Katz and Sheri Poe are three shoemakers with soul. 
Beyond their chosen line of endeavor they share little but the geography of New 
England. Yet in each of these footwear manufacturers, entrepreneurial acumen 
has fueled an equal appetite for social activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Their causes are varied. Fireman, chief executive officer of Reebok 
International Ltd., has taken on human rights as his personal and corporate 
mission. Katz, co-founder of Rockport Shoes, sold out of the shoe biz and used 
the money to leap into the arena of community change via on-line communication. 
Poe, founder of Ryka Inc., is a rape survivor and has dedicated herself to the 
goal of ending violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
 Fireman -- only partially in jest -- offered regional similarities as a 
possible explanation for their high level of social consciousness. "Maybe it's 
something in the water," he said. "And if it is, we should spread it around." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are these shoemakers' stories. Paul Fireman, Reebok 
</P>
<P>
 Just a dozen or so years ago, Paul Fireman is entirely comfortable admitting, 
he wouldn't have recognized social responsibility if it had come calling at his 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never heard of it," said the 50-year-old Fireman, who was raised in a 
family of shoe manufacturers in the gritty hamlet of Brockton, Mass. "I didn't 
even know the words." 
</P>
<P>
 Fireman, who today continues to fight a middle-aged bulge despite a serious 
golf habit and frequent trips to the company gym, knew only that "I wanted to 
make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? Reebok, after all, was going gangbusters; Fireman had acquired an 
athletic shoe business just when health-obsessed Americans began insisting on 
entire wardrobes of high-priced, sport-specific footwear. In 1981, Reebok 
recorded $1.5 million in sales. Five years later, the figure had grown to $916 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Fireman, meteoric profits were not inconsistent with an altruistic 
company spirit. "From Day One," he said, "I didn't want this to look like, 
taste like or smell like an American corporation of the '50s, '60s or '70s." 
</P>
<P>
 He was a onetime shoe salesman, not some senescent social protester. Even so, 
"I had grown to hate the mainstream world, with all the compromises you had to 
make just to show up at the front door. I thought Reebok should operate 
slightly differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Well aware of the boss's philosophy, Reebok's ad agency approached Fireman in 
1986 with a proposal to sponsor an international rock music tour for Amnesty 
International. "It seemed like a good idea," Fireman decided, even if $10 
million was a lot of money for a few concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did Fireman realize when he agreed to sponsor Amnesty's Human Rights 
Now World Concert Tour -- featuring such celebrities as Bruce Springsteen, 
Peter Gabriel and Sting -- that a funny thing would happen on the way to the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got bit by the bug," Fireman said in a 1992 speech at the Columbia 
University Business School. "Amnesty opened our eyes, and we became passionate 
about human rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling was not initially mutual from the human rights community. "They 
were skeptical to the extreme," Fireman said. "They kept us in abeyance" -- a 
polite understatement, Fireman conceded. "We were suits. They held in disdain 
the business community as a whole. In their minds, we were businessmen who did 
all the wrong things." 
</P>
<P>
 Better, Fireman was gently informed, to stick to the traditional "side-door" 
route of quietly pouring money into existing foundations. No thanks, Fireman 
said. In 1988, he initiated the annual Reebok Human Rights Awards, offering 
no-strings-attached grants of $25,000 to people 30 or younger who were making 
"significant contributions to the cause of human rights -- often against great 
odds." The Rev. Carl Washington of Los Angeles was a 1993 winner, recognized 
for his leadership in curbing violence after the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fireman -- often with one of his Human Rights Award board members, former 
President Jimmy Carter, by his side -- was more than just the guy who handed 
out the checks. He was also the CEO who made sure that human rights production 
standards were in place at 40 Reebok-affiliated facilities around the world, 
and who made sure that "business decisions were made inclusive of human 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly traded Reebok's profits were flat in 1993, and some hard-eyed 
corporate analysts and executives wondered about this father of three -- 
married to the same wife since forever -- who didn't look a bit like Ben or 
Jerry yet still preached a do-gooder doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it good business?" Fireman asked. "I don't know if it sells any more 
shoes, but I don't think that's our intention." Fireman is entirely aware that 
he might just as well have opted for a more benign cause than the social ills 
of East Timor, Kurdistan, Mozambique and even these United States. But he is 
adamant that "we didn't do this to become powerful. We did it to do some good. 
We did it to change the world." 
</P>
<P>
 And anyway, he said, "It feels better. What the heck?" Bruce Katz, Rockport 
</P>
<P>
 The last thing in the world Bruce Katz (pronounced Kates) intended to do was 
follow in his father's professional footsteps. He built his first computer at 
13, back in the days when a computer was the size of a rec room, and turned up 
his toes at the mere mention of the shoe business. That was the domain of his 
dad, Saul. Engineering, his major at Cornell, was what Bruce had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But he got sidetracked by good, healthy American ambition. There he was in 
1972, haunting the hippie emporiums of Harvard Square, hawking moccasins from 
the back of his pickup. "Basically I went into the (shoe) business to make a 
little money, and then leave," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 To his amazement, "I really had fun, and I learned a lot." He quickly realized 
that he was strolling in, so to speak, on the beginning of the 
walking-for-fitness movement. With his father, he launched Rockport shoes, now 
the metatarsal mainstay of many foot-weary Americans. For a while, Katz 
published Walking magazine while also marketing proudly clod-hopping footwear. 
He watched his little back-of-the-truck enterprise grow to a $300-million 
success story. 
</P>
<P>
 If Katz was becoming a millionaire, he was also turning into a believer -- "in 
social change, and political activism, which I had never been much involved in. 
I got convinced that you could actually change things." 
</P>
<P>
 But while funding fitness-related medical research, Katz chafed at the number 
of hands extended in his direction. "Giving money to various organizations was 
very frustrating," he recalled. "The need is endless." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Katz sold Rockport -- to, coincidentally, Reebok. Determined "to go 
out and solve some of the world's problems," Katz headed straight to San 
Francisco, his idea of heaven. There he established an investment firm and a 
philanthropic group called the Springhouse Foundation, which benefits the 
needy, the environment and the arts.  
</P>
<P>
 But the fit was far from perfect. In the nonprofit arena, the 47-year-old Katz 
said from his office in Sausalito, "I felt completely uncomfortable. People sat 
around and talked and talked. Nobody had the operational sense that I found in 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still tinkering with his computers, meanwhile, Katz cast about for a 
community-based cause that would employ his engineering skills as well as his 
entrepreneurship. He was particularly taken by the WELL, an Internet 
conferencing system started in 1985 by the crowd who had brought out the Whole 
Earth Catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
 WELL participants share ideas in "forums," or discussion areas, ranging from 
virtual reality to cooking. A bachelor living in San Francisco's serene Pacific 
Heights district, Katz was electronically surrounded by the likes of lawyers, 
doctors, musicians, carpenters, hobbyists and more. It was a neighborhood pub 
without all the smoke, a seminar with no exams, a calorie-free dinner party. It 
was a cozy, cosmopolitan salon where if a bore showed up, you could delete him. 
</P>
<P>
 In this disembodied but burbling intellectual environment, Katz was a 
contented computer camper -- so much so that in 1991, he became a 50-50 partner 
in the enterprise. Last January, he bought the whole electronic campground for 
an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz's first order of business was to increase accessibility to the WELL, the 
better to stimulate wider discussions and, perchance, change from the ground 
up. While "up until now, communication with large numbers of people was really 
the bailiwick of the very wealthy," he said, a vast conferencing system enables 
community groups to transmit their messages anywhere they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said his modest goal is to get the whole world talking to each other, and 
to generate change from the kind of conversations that used to take place over 
the back fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of this effort, Katz believes, "is going to come some really nifty ways to 
organize people and to make some changes that will make all of our lives 
better." Sheri Poe, Ryka 
</P>
<P>
 Days after the death of Nicole Brown Simpson, Sheri Poe was galled that even 
for a moment, Simpson's abuse by her husband might have been seen as a private 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the crux," Poe said, fuming behind a desk in Norwood, Mass., that is 
adorned with equal numbers of family pictures and athletic shoes. "Society has 
bought into this ridiculous idea that domestic abuse is a private issue. And 
it's not. It's a public concern." 
</P>
<P>
 You'll pardon Poe if, looking disarmingly slender for a woman who gave birth 
to her fourth child five months ago, she leaps onto her soapbox from time to 
time. As the CEO of Ryka Inc., which Poe describes as "the only athletic shoe 
company exclusively devoted to the women's market," she has been known to 
remind unsuspecting rival executives, mostly male, that this country boasts 
about three times as many animal shelters as women's shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 She spews out facts and figures confidently -- and accurately: Every 15 
seconds in this country, a woman is beaten; domestic violence is the leading 
cause of injury to women between 15 and 44, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 She comes by her knowledge and passion honestly -- if also unfortunately. 
Hitchhiking to work 22 years ago, a naive 19-year-old freshman at Southern 
Illinois University, Poe was raped at gunpoint. She tried to press charges but 
was made to think that it was her fault because she had been hitchhiking. 
Besides, she said, her attacker had friends in the police department. There was 
no chance, they told her, of a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe "coped" with her shame and anger by becoming bulimic. She said exercise 
finally helped her regain her self-esteem. Plagued by an aching back and 
perpetually sore knees, Poe blamed the shoes she wore during a decade or more 
of heavy-impact aerobic exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 If the right product didn't exist, Poe reasoned, she would just have to invent 
it -- and in 1987 she and her first husband, a marketing executive, started 
Ryka, named for her then-mother-in-law. A female investment banker, who 
conveniently happened to also be an exercise fanatic, raised money through 
public stock offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, the Ryka pitch was unusual -- because to Poe, tending to 
"total well-being" for women meant accompanying each pair of shoes with an 800 
telephone number offering 24-hour support and information for female victims of 
violence. She also urges retailers to pass out safety booklets published by her 
Ryka ROSE (for Regain One's Self-Esteem) Foundation, which funds treatment, 
education and prevention programs to help end violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
 When Poe's marriage broke up, she kept the company -- as well as the ROSE 
Foundation, to which she has pledged 7% of her annual pretax profits. To date, 
Ryka's shaky performance has meant that the promise has not put huge dents in 
Poe's pockets. Since going public in 1988, Ryka has yet to record a full year 
of profitability. But Poe, a former "pink bag lady" for Mary Kay cosmetics, 
calls herself a "gut-sense entrepreneur" who projects brighter days for her 
company as well as her foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, critics accuse Poe of talking a good game when it comes to crimes 
against women. Some have sniped that Poe has stooped to the cellar of "cause 
marketing," turning into a professional rape victim who exploits her own 
experience in hopes of bigger sales.

 "Yeah, yeah, yeah," she scoffed. "I've heard that, and I say, obviously you've 
never been close to anyone who is a survivor. Because if you think it's a 
picnic to discuss this, you're wrong. I'd have to be a real masochist to relive 
that kind of pain, just to benefit this company." 
</P>
<P>
 Poe met her second husband, a biochemist who is the father of her two youngest 
children, while scuba diving. With so many kids, her home exudes a kind of 
pleasant chaos, she said. Often she welcomes the escape to the relative 
tranquillity of an office, where most of her employees are female, and where 
many come to work attired in workout clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said she will not give up the cause she has pegged as her own. "I have a 
commitment to bring forward the issue of violence against women, and I'm going 
to do that till the day I die."  
</P>
<P>
 She smiled, perhaps ruefully. "Which is good, because it's probably going to 
take that long."

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: WELCOME BACK, M. SAINT LAURENT

 "More people in America know the name Opium than know the name Yves Saint 
Laurent," Ariel De Ravenel, Paris-based spokeswoman for YSL fragrances, told us 
the other day. Sacre bleu! No wonder the spectacularly shy Saint Laurent is so 
eager to touch base with his American constituency. Next month, the designer -- 
who hasn't been in the States since his 1983 retrospective -- will host 1,500 
of the fashion world's finest at the Statue of Liberty in honor of his new 
perfume, Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really call it a launch, since the perfume has been available at 
Saks since June," De Ravenel says. But Sept. 12 will mark the first private 
bash ever permitted at Liberty Island. And because the statue was a gift from 
the French, we couldn't think of a more appropriate setting. 
</P>
<P>
 It all reminds us of the glamorous 1978 launch of Opium, held aboard a Chinese 
junk in New York harbor. To olfactorily relive those halcyon days, we stopped 
at the Bullock's cosmetics counter and sprayed ourself with the pungent 
fragrance. Mmmmm, disco. Mmmmm, wide leather belts. Mmmmm, Mr. Inside Out's 
freshly laundered shirt. He'll be, uh, transported.

 I Saw the Sign, and It Opened Up My Eyes: Professional volleyball players are 
scantily clad. Viewers like that about the game. But players, or human 
billboards as we think of them, were running out of advertising space. Yikes! 
Your standard visor, tank shirt, bikini bottom, or trunks, holds only so many 
logos. The solution? Tattooing.  
</P>
<P>
 "Almost all parts of our players' bodies are for sale," says Debbie Rubio, 
spokeswoman for the Miller Lite/AVP Tour. Rubio assures us, though, that the 
tattoos are temps -- better than the ones kids stick on themselves, but still 
not a lifetime commitment. Three-time Olympic medalist Steve Timmons was the 
tour's first tattooed man. Look for fans to follow suit. By popular demand, 
active-wear stores are selling the Redsand tattoos.

 Who's That Girl? It's downright disconcerting to see Lisa McRee, KABC-TV's new 
anchor, looking so incredibly chic at 11 p.m. Even if we weren't padding around 
barefoot without a drop of makeup and happy to turn out the lights, we would 
still be impressed. Great clothes, great hair, great makeup. A real threat. Not 
to us, of course. But watch out, Diane, Jane, Joan and Paula. Where did Channel 
7 find its Ann Martin replacement? Upstairs, as it were.  
</P>
<P>
 McRee was a correspondent on ABC's news magazine "Day One" and can still be 
seen on cable's "Lifetime Magazine," which ABC produces. McRee may be from Ft. 
Worth, but she went to UC San Diego and worked for KCST in San Diego and KERO 
in Bakersfield, which makes her a local success story to us. So we're 
chauvinistic -- with taste.

 If the Shoe Fits -- and Is Hideous -- by All Means, Wear It: The newest entry 
in the ugly-but-comfortable footwear market is also perhaps the oldest. 
Haferls, the shoes made in Bavaria for 300 years, are now being aggressively 
marketed by German entrepreneur Jerome Person. He made up the clunky, 
side-tied, long-tongued, rubber lug-soled shoes in a fancy French factory that 
also makes stuff for Hermes, and in the last six months has sold them to such 
places as Barneys New York (men's) and American Rag (women's and men's). 
</P>
<P>
 So who's wearing these $190 to $235 shoes? Cutting-edge designers Philippe 
Starck and Vivienne Westwood, for starters. Here in L.A., Person said, Earvin 
(Magic) Johnson and Damon and Keenen Ivory Wayans. "They're being purchased by 
older customers, people in their 30s and 40s," says the 26-year-old Person, 
who, we suggest, ought to learn a little diplomacy in this city of eternal 
youth. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Barefoot and Well-Rounded: Speaking of shoes, Miss America contestants will 
stroll down the runway without them on Sept. 17 during the NBC broadcast of the 
pageant's swimwear competition. "I'm sure there will be many people who think 
it's a step forward," said Leonard Horn, pageant chairman, of the barefoot 
contessas. Don't be so sure, Leonard. We suggest you check out the beachwear 
styling of America's premiere designers, who are showing their winter resort 
collections in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Tyler's bathing beauties wear strappy high-heeled sandals. So do Isaac 
Mizrahi's. But then, Miss America is nothing if not an eternal fashion 
anachronism. Now that we're all in the mood for tall hair -- inspired by 
"Absolutely Fabulous" Patsy and her Ivana Trump-esque beehive -- want to bet 
that Miss America shows up in a deflated do? Just watch. We certainly will.

BOOK REVIEW / BIOGRAPHY; TWO-STEPPING THROUGH A LIFE AS MELODRAMATIC AS ANY 
COUNTRY BALLAD; PATSY: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF PATSY CLINE BY MARGARET JONES ; 
HARPERCOLLINS $23, 328 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL DORRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 1950s and early '60s, Patsy Cline fought her way up the slippery 
country music ladder to become an American icon. Her saga inspired two 
Hollywood movies, her face appears on a postage stamp, her records continue to 
sell. Killed in a plane crash when she was just 30, her renditions of songs 
like "Crazy," "I Fall to Pieces" and "Sweet Dreams" have become standards, 
groundbreaking crossover hits that opened a door to female country singers the 
likes of Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Margaret Jones has written a definitive chronology of Cline's short life 
that reads as it was lived, like the melodramatic but hopelessly "true" lyrics 
typical of a Nashville ballad: Tough girl from the other side of the tracks, 
abandoned by a feckless (and possibly incestuous) father, despised and ignored 
in her hometown of Winchester, Va., has a voice of pure gold -- and knows how 
to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 After countless career mistakes and false starts, after a string of unhappy 
love affairs and compromises, after being banged up badly in a head-on 
collision, she makes the charts six times in a row. But is she still crying 
behind the smiles? You better believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meticulously researched -- Jones interviewed and quotes everyone from husbands 
to colleagues to fans -- "Patsy" presents a multi-sided portrait of its 
subject, a woman about whose secret self few people seem to be in agreement. 
Some call her a "woman's woman," others a "man's woman." Some see her as driven 
by ambition, others as relatively sweet and unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
 On several points, however, there is general consensus: Cline had a powerful, 
not-to-be-denied natural talent like no one else of her generation; she made a 
loyal pal ("anything, anytime that you needed her, she is there") and a 
fearsome enemy; she rarely put on airs; enjoyed off-color stories and hard 
liquor, and she knew how to have a good time when she had the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news about "Patsy" is that the book will make you want to re-listen 
to Cline's work -- a helpful and complete discography by Don Roy is appended. 
No matter what else was going on in her life before and after a recording 
session, she was unstinting when standing in front of a microphone, a 
determined perfectionist, "the greatest road buddy that anybody ever had," 
self-taught and with a wide range of styles at her disposal. When "she did what 
she was supposed to do -- go out there and just act dignified and sing . . . 
she just destroyed the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that after 300 pages of Patsy did this, then Patsy did that, 
and then Patsy did the other thing, we still don't have much of an idea of who 
Patsy Cline was. We see her from a distance, from the outside, the woman other 
people imagined or needed or resented. We get an inkling of the sexism that 
surrounded the Nashville music industry, of how hard it was for a "gal" artist 
to break through as a solo or headliner act. We hear about exploitative 
recording contracts, adultery on all sides, many, many befringed cowgirl 
outfits, and what it was like behind the scenes of early regional television 
broadcasts. But Patsy Cline? She remains an enigma. 
</P>
<P>
 That's too bad, because we sense there is a deeper story here, a driving force 
that is fueled by anger and desire, a passion that is heard in the phrasings of 
her most poignant musical moments. Whatever else she was, Patsy Cline was a 
chameleon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patsy never seemed to look the same. She could be a big, healthy farm girl, 
tired and fat, plain, bodacious, brassy and, toward the end of her life, coolly 
elegant. Some people say they never noticed her facial disfigurement from the 
head-on collision. Others said when they talked to her, they tried hard not to 
stare at the scar. Her skin was flawlessly smooth except for parentheses 
framing her mouth from laughing. Her front tooth was chipped, from opening 
bobby pins, she said." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' promises of psychological insight -- the skewed relationships with men, 
the mother who was more like a sister than a parent, the rivalries with less 
gifted but more conventional performers -- are dangled but never fully 
explored. Patsy Cline, the life -- as opposed to Patsy Cline, the music -- is a 
melody played too cautiously just out of earshot. But we get enough of Cline's 
candor and impatience with reticence that we sense that she might say, as the 
book's conclusion and the much prefigured plane crash draws near, "If you're 
going to tell it, tell it like it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Sad to say, in reality or in legend, Patsy Cline has not yet gotten her proper 
due.

R S V P / INTO THE NIGHT: 'PRISCILLA' PREMIERE FAR FROM A DRAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: Tuesday's benefit premiere of Gramercy's "The Adventures of 
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" at the Cinerama Dome. A party followed at the 
Palace. Writer-director Stephan Elliott said it was altogether fitting that his 
musical comedy about three drag queens traversing the Australian Outback 
premiered "in what looks like a giant bra cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Elliott; two of the film's stars, Terence Stamp and Guy Pearce; 
Gramercy's Russell Schwartz and Steve Flynn; plus 900 guests, including Aidan 
Quinn, k.d. lang, Matthew Modine, Julia Sweeney, Lea DeLaria, Stephen Dorff and 
Ann Magnuson. The big hit of the evening was Julie Newmar, who appeared to be 
the living inspiration for half the drag queens present. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buzz: If the Academy establishes an Oscar for Australian Outback drag 
queen musicals, this has a lock on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "The big joy of Australian drag is it's incredibly clever," Elliott 
said. "They're no longer imitating women anymore. They've taken the Shirley 
Bassey and the Barbra Streisand out of drag. It's moved on. You can do anything 
you bloody well want." 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably Missing From the Film: "We had a dress entirely made out of toast 
with different spreads on it," Elliott said. "But when we got out in the desert 
the flies took off with it. There must have been 8 million flies. We also had a 
seafood hairdo made from squids, octopus and whatever, but that idea got dumped 
when it hit 110." 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: The tone was set by the three dozen drag queens present. The money 
spent on eye shadow could have financed the Streisand tour. Blond wigs, chiffon 
wraps, full-length gloves, sequin dresses, pearls and rhinestones abounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Tickets were $100; $41,000 was netted for L.A. Shanti, an 
HIV/AIDS support group. 
</P>
<P>
 Commentary: One woman noted that a particularly flamboyant drag queen, "looks 
like Angelyne on a bad day." Her friend said: "That's a redundancy."

THE LATEST IN GIRDLES IS STILL AN OLD DECEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY SKRZYCKI, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was at in a department store, stocking up on cotton underwear and minding my 
business, when something unsettling caught my eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Displayed on the racks nearby were pair after pair of some product that for 
all the world looked like underwear. These things had control panels of Lycra 
and other stern-looking synthetics engineered to -- let us put this delicately 
-- squeeze back into the body vast adipose rolls of jiggling flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 What were these things? 
</P>
<P>
 I started reading the labels. The Shapewear Smoothie Firm Control Body Briefer 
had a hidden panel for extra tummy control. Or, as the small print said, "Does 
what your diet doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 I moved on to the Vanity Fair Shaping System, a sort of mini-slip with a 
little stretchy thing under it. Its tag: "Shaping the body, mind and spirit." 
This was a very sexy black number. 
</P>
<P>
 But for "sheer power," Bali suggests the "Waistnipper," a contraption 
descended from the whale bones of the Victorian era. It offered a color code of 
tags so the woman who wanted her waist nipped could choose light control (blue 
tag), moderate control (fuchsia) or firm (purple). "Firm" resembled a hot-water 
bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who want to go whole, er, hog, and maybe even have a few garters, 
there were bodysuits ($39.50) that allow you to pour everything in there from 
breast to butt. It must be tough to breathe in one of those things, not to 
mention what misery it must be in the summer. And how in the world would you go 
to the bathroom? There were at least a dozen hooks and snaps barring the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it hit me. These weren't underpants. These weren't control anythings. 
These were girdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that they called themselves girdles. Not one of these garments, from the 
smallest of panties with panels to the biggest mother of all controllers, 
breathed the word "girdle." 
</P>
<P>
 This is because, in the ethos of the 1990s, girdles are bad. Girdles are 
something frumpy and fusty, something essentially dishonest. Something our 
mothers wore. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1960s, girdles began to suffer their deserved fate. It had 
something to do with the decision to renounce all things restrictive. Which was 
easy to do when one was, say, 23 and still could respectably wear a two-piece 
bathing suit because one's belly resembled the surface of a kettle drum and not 
the surface of a kettle. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to today. 
</P>
<P>
 It is amazing how the protocols of the 1960s have been belly-bumped out of the 
way by fleshy imperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are wearing girdles, just so long as no one calls them that. 
</P>
<P>
 What is wrong with a little benign self-deception? This is what is wrong: 
Girdles are not about fixing problems, but hiding them. And not calling them 
girdles just aggravates the insult. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a stomach or a big back porch it is OK to display it proudly, on 
the theory that if men can have huge guts hanging over their belts without 
social penalty, then by God, women should have that right too. And if you have 
a stomach or a big back porch and decide you do not want it because it somehow 
diminishes you or threatens your health or feelings of self-worth, then it is 
fine to fix it through rituals of self-denial and frenzied activity. 
</P>
<P>
 But not this. 
</P>
<P>
 The rows and rows of control garments and underpants with funny panels in the 
front are proof that women have seized the unseemly middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's be honest here and call a girdle a girdle.

CELEBRATE THE SEA ON A JET-SKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He's known as "Rad Brad" on the Jet-Ski racing circuit. "Freestyle is my 
favorite event; there's jumping, tailspin and submarining, where you submerge 
the Jet-Ski completely under water," says Brad, nearly breathless at just the 
thought of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jet-Ski Nationals will take place Sunday at Long Beach Marine Stadium as 
part of the monthlong 62nd annual International Sea Festival. Anyone can enter 
the racing competition up until 9 a.m. race morning. There are beginner, 
novice, expert and pro divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonstop action goes from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., with closed-course racing held 
simultaneously with the slalom time trials and obstacle course. When those 
events take a break at 1:30 p.m., the freestylers get two minutes each on the 
water to dazzle the judges. (And don't worry about having to go ski-to-ski with 
Rad Brad: He won't be competing because he's promoting the event, and he says 
he can't do both. 
</P>
<P>
 The first five places will get trophies in the amateur divisions; the pros 
will take home the entry purse. About 200 entries are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectator admission is $6 for bleacher seating; children under 10 get in free. 
For information, call (714) 493-4669. For information on other Sea Festival 
events this weekend, including the Oar and Paddle Regatta, women's volleyball 
and the Catalina Ski Race (8 a.m. Sunday), call the festival hot line at (310)

COVER STORY; LEADER OF THE PACK; CHRISTOPHER R. POOK IS THE DRIVING FORCE 
BEHIND A $200-MILLION PLAN TO BUILD AN AUTO RESEARCH CENTER AND CREATE 13,000 
JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say what you will about automobile race impresario Christopher R. Pook, but 
he's a consummate salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Making a pitch a few weeks ago at Long Beach City Hall for a research and 
development park and test track on the Long Beach-Signal Hill border, Pook 
showed rapt City Council members pictures of rusting oil tanks and contaminated 
dirt on the prospective site. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he showed an architect's rendering of gleaming structures, rustling trees 
and racing cars circling a grassy infield. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he flashed a pair of slides on a screen with the magical words "Jobs" 
and "Real Estate Enhancement" in block letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook had apparently pushed the right buttons. Praise rippled up and down the 
City Council dais like "the wave" going through a football stadium, with one 
council member after another taking up the theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Groping for superlatives, Councilman Les Robbins blurted: "This is a very 
important project whose potential is beyond comprehension." 
</P>
<P>
 In a city where real estate values have sunk and jobs have disappeared like a 
desert mirage, good news arrives like a rumor of water among the desperately 
thirsty. 
</P>
<P>
 The $200-million Transwest Park Research and Development Complex, with its 
promise of 13,000 full-time jobs and an eventual economic impact in the 
nine-digit range, has the potential to be very good news indeed -- though some 
auto industry experts have already voiced skepticism about the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Pook, 53, the British-born former travel agent who brought Grand 
Prix to Long Beach and an aggressive entrepreneur whom everybody, including 
Pook himself, describes as "a bulldog," gives the project special credibility, 
several council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very astute businessman -- an expert in his field," says Councilman 
Mike Donelon. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the project -- including research facilities, test track, 
alternative fuels center, driving school and a planned four auto races a year 
-- has a long way to go before it is even officially considered by the city 
councils of Long Beach and Signal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, officials of Signal Hill, which has jurisdiction over 55% of the 
200-acre site, are sounding less eager than those in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion it has tremendous potential," said Signal Hill City Manager 
Douglas LaBelle. "But the environmental impacts need to be very critically 
analyzed -- noise, traffic, that sort of thing. We're proceeding down that 
middle road." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Long Beach Community Development Agency and the Signal Hill city 
manager's office have been directed to study the plan, which relies on city 
redevelopment money and private investment. The developers -- including J.A. 
Jones Construction Co. of North Carolina, the third-largest builder in the 
country, and Affiliated Development Group, a Pasadena-based firm headed by 
former Long Beach Transit Chairman George Medak -- must produce an 
environmental report.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a group headed by racing tycoon Roger Penske is moving full-speed 
on plans for a track in Fontana, 50 miles away in San Bernardino County, which 
should be completed in 1996. That's a year before the earliest possible 
completion date for the Pook project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penske track already has commitments from Indy car and stock car 
sanctioning associations to stage races there, said Walter Czarnecki, executive 
vice president of the Penske Corp. Czarnecki added that under current plans, 
"there will ample opportunities for testing -- tire companies, auto companies, 
educational institutions, alternate fuels researchers." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on the two similar proposals, a spokesman for one major auto 
manufacturer with facilities in California said "I can't believe Southern 
California will support" two new test tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't count Pook out, Long Beach officials caution. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, as Long Beach-based McDonnell Douglas was laying off 30,000 
workers and the U.S. Navy was dismantling the Long Beach Naval Station, there 
has always been one reliable piece of good news for the city's merchants and 
budget-crafters. Every spring, 200,000 or so fans gather over three days at the 
city's waterfront to watch racing cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Grand Prix, which Pook founded in 1975, brings about $30 million 
worth of business to Long Beach and gives the city's sputtering 5,000-room 
hotel industry its most profitable week of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook is talking about a more permanent monument to his preoccupation (He's 
"Prix-occupied," says the license plate frame on his 1994 Lexus), converting a 
dreary-looking oil field into a modern racetrack surrounded by several 12-story 
alabaster office towers and with college professors with stopwatches studying 
automotive prototypes careening down the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a complicated project," says Pook, a short, compact man with a 
goatee and a sweep of iron-gray hair curling over his collar. "You've got an 
ugly piece of land over here. You've got a human resource over there. And 
you've got a huge market." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The market is the auto industry, which Pook contends suffers from lack of 
research and testing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook's idea is to link a large pool of workers with technical skills -- the 
unemployed or underemployed Southern California aerospace workers -- with the 
car designers and manufacturers in the region and with university-based 
researchers. Transwest would provide custom-built space for the automotive 
design companies and a 1.25-mile track to test their products. 
</P>
<P>
 The most visible proponent of the Transwest complex is a pugnacious, 
blunt-spoken former race driver with a reputation for embellishing his past but 
with a proven talent for salesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pook walks out of a room after talking to you, and you pretty much believe 
what he wants you to believe," says Hank Ives, Pook's publicity director for 
eight years in the 1970s and 1980s. "He's very forceful." 
</P>
<P>
 Pook's harshest critics are usually former employees and associates, who talk 
about his abrasiveness and his penchant for ruthlessly "stepping over bodies" 
in his headlong rush for success. Most would not talk on the record for fear of 
business or employment repercussions. "I still have to do business in this 
city," said one former employee who was fired by Pook. 
</P>
<P>
 But the racing impresario himself concedes that his unbridled perfectionism 
and compulsive attention to detail has, on occasion, led to friction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a real pain in the ass (with the people he works with)," Pook concedes. 
"I want (a job) done to completion and usually to perfection. I'm known for 
that. There's a little bit of overkill there maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an exceptionally arrogant man," said one former associate, who asked not 
to be identified." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pook's obsessive finagling with details is most apparent during the three days 
of the Grand Prix, when his staff is put on a rigid minute-by-minute schedule. 
He proudly displays a copy of last April's race-day schedule, 15 single-spaced 
pages of designated tasks, from a 5:15 a.m. check of radios at the Grand Prix 
headquarters to an 8 p.m. compulsory shutdown of exhibitors' booths. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like conducting a symphony orchestra," Pook says, "except instead of 
having a guy in black tails and a bow tie you have a dispatcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Somerset, England, Pook is the son of an engineer-inventor father with 
an interest in car racing and a mother who was the heiress of a family of 
hard-cider manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 From his youth, Pook wanted to be a car racer, he says. But he wasn't an 
especially talented driver. As a novice, he crashed on a treacherous stretch of 
rural road during a minor cross-country race. "A tree ran out and hit me," he 
says jokingly. "Actually, a wheel came off." He suffered injuries to his knees, 
pelvis, arm and shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, with his ambitions to be a professional driver shattered, he headed 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook tells a story about agreeing, before he came to America, to work in a 
management job with the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. "I got there on a 
Tuesday, left on a Saturday," he says. "I hated New York, so I asked to be 
relieved of my contract, and went to Chicago. Spent two hours driving around 
the Loop and areas around it, then I went to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Pook has also said in previous interviews that he was sponsored in this 
country by Bellflower real estate entrepreneur Miles Shook, who hired him to 
run some apartment buildings. Shook could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook says -- as does his official biography, distributed by the Long Beach 
Grand Prix Assn. -- that he came to this country armed with a marketing degree 
from the University of London and a modern languages degree from the Sorbonne 
in Paris. A spokeswoman for the English school said it has no record of his 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who admire Pook shrug off the occasional discrepancies in accounts of 
his life. "Remember, he's a salesman," says Pete Biro, an editor at Drive 
Magazine and Pook's former public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1960s, Pook moved to Long Beach and set himself up as a travel 
agent. "Long Beach is the world's best-kept secret," says Pook, a past chairman 
of the Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. "It's strategically located. You 
can get to LAX, downtown L.A. or Orange County with ease. It's pleasant and 
airy." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1973, he had strong connections at City Hall, handling much of the city's 
travel business, as well as picking up contracts from Cal State Long Beach for 
transporting athletic teams and handling travel arrangements for the city's 
Convention and News Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 On Memorial Day, 1973, Pook says, he was listening to a radio broadcast of the 
Indy 500. It was at a time when city officials, with a new convention center on 
their hands, were searching for ways to market Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself, 'That would be easy. Run some cars around the streets and 
get everybody's attention,' " Pook recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 He set to work on the idea, wending his way through the city land-use process 
(with a few well-placed friends in city government running interference for 
him, according to critics), winning the sanction of the Automobile Competitions 
Committee of the United States for the race and raising hundreds of thousands 
of dollars in operating capital and prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 He also brought in some partners, including former racer Dan Gurney, Long 
Beach lawyer Don N. Dyer and three other Long Beach-area investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The last hurdle was winning approval from the California Coastal Commission, 
which has a say in every major new project located within 1,000 yards of the 
coastline.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When a Long Beach resident objected to the prospect of howling race cars 
tearing through city streets, the commission held a hearing in San Diego. After 
Pook promised to charter buses to carry elderly residents to the country on 
race days, the commission approved the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grand Prix organization did send three busloads of people to Big Bear that 
year, but most residents elected to stay in town and watch the race, Pook says. 
Now, the race is held along Shoreline Drive, where the city's bluffs block much 
of the noise.  
</P>
<P>
 The first Long Beach Grand Prix in September, 1975, was a public relations 
coup for the city, with pictures of the city's waterfront broadcast all over 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guess what," says Pook, with undisguised pride. "People started knowing where 
Long Beach was." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the race was a financial disaster, losing more than $300,000 and 
prompting charges from critics that the city had subsidized the event to the 
tune of $190,000, despite promises from City Manager John R. Mansell "not to 
spend a dime of city money" on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money was in the form of expenditures for city services, including 
modifications of city streets to accommodate the course of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Grand Prix, the first European-style Formula 1 race, using sports 
cars, lost another $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1977, however, Pook's organization had paid the city back for race-day 
services, and he and his backers began to make money. Profits grew even larger 
after 1984, when Pook switched from Formula 1 racing -- with high costs for 
transporting fragile racing cars from Europe and limited fan interest in the 
United States -- to Indy-style racing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Long Beach Grand Prix Assn. opened its own headquarters in 
a converted bakery on Pacific Avenue, only a few blocks away from the would-be 
Transwest Park. There, in offices plastered with race memorabilia, a full-time 
staff of 34 handles marketing and public relations jobs, serves as consultants 
for other sporting events and pieces together the next Long Beach race. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook's second wife, Ellen, runs the company's merchandising operation. Pook 
has two grown children from a prior marriage, as well as a grown stepson. His 
22-year-old son David is a fledgling race driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook says the company is expecting an onslaught of criticism for the Transwest 
plan. "People resist change," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 There are already signs of resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto industry experts challenge Pook's contention that there's a desperate 
need for more automotive research and development, as evidenced by an 
increasing number of product recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the recalls are prompted by a desire to satisfy consumers in a highly 
competitive market, rather than by defective engineering, says Ronald A. 
Glantz, an industry analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, most manufacturers with design operations in Southern California, such 
as American Honda in Torrance, already have their own test tracks, though not 
in the immediate region. Honda has a double track in the Mojave Desert, with a 
variety of surfaces for testing prototypes. Isolated testing facilities make it 
easy to keep designs secret, said Kurt Antonius, Honda's senior manager for 
corporate public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook responds to such comments with smoldering conviction. The Long Beach 
track will offer full security for prototype testing, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Economists at Cal State Long Beach, are studying the Transwest plan. Based on 
the information planners have given them, said associate professor Peter 
Griffin, Pook's projections for new jobs and economic impact (about $175 
million a year after seven years) appear to be "within the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pook's immediate task is persuading the communities where Transwest will 
be located. 
</P>
<P>
 There has already been some grumbling about the noise and traffic that auto 
races would bring to the neighborhood, as well as some suspicions about Pook's 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that he wants to run four races a year there," says Bob 
Kolowes, president of the California Heights Neighborhood Assn. "But money has 
a way of changing people's minds." 
</P>
<P>
 But most residents and businesses near the 200-acre oil field and storage area 
consider the site an eyesore and have welcomed Pook's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 This, declares City Councilman Donelon, who represents the district where the 
project site is located, would be no ordinary "greasy racetrack." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not Chris' style," Donelon says.

GAS LEAK NEAR VENTURA KILLS 3 OIL WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three workers were killed and four others injured, two critically, after 
inhaling fumes from a hydrogen sulfide gas leak near an oil production plant 
north of Ventura on Wednesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12:07 p.m. gas leak occurred near Vintage Petroleum's plant just off U.S. 
101 as workers were in the process of redrilling an old oil well, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers were in a pit injecting water into a steel pipe to force oil to the 
surface, a standard drilling procedure, at the time of the accident, said Joe 
Luna, a Ventura County Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 When the men removed their nozzles, water started gushing out of the ground, 
releasing a small concentration of hydrogen sulfide fumes. The men were 
immediately overcome by the gas, which sent three of them into cardiac arrest, 
while the other four experienced respiratory problems, Luna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Fire Chief Dave Festerling said the colorless gas, a natural 
component of crude oil that smells like rotten eggs, can be absorbed so rapidly 
into the bloodstream that it sometimes can be fatal by the time a person smells 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the right concentration, you can be very dead in one breath," Festerling 
said, noting that the workers apparently had not been wearing gas masks. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters arriving at the scene used electronic sensors to measure the 
toxic fumes in the air, and found levels low enough to treat the injured 
workers at the scene, Luna said. Because the gas had quickly dissipated, there 
was no evacuation of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 One man was pronounced dead at the scene and two others died at Community 
Memorial Hospital in Ventura. Officials at the hospital said doctors worked on 
the two men for an hour, but that neither regained a pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead were identified as Sean David Harris, 26, of Oxnard, Jason Hoskins, 
22, of Ventura, and Ronald Johnson, 24, of Oxnard, who was pronounced dead at 
the scene. All worked for Pride Petroleum Services of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured workers were initially taken to Ventura County Medical Center, but 
two were transferred to Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo and two to Los 
Robles Medical Center in Thousand Oaks. Both hospitals are equipped with 
hyperbaric chambers, which deliver high doses of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 In critical condition late Wednesday were Jerry Walker, 41, of Bakersfield, 
and Toby Thrower, 55, of Oak View. Listed in fair condition were Derek Abbott, 
18, of Oak View, and Jeff Sandoval, 34, of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (hyperbaric) chambers are pressurized with 100% oxygen, which will 
detoxify all the inert gases in their tissue," said Dr. J. B. Wilmeth at Los 
Robles. 
</P>
<P>
 All the dead and injured workers were employees of independent contracting 
firms hired by Vintage Petroleum to do the drilling, officials said. Pride 
Petroleum and Schlumberger Well Services, also of Ventura, are the two 
independent contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors from Cal/OSHA were sent to the scene to investigate the 
circumstances of the leak, said John Duncan, a spokesman for the California 
Department of Industrial Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA, the state agency that oversees worker safety regulations, requires 
that firms drilling in areas known to contain toxic vapors conduct constant 
monitoring of the gases or chemicals, said Gene Glendenning, a Fresno-area 
manager for Cal/OSHA and an expert in oil safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Monitoring is usually done with electronic devices. The monitors sound an 
alarm before a dangerous concentration of gas is reached, Glendenning said. 
</P>
<P>
 The devices would be able to inform the companies if toxic concentrations are 
common and, consequently, if respiratory equipment is needed. Otherwise 
Cal/OSHA does not require respiratory equipment unless there has been a 
documented problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were in an area known to have hydrogen sulfide, they should have been 
monitoring the site," Glendenning said. "The firms are expected to do it. They 
are legally required to test that employees are not being overexposed." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear whether monitoring equipment was in use at the site. Paul 
Roden, a production foreman at Vintage Petroleum, said, "We're not positive of 
the cause" of the fatal incident. "It's still under investigation, " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning said hydrogen sulfide is dangerous because the smell disappears 
after a few seconds, but the gas remains. "People smell the rotten egg smell, 
then they think it's gone away, but it is growing in concentration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It paralyzes the respiratory system in higher concentrations, and breathing 
stops, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Refineries regularly remove hydrogen sulfide from oil, but sometimes it 
happens naturally, said Scott Lynn, a professor of chemical engineering at UC 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hydrogen sulfide is extremely toxic, comparable in toxicity to hydrogen 
cyanide," Lynn said. "But because you can smell it in low concentrations, you 
can often detect it early on." 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrogen sulfide fumes were blamed in 1991 for the death of a worker at a Los 
Angeles County paper recycling plant. Earlier this summer, Domtar Gypson Inc. 
agreed to pay $800,000 in fines as a result of that death at its plant in 
Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
 Diluted concentrations of the gas have been detected in recent months in the 
Los Angeles subway system. Transit and health officials have recommended 
sensors in the stations to give passengers an early warning if the levels 
become dangerous. Even at the low 9.9 p.p.m. detected in the subway, health 
officials said the gas could cause headaches, nausea and eye irritation.

CHANGE IS SLOW IN THERAPY GROUP FOR MEN WHO BATTER; COUNSELING: MANY 
RATIONALIZE THEIR VIOLENCE TO WOMEN. BUT IN A SERIES OF SESSIONS, SOME BREAK 
THE CYCLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first, counselor George Thomas lets newcomers such as Rick vent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some women like to be dominated," said Rick, a gum-chewing man in jeans who 
rammed his wife's head with his own until she bled. "Some women," he added as 
listeners nodded, "are prone to violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 18 men in the group were like Rick. A judge had ordered them to 
come to Thomas' domestic abuse prevention program every week for six months to 
a year or risk having a warrant issued for their arrest. They do not want to be 
there. They often think what they did was acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, Thomas cuts them off and starts to challenge their thinking. " 
'Prone to violence.' When I hear that, I ask: Who do you know who asks for 
physical pain? If you want to find out if a woman is into abuse, ask the women 
you know -- including your mother." 
</P>
<P>
 As the men progress to more advanced counseling groups, some undertake a 
painful examination of their behavior and their past and seek new ways to 
connect with women. But Thomas knows there are no guarantees. He estimates that 
his own success parallels national findings that half of those ordered into 
counseling drop out and only about half of those who finish the course stop 
beating their partners. 
</P>
<P>
 With the spotlight on O.J. Simpson, a man with a history of spousal abuse now 
accused of killing his ex-wife, more people are asking what causes domestic 
violence and what can be done about it. Experts continue to debate the causes 
of domestic violence, which the surgeon general has identified as the nation's 
single-largest cause of injury to women, and are working to distinguish 
different types of batterers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Thomas applies 20 years of experience as a lay counselor at the 
Southern California Counseling Center. His sessions in a brick-walled room of 
the center's basement offer a glimpse into the lives of batterers and the way 
they think. 
</P>
<P>
 His program is one of about 80 in Los Angeles that follow new state guidelines 
for the treatment of batterers. Those guidelines require counselors to insist 
that batterers accept total responsibility for their behavior, understand it is 
a matter of power and control, and learn new coping skills in long-term, group 
therapy programs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy. Thomas knows the emotional world these men come from is often 
overgrown and disconnected, a place where women count for little unless they 
are love objects. Then they matter more than almost anything. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Thomas sees it, batterers are not necessarily abusing the power 
society accords them. "The reality is all these men are very dependent on these 
women. . . . They come in believing women have the power. They sense they don't 
have control. When they act out is when they feel helpless and powerless." 
</P>
<P>
 His counseling is not about squelching feelings of anger or rage, he said. 
It's about changing the men's values and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a long-divorced nonconformist raised on the rough side of Detroit, was 
a 1960s activist when he came to work at the Southern California Counseling 
Center, an unusual facility that trains lay counselors to provide affordable 
mental health services to the community. Amid the grass-roots shelter movement 
for battered women in the 1970s and '80s, he said, he was challenged to provide 
services for the men. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman whose husband had slashed her throat in front of her kids called me 
up in 1986 and asked me what was I doing for batterers? I told her nothing. She 
told me if I wasn't part of the solution, I was part of the problem and hung 
up. I said, 'I'll show her.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, 51, patterned his program after the Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention 
Program, a model that is used by hundreds of communities nationwide, but he 
constantly revises it on the basis of his experience. He has tried to create a 
non-threatening environment in which the men will be confronted with their 
behavior, realize they are the problem and stay to become role models for other 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent Friday night class for new members, 18 men sat in a circle on 
sofas and chairs. The room was lined with handmade posters, such as those 
explaining the "Cycle of Violence" or the elements of "Power and Control." One 
chart outlined the group's regular agenda including a "check-in" of the 
previous week's violent incidents and "brags" about the men's successes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas applied the art of the question to newcomers who chuckled like 
schoolboys over their misdeeds. "I heard something about my girlfriend and I 
choked a little information out of her," one said to group laughter. Thomas 
asked evenly: "Did she think you were trying to kill her?" "Yeah," he replied, 
"I guess so." 
</P>
<P>
 Another said he pushed his wife around after he had been drinking. "So now I'm 
divorced. That's the best way," he shrugged to applause from the group. Thomas 
asked the man how long he had been married. "Twenty-one years," he said. "Four 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas asked some about their progress after the first eight weeks. Oscar, a 
scholarly looking man in wire-rimmed glasses, said he is learning to use the 
timeout technique, to stop and think when he feels his anger building. Before, 
when his wife got on his nerves, he said, he would have "hit the hell out of 
her." Now, he said, "Time-out flashes in my mind. I thank the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick said he is learning to control his anger a little and that week he had 
held back from thrashing his brother in an argument. But it is harder with his 
wife. He knows he is possessive. "Once we get started, it just doesn't end. I 
want to deal with it," he told Thomas. "I love her." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas generally passes over a longhaired, tattooed man in a muscle shirt 
whose negative generalizations about women are laced with expletives. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas told the men they will soon graduate into smaller groups in which they 
will be taught techniques to stop the escalation, and learn to recognize 
abusive patterns in their families. They might role play with Thomas, 
re-enacting abusive incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Thomas will teach some new skills: Call women by their names 
and don't generalize ("You won't punch Betty, but you'll punch a bitch"); take 
time to care for yourself; learn to express what you want verbally and develop 
a network of men to talk to in order to reduce emotional dependency on women 
("Women become their voices. Men believe they don't have to talk and women are 
socialized to speak for men.") 
</P>
<P>
 When the men ask why they batter, Thomas skims over root causes, saying they 
matter less than current behavior. Although alcohol or drugs are problems for 
about a third of the men, he assures them they remain responsible. Discussing 
childhood mistreatment is important only to understand adult problems, not to 
wallow in excuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas had little patience for a theory advanced by a man in one of his more 
advanced groups. John, a slight, fast-talking man who was convicted of hitting 
his wife, asked Thomas: "Aren't males born more aggressive? When I watch 
'National Geographic,' I see how it is with the male and female lions." 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't come from lions," the counselor replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he is sometimes angered by his clients' behavior, Thomas retains 
his compassion. "They don't have to be perfect. They don't have to be right," 
he said. What's important is that they "be willing to think and be open." 
</P>

 Experts disagree on the causes of spousal abuse, and what it means that 72% of 
men surveyed nationally are not violent in their marriages. Some say it proves 
abuse could not be the result of social conditioning; others say it proves it 
could not be a natural instinct. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause, researchers are learning that there are different types of 
batterers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Don Dutton, a psychologist and researcher at the University of 
British Columbia in Vancouver, 55% of battering men are stifled people who 
don't know how to express anger, which can erupt into violence in reaction to 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 20% have "borderline" personalities, a style defined by intensive 
anger in intimate relationships and mood swings described in the "Cycle of 
Violence" chart hanging in Thomas' basement -- increasing tension, a dramatic 
blowup, remorse and apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter, he said, are generally considered untreatable due to severe 
antisocial psychopathic tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers believe the different types of batterers may require different 
types of intervention; the problems of some men are too complex and deeply 
ingrained to be solved with a brief education in the cycles of violence and 
coping skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the victims of spousal abuse say the most serious problem with 
counseling programs is the false hopes they raise in victims that their 
partners will change, preventing them from making permanent plans to protect 
themselves. Some also worry that group sessions can devolve into negative male 
bonding. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts agree that counseling works only for men who have decided they want to 
change and are receptive to treatment. For some, the motivation is fear of 
jail; others fear losing their families or are fed up with their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most counseling programs are based on the belief that men can choose 
to be less violent. But to the men, it doesn't feel like a conscious choice, 
Dutton said. "This stuff has been jerking them around for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew, a muscular young man, told Thomas during a recent counseling session 
that he had attended therapy groups "from Saugus to Long Beach" in an attempt 
to conquer his problem and they all offered different advice. "I got to find 
out what makes me go off the wall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At "check-in," Andrew reported that he has become less physical with his wife 
since he began counseling, but his verbal abuse has escalated. When his wife 
decided to have lunch with an old boyfriend, he said, he started a name-calling 
fight that ended with the police being called to their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he suggested that if only she had not gone to lunch, none of it would 
have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the four other group members nodded with Thomas as he brought out 
the "Power and Control" chart. They had already been taught about their 
tendencies to blame, justify, deny and minimize. "What I'm talking about is 
denial. You got to be responsible for yourself," Thomas told Andrew. "Take a 
timeout. Call the 24-hour hot line." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew looked confused. "You guys are telling me I need to take a timeout? 
When? I'm with the kids. I can't talk 'til she's ready. She said one word that 
lit the candle. When could I have stopped it? When?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Scott, who has been in counseling six months and sometimes helps Thomas 
lead the sessions, said that when he feels that kind of rage, he starts to 
think of what's important. "My kids are important, but I'm important too." He 
said his home is peaceful now. "It took a lot of communicating and timeout. 
With other people too, not just her." 
</P>
<P>
 After class, Scott caught up with Andrew in the hall, telling him it was hard 
too for him in the beginning and not to be scared off. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, a 30-year-old unemployed sign technician, said he realized he had a 
problem during one argument with his wife when he heard his daughter say, "Just 
hit her." He did not want her to grow up thinking this was acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of them guys who said I'm not to blame," Scott said. "George 
(Thomas) got me. He said, 'What you're telling me is a bunch of B.S. How can it 
be her fault? If a big man like myself walks up to you and curses you out, do 
you hit me? No. Why when this little woman curses you out, do you hit her?' I 
got to think about that." 
</P>
<P>
 At the next weekly meeting, Andrew returned and reported at check-in: "My wife 
and I are doing good. . . . Too well. I'm waiting for something to happen. A 
lot of times we reach a level where there's nothing to kiss and make up for. 
It's like, now what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas suggested Andrew and his wife make a contract to spend five minutes 
talking over their feelings when the tension inevitably starts to build again. 
If one or the other can't do it, they owe the person a dinner or a back rub, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel, a convicted wife-beater with a slow and lilting Caribbean accent, 
bragged that he has put the idea of equality into practice in his relationship. 
"My life is wonderful. I don't have no problems. For the rest of my life I'm 
going to be equal to my partner." 
</P>
<P>
 To the scorn and fascination of other group members, Daniel reported how he 
now does housework voluntarily, cleaning the bathroom, doing dishes and 
shopping for groceries. "If I hear the baby cry, I get up and feed her." 
</P>
<P>
 One listener said, "If a friend came by and saw me doing housework and my wife 
kicking back, I'd be embarrassed. . . . My mom would say, 'Hey, you don't have 
to do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Another said his friends would call him a wimp. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel just laughed. "In the night when you need some loving, who are you 
going to go to? Your friends or your wife?"

 While watching anti-abortion demonstrators wave crucifixes and ministers plead 
aloud for the lives of "the little ones" at an Indiana medical clinic last 
week, Ann Horn kept an eye out for several familiar figures she hoped not to 
meet again. 
</P>
<P>
 An organizer of volunteer escorts for patients and doctors at the Women's 
Health Organization clinic here, Horn found herself reliving old, unnerving 
encounters in the aftermath of the recent slayings of a Pensacola, Fla., 
abortion doctor and his escort. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn's first brush came several years ago when a fervent abortion foe 
approached her as she walked to her car after a protest. Spewing insults, the 
man threatened to molest her. The second encounter involved a drifter known to 
show up at anti-abortion rallies clad in camouflage fatigues and wearing a 
hunting knife. During one demonstration, the man fingered his blade and grinned 
at her. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of these days," he told her, "I'm going to cut your hands off." 
</P>
<P>
 The murders last month of 74-year-old clinic escort James H. Barrett and Dr. 
John Bayard Britton have made such incidents chillingly real again for many 
abortion rights activists. Barrett's murder -- the first of an abortion rights 
volunteer -- widens the threat of violence previously faced primarily by 
physicians, confronting thousands of clinic escorts with the realization that 
their social activism may come at a dangerous price. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each death casts the net a little wider," said Horn, 40, a spiky-haired 
veteran of abortion demonstrations since 1978. "First it was doctors. Now, it's 
us. You begin to realize how vulnerable you are just because of what you 
believe in." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1970s, escorts have emerged as crucial linchpins in national 
abortion defense strategy, first used to accompany patients into clinics past 
jostling protesters and, in the past year, to shield clinic doctors marked for 
harassment and, perhaps, assassination. Unarmed and trained in civil resistance 
techniques honed during the Civil Rights Era, escorts are most often young 
feminists but can be elderly and male, like Barrett, a retired Air Force 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 They are trained to take abuse. They also dish it out. They match each 
anti-abortion placard with an abortion rights poster of their own, howl out 
songs to drown out their opposition's chants, and videotape and photograph 
their foes even as they too are being caught on camera. Many are targeted for 
harassment not only during protests but also at their homes, in supermarkets 
and in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be open season on us, but we're not going away," said Nancy Michael, 
48, who regularly escorts abortion doctor U. George Klopfer to his clinic in 
South Bend, Ind. "There's a lot of young women -- a lot of poor women -- whose 
lives would be in utter chaos if it weren't for escorts." 
</P>
<P>
 Escorts say that despite their quickening fears, they will not be intimidated 
from escorting doctors and patients into clinics. Last week, abortion rights 
supporters from around the Southeast arrived to staff Pensacola's beleaguered 
clinic. One Georgia abortion clinic shut down temporarily to allow its workers 
to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people are volunteering for clinic defense and escort service than ever 
before," said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, 
which has trained more than 32,000 clinic volunteers since the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-abortion activists counter that abortion rights leaders are exploiting 
the deaths in Pensacola to sully the entire opposition. "They are using a few 
vigilantes as an excuse to go after all of us," said Flip Benham, national 
director of Operation Rescue. "When we're on the streets, there's safety. They 
know we're governed by the gospel of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the determination of abortion rights forces to carry on, Barrett's 
death poses new difficulties for their movement even as it has prodded the 
Clinton Administration to dispatch federal marshals to protect clinics in 
Pensacola, Ft. Wayne and eight other hotbeds of anti-abortion sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 After feminist groups sent 20 bulletproof vests to Pensacola's clinic 
volunteers last week and ordered trained clinic defense organizers to other 
anti-abortion strongholds, some leaders acknowledged there is not much else 
they can do to protect the lives of their escorts. For now, abortion rights 
lobbyists plan to urge Congress to allow escorts to sue people who harass them, 
a right already granted doctors under an existing clinic protection law. 
</P>
<P>
 And while clinic defense strategists have begun talking about altering their 
tactics to confront the possibility of violence aimed specifically at escorts, 
they say they have no intention of pulling back student volunteers -- sometimes 
as young as high school age -- as patient escorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are telling people to look realistically at the dangers," said Katherine 
Spillar, national coordinator for the Feminist Majority Foundation's clinic 
defense project. 
</P>
<P>
 After 16 years working as a volunteer in Ft. Wayne, Ann Horn steels herself 
with realism. Like many escorts, she has learned to take what she considers 
reasonable precautions. She carries a camera with her constantly. On protest 
days, she often borrows a car owned by the clinic so opponents cannot identify 
her private vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a bright red sports car. It's a dead giveaway," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Horn woke up one morning to find two radical anti-abortion 
activists from Missouri camped on the street outside her rural house. They left 
after she confronted them, but then Horn discovered that the clinic car she had 
borrowed had been rifled. She filed a report with the sheriff and installed a 
motion-detector floodlight above her garage. 
</P>
<P>
 On sabbatical from a job as manager of a meeting hall, Horn volunteers once a 
week at the Ft. Wayne clinic -- usually on "procedure day," when patients file 
in for abortions and when demonstrations are most likely to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been a volunteer in Ft. Wayne since 1978, about the time the National 
Organization for Women and other national feminist groups began 
institutionalizing the concept of using escorts to chaperon patients through 
angry crowds and defend clinics from paralyzing abortion protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Horn had only given money to the cause. But after friends 
persuaded her to work as an escort during one Sunday protest, she recalls, she 
was angered to hear anti-abortion demonstrators call clinic defenders "baby 
killers." Then, a protester pulled her aside and whispered: "I hope I catch you 
in a dark alley." 
</P>
<P>
 "From that moment, I was on board," Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Escorts were first used as what Smeal calls "friendly faces" -- sympathetic 
feminists who steered abortion patients into clinics. But training changed as 
abortion protests grew more tense in the early 1980s, which were often 
dominated by aggressive nonviolent protest techniques that used the power of 
crowds to overwhelm clinic defenders and frustrate police. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of the escort became to "provide confidentiality and get patients and 
clinic workers in without harassment," said Jeanne Clark, a veteran escort 
organizer. Trained in daylong sessions, for example, escorts learned how to use 
their bodies and placards to shield patients from persistent "sidewalk 
counselors" and other demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the murder of Dr. David Gunn in Pensacola -- the first of an abortion 
doctor -- was a turning point for escorts. Clinic directors began asking 
volunteers to accompany physicians during protests. These nerve-racking 
assignments have evolved into elaborate cat-and-mouse games replete with rented 
cars, ever-changing highway routes and motel reservations made under assumed 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Erwin, a 48-year-old volunteer who escorts abortion doctors to a 
besieged clinic in Melbourne, Fla., feels "humiliated" each time she drives to 
work. The doctor she escorts lies in the back seat, stuffed into a bullet-proof 
vest and hidden under a sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is insanity," Erwin said. "I have to smuggle him (into the clinic) like 
he's a bank robber or a murderer." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran escorts and volunteers all have stories of being shadowed by 
protesters, confronted in restaurants, harangued as they shop. South Bend, 
Ind., clinic escorts Nancy Michael and Jill Chambers looked up from Michael's 
kitchen table one day last spring to see themselves being photographed from a 
van parked outside. The women tried to tail the van in Michael's car, but they 
lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nerve of those people," Michael said. "It's like they just want you to 
know they're watching, like they have the power to get you or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran escorts acknowledge that they too are often caught up in the war of 
nerves but insist that they steer clear of harassing their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Horn spent much of her "procedure day" last week snapping photographs of 
Operation Rescue activists -- from meek ministers to hulking provocateurs in 
tank tops. Horn cheerily told of driving past a Northern Indiana Rescue prayer 
service the night before to videotape suspected radical anti-abortion 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn was lucky last week. None of her old foes showed. Instead, she spent 
seven hours watching activists carry photographs of dead fetuses, hoist 
crucified rubber baby dolls and listen to Benham's anti-abortion sermon across 
the street from the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Darla McMillan, a housewife opposed to abortion, stood near the clinic and 
offered prayers for patients who rushed past her and the escorts who opposed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand here by myself a lot and pray that God will open their eyes," 
McMillan said. "We don't hate them. They don't understand us because they don't 
understand the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-edged give-and-take between escorts and protesters often leaves 
police in the middle. Activists on both sides have a keen understanding of how 
far they can go without breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating for the people who are targeted," said Sgt. Judy Bradshaw, a 
police spokeswoman in Des Moines, Iowa, where U.S. marshals have been 
dispatched. "They want action right then and there, but the perpetrators know 
exactly what they can get away with without breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion rights leaders hope to break the stalemate by broadening the legal 
rights of volunteer escorts. The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, 
signed by President Clinton this year, gave abortion rights leaders a new legal 
tool to thwart harassment. The law, known as FACE, set criminal penalties for 
harassment during anti-abortion demonstrations and gave doctors, health workers 
and patients the right to seek civil suits if they are intimidated while 
providing or receiving abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 But escorts and other volunteers are not eligible to seek civil remedies, 
which feminist leaders hope to address when Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), 
the bill's original sponsor, holds hearings on whether to amend FACE in coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see escorts with the same protection that doctors have," said 
Susan Hill, national director of the Women's Health Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, feminist leaders talk of amending escort training to emphasize the 
possibility of violence. "People need to know exactly what they face when they 
go out on the line," said Nancy Kohsin-Kintigh, an organizer with the Feminist 
Majority's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 They are still scrambling, though, to sort out the new realities wrought by 
James Barrett's death. Despite the recent violence, abortion rights leaders 
defend the occasional use of student escorts during tense protests. Activists 
say that many students volunteer with their parents but admit that some 
teen-agers come on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each teen-ager will have to make their own assessment," said Spillar. 
"Hopefully, they have the emotional maturity to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Most physician escorts are middle-age and older veterans like Barrett and his 
wife, June, 68, who was injured in Pensacola -- committed and willing to risk 
violence in order to protect abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, while Ann Horn supervised patient escorts outside the Ft. Wayne 
clinic, four physician escorts in blue shirts quietly followed Dr. Klopfer as 
he whisked into his office past raucous demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
 The four had left South Bend earlier that morning in a clinic car that trailed 
Klopfer's battered Mercedes "just in case," said escort Roger Snow. Armed with 
a video camera and a cellular phone, they were unarmed, but "we could at least 
act as witnesses," Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive, the escorts talked about the prospect of violence. But the trip 
was uneventful -- at least until they reached Ft. Wayne. A few blocks from the 
clinic, Klopfer's car broke down. The muffler had torn loose. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pounding rainstorm, two escorts helped Klopfer refasten the muffler with 
duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the doctor was safely inside, the escorts milled in front of the clinic, 
visibly relieved, ignoring the crowd that roiled around them. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a few moments there, we were wondering, you know, if there was sabotage 
or something," Snow said. "But when nobody showed up to harass us, we figured, 
well, it's just his old car. At least I hope it was."

U.S. TO BLOCK ANY REPEAT OF CUBAN BOAT LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE and MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is prepared to virtually blockade the 90-mile-wide 
strait between Florida and Cuba if Cuban President Fidel Castro launches a 
repeat of the 1980 Mariel boat lift, in which he sent thousands of Cubans to 
America's shores. 
</P>
<P>
 Key Administration officials said the effort would involve dozens of Coast 
Guard vessels, from relatively small surfboats to cutters of 100 feet or more, 
aided by Coast Guard and Navy surveillance aircraft. The Coast Guard already 
has moved additional ships into the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the major thrust of the operation would be aimed at keeping 
Cuban Americans who live in South Florida from sailing for Cuba to try to pick 
up any refugees who might be en route to American shores -- a factor that 
proved a major problem in the 1980 incursion. 
</P>
<P>
 The contingency plan, drafted in 1981 after the Mariel boat lift, has been 
kept on the shelf pending a second Castro-spawned flight from Cuba. U.S. 
officials have been reluctant to talk about the four-inch-thick document for 
fear of encouraging Castro to order a new exodus; many think he duped the 
United States the last time, in part, by sending throngs of Cuba's undesirables 
to America's shores. 
</P>
<P>
 But while stressing that no such plan has been put into effect yet, State 
Department spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters Wednesday that "there is 
contingency planning . . . under way," and other officials sketched the plan's 
broad outlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves came as U.S. officials released 25 of 26 people who were recovered 
Tuesday from a Cuban government vessel that Havana had claimed had been 
hijacked by refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The vessel, a green-hulled, 50-foot concrete boat, was intercepted by the 
Coast Guard 35 miles north of Cuba late Tuesday afternoon and escorted to Key 
West, Fla., where it tied up at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday. Justice Department 
officials began interviewing those on board then. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was a young man in military fatigues. Refugees told Coast Guard 
officers he was a Cuban border patrol guard who engineered the hijacking, then 
stopped to pick up relatives near Mariel. 
</P>
<P>
 The individual who was detained was identified as Leonel Macias Gonzalez. 
Justice Department officials declined to say whether Gonzalez is the alleged 
mastermind of the hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Fraga, director of the Cuban Interests Section, which represents Cuba 
in Washington in the absence of full diplomatic ties with the United States, 
had said Tuesday that a Cuban navy lieutenant was killed in the hijacking. The 
refugees said shots had been fired but no one had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Fraga backed away from his assertion but continued to criticize 
the United States for a Cuba policy designed to "foment disturbances that 
(could) lead to a blood bath in my country." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials said the stories of the two sides conflicted so 
sharply that they had been unable to tell whether the boat really was stolen 
and whether the hijackers had killed the navy lieutenant, as the Cuban 
government had alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a yellow biplane rigged as a crop duster landed in Marathon, in the 
Florida Keys, with 14 Cuban defectors aboard. A spokeswoman for the local 
sheriff's office said the pilot worked as a crop duster and those aboard were 
all his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Coast Guard reported that it had picked up 116 Cubans in the 
Florida Strait. That brought to almost 5,300 the number of Cuban emigres who 
have sailed to the United States this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration still has not decided what to do about the latest 
incidents. Washington is eager to see Castro overthrown but would prefer that 
any such transition be smooth and not spawn an exodus of Cubans to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has no formal treaties with Cuba governing hijackings by air 
or sea and, therefore, has no obligation to punish or return refugees who land 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Key Administration officials have met privately with leaders of South 
Florida's Cuban American community to urge them to keep calm and "not play into 
Castro's hands" during the current uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami City Manager Cesar H. Odio said local officials have reviewed emergency 
plans. Federal agents have been visiting Miami-area marinas, watching for 
indications that boat owners might be preparing for trips to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariel boat lift sent 125,000 Cubans to Florida's shores over a five-month 
period; the group included sizable populations of criminals and the mentally 
ill.

REP. TUCKER TO BE INDICTED, SOURCES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Walter R. Tucker III, a charismatic and controversial congressman who was 
the youngest person ever elected mayor of Compton, is expected to be indicted 
today on 10 counts of violating federal bribery and income tax laws, sources 
close to the case said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those sources, the counts against Tucker include eight violations 
of the Hobbs Act, the 1951 federal law that makes it a crime for public 
officials to solicit or accept bribes. Tucker, the sources added, also is 
expected to face two counts of violating federal income tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
 All income -- whether legally or illegally earned -- is subject to federal 
taxes. Failure to report income derived from bribes is a federal offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., the Los Angeles attorney whose clients include 
entertainer Michael Jackson and O.J. Simpson, is representing Tucker. Tucker 
has consistently declined to discuss the case, referring all calls to Cochran. 
Cochran was unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If returned as expected, the multi-count indictment would conclude at least 
one phase of a sweeping federal investigation into Compton city affairs. Tucker 
and former Councilwoman Patricia Moore were among the targets of the undercover 
FBI inquiry, which has been under way for more than two years and has been 
operated out of the FBI's Long Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, an FBI agent posed as a businessman and offered 
officials bribes to have items placed on Compton City Council agendas, among 
other things. The agent met with officials to offer those bribes, and at least 
some of the meetings were secretly videotaped, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Nora Manella said she could not discuss the case or the possibility 
of indictments. She confirmed that she expects to hold a 2 p.m. news conference 
today, but would not disclose its topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't confirm or deny any reports of anticipated indictments," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the investigation surfaced in March, when The Times and the Wall 
Street Journal published details of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who has publicly feuded with Tucker in the past, is not expected to be 
indicted today, and sources would not say whether she is cooperating with 
authorities. Sources added that the investigation is ongoing, and said other 
officials still could be targeted. Moore could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In such an investigation, it is pretty common that things continue to unfold 
and leads continue to unfold," one federal law enforcement source said. "It's 
not like a bank robbery where you catch the guy and it is over. Nor is it even 
like a savings and loan failure where it is pretty clear that there is a 
certain number of people involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover phase of the federal investigation was followed by an extensive 
search of Compton city records. In April, virtually every major city department 
-- the city manager, city attorney, treasurer and grants manager, as well as 
the Community Redevelopment Authority and the personnel, police, public works 
and planning departments -- was served with subpoenas for records. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors also served subpoenas seeking campaign disclosure 
statements for Tucker and Moore, and possibly other politicians, from 1985 to 
the present, sources said in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal investigation of Tucker is not the first time that the Baptist 
minister has found himself embroiled in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Tucker, then a deputy district attorney, was fired from his post with 
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. He later pleaded no contest 
to misdemeanor charges in a case where he was accused of altering an official 
document and lying to a judge about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker rebounded from that setback and launched his political career. In 
April, 1991, he followed in his father's footsteps as mayor of Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 He held that post for less than two years. In November, 1992, he was elected 
to Congress from the 37th District, beating out the daughter and heir-apparent 
of Rep. Melvin Dymally in a campaign considered one of the most heated ever in 
Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker's career and Compton's fierce political environment have left the 
congressman with loyal allies and determined critics. As news spread late 
Wednesday of the pending indictment, officials were reluctant to comment at 
length, saying they preferred to wait for official news about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jane D. Robbins, an 18-year veteran of Compton's ruling body, 
returned from vacation Wednesday and said she had not been officially told of 
any action against her former council colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was trying to do a good job (as mayor)," Robbins said. "But he was 
young and inexperienced and trying to follow in his father's footsteps and that 
doesn't always happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins added that just before going on vacation 10 days ago, federal 
authorities asked her to testify before the grand jury considering the case. 
She said she did not because of her plans to leave town. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Omar Bradley, who succeeded Tucker in that post, could not be reached 
Wednesday evening. Associates said he was busy meeting with other city 
officials to chart Compton's response to its latest public relations flare-up 
-- the videotaped beating of a teen-age ,suspect by a Compton police officer.

AARP BACKS DEMOCRATIC HEALTH BILLS; REFORM: SUPPORT BY THE BOARD OF HUGE SENIOR 
CITIZENS GROUP REPRESENTS MAJOR BOOST FOR MITCHELL, GEPHARDT PROPOSALS. AMA 
LEADERS, BUSINESS FACTIONS OPPOSE SENATOR'S PLAN. 
</P>

<P>
 Major organizations with deeply held interests in the health care debate began 
choosing sides Wednesday on the Senate leadership's reform legislation, led by 
the influential American Assn. of Retired Persons, which ended months of 
neutrality by endorsing the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The AARP board of directors said that it will urge the organization's 33 
million members nationwide to support the bill put together by Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), as well as House legislation shaped by 
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). The two bills differ in key 
details but both have been embraced by President Clinton, who says that either 
would meet his goal of eventually achieving universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "My bottom line is what it has always been. We have to have a system that over 
a period of time will lead to universal coverage," Clinton said in a meeting 
with reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours after the AARP's endorsement was announced, the American Medical 
Assn. board, meeting in Chicago, voted to declare its "nonsupport" for the 
Senate bill and a number of business organizations led by three of the nation's 
most powerful business groups, disclosed that they may form an umbrella 
alliance to fight the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The special interest jockeying reflected the realization that after more than 
a year of public debate over health care reform, the issue is nearing final 
action. "We have been waiting a long time for this to happen," said AARP 
President Eugene Lehrmann, speaking for the organization's board. "Now is the 
time for us to strike." 
</P>
<P>
 "Although neither bill is perfect, we conclude that these bills provide the 
foundation for comprehensive health care for all Americans," he said. "If 
either bill is defeated, health care reform will be dead for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization plans to buy newspaper ads and to activate itsnational 
network of 250,000 volunteers to lobby for the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing its opposition to Mitchell's bill, the AMA board, representing 
the nation's largest doctors organization, also disclosed that it is backing a 
bipartisan bill in the House that increasingly looms as an alternative to 
Gephardt's proposal and seeks far more modest reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The AMA's endorsement of the bill written by Reps. J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.) and 
Michael Bilirakis (R-Fla.) -- which has 74 sponsors, 37 from each party -- came 
even as the two men are about to join forces with a somewhat smaller, but 
like-minded, bipartisan group of House colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, Rowland and Bilirakis have been negotiating privately with Reps. 
Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) and Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) in hopes of forming a broad 
alliance. Cooper and Grandy's bill has 57 co-sponsors from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a proposal introduced in the Senate late Tuesday night by Minority Leader 
Bob Dole of Kansas, the emerging bipartisan House bill does not guarantee 
coverage to the 39 million uninsured Americans. Rather, it would rely on 
incremental reforms, such as banning discriminatory practices to enable 
consumers to take their insurance from job to job and to buy affordable 
policies even if they or their family members have existing illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem with the evolving bipartisan plan is that it is currently 
projected to attain only about 90% coverage -- a potential obstacle to gaining 
broader support, Grandy conceded Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, AMA board chairman P. John Seward, a Rockford, Ill., physician, said 
in a telephone interview that the Rowland-Bilirakis and Cooper-Grandy approach 
"offers the best and most realistic chance in the House for comprehensive 
health care reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Further ominous news for Clinton and his congressional allies surfaced 
Wednesday when the National Federation of Independent Business, which has waged 
a highly effective campaign against mandatory workplace-based insurance, 
disclosed that it is discussing with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National 
Assn. of Manufacturers and other business groups the formation of an alliance 
to fight Mitchell's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 As special interests chose sides, senators spent a good part of the afternoon 
of their second day of debate discussing whether to slow down the pace of 
deliberations, with Republicans demanding more time to study Mitchell's bill 
and Democrats resisting such demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, as expected, the Senate handily defeated an amendment by 
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to put off the issue until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The House is to begin debating health care reform next week.

ELEVENTH-HOUR BASEBALL NEGOTIATIONS STRIKE OUT; SPORTS: BOTH SIDES DOUBT THAT 
SALARY-CAP COMPROMISE WILL EMERGE IN TIME TO AVERT PLAYERS' WALKOUT ON FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Major league baseball's eighth work stoppage since 1972 is virtually certain 
to begin Friday as negotiators for the owners and the players ended Wednesday's 
negotiating session having made no progress and with no plans to meet today. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure to come to any kind of agreement seriously threatens the final 52 
days of the regular season, plus the playoffs and World Series. The players 
plan to go on strike Friday, meaning that eight of the 28 teams, including the 
Angels, may have played their final game of the season on Wednesday. The 
remaining 20 teams, including the Dodgers, will stop playing after today's 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 A 2 1/2-hour meeting here Wednesday failed to produce any progress in the 
stalemated negotiations for a collective-bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, made reference to players union 
counterpart Donald Fehr after Wednesday's meeting when he said: "I continue to 
hope, as Don said in our meeting, that lightning will strike in the next day 
and a half and one of us will get an idea allowing us to bridge this gap, but 
I'm not optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret that the union has not recognized the problems of the industry and 
responded to our proposal in any way, shape or form. I regret the union's 
decision to strike, which not only hurts the owners and players themselves, 
but, more significantly, the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 One such fan, dressed as a clown, stood at the corner of 49th Street and 
Lexington Avenue in mid-town Manhattan on Wednesday and distributed 
heart-shaped balloons to anyone who asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a baseball fan," the man said, "and I'm handing these out as my way of 
telling people that neither the players nor owners have any heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Most fans may not need that reminder. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the owners' attempt to overhaul a pay system that has seen the 
average major league salary go from $146,500 a year in 1980 to $1.2 million 
today. The owners say this threatens the economic viability of many of the 28 
clubs. They say 12 to 14 of the clubs will lose money this year, down from a 
previous estimate of 19 to 21 clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners also claim that a payroll gap between clubs threatens the 
competitive balance of the leagues. For example, the San Diego Padres have a 
payroll of $15.5 million, while the Atlanta Braves are spending $52.1 million 
on player salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have responded with a proposal that would place a cap on salaries, 
eliminate salary arbitration as a method for settling contract differences and 
reduce the eligibility requirement for free agency from six years of major 
league service to four years. A player's current ballclub would then have the 
right of first refusal for a player with five-to-six years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners' proposal does not specify an exact salary cap, but it calls for 
50% of all revenue to be shared with the players. The players currently get 
58%. The proposal also guarantees that the players get at least $1 billion a 
year for all player costs (salaries, pensions, health benefits, etc.) as long 
as club revenues don't fall below the 1994 level. 
</P>
<P>
 If revenues grow at 7% per year, the average salary of a major league player 
would be $2.6 million in seven years, when the proposed contract would expire. 
Revenues have grown at an average rate of 14% over the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch has also persuaded teams in larger markets to share a portion of their 
revenue with teams in smaller markets. However, this would only happen if there 
were a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr says the union will never accept a cap and is prepared to fight for as 
long as it takes. He disputes the owners' contention that they are in economic 
trouble, citing revenue of $1.8 billion a year and this year's projected 
attendance of 70 million people (if a walkout is avoided). 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr says a salary cap would place an artificial restriction on salaries, 
transfer billions of dollars from the players to the owners and destroy free 
agency because many clubs would be too close to the cap to bid for high-priced 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 He also says it would damage the competitive balance of teams because many 
player-related decisions would be made by accountants rather than general 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a fight of the players' making," Fehr said. "It's strictly an 
internal dispute among owners who couldn't agree on how to sort out $1.8 
billion in revenue without forcing the players to accept a salary cap by which 
the players would pay back the big-market clubs (for increasing the amount of 
revenue they share with the small markets). If there are revenue problems, the 
owners need to address the possibility of bad management and rewrite their own 
rules without asking the players for a pay-back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a terrible shame the owners put the players in this position by waiting 
18 months to make a proposal they knew we wouldn't accept, but they have us 
right where they wanted us." 
</P>
<P>
 The previous labor agreement expired in December. The owners had voted to 
reopen the negotiations a year earlier but did not make a proposal for 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The union cites that delay, along with the owners' recent refusal to make a 
$7.8-million pension plan contribution from All-Star Game receipts, as evidence 
of the owners' intention to force a strike. The owners said they weren't 
required to make the contribution because there was no bargaining agreement in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 The union also claims that a strike is its only leverage against the 
possibility of the owners declaring an impasse in October and unilaterally 
implementing a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The players will not be paid during a strike, collectively losing about $5 
million a day in salaries. However, they have a $175-million-to-$200-million 
strike fund from licensing revenues and will distribute the first checks on 
Sept. 15 and Sept. 29, the usual paydays for the players. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have $140 million in TV revenue at stake during the postseason and 
anticipate some of their biggest attendance dates during the final days of the 
season, when teams are trying to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 They have no strike insurance, as they did during the 50-day strike of 1981 
(which ended when the insurance ran out), but they have a $260-million line of 
credit from a bank consortium, providing "short-term relief for any club with a 
cash-flow problem," Ravitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is generally agreed that the players won all seven of the previous work 
stoppages -- four strikes and three lockouts -- by outlasting the 
often-splintered owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball has been without a commissioner for 23 months because the owners do 
not want a commissioner interfering in labor negotiations as they believe Fay 
Vincent did in ending the lockout of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the belief that many of the large-market clubs have no interest in a 
prolonged work stoppage and could live with the status quo, Ravitch says it 
would be a mistake for the union to underestimate the owners' resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, because of a recent rule change by the owners, it will require 21 
of the 28 clubs -- rather than a simple majority -- to approve an agreement in 
the event of a work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 That means eight of the hard-line small-market teams could hold up any 
settlement that does not include a salary cap. Some owners have said that even 
the 1995 season could be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen so much (economic) distress and despair among the clubs," 
said interim commissioner Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers. "For too 
many years we put off addressing the problems until tomorrow, figuring they'd 
disappear, just go away. We now know otherwise. We now know tomorrow is here 
and something has to be done. The future of the game is at stake."

PUSH FOR COST CONTROLS ON HEALTH TAKES A BACK SEAT; DEBATE: ISSUE IS RECEDING 
BECAUSE OF POLITICAL PRESSURE, NEGATIVE CONNOTATION. FOCUS SHIFTS TO UNIVERSAL 
COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Senate launched its long-awaited health care debate this week, Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) declared that the American health care system 
is mired in "a crisis of affordability and price." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, ironically, the issue of containing health care costs has receded into 
the background of the discussion, almost drowned out by the far louder argument 
over universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, President Clinton and his allies have argued that universal 
coverage and cost containment are the interlocking parts of the health reform 
jigsaw puzzle. As long as large numbers of people remain uninsured, the costs 
of their treatment will continue to be paid indirectly by those who have 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prospects for achieving universal coverage in the near future look 
increasingly bleak. And as congressional leaders struggle to hold the line in 
that arena, they are being forced to make concessions that erode 
cost-containment efforts in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost was the issue that got the entire health care debate going. America now 
spends 14% of its gross domestic product on medical care, a far greater share 
than any other country. As costs have soared, workers with coverage have been 
forced to forgo wage increases to pay for them and the consequences of being 
uninsured have grown to sometimes tragic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's original approach to reining in costs, which included a form 
of government cost controls, was rejected early on by Congress. But the 
proposals that have replaced it in the major alternatives now before both 
houses are far from certain to do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the shift in emphasis, said Brookings Institution analyst Henry 
Aaron, is as simple as this: "Universal coverage brings joy. Cost containment 
inflicts pain." 
</P>
<P>
 "Politically, there is absolutely no mileage in cost control," agreed Uwe 
Reinhardt, a health expert at Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional leaders have inserted provisions in both plans that actually 
could undermine some of the cost restraint that already is going on in the 
health care market today. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the one hand, they're saying we can't have price controls. On the other, 
they're removing the ability of the market to control costs. . . . Most 
proposals have really been at cross purposes," said Bill Custer, research 
director of the Employee Benefits Research Institute, a private, nonprofit 
public policy research organization in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he said, the legislation that Congress ultimately produces -- if, 
in fact, it produces any -- might actually make health spending increase faster 
than it otherwise would have because more people would be using the system 
without any incentive to decrease costs. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as this week, when an ABC News poll asked which was the more 
important goal of health reform, 49% said it was holding down costs, edging out 
the 45% who chose insurance for all. But while bringing down health care costs 
sounds good in principle, actually doing it is another matter entirely. That is 
because: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cost containment almost certainly means limiting consumer choice. Health 
maintenance organizations, for instance, have managed to bring down their costs 
by limiting the network of doctors and hospitals with which they do business. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the House Democratic leadership bill undercuts their ability to do 
that with the "any willing provider" provision, which requires networks to 
admit any qualified physician who is willing to accept their rates. Both bills 
also offer what critics consider overly broad definitions of the "essential 
community providers," such as hospitals, clinics and medical professionals, 
with which the networks are required to contract. Moreover, the bills require 
companies to offer their workers at least one plan with unlimited choice of 
doctors, an option that is generally more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 * The urgency has faded as the increase in health premium prices has slowed 
from double-digit levels in the late-1980s to single-digit figures now. In some 
areas, premiums are even going down. But some analysts say that health 
inflation could easily reignite, once the threat of restrictive legislation is 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most consumers are insulated somewhat from the true cost of their care 
because their employers pay all or part of their premiums. Proposals to shift 
more of the true cost to the actual users of medical care -- by making health 
premiums part of their taxable income, for instance -- have been dropped by 
congressional committees in the face of stiff opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cutting costs means curbing the earnings of doctors, hospitals, drug 
companies and medical technology firms -- all of whom employ powerful lobbies 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 As the realities of politics have taken the health care debate away from cost 
containment, no one is more dismayed than the leaders of the nation's biggest 
businesses. Their concerns over paying the skyrocketing health costs of their 
workers were a major impetus for embarking on the health reform effort. General 
Motors often notes, for instance, that it spends more on health insurance than 
it does on steel. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, "we could come out with legislation that could put us in worse shape than 
when we came in, in terms of costs," said Michael J. Rourke, senior vice 
president of the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. Inc., which owns the A&P 
Supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief executive of one of the nation's largest corporations said that he 
is rethinking his support for the President's health reform effort, because it 
is beginning to appear that no bill at all would be preferable. As things stand 
now, he said, he fears that Congress will pass legislation that perpetuates a 
system in which large companies continue to carry an undue share of an 
ever-increasing burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly, this is what scared me to death from day one and what scared all of 
us at this company, that this is exactly what would happen," said the CEO, who 
spoke on condition that he not be identified by name. "This is the only way 
that we could have been hurt by this bill. It's a shame that all of us who 
provide good health care are going to get clobbered again." 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, there are only two ways of curbing health spending and neither is 
foolproof. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is to have the government do it. That was an element of what Clinton 
proposed, when he suggested limiting the growth of health premiums. A somewhat 
weaker version of the same approach is in the bill being offered by House 
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), which will be the center of debate 
in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Gephardt's plan, if health spending in any state grew faster than other 
costs, a system of fee limits similar to those of the Medicare system would go 
into effect in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 But any system of government-imposed cost controls raises the fears of 
rationing and a deterioration of quality. Moreover, history has never shown 
them to work over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Republicans and many Democrats argue instead for the second 
route, which is more a leap of faith: relying on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every proposal before Congress includes provisions to make the 
market work better. Almost every one calls for the establishment of voluntary 
purchasing cooperatives, through which individuals and small firms could pool 
their purchasing power. They also aim to give consumers more information about 
providers, so they can comparison-shop for medical care the way they do for 
other purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mitchell plan takes this more market-oriented tack, adding a 25% tax on 
the premiums of plans that grow faster than a target based on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the major health proposals include cuts in Medicare, which 
already pays only part of the costs of the services it covers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Already large employers are getting costs shifted from Medicare," said 
Southern California Edison Co. Vice President Margaret Jordan. "That's not 
going to help cost containment. That's just more cost shifting."

ARGENTINE JEWS START RECOVERY FROM TRAGEDY 
</P>

<P>
 It is with pain that 92-year-old Samuel Rollansky thinks of rebuilding. The 
bomb that ripped through the heart of Argentina's Jewish community not only 
killed almost 100 people -- it also destroyed Rollansky's lifework, one of the 
world's most precious collections of Jewish historical books and papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Jews, we are accustomed to having to start over," he said quietly, 
cradling a volume of "Master Works of Yiddish Literature," which he published 
more than 30 years ago. "It is an obligation. As the poet H. Levick said: 'I 
fall, I get up. I fall again, I get up again.' It is not a matter of 'Can we 
rebuild?' but that we must." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the government on Wednesday issued its first arrest warrants in the 
case, the largest Jewish community in Latin America was beginning to emerge 
from the shock and despair that engulfed it after a car bomb on July 18 
destroyed the Buenos Aires headquarters of the community's social services. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Argentina's Jews look to the long process of recovery, they are 
assessing the permanent psychological damage, fears and uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
 In these post-crisis assessments, some Argentine Jews speak with new 
bitterness. They watch in dismay as non-Jewish Argentines take their children 
out of schools near Jewish offices. They see new outbreaks of an anti-Semitism 
that, one way or another, has long existed in Argentina. And they feel a 
growing apprehension that the investigation into the bombing will never turn up 
those truly responsible, leaving open the possibility of another attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terror not only managed to kill 100 people, wound 200 and leave a crater in 
the middle of the city," said Ruben Beraja, a banker and community leader. 
"Terror also managed to install a certain amount of fear. The spirit and color 
of the city has been changed. Look, (many) days have passed (since the bombing) 
and we are still trapped by trauma and shock." 
</P>
<P>
 There are outward signs of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The frenetic pace has slowed at the Marc Chagall Cultural Center, which became 
a makeshift command post for teams of counselors and rescue workers and where 
some 500 relatives awaited tragic news during the first days after the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruins of the seven-story building -- the terrorists' target -- have been 
mostly cleared away. All but 10 victims have been identified and buried; DNA 
testing is expected to give names to the last 10. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Israeli experts, Jewish schools are instructing their 
teachers to incorporate the bombing into their curricula, and enhanced security 
now means leaving cellular telephones and electronic date books at the front 
desks of many synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain is enormous," said Enrique Klein, a publicist who was badly hurt in 
the 1992 car-bombing of Buenos Aires' Israeli Embassy, which almost killed his 
wife. "But that doesn't mean you cross your arms. You have to keep fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Jews fleeing pogroms and prejudice began migrating to distant Argentina from 
Russia and Europe in the latter half of the 19th Century, colonizing vast, 
vacant pampas as farmers and merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1882, the first rabbi was recognized by the government; by 1898, three 
newspapers were being published in Yiddish. The Jewish exiles' first rural 
colony was called "Moisesville" -- Moises is Spanish for Moses -- and populated 
by thousands of Jewish gauchos, or cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Descendants of the first Jewish settlers became part of Argentina's prosperous 
middle class. Many Jews today, despite Argentina's persistent current of 
anti-Semitism, hold prominent positions in government and business. The 
community numbers about 250,000, having declined in recent years because of 
migration to Israel and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 This history was meticulously detailed in the largest library of Judaica in 
Latin America, a compilation of 70,000 books, diaries, original birth and death 
certificates and other papers housed under the Jewish Scientific Institute and 
founded by Rollansky. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the priceless works were destroyed in the bombing. "I have lived to 
see my own funeral," Rollansky tearfully told reporters on July 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in an interview at his apartment in the center of the Once 
neighborhood, established as Buenos Aires' first Jewish ghetto at the turn of 
the century, Rollansky recalled how he began collecting the materials after his 
immigration to Argentina from Poland in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items housed in the library and archives were original, 
irreplaceable works of 16th- and 17th-Century literature, 19th-Century Hebrew 
magazines, phonographic recordings of Jewish tango stars, files documenting the 
Jewish immigration to South America, World War II memorabilia, a model of a 
Nazi concentration camp.. 
</P>
<P>
 "A diabolical bomb, placed by diabolical people, destroyed some of the most 
peaceful and noble work imaginable," Rollansky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Jews fear that one of the lasting aftereffects of the bombing will be a 
new wave of subtle and not-so-subtle anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
 They cringed at hearing people refer to the "innocent victims" of the bombing 
-- the non-Jewish passersby or workers. Parents have reportedly withdrawn 50 
children from La Salle Catholic school across the street from the Chagall 
Center in the last week; fearful residents have staged protest rallies over the 
possible location of an Egyptian Embassy in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen the best, and the worst, come out," said Edgardo Knopoff, 32, a 
psychoanalyst. "There have been expressions of solidarity and support, and 
there has been discrimination. Sometimes this kind of (overt) fear exacerbates 
a fear that is latent in society." 
</P>
<P>
 Knopoff and others blame the bombing, in part, on the "country's sickness." 
They say a government that has not done enough to eradicate anti-Semitism, and 
a society that tolerates extremist hatreds and prejudice, helped to create a 
climate that permits attacks on Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an Islamic fundamentalist group claimed responsibility, the 1992 
embassy bombing was never fully resolved, and no one was ever arrested. Despite 
assurances from President Carlos Saul Menem that this time will be different, 
and the government taking concrete steps in the prosecution of the case 
Wednesday, many Argentines have their doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took the first case as isolated," said Fabian Triskier, 30, a 
psychiatrist. "Now we are convinced a third attack could come." 
</P>
<P>
 Triskier, Knopoff and psychologist Alejandro Stilerman, 36, are members of a 
volunteer health team that has worked practically around the clock to counsel 
victims of the bombing and the relatives of the dead. With the crisis easing, 
they were able to take time to sit down and speak to a reporter last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking furiously, the three said the bombing and its consequences have forced 
them to re-examine their own religious commitment. Knopoff said he had not been 
to synagogue in 10 years. "Now," he said, "I don't know. I want to analyze 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 The counselors said they found poignant solace from another ugly chapter of 
recent Argentine history: Argentines who lost children or other relatives in 
the "dirty war" gave words of comfort and advice. That war was a campaign of 
terror by the Argentine military and fascist groups in the late 1970s and early 
'80s that killed thousands of dissidents, students and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest major incident of anti-Jewish violence in Buenos Aires was 
recorded in January, 1919, when angry mobs denouncing "Bolshevism" hunted down 
and beat Jews, looted Jewish-owned businesses and burned two Jewish libraries. 
The Semana Tragica (Tragic Week) left a toll of one dead and 71 injured, 
Ricardo Feierstein said in his 1993 book, "Historia de los Judios Argentinos." 
</P>
<P>
 The mobs were led, Feierstein said, by the sons of some of Argentina's 
wealthiest families, who wanted to protect their vision of a national identity 
-- conservative and Roman Catholic -- that the Jews, portrayed as foreigners 
and leftists, threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Jews continued to be attacked in the decades that followed, especially under 
the government of Gen. Juan Peron, who welcomed Nazi fugitives to Argentina 
after World War II. As recently as January of this year, the chief rabbi of 
Buenos Aires, Salomon Benhamu, was beaten by a gang on his way to synagogue.

PADDLING BILL DEFEATED IN ASSEMBLY PANEL; LEGISLATION: PROPOSAL TO PUNISH 
GRAFFITI VANDALS IS REJECTED BY ONE VOTE. SPEAKER BROWN TALKED DEMOCRATIC 
CO-AUTHOR INTO CHANGING HIS POSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite intense election-year pressure to appear tough on crime, a deeply 
divided Assembly committee rejected a bill Wednesday that would have allowed 
juvenile court judges to punish youthful graffiti vandals with as many as 10 
whacks from a wooden paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Ways and Means Committee voted 11-11 on the measure, authored by 
Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), failing by the slimmest of margins to 
muster the dozen votes needed for the bill to escape the 23-member committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy expressed confidence late in the afternoon that the bill -- inspired by 
the highly publicized caning of American teen-ager Michael Fay, who was 
convicted of spray-painting cars in Singapore -- would win the necessary 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 But it died after Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and other Democratic leaders 
pulled aside Assemblyman H. Willard Murray Jr. (D-Paramount), a co-author of 
Conroy's bill, and persuaded him to switch his vote just before the committee 
adjourned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got speakerized," Conroy said, using the term coined to reflect Brown's 
ability to sway the votes of errant Democrats. "This is a textbook example of 
how the Democrats are able to bottle up good legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray said he still supports Conroy's measure but decided to switch after 
Brown and other top Democrats told him it was a "wedge bill" designed to be 
used in the upcoming elections to embarrass Democrats who vote against the 
paddling proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it became a partisan issue, so being a good team player, I went along 
with what they wanted," Murray said. "There were a number of Democratic 
members, six or eight, who asked me to change my vote. . . . I won't lose a 
great deal of sleep over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's proposal received nationwide publicity in the weeks after he 
suggested that judges be allowed to order parents or court bailiffs to 
administer four to 10 strokes with a three-quarter-inch-thick wooden paddle to 
convicted graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy began pursuing the idea after he was prodded by constituents and staff 
members caught up in the highly publicized debate over the Singapore case. Fay, 
an 18-year-old high school senior from Dayton, Ohio, received four strokes from 
a rattan cane May 5 after being found guilty of vandalism in the island nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's bill also would have required publicizing the names of juvenile 
offenders who were paddled, a tactic designed to heighten humiliation and deter 
would-be taggers. In addition, the measure contained a sunset clause that would 
have required the Legislature to renew its approval after paddling was given a 
three-year trial run. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the paddling bill "met its appropriate fate" and that, with 
politicians whipped up by election-year fervor over crime, it represented a 
"terrible way to make public policy."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: PUTTING OUT THEIR HANDS ONE LAST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Legislature is truly amazing. It's hard to tell whether our 
lawmakers are masochistic, arrogant, desperate, stupid, piggish or all of the 
above. Signs point to the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 It's August again and the Legislature has placed another softball on a batting 
tee and invited the news media to swing away. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what I'm referring to: We're down to the final four weeks of the 
legislative session. It's do or die for hundreds of bills, affecting virtually 
every special interest in the state. The Capitol corridors and committee rooms 
are packed with lobbyists conniving to keep some bills alive and kill others. 
At stake may be millions for their clients and a livelihood for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 These lobbyists would trade one week on their cellular phones for one private 
minute with a committee chairman or a swing vote legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 So if you're a legislator, what better time to invite lobbyists to a 
fund-raiser, to ask them to hit up their clients for donations to your campaign 
kitty? 
</P>
<P>
 It smacks of extortion. But it's legal, as long as any hint of a quid pro quo 
is confined to body language and nuance. Everybody these days is leery of 
somebody maybe wearing an FBI wire after 14 federal convictions stemming from a 
sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have in the August orgy," says Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), "is 
a huge fire sale: 'Buy your access now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe your bills, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is an old, annual news story. The astonishing thing is that the 
Legislature keeps perpetuating it -- in the wake of corruption scandals, the 
voters' angry imposition of term limits and miserable job ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 One disgusted lobbyist showed me his thick file of fund-raising invitations. 
It was growing daily, but by Tuesday morning there were 101 for August. To 
attend each would cost him nearly $57,000, which he had no intention of doing. 
On next Tuesday and Wednesday alone, 15 events are scheduled each day. The 
following Tuesday 16 are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The going rate is $500 per ticket. But committee chairmen and legislative 
leaders can command $750 or $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Depending on where the event is, I can tell you what'll be on the buffet 
table and where the shrimp will be," says the veteran lobbyist, who, like his 
colleagues, requested anonymity. "If anybody thinks these things are fun, 
they've only been to one in their life." 
</P>
<P>
 Another lobbyist for a business group complained that "everybody's standing 
there (in the Legislature) with their hand out. We decided not to go to any 
fund-raisers this month. We simply felt they've crossed the line. It's no 
longer ethical." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were talking about it, saying if they're serious about legislating, that's 
what they ought to be doing this month instead of raising money. If they're not 
serious now, when the hell are they going to be serious?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another longtime lobbyist says: "It's outrageous, unbelievable, unseemly." 
</P>
<P>
 During the corruption trials, he says, he began thinking about the late 
Speaker Jesse Unruh's famous admonition to rookie legislators about lobbyists: 
"If you can't eat their food, drink their booze, (make love to) their women and 
then vote against them, you don't belong up here." 
</P>
<P>
 But "that's wishful thinking," this lobbyist asserts. "The fact is, as human 
beings you're influenced by that. You're influenced by money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No party, gender or age group has a corner on Sacramento fund raising. Indeed, 
some "fresh blood" rookies who promised "change" in their 1992 races are in 
danger of being corrupted by the very system they ran against. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to live with reality," says Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del 
Rey), a widely respected newcomer. "I conduct myself according to current 
rules. The rules need to be changed, but I won't be here to change them if I 
don't run an active campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 She's having one of those 15 fund-raisers next Tuesday. The cover: $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every fund-raising lawmaker is even running for reelection. "Please join 
Assemblyman Paul Woodruff for his last Sacramento fund-raiser to retire his 
1988 campaign debt," reads an invitation from the Moreno Valley Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a moral obligation to try to pay off this debt. I owe like $40,000," 
Woodruff says. "But if I make $5,000, I'll laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, a strong advocate of reform, says: "The 
whole campaign finance system offends me. We have a lot of very good people 
trapped in a very bad system." 
</P>
<P>
 But they do have the power to change that system.

BORROWING FOR STATE HIGHWAY PROJECTS OKD; FINANCES: OFFICIALS APPROVE 
SHORT-TERM NOTES TO CONTINUE ESSENTIAL WORK BUT CONCEDE THAT INDEBTEDNESS MAY 
CAUSE MORE DELAYS LATER ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Faced with growing public disgruntlement over delays in state highway 
construction, the Wilson Administration embarked Wednesday on a $750-million 
borrowing program to give it the cash to continue the most critical projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the California Transportation Commission gave its approval for the 
Administration to float short-term notes, officials admitted that borrowing 
against gasoline tax revenues could cause even more projects to be stalled in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question there may be some projects that are subject to delay (in 
the future) . . . but we felt this was the best alternative that existed for us 
in view of this empty cupboard that we're looking at right now," said Business, 
Transportation and Housing Agency Secretary Dean Dunphy. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to resort to short-term indebtedness comes after voters defeated 
in June a proposed $2-billion bond issue that would have provided enough cash 
for many of the projects. And it contradicts Gov. Pete Wilson's interpretation 
of the election results, which he characterized as a clear message from voters 
that they were reluctant to finance any more government services through 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, state government has depended increasingly on borrowing to 
make up for revenue shortages and to resolve financial crises. The state budget 
enacted in July relies on more than $7 billion in borrowing over the next two 
years -- at a cost to taxpayers of more than $500 million in interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's credit rating is so weak that the government had to pay $30 
million to a consortium of banks to act as co-signers on those notes, agreeing 
to repay borrowers if the state defaults. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they do not know yet how much the notes approved 
Wednesday will cost California taxpayers but they said they expect to repay the 
last of them by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The borrowing for transportation will permit a series of important projects -- 
mostly outside Los Angeles County -- to proceed. They had been temporarily 
frozen when the state ran short of cash. The delays had begun to generate 
criticism and negative newspaper editorials, many directed at the Wilson 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new cash, the state will begin construction of critical interchanges 
at Interstate 680 and California 24 in San Francisco's East Bay and on 
California 99 at Livingston in the San Joaquin Valley. In Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties, the borrowing will make available $11.8 million for the 
construction of car-pool lanes on the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial crisis in the state's transportation program has been looming 
for years as costs for a seismic strengthening program for bridges have soared 
and gasoline tax revenues, which finance the program, have slumped below 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Exacerbating the situation were the failures of two bond issues -- the 
$2-billion one in June and an earlier $1-billion proposal to pay for mass 
transit. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan approved Wednesday got mixed reactions from legislators who have been 
urging Wilson to come up with new ways to finance transportation after the June 
bond failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who 
authored the legislation permitting the short-term borrowing, said the 
governor's plan made sense but did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm supportive but he's only dealt with half the problem," Katz said. "I do 
think you're being less than completely honest with the public if you create 
the impression that this borrowing solves all the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 He said it is essential for the state to devise new sources of revenue for 
transportation improvements, and said they undoubtedly will involve some form 
of tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor may not want to support a tax now but he is creating the 
inevitability of a tax or some other way of financing because this short-term 
borrowing will only make the deficit bigger," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz and Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Quentin L. Kopp (I-San 
Francisco) accused the Administration of using short-term borrowing as a way to 
avoid confronting the financial crisis in the transportation program until 
after the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 "This plan isn't free and it's unnecessarily costly," Kopp said. "It's adding 
another expense which must be subtracted from the state highway account. It's 
election year stuff to assuage the people until we get past November." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunphy said the governor plans to appoint a task force to study transportation 
finances and report next spring with proposals for solving the problem. He said 
a tax increase is likely to be studied, along with proposals to decrease 
funding for administration of the program.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; CANDIDATES' CRIME PROPOSALS CALLED 
UNREALISTIC; CRITICS SAY BROWN AND WILSON ARE IGNORING ISSUES OF COST AND 
EFFECTIVENESS IN THE DEBATE OVER WHOSE STANCE IS TOUGHER. MEANWHILE, AT 
SIMULTANEOUS NEWS CONFERENCES, THE BATTLE ESCALATES.

 As Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Kathleen Brown escalated their crime 
wars Wednesday, a leading criminal justice expert said there is no evidence 
that the tough lock-'em-up proposals they are making will have any real impact 
on violent crime in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Greenwood, chief of criminal justice research at the RAND Corp. in Santa 
Monica, said of the gubernatorial candidates' increasingly bitter exchange over 
violent crime: "It's like a power-lifting contest to see who gets a hernia 
first. It's the taxpayers who are going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwood said it was irresponsible for the two candidates to promise to lock 
up convicts for longer and longer terms without discussing the potential tax 
cost to Californians or the sacrifices made in other programs to pay for the 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 A prominent Democrat in the Legislature also was critical Wednesday of the 
tone of the crime debate in the race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg of Sacramento said, "They are both taking 
positions -- and I mean both -- that sound attractive in the middle of the 
campaign but are absolutely impossible to implement as a matter of governance." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Greenwood and Isenberg commented in response to questions during 
telephone interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, Brown and Wilson have battled in public over who would be tougher 
on violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has attempted to overcome Wilson's presumed edge on the crime issue by 
attacking his parole policies as too lenient, allowing murderers, rapists and 
others back on the street to prey on citizens again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson zealously embraced the "three strikes" bill to send three-time felons 
to prison for life and now is proposing that rapists get life without parole on 
a first conviction. Wilson argues that it is impossible for Brown to be tougher 
than he on criminals because she personally opposes the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's standard response is that she will enforce the death penalty law just 
as vigorously as Wilson, and that she supports "three strikes" and a 
"one-strike" rape bill, although a more liberal one than Wilson proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the two candidates battled anew in Los Angeles news conferences 
a few miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles County Courthouse, Brown accused Wilson of failing to 
deliver on a 1990 campaign promise to make it a felony -- rather than a 
misdemeanor -- for a convicted sex offender to fail to register with 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means nearly 49,000 rapists and child molesters are on the loose -- 
49,000 sex offenders who are missing and we hope not in action," Brown said. 
"That's 49,000 offenders that Pete Wilson has lost track of and cannot find." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same hour, Wilson was at a Los Angeles County juvenile detention center 
to claim that gangs are deliberately using 14-year-old and 15-year-old 
"predators" as triggermen in holdups, carjackings and drive-by shootings 
because they cannot be prosecuted as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know that the law literally permits them to get away with murder and 
that simply is not tolerable," said a grim-faced Wilson as he promoted a 
Senate-passed bill to allow the youths to face adult punishment in the 
commission of murder, rape and other serious and violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as wards of the California Youth Authority, they must be released at age 
25 without any further restriction, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in response to Brown on the rape issue, Wilson's office said that he 
signed legislation in 1993 that increased sentences for repeat sex offenders to 
25 years to life in prison. Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur said the 
sentencing law was a more effective way of keeping tabs on sex offenders 
"because they'd be behind bars." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson chided Brown for being in Washington this week rather than in 
Sacramento to help lobby the Assembly Public Safety Committee to approve a 
Wilson-backed bill to extend the death penalty to those convicted of murder in 
carjackings and drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson organized a rally at the Capitol in Sacramento this week to pressure 
the Democrat-controlled committee to approve the bill, but the measure failed 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said of her absence, "I was fighting for money for California" in 
Washington, in part by lobbying California members to vote for the omnibus 
crime bill now before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown added that she called three Democratic members of the committee on her 
return from Washington. By then, the committee was in session and two of the 
three had already voted against the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she argued for the bill to get out of the committee so that 
Californians would have a chance to decide the issue. Brown has said she would 
cast her own vote against extending the death penalty to any more crimes, but 
would enforce the will of the people if she is elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg, one of the three called by Brown -- and an opponent of the bill -- 
said that he and Brown had a "polite but firm" talk. He then commented on the 
nature of the crime debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The discussion here is kind of a one-upmanship . . ." Isenberg said. "It's a 
lot harder to read a bill and vote on an actual law." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwood, the RAND official, said the campaign debate also overlooks the fact 
that most of the judges appointed in California in recent years are tough 
sentencers and that prison populations have soared. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public gets fed this story that we're soft on criminals," he said. "It's 
the wrong story." In fact, the overall crime rate is down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should start accepting the fact that some of the stuff we've done in the 
past is working," Greenwood added. Wilson, Brown to Debate Oct. 16; Event Will 
Be Broadcast Statewide 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown agreed 
Wednesday to at least one statewide radio and television debate, on Oct. 16, 
and said they would negotiate additional meetings before the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 16 event will be sponsored by the California Broadcasters Assn. and 
probably will originate from television station KGO in San Francisco, the 
candidates' campaigns announced after a 45-minute meeting. Details, such as the 
length of the debate and format, will be worked out later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign also announced that it had accepted three other debate 
invitations, originating in San Diego, Sacramento and Fresno, and wanted a 
fifth meeting in Los Angeles. Wilson officials said they would like to hold 
additional debates before and after the Oct. 16 session provided all are 
broadcast statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 During the primary campaign, Brown insisted that several debates with her 
Democratic foes only be broadcast regionally.

RABIN, ARAFAT MEET IN ATTEMPT TO ALLEVIATE NEW TENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still basking in public approval of his first open trip to Jordan, Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin returned Wednesday to his hard-slogging 
negotiations on Palestinian self-rule with Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting between the two leaders at the Erez checkpoint was billed as a 
chance to discuss the myriad problems Arafat faces as he tries to build a 
government in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin aides said the session was really intended to reassure the 
Palestinian leader that Israel has not abandoned him in favor of King Hussein 
of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations between Israel and the Palestinians have grown tense since Hussein 
decided to speed up his negotiations with Israel. Arafat has fretted publicly 
about a provision in last month's Washington declaration ending the 46-year 
state of war between Israel and Jordan; the accord included language 
recognizing a special role for Jordan in protecting Jerusalem's Muslim holy 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat also has complained to interviewers that his government is broke and 
that promised aid from international donors has failed to materialize. He has 
described himself as "in despair" and warned that the experiment in Palestinian 
self-rule is in danger of collapsing without more cooperation from Israel and 
the international community. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin told reporters after Wednesday's session that Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators will continue talks next Monday on transferring more authority from 
Israel to the Palestinians in the territories and on speeding up preparations 
for the first Palestinian elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel tried to improve the atmosphere for the talks by releasing eight female 
Palestinian prisoners just hours before the two leaders met. Arafat described 
the session as "positive" when speaking to reporters with Rabin afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arafat was bombarded with questions from Israeli reporters about a 
statement reportedly made by Farouk Kaddoumi, the PLO's foreign minister, in a 
radio speech Monday. Kaddoumi reportedly said on PLO radio's last broadcast 
from Tunis, Tunisia: "There is a state which was established through historical 
force and it must be destroyed. This is the Palestinian way. They seized our 
land. The refugees must return to their land." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat refused to condemn the statement, although Rabin said that "it is 
inconceivable that the issue will be treated lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said Kaddoumi's apparent call for the destruction of Israel contradicts 
the agreement -- signed on Sept. 13, 1993, between Israel and the PLO -- that 
granted limited self-rule to Palestinians living in Israeli-occupied territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and Jordan are said to be close to an agreement on granting passage of 
civilian flights through each other's airspace; their tourism ministers are set 
to meet soon to discuss international marketing of package tours to both 
nations. Israeli tourists carrying passports from some other nations are 
already being welcomed in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast between Rabin's evident delight on Monday in dealing with Hussein 
-- Rabin dined with him at the king's summer palace in Aqaba, then joined him 
for a cruise in the Gulf of Aqaba -- and his strictly business approach to 
Arafat was commented on this week by Israeli pundits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat feels neglected, pushed aside by Israel and the international 
community and left on his own to tread the very uncelebratory alleyways of the 
autonomy," opined Shlomo Ginossaur in the left-of-center daily Davar. "Arafat 
would rather see Rabin smiling and generous, and Rabin would rather see Arafat 
shaven, his head uncovered, wearing a normal civilian suit, expressing himself 
in fluent English like his majesty the royal highness."

NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE; HEALTH CARE: PROS AND CONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three main health reform plans are under debate in Congress -- a Republican 
plan offered by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and Democratic plans 
by Sen. George J. Mitchell of Maine and Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. 
The description of pros and cons below relies on analyses of the Mitchell bill 
by the Congressional Budget Office and of the Dole bill by the health 
consulting firm of Lewin-VHI. Gephardt's bill has not been finalized but is 
similar to the bill passed by the House Ways and Means Committee, which was 
analyzed by CBO. All three bills will be subject to extensive debate and 
amendment over the next few weeks. EMPLOYER MANDATE 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt: Firms would be required to provide insurance to all workers. The 
employer would pay 80%, the employee 20%. The requirement would be phased in 
for large employers in 1997 and small companies in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell: No mandate initially. If 95% of the legal residents of a state are 
not covered by 2000, a mandate will take effect in that state starting in 2002. 
Under the mandate, companies and workers would share the cost of premiums 
50-50, although a company could pay more if it wished. Companies with fewer 
than 25 workers would not be covered by the mandate, but all individuals would 
be required to have insurance if the mandate is triggered. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole: No mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Pros: A mandate is the simplest way to guarantee that everyone has coverage. 
Without a mandate, some people and some companies get a free ride, receiving 
care from a system that everyone else pays for. Without a mandate, the 
government will have to pay more in subsidies to encourage people to buy 
insurance if the goal of increased coverage is to be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Cons: Any new requirement on employers raises the cost of doing business. The 
mandate would probably cause some job loss in some companies, although it might 
lead to job gains in other companies, such as those that already offer 
insurance and now face competition from free-riders. Enforcing the mandate 
could also be expensive and require new bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50% mandate would impose less burden on business, but it would also 
require greater government subsidies if low-income workers are to afford 
insurance. If companies that now offer 80% coverage decide to drop to 50%, 
costs could rise for middle-income families. Some analysts argue that making 
families pay a greater share of the cost of insurance would reduce waste by 
making Americans more conscious of medical care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's proposal that the mandate be imposed state by state and that 
smaller firms be exempt could create serious problems. Large companies that 
operate in several states would face conflicting rules. So would people who 
live in one state but work in another. Companies near the 25-worker limit would 
have a strong incentive to find ways to evade the requirement. SUBSIDIES 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt: The government would pay subsidies to families with incomes up to 
2.4 times the federal poverty level (a total of roughly $36,000 for a family of 
four). Those with income below the poverty line ($14,800 for a family of four 
in 1993) would get a full subsidy, which would then gradually phase out as 
income rises. Estimated cost: $76 billion in 1998, $118 billion in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell: Because Mitchell does not have an employer mandate in his bill, he 
includes broader subsidies. All families up to 2 times the poverty line would 
receive subsidies. Families with children up to 18 or pregnant women would get 
subsidies if their incomes were up to 3 times poverty. All subsidies would 
phase out gradually above the poverty line. In addition, workers who lose their 
jobs would be eligible for part-year subsidies even if their income while 
working exceeded the poverty line. Estimated cost: $104 billion in 1998, $131 
billion in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole: Subsidies would be available for families up to 1.5 times the poverty 
level, with full subsidies at 100% of poverty, phasing out as income goes up. A 
new tax deduction would be available for workers who pay the cost of their own 
insurance. Estimated cost: $19 billion in 1998, $29 billion in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Pros and Cons: Dole's subsidies cost much less but provide far less benefit. A 
family of four earning $25,000 per year would have to pay the full cost of 
insurance -- about $6,000 per year for a comprehensive policy. Under Gephardt's 
bill, by contrast, the same family would have to spend about $560. The 
government would subsidize the rest. Also, under Dole's bill, subsidies would 
phase out more quickly for low-income families, which could give them a strong 
disincentive against earning more money. INSURANCE MARKET REFORM 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt: Insurers could not use pre-existing conditions to refuse coverage. 
Groups of 100 or fewer would pay premiums based on a "community rate" in which 
all members of a region would pay roughly the same premium. States could 
establish voluntary or mandatory health purchasing cooperatives for businesses 
to use in buying insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell: Insurers could not use pre-existing conditions to refuse coverage. 
Groups of 500 or fewer would pay premiums based on a modified community rate 
that until 2002 would allow insurers to charge older people up to twice the 
premium charged to younger people. States would establish voluntary health 
purchasing cooperatives, and businesses would be required to give employees 
access to them, even if the business did not contribute to the cost of 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole: Insurers generally could not use pre-existing conditions to refuse 
coverage. Groups of 50 or fewer would pay premiums based on a modified 
community rate that until 1998 would allow insurers to charge older people up 
to four times the premium charged to younger people. After 1998 insurers would 
be allowed to charge older customers up to three times what they charge younger 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Pros and Cons: Community rating saves money by eliminating the incentive for 
insurers to seek out only younger, healthier workers to cover. Under community 
rating, rates for younger customers will go up while rates for older people 
will come down. Because younger people are already less likely to buy 
insurance, that increase in rates could cause more people to drop insurance if 
no mandate is in force. That in turn would push rates up for everyone else. 
FINANCING 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt: Medicaid recipients would be enrolled in the new subsidy programs 
and would buy private insurance. As of 1998, that would free up $98 billion now 
spent on Medicaid. In addition, the bill would make reductions in Medicare -- 
$18 billion per year as of 1998, $32 billion per year by 2000. The bill also 
would raise about $10 billion in new taxes, primarily through increasing the 
tobacco tax and ending some health-related tax deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell: Most Medicaid recipients would be enrolled in the new subsidy 
programs and would buy private insurance. As of 1998, that would free up $76 
billion. The bill would make reductions in Medicare of about $14 billion per 
year. It would also raise taxes -- roughly $20 billion per year in 1998, 
through increasing the tobacco tax, ending some health-related tax deductions 
and imposing a new premium tax on "high cost" health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole: Some Medicaid recipients would be enrolled in the new subsidy plan. No 
estimate is yet available on how much money would be freed up as a result. In 
addition, the bill would reduce Medicare spending by about $11 billion in 1998. 
It would not increase the tobacco tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Pros and Cons: Hospitals and doctors worry that the Medicare cuts would reduce 
their incomes and say the reductions might cause some health providers to stop 
taking Medicare patients. On the other hand, expanded coverage would mean that 
those same doctors and hospitals would have fewer uninsured patients to whom 
they would be providing free care. The Congressional Budget Office has 
estimated that Mitchell's bill and the House Ways and Means bill would slightly 
reduce the federal deficit over time. The analysis has not yet been completed 
on Dole's bill. WHERE TO WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 CNN plans extensive live coverage of the U.S. Senate health care debate. 
Coverage begins with start of the debate, tentatively scheduled for 6 a.m. PCT.

FRENCH TROOPS EDGY AS THEY PULL OUT OF RWANDA; AFRICA: SOLDIERS ARE UNCERTAIN 
WHETHER ANOTHER HUGE REFUGEE EXODUS COULD FOLLOW THEIR DEPARTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 French soldiers protecting an estimated 1.2 million panicky Rwandans continued 
their pullout from this tortured African country Wednesday, still uncertain 
whether another colossal refugee stampede is developing. 
</P>
<P>
 French commanders, who have already cut their force by about half, pressed 
ahead with their plan for a complete withdrawal from their security zone in 
southwestern Rwanda by Aug. 22, although there are broad appeals for their 
troops to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hundred French troops now provide a shield that keeps a giant mass of 
Hutus from bolting across the border into Zaire. At worst, such a flight could 
rival the tragedy of Hutus who have already crossed the border farther north in 
one of the deadliest refugee movements in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very difficult to predict the reaction of large crowds. And they are 
gathering in the camps here every day. The psychology of this can go very 
quickly," said French Marine Col. Erik de Stabenrath, commander of this zone. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hutus rush across the border to Bukavu, Zaire, in coming days, they face 
conditions hardly better than the disease and despair that greeted the 1 
million or so Rwandan refugees who went into Goma, Zaire, last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cannot happen again -- it simply cannot happen because it is too horrible 
to happen," pleaded Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Hutus stay put, their future may not be so bright either. Perhaps 1 
million of the Hutus here already are refugees from other parts of the country, 
and what awaits them -- sooner or later -- is yet another bloody chapter in 
their death struggle for ethnic revenge, the French say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hutus once were the overwhelming majority in this small, mountainous 
country. They lost a civil war last month to a Tutsi-controlled rebel army. The 
invading Tutsi themselves were primarily refugees who grew up in Uganda after 
an earlier round of Rwandan ethnic struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than a backdrop to civil war, Rwanda in 1994 turned into a human 
slaughterhouse. Before losing and leaving, Hutus rampaged across the land and 
murdered eight of 10 Tutsi civilians, according to estimates here. "In one 
sector north of here, there were 13,400 Tutsi in April. Only 200 were left 
alive," said De Stabenrath. 
</P>
<P>
 For that very convincing reason, the Hutus fear being left unprotected against 
the vengeance that is the history of Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can cope with disease -- (but) the Tutsi soldiers will kill us for sure," 
said Venuste Hakizimana, 25, a Hutu teacher. "If the French leave, who will 
protect us? We are wondering: 'Can we stay? Or should we go?' I talk about this 
a great deal with my friends. We have decided if the French leave, we will 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Hakizimana says he set himself a Sunday deadline. After that, he said, he will 
begin the five-day march from Gikongoro over a steep mountain road to reach 
Zaire before the last of the French soldiers go home. 
</P>
<P>
 African troops of the United Nations already are moving into the region to try 
to maintain a shield for the Hutus. But neither African soldiers nor the United 
Nations is widely trusted here. 
</P>
<P>
 For the short run, De Stabenrath said he hopes that African troops can 
establish credibility with Rwandan Hutus quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, one part of the French zone has been turned over to troops from 
Ghana. Soldiers from Chad arrived Wednesday. "And the mass exodus of refugees 
that was predicted did not materialize," the colonel said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the U.N. troops can maintain the Hutus' trust, the French will have 
breathing room to make their exit and not be blamed for another refugee exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 But even so, De Stabenrath said his dealings with the Rwandans leave him 
pessimistic about their future. "Hutus here are talking about revenge for the 
revenge they expect will be taken on them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to one Hutu man," he noted, "who was forced to bury his (Tutsi) wife 
alive. She was in the grave and he was shoveling dirt onto her and they were 
praying together. Things in this place are beyond comprehension." 
</P>
<P>
 The French are arranging talks between an appointed council of Hutu leaders 
and officials of the Tutsi-controlled Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). 
</P>
<P>
 The country's new leaders have said the Hutus are free to return and will not 
be subject to government persecution -- except those who were guilty of 
massacres of helpless Tutsi civilians. Twice, so far, a Hutu council has met 
with the RPF at a site across the border from the French-controlled sector. As 
a result, De Stabenrath said he senses increased confidence on the part of the 
Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the French are negotiating to bring RPF officials into the French-occupied 
zone to meet, face to face, with the anxious Hutus here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that will do a lot of good for the population," De Stabenrath said.

BANGLADESH'S CONTROVERSIAL FEMINIST WRITER FLEES COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charged by a magistrate with offending Muslims and threatened by Islamic 
zealots with assassination, Bangladesh's most controversial writer, feminist 
Taslima Nasrin, has furtively left her country. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in Sweden on what appeared to have been a secret flight from 
Southeast Asia, the 31-year-old author announced Wednesday that she wanted to 
"rest and work" and went into seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bangladesh, there were angry statements from some militant groups, while 
others wished their nemesis good riddance. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Secretary Azim Uddin Ahmed said that under terms of Nasrin's bail, 
granted last week, "she was free to go anywhere she liked, and that's what she 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Nasrin's ultimate intentions were unclear. The Swedish Foreign Ministry, which 
announced in a brief statement her secrecy- and security-laden arrival in 
Stockholm, would not say how or when she traveled, where she was staying or 
what her final destination was. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home, some doubted that Bangladesh's most keenly contested cultural 
figure will ever return. "I don't think she'll be coming back -- at least not 
for some time," said Serajul Islam Choudhury, a professor of English literature 
at Dhaka University. "She is rather desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Ali Ahmed, a leader of the Jamaat-i-Islami, the country's largest Islamic 
political party, said of Nasrin's departure: "If it is true, we shall now 
breathe easily." He said she should have been deported "so the nation would not 
have unnecessarily wasted its time and energy on her." 
</P>
<P>
 But Muslim clergyman Fazlulhaq Amini, who has already issued a religious edict 
calling for Nasrin's death, declared "there is no safe haven anywhere in the 
world for the infidel." A spokesman for 13 Bangladeshi fundamentalist groups 
demanded that the government of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia conduct a trial for 
the author in absentia and said it will be toppled if it fails to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 As protests from some Islamic organizations mounted, security was stepped up 
in the diplomatic enclave of the Bangladeshi capital where Western countries 
have their missions. 
</P>
<P>
 For those here who see the best guarantee for Bangladesh's future in the 
consolidation of the existing secular state, the controversy over Nasrin sums 
up, in microcosm, the debate about what sort of Islam -- fundamentalist or more 
tolerant -- will prevail in the poor, densely populated country that until 1971 
was part of Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Bangladesh, the case has been chiefly seen as one of the perils of 
free expression faced with an increasingly militant Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 It evokes parallels with the plight of Indian-born Salman Rushdie, who has 
been in hiding since 1989 because of Muslim death threats sparked by his novel 
"The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
 Nasrin's case also has posed questions about the role that women can 
rightfully aspire to in modern Islamic society. 
</P>
<P>
 The usually high-profile novelist and polemicist went into hiding on June 4 
after many of her fellow citizens reacted with rage to comments she supposedly 
made about Islam's holiest book. Nasrin was quoted as telling a Calcutta 
newspaper that the Koran needs to be revised to bring it up to date. She later 
said she had been misquoted. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her denials, the often outspoken Nasrin was charged by a Dhaka judge 
with hurting religious feelings in a country whose population is 90% Muslim; a 
warrant was issued for her arrest. If convicted under a statute dating to the 
British colonial era, she could be sentenced to two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 3, after two months underground, Nasrin resurfaced in a sari and head 
scarf before the Bangladesh High Court and was granted bail upon payment of 
$120. "I feared for my life, and that is why I was hiding," she told the court. 
No trial date was set then. 
</P>
<P>
 Militant Muslim groups had offered cash rewards of up to $5,000 to anyone who 
killed Nasrin. On June 30, they organized rallies across the country that 
brought 50,000 people into Dhaka's streets, shouting for her execution. At 
least 55 people were hurt in clashes between her foes, supporters and police. 
</P>
<P>
 In Stockholm, Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas told a news 
conference that Nasrin was in Sweden on a tourist visa and had not been granted 
political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasrin, in a brief statement issued through Stockholm journalist Gabriel 
Gleichmann, said: "I have come to Sweden at the invitation of the Swedish PEN 
Club (a writers organization) to rest and work. . . . I would like to thank all 
those who have supported me at home and abroad."

 Although the Bangladesh High Court provided her with police protection after 
granting her bail, Nasrin appeared fearful to people she met in Dhaka. About 
two dozen police were deployed at one point outside her apartment; the writer 
worried aloud that they might not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 When an Associated Press reporter managed last week to sneak past the police 
cordon and make his way to her 10th-floor apartment, Nasrin snapped: "How could 
they let you in? This means they are not doing enough to check the visitors." 
</P>
<P>
 Although reunited with her parents, brother and sister, she was still visibly 
suffering. "I had gone though terrible mental torture," she said, breaking at 
one point into sobs. "During the days in hiding, I felt I was dying every 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
 A physician who has been divorced three times, Nasrin writes with raw and 
unaccustomed candor about sex, orgasm, rape and family violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, she turned clerics en masse against her by publishing the 
novelette "Lajja" ("Shame"). In searing detail, the book relates how Hindu 
families in Bangladesh were beaten and had their homes and temples destroyed by 
angry Muslims avenging the 1992 razing of the Ayodhya mosque in India. In 
December, the government banned the book; the next month, it confiscated the 
author's passport.

BACKERS OF CRIME BILL TO PUSH FOR SHOWDOWN VOTE IN HOUSE; CONGRESS: CONCEDING 
THEY STILL LACK THE NUMBERS TO WIN, SPONSORS SAY GUN LOBBY PRESSURE IS 
STRIPPING SUPPORT. 'THIS IS GOING TO BE A NAIL-BITER,' SAYS ONE.

 Worried that congressional support for a ban on assault weapons may be 
slipping in the face of fierce opposition by the gun lobby, backers of the 
Clinton Administration's sweeping anti-crime bill said Wednesday they will seek 
a showdown vote on the House floor even though they lack the votes to assure 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
 In what he conceded was a high-risk gamble, Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), 
a leading sponsor of the crime bill, said Democratic leaders will bring the 
long-stalled legislation to the floor today in the hopes that a handful of key 
uncommitted votes will go their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a nail-biter. . . . We will win or lose by two or three 
votes," said Schumer, who conceded that supporters were still several votes 
short of the 218 needed to prevail on a procedural motion that opponents have 
been using to block the bill's passage. 
</P>
<P>
 With health care reform having its troubles, the crime bill has assumed 
increasing importance to lawmakers eager to demonstrate that Congress can pass 
legislation responsive to voters' concerns. The decision to force a vote on the 
Administration's comprehensive anti-crime initiative represents a dramatic 
turnaround in the Democratic leadership's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday morning, supporters were confident that they were "slowly closing 
the gap," in the words of one leadership aide, and they were reluctant to risk 
a floor fight until they could be assured of winning a procedural vote on a 
rule governing how the debate on the bill will be conducted. The rule must be 
adopted before the bill can be brought up for final passage. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the needed vote slowly being put together as President Clinton and 
other top Administration officials made a series of calls to wavering 
lawmakers, the Democratic leadership were shocked when several supporters 
defected from the President's side under heavy pressure from the National Rifle 
Assn. and other anti-gun control groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gaining converts but we're also losing some," conceded Schumer, who 
said that GOP leaders had joined with the NRA to pressure House Republicans 
into voting against the procedural motion. 
</P>
<P>
 While Schumer declined to be more specific, Democratic sources said that, as 
of Wednesday morning, they were still eight votes short of the 218 needed to 
win the procedure vote. While that represented a net gain of at least two votes 
from the day before, Schumer and other sponsors were clearly concerned that 
further delays would risk losing more votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get to the point where you have to roll the dice and take your chances 
and that's where we are now," said Schumer, who added that further delays would 
only "play into the hands of the NRA." 
</P>
<P>
 A small number of lawmakers, including some moderate Republicans and members 
of the Congressional Black Caucus, were refusing to commit themselves either 
way, making the outcome unpredictable until the vote takes place, Schumer 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Passed by a strong 285-141 margin in the House last April, the crime bill 
contains a record $33 billion to fund a variety of crime prevention and 
deterrent initiatives over the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
 On the deterrence side, it would expand the death penalty in federal cases, 
authorize nearly $9 billion in matching funds to help state and local 
governments hire 100,000 more police and provide more than $6 billion to fund 
new prison construction. It also contains the so-called three strikes and 
you're out provision imposing mandatory life sentences for repeat felony 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 On the prevention side, it would authorize $7.4 billion in new community 
programs designed to dissuade youngsters from joining street gangs by providing 
them with job training and after-school activities. It also would fund new drug 
treatment and prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the programs would be paid for by a special trust fund financed by the 
savings that are expected to accrue from a plan to cut the federal bureaucracy 
by more than 250,000 employees over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although liberal Democrats are unhappy with the death penalty provisions and 
Republicans have voiced scorn for what they see as wasteful spending on "social 
programs," the current controversy centers on the assault weapons ban that was 
included by the Senate when it passed its version of the crime bill, 95 to 4, 
last November. Prohibiting the sale and manufacture of 19 types of 
semiautomatic assault weapons, the ban was later added by the House to its bill 
by a 216-214 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome was hailed at the time by gun-control advocates as evidence that 
the influence of the once-formidable NRA finally was waning amid a public 
outcry over rising crime -- an issue that recent polls confirm is at the top of 
voters' concerns in the countdown to this November's midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But focusing on the procedural fight, the NRA has been mounting an intense 
lobbying counterattack to pressure about 80 Democrats who oppose gun controls 
to vote against the rule in the hope of stripping the weapons ban from the 
final bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going on right now is the legislative equivalent of the great shootout 
at the OK Corral," said one Democratic aide of the furious behind-the-scenes 
lobbying by the NRA on the one hand and the Clinton Administration on the 
other. "The folks who danced on the NRA's grave earlier this year were wrong. 
It's back and it's still a formidable lobby," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NRA has a lot of people scared up here," agreed Rep. Ronald D. Coleman 
(D-Tex.). "Anybody that denies that is lying to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating this political calculus is the fact that members of the Black 
Caucus, which supported the original bill, threatened to vote against it after 
provisions intended to help prevent racial bias in death sentencing were 
dropped when the House bill was reconciled with the Senate's version. 
</P>
<P>
 A leadership source indicated Wednesday that the conservative Democrats were 
equally split, with about 40 resisting Clinton's attempts to persuade them to 
support the rule. But he added that Clinton was gaining support from the Black 
Caucus as its 37 Democratic members "begin to realize that their pique over the 
death penalty provisions is only helping the NRA." 
</P>
<P>
 One caucus member, Rep. Mel Reynolds (D-Ill.), said he was persuaded to change 
sides because of the "perverse" way in which the NRA had associated itself with 
the Black Caucus on the rules fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to vote against the rule because the racial justice provisions 
were dropped," Reynolds said, brandishing one of several semiautomatic weapons 
displayed at a news conference. "But now I am going to vote for it because I 
will do nothing to help the NRA continue the madness on our streets."

STARR TO 'BUILD UPON' FISKE PROBE; INVESTIGATION: NEW WHITEWATER COUNSEL 
REJECTS DEMANDS THAT HE STEP ASIDE. CLINTON'S LAWYERS SEEK DELAY OR DISMISSAL 
OF HARASSMENT SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Turning aside Democratic demands that he step down as the newly appointed 
Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr said Wednesday that he plans 
to render an "independent judgment" on all matters covered by the wide-ranging 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr said he will "build upon" the investigation done by his predecessor, 
Robert B. Fiske Jr., but pointedly refused to say that he would accept Fiske's 
conclusions on parts of the inquiry already completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accept this assignment with a firm commitment to fairness, thoroughness, 
dispatch and professionalism," Starr said in a written statement, issued a day 
after he met in Little Rock, Ark., with Fiske, the outside prosecutor named by 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and then replaced in a surprise move by a special panel 
of judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, President Clinton's lawyers filed a motion in federal court in 
Little Rock, seeking the dismissal or delay of the sexual-harassment suit 
brought in May by former Arkansas state employee Paula Corbin Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 In documents supporting the motion, Clinton's chief private attorney, Robert 
S. Bennett, declared that a sitting President must be immune from civil damage 
suits because they would impair his ability to carry out the unique 
responsibilities of the office. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that Jones can refile her suit after Clinton leaves office without 
suffering any legal or financial harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "To allow such a suit to go forward will establish a novel and dangerous 
precedent that will do great damage to the institution of the presidency and 
will enable those seeking to promote personal or political agendas to place 
their own selfish interests above those of the American people," Bennett said 
in a statement accompanying the legal motion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the legal papers submitted to U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, 
Bennett said Jones' suit is motivated by political animosity toward Clinton and 
hope for financial gain. He said proceedings involving Clinton's co-defendant, 
Arkansas state trooper Danny Ferguson, also should be delayed until Clinton 
leaves office because Ferguson's trial would necessarily involve time-consuming 
testimony by the President. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bennett said that by claiming temporary immunity, he was not arguing that 
Clinton or any other President is not subject to the rule of law, "but only 
that a particular remedy -- money damages -- is not immediately available to 
the plaintiff." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett also said the burden of responding to suits like Jones' -- and the 
others it might inspire -- would be intolerable. "To understand what a 
disruption such suits could be, one need only imagine a President spending days 
in deposition, weeks in pretrial preparation with lawyers and weeks at trial, 
while the urgent business of the nation -- foreign, domestic, civilian and 
military -- awaited the chief executive's attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph L. Cammarata, one of Jones' attorneys, assailed the immunity argument 
as "an unprecedented claim by Mr. Clinton to place himself above the law for 
his private acts under the guise of protecting the office of President." 
</P>
<P>
 He called it a "desperate attempt" to avoid dealing with the merits of the 
case and to delay any airing of the facts until after he has left office. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' attorneys have 11 days to answer Clinton's immunity argument, although 
it is expected that they will be granted an extension to prepare their 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Justice Department, where a brief on the question of presidential 
immunity is being prepared by Solicitor General Drew S. Days III and his staff, 
chief spokesman Carl Stern said a decision on whether and what to file with the 
court will be made in the next several days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the judgment is made that this is the kind of question in which the 
government has historically presented its view, we probably would file without 
an invitation" by the judge to do so, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern would not discuss any details of the government's likely position, but 
it is understood to concur that the President must be allowed at least 
temporary relief from facing civil suits while in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr issued a one-page statement about his plans for the Whitewater inquiry 
following four hours of meetings in Little Rock with Fiske and his top aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr said he had told members of Fiske's staff that he hoped many of them 
would stay on. "I am keenly aware of the considerable knowledge they have 
developed over recent months about these matters," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative Republican critics had called for the replacement of Fiske, 
questioning the thoroughness and impartiality of his investigation. They 
particularly objected to his conclusion that Treasury Department officials had 
not violated the law by briefing the White House on a federal investigation of 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, an Arkansas thrift that figures prominently in 
the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Democrats -- led by Bennett -- questioned Starr's appointment, saying 
that the former top Justice Department official, a Republican, is tainted by 
his political activities and his public opposition to presidential immunity in 
the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater Development Corp., an Ozarks real estate project, was owned jointly 
then-Gov. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and James B. McDougal, 
who also owned Madison Guaranty. The thrift was seized by federal regulators in 
1989. Starr will try to determine whether the Whitewater project caused losses 
at Madison Guaranty or whether federally insured deposits from the thrift were 
siphoned off to benefit Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, nine Senate Republicans called for the dismissal of 
three Treasury Department officials who testified last week about White 
House-Treasury meetings on the investigation of Madison Guaranty by the 
Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, senior Republican on the Senate Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, said the three are Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Roger Altman, Counsel Jean Hanson and Joshua L. Steiner, chief of 
staff to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Bentsen, D'Amato and other Republicans who took part in the 
hearings wrote: "By their actions, these officials have brought dishonor on 
your office. We believe their continued service at Treasury cannot be 
productive. They have irretrievably lost the confidence of this committee." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House rejected the demand, saying that it was politically motivated. 
"We simply don't agree with Sen. D'Amato on this point," White House Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, four conservative groups delivered 26,000 petition signatures 
to the House Judiciary Committee demanding hearings on Clinton's impeachment. 
Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, said that impeachment is 
warranted because of the White House's "massive cover-up" in connection with 
the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 He was joined at a news conference by officials of the Citizens Committee for 
the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, the Conservative Campaign Fund and Citizens 
United in Seeking Impeachment.

CONGRESS WAS INFORMED ABOUT SPY OFFICE, CIA SAYS; INTELLIGENCE: BUT OFFICIALS 
ADMIT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN MORE SPECIFIC. COST OF $310-MILLION COMPLEX WAS 
OBSCURED IN AN OPERATING BUDGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Responding to congressional criticism, U.S. intelligence officials insisted 
Wednesday they had properly informed lawmakers about the cost of a $310-million 
headquarters for the secret National Reconnaissance Office, the government 
agency that supervises the nation's spy satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 But the intelligence officials also conceded they could have done better. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare open hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, officials of 
the satellite office and CIA Director R. James Woolsey produced notebooks full 
of previously classified documents showing that the agencies had given the 
Senate panel information about the four-building complex near Dulles 
International Airport in Northern Virginia. A May, 1992, briefing paper broke 
down the year-by-year cost of the facility and estimated the total price tag at 
$309 million. 
</P>
<P>
 National Reconnaissance Director Jeff Harris said his agency did not 
intentionally conceal from Congress the existence or the cost of the project -- 
which was included as part of the office's base-line operating budget instead 
of as a separate item. Harris said his office would be more open in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that the agency had been "negligent" in the budget process 
when it failed to highlight the project as a special new expense. Construction 
of the project, which began in 1990, was declassified by President Clinton on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Intelligence agency documents, including excerpts from budget briefings by 
intelligence officials for committee staff members, laid out plans to 
consolidate National Reconnaissance operations, which are scattered in military 
bases across the country, in one permanent headquarters to be occupied starting 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged lawmakers, who insisted that they had been kept in the dark about the 
68-acre office complex, said a "failure to communicate" among the CIA, the 
satellite office and congressional staffs is symptomatic of a lingering Cold 
War-era mentality in the intelligence community that led spy agencies to resist 
full disclosure of their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play the most stupid games in the intelligence community of any government 
in the world," said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), chairman of the committee, said intelligence 
officials had barely mentioned the complex, even in closed, classified 
testimony, since the National Reconnaissance Office started planning it in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini and other critics said the agency should find additional ways to 
trim costs in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey pledged to form a panel to look into ways the agency could improve the 
project's cost-effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,900 employees and 1,000 defense contract workers are expected to work 
at the 1-million-square-foot headquarters, which can house 3,500 people. When 
the complex opens, other Washington-area offices of the agency will be closed 
and hundreds of employees will be relocated from offices across the country, 
including Los Angeles, Deputy Director Jimmie Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency purchased the large tract of land for $23.9 million in 1990 and 
officials of the agency said they expanded blueprints for the office complex 
from two six-story buildings to four by late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of contractors from Southern California companies and experts from 
two affiliated firms -- Aerospace Corp., a federally funded research and 
development firm, and the Air Force Space and Missile System Center at Los 
Angeles Air Force Base -- are expected to relocate to offices in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Reconnaissance budget is estimated to be about $7 billion. The 
agency's chief functions include bidding out multibillion-dollar contracts to 
build imaging and eavesdropping satellites and disseminating information to 
other intelligence agencies for analysis.

FEMALE CADET MUST UNDERGO HEAD-SHAVE

<P>
 A federal judge Wednesday turned down Shannon Faulkner's second request to be 
spared the shaved-head haircut that all cadets receive when they enter The 
Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck, who ruled earlier that the military 
school's all-male admissions policy was unconstitutional, had said Faulkner 
would have to get the "buzz cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorneys and the U.S. Justice Department asked him to reconsider, arguing 
that she should be given a short bob like women in the military receive. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Faulkner said she fought the haircut order to benefit women 
who may follow her at The Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have said before I will have my head shaved," she said. She said she won't 
like it, but "I'm not planning on backing out. I have never, ever thought of 
backing out." 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner is to become the first woman to enroll in the corps Monday, although 
the state military school has asked a federal appeals court to keep her out.

HOUSE OKS BILL EXTENDING LABOR RIGHTS TO CONGRESSIONAL WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. COOPER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to political pressure from radio talk-show hosts, Ross Perot 
supporters and freshman lawmakers, the House on Wednesday approved bipartisan 
legislation that would give employees of Congress the same rights under labor 
laws as workers in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 35,000 employees of Congress and its support agencies would get the 
legal right to organize unions, file discrimination lawsuits and work in safe 
environments under legislation to fully apply 10 labor laws to the legislative 
branch.The House passed the bill, 427 to 4, and sent it to the Senate, where 
supporters expect passage despite resistance from some senior members. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's good for the country ought to be good for the government," declared 
Rep. Dick Swett (D-N.H.), who co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Christopher Shays 
(R-Conn.). 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has at least partially exempted itself from the 10 laws -- including 
the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Occupational 
Safety and Health Act of 1970 -- to avoid politically inspired enforcement 
actions from executive-branch agencies in violation of the constitutional 
separation of powers. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics argue that the exemptions symbolize Congress' arrogance and 
explain its alleged insensitivity to regulatory burdens imposed on business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swett-Shays bill would skirt the separation-of-powers issue by putting 
enforcement in the hands of a new Office of Compliance and the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Aggrieved employees could file lawsuits directly in federal district court or, 
after a three-step administration procedure, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit here. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, House employees have no such recourse in the courts, but Senate 
employees can sue under anti-discrimination laws.

SETTLEMENT OUTLINED IN ALABAMA SCHOOL BIAS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department and school board attorneys reached a preliminary 
agreement Wednesday that could settle a racial discrimination complaint against 
this town's school system, and federal arson investigators determined that a 
weekend blaze that destroyed the local high school was intentionally set. 
</P>
<P>
 Deval Patrick, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, said 
the government reached the agreement partly because of the Monday reassignment 
of Principal Hulond Humphries, who touched off a furor by threatening to cancel 
the spring prom if interracial couples planned to attend. Patrick said the 
school board showed "a commitment to resolve faculty desegregation issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick referred in part to the board's decision to form a faculty committee 
-- half black, half white -- to hear grievances of parents and students and 
coordinate with school officials to resolve them. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing set for today on the department's motion that Humphries be removed 
as principal pending trial was canceled by U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson 
under the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial is still set for October on the Justice Department's broader claims of 
racial discrimination in the school system. Attorneys for both sides plan 
further discussions in an attempt to avoid a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries, reassigned to an office job overseeing the rebuilding of the 
school, was replaced by a white principal and a black assistant principal. The 
other assistant principal is white. 
</P>
<P>
 The 680-student school is about 38% black. 
</P>
<P>
 State Fire Marshal John Robison said a draft report from a special federal 
arson investigation team determined that the weekend fire at Randolph County 
High School was intentionally set. He said authorities had no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, a tearful Humphries broke his public silence. Cheered by 
supporters, he read a statement but avoided reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been difficult to stand back and listen to allegations against me 
without responding," he said. "However, I kept my silence strictly on the 
advice of my attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries denied that he hit a black cameraman who was filming the burning 
school. And he said he was sorry if the cameraman, Bill Gill of WVTM-TV in 
Birmingham, was injured when confronted early Saturday while filming Humphries 
during the effort to put out the fire. Gill, who is black, claims the white 
principal led others who knocked him to the ground. He said he would file a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Mr. Gill knows, I never touched him. I never touched his camera," 
Humphries said. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to say anything about ReVonda Bowen, a mixed-race student who 
claimed he told her that her parents made "a mistake" in having her. He said 
the matter could still be litigated, although Bowen received $25,000 toward her 
college education in a settlement from the school board's insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries, 55, said it was difficult to give up the job of principal he had 
held for a quarter-century but felt it was best for his family and the 
community.

IRANIAN DIPLOMATS SOUGHT IN ARGENTINE CAR-BOMBING

<P>
 Argentina has issued international arrest warrants for four Iranian diplomats 
in connection with the car-bombing of a Jewish community center that killed 
nearly 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Iranian Ambassador Hadi Soleimanpour arrived at the Argentine Foreign Ministry 
on Wednesday to be notified that a worldwide hunt is on for the four 
officials.The warrants were issued largely on the basis of testimony from a 
disaffected Iranian under Venezuelan custody. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carlos Saul Menem has threatened to expel Soleimanpour for his 
country's alleged role in the July 18 blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran has denied any involvement in the attack that razed the headquarters of 
Argentina's main Jewish groups. In a letter Wednesday to the Argentine charge 
d'affaires in Tehran, Iran said it "registers its strong protest against 
defaming Iranian dignitaries and officials."

GERMAN COURT CHASTISED FOR GIVING EXTREMIST SLAP ON WRIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The German government, media and even judges on Wednesday condemned a regional 
court for adulating a radical rightist leader after handing him a light 
sentence for denying that the Holocaust ever occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the German government "regrets . . 
. the bad signals stemming from the verdict" Tuesday by the Mannheim court, 
while Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger called the decision 
"a slap in the face to all victims of the Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mannheim court explained that it had given Guenter Deckert, the head of 
the extreme rightist National Democratic Party, a light sentence for inciting 
racial hatred last June because he had no prior criminal record and was a 
"family father whose crime in principle consisted of expressing an opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charged that using such mild language to describe Deckert and the 
"Auschwitz lie" would encourage the small but violent groups of neo-Nazis who 
have lashed out at foreigners and Jews since German reunification in 1990. 
About 30 people, most of them Turks, have been killed in neo-Nazi attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy erupted even as police moved to block rightist rallies planned 
for the coming weekend to mark the anniversary of the death of Rudolf Hess, 
Hitler's deputy who hanged himself in prison in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The public television network ZDF called the Mannheim verdict "a scandal" and, 
in an unusual criticism of one judge by another, Viktor Weber, deputy chairman 
of the Assn. of German Judges, said the decision was incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Holocaust is a historical fact that you cannot deny," Weber said on 
television. "You must accept what an independent court has ruled, but you do 
not have to agree with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has been controversial in Germany and internationally from the 
outset. 
</P>
<P>
 Deckert, a former schoolteacher, was convicted of inciting hatred in 1991 
after organizing a lecture by Fred Leuchter, an American neo-Nazi and prison 
gas-chamber designer. He wrongly claims that Auschwitz never had gas chambers 
and, therefore, that the killing of 6 million Jews never took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Deckert translated Leuchter's speech into German and sold tapes of it. It is 
illegal in Germany to wear a swastika, give the Nazi salute or spread Nazi 
literature, and Deckert received a one-year suspended sentence and a fine of 
about $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's highest appeals court considered the case but sent it back to the 
Mannheim court last March. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the Mannheim court gave Deckert the same light sentence. A 65-page 
explanation of the decision was published Tuesday.

MAN REPORTEDLY KILLS WIFE, 2 SONS BEFORE SHOOTING SELF; VIOLENCE: RELATIVES SAY 
HE WAS TROUBLED BY MARITAL PROBLEMS, UNEMPLOYMENT. HE IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who family members said was troubled by marital problems and his 
inability to find work allegedly shot and killed his wife and two sons before 
critically wounding himself Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Brunolt, a 45-year-old unemployed electrician, was arrested and booked 
on suspicion of murder at Riverside Community Hospital, where he was in 
critical but stable condition with a gunshot wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunolt's wife, Graciela, believed to be in her 30s, and his sons, Martin Jr., 
about 10, and Matthew, about 6, were slain. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the Brunolts were arguing before the shooting but do not 
know what sparked the fight, Lohman said. The two did not have a history of 
domestic violence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunolt's mother, Marlene Chicoine, said her son and daughter-in-law had faced 
increasing job and family-related problems in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything just pounded down on them -- the loss of work, the problems they 
were having with their marriage," she said after visiting her son in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicoine said she believes her son will never come to grips with the loss of 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was praying that he wouldn't make it," she tearfully told a reporter. "I 
love him so much I was praying he wouldn't make it because he loved his sons 
and he loved his wife so much." 
</P>
<P>
 The carnage at the Brunolt's single-story home on normally quiet Sea Biscuit 
Street was discovered shortly after midnight by authorities responding to a 
report of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies found Brunolt staggering on the front lawn with an apparently 
self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, Riverside County Sheriff's spokesman 
Mark Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the 1,100-square-foot home, they found the bodies of his wife and sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies recovered a 9-millimeter handgun from the house and believed it was 
the weapon used in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was reported by a live-in housekeeper, who heard the gunshots and 
walked to a nearby fire station to get help, Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The housekeeper, who was not injured, could not be located for questioning 
later Wednesday, Lohman said.

SENATOR'S AIDE MISTAKENLY SHOT BY SPOUSE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karin Miranda Pipkin, a state Senate aide, remained in critical condition 
Wednesday after being shot six times by her husband, a former high-ranking 
Wilson Administration official who mistakenly took her for an intruder, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's husband, political consultant Robert Pipkin, was awakened by the 
burglar alarm in the second-story bedroom of the couple's East Sacramento home 
about 11 p.m. Tuesday, said Michael Heenan, a Sacramento police 
spokesman.Pipkin found nothing amiss, reset the alarm and went to the bathroom. 
But he did not know that his wife, who is chief of staff for Sen. Tom Campbell 
(R-Stanford), apparently also had been awakened and had gone downstairs, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still thinking his wife was in bed, Robert Pipkin, who had been a high-ranking 
official in the state Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, heard the 
alarm again, retrieved his 9-millimeter handgun and telephoned 911. Then, 
police said, he heard someone walking upstairs and saw the bedroom door open. 
Afraid to turn on the lights or make any noise, Robert Pipkin started shooting, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karin Pipkin, 39, was taken to UC Davis Medical Center. She is expected to 
survive the shooting, which police regard as an accident.

LAS VEGAS ARMORED TRUCK DRIVER SOUGHT IN APPARENT THEFT OF $1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities are searching for a 23-year-old armored truck driver and her 
boyfriend after the driver disappeared with $1 million in cash. The heist was 
the third involving an armored truck in Las Vegas in the past 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were searching for Misty Leann Smith, a Brinks employee since April 1, 
and her boyfriend, Anthony Frisco, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to eliminate foul play at this time, but all indications 
point to an embezzlement theft by Misty and her boyfriend," Las Vegas Metro 
Police Lt. Mike Hawkins said Wednesday. "The speculation is that they have left 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
 The armored truck was found abandoned Tuesday night in an empty unit of a 
warehouse complex a short distance from where the vehicle disappeared hours 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins said "a few thousand dollars, mostly in change," was found inside the 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins said authorities believe that the crime is an embezzlement because 
there were no signs of foul play or a struggle in the armored truck and because 
of "other indicators that we can't go into now." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was last seen by another Brinks guard inside the truck minutes before 
the disappearance, which took place just before noon Tuesday.

FIREFIGHTERS GAIN ON GOLD COUNTRY BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After evacuating 550 young campers in the middle of the night, firefighters 
Wednesday appeared to be gaining control of a 600-acre fire that started along 
a creek bed near the little Gold Country town of Columbia in Tuolumne County. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by thick, dry brush and fallen trees, the fire was whipped by winds to 
the northeast, threatening Cedar Ridge, a subdivision of several hundred homes 
where an estimated 1,200 residents were evacuated as a precaution. An 
additional 600 homes scattered through the area could be in jeopardy, said 
firefighter Michael Tennyson. 
</P>
<P>
 By midday, the blaze was 20% contained, Tennyson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The expected containment time is still unknown," he said late Wednesday. 
"They're having trouble with the steep terrain, the heavy fuel of brush and 
fallen trees, and the poor access. These are mostly dirt roads into the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennyson said 984 firefighters were on the scene, including crews from the 
Stanislaus National Forest and the California Department of Forestry. The area 
of the burn straddles state, federal and privately owned land. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Wednesday, the fire had claimed no lives or homes, but there were 
two reports of injuries, Tennyson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire looks like it is calming down," said Betsy Eisenhower of the 
Tuolumne County Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Evacuees were relocated to the Mother Lode Fairgrounds in the town of Sonora, 
where Red Cross workers provided assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Juanita Keith, the operations manager of the Marble Quarry RV Park five miles 
west of the blaze, told how a co-worker, Laurie Starkweather, was ordered out 
of her house late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got the kids and her pets out last night. She's got quite a menagerie up 
there, a pygmy goat, a pot-bellied pig and cats and dogs. But today (the 
Sheriff's Department) told her she had to get out herself, no ifs, ands or 
buts." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith said that at that point the flames were no more than 30 feet from the 
Starkweather house. 
</P>
<P>
 First spotted along Five Mile Creek, the blaze is the latest in a series that 
have struck the heavily vegetated terrain of drought-stricken Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire crews and equipment that successfully beat back a series of fires in the 
Kelsey-Placerville area were being redeployed to fight the blaze near Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Of immediate concern were 450 youngsters attending church camp at Old Oak 
Ranch and 100 others at the Regional Learning Center operated by the Clovis 
Unified School District. By Wednesday most of the campers had been retrieved by 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Columbia, about five miles away from blaze, printer Robert Noler, 61, an 
employee of the Columbia Gazette visitors' guide, said plumes of smoke were 
clearly visible all day as fire crews and equipment rumbled through the small 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a sight to see those big Huey helicopters roaring over town, 
headed for the blaze, with their loads of water," Noler said. "More excitement 
around here than we've seen in years."

MORNING BRIEFING: TO SIGN PLAYER, SOCCER CLUB APPEALS TO A BASIC INSTINCT 
</P>

<P>
 How did the Italian league club Fiorentina steal Brazilian World Cup defender 
Marcio Santos from England's Tottenham Hotspur, which was on the brink of 
signing Santos? 
</P>
<P>
 By promising him a date with movie siren Sharon Stone, of all people, if you 
believe a report in the British tabloid Sunday Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amazing promise has been written into his two-year contract by Italian 
club President Vitorio Checci-Gori, who once beat up a referee and linesman 
after being sent off in a charity match," the Mirror wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is well connected in the movie industry, having inherited a major film 
production company in Rome from his father." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the tabloid quotes an unnamed Tottenham insider: "We offered Santos a 
good deal, but we could not match Fiorentina -- and no wonder!" 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What is the most common jersey number worn by Pro Football Hall 
of Fame inductees? 
</P>
<P>
 And stay out: Don't look for Washington Post columnist Johnette Howard to join 
the chorus of sportswriters bemoaning the impending baseball strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say let 'em walk," Howard wrote. "And don't let the door smack their 
stadium seat cushions on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot wrong with baseball even before the strike began to loom. The 
games move like glaciers. The expansion boom to 28 teams has nurtured whole new 
genres of big leaguers -- the rag-arm outfielders who can't hit the cutoff man, 
the rag-arm pitchers who can't string together three outs in a row, the 
power-hitting hulks who'd have the range of a bird bath if they had to play the 
field, the long-toothed veteran who'd hang on forever if the other guys didn't 
kid him unmercifully about those boxes of Depends in his locker." 
</P>
<P>
 Name game: When Dave Otto of the Chicago Cubs and Robb Nen of the Florida 
Marlins pitched in the same game last week, it marked the first time in 
baseball history that two players with palindromic last names pitched in the 
same game. 
</P>
<P>
 A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forward and backward. 
</P>
<P>
 According to research by the Marlin public relations staff, there have been 
six other palindromic players in the major leagues: Truck Hannah, Toby Harrah, 
Eddie Kazak, Johnny Reder, Mark Salas and Dick Nen (Robb's father). 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Eight Hall of Fame players wore No. 16 at one point during 
their NFL careers -- George Blanda, Len Dawson, Frank Gifford, Ed Healey, 
George Musso, Arnie Herber, Walt Kiesling and Bronko Nagurski. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Dal Maxvill, general manager of the St. Louis Cardinals: "Did you 
really believe at all in spring training that we'd be this bad? I must be the 
dumbest guy in the world. I had no clue this bunch would be like this." TIM

DISARCINA'S KEY SINGLE GIVES ANGELS A VICTORY; BASEBALL: SHORTSTOP'S 
BASES-LOADED HIT WITH ONE OUT IN THE NINTH LIFTS CALIFORNIA PAST KANSAS CITY, 
2-1, IN FINAL GAME FOR TEAM BEFORE STRIKE DEADLINE.

<P>
 It was as if they were giddy teen-agers on the last day of school Wednesday, 
cleaning out their lockers, talking about their vacations, and exchanging phone 
numbers for summer get-togethers. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing missing was yearbook signings, but the clubhouse boys 
substituted autographed baseballs for yearbooks, even passing out "On Strike" 
T-shirts, knowing they all may never be together again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, playing what could be their final game of the season, defeated the 
Kansas City Royals, 2-1, on Gary DiSarcina's one-out, bases-loaded single in 
the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 19,605 at Anaheim Stadium, sensing it was the final game, 
remained on their feet at the game's conclusion, imploring the players to keep 
playing this season. They began chanting, "'No strike. No strike. No strike," 
during the seventh-inning stretch, and stopped long enough to accept souvenirs 
thrown into the stands by the Angel players at the game's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson, who stole second base in the second inning for his first steal 
since Sept. 27, 1990, even took a memento for himself, pulling out the 
second-base bag on his way to the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go out in style," Jackson said, "and I did that. Who knows if 
I'll be playing again? If I don't, I want to remember this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, once inside the Angel clubhouse, there was little emotion. The players 
rushed off the field, packed their final belongings, and took off. 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Chad Curtis hurriedly caught a red-eye flight to Michigan, 
making a bet with Jackson who will catch the most fish during the strike. 
Reliever Joe Grahe already had his fishing reels, saying he'll be deep-sea 
fishing in the Atlantic by the weekend. Chuck Finley (10-10) who pitched a 
complete-game victory, is heading to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fan who walked into the stadium, carrying the sign: "Mom, Send Money 
to the Pension Fund. Don't strike," simply walked off in silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an ugly feeling," Angel infielder Rex Hudler said. "It's like a big dark 
cloud coming in, and it carries a tremendous thunderhead. There's nasty energy 
in those big thunderheads, and it's carrying a plague. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me call Jack (Howell) in Japan and say, 'Jack, it's a good thing 
you're still in Japan. You wouldn't want to be here for this. Man, I wish I was 
still there with you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While Hudler was winning a World Series in Japan last season, he has been 
stuck this year with the Angels (47-68), who are in last place with the 
second-worst record in the major leagues. The only redeeming aspect of Friday's 
scheduled strike is that it should at least prevent the Angels from losing 100 
games for the first time in their franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be lying to say I wasn't looking forward to this vacation," Angel second 
baseman Harold Reynolds said. "The sad thing is all of the little people that 
get hurt by this. But the way this season has gone for us, hey, who wouldn't 
look forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel left fielder Jim Edmonds, who was benched Wednesday because of his 
lackadaisical play Tuesday: "I can't wait to get out of here. It couldn't come 
soon enough. Things stink around here right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel owner Gene Autry certainly acted as if this was the season's final game, 
strolling into the clubhouse before the game, and giving his annual season 
farewell speech: 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you boys for the season. I know you tried to win, but it just didn't 
work out. If I don't see you again until next spring, have a good winter." 
</P>
<P>
 Said one Angel: "At least he didn't give the speech he gave a couple of years 
ago. That's when he said, 'I'll be seeing some of you boys next spring, and 
some of you I won't.' 
</P>
<P>
 "You know something, he was right."

 The Angel players publicly told reporters Wednesday that they remain 
optimistic that there will be a last-minute settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, they believe the season is over, and even began turning in their 
ballots for the team's most valuable player, selecting designated hitter Chili 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels still have a tentative charter flight scheduled to leave Ontario 
Airport at 11:30 p.m. today, but considering that talks broke off Wednesday, 
Mark Langston, player representative, said no one is planning to show up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody understands what's going on," Langston said, "and we realize this 
could be it. Optimistically, we're looking forward to getting things settled, 
but then again, we're prepared for the long haul."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most eye-catching --  
</P>
<P>
 and deceiving --  
</P>
<P>
 billboards in Southern California say, "The Rams Are Moving." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pictured are a football, a Ram helmet and a Ram traveling bag. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean the team already has made a decision to move to, say, St. Louis 
or Baltimore? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Not really. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is supposed to be an advertisement for the move of the Rams -- and the rest 
of the NFC -- from CBS to Fox-TV this season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As of now, though, there is no mention of the network. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We have no comment, but watch those boards," said Tony Seiniger, president of 
the advertising agency retained by Fox Sports. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A Ram spokesperson said team executives are "confused" by the billboards. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Ram rookie candidates who are making a good impression is DeMarco Farr, 
a defensive tackle from Washington. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Farr wasn't drafted primarily because he is a mere 6-feet-1, 270 pounds. He 
was signed by the Rams as a free agent after being voted Pacific 10 defensive 
player of the year by the conference's offensive players. He made four tackles 
during limited playing time against Green Bay in Saturday's exhibition game. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Why would Jamir Miller, the linebacker from UCLA who is still unsigned after 
being drafted 10th overall by the Arizona Cardinals, ever want to get on the 
bad side of Buddy Ryan?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the long season finally about to grind to a halt, it is time to predict 
the winners of the major league baseball awards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 American League most valuable player -- Frank Thomas, Chicago; Cy Young Award 
-- Jimmy Key, New York; manager of the year -- Buck Showalter, New York; rookie 
of the year -- Bob Hamelin, Kansas City; comeback player of the year -- David 
Cone, Kansas City. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 National League most valuable player -- Jeff Bagwell, Houston; Cy Young Award 
-- Greg Maddux, Atlanta; manager of the year -- Felipe Alou, Montreal; rookie 
of the year -- Raul Mondesi, Dodgers; comeback player of the year -- Tim 
Wallach, Dodgers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Murray has driven in at least 75 runs for the 18th consecutive year, one 
short of Hank Aaron's record. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lasorda should be grateful that he isn't managing in Brazil, where Carlos 
Alberto Parreira quit as coach of Brazil's World Cup championship team a couple 
of weeks after constantly being second-guessed. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fox-TV couldn't have asked for better timing for its first NFL exhibition 
telecast -- Denver at San Francisco Friday, what looms as the first day of the 
baseball strike. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Malone is a better ESPN correspondent than he was an NFL quarterback. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux has signed to play a featured role in an episode of the TV 
series, "Baywatch," this season. He will play, of all things, a jockey 
recovering from an injury. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas isn't in the National Racing Hall of Fame because he won't be 
eligible until he completes his 25th year as a thoroughbred trainer in 2000. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Fred Couples, who has recovered completely from his back injury and won 
the Buick Open last week, can give the United States a major title in the 
year's last chance, the PGA Championship starting today at Tulsa, Okla. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among the golfers to watch in the Inner-City Junior Championships today and 
Friday at the Chester Washington course is Randall Hunt, 15, of Paramount. He's 
an improving two-handicapper who had a B+ academic average in his freshman year 
at Valley Christian High. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Ruelas of Sylmar and Zack Padilla of Azusa will fight in separate 
12-round bouts on Top Rank's pay-per-view TV card from Hong Kong on Oct. 22. 
The main event will be the heavyweight match everyone has been clamoring for, 
Herbie Hide vs. Tommy Morrison. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A UCLA pass-catch combination of the future could be Steve Buck to Jim 
McElroy. Buck, a quarterback from Alta Loma High, and McElroy, a wide receiver 
from Washington High, began workouts with the rest of the Bruins' incoming 
freshmen Wednesday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Center Avondre Jones' transfer from USC to Chaffey College means he will be 
playing basketball next season for a Tarkanian -- George Tarkanian, youngest 
son of Jerry and coach of the two-year school in Rancho Cucamonga. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh Penguin wing Luc Robitaille hasn't cut all his Southern California 
ties yet. He will be the host of a celebrity hockey game on Aug. 27 at the 
Forum that will benefit the T.J. Martell Foundation and Neil Bogart Memorial 
Fund at Children's Hospital. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Speculation is growing about a strike -- an NHL strike this season.

NAVRATILOVA HAS TO STRUGGLE AGAINST AN UNDAUNTED FOE; TENNIS: DECHAUME-BALLERET 
PUTS UP A FIGHT BEFORE LOSING IN SECOND ROUND AT MANHATTAN BEACH, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 
(7-4). 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Alexia Dechaume-Balleret of Monaco is never going to match Martina 
Navratilova's accomplishments.  
</P>
<P>
 But none of that mattered Wednesday night during the second round of the 
Virginia Slims of Los Angeles in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Dechaume-Balleret, one of the faceless names on the women's tennis tour, 
elevated her game to new heights in losing to second-seeded Navratilova in a 
dramatic three-set tiebreaker before 5,724 at the Manhattan Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 84 Dechaume-Balleret fell behind 4-0 in the third set, and looked as if 
she would quickly disappear but rallied before losing, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to play some great tennis to win that match," Navratilova said. "I 
opened the door for her and she certainly slammed it open." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not supposed to start like this for Navratilova, 37, playing in her 
first match since losing the Wimbledon final to Conchita Martinez last month. 
Navratilova, who has won 18 Grand Slam singles titles, is playing her final 
season after 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dechaume-Balleret, 24, started the year ranked 350th, and although she is 
slowly moving up the rankings, she has done little to gain attention. She 
reached the fourth round of the French Open but had to qualify to play at 
Wimbledon. She lost in the second round at the All England Tennis Lawn Club to 
Kristie Boogert of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 She lost to top-ranked Steffi Graf in the second round of the Toshiba Classic 
in Carlsbad last week, 6-0, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 So, there was little indication that Dechaume-Balleret, who did not play last 
year because of a wrist injury, was a threat to spoil Navratilova's farewell to 
Los Angeles. Navratilova, after all, has won the Manhattan Beach tournament 
eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dechaume-Balleret was undaunted. By mixing her shots and remaining poised, 
she turned a routine outing into a eventful match. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I was so nervous. . . . I was a little tight," Dechaume-Balleret 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident. Navratilova had little difficulty controlling the first set 
with a tough serve-and-volley game. But Dechaume-Balleret got into the match by 
forcing Navratilova to stay on the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
 And somewhere along the way, she regained confidence. So, when trailing 4-0 in 
the third, Dechaume-Balleret did not quit. Instead, she zeroed in on the lines 
and started hitting them. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little Navratilova could do but shrug her shoulders at some of those 
pinpoint shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of the third set, it was difficult to pass her," 
Dechaume-Balleret said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she ran down a drop volley and passed Navratilova to close to 4-2, 
she pumped her fist, showing emotion for the first time during the match. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point, Navratilova was in a fight. Even when she had match point on 
Dechaume-Balleret's serve in the 10th game, it was a battle. Dechaume-Balleret 
held. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova did not take control of the tiebreaker until the eighth point when 
she lunged at a deep ball and hit it a cross-court winner. That seemed to spell 
the end for Dechaume-Balleret. Navratilova won the next three points to 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure she doesn't play like this very often," Navratilova said. "If she 
did, she would be ranked higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 No. 70 Elena Likhovtseva of Kazakhstan defeated No. 48 Pam Shriver, 6-0, 3-6, 
7-5, after trailing in the third set, 3-1. Shriver won seven of eight games at 
the end of the second set and the beginning of the third, but Likhovtseva, 18, 
did not fold. "I felt very close to taking control in the third, but I 
couldn't," Shriver said. "She returns so well it put pressure on me." 
</P>
<P>
 When Shriver tied the score, 5-5, on consecutive points, Likhovtseva answered 
with four in a row to take a 6-5 lead. Then she displayed her tough return in 
the 12th game. Shriver took a 40-30 lead on an ace, but Likhovtseva won the 
next three points to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Likhovtseva will face top-seeded Conchita Martinez in the third round.

 Boris Becker needed a first-set tiebreaker to get used to the court, then put 
away Cristiano Caratti of Italy, 7-6 (10-8), 6-3 Wednesday night in a 
second-round match in the $1.72-million ATP Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started off badly," said Becker, seeded eighth."The court was so fast, the 
ball was almost skidding. It took me about 25 minutes to get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, top-seeded Sergi Bruguera needed three sets to defeat Russian Andrei 
Cherkasov, 6-1, 2-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish clay specialist, a three-time winner on that surface this year, 
inherited the top seeding when No. 1-ranked Pete Sampras withdrew late last 
week because of tendinitis in his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden eliminated countryman Henrik Holm, 6-3, 
6-2, avenging a loss to Holm in the first round of the French Open this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In another match featuring a seeded player, Thomas Enqvist of Sweden defeated 
11th-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Lendl, the one-time No. 1 who flashed some of his old form Monday, 
complained of a sore back and withdrew in the second set of Wednesday's match 
with David Wheaton. Wheaton had won the first set, 7-6 (7-5), and was leading 
2-0 in the second when Lendl, 34, left the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Stoltenberg, unseeded but playing well lately, ousted fifth-seeded 
Andrei Medvedev, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2. Stoltenberg, 24, of Australia, is the hottest 
player on the ATP tour, winning 16 of 19 matches in the past four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos Mansdorf of Israel upset 10th-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 
6-3, 6-3.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; VALDES MIGHT BE SENT TO ALBUQUERQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers might send pitcher Ismael Valdes to the minors on Friday morning 
in order to keep him pitching during the impending strike. Fred Claire, 
executive vice president, said he will not add a player and plans to cut the 
roster to 24, though he would not confirm that Valdes is the player. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdes, 20, has taken over the setup role for the Dodgers, pitching well since 
he was promoted on June 8. Since then, in 21 appearances he has compiled a 3-1 
record with a 3.18 earned-run average and 28 strikeouts in 28 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdes has risen through the Dodger system quickly -- after starting the 
season in double-A San Antonio, he was promoted to Triple-A Albuquerque on May 
20, where he was 3-0 in four starts with a 2.77 ERA.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would prefer to stay with my team, but if they send me to pitch in 
triple-A, well, it's an order," Valdes said.  
</P>
<P>
 But the moves come with a risk. If a player is sent down he has to stay for 10 
days, barring an injury. If the strike doesn't happen, or ends before 10 days, 
the player still has to stay the allotted time. Also, players have to be on the 
roster by Aug. 31 for postseason play, if there is one. 
</P>
<P>
 A move Claire said he wouldn't make is sending Rafael Bournigal, who is making 
$134,000, to Albuquerque for Jose Offerman, who is making $550,000. 
</P>
<P>

 Tests revealed that Tom Candiotti has a strained upper left back. Candiotti, 
who felt stiffness when he pitched Tuesday, flew home Wednesday to Los Angeles 
to be examined by team orthopedist Ralph Gambardella at Centinela Medical 
Center. "The only thing we can trace it to is the line drive he took on the 
left side of his chest in that game in San Francisco," team therapist Pat 
Screnar said. "He had a cramping sensation and said that during the game he 
couldn't reach back and (throw) what he wanted." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 According to Financial World magazine, the Dodgers spent 52.2% of their 1993 
revenues on players' salaries. The Cincinnati Reds led the 28 major league 
teams, paying 86.8% of revenues to its players. The Dodgers were 21st. The 
lowest was the San Diego Padres, who spent only 25.6%. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Reds' reliever Rob Dibble, who had rotator cuff surgery on his right shoulder 
in April, completed his rehabilitation assignment at the club's triple-A team 
in Indianapolis, but it didn't go all that well. In six games, Dibble had an 
0-2 record with 10 walks over 4 1/3 innings and a 22.85 ERA. Cincinnati 
activated him from the disabled list Wednesday and optioned starter Kevin 
Jarvis to Indianapolis. The roster move was a technicality. Dibble, the Reds' 
union representative, would go on strike Friday whether he was in the minors or 
on the 25-man roster. MARYANN HUDSON

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; WHITE SOX SWEAT IT OUT BUT RETAIN LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Chicago White Sox have to go out, they want to go out on top. Keeping 
sole possession of the American League Central lead in their final game before 
Friday's anticipated strike wasn't easy, though. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox defeated the Oakland Athletics, 2-1, on Wednesday at Oakland, 
hanging onto the lead for the last five innings knowing that the second-place 
Cleveland Indians had defeated the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew Cleveland won, and we knew we had to win," starter Jason Bere (12-2) 
said. "We knew Oakland was going to play us tough because they're in a race 
with Texas. We knew what was at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox lead the Indians by one game. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Franco scored the go-ahead run on a wild pitch in the fourth and drove 
in another run later. 
</P>
<P>
 With the loss, the Athletics, who can still catch the Texas Rangers with a 
victory today against the Seattle Mariners, missed a chance to gain ground on 
the Rangers, who lost to the Mariners. Oakland starter Steve Ontiveros (6-4) 
pitched a five-hitter but didn't get any offensive help. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's pitchers spent the game eluding trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Bere, who hasn't lost since June 18, pitched with runners on base in every 
inning but the first. He went 5 2/3 innings, giving up six hits, striking out 
three and walking two before giving way to Jose DeLeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 5, Toronto 3 -- Jason Grimsley pitched six strong innings at Toronto 
to win for the fourth time in five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimsley (5-2) gave up seven hits and two runs over six innings. Eric Plunk 
pitched three innings for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Guzman (12-11) fell to 0-3 against the Indians this season after going 
6-0 against them in his first three seasons. 
</P>

 Jim Thome went three for four and Kenny Lofton got stolen base No. 60 for the 
Indians. 
</P>

Rich Rowland and one by Mo Vaughn. 
</P>

<P>
 Orioles 8, Yankees 1 -- Rafael Palmeiro drove in five runs with four hits to 
back the pitching of Ben McDonald as the Orioles roughed up Jimmy Key at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmeiro had two singles, a two-run double and a three-run homer while 
McDonald (14-7) held the Yankees to five hits. He struck out two and didn't 
walk a batter in 7 1/3 innings before leaving because of a mild cramp in his 
right forearm. 
</P>

runs, one walk and struck out five in seven innings.

Tex., to help the Mariners deny the Rangers a chance to clinch first place in 
the AL West before the impending strike.

<P>
 Blowers homered against Tom Henke (3-6). The Rangers have lost six in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Risley (9-6) pitched 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief, and Bobby Ayala 
pitched the 10th for his 18th save. 
</P>
<P>

at the Kingdome, has won a season-high five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 4, Milwaukee 0 -- David Wells pitched a three-hitter for his first 
shutout and Cecil Fielder had two RBIs at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells, relying mostly on fastballs, retired 15 consecutive batters before Greg 
Vaughn hit a two-out single in the ninth inning.

DEL MAR; CHANGES GIVE UNFAMILIAR LOOK TO FIELD FOR THE PACIFIC CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crosscurrents will be everywhere when Del Mar stages the $1-million Pacific 
Classic Saturday. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bobby Frankel trained Bertrando when he won the Classic last year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bertrando is one of Saturday's favorites, but his trainer is now John 
Shirreffs, and Frankel's horse in the 1994 Classic is Tinners Way, a longshot 
who has won only one of nine starts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Best Pal won the first running of the Classic in 1991 and finished 
third in 1993, Gary Jones was his trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Richard Mandella will saddle Best Pal Saturday, while Jones tries to win 
the race with Stuka, who has won only two races in two years, one of them this 
year's Santa Anita Handicap after The Wicked North was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pat Valenzuela, who rode Best Pal to his victory in the Classic, is now 
riding Bertrando. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gary Stevens, who rode Bertrando when he won the Classic, will be astride 
Slew Of Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kent Desormeaux, who wanted to ride Best Pal again after he got off him 
last year, won't even be in town. Chris McCarron replaced Desormeaux, who will 
be at Saratoga to ride the Jones-trained Lakeway, odds-on favorite in the 
Alabama Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The only loose end in this situation might be Ian Jory, who trained Best Pal 
before anybody else did. If Jory had a horse in the Pacific Classic, the 
pattern would be complete. As it is, all Jory can do is watch to see how soon 
his prediction of four years ago will come true. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that's surprised me about Best Pal's career is that he's not 
No. 1 on the earnings list yet," Jory said. "I always thought he would be. I 
said he would be when he was a 2-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 If Best Pal takes the winner's share of $550,000 Saturday, his earnings would 
jump to $5.3 million and leave him behind only Alysheba ($6.6 million) and John 
Henry ($6.5 million). The four retired horses ahead of Best Pal on the list are 
those two plus Sunday Silence and Easy Goer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite physical ailments -- hoof trouble, a splint injury and a bleeding 
problem -- Best Pal was a $1-million-a-year horse during his first three years 
in training, and he earned more than $900,000 last year, even though he won 
only two races. 
</P>
<P>
 "He still looks great," Jory said. "He's a lot bigger and stronger than when I 
had him. He's a horse that adapts to any kind of training. I trained him 
differently than Gary (Jones) did. I didn't push him, or work him hard. The key 
is to keep him happy, then just point him in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Jory was 32 and a transplanted Englishman who had been running a 
modest stable for six years in California when John and Betty Mabee of Golden 
Eagle Farm sent him Best Pal, a nondescript California-bred that would have 
brought little at public auction. Best Pal had been gelded, and his prospects 
had no one turning cartwheels. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, Jory thought he had another John Henry in his barn. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal was a gritty, inexperienced horse whose body might have been 50% 
heart. He broke his maiden in his first race, at Hollywood Park, and after a 
second place in a minor stake at Golden Gate Fields, he put together three 
stakes victories at Del Mar that summer, including the Del Mar Futurity. The 
next month, he won the Norfolk at Santa Anita, the first time he ran farther 
than a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal wasn't just winning races, he was annihilating the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mabees thought so little of him as a young horse that he wasn't nominated, 
for $500, to the Breeders' Cup, and after being supplemented for $120,000, Best 
Pal ran a disappointing sixth in the Juvenile at Belmont Park. But then he 
rebounded to win the $1-million Hollywood Futurity. He finished the year with 
six victories in eight starts and purses totaling $1 million. The year before, 
Jory's entire barn had earned $374,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 3-year-old, Best Pal had two preps for the Kentucky Derby. Jory was cocky 
about the horse by then, but Best Pal was beaten both times, finishing a 
half-length behind Dinard in the Santa Anita Derby. In the Kentucky Derby, 
after drawing the 15th post, in the dreaded auxiliary starting gate, Best Pal 
ran a big race, placing second to Strike The Gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he ran one of his worst races, finishing fifth, beaten by 11 lengths, in 
the Preakness. Jory had been hearing unsettling rumors about his status since 
Santa Anita, and in June, after Best Pal's second-place finish at 9-10 odds in 
the Silver Screen Handicap at Hollywood Park, the Mabees made the switch to 
Gary Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the veteran trainer's care, Best Pal won eight races and earned more 
than $3 million, but Jones stopped training for the Mabees last winter, 
clearing the way for Richard Mandella. 
</P>
<P>
 Jory, Jones and Mandella have all been exposed to Best Pal's burgeoning fan 
base. After an early victory at Santa Anita, one racegoer held aloft a 
California license plate just outside the winner's circle that read: "Bes Pal." 
After the horse's recent victory at Hollywood Park, Mandella said: "This is a 
horse that gets letters. In the mornings, people stop and say 'Hi' to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Jory has forged on, looking for another horse that will elevate his stable to 
a national level. He knows, of course, that he's not likely to find one as good 
or as popular. "Best Pal is one of those few horses that has a fan club," Jory 
said. "I don't believe there's another horse that's had the adulation he's 
had." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal, who runs better when he's outside horses, worked a half-mile 
Wednesday in 48 2/5 seconds and then drew a favorable No. 7 post as nine horses 
were entered for Saturday's Pacific Classic. He and entrymate Dramatic Gold are 
the 2-1 favorites on the morning line, with Bertrando at 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the horses will carry 124 pounds except the 3-year-olds, Silver Music 
and Dramatic Gold, who get 117 under the race's weight-for-age conditions. . . 
. Silver Music is being supplemented for $30,000. . . . The first post will be 
1 p.m. Saturday, with the Classic the fourth race on the card. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux was not suspended by the stewards after his winning mount, 
Wende, was disqualified to ninth place Monday. . . . Serena's Song, who 
finished second behind Mr Purple in the Hollywood Juvenile, returns to the 
2-year-old filly division Friday and faces seven rivals in the $75,000 Sorrento 
Stakes. Others running are How So Oiseau, Turko's Turn, Marfa Smeralda, 
Embroidered, Don't Bet Chalk, Great Threads and Ski Dancer. . . . After a 
couple of fourth places, the French import Sir Mark Sykes won his first race in 
the United States, coming from behind Wednesday to beat Navire by 
three-quarters of a length in the Escondido Handicap. Pacific Classic

TENNIS / DANA HADDAD; INJURY-FREE TU PRIMED TO HURT USTA 18S FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Meilen Tu is not limping. That's painful news for opponents who must deal with 
the unfettered Northridge resident at the U.S. Tennis Assn. girls' 18 national 
championships in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 She was seeded fifth in the event last year, but was troubled by a strain in 
her lower back and a sprain in her right ankle. She made her way to the 
quarterfinals, where she lost to top-seeded and eventual champion Janet Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse was 1992, the year Tu was seeded No. 2 in the 18s. Then a promising 
14-year-old, she defaulted in the third round because of a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 16, Tu has made her third trip to the 18 nationals, this time as the 
favorite. Injury-free, she works out in a gym regularly. She's never felt 
stronger, she says. And her scores from San Jose this week seem to indicate so. 
</P>
<P>
 First round: defeated Meredith Laughlin, 6-0, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Second round: defeated Kelly Baskin, 6-0, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Third round: defeated Justyna Gudzowska, 6-0, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth round: defeated Adrien Alder, 6-0, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Will her third try at the nationals be the charm? Perhaps. But Tu said she 
won't be disappointed if she doesn't win the championship Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I lose tomorrow or the day after . . . I did the best I could," she said. 
"The most important thing is that I'm improving. You don't hear many players 
saying that. I'm just happy if I play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Tu was playing well early this summer on the International Tennis Federation 
world junior tour. She won a grass-court tournament in England and was ranked 
15th by the ITF. But she believed she could be stronger. After returning in 
late July, she began to work on her speed, conditioning and upper body strength 
with trainer Damion Dormeyer at the Warner Center Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pushes me," Tu said. "If I didn't have someone like that, I wouldn't go in 
there. I can tell the difference now, especially in the third set. I can finish 
off a match." 
</P>
<P>
 Tu started playing for the U.S. national team last year. Since then she has 
inched her way up the ladder with a big victory here and there, but no 
championships. Since winning the Surbiton Junior Championships in London in 
June, she is on the verge of elite status. 
</P>
<P>
 She dominated Ludmila Varmuzova of the Czech Republic, 6-2, 6-1, in the final. 
Two weeks earlier, Varmuzova beat French Open finalist Mary Pierce in straight 
sets in a 21-and-under tournament in Eastbourne, England. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory in England only adds to the expectations the USTA has placed on Tu 
this week by seeding her No. 1. But with a new perspective, she doesn't let the 
hype bother her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being the No. 1 seed, a lot of girls say, 'Oh, the pressure's on you,' " she 
said. "I probably would have felt it a year ago or two years ago. But I think 
of tennis so much more different ever since my injuries. I don't worry so much 
about winning and losing anymore. I'm just enjoying playing." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Players' best friend: For 15 years, Martha Katsufrakis of Tarzana has directed 
the tournament desk at the Los Angeles Open. There she has escorted the likes 
of Arthur Ashe, Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe onto the court, recorded their 
scores and told them when to show up for the next round. 
</P>
<P>
 The players love Katsufrakis for little favors. She makes sure they get enough 
food, rest and privacy. Her charges make phone calls for the players and wash 
their laundry. Perhaps most important, she provides their entourages with 
tickets and passes to the players' lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, the boys bug me for tickets," she said. "When they're good, I 
help them get more tickets than they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 years, Katsufrakis can properly judge an impostor. Last week it was a 
man at the gate claiming to be Boris Becker's brother. This upset one of 
Becker's managers, who asked Katsufrakis why she didn't have a ticket for the 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Well, unless Mr. Becker leaves the ticket, we can't honor that,' " 
said Katsufrakis, who checked with a coach and within minutes confirmed that 
Becker has no male siblings.

 Deral Boykin, the Rams' starting strong safety, received six stitches and a 
tetanus shot after being hit in the head by teammate Darryl Ashmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmore, Boykin and several other players were involved in a scuffle during 
practice Wednesday.Boykin's helmet came off in the fracas, and Ashmore got a 
hold of it and slammed it into Boykin's head.

 Darryl Henley, who sat out the final 11 games last season, continues to work 
himself into shape while adjusting to the changes on defense in his absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am behind," Henley said. "It's not like riding a bike. Every night I go to 
bed having to study and I'm up in the morning refreshing myself on the notes 
I've made. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get better by practicing and I've missed a lot of practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, who was the team's starting cornerback last season, worked out twice a 
day in the final weeks leading up to his return to training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing prepares you for the first time you go out there with 22 guys," 
Henley said. "The way I'm looking at this situation is, I've signed with a new 
team and I have to work on the little things to get me back to where I was last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve Israel is playing some good football and he looks like a starter. We 
have some great corners here and Chuck Knox is making me work for everything. 
He told me when I signed that nothing was going to be given to me, and that's 
the way I want it." T.J. SIMERS

 Dave Brown has won the battle to become the New York Giants' No. 1 
quarterback. Now he faces perhaps an even bigger challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Battling the ghost of Phil Simms," Brown said. "It's always going to be 
there, whether I like it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dan Reeves announced that Brown had won the regular-season starting job 
over fellow third-year player Kent Graham. Brown will replace Simms, the 1986

 The New England Patriots added depth to their injury-depleted backfield 
Wednesday by obtaining Leroy Thompson, who had more than 1,000 total yards last 
season, from the Steelers. The Patriots obtained Thompson, 26, for an 
undisclosed draft pick. To free up money under the NFL's new salary cap, the 
Patriots relinquished their rights to unsigned running back Leonard Russell, a 
1,000-yard rusher last season.

 The Cleveland Browns, facing the loss of injured guard Mike Schad for eight 
weeks or more, signed former Houston Oiler guard Doug Dawson. Schad will 
undergo surgery Friday to repair a left biceps tendon, ruptured during a

BILL TO PADDLE GRAFFITI VANDALS DIES IN TIE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite intense election-year pressure to appear tough on crime, a deeply 
divided Assembly committee rejected a bill Wednesday that would have allowed 
juvenile court judges to punish youthful graffiti vandals with as many as 10 
whacks from a wooden paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Ways and Means Committee voted 11-11 on the measure, authored by 
Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), failing by the slimmest of margins to 
muster the dozen votes needed for the bill to escape the 23-member committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy expressed confidence late in the afternoon that the bill -- inspired by 
the highly publicized caning of American teen-ager Michael Fay for 
spray-painting cars in Singapore -- would win the necessary support. 
</P>
<P>
 But it died after Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and other Democratic leaders 
pulled aside Assemblyman Willard Murray (D-Paramount), a co-author of Conroy's 
bill, and persuaded him to switch his vote just before the committee adjourned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got Speakerized," Conroy said, using the term coined to reflect Brown's 
ability to sway votes of errant Democrats. "This is a textbook example of how 
the Democrats are able to bottle up good legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray said he still supports Conroy's measure, but decided to switch after 
Brown and other top Democrats told him it was a "wedge bill" designed to be 
used in the upcoming elections to embarrass Democrats who vote against the 
paddling proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it became a partisan issue, so being a good team player, I went along 
with what they wanted," Murray said. "There were a number of Democratic 
members, six or eight, who asked me to change my vote. . . . I won't lose a 
great deal of sleep over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's proposal received nationwide publicity in the weeks after he 
suggested that judges be allowed to order parents or court bailiffs to 
administer four to 10 strokes with a three-quarter-inch-thick wooden paddle to 
convicted graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy began pursuing the idea after being prodded by constituents and staff 
members caught up in the highly publicized debate over the Singapore case. Fay, 
an 18-year-old high school senior from Dayton, Ohio, received four strokes from 
a rattan cane May 5 after being found guilty of vandalism in the island nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's bill also would have required publicizing the names of juvenile 
offenders who were paddled, a tactic designed to heighten the humiliation and 
deter other would-be taggers. The measure also contained a sunset clause that 
would have required the Legislature to renew its approval after paddling was 
given a three-year trial run. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the paddling bill "met its appropriate fate" and that, with 
politicians whipped up by election-year fervor over crime, it represented a 
"terrible way to make public policy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mr. Murray observed the Republicans trying to politically embarrass 
some of our members," Brown said. "He wasn't about to let that happen. When he 
realized there were games being played, he canceled the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy asked that the bill be reconsidered by the committee next week, but the 
delay jeopardizes any chance to win final approval in both houses by the end of 
the legislative year Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which would have reinstituted court-ordered corporal punishment 
in the United States for the first time in more than four decades, was pummeled 
by opponents during Wednesday's hearing. It drew sharp criticism from a wide 
range of foes, including children's rights advocates, educators and civil 
libertarians. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics worried that Conroy's proposal and similar ideas circulating in 
Florida, Maryland and Texas threatened to tug the country back toward a style 
of courtroom punishment abandoned decades ago. Several expressed concern about 
the potential for sadistic abuse when society gives people power to inflict 
pain on others. Others cited studies suggesting that paddling could inflict 
injuries ranging from blood blisters to loss of bladder control. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also pointed to research showing that corporal punishment can lead to 
embitterment, anger and post-traumatic stress while teaching impressionable 
youths the contradictory lesson that violence is the way to solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The most heated attacks Wednesday came from Democrats on the Ways and Means 
Committee, who suggested that Conroy's bill was a misdirected, hypocritical 
attempt to solve a complex social problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this bill goes through we'd be opening the door to court-sanctioned, 
government-sanctioned violence," said Assemblywoman Barbara Lee (D-Oakland). 
"We're trying to teach our young people nonviolent approaches to violence. 
Violence begets violence. You've got to understand that paddling or beating a 
young person, no matter how minimal, sends a message that violence is really 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee chairman, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), cited 
studies showing that most violent felons suffered at the hands of abusive 
adults during their youth. "It's pretty clear that most people in our prisons 
who are violent were physically, violently attacked while they were children," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen Waters, a California Teachers Assn. lobbyist, told the committee that 
"this makes my own list of the 10 goofiest bills of the session." 
</P>
<P>
 The constitutionality of Conroy's bill remains open to debate. The California 
Legislative Counsel, which provides legal opinions to state lawmakers, 
determined that Conroy's bill is unconstitutional. But an analysis by the staff 
counsel for the Assembly's Public Safety Committee, which in June approved the 
measure by a 4-1 vote, said the issue remains "an open question" because there 
is "no bright line" setting the limit for what is cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, however, resolutely defended his bill as the surest way to persuade 
teen-age taggers to stop their destructive practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have created a whole group of individuals who feel they are above the law 
and can act in any criminal fashion with total impunity," Conroy said, adding 
that paddling would "send a very clear message to those who destroy property. 
And the message is that there is a consequence for your actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy told the committee that California has "lost one or two generations of 
children because of our misguided juvenile justice policies," suggesting that 
his paddling bill would help "save some of these children from a life of petty 
crime so that we can start to close prisons in the future, not just keep 
opening them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County assemblyman brought several experts on graffiti and gangs 
before the committee in an effort to provide testimony on the merits of 
paddling youthful offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about self-esteem and what this could do to a child's psyche," 
said Glenn Dowell of the Youth Empowerment Project, an anti-crime program in 
Atlanta. "But the kids who I have talked to in one detention facility after 
another have said to me they would not be where they are if someone had 
disciplined them." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles D. Willis, a psychologist who worked in California prisons for a 
decade, said that "early corrective discipline will keep some of these young 
people out of prison," adding that "ordinary discipline will not damage 
anyone's psyche."

LIFE WILL GO ON, BUT MAYBE NOT AT BIG A; BASEBALL: FANS, PLAYERS AND STADIUM 
WORKERS ARE ALL MAKING STRIKE PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fishing reels were oiled, hunting rifles cleaned, jet skis tuned and airline 
tickets for home nestled in the pockets of shirts hung next to neat, white 
uniforms in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Major league baseball players are set to go on strike Friday, so Wednesday 
night's meeting between the Angels and the Kansas City Royals might end up 
being the last big league baseball game of the summer at Anaheim Stadium. If 
it's spitting, scratching and cussing you crave, you'll probably have to settle 
for "NYPD Blue" for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 There were few outward signs that this game -- won by the Angels, 2-1 -- was 
different from any other. The announced crowd of 19,605 was typical for 
midweek. A few disgruntled fans displayed signs -- "Mom, Send Money to the 
Pension Fund . . . DON'T STRIKE!" read one -- but most in attendance were 
anything but morose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bummer," said Lanette Larson of Brea, her Angel cap worn backward, 
either as a fashion statement or a form of protest. "But we'll get by. There 
are lots of other things to do. Dude, this is Southern California, and it's 
summertime." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are still baseball purists, those who hang onto nostalgic notions of 
the game, who are revived by the smell of hot dogs, peanuts, even stale beer, 
who have only hostile feelings for the millionaires' club deciding the future 
of their beloved national pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have only one word to say about both sides of this strike," a professorial 
looking man interjected into a discussion in front of the stadium. "Selfish . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there were two words. One unprintable. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 season, born so full of potential and promise, might indeed be going 
up in the smoke of an unlucky strike. Clearly, it would be an unfortunate work 
stoppage for a number of big swingers such as San Francisco's Matt Williams, 
who is in hot pursuit of New York Yankee Roger Maris' most-coveted record for 
home runs in a season, 61 in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is on a pace to hit 61, and the only strike he wants to see is belt 
high and over the middle of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 While it might go down in baseball lore as the Season That Might Have Been, 
1994 has already lost much of its luster for the Angels. Owners of the worst 
record in the American League, they have lost 14 of their last 19 games. In the 
past week alone, they have lost three times in extra innings. Futility seems to 
stalk them at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe it's no surprise that talk in the Angel clubhouse has turned to which 
personal watercraft have the most power and which lures are sure to attract the 
biggest largemouth bass. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is consumed only by visions of unexpected vacations, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think about the fans, I feel the kind of heartache you feel when your 
first girlfriend dumps you," said utility player Rex Hudler, who played 
professional baseball in Japan last year, signed with the Angels during spring 
training and has been a source of bubbling optimism ever since. "They're the 
innocent victims in this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly don't feel sorry for me. I feel sorry for the vendor who's 
working a second job to earn the money for his little summer vacation. But it's 
something I can't control. Now, if I could get the owners to name me the 
commissioner of baseball, I'd have this thing settled in a heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 A players union strike in 1981 lasted 50 days, although it ended in time for 
the season to resume in August. In 1985, a strike lasted just one day. Most 
feel this one won't be settled quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Union head Donald Fehr said after Wednesday's negotiating session broke up 
early that "there's no sense in having a meeting just to have a meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's nothing substantive," he said, "we all have better things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment was clearly the most popular theme Wednesday night around the 
Big A. While some worried about the financial hardships that loomed, many were 
busy making plans for the time off. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Tarter, a 21-year-old clubhouse attendant from Anaheim who attends 
Fullerton College in the off-season, isn't fretting about the loss of his sole 
source of income. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a little money saved, and as long as I don't get in any car wrecks 
and my insurance premiums don't go up, I'll be all right," he said, smiling. 
"If it lasts too much longer than that, I'll get another job. No big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think it might last awhile. There's a weird feeling around here. It's 
like the last day of school. I keep waiting for the cupcakes and the class 
party to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Engel, lobby director at Anaheim Stadium, says she is actually looking 
forward to a short strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a whole list of things to do," she said. "Two or three weeks would 
be perfect. I also have a full-time job, so the only thing it really affects 
with me is how many concerts I go to. And I need a break. I need the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be little rest for those so weary of losing, however. Said Tim 
Mead, Angel assistant general manager: "Don't laugh, but we need to look at 
what didn't go right and why. There's a reason for everything that's happened 
on the field this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Marcel Lachemann will also be using his time in the strike zone to 
search for clues. Answers might be too much to ask for. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first couple of days, I'm going to try and get more organized," said 
Lachemann, who took over after Buck Rodgers was fired in May. "I want to break 
down the roster, see where everyone is and what we can do to help them improve. 
Then I'll have the coaches do the same sort of evaluation on each player in 
their area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to say we need this and we need that, but it isn't that easy to get 
those players. So you'd better figure out the best you can do with what you 
have. There are a lot of things that can be done, but as much as the time can 
be used effectively, I think playing games would be much more valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Hudler, who loves to play so much he's starting to envy those he left 
behind in Japan. "I've got to call my buddy (former Angel) Jack Howell and tip 
my hat to him. He decided to stay another year over there because of the 
possibility of the strike. Looks like a good call now." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who is convinced that a strike is the only way to 
get the owners to negotiate in good faith, acknowledged that he was suffering 
from a bout of melancholy before taking the field for what could be the final 
time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you know the issues, when you know what's really going on, it makes it 
easier to make peace with yourself," he said. "But it is too early for the 
season to end. This isn't October, it's August, when kids like to come to the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 "This strike will cost me money. It will cost the fans games. It's going to 
make a lot of people angry, and (the players) aren't going to get a lot of 
sympathy. But it's something we have to stand up for, even if a lot of people 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Not taking into consideration the money they'd save from unpaid player 
salaries, club officials figure the Angels will lose about $160,000 for each of 
the 21 home games that could be wiped out, beginning Aug. 23 when the Angels 
are scheduled to play host to Milwaukee. The city of Anaheim will lose an 
estimated $61,000 in stadium revenue per game. Workers in the concession stands 
said they will lose about $1,500 if the strike wipes out the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Hayes, who has worked in a souvenir stand near Gate 3 for 15 years, 
says she will be out between $67 and $100 in salary and commission every game, 
although "$100 is a high, and we haven't had too many highs around here 
lately." 
</P>
<P>
 "I use the money to buy books," she said. "I'm studying respiratory therapy at 
Orange Coast College. Pretty soon I'll be working at a hospital and won't have 
to put up with this stuff. But, you know, I'll probably keep working here 
because there's no stress, and I like meeting the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked Hayes the price of a custom-size Angel cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only the players can afford this kind, they're $25," she said. "Well, they're 
$25 now. Who knows what they'll be after the strike. The fans always pay in the 
end."

DEPARTURE OF 2 MAY RESHAPE LAGUNA POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two political allies who helped define Laguna Beach as an island of liberalism 
in conservative Orange County since the 1980s have announced they will not seek 
reelection to the City Council in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert F. Gentry, the first openly gay elected official in Orange County, and 
Lida Lenney, an outspoken environmental activist who served as mayor during the 
devastating fire in October, said they are bowing out for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Their widely anticipated decisions come at a crucial time for the city, where 
the liberals who have held power for most of the last 20 years may face a 
forceful challenge from more conservative candidates with a different political 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry, a three-term councilman who lost two houses in the fire, said 
Wednesday that he will turn his attention to rebuilding his home and rental 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have absolutely no regrets, no bad feelings, don't harbor any personal 
animosity," he said. "Part of me says, save me a seat, I may come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenney released a five-page handwritten letter Tuesday night listing the 
city's accomplishments during her eight years on the council and noting, "My 
life has progressed from periods of reaching out to the world to periods of 
withdrawing, re-energizing and moving on to the next challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 She couldn't be reached for further comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council terms expire this year and many residents are clamoring for 
change. Mayor Ann Christoph, who along with Gentry and Lenney make up the 
council majority, is the only incumbent entering the race. 
</P>
<P>
 With what some sense as a conservative backlash sweeping the city, Gentry said 
the coming election "could change the very fabric of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the announcements from Lenney and Gentry, the community had been 
buzzing with talk about how Election Day, 1994, might alter the city that for 
years has fought development, struggled to preserve open space and pressed for 
gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers predict the city's priorities will soon be reordered and the 
emphasis shifted from social causes and environmental preservation to public 
safety, fiscal prudence and property rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe it's time for a moderate council to be elected who governs with 
common sense and balances growth and environmental needs with fiscal 
responsibility," said Michele L. Oliver, director of United Laguna, a vocal 
activist group that has often opposed the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Political tensions were heightened by the October firestorm, which destroyed 
or damaged more than 400 homes and took a heavy emotional toll. Since then, the 
attention of many residents, and most political groups, has been fastened on 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the city's two most high-profile liberals step aside, more conservative 
groups are gaining strength. For example, membership in the Laguna Beach 
Taxpayers Assn. has grown from fewer than 300 to almost 1,300 in the past two 
years, said Robert R. Mosier, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're really looking at what we want this city to be in the year 
2000," chamber of commerce President Joe Orsak said. "We weren't able to turn 
out the votes in the past. . . . It'll be a lot easier this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Such talk makes some residents nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Laguna is really at a crossroads," said longtime resident Ray 
Unger. "If we get more of a conservative council in again, we will have 
high-rises and all kinds of things we have been fighting all these years to 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Bivens Hunt said she formed the new political action committee, Protect Laguna 
94, "to keep big development out of Laguna Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think there are other groups in town that are in favor of development, 
although they keep saying they're not," Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, groups and individuals who oppose the current council majority say 
they too are concerned about the environment and favor the council's stand on 
gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want a revolution, we just want a slight change of priorities," said 
Steve Esslinger, whose family owns a mobile home park in Laguna Beach. "It's 
absurd to think you could build skyscrapers by controlling city hall. And 
anyone who votes thinking that is true is going to vote in an extreme way." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday afternoon, a dozen residents had taken out papers to run for 
council. Two of them -- real estate broker and former city councilman Wayne 
Baglin and attorney Steve Dicterow -- have filed their nomination papers with 
the city clerk's office. The deadline for filing is Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say privately it has been difficult to find candidates who 
philosophically resemble the current council majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very nasty environment in Laguna Beach right now," said one political 
activist who asked not to be named. "We have just had one hell of a time 
finding somebody who wants to run for City Council, and that's sad." 
</P>
<P>
 At least two potential candidates declined to run, fearing what one called a 
"bloody, real bloody," campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, some say, the battle lines are drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in town knows who's on which side of the fence," said Elizabeth 
Pearson , chairwoman of The Laguna Coalition, an umbrella political group 
representing 40 civic groups in Laguna Beach. The coalition has already 
endorsed Baglin and Dicterow, both members of the Laguna Beach Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 City firefighters, who have also opened a political headquarters in town, have 
endorsed the same two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 With her closest allies on the council bailing out, Christoph summed up her 
concerns about the future, saying simply, "I hope I will have some support."

HARASSMENT FIGHT VOWED BY FBI CHIEF; DISCIPLINE: IN AN OUTGROWTH OF COMPLAINTS 
BY TWO SANTA ANA FEMALE AGENTS, FREEH SAYS SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, BIAS WON'T BE 
TOLERATED. OFFENDING SUPERVISORS FACE FIRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, vowing that sexual harassment and discrimination 
"will not be tolerated" inside the FBI, warned Wednesday that any supervisor 
found to have harassed a subordinate will probably be fired in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh's statement came as an outgrowth of a Santa Ana case in which two female 
FBI agents charged that their male supervisor taunted and fondled them and made 
lewd remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor, John Carpenter, a 20-year bureau veteran, was suspended 
without pay for 45 days, reduced in rank and transferred to the Long Beach 
office, according to law enforcement sources. Carpenter, who denied the 
allegations, could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing privacy concerns, Freeh and other FBI officials declined to specify 
Carpenter's punishment but contended that it was in line with the most severe 
discipline in other comparable cases. The FBI director said the guidelines for 
future punishment will be harsher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recognize that the severity of punishments I am announcing is a departure 
from past practice," Freeh said. "It is, however, fully consistent with my 
often stated views about the high standards of professional conduct I expect 
from each FBI employee, whether agent or support, to abide by." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana case, which led to federal lawsuits in March by the two agents, 
Heather Power-Anderson and Boni Carr-Alduenda, was settled with unusual speed 
by the FBI in May. The FBI agreed to pay $192,500 to Power-Anderson and 
$155,000 to Carr-Alduenda in exchange for their dropping the suit, according to 
their lawyer, Christopher B. Mears of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement agreement also provided that Freeh would issue a public 
statement acknowledging the agreement and "reiterating the FBI's commitment to 
the maintenance of a workplace free from all forms of discrimination and 
retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
 His statement Wednesday appeared to go further with its declaration that FBI 
employees who engage in sexual harassment and discrimination "can expect the 
maximum penalties" and that supervisors who harass subordinates in the future 
will probably be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, attorney Mears said Freeh's statement amounts to "full 
vindication" for his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "The action of these two agents has resulted in an important escalation in the 
bureau's stance against sexual harassment and sexual discrimination," Mears 
said. "If the women of the bureau had any chance of escaping this environment 
of discrimination, Freeh needed to take a harsh stance and he did." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mears said the full measure of Freeh's new policy directives will not 
be clear until it is known how the bureau intends to deal with Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mears said Carpenter should be fired for his "reprehensible conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson of Mission Viejo has been a special agent since 1984, and 
Carr-Alduenda of Laguna Niguel has been with the bureau since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson, who was assigned to Carpenter's squad, said that in one 
incident he kissed her on the back of the neck while she was sitting at her 
desk. Another time, she alleged, Carpenter tore her dress when he forced his 
hand onto her upper thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr-Alduenda alleged that Carpenter constantly grabbed her and commented 
several times about the size of her breasts. In the lawsuit, she said that when 
she returned from maternity leave in September, 1992, Carpenter remarked: 
"Maternity has been good to you. Your breasts are really big. Are you breast 
feeding? I wish I was your baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Mears said that since the settlement of the lawsuit, his clients have settled 
into an "acceptable coexistence" with fellow agents, occasionally having to 
deal with "comments and attitudes" from friends of Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some male agents have a real problem with what happened and they let (the 
women) know about it. But they are behaving. If we find that they don't behave, 
we'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, FBI spokesman Gary K. Morley said the office would have no 
comment about Freeh's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you're gonna get on that deal is in the statement," said Morley, who also 
declined to comment on Carpenter's status. 
</P>
<P>
 Mears said Freeh's directive "should be the policy of all government 
agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes these big government agencies are slow to keep pace, and the bureau 
is one of those agencies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Freeh issued guidelines on employee conduct that defined standards 
and promised harsh discipline, including firing, for behavior "fundamentally 
inconsistent with continued FBI employment." Examples given in the guidelines, 
which Freeh described as a "bright line" for employees, included lying under 
oath, theft, falsification of documents and unauthorized disclosure of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines gave more authority to senior managers to handle allegations of 
misconduct. They also provided for speedier resolution of disciplinary matters 
to strengthen the credibility and fairness of the process, which the FBI 
acknowledged had been a longstanding concern of employees. BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County-based FBI Agents Boni Carr-Alduenda and Heather Power-Anderson 
filed a civil rights lawsuit in March alleging that they were fondled and 
taunted by Supervising Agent John Carpenter, head of the bureau's Orange County 
white-collar crime unit. In May, the FBI agreed to pay nearly $350,000 to 
settle the suit -- $192,500 to Power-Anderson and $155,000 to Carr-Alduenda -- 
in exchange for their dropping the case. As a condition of the settlement, FBI 
Director Louis J. Freeh stated the bureau's commitment to maintain a "workplace 
free from all forms of discrimination and retaliation." Wednesday, he warned 
that supervisors who engage in harassment will probably be fired. 
Power-Anderson and Carr-Alduenda remain with Orange County white-collar crime 
unit. Carpenter transferred to the Long Beach office. FBI officials declined to 
reveal his status.

COUPLE GET 6 YEARS EACH IN BABY'S RAT-BITE DEATH; COURTS: JUDGE SAYS THEY CARED 
MORE FOR DRUGS THAN THEIR CHILDREN. HE ASSAILS O.C. SOCIAL WORKERS FOR NOT 
INTERVENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A homeless couple whose 4-month-old son died after their pet rat bit the child 
more than 110 times was sentenced Wednesday to six years in prison after a 
judge denounced them as callously indifferent parents who cared more about 
getting high on drugs than caring for their son. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Kazaharu Makino also lashed out at county 
social workers who failed to intervene despite repeated complaints about the 
parents and their filthy living conditions -- including a plea for help from 
the baby's grandparents shortly before the infant's death last August. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathyleen Giguere, 31, wept quietly while her husband, Steven Giguere Sr., 28, 
buried his face in his hands as the judge sentenced them to the maximum prison 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Makino said the parents could have taken simple steps to improve life for 
4-month-old Steven and his 3-year-old sister, Karissa. Instead, he said, the 
couple used their public assistance money and earnings from begging on street 
corners to buy alcohol and their daily $20 fix of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two children were solely dependent on their mother and father for their 
welfare. These people were given public money for the welfare of their 
children," Makino said. "Instead, that money went for drugs. They used that 
money for their own self-interest so much that they couldn't pay rent, they 
couldn't buy food, they had to live in their car." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys said their clients were devastated by the baby's death and 
blamed the couple's drug addictions for the family's poor living conditions. 
Both defense lawyers asked that the parents be placed on probation and receive 
drug treatment. Defense attorney William Watson told the judge that Kathyleen 
Giguere is enrolled in an alcohol treatment program in jail. He said his client 
could receive no worse sentence than losing her son, whom the attorney 
described as the focus of Kathyleen Giguere's life. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge took exception with those comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steven Jr. was far from the primary focus of her life," Makino said. "The 
primary focus of her life was to get loaded, high on drugs and gratify her need 
for that." 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury in June convicted the couple each of two 
counts of felony child neglect -- one count for each child. Jurors also 
deadlocked 9-3 in favor of convicting the parents of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors were not allowed the hear testimony about the couple's drug use. The 
judge had found that introducing that evidence would be too prejudicial. 
</P>
<P>
 During trial, defense attorneys sought to portray the couple as victims of a 
tragic accident whose impoverished living standards were unfairly being held up 
to scrutiny. They also argued that the child was already dead -- possibly from 
sudden infant death syndrome -- when the rat attacked. But Makino said 
Wednesday he had little doubt the rat caused the infant's death. 
</P>
<P>
 The car was parked in an Anaheim parking lot when the Aug. 26, 1993, rat-bite 
attack took place, but Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Tanizaki said he does not believe 
the parents were in the vehicle when the attack occurred. An autopsy shows the 
baby had not been fed in 24 hours and had air in his lungs at the time of 
death, indicating he had been crying heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents have denied leaving the child alone. Kathyleen Giguere suggested 
to a probation officer that she may have slept through the attack, according to 
a pre-sentencing report on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's daughter, now 4, lives with her grandparents. The daughter is 
seeing a therapist and is making progress, according to the pre-sentencing 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gigueres have indicated that they want to reunite with their daughter. 
Kathyleen Giguere has received a birth control implant, but hopes to have 
another child as soon as possible to "replace" Steven Jr., according to a 
report prepared by the Orange County Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the couple's friends and family members criticized the Gigueres and their 
lifestyle. Kathyleen Giguere was depicted by her relatives as a vindictive, 
pathological liar who stole from those closest to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathyleen Giguere's sister, Carolyn Ryan, told a probation officer that her 
sibling should be "fixed" so she can never have another child, according to 
court records. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kathyleen Giguere, who had once worked as a topless dancer and a hostess, 
had an older daughter from a previous relationship taken from her by Los 
Angeles County child welfare workers, she refused to go through the steps to 
regain custody, but also would not sign documents to allow the child to be 
adopted, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Giguere, who had worked as a mechanic, also has a child from a previous 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Others told probation officials that Kathyleen Giguere used drugs while she 
was pregnant and later while breast-feeding her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, society takes the position that having children is a right 
rather than a privilege," Deputy Probation Officer Louise Pritchard wrote in 
the pre-sentencing report. 
</P>
<P>
 She later added: "This crime is a perfect example of where society must take a 
stand in favor of its children." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has taken its toll on the Gigueres' relationship. Watson said he 
fears the couple might divorce soon in part because of the strain of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the judge was incredulous that authorities with the Orange 
County Department of Social Services did not do more to protect the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Howard, the director of the county's Department of Children's Services, 
could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials had checked on the family numerous times dating back to 1990, 
had ordered them to clean up a trash-strewn apartment where food was allowed to 
spoil on counters and remained there for weeks, while floors were cluttered 
with empty beer cans and liquor bottles, and dog and cat feces, court records 
indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, officials found Karissa with bite marks on her face -- although 
the records do not indicate the origin of the bites, the records also said. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1993, the children's grandparents -- Steven Sr.'s father and 
stepmother -- lodged a complaint with the county about the Gigueres, but social 
workers were unable to locate the transient couple to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just makes you wonder what their standard is in the Department of Social 
Services and what is required to make them take steps to intervene," Makino 
said.

3 KILLED, 4 INJURED IN GAS LEAK; ACCIDENT: WORKERS ARE OVERCOME BY TOXIC 
HYDROGEN SULFIDE FUMES DURING ROUTINE DRILLING PROCEDURE AT AN OIL FACILITY 
NORTH OF VENTURA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three workers were killed and four others injured Wednesday after inhaling 
fumes from a hydrogen sulfide gas leak at an oil production plant north of 
Ventura, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12:07 p.m. gas leak occurred at Vintage Petroleum's oil production plant 
in the foothills of Rincon Mountain in Seacliff, just off the Ventura Freeway, 
as workers were in the process of redrilling an old oil well, fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers were in a pit injecting water down a steel pipe to try to force oil to 
the surface, a standard drilling procedure, at the time of the accident, said 
Joe Luna, a spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 When the men removed their nozzles, water started gushing out of the ground, 
releasing a small concentration of hydrogen sulfide fumes, Luna said. The men 
were immediately overcome by the gas, which sent three of them into cardiac 
arrest, while the other four experienced respiratory problems, Luna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Fire Chief Dave Festerling said the colorless gas, a byproduct of 
crude oil that smells like rotten eggs, can be absorbed so rapidly into the 
blood stream that it is sometimes fatal by the time a person smells it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the right concentration, you can be very dead in one breath," Festerling 
said, noting that the workers had apparently not been wearing gas masks. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters arriving at the scene used electronic sensors to measure the 
toxic fumes in the air, and found levels low enough to treat the injured 
workers at the scene, Luna said. Because the gas had quickly dissipated, there 
was no evacuation of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 One man was pronounced dead at the scene and two others died later at 
Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura. Officials at the hospital said doctors 
worked on the two men for an hour, but that they never regained a pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead and injured workers were employees of independent contracting firms 
hired by Tulsa, Okla.-based Vintage Petroleum to do the drilling, officials 
said. Pride Petroleum Services and Schlumberger Well Services, both of Ventura, 
are the two contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead were identified as Sean David Harris, 26, of Oxnard, Jason Hoskins, 
22, of Ventura and Ronald Johnson, 24, of Oxnard, who was pronounced dead at 
the scene. All worked for Pride Petroleum Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The other four critically injured workers were initially taken by helicopter 
to Ventura County Medical Center, but two were transferred to St. John's 
Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo and two to Los Robles Medical Center in 
Thousand Oaks. Both hospitals are equipped with hyperbaric chambers, 
pressurized cylinders that allow doctors to administer pure doses of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chambers are pressurized with 100% oxygen, which will detoxify all the 
inert gases in their tissue," said Dr. J. B. Wilmeth, director of the 
hyperbaric unit at Los Robles. "It displaces the gases instantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, it takes about 5 1/2 hours to reduce half of the gases in the 
victim's system, he said. But with the hyperbaric chamber, that time can be 
reduced to about 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 One victim at Los Robles, identified as Derek Abbott, 18, of Oak View, was 
listed in fair condition late Wednesday. The other victim at that hospital, 
identified as Jerry Walker, 41, of Bakersfield, was also in fair condition, a 
Los Robles spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott had worked for Pride Petroleum Services about six weeks, said his 
stepfather, George Farmer. He grew up in Oak View and recently graduated from 
Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer said his stepson had enjoyed his brief work in the oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved it," Farmer said. "He just wanted to have a steady job. He's got a 
new truck and all that." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer said his stepson was a little disoriented, but in a good mood when he 
arrived at the Ventura County Medical Center emergency room. After being 
transferred to Los Robles, his condition improved throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "His mother just called and said he's doing great," Farmer said late 
Wednesday. "He's one of the lucky ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at St. John's said late Wednesday that the condition of the two 
patients there was improving. Jeff Sandoval, 34, of Bakersfield was in fair 
condition and was no longer using the hospital's hyperbaric chamber. Toby 
Thrower, 55, of Oak View was "responding well to treatment," a hospital 
spokesman said, but was listed in serious condition in the intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors from the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, or Cal-OSHA, were immediately sent to the accident scene to 
investigate the circumstances of the toxic gas leak, said John Duncan, a 
spokesman for the California Department of Industrial Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a horrible scene," said Larry Bates, Vintage Petroleum's California 
operations manager. "We're still trying to figure out what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vintage Petroleum plant is an oil lease of hundreds of acres in Seacliff, 
about 10 miles north of Ventura. The plant, which employees about a dozen 
workers and another two dozen contract employees, produces about 1,000 barrels 
of crude oil a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal-OSHA, the state agency that oversees worker safety regulations, requires 
that firms drilling in areas known to contain toxic vapors conduct constant 
monitoring of the gases or chemicals, said Gene Glendenning, a Fresno-area 
manager for Cal-OSHA and an expert in oil safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Monitoring is usually done using electronic devices. The monitors sound off an 
alarm before a dangerous concentration of gas is reached, Glendenning said. 
</P>
<P>
 The devices would be able to inform the companies if toxic concentrations are 
common, and consequently, if respiratory equipment is needed. Otherwise, 
Cal-OSHA does not require respiratory equipment unless there has been a 
documented problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were in an area known to have hydrogen sulfide, they should have been 
monitoring the site," Glendenning said. "The firms are expected to do it. They 
are legally required to test that employees are not being overexposed." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear Wednesday if monitoring was being conducted at the site. Paul 
Roden, a production foreman for Vintage Petroleum, said the company did not 
know whether the workers had been wearing protective gear at the time of the 
accident. He said workers are required to wear safety equipment under certain 
circumstances, but was unsure if they had done so in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not positive of the cause," Roden said of the gas leak. "It's still 
under investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning said hydrogen sulfide is dangerous because the smell disappears 
after a few seconds, but the gas remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "People smell the rotten egg smell, then they think it's gone away, but it is 
growing in concentration." 
</P>
<P>
 It paralyses the respiratory system in higher concentrations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil commonly has sulfur in it, and oil can release hydrogen sulfide. 
Refineries regularly remove hydrogen sulfide from oil, but sometimes it escapes 
naturally, said Scott Lynn, a professor of chemical engineering at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hydrogen sulfide is extremely toxic, comparable in toxicity to hydrogen 
cyanide. But because you can smell it in low concentrations, you can often 
detect it early on," Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrogen sulfide fumes were blamed in 1991 for the death of a worker at a Los 
Angeles County paper recycling plant. Earlier this summer, Domtar Gypson Inc. 
agreed to pay $800,000 in fines as a result of that death at its plant in 
Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
 Diluted concentrations of the gas have also been detected in recent months in 
the Los Angeles subway system. Transit and health officials have recommended 
sensors in the stations to give passengers an early warning if the levels 
become dangerous. Even at the low, 9.9 parts per million detected in the 
subway, health officials said the gas could cause headaches, nausea and eye 
irritation.

</P>
<P>
 Toxic fumes killed three people and injured four others Wednesday at an oil 
production plant north of Ventura. Concentrated hydrogen sulfide can cause 
instant death. 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrogen sulfide 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrogen sulfide is a colorless, extremely poisonous gas that has the odor of 
rotten eggs. It is a byproduct of crude oil and can be released into the air 
during drilling for petroleum. It is also used in the manufacturing of 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Effects: An irritant and asphyxiant, it is highly irritating to eyes and 
mucous membranes when inhaled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Low concentration: (20-150 parts per million) causes irritation of eyes; 
slightly higher concentration may cause irritation of upper respiratory tract. 
If exposure is prolonged, pulmonary edema may result. 
</P>
<P>
 * Higher concentration: Slightly higher concentration may cause irritation of 
upper respiratory tract, and if exposure is prolonged, pulmonary edema may 
result. A 30-minute exposure to 500 p.p.m. results in headache, dizziness, 
staggering gait, diarrhea, followed by bronchitis or bronchopneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Very high concentration: Very high amounts paralyze the nervous system. 
Exposures of 800 to 1,000 p.p.m. may be fatal in 30 minutes; high 
concentrations are instantly fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 How Death Can Result 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the exposure level is under 700 p.p.m., the blood can convert the 
gas into a harmless compound. At concentrations above 700 p.p.m., the body 
can't cope with the excess gas, which reaches the brain and causes breathing to 
stop. Suffocation occurs in minutes, unless victim is removed and given 
artificial respiration.

RUSSIA, MOLDOVA AGREE ON TROOP WITHDRAWAL

 Russia and Moldova said Wednesday that they have agreed on a three-year 
timetable for the withdrawal of an estimated 15,000 Russian troops from the 
former Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators who initialed the draft agreement told a news conference here in 
the Moldovan capital that the deal will take effect as soon as the two 
governments approve the text and their leaders sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moldovan deputy foreign minister, Nicolae Osmochescu, said the government 
agreed to the timetable -- longer than it initially wanted -- because military 
experts said this was the minimum period needed to withdraw the Russian troops' 
huge stockpiles of weapons and ammunition.

Q & A; OUTGOING GENTRY REFLECTS ON ACCOMPLISHMENTS, FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert F. Gentry has served on the Laguna Beach City Council since 1982. In 
1983, he announced that he is gay. Gentry, 55, has been a strong advocate of 
environmental protection, neighborhood preservation and gay rights. He led the 
city's effort to pass a domestic partnership ordinance granting gay and lesbian 
couples some of the same rights enjoyed by husbands and wives and a law 
prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. He is associate dean of 
students at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What has it meant to you to be the first openly gay elected official 
in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I am extremely proud that a very diverse community elected me into the 
role of the first openly gay elected person in Orange County. It has given me a 
great deal of confidence and respect for my constituents and a great deal of 
hope about the future of gay and lesbian rights in Orange County and the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What impact do you think your high-profile position has had on gays and 
lesbians countywide? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I would only hope that there may have been at least one person who did not 
feel alone, isolated, devalued because of my profile. If that has been 
accomplished, I am successful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What have you achieved by being open about your sexual orientation? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I hope I have shown that the myths about gays and lesbians are just that, 
myths. That gay and lesbian people can be leaders, be competent, be family 
members, be religious, be professional and be a part of mankind in a way that 
everyone else is. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How have people related differently to you since you came out publicly? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Most people have not related to me differently at all. The relationship 
differences developed when I became more of an advocate for change as opposed 
to just being out, and some people were skeptical of my advocacy and felt I was 
a single-agenda person and therefore were hesitant in supporting me. But no one 
responded differently to me just because of who I am. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What have been the major changes in Orange County's gay community since you 
took office? 
</P>
<P>
 A. There have been many changes, not because I took office but just because of 
the national and local movement. . . . It's not about me, it's about the 
movement. . . . There are currently about 35 gay and lesbian groups in the 
county. In the early '80s there may have been less than a dozen. Most 
candidates for political office have sought support from the gay and lesbian 
community. Issues of discrimination and bias are on the top of most people's 
agendas. . . . We have a major gay pride organization with a very large annual 
event . . . and thousands of individual men and women in Orange County are 
feeling more comfortable about who they are today than they were 10 years ago 
because they have had the courage to come out and be themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. With the county's most vocal proponent of gay rights stepping down, how 
will that affect Laguna Beach and Orange County's gay communities? 
</P>
<P>
 A. It won't. The gay community in Orange County is vibrant and strong and 
articulate and there will be many others to follow me -- in school boards, city 
councils, Board of Supervisors, state Assembly and the Senate -- from the 
county of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What have been your proudest accomplishments as a Laguna Beach city 
councilman? 
</P>
<P>
 A. My proudest accomplishment is being elected three times and being 
successful in developing policies that relate to the environment, human rights 
and the magnificent character of the city of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are the possibilities you may re-enter politics sometime in the 
future? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I have learned never to predict the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How do you view the political changes now taking place in Laguna Beach? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Laguna Beach is a hotbed of political activity; it always has been. Every 
time there's an election, there is a chance for political change. The 
electorate in Laguna Beach tends to understand the agendas of the rich 
out-of-town interests as opposed to the local candidates who want to preserve 
and protect the very special character of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What has caused the increasingly vocal call for a change in the city? 
</P>
<P>
 A. A very active and involved community and a local government that is not 
afraid to tackle very difficult questions and take a stand on very important 
issues.

 China, seeking to end an age-old tradition of discrimination against women, 
has executed eight people in a single day for committing violent crimes against 
them.

FIRES GUT 3 LA HABRA APARTMENTS; BLAZES: ARSON IS SUSPECTED IN THE OUTBREAK, 
WHICH CAUSED AN ESTIMATED $1.3 MILLION IN DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Hours after an early-morning fire gutted her apartment and those of two 
neighbors Wednesday, Tanya Tolmasoff tried to look beyond the crumbled walls, 
blackened furniture and melted television for items she could salvage. 
</P>
<P>
 About all she could find were some potted plants on her patio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured this place would be totaled," said Tolmasoff, who lived in the 
Glencliff Street apartment with her two children. "When I saw the flames coming 
up, I knew it would be totaled." 
</P>
<P>
 Tolmasoff and other residents were awakened just after 2 a.m. by neighbors 
shouting "Fire!" and by someone who drove around the complex parking lot 
honking a car horn. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents stumbled on three fires at different points around the 97-unit 
apartment complex. La Habra fire investigators say the fires appear to have 
been intentionally set, but said they do not know how or why. 
</P>
<P>
 While no residents were hurt, two firefighters were taken to a hospital with 
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The blazes caused an estimated $1.3 million in damage. Three apartment units 
were destroyed, one was heavily damaged and eight others suffered less severe 
damage, city building officials said. Fourteen vehicles parked in the carport 
also were gutted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my baby," said one tearful resident as she came upon the remains of 
her car, the metal melted by 1,400-degree heat. "People teased me because I 
loved that car. But I didn't care." 
</P>
<P>
 Arson investigators on Wednesday morning used a police dog to sniff for signs 
of flammable liquids around the origin points of the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Powell, battalion chief for the La Habra Fire Department, said the 
blazes appear to be the work of an arsonist because they were set in separate 
places. Investigators believe some sort of accelerant was used to start the 
fires, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents reported hearing loud pops and an explosion about the time the 
fires started. Others said they heard tires screeching around the carport. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Sharman Smith said that at least three cars parked in the carport 
have been broken into over the last two weeks. The burglars took various items, 
including the card keys that open gates surrounding the complex and carport. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get out of here without a gate opener," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said investigators have interviewed residents but have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 It took more than 50 firefighters from seven fire departments to extinguish 
the blazes, which were fueled by wood shake roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were fortunate that we didn't have any Santa Ana winds," Powell said. "If 
there had been winds, we probably would have lost the entire complex." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters quickly extinguished one fire at the front of the complex. 
Intense heat from the flames prevented firefighters from immediately containing 
the other two fires, which burned in the back of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, those fires spread from the back carport to apartments above 
them. By morning, several apartments were blackened throughout. Gaping holes in 
the roofs exposed the hot morning sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said her home was spared even though neighbors on both sides of her lost 
their apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the flames, Smith and her son hurried out of their apartment and 
watched the blazes spread from behind fire lines in front of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just stood there and watched the flames go higher and higher," she said. 
"We didn't know if the building was going to be totally gone. . . . It was very 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials credited residents with helping prevent injuries by shouting 
"Fire!" and banging on neighbors' doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a fire at 2 a.m. and have no injuries is really a miracle," Powell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tolmasoff said she knocked at doors throughout the complex in hopes of warning 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 She pounded especially hard on the door of her immediate neighbor, an older 
man. Later in the morning, Tolmasoff said, the man thanked her, saying that he 
was in a deep sleep while the fire burned nearby and that her knocking woke 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three apartments will have to be completely rebuilt, while six of the 
eight damaged units could be occupied again by next week, said Michael Lee, La 
Habra's building official. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Red Cross provided fire victims with food and drink. All families 
left homeless found temporary shelter with friends or neighbors and did not 
need housing from the Red Cross.

STATE OFFICIAL FOUND SLAIN IN HIS HUNTINGTON BEACH HOME; CRIME: GORDAN CRIBBS 
OF FISH AND GAME DEPARTMENT WAS SHOT. A WOMAN IS CRITICAL AFTER APPARENT 
OVERDOSE. POLICE HAVE NO SUSPECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gordan Lynn Cribbs, a high-ranking official for the California Department of 
Fish and Game, was found shot to death Wednesday afternoon in his home on a 
quiet cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency personnel, responding to a call that an unidentified woman had been 
found unconscious inside Cribbs' home, discovered Cribbs' body shortly before 3 
p.m. Wednesday, said Sgt. Chuck Thomas of the Huntington Beach Police 
Department. Cribbs was pronounced dead at the scene from a gunshot wound to the 
torso, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics treated the woman at the scene for an apparent drug overdose and 
transported her to Pacifica Hospital, where she was reported in critical 
condition Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Police refused to identify her and said they had no suspects in Cribbs' 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's terrible," said Cheryl Heffley, a wildlife biologist with the state 
Fish and Game Department when informed of Cribbs' death. "I can't believe it. 
He was a hard-working man, an honest fellow. You could count on him to make a 
reasonable decision under pressure. He always struck me as a fair and honest 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 Heffley said that Cribbs' wife, Ardith, was a secretary with Fish and Game 
until she was laid off within the last month. The couple shared a home in the 
8700 block of Elgin Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Cribbs was patrol chief for the Fish and Game region that stretched from Santa 
Barbara to the Mexican border. As a sworn peace officer, the 49-year-old Cribbs 
was authorized to carry a sidearm while on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Elgin Circle was closed off by yellow police tape Wednesday afternoon as 
investigators went house-to-house interviewing neighbors, several of whom stood 
on their lawns chatting quietly. Outside Cribbs' beige home were two vehicles, 
one registered to Cribbs and a second registered to the state Department of 
Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cribbs had been active in efforts to protect area wildlife, particularly those 
threatened by Caltrans projects, such as the red fox and endangered species of 
tortoises. 
</P>
<P>
 He taught wildlife law enforcement at Orange Coast College. In the early 
1980s, one of his students was John Fallan, now a warden with the state Fish 
and Game Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a decent person," Fallan said. "I was just out of high school and 
wanted to be a game warden. He was very helpful and very encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was unable to join Fish and Game, Fallan joined the California Highway 
Patrol but stayed in touch with Cribbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always very pleasant," Fallan said. "He never forgot me, and always 
had a word of encouragement for me."

RAMS HOLD OFF TALKS WITH ST. LOUIS ON MOVE; SPORTS: DISPUTE AMONG OWNERS OF 
CITY'S NEW, DOMED STADIUM IS CITED. THOSE SEEKING TO KEEP THE TEAM IN ANAHEIM 
TAKE HEART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 John Shaw, executive vice president of the Rams, had a message Wednesday for 
St. Louis officials trying to lure the National Football League team to 
Missouri: You had better get your act together. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued through his public relations firm, Shaw said, "The Rams 
have decided to hold off on negotiations with St. Louis until they've resolved 
their lease issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw's comment could be a mere ploy to pressure St. Louis, where a dispute 
between owners of the lease on a new, 70,000-seat domed stadium could prevent a 
football team from playing there in 1995. But it still sparked optimism in 
offices around Orange County, which is staging a major effort to keep the Rams, 
and Baltimore, which has been courting the team for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that puts off or delays a decision is obviously good news for those 
of us trying to keep the Rams in Orange County," said Jack Lindquist, the 
former Disneyland president who is co-chairing the Save the Rams Task Force. 
"Every day that passes that no decision has been made to move means they're 
still there. That's encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of baseball's Baltimore Orioles, Peter Angelos, who is attempting to 
purchase a minority interest in the Rams, seemed delighted that the team is 
frustrated with St. Louis, which also blew a shot at landing an NFL expansion 
team last year, in part because of conflicts over potential ownership groups as 
well as the stadium lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let them be mad at St. Louis -- they shouldn't go there," Angelos said. 
"Baltimore is a much better football town, and the opportunity for the Rams 
here would be far more beneficial than the one in St. Louis." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis responded by announcing that Thomas Eagleton, a former U.S. senator 
and short-lived running mate of Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern 
in 1972, has been named chairman of FANS Inc. (Football At the New Stadium), 
the nonprofit group that has been trying to secure an NFL team for the new, 
$258-million stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was formed by St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr. and St. Louis 
County Executive George (Buzz) Westfall, who this week revealed details of a 
Rams wish list that included payment of $30 million the team still owes for 
Anaheim Stadium improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 A St. Louis source said that Rams officials were unhappy about the disclosure 
of many of the items on the wish, and that they would be more comfortable 
dealing with someone in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county officials acted quickly, replacing Westfall with Eagleton as 
point man in negotiations with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a lawyer practicing in St. Louis, Eagleton is best remembered nationally 
as the man who was dropped from the McGovern ticket in the days following the 
1972 Democratic National Convention after the disclosure of a history of 
psychiatric care. It did not hurt his popularity in Missouri; he was reelected 
to the Senate by a landslide two years later and then served a third term 
before retiring in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed a person outside of government whose efforts could be focused 
directly on the issues at hand," said Mac Scott, Westfall's director of 
communications. "Tom was available and expressed an interest. He may be just 
the thing we need to take care of these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problems center on St. Louis beer distributor Jerry Clinton, who controls 
30% of the new stadium lease and does not appear willing to turn over his share 
to FANS, which controls 65%. The remaining 5% is owned by two smaller 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who hopes to become an NFL owner, at one point demanded $8 million 
for his share, but a source said he has increased the price to $20 million. 
FANS offered $3.5 million to buy him out several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease dissolves in 1997, at which point it would revert to the St. Louis 
Stadium Authority. But if FANS can't come to terms with Clinton, an NFL team 
moving to St. Louis would be forced to play the 1995 and '96 seasons in Busch 
Stadium, which has 54,000 seats and no luxury suites, a potential major source 
of revenue for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating matters is that Clinton has had numerous discussions with 
Shaw, independent of the efforts Westfall and Bosley have made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not all on the same page on the deal, which is unfortunate," Scott 
said. "And we're no closer with him (on settling the lease)." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but he told the St. Louis 
Post-Dispatch earlier this week that he is willing to deal his share of the 
lease "to whatever extent it is necessary. And if that is 100% of my portion, 
then it's 100%, if that's what it takes to get a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "But John Shaw indicated he was willing to have me as a partner in this deal. 
I would be represented by some of my 30%, but not all. And that's fine with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 In related news, sports agent Leigh Steinberg, Save the Rams Task Force 
co-chairman, said his group will present a formal proposal to keep the team in 
Orange County to Shaw and Rams owner Georgia Frontiere privately by Aug. 26 and 
make it public at a later date.

GRAND JURY ASKS D.A. TO REVIEW LEASES AT MARINA; DEVELOPMENT: IT WANTS GARCETTI 
TO DETERMINE IF LAWS WERE BROKEN OR PROCEDURES IGNORED IN NEGOTIATION OF 
LONG-TERM DEALS FOR PRIME REAL ESTATE.

<P>
 The Los Angeles County Grand Jury has called for the district attorney to 
investigate long-term leases that the county granted to private developers on 
choice waterfront property in Marina del Rey, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury wants Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti to determine if any laws were 
broken or procedures ignored when the county renegotiated leases on valuable 
county-owned marina property in 1989, according to two members of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county was a loser in each one of these leases," said one grand juror, 
who asked not to be identified. "Was it ignorance, stupidity or duplicity?" 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the district attorney said Garcetti had not received the 
grand jury's request and would have no comment. Grand jury adviser Terry White, 
a deputy district attorney, said he has not had time to prepare the formal 
referral to the district attorney but plans to do so in the near future. He 
added that the district attorney is not obligated to act on a grand jury 
referral. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury, which finished its term June 30, stated in its final report 
that it had conducted a preliminary investigation into the marina. Two grand 
jurors said the panel decided the leases warranted further examination and 
voted to refer the case to the district attorney in part because members felt 
they lacked the expertise to evaluate the complex agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Marina del Rey is owned by Los Angeles County, which leases it on a 
long-term, generally 60-year, basis to a small group of developers who operate 
the harbor's apartments, hotels, boat slips, restaurants and shops. The vast 
majority of the marina properties are controlled by a handful of developers, 
who also have been significant campaign contributors to the county Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 A yearlong Times study of the marina published in April, 1992, found that the 
partnership between the county and the leaseholders had primarily benefited the 
developers at the expense of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent real estate experts consulted by The Times concluded that the 
marina leases were generating far less rental income for the county than they 
should given the value of the prime waterfront property. The experts also said 
the county made a big financial concession to the leaseholders when new rent 
levels were negotiated in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, who challenged The Times' conclusions, have said the 
renegotiated rents were the best they could obtain after years of deadlock with 
the leaseholders. The county's income from apartments and boat slips was 
adjusted upward, although not as high as recommended earlier by appraisers for 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury stated in its report that it had conducted a preliminary 
inquiry into a citizen complaint alleging "improprieties" in granting leases in 
Marina del Rey. The report said "one aspect" of that inquiry should be referred 
to the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 That aspect, according to the grand jury sources, is whether the leases are 
legal and the negotiations were properly conducted. The grand jurors asked not 
to be identified because they are prohibited from talking about their 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury also referred the marina issue to the newly installed 1994-1995 
grand jury for consideration, according to interviews and documents obtained by 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to be sure that the (lease) process was fair and legal," said one 
grand juror. "Mostly that it was legal." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's negotiations on the marina leases were overseen by former Chief 
Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon, who left county service in a cloud of 
controversy over changes in the pension plan last year, and County Counsel 
DeWitt Clinton. Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who at the time was a 
private attorney, was hired by the county to assist in the negotiations. The 
Board of Supervisors also played a critical role in shaping the county's marina 
leasing policy, especially Supervisor Deane Dana, who represents the marina 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can always argue if it was a good deal or not," said Dixon, when told of 
the grand jury action. But he said he does not believe any laws were violated. 
Clinton could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said in a prepared statement that he negotiated a good deal for county 
taxpayers that resulted in significantly increased rental income. "This action, 
like any other involving a public body, is rightly subject to thorough review 
and scrutiny," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 When told of the grand jury's referral to the district attorney, Dana said, 
"It's all right with me. I don't think they'll find anything very startling." 
Dana said the county's lease arrangements have been successful for the 30 years 
since the marina was created and he is satisfied the leases are legal and their 
terms are fair to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina, who has been critical of the leases, said she will 
personally encourage Garcetti to vigorously pursue the grand jury's referral. 
"I've had concerns from day one. We have private people gaining tremendous 
benefit from a public resource." 
</P>
<P>
 The big leaseholders who collectively control about two-thirds of the marina 
include: lobbyist/attorney Douglas Ring and his uncle, Ellis Ring; developer 
Jona Goldrich; developer Jerome Snyder, whose marina holdings are now in 
bankruptcy court; developer Jerry Epstein, who has served on numerous 
government commissions, and Saudi Arabian investor Abdul Aziz al Ibrahim, a 
brother-in-law of Saudi King Fahd. 
</P>
<P>
 Another longtime marina developer, Abraham Lurie, who sold 49.9% of his 
holdings to the Saudi investors in 1989, later lost his share of the marina 
leases in a bankruptcy court battle with his partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie had no comment, but said he would be willing to meet with the grand jury 
to discuss his views of the marina. Snyder said his Marina City Club holdings 
were not covered by the 1989 rent renegotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Ring said he was not involved when the original leases were signed, 
but the grand jury is welcome to look into the rent renegotiation issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldrich said county negotiators "drove a real tough bargain . . . I don't see 
where the grand jury is going to find something wrong with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury opened its inquiry into the marina as a result of a complaint 
by John Rizzo, a longtime Marina del Rey activist. He presented the grand jury 
with a videotape in which he was sharply critical of the county's 
administration of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape was "very good" and the complaint was "very comprehensive," according 
to another grand juror. "He's got some good points." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's Government Operations Committee began assembling a file on the 
controversial topic, but was unable to complete its investigation because of 
the press of other business, budgetary restraints and a concern the panel had a 
conflict of interest because one member is an officer in a marina yacht club, 
according to several members. Also, some members felt they had to hand it off 
to the district attorney because they did not have the necessary expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing was so complex," said one juror. 
</P>
<P>
 White said the panel presented him with five volumes of notes concerning the 
marina that he must review and condense into a formal referral to the district 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is a panel of 23 citizens appointed for a one-year term by the 
Superior Court to hear criminal cases and determine whether there is sufficient 
evidence to return an indictment. The grand jury is also charged with serving 
as a guardian against improper or inefficient performance by county government. 
It has wide statutory powers of inquiry and investigation.

YOUTH IN VIDEO BEATING SUES FOR $10 MILLION; COURTS: FELIPE SOLTERO, 17, OF 
COMPTON FILES A FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAWSUIT. THE OFFICER'S ATTORNEY SAYS HIS 
CLIENT WAS ATTACKED AND HAD TO USE FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A teen-ager who was beaten by a Compton police officer filed a $10-million 
federal civil rights suit Wednesday, while the policeman's attorney countered 
that the officer had to use force because the youth had attacked him first. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange of charges, at a pair of news conferences, marked the latest 
round in the controversy that erupted after a videotape showing part of the 
July 29 confrontation was aired on television. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape, shot by a neighbor who witnessed the confrontation from inside his 
nearby trailer, depicted 17-year-old Felipe Soltero speaking with Officer 
Michael Jackson before Jackson smacked him with his police baton, jumped on his 
back, handcuffed him and then dragged him to the squad car by his handcuff 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth's lawyer later said Soltero had become angry after a social worker 
from the Department of Children's Services showed up at his home to investigate 
a complaint of child neglect, and to round up Soltero's siblings. When the 
youth told the social worker to go away, she called the police, the lawyer 
said. When the teen-ager confronted Jackson as well, he said, the officer beat 
and arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday, lawyer George Franscell, who is representing the police officer 
and Compton, said the videotape did not tell the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
 As proof, Franscell produced a tape of a 911 call from another neighbor of 
Soltero's family. In that tape, James Murillo reports that "there's an officer 
out there fighting with somebody . . . and the sister walked up to him and hit 
him too." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer said Murillo later explained to an investigator that "the police 
officer was overcome and could not control (the youth)." 
</P>
<P>
 Franscell also held up the uniform he said Jackson was wearing at the time of 
the encounter, which had a ripped breast pocket and a tear in the knee that he 
said occurred in the scuffle. He said the dirt on the uniform showed that the 
officer had been on the ground during the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a fight and the officer was on the ground and the officer was 
losing the fight," Franscell said. "The officer had to use these types of 
force." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the lawyer presented a man he identified as a videotape expert, 
who questioned the validity of the tape, which was initially aired by KNBC-TV. 
Norman Perle -- who appeared on another videotape being interviewed by Compton 
police -- said the beginning of the amateur video may have been erased, and 
that some audio alterations may have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said, contrary to claims made by the youth, that the tape showed no 
blows to Soltero's head, and that it appeared Soltero tried at one point to 
fight back by aiming a "karate kick" at Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Perle, whose operation -- National Audio/Video Forensic Laboratory -- is run 
out of an office in his Northridge home, has testified in several high-profile 
cases. His credentials, however, have been repeatedly attacked in court. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when Perle testified in the defense of Damian Monroe Williams, 
convicted in the beating Reginald O. Denny during the riots, it was revealed on 
cross-examination that Perle had made false claims on his resume and had lied 
about his academic credentials. Franscell -- who is himself well-known for his 
work defending police officers against charges of misconduct -- said he was 
presenting Perle's analysis because "I was enraged by what I saw on Channel 4 
and how distorted it was." 
</P>
<P>
 The youth's lawyer, Humberto Guizar, said the authenticity of the videotape 
will be proven when the case goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Soltero's suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, alleges that "in a 
scene reminiscent of the events now referred to as the 'Rodney King beating,' " 
Soltero was "brutally attacked and terrorized " by Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, the suit says, beat the teen-ager "repeatedly . . . about his 
head and body with a police baton" and stomped on him with his knee after 
Soltero "refused to permit" a social worker to take his siblings into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Compton city officials continued to cope with the fallout from the 
incident, which -- because it was between a black officer and a Latino 
immigrant -- struck a nerve in the racially mixed community. Although the 
city's power structure is dominated by African Americans, the Latino population 
has increased to about 51% of the city's residents, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Omar Bradley, who greeted the press with a group of black city officials 
and Latino community leaders at his side, said the city attorney had been 
forced to cancel a town hall meeting that had been scheduled on the topic this 
week because officials had "received information that there could be violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said he hoped to set a date for the discussions today, and the city's 
lone Latino elected official, school board trustee Gorgonio Sanchez, said he 
will help put together a Latino affairs commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Shawn Hubler and community correspondent Emily Adams 
contributed to this report.

INVENTING THE FUTURE; UCLA SCIENTIST WHO HELPED CREATE INTERNET ISN'T DONE YET 
</P>

 He was there at the start -- the day the very first message landed on the 
information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Nov. 21, 1969, and Leonard Kleinrock made one last check of the system 
that he had come up with to let computers talk to each other over telephone 
lines instead of waiting for magnetic tapes or punch cards to be exchanged by 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment was stuffed inside a refrigerator-size cabinet in the middle of 
Room 3420 at UCLA's Boelter Hall. Computer science professor Kleinrock and 
several graduate students watched anxiously as a brief "are you receiving 
this?" query was typed into an IBM Selectric typewriter keyboard wired to the 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later came the reply from a lone computer about 400 miles away in San 
Francisco: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a blink of an eye, the Internet was born. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, there are millions of users instead of only two. And the man who 
helped invent the Internet 25 years ago is trying to help reinvent it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kleinrock, 60, is in Washington today to brief Department of Education 
officials on ways that the Internet could be a model for an information 
superhighway linking computer, cable television, telephone and broadcast 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideas have come from a 16-member National Information Infrastructure panel 
of scientists, communications industry officials and academicians headed by 
Kleinrock for the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has sketched out the basic framework for a future computer 
network accessible to all, yet sophisticated enough to adapt to future 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do it right, we can fold in everything -- entertainment, science, 
business, you name it, into one network," Kleinrock said. "We envision 
something serving not only the nutty scientist or the couch potato, but the 
business world as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of hooking computers together so researchers could share ideas 
sounded wacky to many scientists the Saturday before Labor Day in 1969. That is 
when what has become known as Internet Node No. 1 was wheeled into Kleinrock's 
UCLA lab. 
</P>
<P>
 The clunky, $100,000 machine, called an interface message processor, was 
designed to translate commands between computer mainframes built by Honeywell, 
Burroughs, IBM and Digital. It needed special "packet-switching" technology 
promoted by Kleinrock to connect computers that were miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine had been commissioned by the federal government's Advanced 
Research Projects Agency, an organization set up in 1958 in response to the 
Soviets' launch of the Sputnik satellite the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Defense-sponsored agency supported computer researchers 
scattered nationwide. By the late 1960s, the agency began looking for a way to 
save money by letting the growing group of scientists share computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting project, dubbed Arpanet, would eventually evolve into the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Kleinrock was recruited to help after writing an MIT graduate school thesis on 
an obscure topic called "data networks." It had been published as a book a year 
before Kleinrock joined the UCLA faculty in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 "Len was the best one in the country to do it," said Larry Roberts, now a 
Foster City, Calif., research executive who was in charge of Arpanet 
development in the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists say packet-switching is a procedure in which data is partitioned 
into small bundles. Each carries its own delivery address and travels through 
the data network independently to its destination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of it as freeways being the lines and cars being the packets," said 
Vinton Cerf, a communication company executive who heads the nonprofit Internet 
Society -- and who was one of those present in Room 3420 the day the Internet 
was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerf, now of Reston, Va., was a graduate student at the time who was working 
on the software that pumped data in and out of Node No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the Arpanet project started, it was Len whose theoretical work showed 
that the concept of store-and-forward switching actually made sense," Cerf 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kleinrock -- who received the 1982 Ericsson Prize (considered by some the 
Nobel Prize of telecommunications) from the King of Sweden -- credits Superman 
for starting his career. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was 6 when he spied plans for a homemade crystal radio set in a 
Superman comic book centerfold. He scrounged up the parts and assembled them. 
And when it worked, he found himself hooked on electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was hooked at first on the concept of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first few months, the Advanced Research Projects Agency's computer 
network consisted solely of outlets at UCLA, the Stanford Research Institute, 
UC Santa Barbara and the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd figured that by 1974 it would be pretty widespread," but it wasn't, said 
Robert Taylor, a former agency computer research administrator who is now with 
a Palo Alto computer firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wanted to connect to the network. They were afraid their machines 
would be overloaded by network users," Kleinrock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Node No. 1 was replaced with faster equipment in the late 1970s. UCLA offered 
to donate it to the Smithsonian in 1989. "But they said no. Now the Smithsonian 
wants it and we've said no," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kleinrock, a Brentwood resident, said he spends about 30 hours a week using 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still a research tool for people such as the Bombay professor appealing 
this week for data on "Bacillus subtilis genomic" or the Florida 
horticulturists growing "beer-drinking orchids." But it also posts tasteless 
jokes, political dissertations and games. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the information superhighway is just beginning, Kleinrock said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know where this is heading," he said. "We didn't know 25 years ago. 
And we don't know now. We're feeling our way in a new world."

CORONER AIDE'S OUTBURST BROKE NO LAWS, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police detectives have completed a brief investigation of a deputy 
medical examiner in the O.J. Simpson case and concluded that he broke no laws 
in an outburst after his testimony during last month's preliminary hearing, law 
enforcement officials and other sources close to the case said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical examiner, Dr. Irwin Golden, was subjected to intense 
cross-examination duringthe preliminary hearing. Defense attorney Robert L. 
Shapiro ridiculed his credentials and his handling of the coroner's 
investigation into the June 12 deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks after that testimony, sources said, Golden brandished something 
that looked like a gun in a common area of the coroner's office and shouted 
words to the effect of: "This is all you need to take out six or seven 
lawyers!" Another source said the doctor added: "Death to lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD was informed of the outburst by coroner's officials shortly after it 
happened and investigated it to determine whether Golden had broken any laws, 
which could have included such charges as illegally brandishing a weapon or 
carrying a concealed weapon. Golden is a forensic pathology instructor who uses 
props and weapons to teach students, and investigators concluded that the gun 
could have been a prop or an unloaded weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments appeared to be meant as a joke, sources familiar with the 
investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators presented the evidence to the city attorney's office, and 
lawyers there determined that there did not appear to be any violation of the 
law. The district attorney's office was not consulted about the decision 
whether to file charges because the incident was not considered a possible 
felony, sources added. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden is on vacation and efforts to reach him for comment over the past 
several days have been unsuccessful. Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the 
coroner's office, said he had no knowledge of any investigation into Golden and 
that if Golden's actions were the subject of any internal inquiry, it would be 
a personnel matter and he could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, Los Angeles police Cmdr. David J. Gascon confirmed that police 
investigated Golden but stressed that the case is closed.

FAMILIES OF 2 QUAKE VICTIMS BATTLE OVER ESTATE; COURTS: RELATIVES HAVE FILED A 
POSTHUMOUS PALIMONY COMPLAINT. THOSE WHO SOLD THE COUPLE THEIR DREAM HOME ALSO 
FACE SUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They lived with all the usual fast-lane L.A. trappings -- jobs in "the 
industry," a distinctive hillside house, luxury cars, no marriage certificate. 
Then they lost everything, including their lives, when the house slid down a 
hillside in the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the deaths of Marc Yobs and Karen Osterholt have given rise to another 
part of the lifestyle: an avalanche of litigation, including a posthumous 
palimony complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterholt's family is suing Yobs' relations for a share of his estate, 
including the collapsed Sherman Oaks house, some quake-damaged antiques, and 
his $300,000 life-insurance policy. In addition, both sets of surviving 
relatives are pursuing separate lawsuits against the people who sold the couple 
their dream home on Sherwood Place. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal evidence is expected to include coroner's reports on the couple's Jan. 
17 deaths because Osterholt was the sole beneficiary of Yobs' life-insurance 
policy -- but only if she survived him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a dispute -- and this is kind of gruesome," warned attorney Jane 
Grilliot, "over whether they died simultaneously or who lived longer." 
</P>
<P>
 If she died first or at the same time, the policy's $300,000 proceeds would 
become part of his estate, to be claimed by his relatives. But if he died 
first, the insurance money would then be hers, becoming part of her estate to 
be parceled out to her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Grilliot, who represents Osterholt's estate against the house's sellers, said 
she was unable to comment further on the rift between the families. And lawyers 
for the rival estates also refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to court documents and other sources, the palimony dispute arose 
in the months after the couple were buried side-by-side and because Osterholt's 
parents received none of Yobs' life insurance settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterholt and Yobs, both San Fernando Valley natives, were working in the 
entertainment industry when they died. Osterholt, 30, had recently begun 
working as a receptionist at Mark Goodson Productions after a longtime job 
waiting tables. Yobs, 32, was an account manager for The Post Group, a film 
production company where he had worked his way up over the course of 6 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a suit filed May 4 in Los Angeles Superior Court, Osterholt's mother, 
Eileen Waldrop, who is also administrator of Osterholt's estate, alleges that 
the Prudential Life Insurance Company of America ignored the estate's claims 
and wrongfully gave the insurance money to the Yobs family, in part because 
Yobs' mother is a Prudential employee. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit notes that under state law, when an insured person and the only named 
beneficiary die together, insurance proceeds revert to the insured's estate. 
But the suit contends there is medical evidence that Osterholt survived in the 
ruins longer than Yobs, making her estate eligible to get the money. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Osterholt's relatives, Robert S. Waldo of Camarillo, would not 
elaborate on the court record. Similarly, a lawyer representing the Yobs 
family, Martin C. Bobak of Los Angeles, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yobs' older brother, Dave, challenged the suit's central claim that 
Osterholt lived longer, saying it is based on a questionable review of 
coroner's reports by a privately retained physician. No autopsies were 
performed on Yobs or Osterholt, Dave Yobs said, adding that the suit has been a 
blow to his grieving parents, Margaret and Henry. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents don't deserve or need to be going through this," said Dave Yobs of 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Yobs also challenged a second suit filed last month that demands a share 
of his brother's estate for Osterholt's survivors, contending that Osterholt 
sacrificed her own interests to help support Yobs as he pursued his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they began living together, the suit says, Osterholt "continued to work 
as a waitress, giving up opportunities for education and opportunities to 
advance in a career, in order to devote her entire skills, efforts, labors, and 
earnings, to maintaining the household for (Yobs), including doing all 
necessary housekeeping and related chores, including shopping . . . and 
maintaining social skills with friends and acquaintances and providing 
companionship to (Yobs)." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agree Osterholt never held title to the house, which was purchased 
in February, 1992, for $400,000 in Yobs' name. But the palimony suit says the 
two "cohabitants" of nearly eight years had an oral agreement to share 
everything equally. In an interview, Grilliot said, "We do know that funds from 
both parties were used to purchase the house. We're still trying to figure out 
how much each contributed." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Yobs said his brother paid for the house on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really irritated that (the suit claims) she was entitled to half of his 
house," said Dave Yobs, a real estate agent who represented his brother in the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't qualify for the house. Her income wasn't used to help qualify for 
it. My brother bought it as a single man, the title was very specific on it. 
She didn't put in one dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a receptionist at Mark Goodson and got her foot through the door 
through my brother. My brother helped get her a job there." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Yobs also disagreed with the length of time his brother had actually 
lived with Osterholt, saying the pair had an on-again, off-again relationship 
until Yobs bought the house. Yobs -- memorialized in the credits of the action 
film "Speed" -- also paid for his Porsche and the BMW that Osterholt drove, 
Dave Yobs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterholt's parents, Waldrop and Gerold Osterholt, could not be reached for 
comment. A sister, Lisa Silechio of Pasadena, said family lawyers had told her 
not to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate legal actions, both families are suing the attorney and his 
business partners who sold the house to Yobs, claiming they suppressed a 
crucial engineering report that warned of structural flaws in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the twin suits claim, a would-be buyer named James Malmberg backed 
out after receiving the unfavorable report from an engineer he hired to review 
the property. After that, the defendants switched escrow companies and real 
estate agents "and anyone who knew about the report" before selling the house 
to Yobs, the Yobs family's attorney, Alexander Robertson IV, said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants also set up two dummy corporations -- Properties Du Monde Inc. 
and Danat Investment -- to hold title to the house and insulate themselves from 
responsibility for the damaging engineering report, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits name as defendants attorney and real estate investor Lawrence R. 
Gordon; his alleged partner and contractor Richard Robinson and Robinson's wife 
Margarette; Properties Du Monde Inc.; the Danat Investment Co.; and two more 
alleged business partners of Gordon's, Daniel J. Eget and Nathan J. Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 None could be reached for comment.

WOODSTOCK COVER GIRL; VALLEY WOMAN WHO SYMBOLIZED THE ERA STILL KEEPS THE FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER and FRANK MANNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 She was 22, stoned, and dancing on her knees with a boy named Fantuzzi when 
the photographer from Life magazine captured a glowing Joan Bryant at 
Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the grainy black-and-white became a symbol, a summary, of all that 
was pure and all that was impure about the hippie era: free love, cheap dope, 
wide-eyed kids searching anywhere and everywhere for a way out of 1950s 
conservatism and the growing horror in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 25th anniversary of the seminal hippie celebration, the photo is being 
replayed on the cover of the Aug. 8 issue of Newsweek. And for Bryant, now a 
Woodland Hills resident, the past has come rushing back. The cover photo has 
brought a wave of media types, curious about a 47-year-old grandmother who owns 
a fashionable Malibu boutique and a French poodle named Pierre and is once 
again the poster child of a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that you can change the world with love -- we thought that was 
true," Bryant said. "I still think that's true." 
</P>
<P>
 At her shop Wednesday morning, Bryant entertained reporters, answered media 
calls and conducted phone interviews with radio stations as far away as 
Scranton, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek was due in the afternoon for a 25-years-later photo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so surprising that people care what I have to say," she said. "But I 
guess it's part of the nostalgia." 
</P>
<P>
 More than half a million people grooved to Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix and 
avoided the tainted "Orange Sunshine" LSD at Woodstock. But now everyone seems 
to be looking to her for an answer to the proverbial question: Where are they 
now? 
</P>
<P>
 In Bryant's case, more than 3,000 miles from Woodstock. Which sometimes seems 
like an impossible distance, and sometimes just around the corner. As the 
Grateful Dead would say: What a long, strange trip it's been. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago, Bryant was married, had two children and was studying 
costume design in college when she and a girlfriend hitched a ride from 
Bloomington, Ind., to Max Yasgur's dairy farm in Upstate New York. Somewhere in 
between stops at a vegetarian food stand and through the purple haze, she 
stumbled on Luiz Fantuzzi, an acquaintance from Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a bronze, exotic figure, and he only wore loincloths," Bryant recalled 
with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 The two got high, and far in the back of the crowd where it was difficult to 
hear the featured performers, began their sensual dance to the rhythm of an 
impromptu jam session. Bryant says she was so close to Nirvana she hardly 
noticed the photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 She said goodby to Fantuzzi -- not to hear from him again until the Newsweek 
fanfare began -- and rejoined her husband. Fantuzzi called her when he saw the 
magazine cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just heard my voice and said 'Louie?' I had never even said my name," 
said Fantuzzi, who keeps an answering machine in Topanga and is a traveling 
musician. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant's first marriage eventually ended and her ex-husband and her 
hitchhiking girlfriend later married. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave each other a great deal of freedom," Bryant said. "As I look back, 
that part failed." 
</P>
<P>
 She came West in 1975 to pursue a career in film costuming and, like so many 
other Woodstock alumni, settled into a more traditional life. 
</P>
<P>
 Now married 17 years to a politically conservative computer consultant, Bryant 
has traded in her love beads for a 2 1/2-carat diamond wedding ring, and her 
Cadillac-cum-camper for a Ford Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 "A mommy-mobile -- that's what my kids call it." 
</P>
<P>
 After 25 years and many miles -- and no plans to be among the 250,000 expected 
to attend this weekend's Woodstock reunion -- Bryant says she remains true to 
many of the Woodstock ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 Still a vegetarian and clad this day in a flowing dress printed with ethereal 
sea creatures, she speaks of angels and cosmic forces, of searching for the 
human thread of goodness. Her shop, Indiana Joan's, smells of fresh flowers and 
sings with Chilean flute music. And in between such celebrity customers as 
Shirley MacLaine, she crafts jewelry and hat boxes of discarded goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more disciplined and more focused now, and that's very different than in 
those early years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think in my heart, I'm still a love child."

3 DOCTORS CITED IN TAYLOR DRUG CASE; MEDICINE: THE PHYSICIANS RECEIVE 
REPRIMANDS FOR PRESCRIBING EXCESSIVE MEDICATION TO TREAT THE ACTRESS'S PAIN. 
THEIR ATTORNEYS SAY THE DECISION IS AN EXONERATION. 
</P>

<P>
 Three prominent Los Angeles physicians have been reprimanded by the Medical 
Board of California for falsifying patient records to cover up the massive 
amounts of addictive drugs they prescribed to actress Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions, yet to be publicly released, bring to a close the accusations 
filed against the doctors in 1990 by the attorney general's office, alleging 
that the physicians prescribed excessive doses of painkillers to Taylor during 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the matter was brought to a close by the medical board, the 
settlement reignited a long-simmering controversy over the state's disciplinary 
system for doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the doctors said the reprimand amounted to an exoneration of 
three dedicated physicians who were trying to control Taylor's pain and kept 
inaccurate medical records only to protect the actress from the prying eyes of 
reporters for tabloids such as the National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 Harland Braun, attorney for Dr. Michael S. Gottlieb, said: "This letter (of 
reprimand) says nothing. It's an administrative fig leaf covering the board's 
private parts. . . . It ought to be labeled a letter of apology." 
</P>
<P>
 A public interest watchdog group in San Diego questioned whether the 
reprimand, which is intended for minor infractions, was an appropriate 
sanction. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical board officials said the action was appropriate and avoided the 
"circus" atmosphere of formal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, medical board officials had pressed to suspend or revoke the 
doctors' licenses. They had rejected as too lenient an offer by the doctors to 
go on probation and perform community service. Then, executive director Dixon 
Arnett decided last month to mete out the mildest punishment possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision comes as the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has initiated 
legal action to determine whether to revoke the authority of two of the doctors 
to handle controlled substances. The DEA action against Gottlieb has been 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb, of Sherman Oaks, is the immunologist who reported the first AIDS 
case in the United States. The case also involves his former partner, Dr. 
Michael J. Roth, and Dr. William F. Skinner, who served until recently as the 
director of the chemical dependency unit at St. John's Hospital and Health 
Center in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are three doctors that have a tremendous reputation in the community 
and a great background," said Donald Goldman, Skinner's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her doctor-patient relationship, Taylor shared with Roth and 
Gottlieb a dedication to the AIDS movement. The actress was not identified in 
the reprimand or the accusation, but her name was revealed during legal 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Her case was brought to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office in 
the late 1980s by officials of a detoxification center where she sought 
treatment. After an 18-month inquiry, the district attorney declined to press 
criminal charges but issued a report in April, 1990, stating that "the 
prescribing practices of these physicians fell below the accepted standard of 
medical practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Several months later, the attorney general's office filed a formal accusation 
charging that the doctors had written Taylor more than 1,000 prescriptions 
during a five-year period dating back to 1983 for 28 controlled substances, 
including sleeping pills, painkillers and tranquilizers. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges, totaling about 80 pages, include an exhaustive list of drugs 
prescribed in various combinations, both by tablet and by self-injection. 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Earl Plowman, who supervised the drafting of the complaint, 
recalled that when a medical expert first looked at the case, he assumed that 
the patient must be dead because "the dosages were incompatible with life." 
</P>
<P>
 Plowman recalled: "This was a rather systematic effort by the doctors to keep 
a patient supplied with drugs. . . . It was a classic case of abuse involving 
multiple prescriptions, multiple controlled substances at different pharmacies 
at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who has undergone several spinal surgeries, has a history of back, 
neck and leg pain. Her publicist in New York said she was unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said drug dosages that would be excessive for most people were 
appropriate to combat Taylor's discomfort and allow her to function. 
</P>
<P>
 "Liz Taylor is a different patient, with intractable, long-term, untreatable 
pain," Braun said. "She has no life without painkillers." He added that the 
doctors did not accurately record the drugs she was given "to protect her from 
ending up in the National Enquirer." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman concurred: "You see what comes out in the tabloid press these days and 
you can see very clearly why they (the doctors) did it." 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, this case has taken an inordinately long time to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 The conclusion comes as the board, long criticized for slow and lenient 
discipline of doctors, is struggling to recover from a 1993 scandal that 
erupted after disclosures that officials had closed, and shredded, complaints 
without proper investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the Legislature has given the board additional tools to discipline 
doctors, including the ability to cite and fine them and to issue reprimands 
instead of pressing charges for minor infractions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Taylor's doctors, Julianne D'Angelo, at the Center for Public 
Interest Law at the University of San Diego, questioned the fundamental 
legitimacy of the letter of reprimand. She said the board has not yet passed 
regulations setting forth the criteria for issuing the reprimands. Furthermore, 
she said, unless the offense is "a minor unprofessional-conduct violation," a 
reprimand is an inappropriate sanction. 
</P>
<P>
 Without commenting on the final action, Deputy Atty. Gen. Plowman, said: "I 
certainly wouldn't have called these charges minor." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnett, the medical board's executive director, defended the reprimands as 
appropriate and legally sound. He said the doctors agreed to accept the 
reprimands as part of the settlement, which is permissible despite the lack of 
published regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the reprimand was appropriate, given the difficulty of prevailing in 
court as well as his desire to avoid the atmosphere of high-profile 
proceedings. "We decided a stipulation was better than a circus," Arnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reprimands will have virtually no effect on the doctors' practices. The 
letters do not have to be posted in their offices and will not be entered into 
a national database that tracks disciplinary action against doctors. Attorneys 
said the reprimands will not jeopardize the doctors' standing with insurance 
carriers or their privileges at hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard Marino, however, insisted that the reprimands did 
not exonerate the doctors. He said that "because there is some concern about 
the amounts of drugs and why they were prescribed in this case, Roth and 
Skinner will have to pass oral clinical examinations in addiction medicine 
before his office will retract the accusation filed in 1990. Marino said that 
charges against Gottlieb have been withdrawn with no requirement for an exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino, who recommended that the medical board issue reprimands rather than 
press action in court this fall, said he decided this was the best course after 
listening to evidence presented by the doctors at a DEA administrative hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The DEA ordered the doctors to show cause at a hearing this spring on why 
their certificates of registration to handle controlled substances should not 
be revoked because of their "excessive" prescription of several drugs including 
Demerol, Valium, Percocet and methadone "without a legitimate medical purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 The DEA has accused Skinner of improperly administering excessive drugs to 
Taylor from April, 1987, through November, 1988. The accusations against Roth 
pertain to the period from March, 1988, through December, 1989. Roth also is 
accused of prescribing excessive drugs to two other unidentified patients from 
January, 1991, through February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the DEA, Wayne Patrick, had no comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys for the three doctors said they made a convincing argument at 
the DEA hearing that the doctors had properly prescribed medication for their 
patient, Taylor, who had an extremely high tolerance for drugs and very low 
threshold of pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a complicated case," said Bruce Kelton, the attorney for Roth. "A lot 
of experts testified. This is something that is not black and white. There's a 
debate on both sides about how pain should be controlled through medication."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; FLAGS AT BANK FALL VICTIM TO VANDALS

<P>
 Vandals who stole the California flag and left Old Glory lying on the ground 
at the Bank of America in Huntington Harbor have upset and outraged bank 
customers and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a violation of our rights as Americans," said Judy Slaughter, vice 
president and manager of the bank on Algonquin Street."Our customers are upset 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Slaughter said that someone cut the cords and pulled down the flags Monday 
night. A customer noticed the vandalism Tuesday morning before the bank opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lady was upset; she was in tears," Slaughter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police spokesman Mike Corcoran said that unless a witness to the misdemeanor 
comes forward, "there's not a lot we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Slaughter said the bank started flying the flags about three months ago and 
recently installed lighting so the flags could be left up at night. 
</P>
<P>
 A new state flag has been ordered, and the flagpole will be secured. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do what we can do to prevent vandalism, but we're just shocked that 
we have to do it," she said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CHARTER BOAT TAX WINS INITIAL OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is taking to the waves in its search for increased revenue, with 
final City Council approval pending on a charter boat tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax measure won preliminary approval Monday on a 4-3 vote. It provides 
that charters operating from Newport Harbor collect an extra 50 cents per 
passenger on fares from $26 to $50, and an extra $1 on fares of $51 or more. 
Sportfishing and whale-watching charters would be exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators from outside the harbor, who often come in for special events like 
the Christmas Boat Parade, would have to pay surcharges of $50 for cruises of 
up to 50 passengers and $100 for those of more than 50. The money would go into 
the city's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax would apply only to passengers whose tickets cost at least $26. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter boat owners don't want the tax, but after months of study and 
negotiation with city officials, most have accepted the revised ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is on board saying, 'Gee, give me another tax.' But most have agreed 
that this is the least offensive alternative," said Richard Luehrs, president 
of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin J. Murphy said Newport Beach is the only harbor city south 
of San Francisco that does not levy such a tax, which is expected to add 
$150,000 a year to city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to pay this tax," he conceded at the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials believe one-day visitors to the city often don't spend enough 
money here to support the wear and tear they generate on city facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said the 364,000 passengers on harbor charters each year should 
shoulder some of the burden for street and harbor maintenance and other city 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax would force recreational visitors to shoulder some of a tax burden 
that has traditionally rested on residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Phil Sansone, John W. Hedges and Evelyn R. Hart voted against 
the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 City revenue manager Glen Everroad pointed out in staff reports that the 
city's hotels generate $5.6 million and restaurants $2.4 million in annual tax 
revenue, while the 88 marine charter businesses kicked in only $30,000 in 
combined sales, property and business taxes last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Black, owner-operator of the Catalina Flyer, opposes the timing of the tax 
because of the tourism business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just me; it's my customers. With the way the economy has been around 
here for the last couple of years, I think putting a tax on people who are 
trying to enjoy themselves is not a good idea," Black said. "They need to let 
us get back on our feet." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my competitors from Long Beach just dropped their prices dramatically. 
Now I have to worry about my customers going up there," Black said. "People are 
shopping for price. If I have to raise my prices when my competition is 
lowering their prices, that is a factor." 
</P>
<P>
 The tax would take effect 30 days after final approval, which is expected Aug.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; DRIVERS GET A MESSAGE: DON'T DRINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As cars stopped at a police checkpoint, Paul Miller, 12, hurried over to hand 
out safety literature and emphasize the tragic consequences of drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke from experience. His friend and skateboarding companion Jeff Martinez 
was killed near the checkpoint a year ago this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for the people driving by to be aware that he was 
killed by a drunk driver," Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul was one of a dozen Westminster School District students who helped police 
staff the safety checkpoint Wednesday on Westminster Boulevard at University 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, all members of the DARE Youth Academy, prepared and handed out 
packets of safety literature and bumper stickers from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Police 
estimated that about 3,000 motorists were stopped during the duration of the 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 The information packets included messages from Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
and a guide for parents and teen-agers about drinking, using drugs and driving. 
The packets also included a bumper sticker that read, "Remember Jeff," and 
included a picture of him as well as messages discouraging people from driving 
under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul said the checkpoint was an important and positive way to remember Jeff, 
who was 13 when he was killed. "He was nice and totally funny. He was an 
appealing guy and everybody liked him," Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the checkpoint would save lives. "I'm positive, because it's 
going to make people think twice about polishing off a vodka and then driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff's parents, Ed and Gail Martinez, watched as the police and youngsters 
handed out flyers and bumper stickers bearing their son's image. They said they 
appreciated the positive work done for the community in their son's name, but 
remained angry and saddened a year after his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's changed our lives forever. There isn't a day when we wake up and don't 
think about what happened. There's not a night we go to bed and don't think 
about what happened," Ed Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Thomas Wilbur, 23, is now serving a two-year prison sentence in 
connection with Jeff's death. He was convicted of drunken driving and vehicular 
manslaughter. At the time of Jeff's death, Wilbur had previously been convicted 
of drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said he hopes the message to stop drunken driving especially reaches 
people who believe that drinking and driving "is a God-given right -- like the 
one who killed my son."JON NALICK

COUNTY SUPERVISORS CLEAR WAY FOR LANDFILL EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly two years of wrangling, Los Angeles County supervisors have 
cleared the way for an expansion of the Puente Hills landfill that will allow 
it to stay open another decade, barring a successful court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 3-2 vote, supervisors Tuesday reissued a permit to expand the nation's 
second-largest landfill into canyons within 1,750 feet of Hacienda Heights 
homes and schools. The action extends the site's operating life to 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditional-use permit allows the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles 
County, the landfill's operator, to dispose of up to 12,000 tons of waste a day 
into the canyon dump, near the junction of the San Gabriel River and Pomona 
freeways. The expansion will more than double the total amount of trash the 
facility can hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Deane Dana, whose district includes the landfill, had sought to 
limit the daily amount of trash going into the dump -- which landfill opponents 
said could have saved some canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board majority, led by Supervisor Ed Edelman, opted for the permit. 
"The need for this facility as an essential component of the county's solid 
waste management system has been repeatedly demonstrated," Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, opposed by Dana and Supervisor Gloria Molina, ends the latest 
chapter in a battle pitting the county against the Hacienda Heights Homeowners 
Improvement Assn., the Hacienda-La Puente Unified School District and R. R. & 
C. Corp. of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who live near the dump were disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the Sanitation Districts know is how to put something in the ground and 
cover it up. They don't care about these canyons," said Nancy Abbott, who has 
lived in Hacienda Heights since 1964, six years before the landfill opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a 10-year permit for the landfill but the expansion (provides) 
enough space for 20 years of trash," said Abbott, who predicted a legal appeal 
of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana said he proposed the reduction in tonnage with the intention of forcing 
the Sanitation Districts to intensify its search for alternative trash disposal 
methods, including hauling waste by rail to remote dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charles Carry, the districts' general manager, told supervisors that any 
reduction in the landfill's intake would cut the funds available to subsidize 
the proposal to transport waste out of the county by rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors last year approved a permit to expand the landfill, but Superior 
Court Judge Diane Wayne ruled it was invalid because the environmental study 
was inadequate. But in June, after an additional environmental study was 
prepared, Wayne changed her position and sent the matter back to the 
supervisors.

MAN POSING AS IMMIGRATION AGENT SOUGHT IN SERIES OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man posing as an immigration officer has gained entry into at least 10 El 
Monte apartments since January, sexually assaulting four women and a 
13-year-old girl, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Four such incidents have been reported since last week and police believe the 
man is getting more aggressive.The suspect always flashes a card that appears 
to be a state of California identification card, asks the victim if her husband 
is home and then requests to see her immigration papers, said Detective John 
Fentress. 
</P>
<P>
 Fentress said the man tells the victims he must search them for weapons and 
often fondles them. The man then orders victims to disrobe and starts going 
through drawers and walking into other rooms, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the man sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl, police said. The 
man told her that if she did not cooperate her family would be deported. 
</P>
<P>
 On some occasions the man has been scared off by a husband or someone else at 
the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the man speaks mostly English and very little Spanish when talking 
to his victims. He sometimes leaves his victims' apartments on a red 10-speed 
bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe he targets Spanish-speaking women because he does not think 
they will report him to police. The victims range in age from 13 to 26.  
</P>
<P>
 The man is described as either white or a light-skinned Latino between 25 and 
35. He is between 5 feet, 10 inches and 6 feet tall and weighs 170 to 200 
pounds. He is clean-cut and has blond to light brown hair and hazel or blue 
eyes. LISA O'NEILL

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; DEVELOPER TO SEEK PROJECT FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale's next major effort to redevelop and revitalize its downtown area 
inched forward this week with an agreement allowing a developer to begin 
acquiring property for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the long-awaited Glendale Marketplace, which is proposed for a 
two-block area bounded by Brand Boulevard, Broadway and Harvard and Louise 
streets, include a multiplex cinema, three or four major retailers and numerous 
smaller boutiques, and restaurants ranging from fast food to formal dining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Redevelopment Agency voted Tuesday to give JMB/Urban Development 
Co. 180 days to prove that it can finance the project, get the interest of 
major retail stores and obtain options to buy 60% of the land in question, 
excluding the city-owned portions of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of this project is to provide a place that combines retail, 
restaurants and entertainment, and to provide a location for promotional-type 
retail tenants that want to be in Glendale but prefer a street location rather 
than be in the Galleria," said Kirk Pelser, project manager with the 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A major music/entertainment store, a sporting goods store and a large chain 
bookstore are among the types of retailers city officials and business leaders 
hope to attract to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelser said JMB/Urban must give the Redevelopment Agency a progress report in 
90 days. If it appears the builder will not be able to get financing and is not 
generating interest from tenants, the city will have the option to walk away 
from the deal at that time.  
</P>
<P>
 But if all goes well, the second half of the 180-day period would be spent 
commencing work on an environmental impact report, designing a multilevel, 
970-space parking structure and refining construction plans for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 In a best-case scenario, city officials hope to break ground on the 
development in summer, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials admit that date could be pushed back if negotiations with the 
dozen-or-so property owners who control much of the two-block area prove 
difficult.  
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment officials have invited all affected property owners to a meeting 
at 4 p.m. Tuesday in the Planning Department hearing room, 633 E. Broadway, to 
discuss the matter. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; SCHOOL PROJECT OFFERS MORE THAN BAND-AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Jody Adams-Renteria sat down at her little school desk in Pacoima and 
began her exam, it was not a No. 2 pencil she needed to complete her task. It 
was a stethoscope. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurse was giving medical examinations Wednesday as part of a new program 
at the Vaughn Family Center, a community service center located at the Vaughn 
Street Next Century Learning Center in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is a Los Angeles Unified School District Charter School working 
with several agencies to bring health care to low-income students whose parents 
cannot normally afford insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school already has the services of a nurse, the new managed 
health delivery program has both Adams-Renteria and a medical assistant to 
provide more than just Band-Aids for knees skinned on the playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "With me here, we can do medical exams on a regular basis and catch problems 
before they develop," Adams-Renteria, a family nurse practitioner, said as she 
examined 5-year-old Carlos Martinez Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on an examination table in a former storage room for schoolbooks, 
Carlos -- the first patient to be treated under the new program -- quietly 
submitted to the nurse's pokes and prods. 
</P>
<P>
 Immunization, TB tests and physical examinations can be performed under the 
program, with more serious problems referred to other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're doing good," Adams-Renteria said in Spanish as she tried to soothe the 
nervous boy. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 30-minute examination from head to toe, Adams-Renteria turned to the 
boy's mother, Josephine Martinez, with her diagnosis. "He's basically a really 
healthy guy," she said in Spanish. Carlos, who was not born in the United 
States, was unable to receive regular health care before the Vaughn center 
opened. MediCal would only accept him on an emergency basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the family enrolled with CaliforniaKids, a nonprofit organization that 
provides free health insurance to children 2 to 18 years old from low-income 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with the Northeast Valley Health Corporation, Vaughn officials, and 
$76,000 in funding from Blue Cross of California, CaliforniaKids opened the new 
health care program at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I used to have to go to Olive View (medical center) and wait in the 
emergency room," said Josephine Martinez. "It was harder. Now I can walk to 
school and get the care." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half the population of the Pacoima-Sun Valley area surrounding the 
school lives below the poverty level, according to data released by the office 
of Statewide Health Planning and Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Center officials say they will be able to treat students five days a week at 
the new center. As many as 300 students at the school may be immediately 
eligible. If the program is successful, officials hope to expand it to other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a trend," said Michael Koch, executive director of CaliforniaKids. 
"What we would like to do is show other schools how to do it." JEFF SCHNAUFER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; COFFEEHOUSE TO BUILD WALL TO LESSEN NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of P.J. Mead's Books and Coffee will have to build a sound-buffer 
wall within 60 days to end a long-running neighborhood dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council made the decision after an emotional meeting Tuesday, when 
the cafe owners, customers and neighbors competed for support from council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Friction between neighbors in the 100 block of South Cambridge Street and the 
owners of P.J. Mead's began about 1990 when the Olde Cambridge Market and Deli 
became a coffeehouse. The market had started in the 1920s or 1930s and was 
exempt from residential zoning, according to Community Development Director 
Jack McGee. 
</P>
<P>
 Next-door neighbor Mariola Szeglowska contended that noise from the 
coffeehouse grew as the business thrived. She said she could hear music and 
conversation from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. She added that rattling of dishes and 
door-banging from late-night cleanup continued after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want a normal life," she told the council. "We don't want his 
customers to be our alarm clock." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee recommended that the Mead family build a sound-buffer wall next to the 
cafe and extend the wall about midway down the property to a garage. This would 
leave the back yard, which the Meads said is their private area, exposed. 
Neighbors contended that customers sometimes wander beyond the cafe into the 
back yard and that the wall should extend for the entire property line that 
borders Szeglowska's property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see the wall go the whole way," Councilman Fred L. Barrera said. 
"That's a small price to pay for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Mead Jr., part owner of the coffeehouse, said after the meeting that the 
Mead family was disappointed but would comply with the council's unanimous 
decision to build the wall the full length of their property line. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall will probably cost $8,000 to $10,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy that, as of right now, this has come to a conclusion," Mead 
said.LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAM FORMS AVAILABLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 4,000 Westminster School District students may be eligible for free or 
reduced-price meals under the National School Lunch and Breakfast programs, 
spokeswoman Audrey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Information and applications for the program, which begins Sept. 8, will be 
sent home with students this fall.Guidelines and application forms are also 
available at school offices and may be completed and returned any time during 
the school year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students may be eligible based on their household's size and total income. For 
example, children in a household of four would be eligible for free meals if 
the family made less than $19,240 a year. The same children would be eligible 
for reduced-price meals if the family's annual income ranged from $19,240 to 
$27,380, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 To apply, an application must be turned in with the names of all family 
members and the Social Security number of the person signing the application. 
It must also include the total household income and source of income received 
by each family member, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children from households receiving food stamps and Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children benefits are automatically eligible. Their applications must 
include the eligible children's names, the food stamp or AFDC case number and 
the name and signature of an adult house member. Foster children are also 
eligible, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 School district staff will review applications and determine eligibility. Sue 
Venaas, interim food service director, will answer questions and evaluate 
formal appeals. She can be reached at (714) 894-7311, Ext. 242, or by mail at 
district headquarters, 14121 Cedarwood Ave., Westminster, Calif. 92683. JON

 Westminster School District officials are urging parents to buy back-to-school 
clothing for their children that adheres to the district's dress code, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 District policy forbids any clothing that presents a health, safety or 
discipline problem.Prohibited items include cutoff pants and "immodest" shorts, 
as well as hats, caps, bandannas and tank tops. Other clothing not permitted 
includes shirts with obscene writing, suggestive words and inappropriate 
product advertisements, spokeswoman Audrey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also prohibits all clothing associated with gangs, such as Los 
Angeles Kings or Los Angeles Raiders attire, baggy pants with white or striped 
T-shirts and overalls worn with straps hanging off the shoulders, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if children are not affiliated with a gang, their clothes can be 
misinterpreted, and that can be dangerous. If there is any question, children 
need to change their clothes," Supt. Gail Wickstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials may send children home if they are wearing inappropriate 
attire, Brown said.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; CITY MICROFILMING PROJECT APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has voted to spend $28,000 for microfilming to save 
deteriorating city documents that show the location of sewers and other 
infrastructure. By unanimous vote Monday night, the council authorized the 
expenditure after Public Works Director Mark Christoffels made a plea for 
preserving the city's aging maps, drawings and public work documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "These original records are beginning to deteriorate at an alarming rate," 
Christoffels said in a memo to the council. "Should they be destroyed or lost, 
the city's inability to accurately address its infrastructure needs or repairs 
would be severely impacted. More importantly, should the city experience a 
large natural disaster such as a major fire, flood or earthquake, the city 
staff would not have the infrastructure records to effectively respond to 
restoring the city's streets, sewers, storm drains, etc., to operating 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed with the proposed expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important to do this," said Councilwoman Cecilia L. Age. She 
added that the city drawings and records are "an important asset" that need to 
be preserved.BILL BILLITER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; COLLEGE REOPENS POPULAR COURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mission College has added 32 classes to its fall schedule, 
reopening popular and required courses that had been filled, college officials 
said Wednesday, the first day of class registration for new students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had several students trying to get into these courses," said Carlotta 
Tronto, dean of academic affairs.Chicano studies, English as a Second Language, 
math, music and political science courses are among those that now have 
additional classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get the word out that students who are on waiting lists have 
a shot at getting into the class if they come in to register," Tronto said. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, the college has not been able to add classes to accommodate 
students on waiting lists, but this year officials had cut back on the number 
of classes for less critical or popular courses in anticipation of budget cuts. 
They cut the budget in other areas, such as utilities and equipment, so they 
could add the needed classes now, Tronto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have changed our priorities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, the enrollment for the college was at 3,431, slightly more 
than the 3,406 registered at this time last year, and college officials said 
they anticipated enrollment to be roughly the same as last year, between 6,700 
and 6,800 students. Most continuing students at the school have already 
registered by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration will continue at least a week after the first day of classes, 
which is Aug. 22. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ASSEMBLY RIVALS OK SERIES OF 6 DEBATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief rivals in the race to represent Glendale and Burbank in the state 
Assembly have tentatively agreed to debate at least six times, and to 
essentially combine their campaigns in October for a two-week stint of joint 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Republican James Rogan and Democratic challenger Adam Schiff said 
Wednesday that a series of weekly debates will probably begin next month and 
continue until the Nov. 8 election.Though details are still sketchy, the 
debates are expected to be hosted by service clubs, business groups and other 
organizations throughout the 43rd Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got together last week to discuss what kind of campaign we want to have," 
said Schiff, a former assistant U.S. attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we wanted the debates to be very freewheeling, not stilted, so we 
would be able to ask one another questions and rebut our opponent's answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, a former Glendale Municipal Court judge, won a special election in May 
to replace former Assemblyman Pat Nolan. Nolan pleaded guilty to a corruption 
charge and is now serving a prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 With the presumed advantages of incumbency on his side, Rogan said, Schiff 
stands to gain more from the debates than he does, but said he agreed to them 
for philosophical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a good-government perspective I think incumbents ought to debate, to 
give the people a chance to hear you express your views," he said. "I would not 
want to represent a district with which I am in disagreement on the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as planned, Rogan said, the two camps will combine their daily 
schedules for two weeks in October, with candidates making joint appearances at 
Republican and Democratic functions, and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates said they hope this approach will bolster public confidence in 
the political system. STEVE RYFLE

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; POLICE 
PANEL OKS CHANGES IN POLICY ON CAR CHASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Commission on Tuesday approved modifications in the 
LAPD's policy for initiating and ending car chases -- changes that are intended 
to protect innocent bystanders from death or injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to balance the need to pursue with the safety of children who 
are out playing or of other people," said Sgt. Jerry L. Powell of the 
department's training division."That's the primary focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new policy, officers will be asked to take a number of things into 
consideration before giving chase -- such the seriousness of the offense, 
traffic conditions and whether the suspect could be caught later if the pursuit 
is discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, officers will be instructed to call off a chase if there appears 
to be an "unreasonable risk of injury to the public or to the pursuing 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Police Commission President Enrique Hernandez Jr. expressed concern 
that some of the new procedures might encourage criminals to flee, police 
officials said they believe the new policy is flexible enough to allow officers 
to be able to give chase in serious cases.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; REWARD IN 
KILLING OF PASTOR, 81, INCREASES TO $50,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reward grew to $50,000 Wednesday for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of the killer of an 81-year-old minister and grandmother in her 
Mid-City Los Angeles apartment.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council offered $25,000 Tuesday in hopes of helping 
police solve the killing of Blanche Thomas, pastor of Mt.Zion Churches United 
Parish.  
</P>
<P>
 Television evangelist Gene Scott offered to double the amount Wednesday, and 
the council accepted his donation.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably seen the coverage, and because she's a lady of the cloth, he 
made the donation," said Roger Galloway, press secretary to Councilman Nate 
Holden, who proposed the initial reward. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who was active in charitable causes in her neighborhood, was found 
dead in her South La Brea Avenue apartment on July 25. She had been bound, 
gagged and sexually assaulted. Authorities have not disclosed the exact cause 
of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Some items were stolen from the home, but investigators do not believe that 
robbery was the primary motive for the attack.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MARINA DEL REY; PANEL 
NEAR AGREEMENT ON PLAYA VISTA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county Regional Planning Commission on Wednesday inched toward an 
agreement on a revised land-use plan that would clear the way for the massive 
Playa Vista project in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners spent hours going over details of the plan, including 
utility hookups, building density and public open space.The panel is expected 
to approve the package of amendments today. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the commission is only the first big hurdle in the way of Playa Vista 
developers, a consortium led by Maguire Thomas Partners. The plan also will 
have to pass muster with the county Board of Supervisors and will get a final 
review by the state Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and some Marina del Rey residents are fiercely opposed to 
the project, which will add a new yacht harbor to the marina ringed with luxury 
condos, hotels and restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
 Building the project means sacrificing precious acres of the Los Angeles 
Basin's last remaining wetlands, which straddle Ballona Creek and are 
surrounded by the marina, the Westchester cliffs and Playa del Rey.  
</P>
<P>
 Project boosters say it will bring much-needed tax dollars to the cash- 
strapped county. Some of the money the project generates also would go toward 
restoring some parts of the wetlands.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents contend that the project will be a stepping-stone for more wetland 
development and will bring additional traffic, noise and pollution.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES; 
VOLUNTARY TB TESTS TO BE GIVEN AT BELMONT HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health officials will conduct voluntary tuberculosis testing at Belmont High 
School, the largest in Los Angeles, after a student on the campus near Downtown 
was hospitalized with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with the afflicted student's classmates, their families and 
Belmont staff members, officials scheduled TB skin tests at the school on Aug. 
22 and 23.Mobile X-ray apparatus will be brought to campus for follow-up 
testing on anyone whose results are positive.  
</P>
<P>
 There are no other known TB cases on Los Angeles Unified School District 
campuses. In the last few years, from two to four cases have turned up 
annually, according to a school district health official. A county health 
official said the Department of Health Services is satisfied with the 
district's response to the Belmont case. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that adults working in schools undergo tests for the 
disease every four years; however, student testing is required only when a 
child first enters school.

FEES REMAIN IN LIMBO FOR 2 ACQUITTED IN KING CASE; FINANCES: CITY COUNCIL 
CANNOT AGREE ON WHETHER TO PAY $250,000 TO BRISENO AND WIND FOR LEGAL COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council could not agree Wednesday whether to pay the 
legal bills of the two police officers acquitted of violating Rodney G. King's 
civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In a closed-door session, six council members voted in favor of paying the 
officers a total of $250,000 to put an end to the King matter. Seven others 
feared that making the payment might somehow endorse the officers' conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue may be taken up again Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office had recommended that the city pay about $250,000 
for the legal cost of defending Theodore J. Briseno and Timothy E. Wind. Not 
settling with the officers could result in an even higher court-ordered award, 
officials warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk is there that the city could have to pay substantially more," said 
City Atty. James Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, a federal court jury acquitted Briseno and Wind for their 
roles in the March 3, 1991, arrest and beating of King. Both of them, however, 
have been fired by the Police Department for their conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other former officers, Stacey C. Koon and Laurence M. Powell, were found 
guilty of violating King's civil rights and are serving 30-month prison 
sentences. The city has refused to pay their legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The $250,000 would be a settlement with Briseno and Wind to prevent them from 
seeking higher legal fees in court. Already, the city has been forced to pay 
$3.8 million in civil penalties -- and potentially more in legal fees -- to 
King as a result of the videotaped beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a really disgraceful day for the city of L.A.," said Harland Braun, 
one of Briseno's attorneys. "Here's a guy who . . . was criminally tried twice 
and acquitted, who has now been fired by the LAPD and is now financially 
ruined." 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members said they did not want to send a message that the two 
acted appropriately.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just think that the fact they want a quarter of a million dollars of 
taxpayers' money, given their role in this matter, is unreasonable," said 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who voted to settle with the officers said they were doing so to 
save the city money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, we're going to have to pay it," said Councilman Mike 
Hernandez. "Do we pay some now or more later?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said council members Richard Alarcon, Laura Chick, Ruth Galanter, Nate 
Holden, Ridley-Thomas, Joel Wachs and Rita Walters voted against payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Hal Bernson, Marvin Braude, John Ferraro, Hernandez, Rudy 
Svorinich and Zev Yaroslavsky voted to settle. Council members Jackie Goldberg 
and Richard Alatorre were absent.

BUYER OF STORAGE UNIT'S CONTENTS FINDS REMAINS OF THREE BODIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The unclaimed contents of a Northridge storage room were sold sight unseen 
Wednesday, and the buyer was startled to learn after opening the unit that he 
had bought the decomposing remains of three long-dead bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday night, coroner's deputies found two more bodies in a room in 
which they had earlier found a single body, said Dep.Coroner Dan Aikin. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning bidder in an auction at the U-Haul rental and self-storage 
facility in the 18100 block of Parthenia Street noticed a foul odor emanating 
from the room and alerted authorities about 11 a.m., Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a trunk in the roughly 6-by-9-foot basement storage room, police found 
a body, so decayed that neither its sex nor race could immediately be 
determined, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trunk and two other large boxes found in the room were taken to the 
coroner's office, although police believe that only the trunk contained a body 
or body parts, said Detective Tom Broad of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Devonshire division. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Al Moen of the robbery-homicide division said the storage company's 
paperwork indicated that the remains had been locked away for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers would not identify the buyer. They also declined to say who had 
rented the storage room, and how long ago it had been acquired.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; ROYALS PITCHER SCORES BIG WITH SHAKEN YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even professional baseball players aren't immune to natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Jan. 17 earthquake struck, Mark Gubicza, a pitcher for the Kansas 
City Royals, felt his Northridge house shake, heard the terrifying cry of his 
2-year-old daughter, then, worst of all, had trouble getting to her because 
fallen furniture had blocked his path. 
</P>
<P>
 Though nobody was hurt, Gubicza remembers how neighbors, genuinely concerned, 
came over afterward to see how he and the family were doing. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Gubicza heard a few students from Our Savior's First Lutheran School 
in Granada Hills were having a hard time adjusting in the aftermath of the 
6.8-magnitude temblor, Gubicza could relate. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Kuhn, a parent at Our Savior's sister school in San Diego, had contacted 
various professional sports teams seeking help for the Granada Hills children 
-- something that would give them a boost and get their minds off the shaking 
ground. In addition to the havoc it inflicted on their homes, the quake left 
their school with an estimated $500,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals, with Gubicza knowing all too well just what the kids were feeling, 
were the first to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitcher and the Royals organization decided to fly six students to Kansas 
City, Mo., in late July, and give them what Peggy Ash, the school's principal, 
fondly refers to as "real royal treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The students got a tour of Kaufman Stadium, where the Royals play their home 
games, caught two games against the Chicago White Sox, lunched with Gubicza, 
met former batting champion George Brett, stayed in a five-star hotel, then 
endured a few somersaults at Worlds of Fun, an amusement park. The tab was paid 
for by the Royals organization and a fund-raising drive by the San Diego 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the same students, and a handful more, returned the hospitality to 
Gubicza during batting practice at Anaheim Stadium, when the Royals were in 
town to play the Angels. Crowding into box seats behind the backstop, they 
yelled their hellos, then held up a "Happy Birthday" banner. Gubicza turns 32 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now everybody's going to know how old I am," the pitcher joked, as he talked 
to the students from the field, the sound of ball on bat in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he went to such extremes to help the students, some of whom had to 
live out of tents after the quake, Gubicza said, "Because it hit home, being 
here myself when it happened and having a little girl who went through it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough for them, tough for everybody, and this was just a way of 
getting them away from it all, showing them Kansas City, getting their minds 
off it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn thinks the recent fun has helped the children finally put the earthquake 
behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, seventh-grader Larisa Bargman says she won't remember the fish tank 
falling on her so much as she will her new Gubicza-autographed Royals hat. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Herman Dhillon, a sixth-grader who was pinned beneath his bed for what 
may have seemed an eternity, need only turn to his Gubicza-autographed baseball 
card to forget that awful shaking in the wee hours of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to hear a shaking window and it would set them off," Kuhn said. "We 
all have fear and we all have to conquer it. And I think they're over it now."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; RESOLUTION OPPOSES AIRPORT AT EL TORO

<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday decided to go on record opposing the November 
ballot initiative that calls for building a commercial airport at the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision to oppose the airport initiative was unanimous.The 
adopted resolution faults the initiative for removing important planning issues 
from the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority and placing them in the hands of 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The reuse authority includes the five county supervisors, three Irvine City 
Council members and one Lake Forest City Council member. It is currently 
conducting studies on alternative uses for the base. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council approved placing a stop sign at Hon Avenue and 
Camberwell Street and a traffic signal at the Paseo de Valencia entrance to 
Laguna Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the new traffic signal, which will cost $100,000, the council 
also called for a review of the traffic signal priority list. Currently, the 
light at the high school ranks third in priority behind two other budgeted 
traffic signals. The other two signals are scheduled for Paseo de Valencia at 
Calle de los Caballeros and for Alicia Parkway at Via Lomas.LYNN FRANEYAIRPORTS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; DALY ANNOUNCES BID FOR REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly officially kicked off his reelection campaign Wednesday in 
front of more than two dozen supporters at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, a 40-year-old executive for the Building Industry Assn., a builders 
trade group, was first elected mayor in 1992 when he upset two-term Mayor Fred 
Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief speech on City Hall steps, Daly pointed to what he considers 
some of the city's biggest successes during his term as mayor: the 
transformation of Anaheim Plaza, the non-renewal of a city utility tax and a 
balanced city budget with a healthy reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm running for reelection to continue pushing hard for economic progress and 
renewal, for youth programs, to create more jobs, to renew and strengthen 
residential neighborhoods and to beautify our city," said Daly, a lifelong 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, I intend to streamline and improve city government so it 
can work better and cost less," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council seats are open this year but only two will be up for election in 
November because of a charter amendment passed in 1992 that changed the mayoral 
selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, one of the council members was selected by the voters to be 
mayor. But beginning this year, someone running for mayor need not be a council 
member to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
 If Daly were to lose the mayoral race, he would retain his council seat for 
two more years and that would eliminate one of the open seats. 
</P>
<P>
 If he is reelected and a third seat remains open, the City Council will have 
60 days to appoint someone to the post. If they fail to do so, then the city 
must hold a special election, according to the city clerk's office. GREG

EXPERT HIRED BY SIMPSON TEAM TO HELP PICK JURORS; TRIAL: THE PASADENA 
CONSULTANT WILL EVALUATE JURORS BY QUESTIONNAIRE AND BY WHAT THEY SAY IN COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson's defense team has hired a prominent, Pasadena-based trial 
consultant to help select the most favorable jury possible for the former 
football star, whose murder trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 After interviewing several consultants, Simpson's attorneys chose Jo-Ellan 
Dimitrius, who previously helped attorneys representing Peggy Buckey in the 
McMartin Preschool case, "Night Stalker" Richard Ramirez and the four Los 
Angeles police officers accused of beating Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimitrius, who has a Ph.D. in criminal justice and government from Claremont 
Graduate School, also has helped prosecutors in other states with jury 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are delighted to be part of the defense team," said Dimitrius, who heads a 
small firm called Trial Logistics. "We certainly have our work cut out for us." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be very difficult to find 12 people who have not already 
formed impressions and would be willing to keep an open mind," she said. "The 
amount and quality of publicity that has been brought regarding this trial has 
created a scenario unprecedented in my career as a consultant." 
</P>
<P>
 She said it would be necessary to design questions that were more 
sophisticated than in any of the other cases that she has worked on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be able to find 12 jurors. Finding out the degree to which each 
person is biased, that is truly the task for each side." 
</P>
<P>
 Dimitrius, known to her clients as "Doc" or "Dr. D," said her role is to 
"de-select" jurors who are likely to be adverse to her client. Each side can 
eliminate an unlimited number of jurors if it can state reasons why the juror 
is unfairly biased, and a limited number of jurors for no reason at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimitrius, 40, declined to go into specifics about how she would approach the 
case. But other jury consultants said it was possible that she would use focus 
groups in an attempt to get an overview of people's attitudes about Simpson and 
the case as part of designing a questionnaire. The first draft must be given to 
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said at a court hearing Tuesday that he wanted work to start on the 
questionnaire as soon as possible. Simpson has pleaded not guilty to charges of 
murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Lyle Goldman, on June 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Dimitrius has used a system that rates potential jurors on a 1 to 
5 scale, with 1 being best for her client. The score is based on a variety of 
factors that she gleans from reading answers to a questionnaire and listening 
to potential jurors' responses to questions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simpson case, attorneys are likely to be interested in potential 
jurors' attitudes toward issues such as interracial marriage, spousal abuse and 
a wealthy defendant, say jury consulting experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly would want to explore with jurors the concerns people have about 
domestic violence," said Terri Waller of another prominent jury consulting 
firm, the Oakland-based National Jury Project. "Under any circumstance I can 
think of, that has got to be something the lawyers will be concerned about. 
Even if the 911 tapes don't come into evidence . . . practically everyone who 
has heard about this case has heard something about the troubled nature of 
their relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson pleaded guilty in 1989 to misdemeanor charges of beating his then-wife 
Nicole. Shortly after Simpson was arrested in the current case, authorities 
released tapes of October, 1993, 911 calls in which Nicole Simpson pleaded for 
help as a man she identified as her former husband raged in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Waller also said the defense lawyers will want to probe whether jurors are 
resentful about "the fact that he has the money to be in a position to hire the 
most expensive lawyers and assemble some of the most sophisticated researchers 
to challenge the DNA evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 She agreed with Dimitrius that the magnitude of the publicity makes picking a 
jury more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always complicated with this much publicity," Waller said. "People think 
they know so much about the case. They've been talking about it with their 
friends. You can't get away from it. It's in our faces every day. What you have 
is a soap opera. That's why it has stayed in the public eye so long."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; LIBRARY GAME GETS CHILDREN TO READ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Stiles has learned about all kinds of flowers, bees and sharks, and now 
he is involved in heart-racing mysteries. This summer, the 10-year-old has 
spent more than 32 hours reading dozens of books as part of a reading game 
sponsored by the Fullerton Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 children are participating in the game, in which players color 
in a bubble for every half-hour they spend reading on a mock bus tour to the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 On the game board, players periodically are instructed to go to the library to 
get their bus passes punched for prizes. They also receive raffle tickets for 
chances to win weekly drawings for such items as books and gift certificates to 
local fast-food restaurants and theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something to do while I'm waiting for school to start up," Robert said 
during a recent visit to the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-year-old Megan Feighery also is playing the reading game because "reading 
gives me great pleasure. I get so into books that my imagination takes me 
everywhere. One minute I could be in California and the next I'm in Africa, 
then Australia." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was created to entice youngsters to go to the library, become 
interested in reading and improve their reading skills, said Kathy Dasney, a 
librarian in the children's section. 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps children reading during the summer in a fun way and establishes a 
lifelong relationship with books," Dasney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Polee, 13, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reading is exciting," she said. "You learn so much about everything when you 
read. . . . If you can't read, you can't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Dasney said children can still sign up to play the free game, which ends Sept.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; EMERGENCY RESPONSE TRAINING OFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters will be training community volunteers in search and rescue, 
medical aid, basic firefighting and disaster psychology in the latest step in 
the city's emergency preparedness program. 
</P>
<P>
 This effort, called Brea C.A.R.E.S. (Community Assistance and Response to 
Emergency Situations), will establish a volunteer network to help public safety 
workers when their resources are stretched to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who complete a series of five training classes that start this fall will 
be certified as emergency volunteers and issued an identifying safety vest, 
hard hat and other equipment. Advanced classes and drills will be conducted 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 The training is designed to give people "the skills they need to get through 
that initial period" following a major earthquake or other disaster, said Anna 
Cave, the city's emergency preparedness coordinator. "911 is not going to 
work," she emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
 Cave said that following the Northridge earthquake in January, most of the 
victims were saved by their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional rescue workers initially respond to the most vital locations, 
including important public buildings and facilities containing hazardous 
materials. Neighborhoods are low on the priority list. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained volunteers can help their neighbors by making door-to-door searches 
for victims, providing medical assistance and passing along important safety 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Another service neighbors can provide is checking on elderly residents. Senior 
citizens living alone are often particularly frightened during disasters, Cave 
said, "and they want people to come by and tell them it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will also be requested to communicate via amateur radio with Brea's 
new emergency operations center at City Hall. Two backup facilities are 
available if the operations center is unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 Amateur radio "is a system that never fails," Cave said. "We could lose our 
police and fire communications." But with volunteer radio operators acting as 
the city's "eyes and ears," personnel at the emergency operations center will 
be able "to draw a picture of our community" and better assess the needs in 
residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The chances that Brea will continue to avoid a large-scale disaster are not 
good, said Cave, who expects a major earthquake to strike the city within 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sit right on top of a fault," she said, referring to the Whittier-Elsinore 
fault. The city could also be severely affected by a strong temblor along the 
Newport-Inglewood fault or along the infamous San Andreas fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds are not in our favor," she said. She said the hills next to Brea 
were created by earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Temblors are not the only threats facing Brea. The city has developed highly 
detailed emergency response plans in case of wildfire, dam failure, nuclear 
accidents, flooding and incidents involving hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Cave said the planning also includes conducting evacuation drills at City Hall 
and storing emergency supplies in all municipal facilities and vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is committed to emergency management," she said. "There is no doubt 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea C.A.R.E.S. classes begin Oct. 3. To register, call the Fire Services 
Department at (714) 990-7622. ALAN EYERLY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE COLLEGE OFFERS BRICKS FOR DONATIONS 
</P>

<P>
 Pierce College thespians are urging community members to put their mortar 
where their mouths are to help pave the way to the college's Performing Arts 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1980 with state funds, the 340-seat theater and arts center sits on 
one of the highest points on campus, offering sweeping views of the Valley.But 
funds ran out more than a decade ago, before landscaping around the center 
could begin, leaving dirt covering the plaza entrance and one of its parking 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, students and administrators are asking supporters to buy a brick and help 
launch the long-delayed landscaping project. 
</P>
<P>
 For $50, supporters can assist with the improvements and have their names go 
down in history. The bricks, which will form a walkway to the center, will be 
inscribed with names of donors who take part. 
</P>
<P>
 "Former faculty and staff. People who have taken a course here," said Pierce 
President Mary Lee. "Anyone who would love to be immortalized at Pierce 
College." 
</P>
<P>
 The $350,000 project will include a plaza with a park-like setting around an 
area administrators call the focal point of the campus. The building houses 
classrooms as well as the theater, which is used for music, theater and dance 
productions. 
</P>
<P>

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; RESIDENTS SUPPORT STREETSCAPE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local residents gave a qualified nod of approval to a plan to landscape 
Ventura Boulevard -- but not before they took those responsible for the plan to 
task for what they say are eyesores around town. 
</P>
<P>
 The Encino Streetscape Committee and the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan 
Review Board held the meeting Tuesday night at the Encino Community Center to 
get public comment on a conceptual streetscape plan that features a historic 
town center at Balboa and Ventura boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The conceptual plan calls for adding trees, street lights, banners and special 
paving to the boulevard to spruce it up and attract more shoppers. The proposal 
divides the town into three zones along Ventura Boulevard, including a 
pedestrian retail zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But the purpose of the meeting seemed lost on some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, everybody used the meeting as a venting of their frustrations 
rather than for constructive criticism," said Brian Arial, a remodeling 
specialist for Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Jasper, a member of the Encino committee that organized the meeting, 
joked afterward that he should have provided Jeff Brain, a speaker, with a flak 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents complained about the city-mandated removal of landscaping at 
Gelson's Market and the city's approval of the design of Adray's, a discount 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 The pedestrian-oriented retail zone will be between Encino and Genesta 
avenues, the historic town center will be between Genesta and Rubio avenues, 
and the employment center will run between Hayvenhurst and Firmament avenues.  
</P>
<P>
 The town center is considered historic because Encino's first settlers lived 
near the area marked by the adobe in the Los Encinos State Historic Park, and 
because Chumash Indian artifacts have been unearthed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of the people in the audience raised their hands when committee 
members asked whether they had their blessing to proceed with the conceptual 
plan.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things that they identified are right on the money," said Paul 
Lewis, a landscape architect who works in Encino. Lewis said he liked the idea 
of the community being organized into three zones. He disapproved, however, of 
the trees selected by the committee -- jacarandas and Chinese elms, saying they 
shed leaves too easily.  
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about the proposal included the impact on traffic of trees planted in 
the median, the perceived overly ambitious scope of the streetscape plan, and 
its cost -- about $1 million per mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they were pleased with the better-than-expected turnout of 80 
people, which they attributed to good publicity and the concern of Encino 
residents about the appearance of their community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get to talk about streetscape as much as we would have liked," said 
Brain, chairman of the Plan Review Board, "but we made the community aware of 
what we're doing. They like what we're doing, from the show of hands." KAY

<P>
 A question for the '90s: what to do with all that brain power that had been 
previously deployed in nuclear energy fields? 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cold War over and the resulting winding-down of the nuclear arms 
race, 150 scientists with the Energy Technology Engineering Center, located in 
a canyon near Chatsworth, face unemployment.In addition, the U.S. government is 
looking at a $500-million investment in energy research going to waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking a solution, ETEC created the Community Reuse Organization, a nonprofit 
group to draw on private and public industries for joint projects. The 
organization opened its doors Wednesday in Woodland Hills with a $260,000 
matching grant from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be used for a project with Hydrogen Burner Technology, Inc. of 
Costa Mesa for a three-month study of a low-cost hydrogen fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is to bring public and private industry to ETEC to use the 
intellectual resources and lab equipment that's up there," said organization 
chairwoman Bonny Matheson. "In doing so, we maintain those jobs and equipment 
and create more jobs and high-quality products so we can compete globally." 
</P>
<P>
 ETEC will test the "under-oxidixed burner," an inexpensive machine that 
creates hydrogen gas by burning natural gas and air, according to a release. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just as safe as natural gas," said Clark Gibbs, ETEC general manager. 
"It's used in the main engines of the space shuttle." MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; NEW CSUN POLICE CHIEF IS SWORN IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Cal State Northridge campus chief of police was officially sworn in 
Wednesday during a special ceremony held in school President Blenda Wilson's 
temporary trailer facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 Edward W. Harrison, who began his duties on Aug. 2, enters his new post with 
20 years of police experience in the California State University system, 
including seven as chief at the San Bernardino campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was given the most stunning recommendation I've ever heard," said Wilson, 
referring to a conversation held with Cal State San Bernardino President 
Anthony Evans about Harrison's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chief Harrison was described as the kind of person every man wished to be -- 
articulate, wise, professional and prepared. I immediately had my staff rush 
out to make him an offer," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his active participation in community organizations outside the 
school system, including a scholarship program for underprivileged San 
Bernardino high school students, Harrison expressed the desire to establish a 
working relationship with Northridge community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be involved in a variety of issues affecting the larger community," 
Harrison said. "My main goal, however, is to provide the students and faculty 
with safe access to the education that they came to this campus for." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, 46, replaces Stan Friedman, who was appointed director of security 
at the J. Paul Getty Museum in January and Lt. Marc Hissong, who acted as the 
interim chief during the six months after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison moves into public safety facilities that, like most of the campus, 
were damaged by the quake and are undergoing renovation. Harrison's command 
includes 18 sworn officers and 111 full- and part-time support staff employees. 
 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 of those employees are privately contracted security guards, who were 
hired by the university to guard equipment in unlocked tents set up across the 
grounds. ANTONIO OLIVO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STUDENTS GIVE PITCHER A ROYAL WELCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Jan. 17 earthquake struck, Mark Gubicza, a pitcher for the Kansas 
City Royals, felt his Northridge house shake, heard the terrifying cry of his 
baby daughter, and then, worst of all, had trouble getting to her because 
fallen furniture had blocked his path. 
</P>
<P>
 Though nobody was hurt, Gubicza remembers how neighbors, genuinely concerned, 
came over afterward to see how he and his family were doing. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when he heard a few students from Our Savior's First Lutheran school in 
Granada Hills were having a hard time adjusting to the aftermath of the 
temblor, Gubicza could relate. 
</P>
<P>
 So he and the Royals organization decided to fly the six students to Kansas 
City in late July, a gesture that Peggy Ash, the school's principal, fondly 
refers to as "real 'royal' treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 There, the students were given a tour of the stadium and saw two games against 
the red-hot White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 They also lunched with Gubicza, met former batting champion George Brett, 
stayed in a five-star hotel and then endured a few somersaults at Worlds of 
Fun, an amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the same students, and a handful more, returned Gubicza's 
hospitality during batting practice at Anaheim Stadium, when the Royals were in 
town against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowding into box seats behind the backstop, they yelled their hellos, then 
held up a Happy Birthday banner for Gubicza, who turns 32 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now everybody's going to know how old I am," the pitcher joked, as he talked 
to the students from the field, the sound of ball on bat in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Gubicza said he had gone to such extremes to help the students, some of whom 
had to live out of tents after the quake, "because it hit home, being here 
myself when it happened and having a little girl who went through it too." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "It was tough for them, tough for everybody, and this was just a way 
of getting them away from it all, showing them Kansas City, getting their minds 
off it." 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Kuhn, a parent at Our Savior's sister school in San Diego, who 
orchestrated the trip by calling the Royals organization, said she thinks the 
children finally have put the earthquake behind them with all the recent fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-grader Larisa Bargman has a new Gubicza-autographed Royals hat to help 
her forget the fish tank that fell on her. 
</P>
<P>
 And Herman Dhillon, a sixth-grader, has a Gubicza-autographed baseball card to 
help him get over being pinned beneath his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to hear a shaking window, and it would set them off," Kuhn said. 
"We all have fear, and we all have to conquer it. And I think they're over it 
now."TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; 3 ARRESTED AFTER BURGLARY, CHASE 
</P>

<P>
 Two men and a juvenile who allegedly stole clothes from a downtown surf shop, 
then cut the owner with a knife, were arrested with a citizen's help after a 
wild chase through city streets and on a freeway Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Moran, 18, of Vista and Christopher Saxton of Oceanside were booked 
into Orange County Jail on suspicion of commercial burglary, felony evasion of 
arrest, felony hit-and-run driving and assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile, a 17-year-old male from San Diego, was taken to Orange County 
Juvenile Hall on similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The three reportedly walked into Rocky's Surf and Sports Shop at Avenida del 
Mar and El Camino Real about 3:30 p.m., grabbed several items of clothing and 
fled, Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owner Rocky Sabo, 39, chased them until Moran turned around and slashed 
at him, cutting Sabo's thumb, according to Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 According to investigators, Moran and the others fled in a 1985 Toyota pickup 
truck and were seen speeding on El Camino Real by a patrolling sheriff's 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pursuit, the Toyota crashed into a parked pickup truck. The owner, 
William Bowers, 22, was standing nearby and jumped into the bed of the getaway 
vehicle as it headed for Interstate 5, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Santa Margarita resident began pounding on the back window, 
eventually smashing the glass, and grabbed at the young men inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Moran pulled onto the shoulder of the freeway between Cristianitos and 
Basilone roads and ran into the underbrush, where he was caught by a deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 When driving to the side of the road, Moran jammed the passenger side of the 
truck against a guardrail. After the vehicle stopped, Bowers jumped to the 
driver's door and kept the other two suspects from fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers was uninjured; Sabo's injury was treated at the scene by paramedics.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; PANEL REJECTS NEED FOR NEW GATE SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After three hours of sometimes heated public comment, the city's Planning 
Commission concluded this week that a second survey of El Niguel Heights 
residents on the issue of gating their community will not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 A March survey showed 76% of El Niguel residents wanted to take control of 
their streets from the city and build gates at the neighborhood's two entrances 
on Club House Drive and Niguel Road.By city ordinance, 75% of a neighborhood's 
residents must give the OK before public streets are turned over to a 
homeowners association and gates are installed. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents said the results were tainted by late and faxed ballots, 
and that, before the voting period ended, city officials had given a list of 
names of residents who had not voted yet to advocates of gates. They asked that 
a second survey be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Commissioner Eli Naffah, the commission rejected that 
argument, saying the survey was not an official election and thus was not 
governed by election procedure rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very confident that 75% within the community want the gates," 
Commissioner Marc Winer said. "To make them go through hoops again would not be 
fair." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 residents packed the hearing room Tuesday and spilled over to 
outside picnic tables, where they listened to the proceedings over two 
loudspeakers. Many El Niguel Heights residents urged the commission to approve 
the gates, saying they want to make their community safe from burglars, vandals 
and speeders. 
</P>
<P>
 Gate opponents from within and outside El Niguel Heights told the council that 
privatization might jeopardize residents' access to Seminole Park, a public 
park located within the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Some El Niguel Heights homeowners also raised concerns that the city would 
possibly hand over streets that need substantial repairs.LYNN FRANEY

COUNCIL APPROVES HOSPITAL OVERPASS FOR PEDESTRIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved construction of a pedestrian walkway over La 
Veta Avenue that will link on-street parking with the main complex at St. 
Joseph Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital hopes to begin construction of the overpass in late August and 
complete the structure in about five months.The work will be done at night and 
disruption to traffic should be minimal, said Dennis Sisto, vice president for 
support services at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkway over the 90-foot-wide street will allow visitors to enter the 
hospital without negotiating traffic on La Veta. 
</P>
<P>
 In their vote Tuesday, council members also approved a provision prohibiting 
banners from being displayed on the overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and the hospital had discussed banners reading "Welcome to St. 
Joseph" or "Welcome to Orange," but the council rejected those ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The overpass will stand 17 feet above La Veta Avenue at Pepper Street, 
according to the designs. The walkway will be enclosed with a roof and screened 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the hospital will be able to take an elevator or stairs to the 
walkway from the intersection of Pepper and La Veta, reaching the hospital's 
main complex without having to cross traffic on La Veta. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had made the overpass a condition of building the outpatient pavilion 
about two years ago, Sisto said. LESLEY WRIGHT

BODIES FOUND AMONG ITEMS AUCTIONED AT STORAGE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The unclaimed contents of a storage room in Northridge were sold sight unseen 
at auction Wednesday, and the buyer was startled to learn after opening it that 
he had bought the decomposing remains of a long-dead body. 
</P>
<P>
 Later on Wednesday, coroner's officials said two more bodies had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers said the winning bidder in the auction at the U-Haul rental and 
self-storage facility in the 18100 block of Parthenia Street noticed a foul 
odor emanating from the room and alerted authorities about 11 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside a trunk in the roughly 6- by-9-foot basement storage room, police found 
a body, so decayed that neither its sex nor race could be immediately 
determined, officers said. The coroner's office determined Wednesday night that 
the body was that of a man, said Coroner's Investigator Dan Aikin. 
</P>
<P>
 The two bodies discovered about 11 p.m. Wednesday night were in other trunks 
in the storage room. The sex of those bodies was not determined. "They were 
also decomposing," Aikin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trunks in which they were found had earlier been taken to the coroner's 
office to be opened in the presence of medical examiners, said Detective Tom 
Broad of the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Al Moen of the LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division said the storage company's 
paperwork indicated that the remains had been locked away for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers would not identify the buyer. They also declined to say who had 
rented the storage room, and how long ago the renter had acquired it. 
</P>
<P>
 The trunk containing the first body had been wrapped in plastic and taped 
shut, said Bob Collis of the Los Angeles City Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and coroner's investigators scoured the storage site for clues, turning 
aside most questions from the flock of reporters gathered outside the 
facility's gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although at first police were unsure whether the trunk contained human or 
animal body parts, further inspection revealed the contents to be a decayed 
human body, Moen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad said police were continuing to investigate the information provided by 
the storage room's original rental papers. Those documents, he said, had to be 
brought in from another location, further hampering immediate efforts to locate 
the renter. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we can say is that it appears we have a partially decomposed human body," 
Moen said. "There is (paperwork) for that room, so obviously, we're going to be 
looking at that" for clues, he said.

CBS AGREES TO SOFTEN IMPACT OF CENTER'S EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS has agreed to take 15 steps to soften the impact of traffic, noise and 
parking caused by a major expansion of its Studio Center facility, at the 
request of the Studio City Residents Assn., according to association President 
Tony Lucente. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the measures is an agreement by the television network to build an 
internal bridge in its project area -- which would reduce traffic on nearby 
residential streets -- before it proceeds with the second stage of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 8, a city zoning administrator indicated that he would grant CBS a 
conditional use permit to build the commercial development on residentially 
zoned land, and to exceed height limits on Radford Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The network wants to build seven new sound stages on 11.5 acres across the Los 
Angeles River from its 30-acre property at Radford Avenue and Ventura 
Boulevard. The $30-million, 245,000-square-foot project includes dressing 
rooms, storage areas, production support areas and 1,202 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucente said that his association submitted a list of requested traffic-, 
noise- and parking-mitigation measures to CBS after the zoning hearing, and 
that the network agreed to virtually all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the measures agreed to by CBS: 
</P>
<P>
 * The network will build a major parking structure before, rather than during, 
the third construction phase, which will make it less likely that employees and 
studio tenants will park on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 6-foot-high berm landscaped with 15- to 21-foot-tall trees will be erected 
on the development's eastern border to screen the development from residents 
across the Tujunga Wash. A landscaped berm with a minimum height of 3 feet will 
be built on the project's western border.  
</P>
<P>
 * The city will review the project after each phase before giving CBS the 
go-ahead to proceed to the next phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Schuman, who represented CBS in its meetings with residents and City 
Councilman Joel Wachs' office, said some of the items were things that CBS had 
intended to do from the start.  
</P>
<P>
 "We all feel very good that today businesses and homeowners are able to sit 
down at a table and talk and, with the help of the City Council office, work 
these things out," Schuman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've always been very open to our comments and feedback," Lucente said. 
"It's just unfortunate that we couldn't do this earlier, but it is a very large 
and complex project. They've been very positive to work with."

STRIKE DELAYS RELEASE OF TRANSIT COST ESTIMATES; RAIL: STUDIES FOR SUBWAY AND 
AN ELEVATED GUIDEWAY ARE LATE BECAUSE PLANNERS AND PROGRAMMERS WERE ASSIGNED TO 
OTHER DUTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eagerly awaited cost estimates of the two rail options across the San Fernando 
Valley, due to be released this month, will be delayed until September because 
of the recent transit strike, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority had hoped to complete the cost 
analyses for the two alignments -- subway versus elevated guideway -- in 
August, paving the way for its board of directors to choose a route for the 
long-delayed project. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recent nine-day labor walkout took its toll on planners and 
researchers, many of whom drove buses or were pressed into service in other 
departments to help the agency maintain its crippled bus operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strike really did impact us," said Judith Wilson, head of the MTA's 
planning and programming unit, which is compiling the cost comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and politicians have long awaited the studies as probably the 
determining factors in the debate on whether to run the line over the Ventura 
Freeway, like a monorail system, or bury it below ground, between Burbank and 
Chandler boulevards, as an extension of the Metro Rail subway system. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the elevated railway, including Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich, have pointed to cost as the preemptive advantage of such a 
system, especially now that the MTA is struggling to close a $300-million 
budget deficit. Past projections put the cost of an overland route at $2.6 
billion, less than the $3 billion required for a subway. 
</P>
<P>
 But last spring, planners told the MTA board that the price of both projects 
could be brought down through more efficient construction techniques, the 
postponement of some station openings and alternate station designs, such as 
open-air stations for the subway. Advocates of the subway hope costs will drop 
enough to make a Red Line extension financially competitive with an elevated 
railway. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate over which route to choose will probably be fierce, pitting Antonovich 
against fellow Supervisor Ed Edelman, who will serve as the MTA chairman until 
his retirement in December, one of the county's most politically powerful 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Planners want the matter decided by the end of the year to allow work to go 
forward on the necessary environmental studies, which must be completed in time 
for the agency to apply for money from a special fund in the 1997 federal 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost analyses were delayed by the transit strike as employees in planning 
and programming were assigned to driving buses and other duties. MTA 
spokeswoman Andrea Greene said 55% of the unit's staff -- the highest 
proportion of any department -- were switched to strike-related tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "(It) took the brunt of the call for strike duty," Greene said.

ALZHEIMER'S ASSN. SEEKS TO EXPAND ITS VOLUNTEER BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a heightened demand for services, the Alzheimer's Assn. of 
Orange County is attempting to double its volunteer base, according to Kim 
Robinson, the nonprofit agency's program director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very small staff, so we are totally reliant on our wonderful corps 
of volunteers," Robinson said. "We have about 300 volunteers, which sounds like 
a lot, but we could easily use twice as many." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 40,000 Alzheimer's patients live in Orange County, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most pressing needs is for workers to operate a phone information 
service at the agency's headquarters. This free service provides information 
about the disease and resources available to patients and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, teams of volunteers are needed to make home visits that help 
"reduce the isolation" often experienced by Alzheimer's patients and their 
care-givers, Robinson said. Volunteers are also needed to conduct support 
groups for care-givers throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern medical technology is allowing people to live longer, Robinson said, 
but this also increases the risk of becoming afflicted with an age-related 
disease such as Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
 Alzheimer's is the fourth-leading cause of death among older adults, Robinson 
said. The ailment strikes 10% of people 65 and older and 47% older than 85. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more quantity of life but not always a quality of life," Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Alzheimer's is primarily associated with senior citizens, "we're also 
seeing young patients," Robinson said. "I've heard of patients in their 30s, 
and some of those patients have young children." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what causes Alzheimer's, so we don't have a cure for it," she 
said. "But we have discovered ways to manage it better." 
</P>
<P>
 In the final stage of the disease, "the person is totally helpless," Robinson 
said, which can place an extreme burden on family members and other 
care-givers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is very little government support," she said. "It is devastating not 
only emotionally but financially." 
</P>
<P>
 The next training session for new volunteers is scheduled for 1 to 3 p.m. Aug. 
26 at the agency's headquarters, 2540 N. Santiago Blvd., in Orange.

GIRL ESCAPES FIRE THAT GUTS MUCH OF HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A single-family home sustained an estimated $150,000 in damage Wednesday when 
fire gutted much of the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Garden Grove Fire Department said a girl was inside the 
Aspenwood Lane home when the fire broke out about 12:15 p.m. but escaped 
without injury. The girl was not identified, but the spokeswoman, Ellen Covey, 
said she was a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's pet dog was killed in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters said the blaze appears to have begun in the kitchen, where food 
was found on the stove. 
</P>
<P>
 Flames spread through the first floor and up to the roof, Covey said. It took 
27 firefighters about 15 minutes to contain the blaze.

MAN MISSING FOR TWO WEEKS FOUND UNHARMED IN L.A.; SEARCH: THE 32-YEAR-OLD 
PRIVATE SECURITY GUARD WAS NOT KIDNAPED BUT BECAME 'LOST' BECAUSE OF A MENTAL 
DISABILITY, AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A private security guard who had been missing for two weeks was found just 
after midnight Wednesday in South Central Los Angeles, unharmed but slightly 
bewildered by the experience, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officers and private investigators hired to search for Michael 
Jerome Williams, 32, concluded that he was not abducted or held against his 
will but had become "lost" since July 26 because of a mental disability, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family was very relieved," said Nelda Gonzalez, an investigator with 
Roberts Protection and Investigations. "They were very concerned, and quite 
frankly, I think they were expecting the worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams disappeared after leaving his Santa Ana home for Newport Beach to 
pick up his paycheck and new security guard uniform. The mystery surrounding 
his disappearance intensified late last week when Anaheim police stopped three 
teen-agers who were in a rental car that Williams had been lent while his own 
car was being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The private investigators were hired during the weekend, and on Monday, 
Williams' father, the Rev. Frank Williams, assistant pastor at Friendship 
Baptist Church in Long Beach, set up a trust fund to help in the search for his 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said that in the 48 hours that followed news reports about Williams' 
disappearance, investigators received more than 150 telephone calls, and one of 
those contacts helped lead them to the missing security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael was told by people in Los Angeles that he was being sought after by 
his family and was reported missing," Gonzalez said. "He thought he had better 
get in contact." 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the family, the private investigations firm released only 
sketchy details of Williams' disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said Williams was left stranded in Los Angeles after giving a woman a 
ride to the area. She eventually turned the car over to the juveniles who were 
detained last week by Anaheim police. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams befriended a man who offered to share his trailer home and also lent 
him some clothes, Gonzalez said. Williams later contacted a friend who then 
notified the missing man's family. They were reunited early Wednesday morning.

GANG MEMBER, 39, KILLED IN ATTACK AT PARENTS' HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 39-year-old Santa Ana man was shot and killed Wednesday afternoon while 
repairing a bicycle in the front yard of his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Dick Faust said the shooting was gang-related and described the 
victim, Robert Corral Gonzalez, as "a known Santa Ana gang member." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez was confronted by the gunman about 1:10 p.m. at the home in the 1700 
block of Lingan Lane, Faust said. Witnesses told police the gunman shot 
Gonzalez in the chest with a weapon that police later determined was a 
9-millimeter handgun, Faust said. Gonzalez ran about 10 feet before collapsing. 
</P>

 The gunman then stood over Gonzalez and shot him several times in the back 
before fleeing, Faust said. The assailant is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Faust said investigators are trying to determine the motive for the attack.

LA HABRA ADDS TO LIMITS WHERE ADULT BUSINESSES MAY OPERATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission this week unanimously adopted an ordinance that 
prohibits sexually oriented businesses from opening within 250 feet of a 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, such establishments must be at least 275 feet from any home and 
150 feet from other similar businesses, which include adult book and video 
stores, topless bars and X-rated theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members will consider adopting the same ordinance within weeks 
before a 300-day moratorium on issuing permits to adult businesses expires, 
city officials said. The moratorium imposed in January extended a 45-day ban 
that was adopted in November after the council heard a rumor that someone 
planned to seek permission to open a nude bar here. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners said uncontrolled adult businesses inflict detrimental social 
and economic strains on residents and other businesses around them. In a report 
to the Planning Commission, they said crime rates are higher in areas where 
such businesses operate. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also said the image of the city "as a pleasant and attractive place 
to reside will be adversely affected by the presence of adult businesses in 
close proximity to" neighborhoods, churches, schools and parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Churchgoers and pastors agreed and applauded the Planning Commission's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not need adult businesses in this city," the Rev. Rex Spraggins said. 
"Any type of adult business literally destroys families. . . . I'm not a prude, 
but we do not need it in this city." 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses and property owners who rent business space sent letters to 
city officials opposing the ordinance because it might discourage people from 
opening adult businesses in their complexes.MIMI KO

MAN SUSPECTED IN 2 FAST-FOOD STICKUPS IS JAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who reportedly robbed two South County fast-food establishments at 
gunpoint Tuesday has been arrested by sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Matthews, 34, of Tustin was booked at Orange County Jail on suspicion 
of armed robbery after being stopped in his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Dan Martini said Matthews appeared at 
the drive-up window of the two establishments, ordered food and, when asked to 
pay, displayed a revolver and demanded money. 
</P>
<P>
 The first robbery occurred shortly before 11 a.m. Tuesday at Burger King 
Restaurant, 23641 Rockfield Blvd., in Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said Matthews went through the drive-through lane directly to the 
order window and ordered a hamburger. He then allegedly produced a blue-steel 
handgun and forced the cashier to turn over $87. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews drove away in a dark blue pickup truck with the license plate covered 
by a paper bag, according to Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9:17 p.m. the same day, deputies received a report that a man matching the 
description of the suspect in the earlier robbery had taken $200 from a Wendy's 
restaurant at 24671 Alicia Parkway in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, officers spotted a blue Mitsubishi pickup truck at Irvine 
Center Drive and Jeffrey Road in Irvine and stopped it. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews surrendered without a struggle, and Martini said he has been 
identified as a suspect in both robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 All money taken in the thefts was found in Matthews' truck, Martini said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MILITARY MUSCLE; NEW GENERATION CARGO JET 
DROPS OFF A 20-TON TANK IN ONGOING TEST AT EDWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 1,300 feet above the desert here, a high-tech military cargo jet opened 
its belly and hurled a 20-ton U.S. Army tank into the wild blue yonder. 
</P>
<P>
 If this were a summer blockbuster movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger might be 
clinging to the outside of this airborne tank. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was no movie stunt. And there was no crash in store for this armored 
vehicle, an unmanned Sheridan tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after it rolled out of the C-17 cargo jet Wednesday, eight huge, green 
parachutes inflated. The tank, strapped to an aluminum platform, rocked 
precariously beneath the chutes, then leveled off and landed gently on the dry 
bed of Rogers Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force officials had invited newspaper and television reporters to this 
aerial drama, part of the ongoing testing associated with the costly new C-17 
jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Terry E. Tomeny, director of the C-17 test program, said he was pleased 
with the outcome -- and the overall performance of the plane. Highly 
maneuverable and designed for quick takeoffs and landings, the computer-guided 
C-17 is expected to take the place of older, less flexible military cargo 
planes in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most versatile airlifter in the world today," Tomeny said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tank drop was one demonstration of the craft's capabilities, he said. In a 
real-life battle zone, a C-17 could drop tanks, personnel vehicles and other 
heavy materiel. Troops could quickly unstrap them and put them into action. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, each plane can carry up to 102 soldiers, as well as military and 
medical relief supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomeny said crews at Edwards began testing the jets in September, 1991, and 
should complete the evaluation by the end of this year. The Air Force has 
released the first eight C-17s for limited use by pilots at Charleston Air 
Force Base in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy equipment drops by the C-17, such as the tank test, are still being 
reviewed at Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 The cargo jets, manufactured in Long Beach by McDonnell Douglas, carry a price 
tag in excess of $300 million each, which has drawn criticism from some members 
of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Ramsey, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman, said Congress has approved funding 
for 26 C-17s, and Pentagon officials are seeking approval for at least 14 more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the first 40 jets, McDonnell Douglas hopes to reduce the price to about 
$225 million, Ramsay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some congressional critics have questioned whether the C-17 will live up to 
all of the claims made by its Air Force boosters. During Wednesday's 
demonstration at Edwards, Air Force officials praised the C-17's performance 
and said nothing about its cost.

INJURY FRIGHTENS RUBLEY; RAMS: CONSTANT PAIN IN HIS ARM THROWS BACKUP 
QUARTERBACK OFF COURSE AS HE TRIES TO MAKE THE TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pain is a constant reminder to quarterback T.J. Rubley that he no longer 
controls his future with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams said he had a sore arm, but their announcement some 10 days ago 
omitted the agonizing details. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley's throwing arm has been throbbing since March, and when he extends it, 
his elbow makes a stomach-turning pop. The nerves leading from elbow to hand 
make opening a door or shaking someone's hand a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 His right hand remains blotchy red and bloated -- so swollen that he has 
trouble holding a football. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tips of my fingers feel like they are scarred," Rubley said. "It's like a 
pitcher trying to throw a curveball and he can't feel the seams." 
</P>
<P>
 Team physicians have talked about surgery, but for the present time have 
advised rest and medication to reduce inflammation. There has been little 
improvement the last 10 days, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I can do," Rubley said. "I'm very scared. I'm not scared of 
too many things, but the thought of being wheeled down that hall and undergoing 
surgery is tough for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good thing about this injury is that there isn't anything mechanically 
wrong with me, but I'm scared that every time someone has elbow surgery there 
is this cloud that follows. People get their knees done all the time and 
they're fine, but an elbow for a thrower is something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such fear, Rubley asked team doctors last week to operate on his arm 
so he could return to work. They suggested more rest, however, and so he waits. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind I think something is going to have to be corrected in my arm," 
Rubley said. "They've talked about shaving this bone in my elbow to take the 
pressure off a nerve, and if they do that they said it would be eight weeks 
before I could begin throwing competitively again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inflammation is down some, but the progress just isn't there, and it 
still hurts. . . . I'm just trying to hold the ball without dropping it. . . . 
They ask me every day how it feels, and I want to lie and tell them it's fine, 
but they're going to see it as soon as I throw." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley kept his sore arm a secret for months, and as a result, almost played 
himself off the team. His performance in mini-camp was dreadful, and prompted 
Coach Chuck Knox to summon him to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I wasn't throwing well to my left or throwing the ball as well as I 
was capable," Rubley said. "I agreed." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley, who is known for spending more off-season workout time at Rams Park 
than any other player on the roster, did not tell Knox about his sore arm. 
Instead, he worked harder and his arm suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was just something wrong with him, and yet he never said anything," 
said Mike Martz, Ram quarterbacks coach. "T.J. is a guy who is going to try and 
suck it up. If his arm hurts, he's going to think, 'I just need to throw more 
balls.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to jump on throws with his body where he hadn't done that 
before. I couldn't figure out why, and so I thought he was pressing because of 
the competition for a job. Now it's understandable why he was playing the way 
he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Without knowing about Rubley's sore arm at the time, the team began to focus 
its attention on Jamie Martin as a potential replacement on the final roster. 
Rubley wasn't throwing the ball well and Martin was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it was just like brushing money off the table," Rubley said, "but I 
figured my arm was hurting because I had widened my stance during the 
off-season. Then I began pressing because I was trying to get my body to throw 
the ball the way I had thrown it in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I wasn't getting the job done, but my arm felt very tired and very 
old. There's a difference between being injured and hurt, and I didn't want to 
cry wolf. I didn't think I was injured; I just needed to work my way through 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 He made it through the first week of training camp with gritted teeth, but 
this wasn't the same T.J. Rubley who had played so well at season's end as the 
Rams' starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was making all kinds of adjustments," he said. "I was twisting my 
shoulders, and then I was throwing the ball like a screwball to avoid the pain. 
There were times when my hand wouldn't sweat, and that really kind of scared 
me. The ball felt like an ice cube." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley's hand has begun to sweat again, but it remains puffy. His wrist is 
still tender, his arm sore and this year's audition for steady employment with 
the Rams will soon be over. 
</P>
<P>
 "To stand there and be just a ballboy is awfully tough," Rubley said. "I love 
the game, and this is something I just love to do, but I can't do it now."

WINNING UGLY, THE U.S. WAY; BASKETBALL: COACH ADMITS HE CAN'T CONTROL 
TRASH-TALKING AMERICAN TEAM AFTER IT TROUNCES PUERTO RICO, 134-83. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, U.S. players, can you spell "international incident?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another overpowering American effort was overshadowed by American showboating. 
The United States blew out Puerto Rico, 134-83, at the World Championships on 
Wednesday night but failed to answer the question: Why can't they roll it up 
without rubbing it in? 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, American players talked trash, cavorted theatrically and generally 
demeaned a comically overmatched opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again U.S. Coach Don Nelson said he didn't like it . . . but added he was 
powerless to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me put it this way," Puerto Rico Coach Carlos Morales said, "they are 
great basketball players but they are not greater people than we are. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult to accept that some players that you always look up to get 
on a court with some people that are not NBA players and they want to do the 
same thing that they do when they are playing for a championship in the NBA -- 
pushing, shoving, showing people up. That doesn't belong here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Dream Team I was composed of legends and those legends handled 
themselves better on the court and outside the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, who first claimed he had heard and seen nothing in the Australia rout, 
promised to tell his players to knock it off if he found out it was true. 
</P>
<P>
 A night later, Nelson acknowledged he couldn't control his players, a 
redundant announcement for anyone who saw Wednesday's second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it," Nelson said. "I didn't do it as a player. I'm between a 
rock and a hard place. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are grown men, responsible for their own actions. Some guys do it. I 
can't control it. We didn't start it, I don't think. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only request. I can't demand at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half, this was only a basketball game, the Americans' most 
impressive of the World Cup. Leading 15-13, they went on a fearsome 37-6 run, 
led by Reggie Miller, who made eight three-pointers and scored 26 points by 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes into the second half, the U.S. led, 83-39, and a USA Basketball 
official said: "Here comes the ugliest 15 minutes you've ever seen, with the 
gentlemen we have on our team." 
</P>
<P>
 At that very moment, Alonzo Mourning tangled with Puerto Rico's Jerome Mincy, 
a low-power beef that should have been forgotten in a minute but which the 
American players took as an act of war. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 13 minutes, Shaquille O'Neal, the mightiest young player of his 
generation, threw down eight dunks, most of them against a Puerto Rican scrub 
named Felix Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 A double-teaming Puerto Rico guard, Orlando Vega, tried to block one of 
O'Neal's shots. The two went chest to chest. Vega subsequently took Dan Majerle 
and Larry Johnson one-on-one in a hotdogging duel. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little trash talking," said Vega, a New York native, laughing. "I like 
that. They like that also."  
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's grown men who are responsible for their actions said they had only 
replied in kind, the Puerto Ricans had started it, proving only that they don't 
get it. No one looks to Puerto Rican basketball for models. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's game ended like Tuesday's 56-point rout of Australia, with the 
American reserves celebrating every basket wildly, jumping to their feet, 
dancing and waving.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you didn't misinterpret what Dream Team I was doing, then don't 
misinterpret what we're doing," Larry Johnson said. "We're out trying to win 
the gold and anybody who says otherwise is misinterpreting." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, of course, staged the most embarrassing single incident, a loud, 
obscene reference to an Australian player that required no interpreting. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the American team got through another night with no fights 
or arrests, so the United States should count its blessings. 
</P>
<P>
 World Basketball Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Dino Radja scored 25 points and Toni Kukoc had 15 points and 12 assists as 
Croatia remained unbeaten with a 92-61 victory over Canada. To advance to the 
semifinals, Canada (0-2) would have to defeat China and have Greece lose to 
China and Croatia. Even then, it would come down to a point-differential 
tiebreaker.

NO PROGRESS MADE IN KEY STRIKE ISSUES; BASEBALL: RHETORIC IS FAMILIAR AND 
DISCUSSIONS ON THE SALARY CAP PRODUCE NO MOVEMENT. NO MEETINGS SET FOR TODAY.

 Pitcher Mike Mussina of the Baltimore Orioles, one of the brightest lights in 
one of baseball's brightest seasons, emerged Wednesday from what may have been 
the final attempt to avert a players' strike Friday and said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 95% certain there will be no games on Friday, and I'm sure it will last 
as long as there are no owners at these meetings. We're not talking to owners. 
We're talking to an owners' representative who as far as I know will be the 
only one making money if there's a strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Richard Ravitch, the representative being paid $750,000 a year on a 
contract that expires in December, and Don Fehr, executive director of the 
players' union, left the 2 1/2-hour negotiating session and indicated that 
Mussina's 95% may be low. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see nothing of significance happening later today or anytime soon," Fehr 
said. "There's no sense in having a meeting just to have a meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's renewed discussions on the critical issue of a salary cap produced 
no progress or hint of a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 No meeting is scheduled today, which could be the last day of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a new collective bargaining agreement, a strike by the players is 
virtually certain to start Friday, possibly erasing the final 52 days of the 
regular season, along with the playoffs and the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Oriole pitcher Jim Poole, one of 11 players to attend Wednesday's meeting 
at a Manhattan hotel: "We're 48 hours away from shutting down the game, and 
Ravitch is giving us the same speech he gave us in March 1993. I'm not going to 
lie to you, it's depressing." 
</P>
<P>
 The rhetoric was familiar after the meeting, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch spoke about the clubs' need for a new compensation system that would 
produce cost certainty and slow the growth of salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he regretted the union's ongoing failure to respond to the owners' 
salary-cap proposal, stressed the unanimity among owners, expressed doubt that 
he and Fehr would be able to resolve differences before Friday -- "maybe 
lightning will strike one of us with an idea" -- and said it is the fans who 
are hurt more by a strike than owners or players. 
</P>
<P>
 "A strike is not the end of the process but a midpoint," he added. "We still 
have to sit down at some point and negotiate. We still have to sit down at some 
point and compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said the players will not accept a salary cap and that this is simply the 
final stages of a plan the owners put in place several months ago, forcing the 
players to wait 18 months for a proposal they knew the players wouldn't accept 
and ultimately forcing the strike that the owners wanted in hopes of breaking 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have shut down the game at the end of last season, but we gave up 
that leverage, thinking that another year would give us the needed time to 
negotiate," Fehr said. "We acted in good faith and have been played for suckers 
by the owners. It's a terrible shame that it's come to this, but it's not a 
fight of our making." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said the real fight is between the big- and small-market clubs over how 
to distribute $1.8 billion in revenue, a fight they couldn't resolve without 
linking their increased revenue sharing to a salary cap that forces the players 
to pay back any generosity by the big-market clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the owners' actions during the stalemated negotiations, their recent 
withholding of a $7.8-million pension payment, Ravitch's refusal to let owners 
attend the bargaining meetings, the absence of a commissioner, the 
restructuring report that "amounted to nothing" and the ongoing vacancies in 
the executive offices of the licensing department as examples of a monopoly in 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed that the owners have acted so irresponsibly, but that's what a 
cartel does," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the union offered the owners a series of proposals based on the 
research and recommendation of independent accounting firms, but these 
proposals were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't responsive to the industry's problems," Ravitch said. "They 
didn't transfer enough money to solve those problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The strike figures to be costly to owners, players and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas Rangers said they would reduce salaries of all 150 full-time 
employees by 10% if a strike lasts until Sept. 1 and by 15% after that. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners anticipate some of their biggest attendance dates during the 
September pennant stretch drive and have $140 million in TV revenue at stake 
during the postseason. They have no insurance, but still have a $260-million 
line of credit opened in 1992, from which some clubs have already borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The players have a $175-million-plus strike fund built from licensing revenue 
and will distribute checks on Sept. 15 and Sept. 29, normal paydays for the 
players. They estimate a loss of $5 million a day in salaries, but their 
biggest risk is the possibility that the owners will eventually declare an 
impasse and unilaterally implement their proposed new system. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he wasn't sure how the union would respond. None of the previous 
seven work stoppages since 1972 have gone that far. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRIKE IS CERTAIN: No more talks are scheduled, eliminating any chance for a 
settlement before Friday. A1

RUBLEY IS THROWN FOR A LOSS BY INJURY; FOOTBALL: RAM QUARTERBACK'S THROWING ARM 
IS IN CONSTANT PAIN, HIS HAND IS BADLY SWOLLEN AND HE IS WORRIED ABOUT HIS 
FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The pain is a constant reminder to quarterback T.J. Rubley that he no longer 
controls his future with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams said he had a sore arm, but their announcement about 10 days ago 
omitted the agonizing details. Rubley's throwing arm has been throbbing since 
March, and when he fully extends it, the elbow makes a stomach-turning pop. The 
nerves leading from elbow to hand make simple tasks such as opening a door or 
shaking hands a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 His right hand is covered with red blotches and so swollen that he has trouble 
holding a football. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tips of my fingers feel like they are scarred," Rubley said. "It's like a 
pitcher trying to throw a curveball and he can't feel the seams." 
</P>
<P>
 Team doctors have discussed surgery, but for the time being have advised rest 
and medication to reduce inflammation. There has been little improvement in the 
past 10 days, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I can do," Rubley said. "I'm very scared. I'm not scared of 
too many things, but the thought of being wheeled down that hall and undergoing 
surgery is tough for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his fear, an impatient Rubley asked the doctors last week to operate 
on his arm so that he could return to work. They suggested more rest, however, 
and so he waits. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, I think something is going to have to be corrected in my arm," 
Rubley said. "They've talked about shaving this bone in my elbow to take the 
pressure off a nerve, and if they do that they said it would be eight weeks 
before I could begin throwing competitively again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inflammation is down some, but the progress just isn't there, and it 
still hurts. . . . I'm just trying to hold the ball without dropping it. . . . 
They ask me every day how it feels, and I want to lie and tell them it's fine, 
but they're going to see it as soon as I throw." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley kept his sore arm a secret for months, and as a result almost played 
himself off the team. His performance in minicamp was dreadful, prompting Coach 
Chuck Knox to summon him to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I wasn't throwing well to my left or throwing the ball as well as I 
was capable of," Rubley said. "I agreed." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley, who is known for spending more off-season workout time at Rams Park 
than any other player on the roster, did not tell Knox about his sore arm. 
Instead, he worked harder and his arm suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was just something wrong with him, and yet he never said anything," 
said Mike Martz, Ram quarterback coach. "T.J. is a guy who is going to try and 
suck it up. If his arm hurts, he's going to think, 'I just need to throw more 
balls.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to jump on throws with his body where he hadn't done that 
before. I couldn't figure out why, and so I thought he was pressing because of 
the competition for a job. Now it's understandable why he was playing the way 
he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley, who is battling with Jamie Martin for the No. 3 spot behind Chris 
Miller and Chris Chandler, made it through the first week of training camp, 
gritting his teeth, but this wasn't the same T.J. Rubley who had played so well 
as the Rams' starting quarterback at the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was making all kinds of adjustments," he said. "I was twisting my shoulders 
and then I was throwing the ball like a screwball to avoid the pain. There were 
times when my hand wouldn't sweat, and that really kind of scared me. The ball 
felt like an ice cube." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's audition for steady employment with the Rams will soon be over, 
and Rubley said: "To stand there and be just a ballboy is awfully tough. I love 
the game and this is something I just love to do, but I can't do it now."

$1.1-MILLION AWARD VOIDED IN COBB CASE; JURISPRUDENCE: RULING BY JUDGE SEEN AS 
VICTORY FOR USC OVER FORMER ASSISTANT ATHLETIC DIRECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge voided a $1.1-million jury award to former USC Assistant Athletic 
Director Marvin Cobb on Wednesday, possibly clearing the way for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb, who is black, sued USC in 1990, claiming that he was denied a promotion 
because of racial bias. He won his case last June, and a Los Angeles Superior 
Court jury awarded him $2.1 million, a sum reduced last month to $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge William Drake voided the award entirely, agreeing with USC counsel 
Johnnie Cochran on two key points: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At least one juror acted improperly during deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There was "insufficient evidence" to support the jury's June verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a double win for us, and we're quite happy about it," USC general 
counsel Bob Lane said. "If Judge Drake's ruling is overturned on appeal, then 
we start over with a new trial. If things stay as they are, we've won our 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb, who in the 1970s played football for USC and the Cincinnati Bengals, 
also claimed in his suit that he was unfairly penalized for complaining that 
USC's black athletes weren't getting the education promised them. 
</P>
<P>
 He had criticized USC in a 1990 Sports Illustrated article, detailing problems 
he said USC athletes had encountered in getting academic counseling.  
</P>
<P>
 USC contended throughout the case that Cobb, hired by USC in 1986, was not 
promoted because his job performance did not warrant it and that he hadn't kept 
regular office hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Cobb was transferred out of the athletic department and into the 
university's medical school, where he was given an administrative post. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deadlocked on the racial bias element in Cobb's suit. He was 
originally awarded $1 million in emotional damages and $1.1 million in economic 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, some jurors later said, one female juror claiming to have a 
law degree raised points of law unrelated to the case.  
</P>
<P>
 And Drake said Wednesday he was disturbed to read that the juror had referred 
to a previous jury experience as when she "helped apply the law as per the 
judge's instructions." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a "sense of chivalry," Drake said, prevented him from issuing a contempt 
citation to the juror. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb could not be reached for comment.

JIM MURRAY: EVERY MAN TO HIS SPECIALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes the worst thing you can do in this business is appear to take the 
side of management in a labor dispute. It's politically incorrect. It's 
elitist. It can run you afoul of the implacables of our civilization, the ones 
who think they know what's good for society and you better get in line, Buster, 
if you know what's good for you! 
</P>
<P>
 But I have to say I found jarring a note in an essay published in our paper 
the other day by someone named Neal Gabler in which he wrote: "If there is a 
baseball strike . . . rest assured the players will be the ones castigated." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds: "It is a peculiar turn of events that has the fans demonizing the 
players and siding with the plutocrats. We are supposed to be a meritocracy, 
and there may be no more meritocratic institution than sports. Breeding, 
wealth, connections count for nothing on the athletic field. Only talent 
matters. Mike Piazza earns his salary because he can whack a ball out of a 
stadium. What did Dodger owner Peter O'Malley do to earn his millions aside 
from having the good fortune to be Walter O'Malley's son?" 
</P>
<P>
 Whoa! Wait just a darn minute there, Neal! Time! 
</P>
<P>
 You say Peter O'Malley -- to single out one owner -- didn't do anything except 
be Walter O'Malley's son? 
</P>
<P>
 Let me ask you something: What did Barry Bonds really do except be Bobby 
Bonds' son -- and Grandfather Bonds' grandson? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe all Peter O'Malley had to say was, "Thanks, Dad!" Maybe all he had to do 
was wake up one day and his inheritance was in place? OK. But so was Barry 
Bonds'. So was Mike Piazza's. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter O'Malley got from his father rich trusts, the Dodgers, the real estate 
-- and the corporate savvy to run them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barry Bonds (or Mike Piazza) got from his father the 20/20 (or better) 
vision, the reflexes of a young deer, the strength to hit a ball 400 feet or 
more on demand. Barry Bonds and Mike Piazza should say, "Thanks, Dad," and 
thank all their ancestors, too, for their legacy. For which they had to do 
nothing, either. It came in the will, so to speak. And therefore they should 
say thanks for the $7 million or so they will make each year from that legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature made them athletes. Well, nature made O'Malley a businessman. He hits 
his curveball, too. 
</P>
<P>
 You say, all he has to do is sit there and clip coupons? Well, all the average 
outfielder has to do is stand out there all night long blowing bubble gum or 
spitting tobacco. And brushing by autograph seekers by growling at them, "Get a 
life!" 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it is the long-held conceit here that the game of baseball was put 
in place by neither owners nor players. It's an old story with me, but I take 
the position it was put in place by writers, dramatists if you will, poets of 
the press box who extolled it, saw in it a national metaphor for America and 
its dreams. You think some center fielder first called it "the National 
Pastime?" You think some general manager wrote a poem about "Tinker to Evers to 
Chance?" Who made it a "Field of Dreams?" Some second baseman? No. Some 
ink-stained wretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me ask you: You ever see an organized baseball park without a press box? 
The Lardner family handed down a love of the game and an aptitude for 
dramatizing it, fully contributing to the dominant economic position it now 
occupies as much as any family with an aptitude for playing it. 
</P>
<P>
 What I'm trying to say is, the grand old game -- Who do you think first called 
it that? -- needs more than just guys who can play it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballplayers have always come from, so to speak, the other side of the tracks. 
You don't get athletes out of silk-sheet America. You get them off the farms, 
out of the canebrakes. They are the natural selection of generations of 
progenitors who chopped cotton, split rails, baled hay, plowed ground, grew 
wheat. Their stomachs are hard, their hands strong, their nerves steady. From 
Ty Cobb to Hank Aaron, they are either country boys or they come from a long 
line of country boys, hard-muscled, superb physical specimens. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't make them more "meritorious" than guys who got none of this from 
their parents, guys whose eyesight is 20/50, who can't go down to first base in 
3.5 seconds or run the 40 in 4.3, guys who were bequeathed only the family 
jewel, money, guys who were, in a sense, deprived. 
</P>
<P>
 The French have a saying, "Chacun a son gout" -- "Every man to his specialty" 
-- and what is wrong with inheriting an eye for a balance sheet, a talent for 
business, even a family team? If you don't get the hard belly, the fleet legs, 
the home run stroke, what is so unmeritorious about a head for business? Nature 
compensates. No one gets it all. 
</P>
<P>
 I take no position on the current strike talks. Neither do I condemn the labor 
leaders because they can't hit the ball as far as Mike Piazza. Nor do I fault 
them that they don't know what it is to run a team. They do what they do. We 
all do. Maybe their fathers bequeathed them a talent for negotiation instead of 
a talent for hitting or throwing the curve. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball is lucky to have these superb athletes. But they're lucky to have 
baseball. The ability to hit the curveball would otherwise be of limited use in 
our society. 
</P>
<P>
 If Peter O'Malley inherited business acumen -- and the Dodgers -- from his 
father, what is so wrong about that? You're going to make him give it back? Not 
unless you make Barry Bonds give his inheritance back. Which he did nothing to 
earn. Didn't even pay taxes on. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to get off the world because you can't bunt.

SUDDENLY, MAJORS HAVE A FOREIGN FEEL; GOLF: THE PGA CHAMPIONSHIP, WHICH BEGINS 
TODAY, IS THE LAST CHANCE AMERICANS HAVE THIS YEAR TO WIN A BIG ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's today's golf quiz: What is important, shows up four times a year and 
belongs to foreigners? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's a major tournament, namely the Masters, U.S. Open and British 
Open, which this year have been about as American as paella. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain, who got the golf ball rolling 
with his victory in the Masters, the trophies from the majors have become 
foreign possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 After Olazabal's success at Augusta, South Africans Ernie Els and Nick Price 
won the U.S. Open and British Open. 
</P>
<P>
 You know what this means, don't you? 
</P>
<P>
 The PGA Championship, last major of the year beginning today in heat and 
humidity at Southern Hills Country Club, offers the final chance for Americans 
to avoid making golf history. 
</P>
<P>
 Never have U.S. golfers failed to win at least one major event in a year since 
the Masters joined the other three in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the first time, unless something happens by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 John Daly said he thinks an American is going to win it this year, even though 
it probably isn't going to be him and he had a hard time thinking of somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel that way . . . I think if Fuzzy (Zoeller) starts making some 
putts, I think he's got a really good shot at winning," Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 American golfers are well aware they're getting shut out in the majors. If 
it's bothering them, well, nobody says so. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical are the comments by Fred Couples.  
</P>
<P>
 Couples said he doesn't even remember who won the other majors in 1992, when 
he won the Masters. (Note to Fred: Tom Kite won the U.S. Open, Nick Faldo the 
British Open and Price the PGA.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't really matter to me," Couples said. "You know I go out there and 
try and play. If I don't win and my best buddy doesn't win, I don't care if 
it's a guy from here or there because (he is) the best player that week. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean we should have some kind of feeling that he's not an 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, would it be nice for an American to win? Sure. Would it be nice for 
a foreigner to win? Yes. It's never been done to win all four of them." 
</P>
<P>
 It's certain somebody is going to win on the 6,834-yard, par-70 layout, a 
tree-lined excursion through Oklahoma real estate that begs shotmaking and 
course management more than long-ball drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Faldo said his style of play seems right for Southern Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a blasting golf course, it's all positioning," he said. "That suits 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the holes are doglegs and the greens are on the smallish side. The 
rough is not especially tall, but is thick and difficult to play aggressively 
because of the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to fade drives," said Couples, who is going to a three-wood every 
hole and may not even use a driver. "I don't even know if there is a straight 
hole." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Couples, the greens are "semi-slow," the rough "semi-thick." And 
if an American golfer doesn't win, it won't be semi-tough to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 37 foreign golfers in the PGA, and a foreign player has won the PGA 
twice in the last four years -- Wayne Grady in 1990 and Price in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, foreign golfers have won six of the last seven Masters. Non-Americans 
have also won 10 of the last 11 British Opens. The U.S. Open is the last major 
stronghold for American golfers, who had won 12 in a row until Els' victory in 
June at Oakmont. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanny Wadkins might have a vested interest in this foreign-American thing 
because he is the Ryder Cup captain, an event in which nationality is all 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 Wadkins' U.S. team will defend its title next year against the Europeans at 
Oak Hill in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as any other tournament goes, including majors, no one is checking the 
passport of the winner, Wadkins said, adding:. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time we really wear the flag on our sleeve, so to speak, is in Ryder 
Cup matches. We're out here for ourselves. I don't have a team out here right 
now. It's just me. I could use a team right now." 
</P>
<P>
 In these majors, the foreign team has a big lead. 
</P>
<P>
 PGA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a whammy on Lanny? Lanny Wadkins said here's how you tell: "I've been 
hitting it short and crooked, which is not a good combination." This is true. 
It hasn't been such a great year for Wadkins, 44, the Ryder Cup captain who has 
been playing like a buck private. Wadkins has played in 19 tournaments and made 
the cut only five times. Besides a tie for 18th in the Masters, his best other 
finish is a tie for 50th in the Hawaiian Open. The 1977 PGA champion hasn't won 
a tournament in two years but believes he is on the rebound after studying a 
series of photographs of his swing taken the year he won his only major title 
at Pebble Beach. "I saw me swinging real good," Wadkins said. "I'll play well 
again. There's nothing wrong with me physically. I don't have any nerve 
problems. . . .at least, I won't until I'm sitting there watching these guys 
play at Ryder Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 John Daly doesn't sound too confident about his chances in the PGA, which he 
won three years ago at Crooked Stick. "I don't think I've ever hit the ball as 
bad as I'm doing right now," said Daly, who has played three practice rounds at 
Southern Hills. He is also having muscle trouble in his lower back, which is 
affecting his swing. "I'm having major problems following through," he said. 
"I'm leaving a lot of my shots way right. Actually shanked a couple. Now I know 
how amateurs feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus said he isn't saying anything more regarding his recent comments 
about the small number of blacks in pro golf, as reported recently by the 
Vancouver Province. Nicklaus was quoted as saying, "Blacks have different 
muscles that react in different ways."

FOREMAN COMEBACK RUNS INTO A DETOUR; BOXING: TITLE FIGHT AGAINST MOORER 
SCRAPPED WHEN WBA REFUSES TO SANCTION IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is this the end of George Foreman's last great comeback? 
</P>
<P>
 Facing only one last bureaucratic hurdle, the scheduled Nov. 5 heavyweight 
title bout between champion Michael Moorer and challenger Foreman, 46, was 
scrapped Wednesday when the World Boxing Assn. refused to sanction the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Although HBO, which had planned to televise the fight, and the fighters' 
management groups considered going ahead anyway, Moorer refused when told the 
WBA planned to take away his belt if he fought Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer also is the champion of the International Boxing Federation, which had 
agreed to sanction the Foreman bout. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we did the fight, the WBA was going to strip us," said John Davimos, 
Moorer's manager. "I went to Michael, and he said he will not get stripped. 
He's not giving up a belt for George Foreman, and he was adamant about it; 
money was not the question. I was sort of proud of him for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, who won the titles last April by defeating Evander Holyfield, probably 
will make his first title defense on the November date against Joe Hipp. 
</P>
<P>
 Davimos said that when the Moorer camp was told the WBA would not sanction a 
Foreman challenge, presumably because it did not consider him a legitimate 
contender, the camp asked for a waiver to allow Moorer to defend his IBF title 
without being stripped by the WBA. The WBA, Davimos said, voted down the 
proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 This marks the second major title defense that has fallen from Moorer's grasp. 
Davimos was close to arranging a unification bout against World Boxing Council 
champion Lennox Lewis earlier this year when Lewis surprisingly signed a deal 
to fight former champion Riddick Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Arum, Foreman's promoter, criticized the Moorer camp for allowing the WBA 
to wreck the Foreman fight and said it was "an act of cowardice" on Moorer's 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 "George is very disappointed, very angry," Arum said. "They can't pull out 
like this. The contract says they have to pursue every avenue, every appeal 
before they can pull out."

PERFORMANCE

 Jack Morris' release from the Cleveland Indians was not a result of his 
spending off days at his ranch in Montana, team officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove said Morris, who had a 10-6 record, would show 
up the day before he was scheduled to pitch and then return to Great Falls, 
Mont., immediately after the game.Morris, 39, told the Indians some of his help 
had quit and he had to help with the wheat harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason for his release is the way he pitched in his last five starts, not 
because he was going back and forth," Hargrove said Tuesday night. "The way 
Jack was pitching, it was hard for us to stay competitive in the pennant race. 
And we just didn't see it getting any better."

IN CASE OF STRIKE HEAD DIRECTLY TO A CLASS-A GAME; BASEBALL: CALIFORNIA LEAGUE 
HOPES TO CASH IN ON PROVIDING FANS WITH A LOW-COST ALTERNATIVE.

 California League general managers are like owners of funeral homes these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come," they tell baseball fans sympathetically. "Grieve with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Minor league teams will open their arms and their gates, welcoming baseball 
fans after the major league players begin their expected strike Friday. And 
like the owner of a funeral home, minor league owners will be counting their 
money through the tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a strike, however long or short, is bad for the game," Lake Elsinore 
Storm General Manager Kevin Haughian said. "But in the short term, I think it 
is help for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Storm and the Riverside Pilots will exchange tickets from major league 
games for tickets to their games. The four other California League teams in 
Southern California have no such plans -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest promotion during the strike is that our players will be on the 
field," said San Bernardino Spirit General Manager Jim Wehmeier. 
</P>
<P>
 So will the players from the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, Bakersfield Dodgers and 
High Desert Mavericks. The Class-A California League will be the state's only 
professional baseball if major leaguers walk out. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the six Southern California teams, all within a two-hour drive of 
the San Fernando Valley, have their fingers crossed that fans will take 
advantage of the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping," Rancho Cucamonga ticket manager Kelly Smith said. "They've got 
to get their baseball fix somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 A rush of fans to minor league parks may have long-term benefits after the 
strike ends, the California League general managers figure, because the strike 
will be a way to coax fans to experience their product. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll get a lot of major league fans coming to minor league parks and they'll 
see we put on a better show anyway," Wehmeier said. "They'll say, 'I paid 25 
bucks (for a family) and they put on a pretty good show, instead of paying a 
lot more to watch a bunch of overpaid prima donnas.' 
</P>
<P>
 "All the things that are wrong with major league baseball right now are 
exactly what's right with minor league baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Because minor league players are largely unknown and generally spend no more 
than one season in a city, teams market their atmosphere and facilities more 
than the product on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got controlled lunacy," Haughian said. "Our general operation 
philosophy is we want people to leave and say, 'I went to Disneyland and a 
baseball game broke out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly a minor league game goes by without some 3-year-old circling the bases 
in a between-innings race against a green dinosaur. Or without fans checking to 
see if "double to right field" corresponds to the spot they need to fill on 
their bingo cards to win an order of gooey nachos. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballparks themselves also are attractions. Minor league philosophy of 
late: Build a new stadium and start collecting money. The Quakes opened their 
park, fittingly called the Epicenter, last season and drew more than 330,000 
fans. The next highest total was High Desert, in Adelanto. Maverick Stadium, 
opened four seasons ago, drew more than 190,000 fans in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The jewel of the league this year is Lake Elsinore's new park, The Diamond. 
Built at a cost of more than $20 million, The Diamond opened this season when 
the Angels' Cal League affiliate moved from Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is shades of Ebbets Field and Wrigley Field, but with all the amenities of 
a modern-day facility," Haughian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haughian said more than 8,000 fans can be squeezed into the ballpark, 
including 450 at a sit-down restaurant in the left-field corner. Even without 
the help of a major league strike, Haughian expects Lake Elsinore to break the 
Cal League attendance record set last year by Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance climbed throughout the minor leagues in 1981, when major league 
players went on strike for 50 days. But Riverside General Manager Jack Patton 
isn't sure the results will be the same in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major league strike will be a positive influence (on the minors), but how 
big an influence I'm not sure," he said. "Fans may just be ticked off at 
baseball and focus on football." Class-A Alternative 
</P>
<P>
 With major league baseball players expected to go on strike Friday, Southland 
fans will have to turn to the California League, a minor league, for their 
professional baseball. Fortunately, six teams in the Class-A League are within 
two hours of Los Angeles.

SYLMAR AGAIN IN HOT WATER WITH CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sylmar High football team, already on probation for committing a City 
Section violation last fall, might have broken additional rules by 
participating in a passing competition Tuesday against players from Pierce 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 By participating, Sylmar might have violated several California 
Interscholastic Federation and City rules, City Commissioner Barbara Fiege 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Backs and receivers from Sylmar and Pierce played in a non-contact exercise 
comparable to passing-league competition, Pierce Coach Bill Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
 City teams began preseason conditioning Aug. 1, signaling the official 
beginning of the season of sport. Interaction with other teams during the 
conditioning period is not permitted, Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar also might have violated a rule regarding contact with players who 
exceed the CIF maximum age limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, a City rule prohibits athletic interaction of any kind with 
college athletes, including during the off-season summer months. Fiege said she 
will begin investigating today. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman said he misunderstood what was prohibited during 
conditioning and was unaware that contact with college players also was barred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought as long as it wasn't full-contact stuff, it was OK," Engilman said. 
"The last thing I want to do is get these kids in trouble. I know I'm already 
on probation." 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Sylmar was placed on one year of probation for holding a team 
meeting over the Labor Day weekend, a violation of City rules. The violation, 
widely publicized, was captured on videotape by an assistant coach from a rival 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar, which annually ranks among the area's best programs, could face stiff 
penalties if the violations prove true. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violations of probation are treated very harshly," Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton invited Engilman to participate in the workout approximately three 
weeks ago during an all-star high school football game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know the City rules," Norton said. "I'm in shock."

RESOLUTE WADE FIGHTS BACK FROM DEBILITATING INJURY; COURAGE: COMMUNITY RALLIES 
BEHIND CANYON HIGH COACH, GAINING AFTER AUTO ACCIDENT LEFT HIM PARALYZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Chuck Wade pondered a question, he reached up with his left hand and 
scratched his head. It was a common reflex of uncommon magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months ago Wade, an assistant coach in football and track and field at 
Canyon High, was paralyzed from the chest down in an auto accident. His spinal 
cord was nearly severed and he had little use of his arms, none of his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing months brought a succession of operations, severe bed sores and a 
lawsuit against his insurance carrier. Plus the terror of experiencing the Jan. 
17 earthquake from the fourth floor of the Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Now here he is, bedridden but unbowed, accentuating comments with hand 
gestures, rubbing his bushy gray mustache, scratching an itch. 
</P>
<P>
 Every mundane movement is the equivalent of Wade thrusting a fist into the air 
and shouting, "See this, World, I'm on my way back." 
</P>
<P>
 Wade, 55, is more understated than all that, however. He is quietly resolute, 
believing he will someday walk, the pessimistic prognosis of doctors 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the doctors believe isn't important," he said, tapping his heart and 
grinning. "It's what I believe that matters. The biggest thing is me." 
</P>
<P>
 Wade is out of the hospital and staying in a residential home in Chatsworth 
that provides 24-hour care. He and a handful of other patients, including his 
roommate, David Wilson, son of comedian Flip Wilson, receive therapy designed 
to prepare them to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 Home for Wade has long been Canyon Country, where he raised his daughter 
Jennifer, 25, and son Joey, 23, and went through a divorce a decade ago. He has 
taught mathematics at the high school for 22 years, and coached, at various 
times, boys' and girls' basketball, football and field events such as shotput 
and discus. 
</P>
<P>
 Patience, understanding and a personal touch, that's the reputation Wade 
developed as a coach. A counselor with a whistle draped around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck has always been there for other people, his own children and other 
people's children," said Mike Kill, a teacher and coach at Canyon who 
frequently visits Wade. "He is especially good one-on-one, just talking to a 
kid, getting his priorities in order." 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet pep talks Wade for so long gave to athletes now are targeted inward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Preaching to young people that you can achieve anything if you set your mind 
to it is something I did," Wade said. "Positive thinking and becoming the best 
you can be, in the classroom and in athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this," he said, motioning to his legs that have no feeling, "I can't let 
things get me down. I have to be positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Goal-setting is crucial. He plans to attend Canyon football games this fall. 
He plans to return to teaching in 1995. He plans to return to his home away 
from home, the High Sierra, for fly fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rivers and streams are waiting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything is possible. He's already making out his own bills and writing 
letters. The right-handed Wade can write with either hand because his left was 
the first to gain movement and he couldn't wait to get started. 
</P>
<P>
 Home itself is on the horizon as well. Wade said that within a month or so he 
will be back in Canyon Country, living with friend and coaching mate Augie 
Williams, who has prepared his home for Wade and his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's built some ramps and widened some doors," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Positive thinking can lapse into stubbornness, however. Wade recently broke 
his right hip during a therapy session. It will take four to six weeks to heal 
but, not wanting to delay his return home, he chose not to mention the injury 
to Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know about the hip problem, but that's OK," said Williams, whose 
relentlessly cheery outlook matches that of his friend. "I'm just concerned 
with the happy part, getting him out of the wheelchair, making progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Wade wards off any inkling of negativity. Allow it to creep into his 
consciousness even for a moment, and it might stay for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who visit him can only admire his spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is such a big, beautiful man, full of life and energy," said Harry Welch, 
the Canyon football coach from 1982 to 1993. "You see him and leave convinced 
he's in a better situation than you are. He just wills himself to improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Community response after the accident was tremendous, no doubt fueled by 
Wade's popularity. Former players visited him in large groups. Fund-raisers, 
such as A Buck for Chuck, were hugely successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch solicited generous donations from Raiders' owner Al Davis and Rams' 
Coach Chuck Knox, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Track Coach Dave DeLong took pledges for each mile he rode in a bicycle race 
from Solvang to Santa Maria. The next day, DeLong again took pledges and ran in 
the L.A. Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had kids give me their lunch money every day for Chuck," said Gary 
Lindberg, a Canyon teacher and coach who also rode in the bicycle race and 
assisted in the fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade, of course, feels indebted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to thank the community a lot more," he said. "What a fantastic group 
of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Wade's friends seem to have more difficulty coping with his plight 
than he does. Lindberg hasn't visited Wade since March, despite coaching with 
Wade for many years. The pair frequently took their sons on fishing expeditions 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a very difficult time going to see him," Lindberg said. "I know 
Chuck a certain way, and . . ." His voice cracking through tears, Lindberg 
rattled off a list of personal hardships that have occupied his time. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade wants only to throw his arms over Lindberg's shoulders and share a laugh. 
That way, all the daily lifting of 10-pound barbells to strengthen his arms 
will have served a noble purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough on Gary," Wade said, chuckling. "I'm not at all angry or 
disappointed in him. When I get out of here we'll be up to the same old stuff. 
If he was in this position, it would be tough for me. He's my good old bud." 
</P>
<P>
 A trace of bitterness surfaces only when the arbitrary nature of the accident 
is mentioned. Wade was driving back to Canyon a little past 11 p.m. on Oct. 22, 
having dropped off the team manager at home after a football game at Burroughs 
High. A Volkswagen driven by a 17-year-old Canyon student barreled past him, 
catching his bumper and sending Wade's Toyota 4-Runner tumbling four to six 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was conscious, wondering what the heck was going on," said Wade, who was 
wearing a seat belt. "Finally I hit a pole and stopped rolling. I didn't really 
feel pain, but I couldn't feel certain parts of my body." 
</P>
<P>
 Positive thinking or no, Wade has a stern message for young drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids have to learn, if you are in a car, take that seriously," he said. "Cars 
are deadly weapons, and the person you hurt may not be yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he brightens, however. Like a balloon, his spirit rises effortlessly. 
This is Chuck Wade's true nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was spared," he said. "I was lucky. It was God saying: 'Wade, here's a 
chance, a second life. See how you handle this.' It is my responsibility to 
meet that challenge. I need to get back as close as possible to what I was 
before."

SALSA PLANS ARE PUT ON HOLD; SOCCER: SPORT'S GOVERNING BODIES RECONSIDER AND 
MAY BLOCK TEAM'S PLAY IN MEXICO'S NEW DIVISION 1-A LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a month before the Salsa is scheduled to begin play in Mexico's new 
soccer league, the team has encountered opposition from two of the sport's 
governing bodies that might stop its participation, team officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa was approved to compete in Mexico's Division 1-A on June 26 by a 
10-8 vote of the U.S. Soccer Federation's board of directors. The team planned 
to start play when the league's inaugural season opens Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 However, FIFA, the international governing body of soccer, told team 
management Aug. 2 that it is reviewing the Salsa's petition to play south of 
the border. CONCACAF, the regional governing body that oversees Central 
America, North America and the Caribbean, is expressing concern over the 
Salsa's inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project is still alive," Salsa owner William De La Pena said. "We've 
talked with FIFA and CONCACAF, and we're working very hard for them to approve 
the project. We're very optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Pena could not explain why snags are occurring after the team believed 
the deal was completed, especially with kickoff for the new league so close. He 
believes part of the organizations' apprehension is because protocol was not 
followed, and that the plan might conflict with certain statutes. FIFA and 
CONCACAF were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Pena expects a decision soon. He needs a quick resolution if the Salsa 
is to prepare for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa announced its final 1994 schedule changes, necessitated by the 
Houston Force leaving the American Professional Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa added an away game, changed opponents for three home dates and 
changed the date of another game. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised schedule (all times Pacific): 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday -- Colorado, 7:35 p.m.; Aug. 20 -- Vancouver, 7:35 p.m.; Aug. 26 -- 
at Vancouver, 7:35 p.m.; Aug. 27 -- at Seattle, 7:35 p.m.; Aug. 31 -- Ft. 
Lauderdale, 7:35 p.m.; Sept. 2 -- at Montreal, 4:35 p.m.; Sept. 4 -- Toronto, 
6:05 p.m.; Sept. 11 -- Seattle, 6:05 p.m.; Sept. 17 -- Vancouver, 7:35 p.m.; 
Sept. 21 -- at Vancouver, 7:35 p.m.; Sept. 25 -- Colorado, 6:05 p.m.

 It's that time of the preseason when the entrance to Raider training camp 
could use a revolving door. And some names should probably be written on the 
roster in pencil -- one equipped with a large eraser. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the Raiders released veteran defensive back Rickey Dixon for the 
second time this summer. Also released for the second time was rookie running 
back James Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Added to the roster in their places were defensive lineman Tim Rother and 
defensive back Lester Ridley, the latter back for his second tour of duty this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon, a six-year veteran, had been a Cincinnati Bengal until the Raiders 
acquired him in a trade before last season. Dixon was cut last month, then 
re-signed at a lower salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, signed as a free agent, had been cut in mid-July and re-signed a week 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Rother, 6 feet 7 and 280 pounds, has played on both the offensive and 
defensive lines. Ridley, signed as a free agent, had been cut in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Alexander Wright, who has sat out both exhibition games because 
of an injured calf muscle, practiced Wednesday, but Coach Art Shell isn't ready 
to let him play in Saturday's exhibition game against the Steelers at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's like a wild stallion," Shell said. "He's very close (to returning). But 
I'm a little nervous about the artificial turf (at Three Rivers Stadium). If he 
does play, it will not be much." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell said he plans to return offensive tackle Bruce Wilkerson, who has had a 
sprained foot, to the lineup. STEVE SPRINGER

HAMELIN DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A ROOKIE -- OR ACT LIKE ONE; BASEBALL: ROYALS' 
26-YEAR-OLD DH, WHO PLAYED AT IRVINE AND RANCHO SANTIAGO, HAS EMERGED AS 
LEADING CANDIDATE FOR TOP AL AWARD. 
</P>

<P>
 Bob Hamelin is no ordinary rookie. The statistics that go up in lights when 
the Kansas City designated hitter steps to the plate tell you that. 
Emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
 But look at him, pushing 27, with a bat and a belly and a No. 3 on his back 
that inevitably leads people to call him the Babe. Where's the rookie in a guy 
who shuffles around the clubhouse in shower shoes with an air that says he's 
seen it all, and it's not half bad? 
</P>
<P>
 The only ounce of rookie in all the 235 pounds on Hamelin's six-foot frame is 
this: He had played in only 16 major league games in his life before this 
season. That's few enough to make you eligible for rookie of the year whether 
you're 19 or 98. And Hamelin, with a team-leading 24 homers and 65 runs batted 
in as well as a .282 average, has emerged as the leading candidate for American 
League Rookie of the Year -- or, who knows, perhaps Rookie of the 
Strike-Shortened Season. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hamelin wins, he'll earn the oxymoronic distinction of being the oldest 
rookie of the year in either league since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Todd Worrell, now a Dodger, turned 27 in September of the season he 
won the NL rookie of the year award as a St. Louis Cardinal in 1986. Hamelin 
will be 27 on Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's more mature than most rookies," Royal Manager Hal McRae said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you'd told Hamelin six years ago he'd be in the running for rookie of the 
year in 1994, he wouldn't have thought that was such great news. As a 
second-round pick in 1986 from Rancho Santiago College -- where he set a state 
record by hitting 31 homers in a season -- Hamelin and most everyone who knew 
him figured he'd be in the majors long before now. 
</P>
<P>
 But chronic back problems derailed his career for parts of four seasons, and 
after the problem was finally identified as a stress fracture of a vertebra, he 
underwent surgery in 1991. He finally put together his first full season as a 
pro last year with triple-A Omaha. Now that he has made it, he's just glad to 
finally be where he figured he was headed all along. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than Omaha, I know that," Hamelin said, laughing. "I had enough 
steak and potatoes there. Kansas City has a lot of steak, too, but it tastes 
better there." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, part of the reason he's making such a run for rookie of the 
year is that, after all he's been through, Hamelin is no rookie at heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's helped me because I'm a little older," he said. "Maybe somebody 
who's 21 comes up to the major leagues and fails for the first time. But I've 
had adversity in the past. I think maybe having some of the problems I've had 
is going to help me with the slumps or that kind of thing, because I've already 
had some adversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Not much this year, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Hamelin said, laughing. "But I've had enough in the past to make up for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of starting hot and flaming out (remember J.T. Snow?), Hamelin has 
done what most rookies find the hardest to do: He has sustained it. It hasn't 
mattered that the pitchers know him now. In fact, he has been on one of his 
hottest tears lately. He had an eight-game hitting streak stopped Wednesday 
night, and has hit around .400 over the last three weeks, leaving Bo Jackson's 
Royals' record of 22 homers by a rookie in the dust in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Mayne, who has known Hamelin since Hamelin played at Irvine High School, 
now dresses next to him in the Royals' clubhouse. Mayne, a catcher and the son 
of Mike Mayne, former Orange Coast College baseball coach, has watched hundreds 
of players try to make the big leagues. He has learned who makes it and who 
doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be honest, I never had a doubt in my mind he was capable of all this," 
Mayne said. "With my dad coaching, I've been around a lot of players. I've 
learned what it takes to be successful. He plays baseball as if he weren't 
here, as if he'd be in the Dominican or somewhere playing. It doesn't revolve 
around success or failure. It's what he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Hamelin's back trouble didn't make Mayne doubt that Hamelin -- drafted 
the year before him -- would eventually join him in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always convinced that guys like that are not stoppable," Mayne said. 
"Their personality is such that he can't be put down as long as he keeps 
trying." 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of sluggers and DHs who are no students of the game -- plenty 
aren't even students of the strike zone. But Mayne remembers how Hamelin would 
always show up around Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "College, high school, any game, he'd be there, watching," Mayne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Hamelin does his studying on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's part of my game, part of my success," he said. "I like to have an idea 
what's coming. Everyone's a little different and has a different way of going 
about things. Some hitters think too much about it and they're not going to be 
successful. I'm the opposite. I like to study and get the best advantage I 
possibly can. I think that helps me. I think some players feel it hurts them." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many players, he keeps his own notebook on pitchers' strengths, 
weaknesses and tendencies. Like about half the Royals' team, he sits down 
before a series to look at tape of his previous at-bats against the pitchers 
he'll be facing. And like few others, he actually goes back to the video room 
at Royals Stadium during a game to see what he can pick up from previous 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's a little luxury of being the designated hitter," he said. "I 
don't have to go out on the field, so I've got to kill some time." 
</P>
<P>
 As if he didn't have to kill enough on his way to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does seem like this is a good reward for all those years," Mayne said.

CANON TO PAY $633,000 IN JOB BIAS PROBE; WORKPLACE: SETTLEMENT WITH 32 
APPLICANTS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST OF ITS KIND. COMPANY ADMITS NO WRONGDOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In one of the largest settlements of alleged discrimination in hiring by a 
federal contractor in California, Canon Business Machines has agreed to pay as 
much as $633,000 to 30 blacks, a Latino and a white woman who were denied jobs 
for which they were qualified, federal officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Labor Department reviewed Canon's hiring records for 1992 and found 
that 1,732 job applications were submitted, including 100 from blacks. The 
Costa Mesa-based unit of giant Canon Inc. of Japan eventually hired 96 people 
that year, but not a single black person was offered employment, investigators 
said, even though 30 clearly met job requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a significant settlement," said Leonard Bierman, deputy director of 
the Office of the Federal Contract Compliance Programs in Washington. "You had 
30 people qualified enough to have been hired, but they didn't get the fair 
share." 
</P>
<P>
 Canon Business Machines, which employs about 550 people, agreed to the 
settlement without asking for a hearing or admitting to having discriminated 
against the applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the incident not only angered some in the African American community, 
it also dismayed those representing Japanese-owned corporations in the United 
States, which have come under stinging criticism in recent years for allegedly 
discriminating against minorities and women in hiring and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how a large company like Canon can discriminate. I couldn't 
believe it," said Bill Kita, executive director of the Japanese Business Assn. 
of Southern California, which has 620 member firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had problems at Japanese-owned firms, and obviously this is an 
indication," said Angel Luevano, director of operations at the Office of the 
Federal Contract Compliance Programs' regional office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal official Bierman said Canon's case represents the biggest employment 
discrimination settlement involving a Japanese-owned contractor to the U.S. 
government in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Luevano and other Labor Department officials emphasized that there is 
no data to suggest that Japanese-owned companies are violating equal employment 
rules more than other corporations. The last time the agency studied the issue 
was in 1991, when Congress held hearings on allegations of job bias by 
Japanese-owned firms based in the United States. In that study, the agency 
found that the violation rate was about the same as at other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, critics cite a number of private lawsuits filed in Southern 
California and elsewhere as evidence that a problem persists. The allegations 
against Canon, a maker of copiers and cameras with annual revenues of $16 
billion, are the latest example, critics said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious that they discriminated, and I'm delighted the Department of 
Labor has taken punitive action," said Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Burlingame), who 
chaired the subcommittee that held the hearings in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Canon Business Machines was closed this week for a companywide vacation, and 
its executives could not be reached for comment. Russell Marchetta, a spokesman 
for Canon USA, said he did not have enough information to comment about the 
case except to say that "Our hiring policy is the law of the land," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation, which began in March, was carried out by the Labor 
Department division that enforces equal employment at all companies that do 
business with the government. Canon Business Machines sells copy machines to 
the federal government. The probe by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance 
Programs was part of a routine inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Padilla, the Labor Department official who oversaw the investigation, said 
Canon Business Machines argued that the black applicants were not qualified. 
But "we proved they were qualified," Padilla said, "and in many instances the 
blacks were better qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 George Williams, president of the Orange County Urban League, an advocacy 
group for blacks and other minorities, said he was not entirely surprised by 
the Canon incident. Over the years, he said, he has made a number of job 
referrals to Canon Business Machines, but none were answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said a few Japanese-owned firms in Orange County are making a strong 
effort to hire minorities. But they are the exception, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Canon Business Machines settlement, the company agreed to pay the 30 
African American applicants -- plus one Latino man and one woman, both of whom 
were denied engineering jobs -- amounts ranging from several hundred dollars to 
$70,000. The payment represents the wages they would have earned through July 
had they been hired, minus what they earned at other jobs during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Canon agreed to offer employment to 14 of the black applicants as 
well as the two others. But several of those in the group of 30 said they would 
not accept the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Dixon applied for a job as a materials handler at Canon in 1992, when he 
arrived in Orange County from recession-battered Colorado in search of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, I needed a job desperately," the 36-year-old Anaheim resident 
said. Dixon said he went to Canon and filled out an application. "The 
individual I handed the application to kind of looked at me and said, 'They'll 
be in contact.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Dixon never heard anything. "It hurts, you know," Dixon said. "I thought 
my qualifications were very good, and they said they were hiring." Later that 
summer, Dixon found a part-time job at a Ralphs supermarket in Compton, where 
he is still employed.

MEXICAN VOTE OF CONFIDENCE FOR ECONOMY; POLITICS: TECHNOCRATS CITE FAVORABLE 
ECONOMIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS DESPITE THE MOST CLOSELY CONTESTED PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION IN DECADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of the most closely contested presidential election in six decades, 
Mexico's famed technocrats are campaigning for the economy. And the message 
they are putting out is clear: that economic stability can be maintained here 
despite the growing likelihood of political change. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in this year of uprisings and assassination, the Mexican economy 
appears to have stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock prices are up, the rise in interest rates has reversed and the peso is 
slowly regaining strength. Manufacturing has finally begun to register growth 
after months of sluggishness and, as a bonus in this oil-rich nation, oil 
prices have risen to their highest levels since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Mexico expects to complete the first non-U.S. highway bond offering 
ever sold on international markets, highlighting the country's role as a leader 
in innovative financing among developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the reverse of what you might expect this close to an election" with 
such possibilities for radical change, said one government official. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, by U.S. standards, interest rates -- 15.8% on Wednesday -- are 
still too high, and other indicators, such as a projected trade deficit, seem 
less than favorable. And uncertainty remains a watchword. Yet this is the most 
favorable economic climate Mexico has enjoyed in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Those accomplishments are carefully noted when officials talk about why 
outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari should head the new World Trade 
Organization being formed as a successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade. They have also become effective counterpoints to dire warnings of 
collapse, linked to the outcome of the Aug. 21 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign bumper stickers for ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party 
candidate Ernesto Zedillo with the message "I Vote for Peace" carry a thinly 
veiled threat that an opposition victory will mean instability. Businessmen 
such as Roberto Hernandez, president of both the Mexican Bankers Assn. and 
Mexico's largest bank, have been more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was widely lampooned last month after he told an agribusiness 
seminar that of the nine presidential candidates, only Zedillo provides the 
certainty needed to bring interest rates down to their February level of 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the scorn his comments incurred was a cartoon in the independent 
newspaper La Jornada that depicted the banker threatening: "We have the 
country's capital held hostage. If Ernesto does not win, there could be 
instability and uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
 The technocrats make it clear that they expect Yale-educated economist Zedillo 
-- who is, after all, one of their own -- to win. But they dispute the 
possibility that an opposition victory will mean economic disaster, as some 
U.S. economists insist. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the respected CIEMEX-WEFA economic group based in Pennsylvania, 
referring to the center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), in third 
place in most polls, warned that "a PRD victory may cause capital outflows, 
loss of international reserves and strong pressures on the peso that could 
force a devaluation." 
</P>
<P>
 The economics group forecasts fewer problems if the second-place National 
Action Party, which has supported free-market reforms, were to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the possibility of an opposition victory after 65 years of 
one-party rule is inherently somewhat unsettling. However, changes via election 
seem tame compared to what Mexico has already been through this year, from a 
Jan. 1 Indian uprising in the southern state of Chiapas to the March 23 
assassination of ruling party candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder, especially, provoked devaluation jitters. The central bank spent 
up to $9 billion from international reserves to keep the peso from crashing in 
April, according to an estimate by the Mexico City-based economic analysts 
Grupo de Economistas y Asociados. 
</P>
<P>
 To slow the exit of dollars, the government decided to relieve investors of 
currency risk by stepping up its offering of dollar-denominated treasury bonds, 
called Tesobonos. The bills rose from 3% of the government's debt on Jan. 1 to 
42% last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We managed to give investors a hedge (against devaluation) without capital 
flight," said Treasury Minister Pedro Aspe.  
</P>
<P>
 As evidence of renewed faith in the peso, the government plans to cut the 
offering of Tesobonos to 37% of the treasury debt auctioned next month. 
Economic officials are adamant that a devaluation is not imminent, whatever the 
election outcome, and cite a spurt in exports as proof. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our exports have increased 27%," said another high-ranking government 
official, who, like many others interviewed, spoke on condition that he not be 
identified. "Where can you see this kind of increase when there are exchange 
rate problems? When there are exchange rate problems, there are also export 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, they are certain that ongoing free-market reforms -- which trimmed 
the triple-digit inflation of 1987 to a projected 6% this year and reduced 
government debt to 10% of the gross domestic product from 75% in 1986 -- are so 
clearly the right course for this nation that they will be followed by whoever 
is elected this month. 
</P>
<P>
 All three major presidential candidates have said they favor the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, the cornerstone of Mexico's new economic 
program. A resulting surge in U.S. exports to Mexico, economists here say, has 
helped lower inflation and made Mexican manufacturers more competitive by 
giving them access to better and cheaper machinery and raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Government economists even look to free-market economics to resolve the 
problems of poverty that led to the Indian uprising in Chiapas that was timed 
to upstage implementation of NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way to solve the problem of Chiapas without attracting 
investment," said one official. The Mexican Economy

<P>
 With inflation in check and a growing gross domestic product, the Mexican 
economy is enjoying a relatively stable period.

NEUTROGENA NEGOTIATING POSSIBLE SALE; CORPORATIONS: PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS 
FIRM, WHOSE STOCK HAS STRUGGLED, DESCRIBES SUITOR AS 'SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER 
COMPANY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Neutrogena Corp., which turned a line of transparent soap bars into a 
multimillion-dollar skin and hair care products business, said Wednesday that 
it is negotiating a possible sale of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Neutrogena revealed the talks with what it described as a 
"substantially larger company" after its once-languishing stock rose as high as 
$23 in heavy Nasdaq trading Wednesday. The stock, which traded as low as $16 
earlier this year, closed up 87.5 cents at $21.625. 
</P>
<P>
 Neutrogena said no agreement has been reached and that a deal is not certain. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been growing speculation in the health and beauty aids industry that 
Neutrogena, which is 45%-owned by Chairman Lloyd E. Cotsen and his family, was 
in serious buyout talks, said Lloyd Greif, president of Greif & Co., a Los 
Angeles-based investment banking firm. The potential buyers reportedly included 
Procter & Gamble, Maybelline and Chesebrough-Ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with slow sales, big consumer product companies have pursued growth by 
acquiring smaller but well-known cosmetics brand-name products and their 
makers. Last year, Canoga Park's Redken Laboratories was sold to L'Oreal, and a 
German cosmetics firm acquired a majority stake in Woodland Hills-based 
Sebastian. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a whole lot of activity recently in the personal care products 
business," said Greif, who also cited Procter & Gamble's recent purchase of 
Giorgio perfumes and cosmetics from Avon Corp. "Neutrogena is a significant 
player out there . . . and it's clear that the company is viewed as an 
attractive acquisition." 
</P>
<P>
 Neutrogena is prized for its well-known and highly regarded line of specialty 
soaps and hair care products sold through drugstores, supermarkets and other 
larger retailers. By creating a high-quality image for its soaps, Neutrogena 
has been able to distinguish a commodity product and charge a higher price than 
competitors. It has what marketing consultant Robert Grayson calls "mass chic." 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeals to (consumers) who would like extra status but don't want to pay 
extra money for it in a department store," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Originally called Natone Products in the 1950s, the company made lip brushes 
and other cosmetic products before it began marketing a transparent, 
amber-colored soap created by a Belgian doctor. The soap was named Neutrogena. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotsen, who joined the company in 1957, helped differentiate the soap from 
competitors by convincing doctors and dermatologists to recommend it. With the 
addition of a Neutrogena hair care line in 1980, the company enjoyed several 
years of rapid growth and profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales have continued to rise and reached $282 million for the fiscal year 
ended Oct. 31. Neutrogena's profit, however, plunged in 1990 as competition 
increased. Profit has since bounced back, but Neutrogena stock, which traded as 
high as $53 a share in 1987, has continued to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, one of the company's highly regarded executives, Allan Kurtzman, 
returned to Neutrogena as president and chief operating officer after helping 
turn around ailing cosmetics maker Max Factor. Max Factor was eventually sold 
to Procter & Gamble.

GREENSPAN HINTS STRONGLY OF RISE IN INTEREST RATES; ECONOMY: FED CHAIRMAN'S 
TESTIMONY BOOSTS ECONOMISTS' BELIEF THAT CENTRAL BANK WILL PUSH UP RATES AT 
MEETING NEXT WEEK. 
</P>

<P>
 Less than a week before a crucial Federal Reserve Board meeting, Chairman Alan 
Greenspan talked tough Wednesday about inflation. He said nothing to dispel 
economists' belief that the central bank is preparing to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reading between the lines, he is giving a strong hint he is on the verge of 
more tightening," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts think the Fed will raise interest rates for the fifth time this 
year when the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Greenspan's testimony before the House Government Operations 
subcommittee on monetary affairs focused on long-term issues, he also laid out 
a rationale for increasing interest rates even before any worsening in 
inflation is seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we see that final goods prices are beginning to accelerate, 
that's the result of policies put in place a year ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no alternative but to be forward-looking. The policies we are making 
today are really more relevant for 1995 than they are for 1994," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time that aggregate price indexes reveal the inflation is on the 
upswing, many imbalances that are costly to rectify have developed already," 
Greenspan said.  
</P>
<P>
 In a closely followed survey released Wednesday, 50 top private economists 
forecast inflation this year at 2.7%, the same as last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The private analysts surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, 
Ariz., predicted prices will rise 3.2% next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has sought to prevent inflation from accelerating by slowing economic 
growth with increases in short-term interest rates totaling 1.25 percentage 
points between February and May. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats in Congress have criticized the moves as premature, but 
financial market traders and economists in recent weeks have widely come to 
expect several more increases this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Department inflation reports due out this week will probably give Fed 
policy-makers the last bit of evidence they need to justify raising short-term 
interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at their meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists expect the reports to show 0.4% increases in both wholesale and 
consumer prices in July, which translate into about 5% at an annual rate, said 
economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will give them the support they need for the preemptive actions they are 
seeking," Dederick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan acknowledged to subcommittee members that dampening inflation may 
restrain employment growth in the short run, but he said the central bank's 
primary objective nevertheless is price stability. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, the increased economic efficiency fostered by low inflation 
will foster greater job growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our view is that as we move toward price stability," this sets "in motion 
forces which enhance all other aspects of the economy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On another topic, Greenspan said that "the list of shortcomings in U.S. 
economic data is depressingly long." 
</P>
<P>
 However, because the Fed does not rely on any one statistic and supplements 
its data with anecdotal evidence, the imprecision "does not pose a crippling 
hardship."

 Biotech Provisions Dropped from Health Reform Bill: House Majority Leader Rep. 
Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) has dropped a 15% Medicare rebate requirement for 
biotechnology companies from his health care reform bill, industry and 
congressional sources said.Gephardt has also scrapped a commission that would 
review drug prices to be used in the Medicare program, according to Rep. Anna 
Eshoo (D-Calif.). The biotech industry has strongly opposed the price 
commission and the rebate as price controls that would reduce capital 
investment in the industry and inhibit research.

 FTC, Schering Settle on Claims for Product: The Federal Trade Commission this 
week announced a consent agreement settling charges that Schering made false 
claims about the fiber content and weight-loss-promotion ability of Fibre 
Trim.The agreement follows a 1989 FTC administrative complaint regarding Fibre 
Trim advertisements. Schering will be prohibited from claiming that its food 
supplements aid weight loss unless clinical studies can substantiate the 
claims. "The company has not sold or promoted Fibre Trim since 1991, so the 
order has no impact on current sales," a Schering spokesman said. Schering is a 
subsidiary of pharmaceuticals maker Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J.

 Grape Farmers Sue San Francisco: The California Table Grape Commission says 
the city and county acted unlawfully when they discontinued selling California 
table grapes at Giants baseball games.In June, the Giants agreed to promote 
grapes during home games in exchange for a sponsorship fee. In July, at the 
direction of the city and county government, which owns Candlestick Park, 
grapes were pulled from the concession stands and the sponsorship agreement was 
terminated. The commission says the city's actions are based on a resolution 
passed in 1988 in support of the United Farm Workers boycott of California 
table grapes. The California Agricultural Relations Board has ruled that the 
UFW's secondary boycott is illegal.

 America West Airlines Plan OKd: The Phoenix-based carrier said its 
reorganization plan has been confirmed by a federal judge, clearing the way for 
the carrier to emerge from federal bankruptcy protection Aug. 23. Approval by 
Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert G. Mooreman came after most of the airline's 
unsecured creditors voted for the plan, in which a group led by Texas investor 
David Bonderman will provide the airline with $214 million in exchange for 
33.5% of its stock. America West filed for protection from creditors under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June, 1991.

 FCC Authorizes Impounding of 800 Numbers: AT&T Corp. said the Federal 
Communications Commission has given it authority to impound the numbers when 
callers are billed illegally. AT&T said the move steps up pressure on 
companies, particularly those offering adult entertainment, to protect the 
integrity of toll-free 800 numbers and eliminate unauthorized bills to the 
phone number where the call originated.Some services pay for the call to the 
800 number but collect for the service by tracing the call to its origination 
and billing that number, whether it's the caller's home or a public place, such 
as a hotel or school. By impounding an improperly used 800 number, AT&T said, 
it stops the company from deriving any more revenue from the number.

U.S. GAS PRICES INCREASE 14% FROM MARCH, A HIGH FOR '94; ENERGY: EXPERTS BLAME 
STRIKE BY NIGERIAN OIL FIELD WORKERS. WEST COAST IS EXPECTED TO CATCH UP SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just as many drivers are heading for cooler ground, U.S. gasoline prices have 
hit their highest point of the year -- thanks to a post-July surge that has 
driven pump prices nearly 14% above the March level. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles area hasn't been hit as hard yet -- experiencing a 12% hike in 
the same period -- but industry experts expect West Coast prices to close the 
gap soon if both crude oil costs and summer driving demand remain high. 
</P>
<P>
 "The West Coast has been sluggish but could be expected to catch up if the 
crude oil prices are sustained and demand remains strong," said Trilby 
Lundberg, publisher of the Los Angeles-based Lundberg Letter, which tracks 
petroleum and consumer trends. Lundberg does not expect the most recent surge, 
more than 3 cents a gallon since late July, to drive away customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stronger consumer economy is absorbing these few pennies without 
difficulty," Lundberg said. "Prices are only about a nickel more than last 
year, and yet we're consuming more gasoline than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 For unleaded regular self-serve gasoline, the national average price bottomed 
out at $1.02 a gallon March 11, according to Lundberg. That rose to $1.17 in 
the latest Lundberg survey, taken Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the same gasoline rose from $1.09 in March to $1.22 in the 
latest survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Gasoline nationally is about 10 cents a gallon higher than during the same 
season last year, while Los Angeles prices are up less than 6 cents a gallon 
over last summer, said Lundberg, who tabulates prices from 10,000 service 
stations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts blame the current higher prices on several factors beyond the 
summer driving season. 
</P>
<P>
 Many see at least some upward push from a protracted strike by more than 
200,000 Nigerian oil field workers that has boosted crude oil prices. By some 
estimates, Nigerian crude production -- which made up almost 8% of U.S. crude 
imports earlier this year -- has dropped by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gasoline is rising because of the partial disruption of Nigeria's exports," 
Nauman Barakat, vice president of futures trading at Merrill Lynch, told 
Reuters. "Nigerian crude is heavily in demand during the gasoline season." 
</P>
<P>
 But West Coast refiners, which are not dependent on Nigerian crude, say prices 
are only now catching up with generally higher crude oil prices throughout the 
year. Crude oil has risen nearly $5 a barrel since March, to about $19 a 
barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a glut of gasoline on the West Coast kept retail prices low, 
squeezing refiners' profit margins. To remedy that, and to revamp refineries 
for production of mandated cleaner-burning gasolines, refiners have recently 
cut back production, adding to the upward pressure on pump prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an element of truth to both" explanations, said William J. Sanderson, 
senior principal at the Long Beach office of Purvin & Gertz Inc., a refining 
consulting firm.

TALKS ON BLUE CROSS CHARITIES COME UNDER FIRE; INSURANCE: CLOSED MEETINGS ARE 
AT ISSUE. CONSUMER ADVOCATES ARE TOLD TO WRITE A LETTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A consumer group has sharply criticized a state agency's supervision of a Blue 
Cross of California plan to distribute more than $2 billion in charitable funds 
to health care organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue involves talks between the California Department of Corporations and 
Blue Cross about the insurer's charitable responsibilities since nonprofit Blue 
Cross spun off most of its private operations into a for-profit subsidiary, 
WellPoint Health Networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine, Wednesday accused 
the Department of Corporations of "secret negotiations" with Blue Cross. It 
asked Corporations Commissioner Gary Mendoza to hold public meetings and 
provide more information about the discussions with Blue Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union officials said they asked to meet personally with Mendoza to 
discuss their concerns about the Blue Cross plan but were told that such a 
meeting could jeopardize negotiations with the insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a general matter, I don't think it's helpful to negotiate through the 
media," Mendoza said. He said he asked the consumer group to submit its 
concerns in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "These negotiations are about $2.5 billion in public funds, and that's a lot 
of money," said Maryann O'Sullivan, an attorney at Consumers Union's office in 
San Francisco. "The idea of (Mendoza) saying, 'I don't want to meet with you 
because it might jeopardize sensitive negotiations with Blue Cross' -- I don't 
understand that from a public official." 
</P>
<P>
 After Blue Cross decided to form the WellPoint subsidiary, the state opened 
talks with the insurer about its charitable payments. In exchange for its 
tax-exempt status, Blue Cross is required to make charitable contributions to 
public groups in an amount equal to the value of the assets that were converted 
to for-profit status. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Wednesday's stock prices, the 80% of WellPoint that Blue Cross owns 
is worth roughly $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has been pressuring Blue Cross to increase its charitable giving. In 
May, Blue Cross said it would donate $100 million this year to health care 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sept. 15, Blue Cross is supposed to submit to the state a plan for meeting 
its future charitable obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union said Mendoza should make public the criteria by which it will 
evaluate the Blue Cross plan. It also asked that future meetings between Blue 
Cross and the Department of Corporations be open to the public and that public 
hearings be held after the plan is submitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said the state is protecting the public's interest in its negotiations 
with Blue Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't judge my performance based on how I'm being praised or criticized by 
any public interest group," he said. "I think our department will be judged by 
our results."

SEEKING SEPARATE BUYERS, KODAK REOPENS BIDDING FOR L&F PRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eastman Kodak Co. is reopening bidding for its L&F Products as it seeks 
separate buyers -- and a higher price -- for the unit's two businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said May 3 that it planned to sell L&F and two other units, 
Sterling Winthrop and Clinical Diagnostics, to reduce debt and concentrate on 
its core imaging business. 
</P>
<P>
 L&F now plans to sell its household products business and do-it-yourself 
business separately, L&F President and Chief Executive Michael Gallagher told 
employees in a memo Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire unit was expected to fetch $1.7 billion to $2 billion, analysts 
said. If L&F is split, the household products business will probably sell for 
more than the do-it-yourself side, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a lot of sense," said Nicholas Heymann of NatWest Securities. "Most 
likely any one single buyer would have subsequently turned around and sold the 
other part. Very few companies focus on both." 
</P>
<P>
 The household group's products include Lysol disinfectants, Resolve carpet 
cleaner, Olgivie hair care products, the Tussy makeup line and De-Con rat bait. 
It generated an estimated 60% of L&F's 1993 revenue of about $1.14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The do-it-yourself business is chemical- and paint-related, with brands 
including Thompson's water sealant, Formby's furniture refinisher, Minwax 
furniture refinisher and Red Devil enamel. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal memo said splitting the two businesses will link them closer to 
their industries. Howard Mead, an L&F spokesman, said selling the company in 
two parts "is the best way to maximize shareholder value for Kodak." 
</P>
<P>
 Mead said Kodak executives decided Tuesday night to pursue two buyers in an 
effort to boost the sale price. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thinking is that people are generally willing to pay more for something 
that's of more strategic interest to them," he said.

 AT&T to Take Charge for Eo Closure: The nation's largest provider of 
telecommunications services will take a $50- to $80-million third-quarter 
charge to shut the doors of its once-heralded Eo Inc. unit. Late last month, 
AT&T pulled the plug on the pioneering maker of personal communicators because 
of an inability to raise new capital.The charges will take no more than 2 cents 
to 4 cents a share off the company's earnings for the year, not enough to 
affect the company's ability to meet its earnings targets, spokesman Kevin 
Compton said. Eo's devices, tiny hand-held machines that combine fax, phone, 
pager and computer capabilities, were among the first of their kind to be 
introduced on the computer market, but they quickly disappointed users because 
the price was high and they were hard to use.

 Peoples Telephone Posts Loss, Loan Default: The nation's largest public pay 
phone company reported a loss of $4.9 million on revenue of $42.6 million for 
the quarter ended June 30, contrasted with a profit of $1.4 million on revenue 
of $30.1 million a year ago.Peoples also incurred costs in failed merger talks 
with IDB Communications Group, which has since agreed to be acquired by LDDS 
Communications. As a result of the losses, Peoples said it has defaulted on its 
$125-million credit facility, which has an outstanding balance of $97 million. 
The Miami company is working with its banks to cure the default.

 American Home Sues Cyanamid, Lines Up Financing: American Home Products Corp. 
is accusing American Cyanamid of depriving shareholders by ignoring American 
Home's $8.5-billion tender offer, and said it has the backing of a unit of 
Chemical Bank to finance the deal. The suit asks the U.S. District Court in 
Portland, Me., to block Cyanamid from seeking protection under the 
anti-takeover laws of Maine, where Cyanamid is incorporated. It also seeks to 
strike anti-takeover defenses from American Cyanamid's charter.

TOYOTA TO SHIFT SITE OF TRUCK PRODUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toyota Motor Corp. said Wednesday that it will shift production of all its 
compact pickup trucks sold in the United States to its assembly plant in 
Northern California, raising the possibility of additional jobs at the Fremont 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Toyota built 116,000 compact trucks at the Fremont plant and 
imported another 66,000 from Japan, Toyota spokeswoman Nancy Hubble said.But no 
decisions will be made on hiring additional workers until new production levels 
for the plant are determined, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota has been considering the shift in production for several months. 
Japanese auto firms have been moving more and more production to this country 
as the dollar's fall against the yen makes Japanese goods more expensive here. 
In addition, imported trucks have been slapped with a 25% tax for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The production shift will begin in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. plant in Fremont, jointly owned by 
Toyota and General Motors Corp., makes the Toyota Corolla and Geo Prizm cars in 
addition to the compact trucks. The facility employs 4,250. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional production would create more jobs. However, it wasn't clear whether 
some auto production will be moved elsewhere to accommodate the truck increase 
or whether the plant will be expanded.

SHANGHAI MARKET SURGES AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shanghai's Class A share market for domestic investors recorded another 
dazzling gain Wednesday, shrugging off Tuesday's losses to soar on expectations 
of an infusion of bank liquidity, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The index jumped 19.76%, adding 125.28 points to close at 759.17, and brokers 
said the surge will continue with new investors flooding into the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnover was $1.12 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers said the surge was partly triggered by excitement over a newspaper 
report offering details of a proposal, unveiled as part of a rescue package for 
the stock markets earlier this month, to pump credit into Chinese brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confidence was very strong," said Yan Yunlong, a broker with Shanghai 
International Securities, who predicted the index is headed for the 800-point 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang Lai, an International Securities analyst, said a powerful technical 
correction that dragged the index down by 13.11% on Tuesday was checked in the 
morning as investors moved in from the sidelines.

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; RENTAL CAR FEES MIGHT RISE 10%-15% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 10% to 15% increase in car rental costs is expected to push 1995 business 
travel costs up 2%, according to a study by Runzheimer International. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase would still be below the 2.7% inflation rate that is projected 
for next year, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 The expected jump in car rental costs won't offset inventory costs, which have 
surged more than 60% over two years, the consulting firm's travel division 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The auto companies are requiring the rental fleets to keep cars longer, both 
in terms of time and mileage," said Rolfe Shellenberger, senior consultant in 
travel management. 
</P>
<P>
 Air fare costs for business travel are expected to decline 1.5% next year as 
competitive pressures hold back increases for short-haul travel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lodging costs are expected to rise 3% next year as corporations try to keep 
costs down and high-priced hotels face competitive pressures of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of meals isn't expected to change, despite the Internal Revenue 
Service's move to reduce the tax deductibility of such meals.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; CHINA, PARTNERS HAVE A VISION OF PARADISE FOR HAINAN 
PROVINCE; ASIA: THE ISLAND'S IDEAL LOCATION IS SEEN AS ATTRACTING TOURISTS FROM 
NEARBY COUNTRIES WITH BOOMING ECONOMIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China, with considerable cooperation from international leisure firms looking 
for new markets to exploit, may be well on its way to turning its southern 
island province of Hainan into another Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by special tax incentives, Club Med Inc. is building a resort in Sanya 
on the southern edge of Hainan -- a tropical island on the same latitude as 
Hawaii's Kauai island. (The Chinese province is just east of Vietnam, across 
the Gulf of Tonkin.) 
</P>
<P>
 And on Tuesday, MGM Grand Inc. said it signed a memorandum of understanding 
with the provincial government giving it exclusive rights for six months to 
negotiate to build two large resorts on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Hainan is the largest of several economic development zones that the Chinese 
government has designated to attract foreign investment. Hainan, whose 
traditional industries have included agriculture, fishing and forestry, 
received its status in 1988 as part of a plan to draw the foreign development 
capital necessary to turn the lush island into an international tourist haven. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great hunger on the part of the Chinese government and the Chinese 
people to enjoy many of the same gaming and recreational activities we have 
come to take for granted in the U.S." said Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with the 
Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hainan's greater appeal to foreign companies is its proximity to 
other Asian countries with booming economies and a growing number of affluent 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Yemenidjian, vice president and chief financial officer of Las 
Vegas-based MGM Grand, said Hainan's "second to none" location makes it a 
logical site for expansion in the tourism market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is 45 minutes away from Hong Kong, within a two-hour flight from Indonesia 
and Malaysia, and a four-hour flight from Tokyo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That should make the Hainan sites appealing to the "high net worth" tourists 
MGM Grand hopes to lure from all over Asia, Logsdon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big trip to come to the U.S. from Korea or Japan," he said. "But if 
they can get to a resort on a three-hour flight, (American companies) could 
build up a lot more business." 
</P>
<P>
 If MGM Grand succeeds in getting a definitive agreement, many developers may 
flock to the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Walt Disney Co. has contemplated building a theme park or resort in 
southern China and has reportedly made deals for land in Sanya, said David 
Tsai, a Los Angeles businessman active in brokering deals in Hainan. A Disney 
spokesman in Burbank said it is company policy to neither confirm nor deny 
"rumors" of possible expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM said it envisions building an upscale beach resort in Sanya with tennis, 
swimming and boating facilities. Another hotel is planned for Haikou, the 
provincial capital, and may include a theme park, a bowling center and other 
recreational facilities, said Robert Maxey, president of MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Club Med announced in 1993 that it would build a 700-room 
resort near Sanya complete with restaurants, a theater, a marina, convention 
facilities, a golf course and a casino. That project is a joint venture with 
Sanya Luhuoltu Area Development Corp., a subsidiary of one of China's largest 
financial corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Club Med will target upscale tourists from Japan, Australia and New Zealand, 
said Edwina Arnold, a spokeswoman for the company in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Club Med already operates resorts in Bali, Thailand, Malaysia and Japan, and 
about two-thirds of Club Med's visitors to those resorts are from Asia, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important is the Chinese government's willingness to allow gambling in 
a country where it has been officially banned since the 1949 Communist 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems China has become much more (relaxed about) their historical and 
political ways in the past year," said Andrew Zarnett, an analyst with Ferman 
Selz in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM Grand and Club Med both plan to offer traditional casino games, but only 
to their non-Chinese clientele under current Chinese law. The details are yet 
to be worked out, but Yemenidjian said he believes Chinese nationals can play 
slot machines in certain areas as long as the payout is in tokens, not cash. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract investment, Hainan made significant investments in infrastructure, 
building new roads to major cities and an airport in Sanya, Yemenidjian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be surprised if other parts of China begin to try to develop their 
economies by encouraging foreign companies to come in and build destination 
resorts," he said.

 Counterfeiting on the Rise in Russia: Moscow is awash in counterfeit money, 
much of it cranked out on increasingly sophisticated photocopiers, police 
say."At the roughest estimate, at least 400 million in fake ruble notes (about 
$200,000) are circulating in Moscow," said Yevgeny Tumanov, head of the police 
economic crimes department. Across Russia, $6,000 in counterfeit rubles were 
tracked in just one day this week, the Interior Ministry said. Counterfeiting 
has blossomed since high-quality copiers became available in Russia in recent 
years, and the paper used by counterfeiters is sometimes indistinguishable from 
the real thing, Tumanov said.

 U.S. Imposes Ban on Taiwan Wildlife: The import ban on fish and wildlife 
products, established because of the country's failure to halt trafficking in 
tiger bones and rhino horns, will go into effect Aug. 19. Heavy demand for the 
tiger and rhino parts in Asia -- where they are used for reputed medical and 
sexual benefits -- has resulted in the virtual extinction of the animals. The 
U.S. sanctions -- the first time the United States has imposed trade penalties 
for environmental reasons -- will affect about $25 million a year in imports of 
coral and mollusk shell jewelry, snake, lizard and crocodile skin shoes and 
other leather goods.

PLAN FOR REVAMPING AMERICA WEST EARNS WINGS IN BANKRUPTCY COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal bankruptcy judge approved the reorganization plan of America West 
Airlines Inc. on Wednesday, clearing the way for the carrier to leave Chapter 
11 protection later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision eliminates almost $400 million in debt and ends three years of 
bankruptcy proceedings for the Phoenix-based airline. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization gives control of America West to a group led by David 
Bonderman, a Texas financier who brought Continental Airlines Inc. out of 
bankruptcy in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan approved by Judge Robert G. Mooreman, Bonderman's group -- 
which includes Continental, Mesa Airlines Inc. and the money management firm 
Fidelity Investments -- will provide America West with up to $245 million in 
exchange for 33.5% of the company's new common stock and control of nine of its 
15 board seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remaining stock, 59.5% will go to America West's unsecured creditors, 
5% will go to current shareholders and 2% will go to GPA Group, which leases 
aircraft to America West. 
</P>
<P>
 America West Chairman William Franke, speaking to reporters outside the 
courthouse, predicted the company will emerge from bankruptcy protection Aug. 
23 with about $300 million in available cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Mooreman's confirmation came after virtually all creditor opposition to the 
plan had been resolved earlier in the day. Creditors representing 95.2% of the 
unsecured claims and 91.3% of the common shareholders supported the 
reorganization proposal, the airline said.

THE GLAMOROUS LIFE: IT ONLY LOOKS EXPENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Debra Gendel, Times Fashion Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harper's Bazaar was a bit premature when, in the fall of 1992, it invited 
readers to "Enter the Era of Elegance." What the magazine should have said was 
"Enter the Era of Grunge, Psychedelia and Hip-Hop." 
</P>
<P>
 There would be two more funky years in fashion's May-December love affair with 
the street, during which even the aristocratic Karl Lagerfeld evinced a 
weakness for rappers. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the era of elegance really has dawned. Not because a magazine 
editor said so. But because -- to paraphrase art historian Anne Hollander -- 
our collective impulse to look elegant is coinciding with the production of 
elegant designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Blass said he detected a shift in the winds of fashion when former First 
Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died and magazines were filled with tributes to 
her sense of style: "The fact that there was such a response tells me 
something." Blass and Oscar de la Renta, another designer of ladylike fashion, 
have rung up record-breaking sales during recent trunk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Blass and De la Renta have always claimed a loyal following among 
women of a certain age, it's the younger women who seem most excited about 
dressing up. Trendsetter Sofia Coppola appeared at a charity affair in pretty 
pumps and silk charmeuse. Actress Nicole Kidman has reportedly signed contracts 
with agency makeup, hair and wardrobe people to polish her off-screen image. 
Sixteen-year-old runway models are learning to walk in four-inch heels. The 
Wonderbra is as indispensable as a Filofax. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the cloud in fall's silver lining: This is not an easy 
elegance. Exacting might be a better word -- with well-defined waistlines, 
perfectly applied red lipstick, matching polish and shiny, emphatic hair. 
Indeed, there's something aggressively feminine about the new (old) glamour, 
captured provocatively in photographer Steven Meisel's black-and-white ad 
campaign for Anne Klein. The photos telegraph the allure of the hard-edged 
woman -- a type not seen since flowery rayon dresses became the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 What's nice about artifice, of course, is that a woman needn't be a natural 
beauty to play the game. (Ask any transvestite.) Deftly applied eyeliner and, 
as Geoffrey Beene said recently, a well-cut double-faced wool jacket, give hope 
to us all. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman needn't be an heiress, either, to incorporate fall's dominant trends 
into her wardrobe. Kmart has a full supply of kilts, while several of the 
junior clothing chains have whipped out low-cost versions of the mohair 
sweaters, vinyl skirts and itty-bitty suits seen on every designer's runway 
last spring.  
</P>
<P>
 And in some cases, low cost means lighter-weight fabrics -- an advantage 
during the scorching months that Californians call fall.

BY DESIGN; OFF THE CUFF; A NIP AND A TUX GETS THE WEARER IN FORMAL SHAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether you think it's a comical monkey-suit or the most stylish of evening 
wear, there's no doubt the tuxedo is a foundation of high fashion. Jeanne 
Gibson sees it that way; she and her husband, Mike, own Gingiss Formalwear 
stores in the Mission Viejo Mall, South Coast Plaza and Westminster Mall.  
</P>
<P>
 A former high school teacher, Gibson gave up textbooks and test papers for 
thousands of rental tuxes, cummerbunds and shoes.  
</P>
<P>
 All are up-to-date styles -- there's not a ruffled shirt, powder blue coat 
with wide lapels or polyester flare pants in the mix. But Gibson says she still 
gets requests for "those things that would now make most people gag."  
</P>
<P>
 This is another in a series of first-person columns that allows people 
connected to the fashion industry to talk about their encounters.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When wearing a tux, men are going to an occasion that dictates behavior that's 
pretty conforming, so generally they are very careful with our rented tuxes. 
But some tuxes do take a beating. Men go swimming in them at the beach or they 
get thrown in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuxes have been ripped up in fights, stolen out of cars and thrown up on. 
Everything that can happen has happened to our tuxes. But they clean up awfully 
well because we buy good quality. 
</P>
<P>
 We had one wedding party where four of the ushers rolled around in ice plant. 
Now that's a stain that's difficult to get out. It came out of the wool tuxes, 
but never out of the shirts or accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't charge extra for damage unless it's malicious. If someone gets into a 
fight and completely destroys the tux, you bet I will charge him. But if a coat 
sleeve gets caught in the door and rips, it wasn't anyone's fault. Life 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest problems I see is a customer who calls or mails in his 
"wish measurements" instead of his real measurements. Maybe those numbers were 
apropos when he was working out regularly or when he was younger, before things 
shifted. 
</P>
<P>
 When he comes in to try the tux on, he may say that we didn't give him the 
right size. That's OK. Our stock is all in the back -- we probably have 1,500 
coats and 3,000 pairs of pants -- so we just go and get the size that will fit. 
It may be four or five sizes bigger, but we'll make him happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Having our stock on the premises really helps. We had a wedding party come in 
here that originally went to another store, one that orders its tuxes from a 
catalogue. They ordered black tuxes but when they went to pick them up on 
Saturday morning for the wedding that afternoon, the tuxes were purple because 
the salesperson wrote down the wrong color code. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridesmaids' dresses were burgundy. Ugh! That store couldn't get the new 
tuxes in time, so everybody came running over here and we outfitted them on the 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who are attending a special event sometimes rent tuxes rather than buy a 
dress. We've even done an entire wedding where the men and women wore matching 
tuxes. Since tux coats and pants come in all sizes, we can fit anyone. The 
rental price is the same for men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 When a man is going to wear a tux three times a year, it becomes cost 
efficient for him to buy one. There are probably two or three other times he 
would wear a tux that year if it were in his closet. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem with a high school student is his prom date. A girl comes 
in with her boyfriend to pick out accessories, then she finds out that her 
girlfriend has changed the color of her dress so she changes her colors and her 
date has to change his. Some tickets have so many changes on them that we have 
to start over. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school boys look like the "Wreck of the Hesperus" when they come in 
here, but they clean up really well.

BY DESIGN; A CUT ABOVE; TO NASRIN ANSARI, QUALITY IS EVERYTHING. THAT'S CLEAR 
IN HER ATTENTION TO DETAIL: HAND-SEWN BUTTONHOLES, LUSCIOUS FABRICS AND LENGTHY 
FITTINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The vividly colored sketches posted in Nasrin Ansari's studio belie her words: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not an artist," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this studio, near the Lido Marina Village in Newport Beach, attention 
goes not to the generic figures, but to the elaborately detailed outfits in 
which they are clothed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tear sheets from fashion magazines hang on wires she's stretched along a 
marked-up wall. The markings were placed to look like an abstract clothing 
pattern, complete with notation and dart lines. A drafting table serves as her 
work station; nearby a cabinet on wheels stores her pens, ink bottles and other 
art tools. 
</P>
<P>
 On shelves in the minimalist foyer sit bolts of fabrics: beaded laces, silk 
brocades and crinkled crepes. Beyond the narrow area is a patio where Ansari 
meets with her clients and, to the right, a workroom filled with seamstress 
tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansari, 42, says her dedication to fashion is more as an art form than just 
making clothes. Even when she talks about her favorite designer, Valentino, she 
refers to his art. "Few designers now value their work, the quality. Not even 
the house of Chanel is concerned with the art of fashion anymore," she laments. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansari's talent is revealed in what cannot be seen. Darts on a lace bodice are 
snipped and hand-sewn for a seamless effect. A blouse is lined in such a way 
that the rough edges are out of sight; it can almost be worn inside out. Beaded 
details and buttonholes are usually hand-stitched. A sleeve can take three days 
to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Couture demands exacting stitches. I'm trying to give people quality," says 
Ansari, her accent laced with traces of Farsi, Turkish and French, all of which 
she speaks fluently, in addition to English. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can make much more money by rushing, but for me quality is everything. I'd 
rather lose an order and the money than sacrifice the quality of other orders," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 To Ansari, quality control means spending as much time with her clients as 
necessary. First appointments are spent finding out exactly what they want; at 
the next meeting Ansari offers anywhere from 10 to 20 sketches for an outfit, 
along with fabric suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabric, more than design, can make or break the overall effect, she says. 
"When I feel fabric," Ansari says, "I can tell if (an outfit is) going to come 
out perfectly. I think good work has to go with good fabric." 
</P>
<P>
 She says almost two decades spent working in Paris allowed her to build 
relationships with the same fabric manufacturers that supply signature 
materials for Versace, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy and Valentino. 
</P>
<P>
 Specialty fabrics can cost as much as $200 to $500 per yard; the lining alone 
can cost $35 per yard. A beaded fastener can cost $65. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansari's signature special-order pieces can run anywhere from $300 to $1,800, 
depending on the fabric and details. An evening gown can cost $1,600 to $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients have brought back bolts from their travels to Paris or Milan. Or they 
have gone with Ansari to her sources to shop for the right yardage. She 
welcomes any involvement that makes her clients more comfortable with their 
orders -- even if it takes three hours for a fitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more important for me to be the favorite (designer) in their closet," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year and a half and dozens of outfits, client Mary Anne Emett no 
longer feels the need to go on fabric excursions with Ansari. "I really trust 
her with the fabric buying. I've seen what she likes and I've bought a lot of 
it," says the Balboa resident, who, at 6 feet, 2 inches, considers Ansari a 
godsend for dressing her in a "drop-dead gorgeous" wardrobe that includes 
lingerie and travel wear. "I'll see a fabric I like, but it won't work with a 
particular design. She knows how I like to look, so she keeps me from going 
astray." 
</P>
<P>
 Ansari attributes her appreciation for the finer aspects of fashion to the 
years she lived in Paris. Her parents, impressed by her talent, moved the 
family from Iran to France when she was 14 and enrolled her in design school. 
Three years later, she entered the Jeoffrin Byrs International Fashion School, 
where she studied for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The French are not obsessed with designer labels. Quality is more important 
to them than the name," Ansari says. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon graduation from Byrs, she went to work as a pattern maker for Cote 
D'Azur, a women's daywear label based in southern France. Then in 1982, she and 
her children immigrated to California and she was hired to start a women's wear 
division for Dansha, a Los Angeles menswear label. When the company moved to 
Taiwan three years later, she turned to free-lance work, designing fabric 
prints and ready-to-wear collections for St. Tropez in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Business is very (good), so why not start doing this for myself?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She moved the family to Laguna Niguel in 1989 and cultivated a clientele from 
her in-house studio -- which included the living room frequently doubling as a 
showroom. She also began contributing fashion articles to an Orange 
County-based Iranian language newspaper, Payam-e Ashena. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, Ansari learned about Orange County's concept of fashion and 
haute couture. She found society mavens craving clothes that were as well-made 
as their price tag implied. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Ansari: "Everyone complains about what's out there: the fit, the quality, 
the conformity. They don't want to all look the same. If you're spending 
$10,000 on a dress, you want to look unique." 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes that by fall, 1995, she will have transformed the foyer of the 
studio she opened in 1993 into a mini-boutique filled with her first 
ready-to-wear collection. Eventually she wants to open a string of signature 
boutiques, but says she will not get into mass production. "I prefer to test my 
designs personally to maintain the quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers often ask why she doesn't leave Orange County for New York. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the weather and her teen-age children. But Ansari also believes she 
can make a name from California. "Richard Tyler did it" in Los Angeles, she 
says. "New York doesn't need one more designer. People need me here."

 When Lisa Motz rings up a bottle of Mane 'N Tail at Dominion Saddlery at the 
Los Angeles Equestrian Center, she can't resist asking: 
</P>
<P>
 "For you or your horse?" 
</P>
<P>
 Detouring to a tack store for shampoo has become a quirky trend, practiced 
even by those who don't know a knee from a hock (hind knee). While there, some 
also pick up Hoof-Alive conditioner, saying it does wonders for cuticles and 
nails. 
</P>
<P>
 About eight of 10 customers buy horse grooming products for themselves, says 
Motz, who uses Mane 'N Tail on her own shiny, dark blond tresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, by popular demand, equine beauty products are showing up in drug, 
discount and grocery stores. Manufacturers are repackaging, relabeling and 
relaunching their goods for a mass market. 
</P>
<P>
 Straight Arrow Products, the Pennsylvania-based manufacturer of Mane 'N Tail, 
has sold horse-grooming aids since 1971. About three years ago, its market 
research revealed that customers were using the products on themselves, says 
Gene Carter, executive vice president of sales and marketing. So the company 
repackaged some items and added to the line -- which includes shampoos, hair 
spray, styling mousse, perm enhancer and other options -- for sale in drug and 
discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Western Thoroughbred shampoo and conditioner were meant strictly for horse 
hair. But about six months ago, retailers began requesting the products, says 
Steven Estrin, national retail sales manager for General Therapeutics in 
Hempstead, N.Y. Now, the products are in 1,500 retail stores, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Conair Corp. of Stamford, Conn., skipped the horse track altogether and 
launched its Magical Mane shampoo and conditioner directly to drug, discount 
and grocery stores in March. To develop the formula, the company evaluated 
horse-grooming products, marketing manager Neil Guller says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of equine beauty products for human use are expected to top $80 million 
this year, industry sources say. Prices are comparable to other drugstore 
offerings. Old Western Thoroughbred shampoo, for instance, is about $4.99 for 
16 ounces; Magical Mane, $4.99 for 32 ounces; Mane 'N Tail's Conceived by 
Nature shampoo, $4.99 for 16 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the draw? Results, pure and simple, manufacturers say. Anything that 
works on coarse horse hair, the logic goes, is bound to work wonders on even 
the worst of human hair. Still, the horse and conventional shampoos share some 
primary ingredients. Both often include the moisturizer panthenol and sodium 
lauryl sulfate, a foaming cleansing agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Before switching from a horse market to a human one, manufacturers must vouch 
for their products' safety, says Brad Stone, spokesman for the Food and Drug 
Administration. That is generally done by testing or by using ingredients that 
are established as safe, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a handful of complaints" about the horse-grooming products, Stone 
says, citing scalp irritations or rashes. Most likely, says Janine Loosley, an 
FDA chemist, those side effects are the result of the higher concentration of 
cleansing agents often found in horse-grooming products. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the fad of borrowing from the animal world will be short-lived. But 
Conair is investigating whether dog- and cat-grooming aids might be adapted for 
human use, Guller says. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Gregory, who sells his Hoof-Alive dressing in large tins to tack stores, 
is planning to launch a repackaged version to drug and discount stores later 
this summer. ("The Cadillac of hoof conditioners," he boasts.) To please his 
two-legged customers, he's already introduced a three-quarter-ounce, purse-size 
Hoof-Alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case those hoofs, er nails , need oiling. 
</P>
<P>
 * For information on availability, call Old Western Thoroughbred, (800) 
645-3752; Straight Arrow, (800) 251-7875; Hoof-Alive, (800) 526-2999; Conair 
Corp., (800) 726-6247.

OLD WEST GIVES WAY TO FAR EAST AT PLAYTIME; CHILDHOOD: KIDS TODAY KNOW NOTHING 
OF ROPIN' AND RIDIN' AND TWIRLING TOY SIX-GUNS. THEY ARE BEING NINJA-IZED WHILE 
THE COWBOY FADES INTO HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Among Robert James Waller's pretensions is the belief that he represents "the 
last of the cowboys." That doesn't mean he's the only fellow left ropin' dogies 
and sleeping under the stars; it is hard to believe that this former 
business-school dean did much cowpunching at any time of his life, let alone 
since "The Bridges of Madison County" was published and he's made a ton of 
money. No pork and beans heated in a No. 10 can for this buckaroo's dinner, we 
can be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, what Waller tells interviewers is that as the last cowboy, he still 
believes in rugged individualism and the ramblin' life. It's a comforting 
image, I guess. But I'm not worried about preserving individualism. It's the 
cowboys I'm thinking about. 
</P>
<P>
 For the cowboy culture is fading fast. You may hear every so often about how 
the release of two Westerns simultaneously represents a comeback for the cowboy 
movie, or that cowboy boots or hats are back in fashion. But where this most 
American of phenomena needs to be strongest -- among the young -- the cowboy 
has become another historical oddity. He has lost out to the ninja. 
</P>
<P>
 I have two boys, ages 7 and 4. In my generation -- in the late 1950s and early 
'60s -- they would have been prime cowboy candidates. They would have had the 
hats, the boots, the belts and, especially, the guns. They would have watched 
dozens of cowboy shows on TV and gone to Saturday matinees featuring cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 They would have learned about all aspects of cowboy culture. What a lariat is, 
and a box canyon. That no crime in the West was worse than cattle rustling, and 
that the bad guys always had unshaven faces and dark outfits, and sneered a 
lot. How to see if the man you shot is dead (you raise his hand; if it flops 
back to earth, he is). How -- and this is important -- to twirl a pistol on 
your index finger and then slip it back effortlessly into the holster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My kids know nothing of these important bits of lore. For they have been 
ninja-ized. They aren't watching "The Rifleman" or "Wagon Train" or Roy Rogers 
or Gene Autry. Rather, their frame of reference includes "Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers," "The Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles" and the "Three Ninja" movies. 
They have become experts in the Ninja Way. 
</P>
<P>
 They may not know what a Colt .45 was, but they sure are familiar with bo 
staffs, nunchakus, katana swords and other martial-arts weapons. I thought it 
was a great achievement to remember which Ninja Turtle wore which color 
headband (Donatello purple, Raphael red, Leonardo blue, Michelangelo orange). 
That took only a few months. But I could never recall who fought with which 
weapon until the younger boy, then 3, patiently walked me through the details. 
</P>
<P>
 I can remember when, as kids watching a TV show, we were impressed if a cowboy 
could flip his antagonist during a bar fight. That's small change now. My boys 
are experts at various kicks, rolls and spins, all accompanied with startling 
sound effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicky, the younger one, does a terrific approximation of the sound that katana 
swords make as they slash through the air (whuuup-whuuup-whuuup). I don't know 
of a single boy his age who can't scream "hi-yaaaah" as he leaps from the sofa 
toward his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt, my older boy, once asked if I could duplicate a side kick he had just 
executed. 
</P>
<P>
 I said I couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it because you're too old?" he asked, and he was not being unkind. He had 
heard that reason before. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I answered. I wasn't too old -- just not coordinated enough. 
</P>
<P>
 When we played cowboys, you never had to worry about being a martial-arts 
whiz. You didn't have to be some kind of aerobic wonder, leaping from one end 
of the room to the other. You merely had to know how to handle a six-gun and 
make good gun sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing an approximation of a gun being fired was tricky: You started with a 
hard, explosive "p" and then sort of whistled through your top teeth. Thus, you 
got not only the initial sound of gunfire but also the effect of a bullet 
traveling through the air and even, if you were good enough, the sound it might 
make upon hitting a boulder. (TV cowboys were always hitting boulders.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About two years ago, I promised Matt a gun and holster set, just like one his 
dad had as a child. Was I passing on part of my youth? Perpetuating a piece of 
beloved culture? Matt seemed mildly interested in getting his cowboy outfit -- 
what kid would pass up a new toy? -- but certainly his father was more excited 
about the whole thing than he was. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to three toy stores -- and none of them had a gun and holster set. They 
sold all sorts of toy police paraphernalia. High-powered Army hardware. Ninja 
outfits. Super Soakers that would douse half of Baltimore County. But good, 
old-fashioned cowboy gear? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 If Westerns come on TV these days, my boys usually watch them for a few 
minutes. But they get bored easily, and I understand why. Compared to the 
warp-speed goings-on in standard ninja fare, a cowboy show seems hopelessly out 
of date. There isn't much technology or flash, and everything moves so slowly. 
It's like playing Mortal Kombat at the video arcade and then trying to play one 
of those old Pong games, which were much less sophisticated and challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 So I've accepted that cowboy culture probably will never take hold with my 
kids, and they may never learn what a sidewinder is, or a greenhorn or a 
varmint. We do have to move on. But if cowboys finally do dwindle to that 
final, solitary one, please don't let it be a guy who writes sappy novels and 
gives his pickup truck names like George. Somehow I don't think that's what the 
Old West was all about.

FIRST PERSON: NOT THE WEDDING SHE'D IMAGINED, BUT . . .

 Glads knew I was about to elope before I did. 
</P>
<P>
 Prescient there was going to be a husband in the house and his top dog status 
would be undermined, the night before Douglas and I eloped a sad Glads, my 
cocker spaniel, went outside and vomited. 
</P>
<P>
 The bride-to-be wasn't sick in the yard, but I wasn't sleeping, either. In our 
case eloping didn't mean scrambling down a ladder on a moonlit night, but I 
didn't believe in sneaking off, tying the knot without family ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Others feel negatively toward elopement for a different reason: Weddings 
represent $32 billion in annual retail sales and the "power wedding," as 
Bride's magazine calls it, with the big floor show, is the going favorite. With 
no serious money required, elopement constitutes a definite loss to the 
national economy, especially since etiquette experts don't agree on whether 
elopers even deserve presents: Ann Landers says yes; Miss Manners, no. 
</P>
<P>
 So why had Douglas been dialing a stranger named Steve, a minister whose ad in 
the Yellow Pages read "Your place or mine"? 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, a favorite patient of Douglas' had died, a friend's daughter 
had also died and a friend my age had breast cancer. These tragedies hurled us 
to the realization that if something should happen, we'd be financially better 
off married. To our surprise, we would begin by talking taxes and end up 
courting ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of the last day of summer, the day we thought we might run off, 
while Douglas played phone tag with the minister, I walked down our front slope 
to clip roses for a bridal bouquet, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back up, I hosed a stubborn puddle of cocker spaniel vomit off the 
walkway. Was that any way to start off what might be my wedding day? Yes. Pink 
roses and dog regurgitation reflect life as it is: bliss and barf, barf and 
bliss. 
</P>
<P>
 Discarding the leaves from the roses, I stood at the kitchen sink, and saw 
myself: a 46-year-old woman arranging her own wedding flowers. Was it a mistake 
to not include my sister to help with the flowers and to hold my hand? 
Especially since she was the person who had first sensed what Douglas meant to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "How'd you know?" I'd asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because you gave him your garage door opener." 
</P>
<P>
 Something else needs explaining. Two years before, on the coattails of my 
sister's wedding in Aspen, Douglas had proposed and I'd accepted. We'd invited 
all our dearest friends, hired a caterer. At the last minute, when the 
guitarist asked about our song, we chickened out. 
</P>
<P>
 Not wanting to appear so foolish again, this time we were telling no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a sink full of roses, I found a piece of rubber tubing, the kind 
that protects pipes from chill, and fitted the stems inside. My winterized 
bridal bouquet was a talisman: The summer salad days of a marriage are easy; 
it's against the chilly winter days (for better or worse, richer or poorer, in 
sickness and in health), that newlyweds need protection. 
</P>
<P>
 When Douglas finally reached the minister, we had to scramble to make it to 
the church, or in our case, our local public park. 
</P>
<P>
 I changed quickly from my bathrobe into a white linen dress. (Looking at a 
photo taken that day, my brother-in-law, would say, "She knew she was getting 
married. Her dress was ironed.") Wearing an ordinary dress as my bridal gown 
was so unlike the younger version of myself, who, swept away by the Big First 
Wedding, had decked herself out in 19th-Century Victorian lace. 
</P>
<P>
 The minister provided one witness, his wife, Christine, who, to my 
disappointment, was wearing shorts and a T-shirt. Since we needed two 
witnesses, Christine approached a woman sunbathing on the grass. Smelling of 
coconut oil, she said, "Sure. I was married once too." 
</P>
<P>
 I expected Steve to usher us inside the privacy of a nearby gazebo. Instead, 
standing out in the open on a public sidewalk, in front of God and business 
people on their lunch hours, Steve turned to Douglas and me and, without any 
further to-do, opened a notebook and started reading a computer printout 
wedding ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve was only a mail-order minister (his decree arrived in the mail from 
Universal Life Church), and his wife was wearing short shorts, and our other 
witness was a barefoot sunbather, but midway through the 200-word ceremony, 
about the place where Steve asked, "Doug, do you pledge to tenderly care for 
Jo?" something holy happened, one of life's rare transcendental moments that is 
food for the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The photo Christine snapped captured the depth of emotion that took us by 
surprise: We are holding hands, Douglas, white-knuckled, his shock of white 
hair blowing in the breeze; me, clutching my winterized bouquet; every nerve 
ending alive, we were smiling and crying at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Touched by its accidental grace, I discovered elopement can be the Zen 
equivalent of distilling a private experience, extracting it down to its 
essence, and packing it with power. 
</P>
<P>
 For us, elopement became the ultimate power wedding.

IT ALL STARTED WITH THREE DAYS OF PEACE AND MUSIC; ROCK: ALTHOUGH NANCY NEVINS 
OF LAGUNA BEACH DIDN'T FIND LASTING FAME AT WOODSTOCK, HER LIFE SINCE HAS 
REFLECTED A GENERATION.

 That sweltering Friday afternoon, Richie Havens sang, the Swami Satchedenada 
chanted, and then Sweetwater dealt with the squawking, archaic sound system and 
cranked out a sweaty 45-minute show: We were the first rock group to play at 
Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 We were first to stumble innocently across the black cables scattered insanely 
around the makeshift stage, and first to struggle to maintain eye contact 
across the plywood expanse. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, clutching gear and instruments, we were first to struggle up and down 
the slippery green hill backstage, hoping to catch a helicopter. We were first 
to make our way back to real life after the helicopter ran out of gas and 
dumped us onto a tiny, deserted airport runway in the hot country blackness of 
Upstate New York. Whooping and partying, Woodstock revelers tramped by in the 
dark woods, while perplexed Sweetwater sweated it out that late Friday night, 
listening to the happy, anonymous voices. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally back at the motel, we were first to collapse from exhaustion, then 
first to return to L.A. to tell our friends and mothers about entertaining the 
great swaying pasture of glistening hippies, stunned under the sun and stars by 
the spontaneous, rainy apocalypse of Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 But does anybody remember us? 
</P>
<P>
 There were posters with our name on it. We received some press. We're even in 
books about Woodstock. We even created a modest scandal after our set when our 
flute player, Albert, battered the Holiday Inn entrance overhang by driving the 
U-Haul truck into it. 
</P>
<P>
 So does anybody remember us? 
</P>
<P>
 With preparations underway to celebrate Woodstock's 25th anniversary and rock 
acts being recruited from everywhere ('60s veterans and '90s stars alike), with 
tons of media coverage and the attendant philosophical debate about combining 
authentic Woodstock with elaborate hotel/airline packages and cellular phones 
on site, with all this and more, does anybody remember us?  
</P>
<P>
 Eyes glaze when challenged, "Sweetwater, three albums, Warner Bros. Reprise 
Records, remember?" Sometimes, the hippest (usually oldest) say, "Oh, 
you-guys-were-great. What happened?" 
</P>
<P>
 What happened indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer may be that most of us left after our set, forsaking the mud and 
the photo ops with other performers. Or maybe it was the forgettable sound 
system we tested for Hendrix, the Who and Joplin's fabulous shows to come. 
Maybe it was our management (actually called "Shady Management"), or maybe it 
was the temperament of Martin Scorcese, then editor of the "Woodstock" film, 
who left us on the cutting room floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we seemed too weird with seven eclectic instruments and no regular 
electric guitarist. After three technologically primitive '60s albums, maybe it 
was the missing, magical hit that defeated us. Maybe it was our jazz-rock 
vision, too fragile to survive the stormy, disco'd '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it was that drizzly December evening, four months after Woodstock, 
when a drunk driver made an accordion out of my Buick, leaving me, the lead 
singer, with one working vocal cord and petit mal seizures for the next 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Be it bad luck, the gods, whatever. The point, Woodstock, is that any group 
can come back when they've had a lot of hits. We want to come back because we 
belong to you. 
</P>
<P>
 We are you, Woodstock.  
</P>
<P>
 We survived. Well, some of us survived. Sweetwater has stood over the coffins 
of its drummer, its cellist, its flutist. And we've lost track of our 
sometimes-guitarist. But the rest of us still make music. 
</P>
<P>
 We survived aging, job loss and parents dying. We became teachers, builders, 
artists. When another band came along and used our name, we survived that too. 
Now we pay taxes, and we realize that the immortal feelings of 20-year-olds 
equal the illusions of the Establishment we once attacked so religiously. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes we shake our heads over really new music and we don't easily 
understand change like we used to, but we still dream, even though our own 
angry children sometimes call us foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 From Manson to Simpson, we survived the cultural mayhem: the gurus, the 
discos, the demise of vinyl LPs, the greed, the me-ism, the schemes of the 
'80s; screaming activists and presidential tomfoolery; acquiring and losing our 
fortunes; designer drugs; the New Age and our past lives; the movies, the 
issues, the wars, the guns-riots-floods-fires-earthquakes; the programs and the 
addictions of 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of everything, we made good on our baby boomer lives. Not always as 
we thought we should, but we did. We're still here believing in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 We create each day, although sometimes we creak a little. We have gray 
hair/thinning hair/no hair, and our waistlines have expanded. But like the best 
of our '60s dreams, we stayed the same while we grew, and as America approaches 
a new century, we will be her rock 'n' roll grandparents and 
great-grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 We are all Woodstock with our clashing lusts for parties, children, money, 
God, simplicity, sameness, newness, fashion and truth. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sweetwater, like classic hippie/boomers, would love to bring our hope, our 
new drummer and our new music to this August's celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 There's much to sing about. 
</P>
<P>
 We just don't want to go on first, OK? 
</P>

NEA FACES NEW CRISIS OVER FUNDING, GRANTS; THE ARTS: THE AGENCY'S DECISION TO 
DENY FUNDS TO THREE PHOTOGRAPHERS COMES AS SIGNIFICANT NEW CUTS IN ITS BUDGET 
ARE BEING SORTED OUT IN CONGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Congress hasn't even inked a new budget for the embattled National Endowment 
for the Arts, but already the war over federal arts funding is leaving 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the latest controversy may have been sparked by an attempt to 
avoid new problems for the agency while significant new cuts to the NEA budget 
are being sorted out in Congress. The latest incident happened Friday when the 
agency's National Council on the Arts overturned grants recommended by the NEA 
photography panels for three photographers, even though the council has 
historically approved the peer panel recommendations that come first. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, the rejected photographers included Andres Serrano, whose 1986 
photograph of a crucifix in urine, "Piss Christ," touched off an earlier round 
of censorship battles. Also overturned were fellowships to Merry Alpern of New 
York and Barbara DeGenevieve of Chicago, both of whose work involve sexual 
themes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council can't turn down grants for political reasons, according to the 
legislation that established the NEA, but the funding fracas before Congress 
was directly referred to in the panel's deliberations. In a public discussion 
before the vote, National Council member Barbara Grossman, a Tufts University 
theater professor, said: "We hear about the cuts across the board, programs 
having to slash. And I think that we cannot be blind to the political reality, 
either. And I would never, ever, ever limit an artist's ability to create. . . 
. But I think that given the volatile times in which we live, we cannot be 
myopic about the reality of funding either." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are trying to save (the NEA) by chopping off its extremities," Andy 
Grundberg, chairman of the photography fellowship advisory peer panel that 
recommended Serrano, said in an interview early this week. Grundberg, former 
New York Times photography critic, is now director of the Ansel Adams Center 
for Photography in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by phone Tuesday, Grossman denied the charge. "The budget battles are 
there . . . but I cannot say that that fact made me decide in a particular way. 
I judge the artwork as the artwork, and it was not a decision made on political 
grounds whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 The NEA's photography advisory panel is sending a letter of protest to NEA 
Chairman Jane Alexander, although she does not have the authority to overturn 
the council's decision. The protest comes as artists and arts organizations 
circle their wagons in the wake of the Senate's threat to slice 5% off the 
$171-million NEA budget. (The three programs that fund performance art and 
photography, the bane of the agency's conservative critics, are targeted for 
40% cuts -- visual arts, theater, and presenting and commissioning.)  
</P>
<P>
 The House had passed a 2% cut, and a compromise is expected to emerge soon 
from a House-Senate conference committee. The battle comes as private 
foundations are also cutting back funding in the wake of the '80s boom. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Odyssey Theatre production manager Jason Loewith launched a 
fax campaign to urge the theater community to write to their congressional 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you believe in the arts in this country, you MUST let your voice be heard 
NOW . . . ," Loewith said in the fax. 
</P>
<P>
 Other arts advocates are wearying of an ideological fray that only seems to 
deepen. 
</P>
<P>
 "My comment to the people at the NEA was that they should not be expecting 
this constituency to rise again in support of the NEA after what's just 
happened," said David Mendoza, executive director of the National Campaign for 
Freedom of Expression. "The questions from faxes and E-mail from that 
constituency is that's exactly what I'm hearing: Why bother?" 
</P>
<P>
 The current congressional budget furor was ignited by reports of a March 5 
performance by artist Ron Athey at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis that 
was supported by $150 in NEA money, a portion of a larger grant. In a work with 
roots in Antonin Artaud's "theater of cruelty," Athey carved a ritual pattern 
into the back of artist Darryl Carlton, blotted it with paper towels and hung 
them from a clothesline over the audience. Even though Athey says Carlton is 
not HIV-positive, an audience member complained about supposed health risks, 
and conservative religious groups seized on the ensuing press melee to complain 
to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed that it's happening now under Jane Alexander's tenure," said 
Adolfo V. Nodal, general manager of L.A.'s Cultural Affairs Department. "You 
would hope that at this point under the Clinton Administration, with Jane as a 
leader, that the leadership could be found to make sure we don't continue to 
demonize artists. Obviously, it's the same old game." 
</P>
<P>
 Arts organizations say the results could be devastating for the arts in L.A., 
which receives nearly $660,000 under the NEA's targeted programs, according to 
an NEA spokesman. "Anything short of annual inflation increases is disastrous," 
said performance artist and Highways co-founder Tim Miller.  
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that NEA grants, which tend to be small fractions of 
arts organizations' budgets, nonetheless have a ripple effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "NEA funds are critical in terms of leveraging other dollars" from private 
sources, said Helen Bruner, executive director of the National Assn. of 
Artists' Organizations. "It gives credibility and clout." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Senate's cuts go through, the Santa Monica Museum of Art would have to 
reduce artists fees; mount fewer shows and run them longer; include fewer 
artists in group shows; and scrap catalogues and brochures, according to 
executive director Thomas Rhoads. The museum earns $15,000 of its $450,000 
budget in NEA visual arts funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Baroque would have to consider raising ticket prices for readings if 
its $5,000 grant under the NEA's targeted presenting and commissioning program 
is slashed, director Tosh Berman said. The Venice literary-arts center has a 
budget of nearly $200,000.

DRAWING A SELLOUT CROWD WITH A RETURN TO '80S PUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past year, Dragonfly has been one of the most consistent barometers of 
the trends in Los Angeles' club scene. When it was cool to be spotted in a Bee 
Gees T-shirt and hip-hugging bell-bottoms dancing to disco, Wednesday's 
now-obsolete Superfly was your catwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's no surprise that the Hollywood club is on the cutting edge of Los 
Angeles' latest trend: the revival of early '80s punk. Tuesday night's punk 
club Sellout has become the room's biggest draw, bumping some of its leftover 
boogie nights into quasi-obscurity.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesdays you're apt to see steel-toed boots and dickeys, which is fitting 
considering the music lineup. Since the club opened three months ago, Sellout 
has featured raucous live performances by the Circle Jerks, the Vandals and 
Thelonious Monster -- joined by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who played a punk 
set. Chuck LaVallee and Trudy Truelove, the club's promoters, are also 
selectively booking the progeny of some of these acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellout is offering such good music right now that it has become a hangout for 
a number of the scene's artists -- the Peppers' Dave Navarro and Chad Smith and 
the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones are regulars. But true to punk's origins, 
Sellout's coolest draw is its unscheduled performances, which have included 
guest turns by Bad Religion and the original members of T.S.O.L. 
</P>

FAMILY; YOUNG ARTISTS GROW IN ROCK THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Theatrical "smoke" drifts over Soundstage 10 at Paramount Studios where 
performers pose immobile in silhouette. Abruptly, a wash of white light 
captures the figures in an eerie, hazy glow, music wells up and the cast, 
wielding 3-foot sticks with martial precision, explodes into a high-energy 
dance interpretation of Janet Jackson's R&B/pop hit "Rhythm Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The choreography is complex, the voices of soloist Nakaze (Nikee) Harris and 
an offstage chorus are mature and assured. Yet, although these talented 
performers may look a lot like show-biz pros, they aren't -- even though they 
did a gig in Whoopi Goldberg's "Sister Act 2," have performed at benefits with 
such pop luminaries as Kenny Loggins and Michael Bolton, represented the United 
States at the Universal World Expo '92 in Spain and are featured on an upcoming 
Christmas album from John Tesh's GTS Records. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the teen-age and twentyish members of Rock Theatre, a nonprofit, 
Valley-based, 14-year-old performance training program, and they are rehearsing 
an ambitious song-and-dance revue, "Rock Theatre in Concert." 
</P>
<P>
 The show, featuring music video-style pop-rock hits and Broadway tunes, opens 
Friday at Paramount for a weekend run through Sept. 11, in repertory with host 
California Youth Theatre's "Accent on Youth" monthlong performing arts event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show's subtitle is "Coming Out of the Dark," said director-producer Greg 
Holford, a theater professional with extensive credits in stage and film. "It's 
fun, it's very different. The opening act has more of a Broadway-type feel. The 
second act is very much darker, very intense, with more story-oriented stage 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the eclectic selections are Pink Floyd's "In the Flesh," "Only a Lad" 
from Oingo Boingo and the Eurythmics' "Sweet Dreams," plus big stage numbers 
from "Miss Saigon," "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" and "Evita." 
</P>
<P>
 Challenge is key, Holford noted. "This is a group that has had to be able to 
go into a studio and record an album, turn around and shoot a production number 
in a movie, and next day maybe do a musical theater number in an industrial 
stage presentation. It's bing, bing bing -- you gotta be able to handle 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a creative way to grow," enthused Rob Zaher, 22, who has been with 
Rock Theatre since he was 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaher, who aspires to a recording career, started in the beginners' workshop, 
an eight-week program for children meeting two hours a week, moved up to the 
Kids of Rock intermediate group, and finally became part of the advanced 
performance group, training 10 hours a week in semester-long segments and 
performing. 
</P>
<P>
 (Fees range from $100 for the beginning workshop to $250 a semester for the 
advanced program; many students unable to pay the fee receive scholarships.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of hard work," said Harris, who started with the group in 1987. 
"You have to give up a lot -- your friends, your social life -- but I feel it's 
the best thing in town (for young performers)." 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunity is there for everybody," Zaher added. "It just takes a 
conscious effort to make the decision to develop your abilities and . . . an 
attitude of cooperation and personal maturity." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Pallone, head engineer and studio producer at GTS Records, made the 
decision to use Rock Theatre singers on the label's new Christmas album, which 
also features the Encore Chorus and the Paulist Boy Choristers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rock Theatre was a pleasure to work with," Pallone said. "They're great 
singers and they work hard. When I auditioned them, I was very impressed -- I 
wanted to get their sound on a record." 
</P>
<P>
 Some performance programs for youth stress self-esteem rather than 
professional career training; Rock Theatre's advanced programs do the latter. 
That is why, Holford said, "I require all staff members to be working members 
of the profession. Because we're so in touch, it keeps the kids in touch, so 
they have a chance to get out there and compete against the real pros out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Choreographer Julie Bond is a case in point. Her recent credits include the 
role of Mrs. Potiphar in "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" on 
Broadway and at the Pantages. Slender and pretty, with a chiseled dancer's 
body, Bond has been with the company for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her reason for staying? "With all the people who've worked with me, I think 
it's important that I give something back. If they're willing to put in the 
work, I'll give all I can." 
</P>
<P>

DISNEY ROARS IN KINGDOM OF MOVIE MERCHANDISE; MARKETING: THE ENTERTAINMENT 
GIANT COULD REAP $800 MILLION IN PRETAX PROFITS OVER THREE YEARS FROM THE SALE 
OF 'LION KING'-RELATED ITEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Walt Disney's latest film hit, "The Lion King," the lion cub Simba grows up 
to thwart his treacherous uncle Scar and assume the mantle of leadership left 
him by his courageous father Mufasa. From an immature squeak, his roar grows to 
one worthy of a Lion King. 
</P>
<P>
 While King Simba rules the movie's Pride Lands, in the land of animated films 
and the sophisticated marketing that accompanies their release, Disney is the 
Lion King, emitting a merchandising and licensing roar heard around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly every toy and department store and in most homes with school-age 
children, the Lion rules. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Lion King' will be the most profitable picture Disney has ever had and 
the most profitable picture in the history of Hollywood," says David Londoner 
of Wertheim Schroder, an investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Other films have been bigger box office successes. But none can match the 
multimedia marketing muscle of the Lion King. Lion King related merchandise 
will generate about $1.5 billion in wholesale revenues, Londoner said. Disney 
will, over a three-year period, rake in about $800 million in pretax profits 
from its Lion King enterprise, he estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "To put that in perspective, no other studio besides Disney has ever made more 
than $450 million from all its films combined in any one year," Londoner said. 
</P>
<P>
 What has made Lion King the marketing success of all time for Disney studios? 
</P>
<P>
 "If 'Lion King' were not a good movie, the whole merchandising effort would 
have flopped," said Ruth Roufberg, a toy consultant and nationally syndicated 
toy and game reviewer based in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Moog, a psychologist and advertising consultant in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. 
said, " 'The Lion King' is successful because it resonates with the real 
psychological themes of child development. It taps into childhood fears. It 
also taps into important themes of bravery and restitution." 
</P>
<P>
 But universal psychological themes alone do not create enterprises like "The 
Lion King." Credit the Disney marketing and merchandising juggernaut with 
making the cash registers ring long after the credits have rolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's "unbeatable brand name" and track record of creating characters that 
live in children's imaginations make it a sought-after licensing partner, said 
Paula Pierce of McCollum Spielman Worldwide, an advertising research firm in 
Great Neck, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're brilliant at advertising and marketing," Londoner says. Long the 
leader in the art of animated film, Disney has practically turned licensing 
into an art form. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney is just getting better at what they do," said analyst Christopher 
Dixon of PaineWebber. "We're seeing an extension of the licensing activity we 
initially saw with 'Aladdin,' 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'The Little Mermaid.' 
Clearly, 'The Lion King' benefits from that experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney creates brands with shelf life, says Karen Raugust, executive editor of 
The Licensing Letter in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at these films not just as a movie, but as a long-term 
entertainment brand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Licensers and retailers also count on the marketing support that Disney 
provides. 
</P>
<P>
 "In effect, the toys are pre-sold to the consumer," said toy consultant 
Roufberg. She noted that the toy industry's annual Toy Fair, held in February, 
featured "tons of Lion King merchandise" on display for retailers, months ahead 
of the film's summer release. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the money invested by Disney, by licensers, manufacturers and 
retailers, a whole culture grows up around pushing the merchandise to kids," 
Roufberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the tributaries, Lion King merchandise appears to be flowing into the 
hands of eager young consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys R Us has more than 200 Lion King-related products highlighted by 
jungle-like displays at store entrances. It says the items have been 
"extraordinarily" successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie brought a phenomenal amount of people into our stores to look at 
Lion King-related products," said Toys 'R' Us spokeswoman Carol Fuller. She 
said the toy retailer expects Lion King lunch boxes to be a big back-to-school 
success and Lion King products -- ranging from pencil boxes to sleeping bags -- 
to be "a huge seller" right through the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattel Inc. spokeswoman Donna Gibbs says the giant toy manufacturer projects 
worldwide revenue from its Disney products to reach $400 million in 1994, up 
from $330 million last year, due largely to the success of Lion King products. 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney said the thrust of its business remains entertainment, not 
retailing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The film does come first," cautioned Chuck Champlin, spokesman for Disney 
Consumer Products. "We all watch the animation group with such admiration and 
awe. Without the original product, the merchandise wouldn't come to anything."

 Hoffman Co. Land Brokers: In another sign of increased activity in the 
Southern California real estate market, the Irvine-based brokerage said 
Wednesday it has sold $57 million worth of residential land in the past four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The company expects to close another $100 million in land sales by December, 
more than double what it sold during all of 1993, said Byron Hoffman, its 
president. "There is a tremendous amount of activity as builders move to secure 
finished or near-finished lots to meet the growing demand for new homes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly $31 million of the land sales were in Orange County, for a total of 410 
housing lots in Mission Viejo, Aliso Viejo, San Clemente and Coto de Caza. The 
rest of the land was in the Antelope Valley area of Los Angeles County.

IRVINE FIRM WINS $4-MILLION JUDGMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County jury has awarded the top two executives of the Irvine 
architectural firm more than $4 million in a judgment arising from a dispute 
with its insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Scottsdale Insurance Co. of Scottsdale, Ariz., was ordered to pay the judgment 
to LPA Inc. Chairman Leason Pomeroy and Chief Executive Officer Robert Kupper. 
The awards included $2 million in punitive damages, said Los Angeles lawyer 
Bill Conkle, who represented LPA. 
</P>
<P>
 LPA had sued Scottsdale Insurance in 1991 in Orange County Superior Court 
after the insurer failed to pay its legal bill on an unrelated lawsuit 
involving investment in a pension fund.

IPS HEALTH CARE ACCEPTS $12-MILLION TAKEOVER OFFER; MERGER: IRVINE COMPANY WILL 
BE ACQUIRED BY DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING SERVICES. NO LAYOFFS EXPECTED. 
</P>

 IPS Health Care Inc. said Wednesday that it has agreed to be acquired by 
Diagnostic Imaging Services Inc., a privately held company that provides 
medical imaging services throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-stock deal would be worth about $12 million at Wednesday's closing 
price of $3.375 a share for IPS common shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company will be called Diagnostic Imaging Services Inc., and its 
headquarters will be in Culver City, where Diagnostic Imaging is located. 
</P>
<P>
 The IPS administrative office in Irvine will remain in operation, and no 
layoffs are anticipated, said Norman Hames, owner of Diagnostic Imaging. The 
combined companies will have about 160 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The merged company will operate six outpatient imaging centers, 15 ultrasound 
laboratories in hospitals and two mobile magnetic resonance imaging units and 
13 mobile ultrasound units that provide service to more than 100 hospitals and 
medical office buildings in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Hames will be chairman, president and chief executive officer of the merged 
companies. He declined to discuss the roles, if any, that IPS management will 
play in the combined company and IPS officials could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls for IPS to issue approximately 3.5 million shares of its 
common stock to Hames, making him half-owner of the new company, which would 
continue to be publicly traded on the Nasdaq market under the Diagnostic 
Imaging name. Hames also would receive options and warrants covering about 
380,000 shares.

NOT FADE AWAY MAKES MARK IN TIE-DYE APPAREL; CLOTHING: FIRM HOLDS LICENSE TO 
PRODUCE T-SHIRTS AND OTHER MEMORABILIA FOR WOODSTOCK CONCERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is nothing far out about the old shirt factory Not Fade Away Graphics 
occupies, nothing groovy about its weathered brick facade or the rusting barbed 
wire that keeps would-be thieves out. 
</P>
<P>
 And the company's founder, Martin Leffer, is decidedly not laid back, although 
he sometimes props his legs up on his desk and leans back against a makeshift 
bookcase. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to watch people because sometimes they will take advantage of 
you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the philosophy of the 1960s, which the 46-year-old Leffer is a 
product of, and which his tie-dye T-shirt and hat business depends on for 
nostalgia and chic. But it may be a clear-eyed appraisal of the '90s, in which 
Not Fade Away competes for a buck in the worlds of sports and music 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 The company holds licensing agreements to produce T-shirts and other tie-dye 
memorabilia for the 25th Woodstock Anniversary concert being held in nearby 
Saugerties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see our Woodstock stuff being strong for a good year," he said. "If it's a 
memorable concert, we think it could be good for 25 more years." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Woodstock '94 came along, Leffer had already gotten Not Fade Away 
products into some 3,000 retail stores worldwide thanks to some canny marketing 
and the public's persistent appetite for tie-dye apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sooner or later, everything gets recycled and comes back," said Bruce 
Sachenski, editor of Imprinting Business, a screen-printing trade publication 
in South Plainfield, N.J. "It has a lot to do with the maturing of the 
customers. A lot of the people who are buying them now were hippies or Grateful 
Dead people a while back who never lost the appeal for that style. And now it's 
something new for the young people." 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial tie-dyers today use stronger dyes, two or more colors and more 
symmetrical patterns than the basement or back-yard tie-dyers of the '60s. Most 
also add screen-printed designs to the same garments, or more sophisticated 
flourishes on hats such as embroidered emblems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manufacturers are getting more sophisticated with their designs," said Ellen 
Parker, associate editor of the Dallas-based garment trade publication 
Impressions. "People are not going to be satisfied with just a plain, tie-dye, 
twisted rubber band-type of garment from the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with more elaborate designs have come upscale prices. It is now common 
for a tie-dye T-shirt with a screen-printed design to cost between $25 and $30, 
Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Fade Away is a licensed marketer of Grateful Dead merchandise, and nearly 
half of its T-shirt catalogue is a variation on the Dead theme -- the band's 
trademark skeleton as a jack-in-the-box, a skull in a bed of shamrocks, the 
skeleton skiing down a slope of snow and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Fade Away also has a line of T-shirts with the likeness of the late reggae 
artist Bob Marley. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly as lucrative has been the company's connection with sports. When the 
Grateful Dead sponsored the Lithuanian basketball team at the 1992 Olympics in 
Barcelona, Not Fade Away supplied the red, gold and green warm-ups, with the 
figure of a skeleton dunking a basketball on the jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 The team wore the warm-ups when collecting its bronze medals, and, nearly 
overnight, Not Fade Away arrived as a force in its industry. It was a heady 
time for a company on the fringes of the counterculture and the conventional 
business world. By the end of the first week after the Olympics, it received 
50,000 orders for Lithuanian warm-up T-shirts from around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Fade Away has also made T-shirts for the U.S. ski team at the 1994 
Olympics, basketball's Portland Trailblazers and hockey's New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leffer's appearance doesn't suggest a captain of an industry. Short, lean and 
intense with curly, graying hair and beard, he spent most of the 1970s at a 
spiritual community in Tennessee. When his marriage collapsed, he returned to 
his native Upstate New York. He was a ski instructor before tie-dye became his 
life in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 His office is also unremarkable. Two sets of mounted and framed tickets from 
the original Woodstock show in 1969 are on the wall. There's a dirty Oriental 
rug on the floor and a pair of old socks beneath the desk. Over his head is a 
framed letter dated March, 1993, thanking him for the blue jeans jackets. 
</P>

STEELMAKER WILL SELL TUSTIN'S PACIFIC NATIONAL INSURANCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A small, Orange County-based business property and liability insurer with 95 
employees is part of a group of insurance firms being sold by giant stainless 
steel maker Armco Inc. to Vik Bros. Insurance Inc. of Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Northwestern National Holding Co., the Armco subsidiary that 
owns 50-year-old Pacific National Insurance, said Wednesday that the Tustin 
company is one of three business insurance units involved in the approximately 
$85-million sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately held Vik, the spokesman said, has no plans to relocate or otherwise 
change operations at the company, which recently moved its headquarters to 
Tustin from Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Completion of the sale is subject to approval by regulatory authorities in 
California, Wisconsin, Indiana and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Armco said it is selling its ongoing insurance operations to concentrate on 
specialty steel production. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance companies, all owned by Armco subsidiary Northwestern National 
Holding Co. of Milwaukee, are Pacific, with $35 million a year in premiums; 
Milwaukee-based Northwestern National Casualty Co., with $185 million in annual 
premiums, and Statesman Insurance Co. of Indianapolis, with $45 million in 
annual premiums.
