 Over at Pasta Etc. on Sunset Plaza, three distinguished-looking men were 
holding their coffee cups and smoking their after-lunch cigars while seated on 
the restaurant's curb. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that even though they were dining at the restaurant's outdoor tables, 
that wasn't good enough for their anti-secondhand-smoke neighbors.

 A Tall, Hot One: What do people drink on one of the hottest, humidest, most 
wretched days of summer? 
</P>
<P>
 As we placed our order for a frosty iced nonfat half-caf latte at our local 
Starbucks, we were dumbfounded as customer after customer ordered hot coffees. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? we discretely asked a few of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It stimulates me, cools me down. It's more psychological than anything. I 
used to work ona boat where it was real hot and we always drank coffee," said a 
burly man. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, if you drink hot coffee, your body temperature goes up and you don't 
react to how hot it is outside," pontificated another. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 20 years I lived in Central Utah where it's bitter cold. I'd rather sweat 
than freeze any day," said a customer going back for a refill.

 Highway Horseplay: Slogging back home on the 405 from our monthly trek to the 
Rose Bowl flea market -- where we happily haggled over a matching pair of 
Fiesta nut dishes -- we spotted a girl, passing us on the left, who was wearing 
a bikini top that matched her metallic-lavender Mustang convertible. Her hair 
clip was lavender too. 
</P>
<P>
 Then our savvy flea-market friends started pointing out more young, carefree 
types cruising around in Mustang convertibles. We thought off-road vehicles 
were trendy, we mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 " Everybody rents Mustangs in Hawaii," we were told, feeling slightly out of 
it.

TECHNO-HIGHS; BLANCHE D'ALPUGET CULTIVATES FEARS OF HIDEOUS SUPER-VIRUSES IN 
THE HANDS OF YOUR NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR.; WHITE EYE, BY BLANCHE D'ALPUGET (SIMON & 
SCHUSTER: $22; 256 PP.)

<P>
 Summer may be nearing its end, but the days of a ripping good read under a 
beach umbrella aren't over yet, especially now that Blanche d'Alpuget has 
written "White Eye." 
</P>
<P>
 From the creepy prologue to the gut-punching last page, her plot roars along 
like a Land Rover on a bumpy trail in the outback. Murders pile up, along with 
animal rights abuses, industrial sabotage, even a plan to annihilate humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 It all begins when a beautiful corpse turns up near an isolated Australian 
research lab and an eagle is shot out of the sky as it prepares to swoop down 
on the warm flesh. By the time the body's cold, the story has spread out in so 
many directions, the murder seems almost a red herring. But in this tale of 
psycho-scientists, eco-warriers and blood-thirsty birds of prey, everything 
comes together in the end. Love, death, animals, humans and deadly gene-spliced 
viruses are all part of the fabric that binds the contemporary world together, 
for better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 If this sounds like a standard sci-tech thriller, it's not. D'Alpuget, a 
master of fine-tuned characterization, has loaded her stage with some of the 
most distinctive rogues, battered idealists and nut cases in current fiction. 
There isn't a throwaway or walk-on part in the pack. This population of 
desperate critters -- many just beasts in human form and most related to one 
other through a complex web of small-town intermarriage and adultery -- lift 
the enterprise from a plot-driven chase to an offbeat meditation on humanity 
and its future. 
</P>
<P>
 Take John Parker, the twisted, sloppily groomed man of science who is moved to 
tears over virulent bacteria, plots to quash worldwide population growth 
single-handedly and believes that, "To be a complete human . . . one must be a 
complete animal first." His wife Sonja, a simpering ninny who adores him, turns 
out to be equally savage and unbalanced, a revelation that finally wins her 
man's respect, though not his loyalty. Then there's Diana Pemberton, the 
novel's heroine, a gutsy yet emotionally damaged environmentalist who has 
learned what determination is during her years of training great wild hunting 
birds. It's a safe assumption that Diana, once she gets wind of evil doings at 
"the Research," won't rest till she knows what's happening there, even if she 
has to risk her own life. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounding Diana are hordes of secondary players: a financially strapped 
pilot who transports chimpanzees illegally to be guinea pigs for Parker's 
madness; the head of the lab's security, a lonely widower for whom bliss is a 
cozy chat with his cop daughter about a murder case; a pair of goofy 
adolescents whose nighttime rambles in search of fun lead them straight to the 
scientific snake pit. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the novel's themes, in fact, is that none of us are very far removed 
from the creeping, crawling heart of darkness. But human savagery -- often 
deliberately cruel and chaotic -- outdoes anything found in nature, where 
cruelty is more dispassionate, more routine. Worse, humans control the world's 
technology, which is moving faster than we can decide what to do with it. 
There's a constant danger that the wrong people -- wolves in men's clothing -- 
may be gaining power over the destiny of all: humans, animals, life itself. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Alpuget, award-winning Australian author of three previous novels and two 
biographies, has done extensive research to make this point ring true, and to 
render such scientific complexities as gene splicing comprehensible to the lay 
reader. She has also written a poetic book that brings the natural and 
human-made world alive in stunning imagery -- in the "split-apple shape" of an 
owl's face; in a flock of cockatoos, "broad-shouldered, yellow crests erect, 
yelling at each other like drunks in party hats;" in a small town "laid out 
like the vascular system of a narrow leaf." 
</P>
<P>
 Such writing -- together with the hurtling story line -- does a lot to 
compensate for a few flaws in her design. These include the almost offhand and 
not totally convincing revelation of the murderer. And later on, amid a 
sequence of vengeful bad-guy killings, one good guy is spared for no clear 
reason other than to match him up with another character in a truly cinematic 
scene of romantic rescue. (Two will-be lovers, knocked around, bloodied, fall 
on each other in a weedy field as the villains fly off in a Cessna.) 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's hard not to see "White Eye" -- also the nickname of the virus 
that causes victims' eyes to ooze horribly before they die -- as a movie, and 
even a sequel, since the book closes with the suggestion of more adventures to 
come. But most enjoyably, "White Eye," the novel, offers a ride through 
territory both literary and entertaining.

ALL ABOUT ERICA; IF ERICA JONG WERE A TRULY REBELLIOUS SPIRIT, SHE WOULDN'T 
NEED TO REMIND US OF IT SO OFTEN; FEAR OF FIFTY: A MIDLIFE MEMOIR, BY ERICA 
JONG ; (HARPERCOLLINS: $24; 320 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Julia Braun Kessler, Julia Braun Kessler is the author of Getting Even With 
Getting Old. She is most recently co-author of Presumption, a sequel to Pride 
and Prejudice. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If it comes as a bit of a shock to self-proclaimed bombshell Erica Jong to 
walk into a room and suddenly find that she is no longer the "youngest" or the 
"cutest" there, she certainly has our sympathy. Yes, these things can happen, 
to the blessed, the talented, even to the thinking person. Then again, 
superstars have always found ways to cope with the dismaying process known as 
aging. For the desperate, there is always cosmetic surgery, the spa, an 
athletic trainer, a special diet; others, alas, like Marilyn Monroe, may resort 
to an even more radical solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Jong's current title harks back to her first, fearless smash in 1973, "Fear of 
Flying," in which she coined an unquotable phrase about a "zipless" form of 
pleasuring she designated as the "symbol of my generation's hunger for female 
freedom through sexual freedom." As for her latest, "Fear of Fifty," she has 
appended to it the subtitle, "A Midlife Memoir," thus protecting the book from 
the rather specific rules governing autobiography; namely, that one must begin 
at the beginning, "I was born in . . . ," and progress from there. That 
explains why, from the outset, one is met by Jong's faux-naive reaction to the 
closing of her fifth decade of life -- her discovery of gradual decay in the 
carnal self. It would seem, Mr. De Mille, that she does not exactly relish her 
next close-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she willingly admits she "will never be Madonna or Tina Brown or Julia 
Roberts," she regrets much more that by the time this book comes out she will 
no longer even be considered for "the flavor of the month." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the statistics get her down: "Every year another crop of beauties 
assaults me on the streets of New York. With thinner waists and blonder hair 
and straighter teeth, with more energy to compete (and less cynicism about the 
world), the class of 1994, or 1984, 1974, is inexorably replacing my class 
Barnard '63 -- yikes!" 
</P>
<P>
 So her real trouble is that her attitude to turning 50 resembles the ingenue 
stance of her salad days. For about 20 years now, since her first novel, the 
feisty, competitive, foulmouthed, confessional shtick has worked admirably for 
this writer; it carried her to fame and fortune. Why not shoot into midlife on 
the same wave? 
</P>
<P>
 The trick might just have worked too, at least as fiction -- a midlife 
heroine's outrageous romp around (gulp!) the clock. But, when it comes to 
autobiography ( good autobiography at least), there are, unfortunately, some 
essential requisites. First off, autobiography needs more from a confessor than 
her simply being "famous for being famous," as the historian, Daniel Boorstin 
has phrased it. Then again, the genre inevitably invites comparisons with 
superior minds. We need to know, for example, why the detailed, intimate 
recitation of a certain woman's life might engage? And why at this time? Will 
it reveal insights into her special genius, her achievement in the literary 
art? 
</P>
<P>
 One is reminded of the late Anthony Burgess' story of his early life, "Big 
Wilson and Little God," or Mary McCarthy's "Memoirs of a Catholic Girlhood," 
two memorable voices, both for their evocation of their artistic careers and 
their honesty about their own petty failings. Jong's tale clearly does not 
avoid the latter. Indeed, hers is a remarkable candor; nor can she be faulted 
for not telling all. The question is: Does she exhibit more than we really care 
to see? 
</P>
<P>
 With Burgess or McCarthy, we welcome the revelation of gaping faults behind 
their brilliant constructs and imaginative creations because they teach us what 
their humanity is like. But Jong's confessionals, on the contrary, appear more 
like a preemptive strike against oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there aren't some lively reminiscences to be found in "Fear of 
Fifty." Several of Jong's takes -- for example, her tender recollections of her 
Bohemian Jewish family, her relationships with her sisters and grandparents, 
her indulged Manhattan childhood, her delicate first loves -- are touching, and 
seem true to her notion of herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In such chapters as "The Mad Lesbian in the Attic," about her old aunt's 
desertion by her lover of 30 years as she succumbed to dementia and 
Alzheimer's, and "Baby, Baby, Baby," about the birth of her beloved daughter, 
she sounds genuine in her emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Most affecting, perhaps, is her reprise of her affair with her latest husband, 
who seems literally and symbolically to have cured her of her long-held fear of 
flying. A passionate pilot who is transfigured each time he is airborne, and is 
eager to open such experience up to the fearful Jong, he clearly becomes the 
perfect hero for Jong at 50, with herself so eager to be "free of her body." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's her interview with her father, in which she challenges him with, 
"You'd still like me to be a doctor, wouldn't you?" and he answers with 
compliments about how fine a writer she really is, and how her only problem is 
bad PR: "Look at Madonna. She's got no talent, but great PR. Why don't you call 
that Della Femina guy. He'll advise you." This is delightful too. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows, however, is an editorial commentary she repeats after most of 
the charming narratives in the book, and it reads like a "making it" whine:  
</P>
<P>
 "How can I explain to him that the vicissitudes of my career cannot be undone 
by mere 'PR.' I have broken rules that are invisible to him because he is a 
man: written openly about sex, appropriated male picaresque adventures for 
women, poked fun at the sacred cows of our society. I have lived as I chose, 
married, divorced, remarried, divorced, remarried again -- and still worse 
dared to write about my ex-husbands!" 
</P>
<P>
 And with this comes her self-exculpatory conclusion that hers is "the fate of 
rebellious women. They used to stone us in the marketplace. In a way, they 
still do." It begins to seem as if this is the pathetic refrain of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistake not. Jong's problem is not in having written about her (mis)adventures 
but in presenting them as though they were the vital news, the real poop, and 
right for everywoman, instead of mere cliches formulating what Jong defines as 
the sexy, the liberated, the feminist life of courage. 
</P>
<P>
 A sample of some of her profundities: 
</P>
<P>
 "Married men are, of course the best lovers, unless you happen to be married 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Divorce is my generation's coming of age ceremony -- a ritual scarring." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dead mothers are rather easier for teenage girls to honor than live ones." 
</P>
<P>
 "Conversation. It fills a lot of life's little gaps." 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps the deepest, most Jongian, of all: "You don't get to choose what 
you get famous for and you don't get to control which of your life's many 
struggles gets to stand for you." 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding!

GOOD GOSSIP NEVER GOES STALE; FRESH DISH ON THE 48-YEAR MARRIAGE OF A RUSSIAN 
LITERARY GIANT AND HIS TORMENTED WIFE; LOVE AND HATRED: THE STORMY MARRIAGE OF 
LEO AND SONYA TOLSTOY, BY WILLIAM L. SHIRER (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $25; 400 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Jacoby, Susan Jacoby, a New York-based free-lance writer, is the 
author of two books on Russia and Wild Justice: The Evolution of Revenge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The aggrieved 48-year union of Leo and Sonya Tolstoy, whose own way of 
unhappiness remains singularly compelling even in an era of instantaneously 
disseminated scandal, has provided an inexhaustible mine of psychological 
speculation, literary analysis and plain gossip for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love and Hatred," by the late journalist and historian William L. Shirer, is 
the most recent -- though it surely will not be the last -- exploration of the 
marriage between the Russian literary giant and his tormented (and tormenting) 
muse-amanuensis-wife. The marriage was a disaster from the beginning, when 
Tolstoy insisted that the 18-year-old Sonya read his diary detailing extensive 
premarital sexual adventures, to the end in a rural railroad stationmaster's 
house where the 82-year-old genius died after fleeing home and wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirer, the author of 15 other books -- "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" 
remains his best-known work -- completed his account of the Tolstoy marriage in 
1993, shortly before his death at age 89. As the author notes in his forward, 
he began the book "as an inquiry into why Leo Tolstoy's long and productive 
life ended as it did: strangely, irrationally, and in tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 In a purely factual sense, there would seem to be little need for such an 
inquiry. The profound emotional and philosophical fissures in Tolstoy's 
character, reinforcing and reinforced by the struggle that was his marriage, 
afford an explanation for his end that is not only sufficient but also 
overdetermined. In his magnificent "Lectures on Russian Literature" (1988), 
Vladimir Nabokov offers a brief sketch that casts more light on Tolstoy's 
contradictions than all of the bloated biographies of the great man: 
</P>
<P>
 "His appetites constantly led him astray from the quiet country road that the 
ascetic in him craved to follow as passionately as the rake in him craved for 
the city pleasures of the flesh. . . . (B)eginning in the late seventies, when 
he was over forty, his conscience triumphed: the ethical overcame both the 
aesthetic and the personal and drove him to sacrifice his wife's happiness, his 
peaceful family life, and his lofty literary career to what he considered a 
moral necessity: living according to the principles of rational Christian 
morality -- the simple and stern life of generalized humanity, instead of the 
colorful adventure of individual art." 
</P>
<P>
 In an imaginative sense, Tolstoy's latter years and his final flight -- far 
more tragic for the rejected Sonya than for her husband -- offer considerable 
material for reflection on the part of anyone who is interested, as Shirer 
obviously was, in the passions of old age. 
</P>
<P>
 Several reviewers have criticized Shirer for focusing on the period after the 
publication of "Anna Karenina" in 1877, when Tolstoy, then approaching 50, 
steadily became more of a preacher than an artist -- and when the split between 
his sensual nature and his moral disgust at the act of sex grew even more 
pronounced. (Tolstoy's shame did not, however, prevent him from continuing to 
have sex with his wife, whom he impregnated 16 times.) 
</P>
<P>
 It is understandable that contemporary readers should prefer the younger 
Tolstoy, the author of "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina." Without the art, 
after all, Tolstoy becomes just another bearded Russian prophet -- one whose 
misogyny turned life at Yasnaya Polyana, his country estate, into a genuine 
hell for the woman who was expected to serve his genius. However, Shirer does 
an admirable job of demonstrating that Tolstoy was all of a piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout most of their lives, Leo and Sonya read each other's diaries by 
mutual consent. Two highly intelligent people, both aware that Sonya had been 
traumatized by the revelations in Leo's premarital diaries, they continued to 
torture each other with intimate disclosures that would be likely to destroy 
any marriage in any era. 
</P>
<P>
 As Shirer points out, the Russian publication of the definitive edition of 
Sonya's diaries in 1978, followed by an English translation in 1985, has 
substantially altered what was once the prevailing view of the Tolstoy 
marriage. In scrutinizing the marriage of a male genius, pre-feminist scholars 
were basically uninterested in the woman's side of the story. Shirer does not 
make that error. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on diaries that have been extensively cited in recent years by other 
biographers (of both Tolstoys), Shirer nevertheless selects excerpts that 
illuminate the particular nature of the mismatch. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the Tolstoy's youngest child, Vanya, died at age 7. On Feb. 23, Sonya 
recorded that her "darling little Vanechka died this evening at 11 o'clock. . . 
. My God, and I am still alive!" Sonya did not write in her diary again for 
more than two years, when she observed that she had closed both her diary and 
"my life, my heart, my feelings, my joy." 
</P>
<P>
 Tolstoy expressed a very different view after Vanya's death. "The death of 
Vanechka was for me . . . a manifestation of God, drawing me towards Him." A 
few weeks later, the concerned husband criticized his wife on the ground that 
she had "invested all her spiritual energies in animal love for her little 
one." Predictably, Sonya was enraged when she read the passage. Tolstoy, that 
Job's Comforter, continued to offer moral lectures instead of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 After this failure of empathy, it is not such a long distance to the railroad 
station at Astapovo, where a photographer snapped a pathetic picture of Sonya 
(reprinted in the book), barred from the bedroom of her dying husband, with her 
face pressed against the window. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of this account, one can only conclude that the "irrational" 
circumstances of Tolstoy's death were no more irrational, or tragic, than the 
preceding marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirer offers no elegy of his own. Instead he quotes the Tolstoys' daughter, 
Tanya, who described her parents as "intimately close to one another and 
infinitely far apart. . . . And who will take it upon himself to call one of 
them guilty?"

ATTACK OF THE ANTI-HEROES; IT'S HIGH TIME FOR BRET EASTON "WUNDERKIND" ELLIS TO 
SURPRISE US, TRY SOMETHING NEW.; THE INFORMERS, BY BRET EASTON ELLIS (ALFRED A. 
KNOPF: $22; 226 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Neal Karlen, Neal Karlen is the author of Babes in Toyland: The Making and 
Selling of a Rock and Roll Band, to be published this month by Times Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe McGinniss' gravest crime against literature was not "The Last Brother," 
the author's recent and ridiculous faux-biography of Ted Kennedy. Rather, 
McGinniss' worst felony was rushing Bret Easton Ellis, his fiction-writing 
student at Bennington College, to publish "Less Than Zero" at age 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the 1985 first novel was an excellent beginning for an obviously 
talented writer; "Less Than Zero" provided a provocative snapshot of a time 
when the anomic ditherings of idle, rich, drug-addled, white-bread Los Angeles 
young adults was considered fresh material. Bearing a canny journalist's eye 
for detail and dialogue, Ellis' storytelling already carried the complete lack 
of sentiment and empathy of a seasoned nihilistic novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis became a famous, best-selling young writer and was touted as the voice 
of a generation. But like a rookie phenom pitcher without a second pitch, Ellis 
immediately ran out of what ballplayers call stuff . 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Hemingway and Norman Mailer earned their material and early anomie 
through actual life experience; both had been to war by the time they were 
famous writers in their early 20s. Bret Easton Ellis, however, had only been, 
apparently, to Bennington. Walled in by his own youth and too early fame from 
any adult life experience, he refused to learn any new pitch beyond the 
Reagan-era ditherings of idle, rich, drug addled young Los Angeles adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly and predictably, during the years Ellis should have been apprenticing 
his skills and honing his chops, he wrote the same novel over, calling the 1987 
volume "The Rules of Attraction." This time, however, the insights were rarer, 
the humor almost absent, the prose as flat as a day-old latke . His characters, 
meantime, had degenerated into half-dimensional Barbie and Ken dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis was writing worse and acting stupid. In time, his Manhattan nightclub 
shenanigans, constantly and mockingly detailed by Spy magazine, provided a much 
more tragic story than anything he was typing. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time "American Psycho," his last novel, was published in 1991, Ellis 
was largely a joke among the young cognoscenti who'd once made him famous. That 
book, filled with the excruciating, affectless murderings of a serial killer, 
became a cause cele bre when it was boycotted by feminists as misogynistic 
pornography. The book was indeed a horror; by now Ellis had seemed to give up 
even the pretense of writing, and was content to simply transcribe lists of 
tony clothing manufacturers from the back pages of GQ. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, the publication of "The Informers," Ellis' newest book, is not a case 
of a literary comeback of a written-off one-hit wonder, but a further slide 
down for an author who long ago had it. Ostensibly a novel, the book is a 
plotless collage of short stories alternately narrated by a rogues' gallery of 
human monsters whose characters are developed with technical dexterity. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, for example, the club-hopping vampire who drains his bimbo pickups' 
blood dry; the dazed-on-downers studio wife who sleeps with her kids' friends; 
the rock star who makes underage prostitutes eat Kleenex; the young man who 
unashamedly rifles his just-dead friend's pockets for salvageable marijuana 
seconds after a hideous car accident. For a point, one must turn to the novel's 
publicity write-up, where we learn that the characters are "all suffering, 
whether they admit it or not, from no disease other than the death of the 
soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Ellis' publicist is a more interesting writer than Ellis, whose 
anti-heroes swim in swamps duller than bongwater. His notorious sex passages 
are often detailed with the kind of plodding, leering, badly described scenes 
published in Penthouse Forum: "The girl is pretty, blond, dark tan, large wide 
blue eyes, Californian, a T-shirt with my name on it, faded tight cutoff jeans. 
Her lips are red, shiny, and she puts the magazine down as I slowly move toward 
her, almost tripping over a used dildo that Roger calls the Enabler." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ellis isn't writing about brutal sex or casual murder -- which isn't 
often -- his scenes can sound like the product of an introductory 
fiction-writing workshop where students are told to record exactly a banal, 
everyday scene. "The Librium I took at dawn has worn off and my mouth feels 
thick and dry and I am thirsty," Ellis writes. "I get up, slowly, and walk into 
the bathroom and as I turn on the faucet I look into the mirror for a long time 
until I am forced to notice the new lines beginning around the eyes. I avert my 
gaze and concentrate on the cold water rushing out of the faucet and filling 
the cup my hands have made." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the sex-and-slice passages so nauseating that it doesn't 
matter if a joke is intended. At one point, the vampire relates in a relatively 
mild scene in "The Informers" how "I begin to lick and chew at the skin on her 
neck, panting, slavering, finding the jugular vein with my tongue, and I start 
bleeding her and she's laughing and moaning . . . and blood is spurting into my 
mouth, splashing the roof, and then something weird starts to happen. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a rancid phoniness to Ellis's delivery of his chosen demimonde. 
Again, one suspects the author's early suffocation by fame. While William 
Burroughs and Charles Bukowski spent anonymous decades on the fringes living 
the perverse material they turned into art, Ellis had spent the better part of 
his waning youth playing the buffoon at Nell's. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, meantime, is rendered in just the kind of soggy cliches that 
Ellis dissected so neatly in "Less Than Zero." It's not just that he's 
hopelessly mired all of his novels in the pre-riots, pre-O.J. 1980s. After all, 
decades after they were published, Nathanael West's "The Day of the Locust" and 
Alison Lurie's "The Nowhere City" still capture the city's unique brand of 
status-driven dread with the timeliness of a new episode of "Entertainment 
Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, however, is unable to transcend his chosen decade, to make his 
relentless name-dropping of mediocre 1980s rock groups somehow bring his story 
alive for the latest generation of disaffected youth for whom Duran Duran is of 
no more cultural relevance than Mario Lanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, at 31, is still young enough to be the voice of Generation X, and it is 
a mantle he still seems to covet. But he long ago lost that race -- and to a 
rock singer no less. The late Kurt Cobain of Nirvana wrote the poetry that will 
be remembered as the "Howl" of the twentysomething slacker army; his words, " 
Here we are now / entertain us ," long ago swamped Ellis's entry -- the once 
famous opening line to "Less Than Zero": "People are afraid to merge on 
freeways in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even after his precipitous fall from the ranks of America's most promising 
young writers, Ellis apparently has not learned the lesson of empathy, either 
on the page or in life. In the August issue of Vanity Fair, Ellis commented on 
the real voice of his generation: "The thing that struck me about Kurt Cobain's 
suicide is not that I was sad but that it wasn't Kathie Lee Gifford." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Ellis' late oeuvre , the statement was opaque and bitter, devoid of both 
humanity and meaning. One hopes he will spend the coming years working on the 
craft he abandoned after "Less Than Zero."

WHAT IS A LAWYER'S DUTY?; FOR THREE YEARS, ATTORNEY POLLY NELSON DEDICATED 
HERSELF TO ATTEMPTS TO SAVE TED BUNDY'S LIFE.; DEFENDING THE DEVIL: MY STORY AS 
TED BUNDY'S LAST LAWYER, BY POLLY NELSON (WILLIAM MORROW: $23; 336 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sarah Caudwell, Sarah Caudwell formerly practiced at the English Bar, and 
has written three crime novels with a legal setting. She has also written a 
play, The Madman's Advocate, about the M'Naghten case. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Killing someone is a serious matter -- or so, in a civilized society, it is 
usually believed. Murder, say defenders of the death penalty, is a uniquely 
terrible crime, which can aptly be requited only by a uniquely terrible 
punishment. By the same token, however, the existence of that penalty places a 
uniquely heavy burden on those involved in the process of its exaction -- on 
judges, on juries and not least on the lawyers for both the prosecution and the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1986, Polly Nelson, recently qualified as a lawyer and with no 
previous experience of criminal matters, was asked by her law firm to apply for 
a stay of execution on behalf of Theodore Bundy, convicted and sentenced to 
death in Florida six years before for a series of brutal murders. Though an 
appeal was pending in the U.S. Supreme Court against conviction and sentence, 
the state of Florida had fixed an execution date; if no stay were granted, he 
would die in 10 days' time. She agreed to make the application -- what else 
could she do? 
</P>
<P>
 "Defending the Devil" is Nelson's account of her experiences over the 
following three years, during which almost the whole of her time and energy was 
devoted to attempts to save Bundy's life. After three stays of execution, he 
was finally executed on Jan. 24, 1989, amid chilling scenes of triumphant 
public rejoicing. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a book about Ted Bundy, or about his crimes: though the author 
does not seek to conceal or extenuate their horrific nature, she dwells no 
longer than necessary on the details. It is a book about being a lawyer; about 
trying to do one's duty as a lawyer; about going on trying to do it even when 
the legal system and the client himself seem to be conspiring together to 
prevent one doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Bundy killed women totally unknown to him, for no other reason than his 
desire to kill. It would be curious and disquieting if we did not think that 
prima facie there is at least some doubt about the sanity of such a man. But 
the insanity defense was never effectively put forward at his trial, because 
Bundy himself did not wish it to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Bundy did not want to be thought mad; he wanted to be thought brilliant. The 
dearest ambition, it seems, of the failed law student was to star as advocate 
in his own defense in a case attracting maximum publicity; and perhaps, since 
he believed in the fantasy of his own brilliance, he did not understand that it 
would cost him his life. When his counsel at the original trial in 1979 moved 
for a declaration that he was not competent to assist in his own defense, Bundy 
successfully applied for the appointment of special counsel to argue on his 
behalf that he was. The prosecution not surprisingly agreed, and the court 
decided that he was competent without hearing either evidence or argument to 
the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it through extreme cynicism or extreme naivete that the judges before whom 
Bundy appeared colluded in his fantasy? They used such expressions as "the most 
competent serial killer in the country" and "a diabolical genius," then passed 
or upheld the death sentence -- not the usual result of brilliant advocacy or 
even of efficient criminality. 
</P>
<P>
 A catastrophic overconfidence in one's own abilities is not, of course, a 
characteristic exclusive to the insane; but Bundy's "brilliance" is equally 
inconclusive of the issue. True, in the 17th Century the insanity defense was 
available only to a person having less intelligence than a normal 14-year-old 
child. Since then, however, the law had been thought to have progressed. By the 
middle of the 19th Century, when Daniel M'Naghten gave his name to the rules 
that form the basis for the modern law on criminal insanity, it was known by 
doctors and accepted by lawyers that many forms of severe mental illness are 
consistent with a high degree of intellectual ability. We begin, like the 
author, to suspect that neither the judges nor the state of Florida cared much 
whether Bundy was sane or insane, or indeed whether there were any other 
legitimate grounds for an appeal. They simply wanted to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 The story takes on the quality of a macabre farce as again and again Nelson 
shows how the time limits imposed, by executive action or judicial order, made 
it almost impossible for the defense case to be properly prepared or presented. 
The politicians, dealing with a case attracting extreme public odium, wanted to 
demonstrate their toughness; the judges wanted to stop their court lists being 
"clogged up" with "technical" applications that would not have been made in a 
non-capital case. 
</P>
<P>
 But killing someone is a serious matter -- or so, in a civilized society, it 
is usually believed. If it is to be done in pursuance of a judicial decision, 
then that decision should be reached, above all others, after careful 
reflection, rather than in instant response to public outcry; above all others, 
in accordance with the "technical" rules of evidence and procedure established 
by the law to avoid miscarriages of justice. Otherwise what then occurs is not 
properly called an execution -- it is called a lynching. 
</P>
<P>
 In the context of such a system as she describes, it is understandable that 
Nelson should have begun to feel that it was she who was behaving 
unprofessionally, perhaps even neurotically, in making so much of the affair. 
She gives the impression of believing -- other people perhaps have told her -- 
that to commit herself so entirely to her work on the Bundy case showed a lack 
of proper detachment and objectivity. I think she is wrong about this. She had 
no illusions about Bundy's merits as a person, felt no less revulsion than 
others for the things he had done; she devoted her time and energy to trying to 
save his life for the simple, honorable reason that she was a lawyer and he was 
her client.

FOCUS; PARALLEL LIVES; WHAT HAPPENS WHEN 'TEENSOMETHING' MEETS 
'FORTYSOMETHING'? 'EVERYTHING AND NOTHING'

 Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, the creators and executive producers of the 
yuppie favorite "thirtysomething," had long wanted to do a show exploring the 
trials and tribulations of adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a subject of concern for us," says Zwick. "It was an idea before 
'thirtysomething,' " Herskovitz adds. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "The Wonder Years" and even "Doogie Howser, M.D.," received acclaim for 
their portrayal of teen-agers, but Herskovitz and Zwick have not been thrilled 
with the way teen life generally has been depicted on the small screen. They 
hope to change all that in their new ABC series, "My So-Called Life," which 
examines teen life from a female point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our feeling had been that most depictions of adolescence had been 
exploitative in the sense that they exploited those aspects of teen-age years 
that are titillating or stimulating," explains Herskovitz, who is executive 
producer with Zwick. "The sexuality of it. The violence of it. What we objected 
to in the portrayal of teen-agers was they were portrayed by older people. They 
did not capture the essence of change and youth that only a child of that age 
can give you." 
</P>
<P>
 The hour drama, premiering Thursday, revolves around the everyday existence of 
Angela Chase, a bright, introspective 15-year-old, played by newcomer Claire 
Danes. Angela arrives at a crossroads: She has grown away from her best 
girlfriend and begun to hang out with the class wild girl; she quits the 
yearbook and dyed her brown hair flaming red. She even falls for a boy who has 
repeated the same grade. She's not the only one going through an identity 
crisis; her parents, Bess Armstrong and Tom Irwin, are approaching their 40s 
with midlife crisis written all over them. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnie Holzman, a former "thirtysomething" writer, created the series and is 
co-executive producer. What makes the series unique, Holzman says, is its 
female perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say it is all brand new, because nothing is brand new, but I 
don't think that is done as much as it is with boys. I think it's always a 
wonderful feeling to do something maybe people didn't expect or maybe a little 
different than what they are used to." 
</P>
<P>
 The series, Herskovitz explains, is about "everything and nothing. I think our 
point about adolescence is how intense and overamped every moment seems to be 
whether it's an issue with a teacher or an issue with a friend. The plots, such 
as they are, are merely the ways to give voice to the other agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 Holzman acknowledges there are stylistic and thematic similarities between "My 
So-Called Life" and "thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of the similarities is these shows are about people's emotions, 
maybe a little more than other shows," Holzman explains. "That's the thing that 
kind of makes it like life. The emotions don't always have to be about big huge 
events, because in our lives very tiny things can trigger very big emotions. 
That's what I find interesting to write about. There's a level where we are all 
interested in the small details of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Before creating the series, Holzman recalls, she read an article in a fashion 
magazine about the hormonal changes that happen to women approaching menopause 
and the fact that they're similar to what happens when a girl hits adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has similar effects because you are hormonally imbalanced at the time," 
Holzman says. "That (fact) captures the whole show for me because, for me, 
that's what it's about. The mom and the daughter are facing a lot of similar 
identity crises and actually the dad, too. It seems as though they are in 
completely different places in their lives, but when you scrape away from the 
surface and get down to it, it's similar." 
</P>
<P>
 Middle age, she says, is a natural time of questioning and "reassessing the 
path they took in life. The parents are going through, to some extent, a 
midlife crisis while their daughter is going through the crisis of identity 
which is adolescence. They have more in common than they realize. I find that 
so touching." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela's school friends also are struggling. "That's the singular link for the 
whole show," Holzman says. "Everyone in the show is engaged in that struggle. 
Hopefully, sometimes comically." 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, Holzman would like families to watch the series together so they can 
"laugh about the same things and cry about the same things. I think that 
everybody's point of view is fairly represented. The parents are not made out 
as buffoons and the kids are not made out to be irresponsible, although they 
may do irresponsible things. The parents may make mistakes, but basically 
there's a respect for all the characters. I think people are all struggling and 
trying to do their best. " 
</P>
<P>
 "My So-Called Life" premieres Thursday at 8 p.m. on ABC.

A SEASON FOR ALL TIME; OCTOBER 1964, BY DAVID HALBERSTAM (VILLARD BOOKS: $24; 
376 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1964 baseball season didn't happen just so David Halberstam could come 
along and write about it, but it certainly seems that way, especially 30 years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the 1964 baseball season, which culminated in a memorable 
seven-game series between the New York Yankees and St. Louis Cardinals, was 
considered a good one, but over the years the series and the season have taken 
on greater stature. Some World Series may have featured more great players -- 
though two Cardinals and three Yankees from the '64 teams eventually made it 
into the Hall of Fame -- but not one has featured a more fascinating collection 
of vivid personalities, individualists who left lasting imprints on the game 
and who go right on being an important part of it today. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a book on the players who shared the '64 season was inevitable 
considering how many books the players themselves wrote. Jim Bouton, the 
iconoclastic Yankees' right-hander, went on to write "Ball Four," perhaps the 
most influential baseball book of the modern era; Curt Flood, the Cardinals' 
center fielder, wrote an autobiography that detailed his heroic and doomed 
assault on the "reserve clause," which bound players to one team for life; and 
even Mickey Mantle, who didn't seem to have even one book in him back when he 
expressed himself by slamming bats into water coolers, has nearly a dozen 
volumes with his name on them. The Yankees' Whitey Ford and Yogi Berra and the 
Cardinals' Bob Gibson and Lou Brock have all produced books; even Bob Uecker, 
St. Louis' second-string catcher, was able to parlay the season into two books 
(and a movie career). These two teams may have written more books than any 
other two teams have read. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the big advantage Halberstam has here over his previous baseball book, 
"Summer of '49." Virtually all the principals are so articulate that "October 
1964" requires little explanation from the author about their importance: 
Bouton, Flood and Cards' first baseman Bill White (the first black president of 
a major league) are all very well aware of their place in baseball history. 
Indeed, many of them seemed to be aware of it while they were making it. 
</P>
<P>
 What were they putting in the water in 1964 to produce players of this kind? 
Halberstam answers the question with what was in the air: questions of race in 
the wake of civil rights victories, the anxiety following the death of J.F.K., 
the increased liberalism of American society, the escalating war in Vietnam. 
Halberstam doesn't belabor any of these points but shows how the changes in 
baseball reflected changes in America. 
</P>
<P>
 For this there is no better symbol than the fact that 1964 marking the last 
pennant won under the old Yankee regime of Del Webb and George Weiss. In the 
1950s and early '60s it was common to hear people say that "rooting for the 
Yankees was like rooting for U.S. Steel," but by 1964 the famous Yankee farm 
system had dried up, the scouts had been released, and the minor-league 
franchises sold of or dismantled. The team was sold to CBS, which presaged the 
coming dominance of the TV tail that would wag the baseball dog. 
</P>
<P>
 What Halberstam brings into focus, however, is that the Yankee decline really 
set in when the ultraconservative front office found reasons to avoid signing 
the great young black prospects who poured in the National League after the 
demise of the Negro Leagues. Nothing points up the contrast between the fading 
dynasty of the Yankees and the upstart Cardinals (who were to win three 
pennants from 1964 to 1968) better than this: The Cards, generally regarded in 
the Enos Slaughter postwar era as the worst team a black player could wind up 
on, was, by 1964, powered by Bill White, Bob Gibson, Lou Brock and Curt Flood 
at a time when the only black Yankee regular was catcher Elston Howard, the 
first black player the Yankees signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "October 1964" is the best example of a new kind of baseball book -- Mark 
Ribowsky's recent "Don't Look Back: Satchel Paige in the Shadows of Baseball" 
and Roger Kahn's 1993 effort, "The Era," are others -- that covers familiar 
territory but makes it new by including the essential information left out the 
first time around. In Halberstam's narrative, Branch Rickey, the executive who 
broke the color barrier in baseball by signing Jackie Robinson, is slightly 
less heroic than he's usually painted. For instance, in response to criticisms 
that the white major leagues were destroying Negro League ball, Rickey replied 
that black ball was "a booking agent's paradise . . . they are not leagues, and 
have no right to expect organized baseball to respect them." Casey Stengel, 
possibly the most popular manager in baseball history, is a little less like 
the wise, funny old elf he appeared to be in the press: "The writers worshiped 
him, but the players came to look upon him as a rather cold-blooded albeit 
wealthy grandfather who still controlled the family will." It would be unfair 
to label Halberstam's point of view "revisionist"; it was the saintly picture 
of men like Rickey and Stengel in the '50s that was the revision. 
</P>
<P>
 As a historian, Halberstam has the delightful quality of writing like a fan, 
but sometimes as a baseball writer he sounds too much like a historian. It's 
doubtful we'd be reading this book if we didn't know that George Steinbrenner 
was "the owner of the Yankees who went about furiously hiring and firing 
managers." We would know that the Waldorf in New York City is "both literally 
and figuratively a long way from (Clete Boyer's home of) Willard, Kansas" -- 
even if we had never heard of Clete Boyer. And Halberstam is mistaken if he 
thinks Sandy Koufax's 1963 season when he won 25 games for the Dodgers was a 
"career year"; Koufax won more games in 1965 and 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 But the overview afforded by "October 1964" is splendid. Given the 
cookie-cutter approach to marketing in modern sports, it's doubtful that anyone 
will be able to pick up a book in 30 years time and read about so many angry, 
intelligent, and interesting athletes as the ones who came together to play for 
the championship that fall.

 "My So-Called Life" series rests on the very talented shoulders of 15-year-old 
Claire Danes, who was all of 13 when she shot the pilot. "She's from New York 
and started acting about eight months before we did the pilot," Herskovitz 
says. "She is one of those rare individuals who emerges completely full grown 
as an artist." 
</P>
<P>
 "What she knows can't be taught," adds Zwick. 
</P>
<P>
 Holzman believes Danes is one of the most "incredible actresses I have ever 
seen of any age. It's a wonderful feeling to know that what I write she can 
embody. I can write the most complex multi-layered stuff for her and she's just 
able to deliver it and more. She brings so much to the role." 
</P>
<P>
 Danes believes the series is an accurate depiction of teen life today -- "as 
honest as TV can be. I mean being a teen-ager is different for everyone. I 
think Angela is withdrawing from her parents and rebelling in her own way." 
</P>
<P>
 The actress says she's different from her small-screen alter ego. "Of course, 
there's a little bit of me (in her) because I need to relate to her in some 
way. It's very funny. In episodic TV, you see your character grow because every 
week she is doing something new. So I'm living my life and I'm living Angela's 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Some episodes have been easier for Danes than others. "We did one called 'The 
Pimple," which was really easy to relate to because beauty and vanity are 
issues which have been in my life. There was another called 'The Substitute,' 
which was harder for me. It's about Angela being inspired by this man. You just 
have to wade through the ones that you don't quite get, because you probably 
won't get them." 
</P>
<P>
 Danes, a 10th grader, is very excited about doing the series. "It's everything 
I ever wanted and all of a sudden, it's here," she says. "It's a lot of stress, 
but I love it." SUSAN KING

THE NEXT PHASE

 Bess Armstrong had a panic attack when she read the pilot script for "My 
So-Called Life." "I went to my husband," she recalls, "and said: 'I don't 
relate to this at all.' My husband was very curious. He took it and scanned 
several scenes and said: 'Honey, this is you."' 
</P>
<P>
 In "My So-Called Life," Armstrong, who starred in the sitcoms "On Our Own" (in 
the '70s), "All Is Forgiven" and "Married People," plays Patty Chase, the 
mother of introspective 15-year-old Angela (Claire Danes). In real life, 
Armstrong, 40, is the mother of two boys, 6 and 2 1/2. For the last several 
years, she's put her career on the back burner so she could be with her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to "My So-Called Life," Armstrong had been offered other hour series but 
turned them down because she felt she would never see her kids. She decided to 
do this series because she knew and respected executive producers Marshall 
Herskovitz and Ed Zwick of "thirtysomething" fame, and her schedule would be 
flexible because it is an ensemble show. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she adds, "I've reached that age where there are diminishing numbers 
of great roles for an increasing numbers of women over 30. To get a chance to 
play something like this, I just looked at my kids and said, 'We are going to 
give this a try.' It has really worked out well." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong points out that both Patty and Angela are going through enormous 
changes in their lives. "I think they are both in search of a new identity at a 
moment of transition where they have been one person for a while, and suddenly, 
it doesn't work any more. They are both kind of trying to figure out who they 
are going to be in the next phase of their lives. There is one wonderful script 
where the same day Angela discovers a pimple, I discover that the lines don't 
go away while I stop smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 She and Claire have developed an interesting relationship. "Claire and I have 
gone to malls together," Armstrong says, smiling. "She has major mall stamina 
-- I thought I did!. It has been somewhere between friends and actually sort of 
having a kind of parent-child relationship. It's fascinating because I haven't 
experienced that. I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of Armstrong's own mother in Patty. "As much as my mother drove 
me crazy at times when I was a teen-ager, I'm so grateful now that I have her 
voice in my head," she explains. "There are moments with my boys when I think, 
there are no rules, you can't read a book somewhere that says this is what you 
do in this situation. You just have to wing it, you have to take a deep breath 
and make a choice. That is when I hear her. I understand the position she was 
in, the difficult choices she had to make -- to be the hammer, to be the bad 
guy frequently when you know your kid is going to be angry at you. You don't 
want that, but you have to do that. I find that I can do that with great ease 
because I'm secure in the fact that (my siblings and I) have remained 
unbelievably close to my mother despite the fact we battled with her the whole 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Doing the series, Armstrong says, has been enormously rewarding for her. "I 
feel like I'm coming alive. A lot of it's funny and it takes me in directions 
I've never been able to go before. I'm loving it. I don't think I could have 
ever been happy in a show where the characters took themselves seriously. I 
think my sense of humor would constantly be sabotaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Herskovitz and Zwick had approached her several years ago about doing 
"thirtysomething," but Armstrong had to turn them down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an impossible time in my life," Armstrong says quietly. "I had just 
had a child who was severely ill and didn't live. It was impossible timing. 
That's why I loved the timing of this. It was like my 'thirtysomething' 
experience changed overnight with that incident. I couldn't relate to most 
people's 'thirtysomething' experience. I couldn't do that show. So now I am 
doing 'fortysomething,' and we are in perfect sync." SUSAN KING

IN BRIEF: NONFICTION; LIKE HIDDEN FIRE: THE PLOT TO BRING DOWN THE BRITISH

 Cousins or no cousins, the kaiser hated the British. They diminished him. So 
he hatched this Grand Scheme. He would foster a jihad -- a holy war.The Germans 
would then lead millions of Muslims across the Ottoman Empire through Persia to 
Afghanistan, whence they would seize India, cutting Britain off at the roots, 
and knocking off Russia at the same time. Two could play at this empire game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an end run around World War I, and it had its moments, and its men. 
Wilhelm Wassmuss, for example, "the German Lawrence" in flowing blond mane and 
Persian robes, Mauser pistol in his sash, who careered about the desert 
persuading the natives that the Germans really were Muslims. (The kaiser, he 
said, had converted, made his pilgrimage to Mecca, and was now called "Hajji 
Wilhelm Mohammed"; the entire nation had followed his example. As Punch put it: 
"Deutschland Uber Allah.") Author Peter Hopkirk, on a roll after "The Great 
Game," has written another epic of derring-do, played out from Egypt to 
Kirghizia and beyond. Exotic settings; uncommon bravery; endurance and deceit; 
alliances, intrigue, betrayal: these are the components of Hopkirk's history -- 
most often told through the adventures of impossibly intrepid individuals -- 
and they are stirring tales indeed. P.S. The kaiser lost.

ON THE SET; SHORT SUBJECTS; PARODY ARTISTE JULIE BROWN HACKS AWAY AT TONYA AND 
LORENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE PAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's the only thing more frightening than a pair of 5-foot-2 females with a 
chip on their shoulders? 
</P>
<P>
 That same pair in ice skates and stilettos, argues "National Lampoon's Attack 
of the 5 Ft. 2 Women," premiering Sunday on Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
 With apologies to Nancy Reagan and Imelda Marcos, the petite and positively 
peeved queens of this two-part parody are Tonya (sounds like Harding) Hardly 
and Lenora (don't call me Lorena) Babbitt (Bobbitt). Both stories were written 
by Julie Brown and Charlie Coffey, the same pair who in 1991 brought us the 
Showtime comedy mock-umentary "Medusa: Dare to Be Truthful," parodying another 
notorious (and notably short) woman, Madonna. Additionally, Brown -- whose 
credits also include the Fox comedy series "The Edge" -- directed the Tonya 
segment and stars in both parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the spoof's title, a visitor to the set might have reasonably expected 
to see a kind of Lilliputian version of "Godzilla" in the making -- hordes of 
Gidgets descending on innocent villagers from Lillehammer to Virginia, 
inflicting all manner of below-the-belt injuries and looting shoe stores of 
every available size 5 1/2 pump. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, this visitor was hoping for a room full of people just like me: 5 
foot 2 (rounding off to the highest fraction of an inch) and eager to avenge 
the kind of lyric Randy Newman penned in "Short People": They got little baby 
legs/ They stand so low/ You got to pick em up/ Just to say hello.  
</P>
<P>
 Didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the actors on the set of "Tonya: The Battle of Wounded Knee" were 
largely your regular-sized people. And the only person running amok for the 
camera was Brown, who -- though just shy of 5 feet 2 under normal circumstances 
-- was laced into figure skates for her role as Tonya, a comic costuming choice 
that actually made her about 5 foot 6 during the segment. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Brown wears multiple-inch cha-cha heels for most of her scenes as 
Lenora (in "He Never Give Me Orgasm: The Lenora Babbitt Story"). Methinks the 
movie actually should have been called "Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 Women in Really 
Scary Footwear." 
</P>
<P>
 But, no matter. Shared height wasn't the only factor that compelled Brown to 
write and star in her tale of two larger-than-tabloids women. As the actress 
explains it, she and writing partner Coffey were at work on a "Medusa"-like 
parody of Michael Jackson when the singer was accused of child molestation, 
forcing them to scrap the project. ("Child abuse just isn't funny," explains 
Coffey with a sigh.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as luck would have it, skater Nancy Kerrigan was clubbed on the knee 
after a practice session, and people close to rival Olympic hopeful Tonya 
Harding were emerging as the bumbling culprits. Brown and Coffey had their 
substitute parody (with "Head of the Class" actress Khrystyne Haje as Nancy 
Cardigan), which turned into a two-part movie when they realized that the story 
of Lorena Bobbitt -- who admitted slicing off her sleeping husband's penis but 
was acquitted at trial -- paired nicely with the Harding tale. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both these tiny, really violent women," explains Brown. "Even if 
Tonya was innocent, which I don't believe, she still goes after pickup trucks 
with a baseball bat." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the matter of fashion sense, or lack thereof. Brown spent so 
much of the 18-day shoot outfitted in garish, form-fitting fashions and damaged 
wigs that she says she started "looking at the crew people's clothes 
enviously." 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole piece is like a celebration of trashy taste," she says. And, 
accordingly, nothing in the script proved too tasteless to be included. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, it got more tasteless in execution," Coffey says with a laugh. 
"That's part of why (filming has) been so much fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Fun, yes. But for Brown, the project has proven grueling as well. First, there 
was the tight production schedule, then the physical demands of a role that 
required one 14-hour shoot in a 20-degree Culver City ice rink. To top it off, 
she's also playing her own role as mom. Her then-6-month old son visited the 
set on occasion, but when Brown couldn't bring him along, she says it was "like 
you left your arm at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, she had some help. Richard Wenk ("Vamp" and the upcoming "Scalpers") 
directed the Lenora segment. And Coffey, Brown's writing partner for 17 years, 
spent a lot of time on the set, offering on-the-spot rewrites and 
improvisations when necessary. During -- and even after -- the filming, news 
events of the day kept the cases churning, making the segments' wildly 
fictional conclusions the best solution in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, all this along with the memory of the aborted Michael Jackson project, 
have made the writing team swear off satirizing nonfictional characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that we're never going to write about real people again," says 
Coffey emphatically. "You spend six months writing about somebody and then they 
go and strangle someone or shoot up a schoolyard." 
</P>
<P>
 Or become an actress. 
</P>
<P>
 "National Lampoon's Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 Women" airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on 
Showtime.

A HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY HECHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Italy, where this sort of thing can occur, 
</P>
<P>
 I had a vision once -- though you understand 
</P>
<P>
 It was nothing at all like Dante's, or the visions of saints, 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps not a vision at all. I was with some friends, 
</P>
<P>
 Picking my way through a warm sunlit piazza 
</P>
<P>
 In the early morning. A clear fretwork of shadows 
</P>
<P>
 From huge umbrellas littered the pavement and made 
</P>
<P>
 A sort of lucent shallows in which was moored 
</P>
<P>
 A small navy of carts. Books, coins, old maps, 
</P>
<P>
 Cheap landscapes and ugly religious prints 
</P>
<P>
 Were all on sale. The colors and noise 
</P>
<P>
 Like the flying hands were gestures of exultation, 
</P>
<P>
 So that even the bargaining 
</P>
<P>
 Rose to the ear like a voluble godliness. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, when it happened, the noises suddenly stopped, 
</P>
<P>
 And it got darker; pushcarts and people dissolved 
</P>
<P>
 And even the great Farnese Palace itself 
</P>
<P>
 Was gone, for all its marble; in its place 
</P>
<P>
 Was a hill, mole-colored and bare. It was very cold, 
</P>
<P>
 Close to freezing, with a promise of snow. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees were like old ironwork gathered for scrap 
</P>
<P>
 Outside a factory wall. There was no wind, 
</P>
<P>
 And the only sound for a while was the little click 
</P>
<P>
 Of ice as it broke in the mud under my feet. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw a piece of ribbon snagged on a hedge, 
</P>
<P>
 But no other sign of life. And then I heard 
</P>
<P>
 What seemed the crack of a rifle. A hunter, I guessed; 
</P>
<P>
 At least I was not alone. But just after that 
</P>
<P>
 Came the soft and papery crash 
</P>
<P>
 Of a great branch somewhere unseen falling to earth. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was all, except for the cold and silence 
</P>
<P>
 That promised to last forever, like the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Then prices came through, and fingers, and I was restored 
</P>
<P>
 To the sunlight and my friends. But for more than a week 
</P>
<P>
 I was scared by the plain bitterness of what I had seen. 
</P>
<P>
 All this happened about ten years ago, 
</P>
<P>
 And it hasn't troubled me since, but at least, today, 
</P>
<P>
 I remembered that hill; it lies just to the left 
</P>
<P>
 Of the road north of Poughkeepsie; and as a boy 
</P>
<P>
 I stood before it for hours in wintertime. 
</P>

IN BRIEF: TREEHOUSES: THE ART AND CRAFT OF LIVING OUT ON A LIMB, BY PETER

 How could Peter Nelson's "Treehouses" fail to please? Its subject is 
immediately attractive, with its implications of escape and fantasy. Through 
text and evocative color photographs by Paul Rocheleau, the book urges: Build a 
dwelling high in the air, surrounded by leafy nature.Design your arboreal haven 
according to the dictates of your whimsy, construct it with your own hands, 
then reward yourself by sitting contemplative in your shelter, "annihilating 
all that's made," as Andrew Marvell once proposed, "to a green Thought in a 
green Shade." Cannily, Nelson offers something for everyone: First there's a 
little historical background on this maverick subdivision of architecture. Then 
there's a substantial section on treehouses built by or for kids. A general 
how-to department segues into the real-life saga -- call it "Pete and Charlie 
Build a Treehouse" -- of how the author and a sidekick do it with considerable 
knowledge of carpentry and more than a little help from their friends. Oddly, a 
couple of the aeries Nelson features verge on the smug bourgeois comfort of 
banal grand houses. Most, though, are original and expressive, tailored to the 
available tree and fired by the individual -- often idiosyncratic -- 
imagination. They're emblems of independence, a significant part of America's 
mythic self-portrait. Aesthetically, the most memorable of the book's examples 
are a pair of irregular shacks attached to two gaunt, forked redwoods, created 
by a man mourning the death of his son by drowning. Pieced together from 
driftwood and other cast-off lumber, jagged, splintered and weathered gray, 
they have a wild, haunting beauty. Children still play in them, climbing their 
spiral staircases into the sky, nearly a quarter-century after the tragedy that 
fostered their creation. Tobi Tobias

 It's an engaging, old-fashioned picture. A retired teacher putters among his 
beloved books. A lifelong collector -- beginning with Dowden's two-volume "Life 
of Shelley" in "sumptuous inlaid morocco by Rivier" that cost more than a 
month's salary -- Jack Hodges contemplates a personal encyclopedia, a 
"treasury" if you will.What goes with what? Who with whom? Which of the masters 
will be included among "the virtuosos who sounded the Latin chords, and struck 
the notes of Anglo-Saxon for simplicity and strength"? In the end, he makes the 
sort of selection of traits, habits and talents one would expect from a former 
English prep-school instructor for whom the giants of literature remain as 
tangible as today's breakfast kippers, a selection at once erudite, eclectic, 
elastic and off-center: Ruskin, who brought his mother along to college, and 
Byron, who brought his mistress, a boxing master and a pet bear. Ian MacKay, 
whose railroad-engineer father once sneezed his false teeth out of the train 
and into a lake, and who "died of a strange encounter with a haystack," and 
Thomas Chatterton, "the poor posthumous child of a dissipated Bristol 
choir-singer." DuMaurier worked in a garden shed, Shaw in railroad carriages, 
Thackeray in a tavern and Coleridge composed the haunting "Kubla Khan" after 
taking two grains of opium, reading from "Purchas His Pilgrimage" and sleeping 
deeply for three hours.

 Ah, Dave Barry. A landscape strewn with the carcasses of cliches, where 
connections are tenuous and zits are big enough to cast their own shadows.Barry 
revisiting Arcola, Ill., to march in the Broom Corn Parade, "a wonderful 
small-town heartland event that features a tremendous outpouring of what can 
only be described as 'beer'." Barry responding to a reader who asks, "Please 
explain the expression 'This does not bode well,' ": "It means that something 
is not boding the way it should. It could be boding better." Barry in traffic 
court where "the tension was so palpable that you could feel it," successfully 
pleading "nolo contendere (Latin, meaning 'Can I pay by check?')" Barry 
surrendering to "the call of the sea. 'Hey, YOU!' are the sea's exact words." 
Mostly, though, there are Barry's everyday observations, original as sin and 
twice arrant: "When you see the Supreme Court justices, they always appear to 
be extremely solemn, if not actually deceased." "A snake should not be in your 
yard unless it has your written permission." And, following a reader poll, the 
world's worst lyrics: " 'There Ain't Enough Room in My Fruit of the Looms to 
Hold All My Love for You.' (This might not be a real song, but I don't care.)" 
Ah, Dave Barry.

 The house nearly steals the show from Frannie Vaughan. It's a fine old 
farmhouse, strong and solid the way they used to build them, and it's a lot 
more.Built by a great-great-grandmother with the inheritance from a man who 
done her wrong, it has been passed, by will and deed, to the women of the 
family so they will "always have their own place regardless of what the men in 
their life did or didn't do. . . . This house would be there for them." Frannie 
wants to keep the house, needs to keep the house. Sister Natalie wants to sell. 
Engaged to balefully bourgeois Jake, Nat wants to move to the suburbs, assure 
"A secure future." Do the Right Thing. Frannie is engaged to no one except life 
itself. A precious, fleeting thing, a mayfly. Too large of heart, too short of 
common sense, she wouldn't know the Right Thing if it bit her on the bum. 
Frannie loves indiscriminately -- nature, animals and men, lots of them. 
"Good-hearted wantonness," author Lawrence Naumoff calls it. She's a wanton, 
moreover, of underlying sadness, wistful for old-fashioned morality. And she 
can drive you batty. Naumoff, author of "Taller Women," is savvy enough to 
delay Frannie's destiny to the end, to let us build up a rare affection for the 
young woman. And check those underwear packets. You never know.

 In Barry Gifford's world, America gone swayback, orbited by eccentrics. 
Aberrations are the norm; morality is chancy; solutions are instant (Croesus 
Spackle, prison escapee, deciding to eradicate KKK: "Least we can do.We can't 
put some good in the world, might as well take out some bad"). No time to get 
close to Gifford's people, not that you'd want to. They'll be gone a few 
chapters up the road. Careen ahead with him then. Enjoy these single-minded, 
Bible-spouting, oddly lyrical curios as they streak by at the speed of spit. 
Ponder the resolve of Marble Lesson, icon of abused women, founder of the 
Mother of God Rape Crisis Center and Charm School: Kill all the dominant males. 
Collect their noses. Send those of married men to their wives. Toss the rest 
into the center's compost heap; "We grow the best squash." What's it all about? 
Search me. But one could do worse than heed the words of colporteur Get-Down 
Lucky on the meaning of life: "It ain't what you eat, it's the way how you chew 
it."

COVER STORY: HER MUSIC MAN; MARVIN HAMLISCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand and composer-conductor Marvin Hamlisch first made beautiful 
music together in 1973 when they collaborated on one of Streisand's best films, 
"The Way We Were." Hamlisch won one Oscar for his evocative score and another 
for the haunting title tune from the romantic drama, which also starred Robert 
Redford. The movie's title song became one of Streisand's biggest hits, and is 
one of the several standards she performs on "Barbra Streisand: The Concert" 
premiering Sunday on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one years after "The Way We Were," Streisand chose Hamlisch to conduct 
the 64-piece orchestra on her recent acclaimed SRO concert tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlisch, who also received an Oscar for his adaptation of Scott Joplin's 
music for "The Sting," has won four Grammys, a Tony and three Golden Globes. He 
composed the scores for the Pulitzer-Prize winning Broadway musical, "A Chorus 
Line," as well as "They're Playing Our Song" and "The Goodbye Girl." This fall, 
Hamlisch will become the principal Pops conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Pops. 
</P>
<P>
 The gregarious Hamlisch talked about touring with Streisand over the phone 
from his Long Island home with Times Staff Writer Susan King. 
</P>
<P>
 When Streisand introduced you in concert she quipped you didn't need the job. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't need the job, but I would never have said no to it. I thought it was 
the right thing to do. I wanted to be part of this. I just thought I was made 
to do this. I really wanted to do it very badly. 
</P>
<P>
 When this whole thing came about and I was asked to even think over this whole 
situation -- conducting for Barbra and working for her -- to me that was a 
privilege. We are talking about a great voice. By working with her I realized 
if she did not have this great voice, she still is a very great lady. What I 
loved about working with her and doing this is that it gave me a chance to not 
only get to know her and her to get to know me, but make a really good friend. 
My job was to make her as comfortable as possible so that she would start to 
enjoy that process. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you do that? 
</P>
<P>
 I think it was important that Barbra felt she could count on me -- that if I 
said an arrangement was going to be ready by a certain time, it would be. She 
knew if she didn't like an arrangement, we would have the time to change it. 
She also knew if she didn't like something, it wouldn't hurt my feelings to 
change it. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the evening turned out to be a very emotional evening for everybody. I 
tend to like to talk to people in the audience. I used to go out around 7:30 
p.m. and speak to people. A woman told me a very interesting thing about how 
she felt about the concert. She said when the concert was finished, she felt it 
was a very empowering concert, meaning that she felt somehow at the end there 
were things in her life she could achieve. When you work with her, it's the 
same force. She tends to inspire you to rise to her expectations, thereby 
bringing out the very best in you. I think that's why people who have worked 
with her, particularly, who like her and enjoy that, can have a very meaningful 
working relationship with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you have a favorite moment or song in the concert? 
</P>
<P>
 I kind of modernized the arrangement on "Don't Rain on My Parade," and every 
time we got to that point, which is very early, having her do it brilliantly 
used to be one of my fabulous moments. Most of the ballads were just killers. 
Particularly, I love when she did "The Man That Got Away." I loved "Lazy 
Afternoon." Obviously, I had to pinch myself every time she sang "The Way We 
Were." I think one of the most memorable moments, which is probably one of the 
more quieter moments, is when she sang "Not While I'm Around." 
</P>
<P>
 I must say I loved certain nights. Barbra tends to sing certain things 
slightly differently night after night because she wants to try new things. Her 
choices, which are totally intuitive, are brilliant. She just does things. The 
little nuances would be enough to propel you to look forward to the next night. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides her improvisational ability, what makes her such a great and unique 
performer? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, first of all she has got this voice. You just go, "Oh, my God." She, 
being a very literate, a very smart person, understands what she is singing. 
Therefore, she understands what the hell she is saying as she is singing these 
songs. She really gets into lyrics and understands lyrics. She can hold notes 
and make them soar and make them really quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert also demonstrates she has a good sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 I think people started to see a very human side of Barbra. I think she had a 
lot of fun with the audience. I think there was much more comedy. One of the 
things we kept talking about when this thing was being put together is that 
Barbra would tell me these stories and I would say, "Put it in the show." She 
has a wonderful way of putting the truth out there almost with a little bit of 
whimsy and that way you realize she is one of us. She is this person who has 
this great talent, but she is talking to us like she really cares. I think that 
was a very important thing about the concert to have her seen by her fans, who 
have been her fans for so long, as she is. She has a great sense of humor and 
she loves to laugh. I think the most fun I had was trying to make her laugh. If 
you make Barbra Streisand laugh, the reward is that you see the best smile in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 I found her to be very caring, very concerned about world politics, very 
concerned about her fellow man, very concerned about things she still wants to 
do. I am not sure she will ever know or recognize how much people really do 
love her and how much people have been her lifelong fans and care about her. 
There's something about the live experience -- the standing ovations and the 
people -- that's just exciting. There were nights she had a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 I think sometimes she could not believe the incredible ovations. The hardest 
thing I always had to do for the concert was trying to figure out when to start 
the first song because the ovation was so great.  
</P>
<P>
 "Barbra Streisand: The Concert" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on HBO.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; 'READY OR NOT,' HERE COME THE TEEN 
YEARS AND TOUGH TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Ready or Not enters its third season, the show's creators and producers 
hope to answer a question that troubles many pre-pubescent girls: Am I normal ? 
</P>
<P>
 This season, best friends Amanda (Laura Bertram) and Busy (Lani Billard) 
experience a typical bevy of emotional and physical upheavals. Amanda, the 
"ready" of the two, and Busy, the "not" part of the duo, encounter familial 
separations and reconciliations, first love, jealousy, racism, deceit, identity 
issues and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're exploring classic dilemmas," says Alyse Rosenberg, creator and 
executive producer of the new season. "The three different areas we're looking 
at are family dynamics, relationships and sexuality." 
</P>
<P>
 Focus shifts between the girls' home, school and personal lives. Early on, the 
dynamics of the family are examined, as Busy begins to see a family therapist. 
"During the season, we'll see how Busy and her family really benefit from 
therapy, and grow closer together," Rosenberg says. "Later, as Busy's family is 
mending itself, Amanda starts to fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda's anger about her parents' separation leads to an exploration of "all 
the issues within her family," Rosenberg says, including "what do you call your 
mother's boyfriend's daughter? What's your relationship with her?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Amanda's mother begins a serious new relationship, sexual issues come 
into play. "We look at what becomes the most upsetting, how distressing it is 
for kids and how they react," says Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual themes -- and curiosity about them -- run throughout the season. There 
are several looks at feelings, what's normal and what's not. 
</P>
<P>
 An upcoming show, with both girls as its focus, explores the difference 
between what is consentual and what is not, Rosenberg says. "We look at sexual 
abuse in contrast to mutuality," she says. "It becomes about knowing that 
you're in control about choosing to kiss someone." 
</P>
<P>
 While Billard, 15, and Bertram, 16, are older than the 11-to-12-year-olds they 
play this season, Bertram says, "it hasn't presented any problems. We're 
believable in the roles." 
</P>
<P>
 Bertram can often relate to the show: "It's sort of like what I'm going 
through with my own family," she reflects. "We're at a rebellious phase and it 
gets tense between your family and you. (It depicts) how emotional things can 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 Bertram offers her own take on the preteen and teen years. "Teens don't mean 
to be self-absorbed, but they are! Everything is new and so much is happening. 
They don't know what's right, just what they think is important. Adults have a 
lot of different values and don't always see eye to eye with kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tempting," Rosenberg says, "to play out the entire circumstance 
we've set up, to write a solution for the issues brought up in each episode, 
but I made a rule, no more 'I'm sorry' episodes." Rosenberg adds that she 
wanted to make sure that the show's situations about real-life issues mirror 
real-life responses, which don't always produce the happiest of endings. "The 
world," she philosophizes, "is not just black and white." 
</P>
<P>
 Bertram offers, "The show is pretty realistic. It doesn't make fun of them 
(pre-pubescent girls), doesn't turn it into a joke. The topics are serious to 
kids and adolescents, from their perspectives so they know what to expect and 
know that they're not alone." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready or Not" airs Sundays at 5 p.m. For ages 8 and up.

PAPERBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 VOICES OF THE XILED: A Generation Speaks for Itself, edited by Michael Wexler 
& John Hulme (Main Street/Doubleday: $14.95; 318 pp., paperback original). The 
editors of this collection of short fiction by young writers complain: "This 
generation hasn't had a chance to say anything at all. We just sit back and 
watch various critics try their hands at explaining to us who we are and why." 
Ironically, very little distinguishes "Voices" from other anthologies. 
"Lovelock" by Fred G. Leebron and "Her Real Name" by Charles D'Ambrosio, two 
tales of drifters seeking an emotional connection, suggest the disconnectedness 
that supposedly marks Generation X. Neither the style nor the subject of most 
of these stories indicates that the authors are 20-something. "Babies," Abraham 
Rodriguez Jr.'s searing portrait of a teen-age heroin addict, eclipses the 
other works, but it could have been written 5, 10 or even 20 years ago. Perhaps 
critics have attempted to define Generation X because its members have failed 
to articulate an identity. 
</P>
<P>
 KANIKSU: Stories of the Northwest, by Thomas F. Lacy (Keokee: $11.95, 142 pp., 
illustrated, paperback original). In this informal memoir, Thomas Lacy recalls 
growing up near Priest Lake in northern Idaho during the early 20th Century. 
Lacy notes how the land shaped the lives of men and women who balanced the 
freedom a woodland cabin offered with the loneliness and hard work needed to 
survive. His accounts of fishing and hiking, work and play have an avuncular 
tone that suggest the yarns a kindly grandfather might recount by the fire on a 
winter night. 
</P>
<P>
 A CASE OF RAPE, by Chester Himes (Carroll & Graf: $8.95; 105 pp.). Written in 
1956-57 by the African-American expatriate, "A Case of Rape" is as much a 
meditation on race and justice as it is a novel. When a white socialite dies 
under mysterious circumstances in a Paris hotel room with four African-American 
men, everyone assumes it's an open-and-shut case of rape and murder. Or is it? 
In the stark, staccato prose that marked his popular Grave Digger Jones and 
Coffin Ed Johnson mysteries, Himes explores the lives of his five characters, 
revealing just how deceiving appearances can be when the observer's vision is 
clouded by racist assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 THE AYE-AYE AND I: A Rescue Mission in Madagascar, by Gerald Durrell 
(Touchstone: $11; 175 pp.). The Aye-aye is a weird-looking primate with long, 
bony middle fingers that it uses to remove boring grubs from trees. Durrell 
recounts his efforts to establish breeding colonies of aye-ayes, gentle lemurs 
and flat-tailed tortoises in his familiar, engaging blend of tongue-in-cheek 
humor and ecological concern. The droll anecdotes leaven Durrell's lament for 
the shortsighted destruction of the odd, intriguing fauna of Madagascar, and 
give his work an appeal other natural history books lack. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SEED AND THE VISION: On the Writing and Appreciation of Children's Books, 
by Eleanor Cameron (Plume: $14.95; 362 pp.). In this expanded version of "The 
Green and Burning Tree" (1969), the National Book Award-winning novelist and 
children's author argues that a good children's book is first and foremost a 
good book, with sound internal logic, credible characters and imaginative 
prose. Cameron's reflections on psychology and psychobabble seem less sure than 
her discussions of literary style, but her primary concern is that children 
become "literate in a way that means reading will affect their lives, will give 
them a view of the human condition they would never have without it, that will 
become a companion to them all the rest of their days." 
</P>
<P>
 THE SIERRA CLUB HANDBOOK OF WHALES AND DOLPHINS, by Stephen Leatherwood & 
Randall R. Reeves, paintings by Larry Foster (Sierra Club Books: $18; 302 pp., 
illustrated). The authors designed this guide to fill the gap between arcane 
scientific literature and the popular whale books that frequently contain 
factual errors. The concise text describes the natural history and current 
status of the major species of whales and dolphins, with notes on how to 
identify them. Anyone planning a trip to the Central Coast to enjoy the recent 
sightings of humpbacks should bring this handy guide. 
</P>
<P>
 BECOMING AMERICAN WOMEN: Clothing and the Jewish Immigrant Experience, 
1880-1920, by Barbara A. Schreier (Chicago Historical Society: $19.95; 154 pp., 
paperback original). Of the 2 million Jews who came to the United States 
between 1880 and 1920, nearly half were women. The transition from the 
religiously segregated shtetls of Eastern Europe to an urban, secular society 
was not an easy one. Orthodox tradition decreed that married women dress 
modestly, covering their hair with wigs or kerchiefs; but wives who clung to 
the old styles were scorned as "greenhorns" by their friends and family: When a 
woman adopted modern fashions, her appearance became "both an expression and an 
extension of her painful adjustment to America." The catalogue for a traveling 
exhibition organized by the Chicago Historical Society, "Becoming" presents a 
moving account of a key episode in American social history. 
</P>
<P>
 CALIFORNIA'S NUDE BEACHES, by Dave Patrick (Bold Type Inc.: $15.95: 150 pp., 
illustrated). The 4th edition of this guide to places for all-over tanning 
includes sites in California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. Patrick offers 
brief directions, a capsule description of each site and general notes on nude 
beach etiquette: gawking, littering and lusting after other sunbathers are 
considered faux pas. A useful reference for readers who want to increase the 
risk of skin cancer in places where it will be particularly unpleasant to have 
removed.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

By Kevin Thomas

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mystery lovers can gorge on the true-life, two-part, four-hour 1991 And the 
Sea Will Tell (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m., concludes Tuesday at 9 p.m.), in which two 
couples, one middle-aged and rich (Diedre Hall, James Brolin), the other 
footloose post-hippies (Rachel Ward, Hart Bochner), fatally intersect in the 
summer of 1974 on the remote island of Palmyra, 1,000 miles south of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 TV movie Father & Son: Dangerous Relations (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), 
which has the parental theme of irresponsibility being handed down from 
generation to generation. Louis Gossett Jr., who is also the co-executive 
producer, stars as a black father who dumps his wife and 5-year-old son, then 
encounters his son (Blair Underwood) 20 years later in a prison yard where 
they're both doing time. 
</P>
<P>
 There's bad and there's laughably bad. The 1991 TV movie The Woman Who Sinned 
(ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is the second. As the plot twists pile up, this 
ludicrous Susan Lucci vehicle is an absolute howl. For openers, Lucci's art 
gallery owner has an extramarital affair because her husband (Tim Matheson) 
doesn't want kids. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suspenseful murder thriller Final Appeal (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.), a 1993 
TV movie, a hard-drinking, disbarred lawyer (Brian Dennehy) feels compelled to 
try to represent his younger sister (JoBeth Williams) after she guns down her 
husband and his mistress. As a loyal sibling, Dennehy offers an intriguing 
portrait of a guy who quietly, almost invisibly, tipples his way through the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Taffin (KABC Monday at 9 p.m.), a lackluster 1988 picture never released in 
major cities, stars Pierce Brosnan as a professional debt collector who 
undergoes a change of character when he finds himself up against an 
organization of corrupt businessmen and criminals intent on building a chemical 
plant in a small Irish community. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody but the public seemed to like the 1983 Flashdance (KCOP Friday at 8 
p.m.), a kind of full-length erotic aerobics class that stars Jennifer Beals, a 
Pittsburgh steel mill welder by day and a bar dancer by night who's intent on 
auditioning for a ballet troupe and having an affair with her impossibly rich, 
unattached boss (Michael Nouri). 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Peckinpah's brilliant, controversial 1969 commentary on violence, The Wild 
Bunch (KCOP Saturday at 7:30 p.m.) finds William Holden leading a bunch of 
border ruffians operating in South Texas and Mexico, circa 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 A lighthearted 1989 fable aimed at kids, except for the very young, Little 
Monsters (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) seems an incredible simulation of 
"Beetlejuice," so uncannily close is the manic energy of Howie Mandel's 
Maurice, the proverbial monster under the bed, to that of Michael Keaton's 
obnoxious-but-ya-gotta-love-him demon from hell. Fred Savage is its young hero, 
who manages to befriend Maurice, who belongs to a subterranean network of scaly 
gremlins who wreak havoc only at night.

 "Susie Bright Tells All" (by Mark Ehrman, July 24) reveals more than perhaps 
the subject intended.This crusading sexpert (whatever that is) feels what is 
wrong with society can be laid at the doorstep of sexual hang-ups and social 
restrictions. Yet she had a child from an "on and off affair" with a gentleman 
who "had a fetish for impregnating women." Bright apparently had no other 
reason for bringing a child into the world other than that he "popped the 
question just as her biological alarm clock was ringing." There is something 
wrong with this picture, but I'm not sure that it has anything to do with 
sexual hang-ups and social restrictions.

 Maureen Sajbel apparently doesn't offend liberal sensitivities in the 
slightest when she speaks of condoms on Christmas trees, Margaret Thatcher in 
drag or Jesse Helms reading Robert Mapplethorpe ("Window Dressing, 90210," 
Style, July 24).Such titillation at Christmastime is, as the writer sees it, a 
"wonderfully offbeat display." Shame on The Times for printing her vulgar 
tastes. Whatever happened to discretion?

 Can you tell us something about M. Giffin, the creator of the work of art that 
accompanied the fiction piece "Color Struck" (by Alyce Miller, July 17)? I cut 
it out to frame it. The image of the mother cradling her child is so arresting, 
I cannot take my eyes off it.

 Editor's note: Matthew Giffin is an illustrator/artist who recently moved from 
New York City to Toronto. His work has appeared in numerous magazines and on 
book covers for Oxford University Press. "The thing that struck me about the 
story was how the issue of skin color is all-encompassing in the United States, 
and that this issue had filtered down to the black mother and her albino child 
was tragic," Giffin says. "I wanted to do a picture where the woman would have 
dignity in her blackness, at the same time she would be looking up at the sky 
and there would be a question of whether she was asking God to make it work no 
matter what, or asking God why it happened to her."

COMMENTARY; VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE DIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been a TV addict for as far back as I can remember -- long before Dicks 
York and Sargent played Darrin Stephens, long before Oliver dahling whisked Eva 
Gabor off to "Green Acres" and lovable "Have-I-got-a-swamp-deal-for-you" Mr. 
Haney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mighty Mouse" kept me company mornings while dressing to face the nuns at St. 
Joseph's School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Popeye" entertained me during those bologna and Velveeta on Wonder bread and 
mayo lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" had me wondering if I did join the Navy (who 
cared if I was only 8 1/2?) would I be assigned to the same submarine as Capt. 
Lee Crane (David Hedison) and would he marry me? 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward to present day: infomercials and "Seinfeld" and the news from my 
doctor that I would be home for about two months recovering from surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can catch up on your reading," one friend offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes," I said. "I have been meaning to get back to 'Silas Marner' and oh, 
yes, Stephen Hawkings. And what a waste my life would be if during my time off 
I failed to reread all of Shakespeare and Dickens. Wasn't that Pip just a pip 
in 'Great Expectations?' ( Tee-hee-hee )." 
</P>
<P>
 Lie. Lie. Lie. 
</P>
<P>
 I engaged in the classics, all right: the "Gilligan's Island" episode where 
they almost get off the island, the "I Love Lucy" episode where Lucy and Ethel 
get in hot water with Ricky and Fred, "The Beverly Hillbillies" episode where 
Granny makes possum stew, and the "Andy Griffith" show where Andy teaches Opie 
one of life's lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 I was awakened to "Today in L.A." and dozed off to "The Three Stooges" at 2 
a.m. with "The O.J. Simpson Show" filling some afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a TV addict's dream come true. Imagine being a barbecue-ribs-a-holic 
and finding yourself locked overnight in a restaurant called Rib-o-rama. 
</P>
<P>
 When I tired of real life, I switched over to the soaps. 
</P>
<P>
 On "The Young and the Restless," Victor Newman had a new wife, but his old 
wife, Nicky, wanted him back after she lost her beau, Cole, to her daughter, 
Victoria, whose marriage to Cole was briefly in trouble when it looked like 
Cole might be Victoria's brother . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Things weren't much better on "The Bold and the Beautiful" for Sheila 
Forrester, who used to be on "The Young and the Restless" until she "died" in a 
fire after that whole ugly kidnaping mess, so she moved to L.A. and became the 
wife of the tres loaded Eric Forrester and fretted over her inclusion (or lack 
thereof) in his will, which presumably names his sons, but not little Bridget, 
who I'm convinced is Eric's daughter and not the daughter of Eric's son, Ridge, 
who has always loved Bridget's mother, Brooke, but has never married her, 
though now he's considering it because Brooke (whom Ridge calls "Logan") is 
about to marry James, the psychiatrist, who was in love with Ridge's late wife, 
Taylor, also a psychiatrist, who might not be dead after all . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Round and round it went. I was practically mainlining Visine in order to get 
maximum watchage out of my eyes. I applied Ben-Gay regularly to my "remote 
finger" to ease the pain associated with channel-surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one morning after an estimated trillion hours of TV watching, it all 
started to blend. Sorta like a Vulcan mind meld. 
</P>
<P>
 I was watching "Regis & Kathy Lee" and I could swear Sheila Forrester was on 
saying that she discovered the bloodied glove at the Simpson estate. 
</P>
<P>
 It only worsened. 
</P>
<P>
 After being very diligent about keeping track of what was on Montel, Oprah, 
Rolanda, Bertice, Jerry, Sally Jessy, Geraldo and Donahue (just in case I 
wanted to order a written transcript of a show), I drew a blank when trying to 
recall to a friend what talk show host had "I Married My Brother's Sister's 
Cousin's Mother-in-law's Uncle's Cat." 
</P>
<P>
 I had hit the wall and hard. 
</P>
<P>
 With my brain now complete and absolute mush, I ran like the wind into the 
literary arms of Shakespeare. I skipped "Hamlet," though. I had caught "My 
Boyfriend Can't Make Up His Mind" on Ricki Lake.

THIS WORLD TAKES NO HOSTAGES; DEAR DEAD PERSON: SHORT FICTION, BY BENJAMIN 
WEISSMAN ; (HIGH RISK BOOKS/SERPENT'S TAIL PRESS: $10.99, PAPERBACK; 224 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ellen Krout-Hasegawa, Ellen Krout-Hasegawa writes for the L.A. Weekly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The title story of Benjamin Weissman's short fiction opens with a quote from 
advice columnist Ann Landers, in which she calls "morbid curiosity . . . one of 
the less attractive qualities of human nature." Though not essential, a good 
dose of morbid curiosity might not hurt those hiking through this harrowing 
collection of short stories, Weissman's first. This work firmly places Weissman 
alongside colleague Dennis Cooper in the ranks of L.A. writers who feel right 
at home in a homicidal maniac's head. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he shares with the author of "Try," "Closer" and "Frisk" a 
predilection for the flesh-carving antics of men who prey on boys, at heart, 
Weissman is an egalitarian. Rather than limit his gaze to the murderously 
homophobic, as Cooper does, he observes madness in varied walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
 In the glibly titled "Squash," when a mother's brutal attempt to discipline an 
unruly 9-year-old fails, 200 pounds of parent nestles itself on the child's 
chest in hopes of teaching the boy a lesson. Predictably, the worst occurs. 
Unexpected is the mother's obliviousness to the suffering and eventual death 
she causes. With the authorities on their way, her defiant daughter still 
clutching the phone, sobbing and her son's lungs collapsing like an accordion 
beneath her, the mother complains, "I've gotten so uncomfortable I can't rise 
off our birthday boy to slap the nonsense out of the brat."  
</P>
<P>
 Weissman is a master at tracing the web of rationalization that killers weave. 
The book is at its most horrific when the reader is jolted by the shock of 
recognition, as in "Ardmore." Here a backwoods woman triggers a murder by 
notifying her half-crazed landlord, Ardmore, about the film crew that just 
showed up on his property. Ardmore launches into a rage, shouting, "No one's 
going to treat honest country folk like pharmaceutical monkeys!" He starts 
firing, and one of the cameramen with "out-of-state plates" falls down dead. 
Afterwards the woman is stricken with guilt, not over the bloodshed but over 
"being the center of attention." "I liked being filmed," she confides, "and I 
desperately want to see what I look like." Hollywood obviously is not the only 
place where vanity flourishes, especially when it comes to places in the world 
where loss of life is not nearly as tragic as living a life of dismal poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Weissman is at his most poignant in "The Future" and "The Present," which 
stand on their own but work best as companion pieces. In the former we meet an 
entrepreneurial Christian Scientist who is convinced that hog's blood will 
loosen death's grip on his wife's corpse. He says his son will help him in this 
endeavor but can't just yet for the son "can't think of anything except all the 
singing planets in the sky." In the latter story we meet another Christian 
Scientist who is unable to part with his dead wife, even though his son has 
already dug the hole in the back yard. The man gently bathes her corpse in 
Epsom salts and places it in bed beside him. He hugs and kisses the body and 
rolls on top of it. "Come on back," he whispers. "Here I am, wishing you were 
here, no place like home." Within these two stories Weissman finds briefly that 
uneasy balance between the absurd and the grotesque, which results in a 
heart-rending lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
 True, "Dear Dead Person" can read like a freak show but it's more than that. 
In "A German Moment," a Jewish narrator confesses to listening to German folk 
music on the radio, unable to enjoy it, yet dutifully turning to it every 
Saturday morning. "It's difficult," he says, "to get off the Holocaust channel 
because it's on the consciousness network twenty-four hours every day, forever. 
. . . (It) will always be popular because it's still so new, happened only 
yesterday and nothing is simpler or more confusing than exterminating people." 
</P>
<P>
 In language that could have come from the back of a cereal box, Weissman makes 
visible the driving forces of our culture (technology, advertising) that since 
Sputnik have accelerated our lives to a warped speed. Throughout the book, 
Weissman suggests that our civilization, still reeling from the atrocities of 
the last World War, has become a breeding ground for serial killers whose 
internal antennae pick up voices that coax them to create their own 
mini-apocalypses. Once you realize this, you realize that it'll take more than 
Dear Ann and her sensible advice to save you.

PALM LATITUDES: MIND AND BODY; PERSECUTION COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ellen Alperstein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After seeing several of their peers charged with sexual malfeasance , getting 
sued for purportedly encouraging the recovery of false memories and just 
generally getting hauled into courts for any number of problems, real and 
imagined, many California psychotherapists are, well, paranoid. 
</P>
<P>
 And, perhaps, with good reason. There are 8,000 to 10,000 lawsuits against 
therapists pending in U.S. courts, according to the Philadelphia-based False 
Memory Syndrome Foundation, and at least 1,000 of them are in California. 
Orange County, says attorney O. Brandt Caudill, is the epicenter of recovered 
memory lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe California has more of these lawsuits because we've got more 
touchy-feely therapists doing experimental things," suggests Newport Beach 
psychoanalyst Lawrence E. Hedges. "California has more therapists per capita 
than any other state, and many have limited training," he adds.  
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to educate the mental health community, Hedges, along with 
psychotherapists Robert Hilton and Virginia Wink Hilton, organized "Therapists 
at Risk," a seminar held earlier this year in Anaheim. More than 100 people 
came to learn about "the perils of the intimacy of the psychotherapy 
relationship in the current climate of accusation and litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Plundering the past is a double-edged sword, says Wink Hilton. "Therapists 
should be very cautious about ever leading or directing a client into recovery 
of lost memories; at the same time, this brings about a reticence to explore 
the very issues the client might need to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 This dilemma has resulted in several new support groups. The Los Angeles 
Society of Clinical Psychologists and the Los Angeles-based Professional 
Advocacy Network have both recently established groups for therapists who have 
been accused of an ethical or legal breach. The validity of the accusations is 
not at issue; the forums exist solely to allow participants to air their 
feelings about the perils of the psychic territory they mine, as well as the 
litigious nature of contemporary America. 
</P>
<P>
 The network is already reporting up to 100 calls a month -- half from 
California. Ellen Alperstein

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: ENGINEERING 101

<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In preparing this month's column, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was 
pulling a Tom Sawyer -- that I was tricking the other kids into painting the 
fence for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking young volunteers to test-drive some activity books and do a 
mini-review, I enticed parents with the words "Make your kid a star!" and 
hammered respondents with the guilt-inducing phrase "Share some quality time!" 
</P>
<P>
 They fell for it. And a column was born. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Sauceda-Rivera, age 9, offered to take Light Magic: And Other Science 
Activities About Energy, by Trudy Rising and Peter Williams and illustrated by 
Jane Kurisu (OWL -- Greey de Pencier Books, 56 The Esplanade, Ste. 302, 
Toronto, Ontario, MSE 1A7/416-971-5275: $9.95) for a whirl. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie, a fourth-grader who has done science projects in school -- including 
the light board mentioned in the book -- says "Light Magic" is "a good book for 
kids learning about science. It teaches how to make light bulbs, water and lots 
of things with electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did two projects from the book. One was to make a light bulb of your own 
(electric energy) and the other one was how to make a model hovercraft (energy 
of wind). The hovercraft, using a balloon, margarine lid and a used spool of 
thread in a pool of water, didn't work that good but it was a pretty good 
experiment anyway. It didn't work because every time it was set on water the 
air came out and (the craft) only moved a couple of inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The light bulb experiment worked pretty good. I used steel wool, a 6-volt 
battery, a couple of nails, cork, wire and a bottle for this experiment (plus 
adult assistance). The light lasted a few seconds. I liked the light bulb 
experiment because I got to work with electricity." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes Jackie's mom, Catherine Sauceda: "I found the book to be easy for kids 
age 8 and up to understand the basics of wind, electric, water, heat energy. 
The experiments are precise in directions using household items. They are 
relatively easy and fun with some required adult supervision or assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 There is quite simply no way that I would attempt the project in Build Your 
Own Empire State Building by Alan Rose (Addison-Wesley: $14.95), even though it 
comes complete with radio antenna and King Kong. There are too many pieces to 
cut out, too many pieces to piece together -- all of which require to expert 
handling of scissors and glue, neither of which I mastered in the second grade. 
So it's a good thing I found three stouthearted lads to put it together: Steve 
Margulies, Robert Rostig and Mark Bagwell, all 14 and all used to spending most 
of their free time in outdoor activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The book said it would take 8 hours to put together; that was about right, 
even with the team approach. 
</P>
<P>
 A parent's (Steve's dad, Lee) observation: "The boys didn't like all the 
cutting out of pieces that had to be done but seemed to enjoy putting them 
together. Clearly, however, it's not an experience any of them is looking to 
repeat soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert: "It's a fun group activity, if you have nothing else to do. But it was 
frustrating too. The wording of the directions is complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark: "Even if somebody likes to do models, I don't see why they'd want to do 
this. People collect cars or airplanes but nobody collects buildings!" 
</P>
<P>
 Steve: "I'd rather be skateboarding or bodyboarding than doing something like 
this. You seriously need a lot of time, because it's boring work. It'd be 
perfect if you were grounded."

 It is hard to know how many people read Harriet Beecher Stowe any more or care 
about her and her tumultuous times. But in her own time, she was the most 
famous and widely read American writer, a wonder to the world who showed what a 
woman writing could do. Joan Hedrick's excellent biography gives the 
contemporary reader a fresh look at the life of a powerful writer, a genuine 
moral force and an epochal figure in the modern history of women. Harriet 
Beecher was born into a celebrity family. It being the 19th and not the late 
20th Century, the Beechers' human drama was framed in terms of religion, reform 
and literary success and the notorious and scandalous changes rung on those 
mystic chords. Father Lyman Beecher was a vigorous and self-confident Calvinist 
whose major project was to stake a claim for the Calvinist faith in the West. 
His remarkable children included Catherine Beecher, whose career was a working 
out of women's role in society through education, and Henry Ward Beecher, an 
amalgam of Billy Graham, Robert Schuller and Wayne Newton. They crowded the 
public and domestic stage with vital energy, what Harriet's husband Calvin 
Stowe called the Beecher buzz -- much like the Kennedys, possessing something 
chemical, something vital, something troubled and something moral and 
political. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beechers and their projects typified the impulse of educated and religious 
elites in America's energetic early national period: To stir popular culture 
and direct its spread responsibly. Surely Harriet brought this strategy to its 
apex. Her unique novel, "Uncle Tom's Cabin," swept the country and the world 
with its mixture of feeling and power, with its irresistible drama and its 
moral force. The very things that struck its critics then strike them now. A 
book that played less on the familiar strains of racial stereotypes and 
sentimental convention probably would have had less success in setting 
antislavery works to the old familiar tunes. The personal and religious sources 
of "Uncle Tom" also contributed to the book's unmatched power. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedrick shows how Stowe's own situation as a woman, a writer, a daughter, wife 
and mother and as a Christian gave her version of the lives of the slaves and 
their masters such conviction, even as she points out how this version was 
problematic then and remains so. 
</P>
<P>
 But this new biography does something even more important than tell Stowe's 
life and do justice to its greatest work. Hedrick has not only done exemplary 
research, she has also read carefully and with evident passion in the 
extraordinary scholarship of women's history and culture that mostly women 
scholars have produced in the last few decades. Her book retells Stowe's own 
story in terms of what has been learned about women's lives.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether discussing Harriet's experience of the special hardships and illnesses 
that accompanied women's lot in the 19th Century and her pursuit of cures for 
these ills, her relations with her domestic servants, her husband and children, 
her writing or her audience, Hedrick gives new insight and shape to her story. 
The way in which, for instance, she connects Stowe's writing to the parlor 
culture and its particular style of women's expression makes Stowe's writing 
and that of her peers much clearer. Stowe's attempts to find a room of her own, 
as another writer was to put it, and time to write, will be familiar to modern 
readers. Perhaps less so will be her lifelong search for religious and 
spiritual meaning in that first new age of American history, in and out of 
reform movements, periodicals and health regimens. Hedrick's recounting of the 
curious and lasting marriage of Harriet Beecher and Calvin Stowe is sensitive 
and revealing without confusing the historical with the sensational.  
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Beecher Stowe outlived her greatest triumph. Her one monumental 
literary production has always cast its shadow on her other writing. This 
reviewer was grateful to Hedrick for her accounts of Stowe's other works. More 
importantly, Hedrick shows that Stowe's situation as a woman in the male club 
of American literature was only briefly alleviated when "Uncle Tom's Cabin" 
gave her a readership even misogynist editors and critics dared not ignore. 
Once her special success in figuring out the public taste was gone, Stowe was 
left like Rebecca Harding Davis and other women writers of her time, as 
outsiders to the Literary Establishment and the academic clique that was 
creating the definition of American literature taught ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This part of the biography offers Hedrick's most incisive analysis and her 
most pointed language. Hedrick argues as others have that the creation of a 
literary canon that excluded women writers was part of a strategy that had 
deliberate and far reaching cultural and gender agendas.  
</P>
<P>
 I imagine that there will be those who will find Hedrick's blending of Stowe's 
situation as a woman writer with her limits as a writer too complete. Hedrick's 
savaging of Henry James' savaging of Stowe's work is savage, but his reputation 
as a novelist will survive and his tactics as a critic were interesting and, as 
Hedrick shows, part of a comprehensive disenfranchisement of women writers. 
This biography will surely direct readers to Stowe's work; three of her novels 
are now available in a Library of America volume. It will also help readers to 
understand why the culture wars continue and will continue because, as Stowe 
understood, literary ground is contested ground or writing isn't worth writing 
or reading.

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; AM I BLUE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Joseph 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Hard Times. Strugglin'. You don't know where your next dollar is comin' from, 
where your next meal is comin' from." 
</P>
<P>
 In a city beleaguered by recession, temblors and a virtual celebrity-trial 
channel, it's not surprising that the blues are back. And local guitarist and 
singer Arthur Adams knows where people are coming from -- his gut-wrenching 
lyrics reflect the obstacles in his own life and times. 
</P>
<P>
 His music, which includes a mix of Southern blues, soul, rock and R&B, has 
lately been discovered by a new generation. "There is definitely a resurgence 
of younger people," Adams says. "Even school kids are getting into it. My 
daughter's 14 years old, and she's starting to like the blues." 
</P>
<P>
 His signature style is wading into a dark and crowded dance floor at clubs 
like the Mint in West Los Angeles with a wide-eyed intensity, furiously 
strumming his guitar inches away from a captivated audience. "I like to see 
people laugh and dance and get off to that. I give the people what they want -- 
and it keeps me workin'." 
</P>
<P>
 A Tennessee native, Adams' musical career began in the late '50s. After years 
of touring the South with the likes of Chuck Berry, T-Bone Walker and Etta 
James, Adams, 53, arrived in Los Angeles in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 His songs have been covered by B.B. King, Quincy Jones and Nina Simone, and he 
has recorded with James Brown, Bonnie Raitt, Diana Ross, the Jacksons and Joe 
Sample, among others, but he has yet to achieve commercial success. Although he 
released four modest-selling albums in the '70s, he depends on club and 
festival performances, session work and touring with more prominent acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams pauses and smiles. "I feel the blues. That's my roots, and I know the 
meaning of them. It's something I can feel, something that's part of me. Life. 
Death. Sickness. Hate. Love. Cryin'. I feel all those things when I'm playing 
the blues. And I know most people can relate to that." 
</P>
<P>
 He's thrilled about the rekindled local interest in the blues, particularly 
with the recently opened House of Blues in West Hollywood and soon-to-open B.B. 
King's Blues Club at City Walk in Universal City. "It's so exhilarating. This 
town is accepting the blues. We have evolved." Chris Joseph

CAUGHT MY EYE; THE BLUR FACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID EHRENSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's too early to tell if a new trend in book cover art is in the offing, but 
in the case of Caleb Carr's "The Alienist," the blur appears to have sparked a 
lot of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got actual telephone calls from our sales people about the cover," reports 
Random House creative director, Deborah Aiges. "Before the reviews or the ads 
or any of the publicity campaign started, people were walking into stores, 
looking at the cover and scarfing the books up in two seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for all this scarfing? The blur.  
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to covers, all the John Grishams, Judith Krantzes and Danielle 
Steeles of this world have to do is slap their names on the dust-jacket -- in 
giant embossed letters -- and the public will buy. But if you're a less 
high-powered writer, or a first-timer like Carr, then a far cleverer cover is 
required to create the sort of visual impression that can translate into 
big-time sales. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a publisher to do? Go all-out with a flashy dramatic scene rendered in 
picture-perfect detail? How about a subtler approach: grabbing attention 
through an eye-catching abstract design? Is it possible to strike some sort of 
balance, creating a cover image that's neither completely literal or entirely 
symbolic? "The Alienist" is one among several current novels that take this 
third route of the blur : soft focus tableaux, with semi-distinct figures posed 
in a way that seems to suggest the unfolding of a dramatic action. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an effect that's been used in everything from women's perfume ads 
("Anais, Anais") to the credit sequences of foreign films ("La Femme Infidele," 
"Les Biches"). Why shouldn't it work for literature? 
</P>
<P>
 The cover of "The Alienist" shows a caped figure walking down a 
turn-of-the-century city street. The image is an actual news photograph of the 
period, so it's perfectly in keeping with the tone of the novel, which centers 
on an investigation of a serial killer on the loose in New York in the early 
part of the century. The figure could be either the detective hero or the 
murderous villain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Profane Friendship," Harold Brodkey's novel about a furtive homosexual love 
affair, sports a blur cover that's less action-oriented. A man in a white shirt 
and dark tie stands in the foreground, while behind him a figure whose sex 
can't be precisely determined stands with its back to us, peering over a 
balcony. Because of the blur , exactly what's going on between the two figures 
is by no means clear. Still, it's a lot more festive than the cover of 
Brodkey's last book -- the recently remaindered "The Runaway Soul" -- whose 
stark blue lines gave it the less-than-inviting appearance of an accountant's 
ledger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lucky Town," author James Brown's study of a blue-collar father and son, 
takes the blur to its furthest extreme. The cityscape background of the cover 
can be made out well enough, but the figures in the foreground are faceless, 
undifferentiated blobs. It's as if we were peering through a lens of a movie 
camera that hadn't quite been pulled into focus. 
</P>
<P>
 What we're seeing in these covers isn't an organized whole, but rather one 
small part of a continuity of images, which only a reading of the novel itself 
can complete. Moreover, such literary completion is itself partial, for as with 
nearly every novel written today, there's a potential movie to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 That potential is about to be realized for "The Alienist," for producer Scott 
Rudin has snatched up the property for Paramount. This is scarcely surprising. 
After all, hasn't the cover provided the film with its opening shot?

ENDPAPERS: A WARDROBE FOR CYBERSPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tale is told of Pablo Picasso that as a small boy he had trouble with 
arithmetic because he could not stop himself from seeing numbers as small 
dancing figures.  
</P>
<P>
 A book designer must, like the boy Picasso, be temporarily (I stress) blind to 
the function of letters so as to feel the full force of their shapes and 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
 This seeing-by-not-seeing begins with the front face of the dust jacket, which 
is consciously designed as a mini-poster, but to a point the same process 
continues through the inside pages of a book. The difference is that though 
these pages, too, are poster-shaped, they are typically given only a simple, 
recurring, typographic design. This for two reasons: First, the principal 
function of interior design is not to startle and thereby attract a viewer but 
to assist someone who has already decided to read the book. Second, it is 
prohibitively expensive to treat each page in a book as if it were a separate 
work of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the computer, however, it is no longer necessary to stop where 
designers have been accustomed to stop. Start-to-finish, page-by-page design, 
if scarcely cheap, is no longer economically out of the question. It is now 
beginning to be economically feasible to change, from one page to the next, the 
size, face (shape) and even the color of the type; the size and shape of the 
"type page" or block of printed lines on a page; and the spacing or "leading" 
between the lines. A step beyond this already remarkable variability are such 
borrowings from avant-garde poster art as printing one line of type partly on 
top of another line or overlapping different exposures of the same photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these possibilities are on display in "Urban Revisions: Current 
Projects in the Public Realm" (MIT Press), a book designed by April Greiman 
Asssociates and published in conjunction with a recent exhibit by the same 
title at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. As a demonstration of 
newer book-design "special effects," the design of this book is a tour de 
force. Unfortunately, for the reader, it is the design equivalent of the 
theater of cruelty, an aggressive exercise in apparently deliberate 
user-unfriendliness. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy cover stock of the 9-by-12-inch paperback volume is beige. On its 
front face a 4 1/2-by-7-inch rectangle of tangled, mostly black-and-white lines 
lies atop a composition of gray, angular pencil lines and blotches of 
grayish-yellow color suggesting an architectural sketch. At the top, the words 
Urban, Re, Urban (again), Revisions, for the, visions , Current Projects, and 
Public Realm are printed in a montage of blue, magenta, vermilion and white at 
three different sizes with the letters slightly overlapping. Several lines of 
gray typescript smaller than the print on this page are printed atop those 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, to be sure, the urban terrain is a palimpsest upon which successive 
man-made landscapes have been "written" one atop the other. Conceptually, the 
palimpsest motif is not inappropriate for the cover of a work entitled "Urban 
Revisions" that presents a set of important civic renewal projects conceived 
for sites in the United States, Canada and Switzerland. But the illustrations 
chosen for the cover mini-poster of this book are precisely the kind that 
require completion by clear type. Because April Greiman's type is unclear, her 
illustrations end up announcing nothing. The mentioned rectangle of tangled 
lines appears on closer examination to be a somewhat fuzzy photograph of 
graffiti, but, displaced and decontextualized, it escapes quick recognition. A 
poster is a work of art that must first catch the eye, then convey information. 
The cover poster of this book does, at best, only half the job. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The user-unfriendliness of the cover is mild, however, by comparison with what 
awaits between the covers. The words of the inside title and subtitle are 
printed on two pages colored midnight blue from top to bottom. The title "Urban 
Revisions" appears in white against this blue background; the subtitle, 
"Current Projects for the Public Realm," appears in black, partly overlapping 
the title. These elements work well enough. Unfortunately, Greiman has 
aggressively crammed all the rest of the necessary title-page names -- those of 
the exhibit organizer, the volume editor, the five authors of contributed 
essays, the museum and the publisher into a tiny 2 1/2-inch square raft adrift 
in that sea of blue. Much of the type in the box is not just microscopic but 
microscopic and black . In black against the deep-blue background, the names of 
the contributors are so nearly invisible that I could only read them with a 
magnifying glass under a drawing-board spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothing designers often flout convention for the fun of it, and why not? If 
good taste dictates not mixing stripes and plaids, they mix stripes and plaids. 
If common sense dictates not wearing a vest with a cardigan sweater under a 
sports jacket, they gleefully combine all three, and a good time is had by all. 
Some conventions, however, have a strong functional rationale. Shoestrings are 
not tied together because no designer has yet found it amusing to break with 
the convention that the feet should be permitted to move independently. A 
comparable convention in book design is the one that stipulates that ink and 
paper should be in strongly contrasting colors. When Greiman, with her 
black-on-blue, flouts that convention, the reader pays the price. And 
unfortunately she flouts it repeatedly. A partially illegible title page and 
table of contents may be defensible, if just barely, but Greiman also forces 
the reader through long stretches of tiny light-green type on dark yellow 
paper. Roughly speaking, she reverses the proportions of type and space found 
in ordinarily legible printing, though her ratios, like the sizes of type she 
chooses, vary from page to page and even from paragraph to paragraph for no 
discernible reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Another book-design convention is that when a text has notes, they should 
either be accommodated as footnotes at the bottom of the pages or gathered as 
end notes at the back of the book. Greiman eschews both alternatives in favor 
of side notes -- marginalia, one might say, were it not for the fact that the 
space claimed for them is fully one third the width of the page. This width is 
large enough to accommodate occasional, rather brutally reduced illustrations, 
but as often as not there are no illustrations, and sometimes there are also no 
notes; the odd result, easily half the time, is a page whose left third is 
nearly or entirely empty, while its right two thirds are occupied by her faint, 
skinny, "spacy" lines of grayish-green type. (The empty third is indeed always 
the left third because Greiman spurns the symmetry convention that would place 
marginalia always on the outer margins.)  
</P>
<P>
 The comprehensive effect of this design is airy, open and pleasant -- until 
the moment when one attempts actual reading. At that point, the experience of 
reading "Urban Revisions" becomes like the experience of reading two hundred 
pages written by a person faint of heart but hard of pencil.  
</P>
<P>
 Still another book-design convention is that the table of contents should list 
or at least reliably guide the reader to all the contents of the book. Only 22 
projects were presented in the MOCA show. It would not have been difficult to 
list them all on a two-page table of contents immediately following the 
two-page title spread. Instead, what Greiman's table of contents does is direct 
the reader to Page 70, "Projects in the Exhibition." This direction would 
occasion no great inconvenience if the 22 projects were actually listed on that 
page, but in fact they are listed on Page 86, a page not mentioned on the table 
of contents. Between Page 70 and Page 86 come 16 pages of labeled but 
unexplained and virtually undecipherable color plates. The design of "Urban 
Revisions" recalls the tale of the sorcerer's apprentice. In that tale, the 
tool that began using its user was just a broom. In this design, it is a 
computer that seems to have run away with its user. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I do not mean to defend every aspect of old-fashioned book design, much less 
to attack computer-assisted book design as such. In "Imagologies: Media 
Philosophy," Marjaana Virta, Finland's "Graphics Designer of the Year" for 
1993, offers another example of front-to-back, page-by-page book design. In 
this design -- despite the fact that many a page functions dazzlingly well as a 
poster -- the whole remains perfectly legible at every point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagologies" grew out of a seminar team-taught by philosophers Mark C. Taylor 
of Williams College and Esa Saarinen of the University of Helsinki via 
cyberoptic (telephone-transmitted) television with the help of Compression 
Labs, Inc., of San Jose and Telecom Finland. Half the seminar sat in a row in 
Helsinki on one side of a virtual seminar table. The other half sat in a row in 
Williamstown on the other side of the table. The professors sat at the ends. 
The seminar, a weekly three-hour session, was conducted in real time: Everyone 
could see and hear everyone else. During the rest of the week, seminar members 
on either side of the Atlantic communicated with one another and with the two 
professors by Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the subject matter of the seminar, it is no slur to say that the 
seminar talked about itself. Thought is always affected by the means of its 
expression. How, the seminar asked, will Western thought be affected by the 
new, interactive and radically accelerated means of expression? The co-authors 
do their rather lighthearted, brainstorming best to "think along" with the 
exploding possibilities of cyberspace. Thus, in a section on cyberspace and 
economics, they write: "Postmodern art makes the disappearance of money appear" 
and "When the Big Board went electric, everything became lite." In a section on 
cyberspace and time they write: "In cyberspace speed transforms the meaning of 
the human race." 
</P>
<P>
 What designer Marjaana Virta attempts to do is "design along" with this madcap 
attempt to dance as fast as the technological music. Though her 
computer-assisted design changes with every page, her basic tactics are simple 
and inviting. The book is done entirely in black and white; and though every 
page is different, the elements that actually vary are few. What most 
differentiates Virta's design from Greiman's, however, is that even when a 
double- or triple-take is possible, the first take is always immediately 
legible. Virta's illustration for "telepolitics" consists of just one, 
immediately legible word. It happens, however, that that she has enlarged the o 
to the size of a black hole, suggesting, perhaps, the video grave into which 
all political energy seems to be sucked. In Virta's rendition of the "speed" 
aphorism quoted above, a broken circle of type imitates a stopped clock and 
suggests acceleration to sudden breakdown. Elsewhere, in a related vein, one of 
the authors writes: "I have now two phone lines coming to my house, two coming 
to my studio, a fax, a university number and an e-mail address, a pocket-size 
portable phone and a mobile phone in my car. Everyone says it's impossible to 
get hold of me." 
</P>
<P>
 In what must be a nearly unique bit of book-design spinoff, Virta's 
work-in-progress came to the attention of the famous Finnish textile company, 
Marimekko, which bought reproduction rights to several pages and has created a 
new cyberspace textile line, including pillowcases and bedsheets, wall 
hangings, wallpaper, clothbound notebooks, shirts, T-shirts, baseball caps and 
boxer shorts. The aphorism on a T-shirt is: "Understanding has become 
impossible because nothing stands under. Interstanding has become unavoidable 
because everything stands between." 
</P>
<P>
 Cyberbabble? Perhaps, but the jokes all have a point, and the designer has 
managed to create a look for this book as crazily, brainily playful as the text 
she was given. She did it by remembering that, for now at least, the computer 
is still a tool.

 ON A MISERABLY HOT JUNE AFTERNOON IN WASHINGTON, WHITE House staffers are 
putting the final touches on the President's much-hyped but long-delayed plan 
to "end welfare as we know it." And Republican operative William Kristol is 
tending his flock of Clinton opponents with calls to and from Capitol Hill.

 Right now Kristol is helping conservative legislators devise ways to deflate 
the soaring rhetoric that will invariably accompany the plan's unveiling. From 
Kristol's vantage, sowing seeds of doubt will require a disciplined plan: 
President Clinton's proposal to put more welfare mothers to work is precisely 
the kind of folderol the liberal media establishment likes to embrace.  
</P>
<P>
 Kristol, a 43-year-old former assistant professor from Harvard, was the brains 
behind Dan Quayle's family values campaign and broadside against Murphy Brown, 
TV's most popular unwed mom. Now, with the Republicans out of power, he's had 
the chutzpah to anoint himself guardian of the party's direction. All it took 
was a $1.3-million donation -- including contributions from flush New York 
investors -- a smart if youthful staff of 10 and a sign on the door proclaiming 
"Project for the Republican Future." 
</P>
<P>
 Phone in ear, voice in rapid-fire mode, Kristol urges his allies to stick with 
a clean line of attack: The President's welfare reform is a fraud, he counsels 
one congressman, better titled " save welfare as we know it." "If we think that 
Clinton's plan does not end welfare as we know it, that should be the simple 
message," Kristol explains between calls, as he describes the difficulties of 
keeping ambitious legislators focused on the big picture. "What happens is 
these guys tend to fall in love with their own proposals and hold long press 
conferences reminding everyone of their legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 Intellectuals such as Kristol, who are fashioning an updated version of 
American conservatism, see their key issue as welfare reform -- or, more 
broadly, reversing course in response to an increasingly violent and isolated 
underclass. That theme was snatched away by candidate Clinton during the 1992 
campaign, but now, in defeat, they want it back.  
</P>
<P>
 These thinkers insist that the GOP -- adrift since the fall of Communism and 
the mixed legacy of Reaganomics -- needs to fashion dramatic proposals for the 
nation's social woes that appeal to reason, not hostility. The words they 
return to again and again are virtue, citizenship, empowerment. The liberal 
experiment with the welfare state has failed, they say; it has broken families 
and sapped the spirit of those in poverty. Walk into any of Washington's more 
fashionable conservative think tanks these days, and you can hear the 
retro-cons making the case that they, not liberals, are the ones who care about 
the poor. In their view, the Great Society's hopes have dissolved into 
drug-infested communities full of fatherless children and violent streets taken 
over by rootless men. So it's compassionate, not heartless, they argue, to end 
the social-welfare programs that have left behind such human carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 Call them retro-conservatives. Like those in the neoconservative movement that 
preceded them, many retro-cons have traveled across the ideological spectrum 
from the left. But, taking their cues from an earlier age, they typically want 
to go even further to dismantle the welfare state and other government attempts 
to level the social playing field. Their mantra is the "little platoon" -- a 
term coined by 18th-Century British political writer Edmund Burke to describe 
the loose affiliations that human beings, left to their own devices, invariably 
form to take care of one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The retro-cons argue that those little platoons -- churches and schools, clubs 
and charitable associations, even unions and neighborhood activist groups that 
serve as moral standard-bearers and links to the broader community -- were 
undermined the minute Americans transferred their functions to the state. When 
impersonal government bureaucracies began taking responsibility for the care 
and feeding of the poor, modern Americans no longer needed to translate their 
idealistic compassion into action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compassion is always writ small, or it doesn't work," says leading retro-con 
William J. Bennett, who recently added a bestseller, "The Book of Virtues," to 
a resume that includes education secretary for Ronald Reagan and drug czar for 
George Bush. And "strongly bound communities, fulfilling complex public 
functions, are not creations of the state," adds his colleague Charles Murray, 
whose criticisms of the welfare state underpin the movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike mainstream Republicans, the retro-cons believe that federal social 
programs, ranging from student loans to food stamps, should be eliminated -- 
less because they tax our pocketbooks than because they tax our character. 
"There is a role for government," says Bennett. "But it has become the place of 
first resort for every problem. It has created discontent, whining, a habit of 
dependence. It seems to me we ought to devolve government, get (its functions) 
to the state level, the local level, to communities and non-government 
entities, and right on to the logical extension -- to the people themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a jarringly utopian vision of a complex, industrial and increasingly 
diverse America -- and the retro-cons often seem unable to make all the pieces 
fit. They are private-voucher advocates who typically send their own kids to 
public school but say poor black kids need to be saved from the state education 
system. They are worldly Ph.D's who don't care if gays and lesbians teach their 
kids, so long as they don't read "Heather Has Two Mommies" in class and don't 
demand civil-rights protection for their jobs. Retro-cons are mostly Jews and 
Catholics who vociferously defend the Christian right, even though the school 
prayer that the evangelicals promote won't be their own and even though the 
books some religious extremists want banned are central to the kind of 
well-rounded education they advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 The retro-cons derisively criticize the left's focus on the root causes of 
crime, yet they talk ad nauseam about the social pathologies wrought by the 
breakdown of the family. They reject immigrant-bashing: Kristol argues that 
American culture corrupts immigrant families, not the other way around.  
</P>
<P>
 But in their zest to reverse America's cultural slide, they often forget to 
talk about its parallel economic slide -- a steady decline in wages, rising 
multinational competition, a growing disparity between college graduates and 
high school dropouts. Their ideas are strangely devoid of focus on economic 
growth that has made the Republican Party so successful at the polls for the 
past two decades. Indeed, when one leading thinker, the Heritage Foundation's 
Stuart Butler, promotes tax cuts, he stresses that they are designed more to 
enable overworked parents to spend time with their children than to spur the 
economy.  
</P>
<P>
 Among these thinkers, Kristol, Bennett and Murray stand out for their ability 
to grab the megaphone and influence the debate from Washington: "The 
Bennett-Kristol-Murray axis is the strongest, most penetrating critique of 
Clintonism today," insists James P. Pinkerton, a conservative commentator and 
former White House official. "They're on to the big crisis, the rot and drift 
at the heart of American society. That's what people are most perplexed about." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristol, Bennett and Murray are all alumni of that hotbed of liberal elitism, 
Harvard. Kristol wore Spiro Agnew sweat shirts on campus, but Murray joined the 
Peace Corps and Bennett led a teach-in at Hattiesburg, Miss. A Jew from 
Manhattan, an Iowa-bred Presbyterian who frequents Quaker services and a 
Catholic from Brooklyn, respectively, all three of these men were academicians 
first, political players second. But all three seem to get a quiet thrill out 
of lobbing bombs into the political arena. They are contrarians with a cause.  
</P>
<P>
 TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS TRIO IS UPSETTING A delicate balance in the Washington 
welfare debate, it's necessary first to leave the stew of the capital city and 
drive 60 miles into the lush rolling hills of northern Maryland, through a tiny 
picturesque town of front-porch swings and brick sidewalks, to the house at the 
end of Main Street, where there's a tricycle in the dirt driveway, a pond in 
the back yard and a sign over Charles Murray's office door: "It's the 
government, stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine a spot more suitable for a man once made a social pariah 
by his writings linking welfare to rising out-of-wedlock birth rates -- and 
likely to be ostracized again this fall, when he and a co-author release a book 
that correlates a variety of social pathologies to low intelligence levels. 
It's also hard to imagine a more gentle figure as social outcast, as even his 
harshest critics will agree. This day he apologizes for a delayed phone call, 
for his fatigued appearance, for cutting the interview short as he prepares to 
leave for a European vacation.  
</P>
<P>
 Murray talks with the faux accent of a well-trained stage actor and bears a 
slight resemblance to "The World According to Garp" co-star John Lithgow. He's 
taller, tanner, more athletically built than suggested by those podium pictures 
from the endless array of welfare confabs he frequents, usually as the lone 
provocateur on a panel of liberal social scientists. Sitting in front of his 
Quadra 700 computer, he leans back, entwining his fingers, his gaze fixing on a 
distant point.  
</P>
<P>
 As much as any tract, it was "Losing Ground: American Social Policy 
1950-1980," Murray's 1984 critique of the welfare state, that drew the earliest 
broad outlines of the retro-cons' brand of conservatism. Grover Norquist, 
president of Americans for Tax Reform, explains Murray's influence best: 
"Murray has created the opportunity for conservatives, free marketers and small 
government advocates to have the moral high ground. He makes the case that the 
welfare state has been destructive of human life. . . . Murray is like Darwin 
or Freud or Marx. Once (that kind of thinker emerges), your whole analysis of 
the world shifts." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now Murray is trying to provide a shorthand summary of his argument 
linking welfare checks to the rise in fatherless babies. In "Losing Ground," he 
argued that the Great Society's buffers against the vagaries of life didn't do 
the poor any favors because they distorted incentive systems. By tracing the 
decisions of an invented couple, Phyllis and Harold, he attempted to show that 
after an accidental pregnancy in 1960, it made rational sense for the pair to 
marry and for Harold to secure a low-wage job. By 1970, it made more sense for 
Phyllis to remain single and collect welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 This "thought experiment" (a writing technique that Murray has raised to an 
art) prompted much ridicule among advocates of the poor, who derisively 
reported that they had yet to see teen-age girls calculating their welfare 
payments before deciding to get pregnant. Numerous social scientists still 
dispute the assertion that public assistance encourages unwed pregnancies, 
noting that illegitimate births have risen even as benefit levels have 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
 But Murray insists this is a simplistic understanding of his argument. He 
starts with the proposition that single mothers with small children are not an 
economically or socially viable unit. They suffer under enormous rates of 
poverty; a wide range of studies have found a higher incidence of crime, drug 
abuse, truancy and other problems among fatherless children. Public assistance, 
he contends, reduces the need for a wage-earning father, and it lets wayward 
fathers off the hook. Taken together, Murray argues, welfare checks, food 
stamps and housing subsidies -- an infusion of capital into desperately poor 
communities -- help reduce the social stigma that once accompanied unwed 
pregnancy.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you got rid of the welfare system, it would entail such a huge jolt -- to 
the economics, yes, but also to the milieu in which all these actions take 
place. So it would drastically reduce the number of kids born out of wedlock," 
Murray says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get the government to stop social engineering among people," 
he says, "to let civil society and the play of forces within civil society once 
again be the determining factors in how families are formed. Civil society will 
say very powerfully to children entering adolescence that sexual behavior must 
be confined within all sorts of penalties and rewards, and it's going to be the 
same kinds of penalties and rewards that mankind has used since Day 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray favors a program of phasing out welfare -- grandfathering those already 
in the system but saying to future young men and women: Don't expect any help 
from the government. Pregnant young women will have to rely on family, friends 
and, especially, the father. What about those who get pregnant anyway? 
Abortions may rise initially, he acknowledges. He also calls for easing 
restrictions on adoptions and says the government should spend lavishly on 
orphanages for unwanted or neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
 To critics who accuse him of wanting to break up families and leave children 
starving in the streets, he gave a blunt response in a recent TV interview: 
"Why is it cruel to have a change in a system which will vastly reduce the 
number of children being born into dreadful situations, dreadful, horrific 
situations?" 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's view of the world is largely shaped by six years in Thai villages 
during the 1960s, first as a Peace Corps volunteer and later as a field worker 
for a research institute. In writings and interviews, he returns time and again 
to the stability and harmony of poor Thai communities that survived on a 
fraction of the income provided by American welfare checks -- and displayed 
little interest in elaborate government projects.  
</P>
<P>
 But is it realistic to compare a rural Third World village to a city 
neighborhood under pressure from modern economic and social forces? When it 
comes to illegitimacy, for example, don't changes in sexual mores have as much 
to do with unwed mothers as welfare checks? "Two thoughts on that," he 
interjects. "If sexual liberation and sex-drenched TV and movies drive this so 
powerfully, why is it that rich kids don't have babies out of wedlock? They do 
have more than they used to, but they are still at very low levels. (About 44% 
of children born to poor white women are illegitimate, as opposed to 6% for 
white women above the poverty line, according to Murray's calculations.) So 
let's take whatever the increase has been among upper-middle-class youngsters 
and say, OK, there's (the impact of) your sex-drenched society on illegitimacy. 
How do you explain the rest over here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's argument focuses on this lower-class phenomenon -- out-of-wedlock 
births -- with nary a mention of the middle- and upper-class trend of high 
divorce rates. Murray himself is divorced. His first marriage, to a Thai woman 
and Fulbright scholar, produced two girls (both landed at Harvard). He later 
married Catherine Cox, the girl-next-door from his Iowa hometown, a professor 
and old family friend. They have two small children. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray says he has thought about studying the social impact of divorce. But, 
he argues, the repercussions of illegitimacy are more serious. "Divorce is bad 
for kids, but I think we can live with that problem." 
</P>
<P>
 MURRAY'S CAUTIOUS ACADEMIC DEMEANOR CAN BE misleading: In fact, this 
Midwestern son of a Maytag employee instinctively understands how to sell his 
ideas through the media. Like his counterparts in the retro-con troika, he has 
a flair for drama that appeals to pundits and to busy politicians in need of 
quick and vivid ways to pitch their ideas.  
</P>
<P>
 Murray describes himself as a wishy-washy libertarian who votes Republican 
only by default. But his welfare arguments are creating some uneasy splits 
inside the GOP. Ever since the 1970s, when Ronald Reagan took his 
welfare-queens-in-Cadillacs act on the road, Republicans have promoted a 
program of cost cuts, cleaning out the cheaters and forcing recipients to work. 
Now, a Democratic White House is proposing a plan to put most welfare 
recipients to work after just two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Murray's followers have shifted the debate further to the right, 
saying work isn't the answer, marriage is. Cost isn't the issue, illegitimacy 
is. Even the liberal establishment has begun fretting that 30% of births in 
this country are to unwed mothers. Last year, the influential Atlantic Monthly, 
a standard-bearer for liberal academia, ran a cover story on the sorry state of 
fatherless children under the provocative title "Dan Quayle Was Right." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, those worries remained background noise inside the Republican Party 
until last October, when Murray used the Wall Street Journal's influential 
opinion pages to warn that rising illegitimacy rates among poor whites were 
leading to the creation of a "white underclass." "The white underclass will 
begin to show its face in isolated ways," Murray ominously wrote. "Look for 
certain schools . . . to get a reputation as being unteachable. . . . Talk to 
the police; listen for stories about white neighborhoods where the incidence of 
domestic disputes and casual violence has been shooting up. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's piece did more than simply remind Capitol Hill of his arguments 
linking welfare with births to unwed mothers just as welfare was coming up for 
debate. He also single-handedly gave conservatives cover on the race issue. In 
the past, talk of illegitimate births has had racial overtones, because rates 
are three times higher among blacks than whites. But when Murray asserted that 
policy-makers should be just as worried about rising birth rates among 
unmarried poor white women, the issue became safer to discuss, and the 
mainstream media leaped to attention.  
</P>
<P>
 For weeks after it appeared, "The Coming White Underclass" served as column 
fodder for some of the chattering class's most influential commentators -- 
George F. Will, Charles Krauthammer, U.S. News' Michael Barone and John Leo, 
Newsweek's Joe Klein. The TV networks also jumped on the bandwagon, with David 
Brinkley, Connie Chung and "20-20's" John Stossel handing the mike to Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by the intense media attention, Murray, Bennett and Kristol met during 
Christmas week to discuss how to transform ideas into policy. They concluded 
that the major Republican welfare legislation now pending in Congress -- a 
painstaking effort that took the GOP leadership months to produce -- was too 
timid. So Bennett and his colleague Peter Wehner wrote opinion pieces pushing 
Murray's view for USA Today and 25 major newspapers. Bennett also talked about 
welfare reform in speeches and appearances on his good friend Rush Limbaugh's 
show, among others.  
</P>
<P>
 By early spring, any ambitious legislator looking around for a way to make a 
name couldn't help but embrace Murray's analysis. And two did: Republicans Jan 
Meyers of Kansas and James M. Talent of Missouri. The Republican bill that most 
GOP legislators originally backed suddenly had competition. "I'm definitely 
getting my right side beaten in," moaned Pennsylvania Rep. Rick Santorum, the 
House's lead legislator on the first Republican bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Talent's bill, in particular, was causing headaches for Republican leadership. 
The 37-year-old freshman member of Congress says he's convinced Murray's ideas 
caught fire for two reasons: They were being pushed by Bennett and Murray 
rather than harsh right-wing voices such as Pat Buchanan or Jesse Helms, and 
they had at least partial endorsement from a Democratic President. "I'm a great 
believer that ideas have consequences," says Talent, who requires his interns 
to include "Losing Ground" among their library of conservative readings. "And 
the welfare system defines the values of our nation. . . . (Welfare recipients) 
are not categories, they are real people. And they are a lot smarter making 
decisions for themselves than you are for them."  
</P>
<P>
 As spring wore on, Bennett threw his weight behind the Talent bill and went on 
the attack against Santorum's legislation. In April, his think tank, Empower 
America, released a memorandum condemning the majority-Republican approach and 
proposing Murray-like solutions in its place. By mid-June, as the debate 
intensified and opposition began to mobilize, welfare had become as much 
Bennett's baby as Murray's. 
</P>
<P>
 BENNETT WAS HIMSELF the product of a broken home. He and his brother Robert, 
now a Democratic lawyer who is defending President Clinton in a sexual 
harassment suit, grew up in Brooklyn, rarely seeing their father except on 
weekends. Bill was only 5 when his parents divorced, and 46 years later, this 
man of many words runs short of them when describing those years. "I don't know 
how it affected (my life)," he says. "All I know is that my brother and me 
both, we put a big premium on family. We both carve out time, and I think Bob 
and I want to keep our families close, our marriages together." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, a potential candidate for the GOP's presidential nomination in 1996 
and the best-known of the retro-cons, is a big bear of a man who has trouble 
completing a thought without quoting either a Greek philosopher or a Founding 
Father. He spent long years in academia -- an undergraduate degree from 
Williams College, a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Texas, a 
Harvard law degree -- and it shows. Bennett's enemies describe him as pompous, 
bombastic, a legend in his own mind.  
</P>
<P>
 There is certainly a healthy dose of egoism in Bennett's character. But two 
hours into this interview, one has to wonder how much of these trappings are 
the facade of a slightly insecure but basically warm man -- an exponent of 
virtue who's quick to point out his own foibles, a family-values crusader who 
readily pokes fun at his own parenting of two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old Bennett once played rhythm guitar in a band, and his earliest 
claim to fame was a blind date with Janis Joplin, a story that briefly came 
back to haunt him when Bush nominated him as drug czar. He remains a '50s-'60s 
brand of rock fan, distraught over the "steep moral slide from Bach, and even 
Buddy Holly, to Guns N' Roses and 2 Live Crew."  
</P>
<P>
 That about sums up his view of American society as well. In many ways, 
Bennett's theme is a broader one than Murray's, but it's also one less easily 
addressed through government policy, for his is the message of cultural 
decline. "There is a coarseness, a callousness, a cynicism, a banality and a 
vulgarity to our time," he said in one speech. "There are just too many signs 
of de-civilization -- that is, civilization gone rotten." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett documented America's decline in one book, the 1993 "Index of Leading 
Cultural Indicators," which, like its economic counterpart, used numbers to 
document the country's health. No surprise there: While government spending and 
the gross domestic product have shot up since 1960, so have violent crime (a 
560% increase, by Bennett's calculations), the rate of illegitimate births (up 
400%), divorces (up 400%) and the teen suicide rate (up 200%).  
</P>
<P>
 That was followed by the more uplifting "Book of Virtues," an 800-page 
compendium of classic children's tales and reading. In this new work, Bennett 
has done the Republican Party a huge favor by secularizing the values debate, 
taking it out of the realm of the Christian right and broadening its appeal -- 
a significant task after a display of mean-spirited "family values" talk during 
the 1992 GOP convention left many mainstream followers shaken. It's difficult 
for anyone -- liberal or conservative, religious or not -- to argue with the 
"virtues" extolled here: friendship, loyalty, compassion, courage, faith, 
self-discipline, responsibility, honesty and perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, he notes in the introduction, is designed for "the moral education" 
of our young. Explaining that he purposely ignored such modern political issues 
as abortion and nuclear war, Bennett writes: "Good people -- people of 
character and moral literacy -- can be conservative, and good people can be 
liberal." Bennett makes an effort at a diverse cultural mix, offering such 
traditional fare as "Jack and the Beanstalk" (demonstrating the virtue of 
courage) alongside a North American Indian tale (honesty) and Martin Luther 
King Jr.'s "Letter From a Birmingham City Jail" (responsibility). 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, King remains one of Bennett's heroes, and while he contends that in 
the 1990s the federal government has overstepped its role, Bennett continues to 
believe it acted properly in clamping down on segregationist states during the 
1960s battles over civil rights. "You had a situation where people's rights 
were being violated," says Bennett, who was active in the civil rights movement 
as a teacher at the University of Southern Mississippi. "King said, 'Look, it's 
higher law. . . .' The genius of King was that he always relied on mainstream 
American documents."  
</P>
<P>
 Bennett was a Democrat and president of the National Humanities Center in 
North Carolina when the Reagan Administration -- at the behest of the Bradley 
Foundation's Michael S. Joyce and Irving Kristol (father of Bill) -- came to 
call, offering him the chairmanship of the National Endowment for the 
Humanities. He slipped comfortably into the role of Republican spokesman, 
changing parties and later using the offices of secretary of education and then 
drug czar as bully pulpits for his conservative causes. Much of the education 
establishment still reviles him for his attacks on schools and, at the other 
end of the spectrum, GOP loyalists criticize him for talking a good game 
without fulfilling some of their key promises. "We don't need intellectual 
arguments to close down the Department of Education," complains GOP lobbyist 
David M. Carmen. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of Republicans also question the virtues of a man who changed his 
mind about accepting the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee, in 
part because he didn't want to give up lucrative speaking fees. Bennett insists 
this was only one factor and notes that he was in a financial bind, having to 
pay back the advance on a book he hadn't written. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, with fellow conservatives Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin 
Weber, Bennett formed Empower America. The idea was to provide fresh thinking 
for the Republican Party, but any attempt at innovation got a late start 
because of bickering between the Kemp and Bennett forces over the think tank's 
direction and by the disgruntlement of a principal financial backer. The 
original $150,000 salaries collected by Bennett and Weber led some GOP-ites to 
complain that Empower America was "the best-funded speakers' bureau in 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, Bennett's tendency to speak in grand philosophical sweeps rather 
than policy details makes him a compelling political figure. "Bill loves 
novels, and I think he understands that life is a narrative," says Peter 
Wehner, Empower America's policy director. "That's what a lot of political 
figures can't do." But on specifics, which he'll have to address if he makes an 
admittedly unconventional bid for the GOP presidential nomination, Bennett can 
be infuriatingly astral. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to clearly delineate his view of the federal government's role, 
Bennett can't help himself: He starts with the Federalist Papers. "It's No. 3, 
right?" he asks Wehner before moving on. "John Jay says that security is the 
first object of government. I think people expect the government to protect 
their livelihood, their property, their lives. The great drama of the L.A. 
riots was that people were seeing the fundamental terms of the social contract 
up for grabs. People are not supposed to defend their stores and their lives on 
their own."  
</P>
<P>
 Asked to talk about government spending -- and which parts to eliminate -- 
Bennett is hard to pin down: "How do you know when there's too much federal 
government? Through judgment and common sense. First and foremost is its effect 
on the character of the people. The test of any regime is what kind of people 
it produces. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of this year's GOP congressional candidates have latched onto a 
Bennett-esque virtues theme. It is, says Jeffrey Bell, author of the book 
"Populism and Elitism: Politics in the Age of Equality," a way of filling a 
void. "Right now the Republican Party is in sad shape when it comes to 
developing an agenda," he says. "We've decided all it takes is to be 
non-Clinton to win, which is probably true short-term: We can get by with no 
agenda in '94. But congressional elections and presidential elections run on 
separate tracks. For all of Clinton's problems, Republicans are not leading 
Clinton (in polls), especially when Perot is thrown in."  
</P>
<P>
 So far, three probable Republican candidates for the 1996 presidential 
election -- Dole, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Texas Sen. Phil Gramm 
-- are mostly ignoring the retro-con message. Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar 
Alexander has shown some interest, but Kemp has signed off on some of the ideas 
while carefully distancing himself from others. The real test of how many 
voters are drawn to these themes would be a Bennett candidacy in which he tries 
to reach out to moderates while holding on to support within the religious 
right.  
</P>
<P>
 The retro-cons' experience in floating their welfare-reform ideas earlier this 
year offers other cautions. In the predictable cycles of Washington news, this 
season's genius is likely to become next season's exile. So by spring, the 
town's love affair with Murray's ideas was already cooling. Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan said Murray's prescriptions would provoke "scenes of social trauma 
such as we haven't known since the cholera epidemic." A Washington Post 
editorial attacked Bennett, Kristol and Murray, saying Murray's "solution looks 
an awful lot like giving up on the problem. It reflects too much eagerness to 
take risks with the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in society." In 
June, a group of 76 social scientists signed a statement disputing Murray's 
research.  
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, and largely out of the spotlight, however, Bill Kristol, the third 
leg of the retro-con axis, was speaking to a less critical audience. 
</P>
<P>
 HOW DELIGHTFULLY DEVILISH that the conservative movement's most skilled 
assailant on the cultural elite is himself its son. Kristol grew up on 
Manhattan's West Side, his father the Trotskyite-turned-neoconservative hero, 
Irving Kristol, and his mother the prominent Columbia University historian 
Gertrude Himmelfarb. Kristol once told an interviewer that he grew up harboring 
the "typical New York-Jewish view of the world, that people who weren't from 
New York and Jewish were unfortunate: They ate Wonder bread and mayonnaise and 
had boring existences." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he came to Washington to serve as Bennett's chief of staff at 
Education, his credentials included a Harvard Ph.D. in political science and 
teaching experience at both the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard. He 
caught on to the political game fast, rigorously adhering to the cardinal rule 
of successful Washington conservatives: You can bash the liberal media 
establishment all you want -- as long as you return their phone calls. While 
his next boss, Dan Quayle, was hooted in the press, Kristol was hailed as the 
intellectual who trained the vice president to quote Plato and the Talmud. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristol was considered brainy and politically astute enough to informally 
advise President Bush's staff as well. Out of power, his knowing wit continues 
to play well on the insiders' talk-show circuit: CNN's "Crossfire" and "Inside 
Politics" and CBS' "Face the Nation."  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Bennett, Kristol speaks best to a small circle, boiling big thoughts 
down to a few words. His winning gimmick, hands down, has been his series of 
"private" memoranda on GOP strategy, regularly faxed to Republican leaders and 
about 300 of Kristol's best friends in the media.  
</P>
<P>
 Through last spring and summer, Kristol conducted a series of morning synods 
on the state of the GOP. These 90-minute debate sessions, drawing upward of 200 
mostly youthful party followers on busy weekday mornings, transformed Kristol's 
own shop into the hippest hangout in town for the brand of Republican prone to 
quoting Edmund Burke. But plenty of old-line Republicans continue to grumble 
about these brazen displays of the party's internal splits, while others 
dismiss the meetings as the "Kristol-for-White-House-chief-of-staff campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristol has a reputation for arrogance, which is interesting because he also 
has a habit of muttering self-deprecating asides in between his fast-paced 
sentences. Short, with permanently knit eyebrows that give him the aura of a 
caring rabbi, he is not a man who works well in crowds. He's at his best 
one-on-one, behind-the-scenes, orchestrating rather than pontificating. 
</P>
<P>
 He clearly relishes the role of contrarian; his favorite college sport at 
Harvard was championing Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War. "Ah, the bombing of 
Haiphong, the greatest moment in an American modern presidency," he says with a 
laugh. Twenty years later, Kristol leads a fairly placid life: long hours at 
work, marriage to former classics professor Susan Sheinberg and three small 
children in Virginia's public schools.  
</P>
<P>
 If Kristol could put his politics on a bumper sticker, it would read: "The 
politics of liberty and the sociology of virtue." "Politically," he says, "our 
emphasis should be on liberty, on cutting back government. Then the issue of 
virtue and character can be addressed through (private) social and civic 
institutions."  
</P>
<P>
 The liberty and virtue stuff plays well in the pages of conservative journals. 
But when Kristol talks to Washington, his language is that of raw political 
strategy. He's best known for his lobbying on the health-care debate, using his 
private-memo network to push the line that "there is no health-care crisis."  
</P>
<P>
 He has also used that network to chide Republicans for pursuing an empty 
"politics of scandal," focusing on Clinton's personal foibles rather than 
promoting ideas. And he's attempted to carve out a more moderate abortion 
plank, saying the GOP should rely on "an extensive and ongoing process of 
public persuasion" rather than pushing for a federal ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he unstintingly defends the religious right. "There has to be some 
education of the so-called Christian right," he concedes when asked about the 
group's extremists. "But there also has to be education of the people who are 
intolerant of the Christian right in the name of tolerance, who don't like them 
because they're strange or aren't part of the same social class." He opposes 
rightist attempts to ban classic literature, but, he asks, "is it a threat to 
civil liberties if the citizens in one town foolishly decide they want to 
remove 'Catcher in the Rye' from the bookshelves?" 
</P>
<P>
 As far as welfare is concerned, Kristol believes that private efforts such as 
a teen abstinence support group founded by Bennett's wife, Elayne, will reduce 
births to unwed mothers as much as cutting off welfare payments. Still, behind 
the scenes, Kristol has played a crucial role in translating Murray's ideas 
into plans for political action. By the time Tuesday, June 14, rolls around -- 
D-Day for the Clinton welfare plan -- he is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 IT'S THE SECOND WEEK OF June, and Kristol is still trying to persuade his 
allies to set aside any deep analysis of the welfare state in favor of giving 
good quote. His Monday, June 13, memo to Republican leaders features an 
eye-catching Moynihan phrase -- "boob bait for the Bubbas" -- to make the 
argument that Clinton always pulls welfare reform out of the hat when he's 
having trouble in the polls.  
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the White House releases its welfare-reform plan, and Kristol 
helps orchestrate a Capitol Hill press conference featuring Bennett and key 
supporters in the House and Senate. As the cameras roll and the pens scrawl, 
the bromides fly. "Marginal tinkering." "An all-too-typical Clinton promise." 
"Half joke-half fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 By midweek, the Kristol-Bennett media assault is in full force. The media, 
which pushed the retro-cons' earlier welfare-reform ideas through the cycle of 
embrace-reject-forget, now welcome them back -- this time as the necessary, if 
predictable, voices of opposition in the day's debate. Bennett makes the 
evening news and readies for a round on CNN's "Capitol Gang." Kristol faces off 
with a Democrat on CNN's "Inside Politics." Newspapers run excerpts from 
Kristol's "boob bait" memo, while Empower America launches radio ads denouncing 
Clinton's welfare proposal as "cynical and deceptive."  
</P>
<P>
 The capper to the weeklong media assault looks like it will happen Sunday, 
when Bennett is invited to debate Clinton Health and Human Services Secretary 
Donna Shalala on CBS' Sunday morning show "Face the Nation."  
</P>
<P>
 The debate never happens. 
</P>
<P>
 This was to be the week when the nation engaged in a candid discussion about 
the pernicious effects of government giveaways on the poor, about the 
importance of enterprise and the dangers of dependence. Instead, a very 
different view of America's moral decay emerges, one that's closer to home. On 
Friday night, as millions of viewers sit tube-side, accused murderer and 
wife-beater O.J. Simpson takes a fleet of police cars on a tour of the L.A. 
freeway system. Along the way, fans cheer him as if he were back at USC, 
sweeping through the Bruin defense on an 80-yard touchdown run.  
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone need a more potent vision of cultural decline? This may be the 
decade of consensus that the welfare state isn't working, even, perhaps, that 
it undermines a sense of personal responsibility. But it's also the decade of 
Damian Monroe Williams, acquitted of attempted murder for beating truck driver 
Reginald Denny; of the Menendez brothers, portrayed as the victims of the 
parents they brutally murdered; of Tonya Harding, rewarded with celebrity 
status and a movie deal for her involvement in an assault on a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't need to be Lou Harris to understand that Americans are deeply 
troubled by the state of their society. They tell each other, and the 
pollsters, that they are more troubled by the nation's moral climate than its 
economic strains. But are these Americans concerned about the fatherless 
children in the ghettos or the fatherless children of divorce in their own 
neighborhoods? Or both? Are they more worried about sex education in the 
schools or Madonna grabbing her crotch on MTV? Do Americans really buy the 
argument that chopping government off at the knees will lead to national 
spiritual renewal, a fresh sense of personal responsibility?  
</P>
<P>
 "People are hungering for some sort of moral order," says conservative writer 
Pinkerton. "On the other hand, people don't like to be lectured to." Especially 
by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 When the sun rises that Sunday morning, Bennett does make an appearance on 
"Face the Nation," but by then the subject has shifted from welfare to the 
Simpson case and the public's reaction. Americans, Bennett suggests, are 
confusing "real heroism with celebrity." Five days later, Bennett tells Larry 
King's CNN audience that the Simpson episode suggests America is witnessing an 
"escape from the idea of personal responsibility, which is not only at the 
heart of our law, our criminal justice system, it's at the heart of our 
civilization." 
</P>
<P>
 "What afflicts us," Bennett recently lectured, "is a corruption of the heart, 
a turning away in the soul. Our aspirations, our affections and our desires are 
turned toward the wrong things. And only when we turn them toward the right 
things -- toward enduring, noble, spiritual things -- will things get better."  
</P>
<P>
 The retro-cons have convinced themselves that cutting government and 
encouraging Burke's "little platoons" will help return our aspirations to 
things enduring and noble. Retro-con Michael Joyce, president and CEO of 
Milwaukee's Bradley Foundation, argues that Americans "are eager to seize 
control of their lives . . . to assume once again the status of proud, 
independent, self-governing citizens intended for them by the Founding 
Fathers." That's a big leap back from the 1990s welfare state. Now all the 
retro-cons have to do is convince a public that is angrily cynical about 
American government -- but also avidly addicted to its inherent promise to make 
life for all just a little bit better.; ;

THE GOOD SOLDIER; AS THE MILITARY DOWNSIZES, THE WAR-HARDENED VIETNAM 
GENERATION IS RETIRING, INCLUDING ARMY LEGEND ALFRED BAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, A former Mideast correspondent for the Sunday Times of London, 
Robin Wright covers global affairs out of The Times' Washington bureau. Her 
last article was about Tajikistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the summer of 1969, Alfred M. Baker was blown up by a satchel full of Viet 
Cong explosives. The explosion threw Baker 20 feet into air; the impact broke 
his back in two places, ripped off almost half his face and snapped bones all 
over his body. Medics deposited him in the triage section for those left to 
die. Before a priest began giving him last rites, Baker managed to clear away 
the teeth and bits of gum knocked into his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get the f--- away," he mumbled to the priest. "I'm not Catholic. And I'm not 
going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker was awarded a Purple Heart. It was his fourth in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 And Vietnam marked only the early phase of Baker's career. Later assignments 
-- including two "black book" posts delegated by the secretary of the Army -- 
were just as dangerous and often more challenging. Yet no assignment, Baker 
contends, has been as painful as his post as chief of staff, U.S. Command, 
Berlin Brigade. Next month, he will oversee the closing of the only U.S. base 
behind enemy lines, ending a half-century-old American presence in a city that 
symbolized the Cold War. And as he turns off the lights of the headquarters 
built for Nazi Field Marshal Hermann Goring, Baker will also end a three-decade 
career.  
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, this has been the toughest assignment I've ever had. It's 
saying goodby to a city and a mission that has played such a role in history. 
It feels like amputating your own leg," Col. Baker, 53, reflected recently in 
the cavernous office that once served the Luftwaffe . "Plus the whole 
kaleidoscope of what I've done and all I've been for 30 years ends here. This 
is the last stop. There is no more." 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Berlin Brigade and the cashiering of one of the Army's most 
decorated soldiers are microcosms of the changes within the American military 
during the final phases of its massive drawdown. Their last days symbolize the 
passing of a certain kind of mythic American soldier and an ambitious mission 
that first led the United States to international power. The result is 
transforming the U.S. Armed Forces.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, more than half the 1,669 U.S. military 
facilities overseas have been eliminated, reduced or inactivated -- just short 
of the 54% reduction of 1990 levels expected by 1996. More than 600 were in 
Germany. And since the height of the U.S. deployment in 1987, more than 200,000 
of the half-million soldiers overseas have been reassigned to home bases, left 
the military or retired. The overall goal is a 56% reduction of 1985 levels by 
1996; the largest drawdown is again in Germany. From more than 250,000 troops 
in 1987, the U.S. presence will be reduced to less than 100,000 soldiers after 
cutbacks culminating with the deactivation of the Berlin Brigade.  
</P>
<P>
 Like Baker, many of those affected by the cutbacks in posts and personnel are 
the most war-hardened officers still serving in the military. Due to either 
time, notably the 30-year career limit, or the new streamlined military, many 
who cut their teeth in the foxholes, marshes and jungles of South Vietnam are 
now being retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is one of the Army's contemporary legends. 
</P>
<P>
 IT TOOK MORE THAN 15 OPERATIONS TO PUT Baker back together; he underwent 10 
just to reconstruct his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I had looked like Rock Hudson. They obviously screwed up," he 
laughed. The only visible reminder of Vietnam is a lump on his upper right lip, 
which he opted to keep rather than undergo more surgery.  
</P>
<P>
 As a professional soldier, Baker didn't take a military discharge. Eighteen 
months later, he was back in Vietnam. During his third tour, he worked under 
John Paul Vann, the acclaimed but controversial military maverick dissected in 
Neil Sheehan's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, "A Bright Shining Lie." It was 
a turning point in Baker's life.  
</P>
<P>
 Vann appraised the Saigon government early on as corrupt and inept. He 
understood the war was being lost among the peasantry, and he knew high-tech 
weapons were often producing more guerrillas than they killed. After failing to 
win promotion and thus forced out of the Army, Vann returned to Vietnam as a 
civilian adviser and architect of a different strategy to counter the Viet 
Cong. His eight-man teams, culled from the diplomatic, intelligence and 
military communities, worked on a U.S. program advising villagers at the 
grass-roots level on economic, political, agricultural and health issues. Baker 
became one of Vann's boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, colleagues referred to Baker's final tour in Vietnam as his Col. 
Kurtz period, after the officer played by Marlon Brando in "Apocalypse Now" who 
pursued the war on his own terms. Shortly after Baker arrived in the jungles 
and rice paddies of remote Phu-Yen Province, he dismissed the other seven 
members of his team. "They were the wrong people in the wrong place doing the 
wrong jobs. It wasn't their fault," Baker explained. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 19 months, he lived mostly alone, moving among the villages to 
work on their problems. "I thought if I was going to get them to follow my 
advice, I had to live like they did," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I went on operations with the local Vietnamese home guard to show we were 
confident of their security. I slept in villages to show we weren't afraid to 
live alongside them in exposed areas. I worked on problems of rats and 
agriculture to prove we were interested in their lives. And I spent a lot of 
time drinking tea and talking about what concerned them. Every two months I 
went into town to get rip-roaring drunk, then I came back and lived like a 
Buddhist monk, never raising my voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," he stressed, "I never went native." During that last year in Vietnam, 
however, the 6-foot-1 Baker dropped to 135 pounds from 170. 
</P>
<P>
 Vann was a role model for Baker. Their lives took similar turns. After World 
War II, Vann, a Southerner, pulled himself out of poverty through the Army. 
Baker grew up on a farm near a West Virginia coal camp; his father worked for 
the railroad. He joined the Army because "the military represented the prospect 
of a middle-class life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vann excelled rapidly in the Army. He distinguished himself in combat during 
the Korean and Vietnam wars, although his heroics led to tales of recklessness 
as well as valor. He also spoke his mind and rarely hesitated to take on the 
military brass, often drawing awe from troops but disapproval from superiors. 
The combination ultimately cost him a general's star. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker also rose rapidly through the ranks; he was a major within seven years 
of his first commission. Soldiers who knew him in those early years remember 
archetypal blood-and-guts prowess. "He was a tremendous hunter, a natural 
hunter. That's why he was so good in combat," recalled Everett Thomas, who went 
through Ranger and Airborne training with Baker in 1963.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Purple Hearts, Baker also won two Bronze Stars, a Silver Star 
medal, two Legion of Merit awards and an Air Medal in Vietnam. He is "either 
the luckiest or unluckiest soldier I've ever known. Al Baker should have died a 
couple of times. But he was just too tough and too stubborn," said Lt. Col. Jay 
Erb, who is now at the Pentagon.  
</P>
<P>
 Flamboyant and funny, with a propensity to break into nasal renditions of 
country and Western songs, Baker sees himself as an outsider. Officers who have 
served with him on four continents speak of Baker in almost adoring terms. But 
he'll also leave the Army short of a general's star, despite interventions by 
military peers.  
</P>
<P>
 "My way of thinking is different to almost everyone else in the officer corps. 
It often puts me out of step," Baker said.  
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam's climax, however, had a vastly different impact on Vann and Baker. 
Vann's ambitions ultimately undid him. His criticism of U.S. strategy softened; 
his hawkish actions hardened. Obsessed with victory as proof of America's 
rightness, he began to let the ends justify the means. And as that victory 
proved ever more elusive, he called for air strikes and even boasted of the 
smell of dead bodies wafting in from nearby jungles after their hits. Vann died 
in a 1972 plane crash during a North Vietnamese offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Baker was one of many officers who, angered by the American 
experience in Vietnam, became wary of war. "During the first two tours, I had 
one job," Baker said. "It was to seek out the enemy and destroy him. That was 
my mind-set and that's what I did. During the last tour, I began to understand 
we weren't going to be able to win. And I began to see why."  
</P>
<P>
 One of Vietnam's most potent legacies was a generation of officers reluctant 
to engage militarily without clear goals and support from well-defined policy 
and the public. Without all three, many in this generation became gun-shy, 
sometimes reluctant to use force or even prepared to speak out against it. Many 
were outraged as the U.S. military was subsequently burned again by policy in 
places such as Beirut and Somalia; others urged the White House to think 
through its goals before taking on Iraq.  
</P>
<P>
 Baker came out of Vietnam transformed -- as his family quickly noticed. 
Haunted by his friendship with a 12-year-old Vietnamese boy, Baker once went 
home on leave to find his children's bikes unused because they had flat tires. 
"They were waiting for me to fix them. They wouldn't do it themselves," he 
said. "So I took all the bikes down to the thrift shop. It wasn't fair to my 
own children. But I was living shoulder-to-shoulder with people struggling to 
survive. One of them was a little kid getting up in the morning and working and 
then going to school and coming back to work. So the piling up of possessions 
seemed irrelevant. I didn't want them to possess my family." 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't changed. When they leave Berlin, the Bakers have no home to return 
to in the United States. His wife, Joan, has put bids to buy much of the 
furniture in their Army-supplied home in Berlin for "whatever we end up in 
wherever that turns out to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Vietnam, Baker has also never personally owned a gun. He concluded that 
there were different ways to wage and win a war. And firepower, he decided, had 
its limitations. Once again, it goes back to Vann. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vann's idea was not to fight on a military basis. You had to offer people a 
better alternative, to show they could make government better without taking up 
arms. So the idea was to rebuild a nation from the grass roots up. It was a 
beautiful concept," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Vietnam, Baker's foreign postings reflected a determination to do right 
what Vann had failed to do in Vietnam. Baker hasn't always succeeded. But he 
often made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE 1980S, AS THE MIDDLE EAST REPLACED VIETNAM AS THE LEADING hot spot, 
Baker landed in Lebanon and found his life increasingly embroiled in the 
world's longest ongoing conflict. In 1981, he was first assigned to work for 
the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), which monitored 
tension between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Baker headed UNTSO's mission in 
Lebanon -- at the time, the region's most explosive border. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chances of being killed randomly were incredibly high," Baker laughed. 
"There wasn't just one war going on. We were tracking 80-odd groups and trying 
to referee all their fights." Among them were Christian and Muslim rivals 
fighting a civil war, Palestinian groups in and outside the PLO challenging 
Israel, and foreign-sponsored militias, from Kurds to Libyan surrogates, 
playing out regional tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission, which forbade U.N. observers from carrying arms, was to get the 
PLO and pro-Israel militias to honor the latest of many truces since UNTSO went 
to work in 1948. Both militias were resisting deployment of U.N. observers to 
monitor their activities. 
</P>
<P>
 To build relations with the PLO, Baker took his bedroll to a PLO guerrilla 
camp -- contact banned by U.S. law, but allowed while he worked for the United 
Nations. After a dinner of rice stew, he listened late into the night as they 
talked about their cause and their lives. He then slept among them under the 
stars. Over time, he persuaded the PLO to let U.N. troops deploy at Beaufort 
Castle, the 12th-Century fort on the hills leading to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 He then trekked across the front line to the Christian militia, an Israeli 
surrogate force based as a buffer inside the Lebanese border. "I told them it 
was a shame that they were losing business to the PLO, because the U.N. wives 
were shopping every Sunday in (PLO-dominated) Tyre, where they felt safe 
because of the U.N. presence. I told them I'd like to throw some business their 
way," he said, chuckling at the memory of his guile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, there was nothing to buy there, but I brought the wives along and told 
them to buy whatever they could. They were dutiful and pulled out $100 bills. 
Within two weeks we could drive wherever we wanted. The U.N. finally had access 
to the town," he added, chuckling again. The peacekeepers were thus deployed in 
the rivals' two most strategic bases.  
</P>
<P>
 Compared to progress on Mideast peace in the 1990s, Baker's achievements in 
the 1980s seem minor. Yet each marked a breakthrough. And not all who held the 
yearlong position were as successful. A predecessor was kidnaped by 
Palestinians. A successor, Lt. Col. William Richard Higgins, was abducted by 
Muslim extremists and died in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baker was able to do things that were almost impossible, that other people 
could only dream about, real miracles," said Herman Kafura, an American who 
served with Baker in UNTSO. "He would talk to people and make sense to them. 
They trusted him." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Baker returned to Lebanon a second time, as chief of the Office of 
Military Cooperation, a so-called black book post because of its sensitivity. 
His mandate was to revamp and retrain Lebanon's army as the basis for 
rebuilding the fractured state. But he arrived just three days before a suicide 
bomber drove into the U.S. Marine barracks, killing 241. From then on, the U.S. 
presence was in retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Unprotected by the barricades or military backup afforded Marine peacekeepers, 
Baker quickly became the most exposed American soldier in Beirut. Within one 
24-hour period in 1984, his car and apartment were hit by militia rockets and 
artillery. When he was forced to camp out on a cot at the Defense Ministry, an 
explosion then blew out a wall of windows above his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember looking in on him to see if he was hurt," said Alex Franco, chief 
of operations. "The blanket over him, all the furniture and the floor were 
completely covered with glass. Baker peeked out from under the blanket, looked 
at me and said, deadpan, 'Next time I think I'll ask for a room without a 
view.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After the Marines finally sailed away in early 1984, Baker and his crew, who 
operated independently, remained behind. When the second U.S. Embassy was blown 
up that September, Baker was widely recognized as one of the heroes for 
rescuing the wounded and then operating a makeshift American mission. But by 
the end of 1984, most of the key American players were gone. U.S. diplomacy had 
failed to bring Lebanon's warlords together; the political chasm actually 
deepened, throwing the battered country into a new round of violence. 
Throughout those three years, the only partial U.S. success was the Lebanese 
Army, traditionally dominated by minority Christians.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baker understood what the policy types didn't: that he had to establish 
circumstances in which Christians and Muslims were equal, that he couldn't let 
them stall or argue about change. That new reality was supposed to create a new 
instrument for stability," said Robert d'Entremont, Baker's second-in-command.  
</P>
<P>
 Baker coaxed, cajoled and prodded Lebanon's foot soldiers as well as their 
generals to coexist. After Beirut's Shiite areas became dangerous for 
Americans, he met with the army's Shiite leadership on their turf to discuss 
grievances. He then held the hands of nervous Christian generals, while pushing 
them to remove inequities toward Muslim troops, including uneven distribution 
of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was good at building coalitions among factions. Sometimes he did it by 
sheer force of personality. He was always walking a tightrope, but somehow he 
made it work," D'Entremont said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under U.S. direction, Lebanon's army brigades, once divided by religious 
affiliation, were integrated for the first time. The process was slow, and many 
Shiite Muslims split after warfare resumed. But then they laid down their arms, 
refusing to fight other parts of the army -- leaving it to the militias. Before 
they left, more than 50 Shiite officers individually contacted Baker to say 
they were still committed to a unified army, but that they couldn't turn their 
backs on Shiites under bombardment by a renegade Christian army unit. Today, as 
Lebanon is finally at peace, the seeds of that army program are again the basis 
for reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Baker left in late 1984, the Lebanese president awarded him the Order 
of Cedars, one of the country's highest honors. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Vietnam, Baker unexpectedly went back a third time, in 1988, as chief of 
staff of the Sinai Force, the multinational peacekeepers set up by the Camp 
David accords between Israel and Egypt. In his second black book post, Baker 
finally got to practice the theme increasingly running through his life: how to 
get people to do things to overcome hatred and injustice by means other than 
force. He made a deep impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never forget when he invited me for a drive from Israel to Egypt. As 
we drove across the Sinai and later went horseback-riding among the pyramids, I 
learned more from him about the Middle East in that short time than I could 
have in a university," said Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, now chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, under whom Baker served three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He understood the smells and sounds of the region -- and the challenges and 
opportunities. Regrettably, guys like Al Baker don't come around often. He's 
more in tune with today's challenges than half the generals walking around." 
</P>
<P>
 BAKER'S CAREER WILL END WHERE IT STARTED -- IN BERLIN. Shortly after the Wall 
went up and the Berlin Brigade was formed in the early 1960s, Baker was a young 
lieutenant often assigned to patrol East Berlin.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was like looking into day on one side and night on the other, like living 
in sunshine while looking into a storm," he recalled. "As I drove around, 
people would sometimes signal, 'Don't forget us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now Berlin, Los Angeles' sister city, is preparing again to be the capital of 
a unified Germany. A key step is removal of all foreign forces, including the 
historic Berlin Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he returned as chief of staff in 1990, Baker has orchestrated its 
dismantling -- an operation equivalent to closing down a city of 16,000, 
including dispatching almost 7,000 troops, their dependents and local 
employees. He's also disposed of or transferred $5 billion worth of property, 
from tanks to elementary schools and hospitals, from 40,000 dining room chairs 
to three libraries with 400,000 books. 
</P>
<P>
 The job ends Sept. 7, when the U.S. flag is taken down from the old Nazi 
headquarters, a daily ritual known as the retreat. This ceremony is called the 
final retreat, after which all flags and references to the Berlin Brigade will 
officially end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take great pride in the fact we finished our mission here, that a threat is 
over and we are able to end an era," he reflected. "But you have to be careful 
about having your dreams come true." He leaves Berlin without a job, facing an 
uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, it's an anticlimactic finish. "This is an odd way to end my 
career. I'm used to hot spots," Baker said. "It's quieter than I would have 
liked." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in other ways, Berlin may be appropriate. During the past three decades, a 
U.S. account of the Berlin Brigade concludes: "Probably no force of its size in 
history has contributed more to peace, stability and freedom in the world." 
Yet, it adds, "the Berlin Brigade has never had to fire a shot in anger."

A FATHER'S CRUSADE; EIGHT YEARS AFTER A CHP OFFICER MURDERED HIS DAUGHTER, SAM 
KNOTT IS STILL TRYING TO CHILDPROOF THE WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SALERNO, Steve Salerno is a San Diego-based journalist now working on 
a book about a murder for hire. His last story for the magazine was Weekend at 
Camp Sell-a-Lot, on new sales training techniques. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At about 9:45 p.m. on a Saturday, two nights past the Christmas of 1986, Sam 
and Joyce Knott were seized by a living nightmare without pity or precedent. 
Their 20-year-old daughter, Cara, was guiding her white VW Bug along Interstate 
15, San Diego's interior freeway, back to her home in El Cajon. She had just 
spent two days in Escondido playing nursemaid to her boyfriend, Wayne Bautista, 
who was ill with the flu. Her trip should have taken 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego State honor student was eager to get home -- newlywed older 
sister Cindy and husband Bill were temporarily living with Cara and her 
parents. A second older sister, Cheryl, was also at home, and brother John, the 
"baby," was spending his first holiday season home after heading off to 
college. Cara and Cheryl had commiserated over the fact that this might well be 
"the last of the Great Knott Family Christmases," shindigs locally famous for 
their elaborate staging and panache. 
</P>
<P>
 Cara had phoned Sam and Joyce a little after 8 let them know she was leaving. 
Cara always phoned; it was a lesson Sam had drummed into his daughter since her 
earliest days behind the wheel. Thus when she failed to show up by 9:45, an 
alarm bell went off inside him. 
</P>
<P>
 He had Cheryl alert police agencies, then organized a search party, employing 
the meticulous attention to detail that had made him successful as both a 
hospital administrator and, more recently, investment counselor. Through the 
wee hours and into the frigid dawn, the family members drove, crisscrossing the 
two freeways Cara always took on her trip. They checked each exit, peering 
through the webby fog that had strung itself like a series of tennis nets 
between the rocky hills framing the roads. When that proved fruitless, they 
expanded their search to adjacent parks and mini-malls. Nothing. Sam Knott came 
home briefly to make more calls to the police and was stunned by the 
dispatchers' lack of interest. The responses he got varied from the glib 
("girls will be girls") to the insolent ("If I had a dollar for every call I 
got about a missing person, I could retire"). 
</P>
<P>
 At sunup, Cindy and Bill made their second pass at an exit just north of Mira 
Mesa, the approximate midpoint of Cara's journey. They had given it short 
shrift the first time around because the off-ramp led only to roads then under 
construction. But there, in a small dirt cul-de-sac far from the reassuring 
bustle of the freeway, Cindy Knott and Bill Weick found Cara's abandoned VW. 
Looking up, they noted the sign above the exit: Mercy Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple promptly phoned the San Diego Police Department; the cops took 40 
minutes to show up, with Sam in hot pursuit. Leaning on his Olds Cutlass, Sam 
Knott watched one of the officers walk to the middle of the bridge that 
traversed a 65-foot canyon. He saw the young policeman glance down and 
hurriedly motion to a comrade. For a moment, the two officers conferred. Then 
they returned to their patrol car, opened the trunk and pulled on surgical 
gloves. It was an image that required no explaining, an image Sam knew, in that 
moment, he would never be able to purge from his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 At the base of the craggy canyon lay Cara Knott. It was later determined that 
she had been incapacitated with a terrible blow to her forehead, then strangled 
with a rope and dumped over the steep side of the freeway access road. "She 
looked," as one officer put it, "like a frozen Milky Way that's been slammed 
against a table." 
</P>
<P>
 The murder of the All-American girl was the lead item in Sunday's newscasts. 
The next evening, in an effort to calm female motorists, the California Highway 
Patrol agreed to provide viewers with a primer in highway safety. To do the 
ride-along segment, they tabbed an oft-commended 13-year-veteran, Craig Alan 
Peyer, who had served as the department's de facto media rep on previous 
occasions. It was only fitting that Peyer do the piece anyway, as the crime had 
occurred on his beat. 
</P>
<P>
 In his solemn, resonant voice, Peyer warned female motorists to "stay in your 
vehicle and lock all doors. Even if you have to wait all night, it's better to 
be in the safety of your vehicle than to try to walk and get assistance. 
Anything can happen. Being a female, you can be raped, robbed, all the way to 
where you could be killed." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the case twisted into the realm of soap opera. By the dozens, 
young women across San Diego began picking up their phones to report odd 
nighttime encounters with a CHP officer at Mercy Road; a couple of the calls 
came to Sam Knott. The women told of being detained by this officer, in the 
foreboding stillness beneath I-15, for up to 90 minutes. During these 
interludes he engaged them in "general chit-chat" (as one detainee phrased it) 
that bore scant relevance to minor equipment infractions for which they 
supposedly were stopped. Many of the women resembled Cara. Almost all of them 
drove small cars. A few of them owned Cara Knott's exact model VW. 
</P>
<P>
 An after-hours search of the officer's patrol car yielded a damning length of 
rope. A check of his duty log revealed a stark absence of activity during the 
period when Cara had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 15, Officer Craig Peyer, the Border Division's star officer and 
sometime safety spokesman, was arrested and charged with the murder of Cara 
Knott. After two trials (the first ended in a hung jury), Peyer was found 
guilty in June, 1988, making him the only CHP officer ever convicted of 
committing a first-degree homicide while on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Knott had been having trouble enough forgiving law enforcement agencies 
for their inaction on the night of Cara's disappearance. The arrest of a police 
officer was a horror that tore at the faith of a man brought up to believe that 
life worked in an orderly, righteous manner. In the end, the men and women who 
promised to protect and serve had done neither. 
</P>
<P>
 Drifting between anguish and rage, Sam began making inquiries of his own. The 
deeper he got into official procedures and protocols, the more clearly he saw 
the flaws that culminated in his daughter's brutal death. He gathered his 
family around him and told them, "We are going to change the system, so maybe 
this will never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 As he had done on the night of Cara's disappearance, Sam took charge: He and 
his family would become the agents of change in an indifferent society. He 
would put himself before anyone who would listen, write letters to police 
chiefs and the president. He would let nothing stop him, not the searing pain 
of two tense criminal trials, not the ignominy of having to put a dollar value 
to his daughter's life in his civil suit against the state. 
</P>
<P>
 More than seven years later, Sam remains faithful to the oath he swore on 
Cara's behalf. Though his actions have caused laws to be changed and policies 
revised, there are other laws and other policies that still need changing if 
Sam is to realize his vision of safer freeways and more accountable police. And 
if the circumstances of his daughter's death showed him anything, it was that 
he could trust no one else to do what needed to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the criminal trial, the jury's responsibility was to determine whether The 
Monster was the perpetrator. . . . It is possible, for example, that the jury 
concluded that regardless how Cara arrived at the bottom of the Mercy Road 
off-ramp, The Monster was the one who killed her, based on physical evidence 
linking The Monster to Cara and based on The Monster's conduct after the 
killing." 
</P>
<P>
 The name Peyer does not pass Sam Knott's lips. Ever. In talking, in testifying 
-- even this day at a San Diego Denny's, Sam substitutes "The Monster" each 
time he comes across the offending word. He does it matter-of-factly, without 
special emphasis, exactly as if The Monster were Craig Peyer's given name. 
"It's part of my therapy," he explains, but it's more than that: It's an 
expression of Sam's allegorical world view. There are monsters out there. And 
one must be ever vigilant, take every precaution and then some or the monsters 
will overcome the forces of good. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely among the latter group was Cara Knott. By all accounts, she was the 
kind of kid who, in the course of a week, might finish first at a track meet, 
then visit a neighborhood kid who wasn't feeling well, then stop by the local 
senior citizens center, then attend a rally on behalf of an endangered species. 
"Her name means precious, and she was," says Jaime Bautista, the man who might 
have become her father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam took great pains to indoctrinate his youngest daughter in the ground rules 
of a precarious world. "That's the overriding tragedy in this tragedy," notes 
Paul Pfingst, the prosecutor who secured Peyer's conviction. "Here's a girl who 
did everything right. And she ends up getting killed by a cop." 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the central irony in Sam's liability suit against the state. Filed 
initially in August, 1987, the suit seeks to hold the CHP and the state liable 
for his daughter's death. Having made the usual rounds of the judicial system, 
it is now pending in California Supreme Court; oral arguments should be under 
way by fall. If the court rules in Knott's favor, it could have a seismic 
impact on the question of municipal liability for misdeeds by public employees 
and on the state's right to offer testimony during civil proceedings that 
contradicts testimony in earlier criminal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil suit is one of Sam's two most high-profile crusades. The other -- 
installation of an automated tracking system to keep tabs on police officers -- 
is fraught with controversy. Together, the two pursuits command as much as 
three days out of each Sam Knott week. Because of such absorption, the years 
have changed him. The gray hair is thinner, the face fleshier; the shoulders 
seem less chiseled than the set that carried the Knott family through two 
grueling criminal trials of 1988. Hip replacement surgery has left the 
56-year-old with a noticeable hobble that, in another man, might serve as 
metaphor for what he's been through. But the handshake is unyielding, the 
familiar azure eyes are no less so. That much has not changed: When Sam Knott 
looks at you, you do not look away. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is that gravelly voice, adding a distinct macho bite to the nonstop 
philosophizing for which he is known. The effect of the eyes and voice working 
in concert can be downright chilling. As the waitress hands him his iced tea, 
Sam smiles warmly and thanks her; then the smile abruptly wilts as he puts down 
the glass, fixes his interviewer with that stare, pulls his lips tight against 
his teeth and snarls: "It's more functional, if you want to take the moral high 
ground, to get your hands on the system than on The Monster' even though you 
have all these human elements that want to get their hands on The Monster." 
</P>
<P>
 In the earliest days after the murder, an understandably shaky Sam had yet to 
find his true agenda, so he ran on instinct, mounting a scattershot 
counterattack against the seemingly gratuitous pain victims were forced to 
suffer in the aftermath of such a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuming over the perfunctory handling given the Knotts' pleas for help on the 
night of Cara's disappearance, Sam paid a visit to San Diego Police Chief Bill 
Kolender shortly after the murder. "Nobody will take a report," Sam told him. 
"They just turn you away. And they're not even polite about it." Wryly, he 
added, "If someone takes your car or your purse, the police jump in 
immediately. But if your daughter turns up missing . . . ." Kolender agreed to 
prevail upon his missing-persons unit to be more sensitive in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 A CalTrans official remembers Sam storming into his office "a week or so" 
after the murder, saying, "We have to close that exit. It's a hot spot for 
druggies and rapists. It's unlit. It's unsafe. It leads nowhere.' " Throughout 
the meeting, Sam maintained his trademark eye contact and spoke with a 
conviction that left the functionary thinking, I guess this is just how things 
are gonna be. The exit got shut down within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam had little time to savor such victories. Everywhere he turned, he saw 
opportunities for his "revictimization." On Feb. 5, 1987, he picked up his 
morning copy of the San Diego Union to find a grim Page One account of Cara's 
autopsy. Most of this information had been kept from Sam, and as he pored 
through the account detailing the crushed bones and ruptured organs, he was 
overcome. Not just with grief, but fury. How could the coroner's office put 
this sort of information on 250,000 San Diego doorsteps without first giving at 
least a courtesy notification to the immediate family?  
</P>
<P>
 He drafted a letter to Brian Bilbray, chairman of the County Board of 
Supervisors, asking his cooperation in bringing about a "more dignified and 
civilized" procedure "so that other victims' families will not have to endure 
this outrage." The policy was promptly changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't delegate any of this," Sam is saying while his sandwich and fries 
grow cold. "You think you can but you can't. Oh, there's plenty of people 
who'll ostensibly get behind you and say 'great idea.' It's like the first guy 
through the barricade: Everybody's yelling 'Yeah, go ahead, go get 'em!' But 
they're yelling this from behind the barricade." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam is relentless. Sam is thorough. Sam is unstoppable," says San Diego Mayor 
Susan Golding, who has found herself across a table from him on various 
occasions since 1987, when she was a county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Relentless. Hearing of a plan to plea-bargain the case down to second-degree 
murder, Sam began making regular visits to the court building. Prosecutor 
Joseph Van Orshoven and District Attorney Ed Miller would look out into the 
corridor and there was Sam, a subtle, often silent reminder of their duty, 
writing poems to his fallen daughter. "If you're physically there," Sam 
explains, "it becomes 'What do we do with this guy?' " What Miller and Van 
Orshoven did was go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorough. The hung jury left Sam so frustrated that he had seven jurors come 
over the house for his own private debriefing on their deliberations. "You'd 
think the D.A.'s office would have done this," he says, "but they never did." 
Armed with that information and his own list of the prosecutor's evidentiary 
oversights and tactical foul-ups, Sam persuaded new prosecutor Paul Pfingst to 
open a pipeline between the Knotts and the D.A.'s office, and the two men 
shared ideas on everything down to the placement of court exhibits. "Sam was 
probably the most involved victim I've ever encountered," recalls Richard D. 
Huffman, the judge who presided over both trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Unstoppable. In 1987, Dr. Carole Jenny, then affiliated with the Sexual 
Assault Center at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center, told Sam that she'd been 
trying for almost two years to get the government to fund her research on DNA 
typing. So Sam Knott spearheaded the nation's first federal grant for a 
university forensics lab specializing in DNA analysis. He methodically worked 
the Washington bureaucracy until he found the individual responsible for 
shepherding such grants through the system. Sam told the man, "I need this 
technology for the blood evidence against The Monster that murdered my 
daughter. Let me bring my family to Washington to plead my case." He didn't 
have to leave El Cajon. The grant to the Sexual Assault Center was approved 
Oct. 1, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Family observers add another word: retentive. Of an incident that took place 
six years ago, he will say, "I went up there on a Friday, it was about 2:15.," 
As his sister, Jean Thompson, once remarked, "Whatever you do, don't lie to 
him, because he'll remember what you told him the first time, and he'll catch 
you up." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam's remarkable memory gives his words an immediacy that belies the fact that 
Cara's death took place two presidential Administrations ago. When he leans 
back in his seat at Denny's to describe the climax of his all-night search for 
Cara, his gaze moves off to some distant point, his voice slows from its 
customary staccato to a hypnotic monotone, and one senses that he is actually 
back there, reliving it all for the thousandth time: "After eight, nine hours 
on the road, I'm on the west side of I-15, on Penasquitos Boulevard. So here's 
Penasquitos, and I'm coming along the side road and it's just before 6 o'clock 
and I see this black-and-white come racing down the road. So I chase after it, 
I'm right on his bumper flashing my lights and he gets right on the freeway 
then gets right off here at Mercy Road." 
</P>
<P>
 In the months after the murder, detectives noted that Sam would talk to Cara 
as if she were standing beside him. For Sam Knott, the hands of time remain 
forever frozen at 8:30 a.m. Dec. 28, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 18 months it took to convict Craig Peyer, the Knotts had put their 
lives on hold. Sam worked sporadically if at all. Joyce went on leave from her 
post as a hospital nutritionist. Cindy and John took time off from school. 
Cheryl, the family firebrand, stayed close to San Diego, a major concession for 
someone who on any given day was likely as not to turn up at some archeological 
dig in Borneo. 
</P>
<P>
 For Joyce and the rest of the family, Peyer's conviction and 25-year-to-life 
prison sentence ended -- or at least resolved -- a horrific chapter in their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sam, the end of the criminal trial merely freed up his calendar for the 
burgeoning slate of initiatives that has begun making increasing demands on his 
time in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Larry Stirling. The La Mesa Assemblyman had been deeply moved by his 
constituent's plight, and as an architect of the city's police dispatch system, 
he was shocked at the way it let the Knotts down. "The police had always had 
this policy of waiting 48 hours before getting involved in a missing-persons 
case," says Stirling, now a judge. "The theory was that 70% of the kids are 
found within 48 hours. But what about the other 30%?" 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1987, Stirling invited Sam to come to Sacramento. The Knott family 
looked on stoically as Stirling recounted their story to the Assembly, then led 
his colleagues through a brief ceremony in Cara's honor. 
</P>
<P>
 The session produced two landmark laws. One effected a major tactical shift, 
elevating missing-persons reports to a priority status above crimes against 
property. It also mandated training to improve the handling and routing of such 
calls. The second bill required the Highway Patrol to respond to calls, like 
the Knotts', that clearly fall within its jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathering steam, the Knott-Stirling juggernaut rolled on to another of Sam's 
pet peeves: bail. Sam had been horrified when Peyer was set free on $1-million 
bail. He and Stirling brainstormed the first state law compelling judges to 
consider public safety in setting bail. "Crazy as it sounds," says Stirling, 
"in the past, defendants even in murder cases could get low bail simply because 
they'd kept all their previous court appointments." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam was no less dismayed when Peyer was declared a legal indigent, entitling 
him to no-cost legal representation. Craig Peyer's quarter-million-dollar house 
was not counted in reckoning his assets for purposes of declaring him indigent. 
Sam wanted real property to be taken into account when determining eligibility 
for free representation. It took a year before such a measure was passed, by 
which time the question had become moot for the Knotts -- Peyer was already on 
trial, his high-gloss, court-appointed legal team at his side -- but Sam got 
his wish. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam eventually wrote poems lionizing Stirling for his role in the flurry of 
new legislation, but looking back, the ex-lawmaker gives Sam all the credit: 
"His leadership, his strength so galvanized everybody in Sacramento that it was 
like a bright shining light. It became undeniable that these things had to be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there could be no dismissing the fruits of his "Sacramento phase," 
Sam remained troubled. Missing-persons laws were unlikely to abort a tragic 
episode in real time. He returned to an idea that had began to take shape in 
Sam's mind within days of Cara's murder, when he heard from a young woman who'd 
been stopped by Peyer at Mercy Road. Sam got to thinking: What sort of system 
was in place to make sure officers were where they were supposed to be, doing 
what they were supposed to be doing? 
</P>
<P>
 He found that although officers were obliged to report in at regular 
intervals, and had to maintain a log -- "8:10-8:22, removing boxes from the 
freeway" -- there was no objective means of tracking them.  
</P>
<P>
 "UPS knows where your package is," quips Sam, "but the police, they don't know 
where their police officer is." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam raised the issue with anyone who would listen. He told Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor and her successor, Golding. He told San Diego Sheriff Jim Roache. He 
told then-Sen. Pete Wilson. He told the County Board of Supervisors, long and 
often. More recently, he told Bill Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
 "What people don't realize is, basically the system is already in place," he 
says, referring to the $8-billion global positioning satellites launched by the 
Pentagon to coordinate troop movements and now in perpetual orbit about the 
globe. Sam envisions a system in which a device mounted in law-enforcement 
vehicles would bounce a signal off a satellite to a central tracking station, 
pinpointing the location of every car at every moment. "They're up there, 
they're paid for, they're waiting to be used. It's a no-brainer." He says he 
has even offered to install a pilot program at his own expense. No takers thus 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 But evidence from the scattered tracking applications that do exist suggests 
that they might not be the panacea Sam envisions. "He gets a little 
over-enthusiastic sometimes," says commander Gene Norden of the Irvine Police 
Department, whose tracking system was on-line almost a year before the murder. 
"He'll have people call me so we can tell them what our program is about. He's 
extremely high on it -- maybe too high, thinking it does things it doesn't do." 
Norton doubts that the Irvine system would have made a difference in Cara's 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Former CHP Border Division Chief Ben Killingsworth claims he actually began 
investigating tracking before Cara was killed, and concluded that the 
less-sophisticated tracking systems then available would not work very well in 
hilly San Diego. But "you couldn't tell that to Sam," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the CHP experimented with satellite tracking in 1993, deputy 
commissioner Dwight Hemick admitted that the system was being field-tested in 
San Diego "in deference to Sam's concerns." And in June, Sam's seven-year pitch 
to the Board of Supervisors paid its first dividends. The board voted to 
explore funding for an omnibus $80-million radio-communications package linking 
all local law enforcement and fire agencies -- a package that includes a 
vehicle tracking system. 
</P>
<P>
 Activism among so-called "homicide survivors" -- the oxymoronic phrase used to 
refer to the families of murder victims -- is nothing new. After the savage 
murder of her daughter Sharon, the late Doris Tate founded an an influential 
crime-victims advocacy group. Candy Lightner's rage over her daughter's death 
at the hands of a habitual drunk driver evolved into Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving, whose effect on the national attitude toward drunk driving has been 
incalculable. The harrowing abduction-murder of John Walsh's young son, Adam, 
catapulted Walsh to media celebrity, which he used as a platform for critiquing 
society's haphazard approach to locating missing children.  
</P>
<P>
 But few people acting without the the backing of an organized group have 
attacked the system with the blunderbuss vigor of Sam Knott. In large part, Sam 
has created his causes and brought them to critical mass on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion is divided on the health of Sam's crusade. Stirling believes that if 
Sam is overbearing at times, he's entitled. "The scope of (the Knotts' tragedy) 
was a tremendous underlining of the incompetence of the system. They had to 
find the body themselves. Then they had to show the prosecutor how to 
prosecute. There's no reason for a stockbroker to have to interview a jury and 
write a cookbook to show the D.A. what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "The general public would like to believe that when somebody is murdered, we 
read about it in the newspaper, then it's over," says Mike Mantell, chief 
psychologist with the San Diego police during the Peyer trial, and now in 
private practice working with trauma victims. "It's wishful thinking on our 
parts that when the lights and the cameras and reporters go away the victims 
put things back together. Well, that's just not the case. For many people the 
loss is a tear in the heart that just never ever mends."  
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that Sam's crusades have been universally well received. 
Law enforcement insiders say the new missing-persons laws impose demands on the 
911 system that dilute manpower and force officers to respond to calls that 
seldom merit a dispatcher's time. The tracking issue, too, has been denounced 
as fundamentally misguided. Critics argue that notwithstanding the grimness of 
the Knotts' experience, police as a class are the last people parents need to 
worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that almost from that fateful Sunday morning, Sam Knott has been 
attempting to create a legislative and electronic cradle: Missing persons laws 
that deliver your errant children safely back to your arms within hours. Cosmic 
surveillance that keeps deviant cops away from them. Lights and sensors 
everywhere so that nothing sinister can happen in shadows. " If you can't keep 
your children warm and safe in their beds forever, you do the next-best thing: 
child - proof the world. "  
</P>
<P>
 By whatever means necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 CAUTIOUSLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE LONG-RANGE PROSPECTS FOR TRACKING, Sam has 
turned his thinking to the civil suit. Early in 1991, a jury found for the 
Knotts, awarding $7.5 million in damages, but it became a hollow victory as 
Superior Court Judge James R. Milliken effectively dismissed the Highway Patrol 
from the suit, ruling that the state could be found liable only if Peyer killed 
Cara in the course of his regular duties. That ruling theoretically leaves 
Peyer, now broke and in prison, liable for the whole multimillion-dollar award. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, that fall, came the ground-breaking resolution of a nine-year court 
battle in the case of Mary M. v the City of Los Angeles. Raped by an on-duty 
LAPD officer in 1981, she sought to get the city to pay damages. The case went 
to the California Supreme Court, which found for the plaintiff. Justice Joyce 
L. Kennard wrote, "When law enforcement officers abuse their authority by 
committing crimes against members of the community, they violate public trust. 
The public employer must be held accountable for their actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Knott attorney Forrest A. Hainline III went to the Supreme Court hoping to 
have the Mary M. ruling applied to the Peyer suit. The state counterattacked 
vigorously by seeking the right to amend or even repudiate certain testimony of 
CHP officials and others during the two criminal trials. The testimony in 
question concerns the state's prior knowledge of Peyer's habits, the danger 
posed by the Mercy Road exit and the issue of whether Peyer was still acting 
under the auspices of the CHP when he killed Cara. As Hainline puts it, "The 
state argued that the rope Peyer killed her with wasn't a CHP-issue rope, so 
maybe the state should not be liable. " 
</P>
<P>
 The court may order the state to honor the civil jury's $7.5 million verdict. 
Or it may send the case back for retrial. Or -- Hainline's greatest fear -- it 
may even overturn its own prior ruling on Mary M. "I'm cautiously optimistic," 
says Sam, "but then I've been optimistic all my life, and, well, we've seen 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Hainline finds it astonishing that Sam has held up as well as he has through 
the ups and downs of litigation, of hearing the facts of his daughter's death 
recited again and again. and reaffirmed again. "I don't know how he bears it -- 
and with grace, no less. You have to think all this would have killed any other 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam admits that his crusade has taken a toll on the family finances. He also 
concedes that Joyce is worried about him, that though she once supported him in 
his victims' work and even took on a few projects herself, she has come to feel 
that it's time for him to move on. "She's felt that way for a long time now. A 
long time. Most of what I do is very difficult for her, because she came from a 
situation where you don't rock the boat. Meanwhile, I'm inside the boat, 
throwing furniture off!" 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Sam thinks maybe she is right, certainly his battle against the 
forces of evil has exacted its toll on their finances. But there is just so 
much left to do. 
</P>
<P>
 His list of causes is almost endless. He hopes to make society stop 
romanticizing murderers and to heighten public awareness of those left behind. 
Toward that end, he distributes $1,000 scholarships in his daughter's name 
through the Cara Knott Foundation. "Everybody can name five monsters, but they 
can't name five victims," says Sam. "Meanwhile, all this time, money and energy 
goes into the appeal process and protecting the killer's constitutional 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 It galls Sam that Cara's assassin is accorded conjugal visits with wife Karen. 
"The Monster gets three days and two nights," he says in a sing-song parody of 
a travel brochure. "Isn't that nice? A little vacation from the drudgery of 
prison." His eyes harden and his voice, suddenly, is ice-cold. "And we pay for 
all this." 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to retrofit freeway call boxes with beacon lights, fog sensors that 
alert the CHP to dangerous conditions and other high-tech bells and whistles to 
improve highway safety. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been acting as an aide-de-camp to other victims, notably Marc Klaas, 
father of Polly, whose abduction-murder in October, 1993, sparked nationwide 
outrage. "The system broke down again," says Sam, shaking his head. What time 
he has left, he devotes to the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau, which pushes 
for legislative change and helps survivors cope and marshal resources for the 
killers' parole hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam is already composing a mental agenda for the year 2005, when Peyer becomes 
eligible for parole. "You have to get the prosecutor there, prepare evidence -- 
relive the heartache all over again. It's an enormous undertaking in time, 
money and emotion. "People say, The Monster got a life sentence. They don't 
realize it's a life sentence for us, too."

 Back in the days when children were seen and not heard, few grown-ups asked 
tots for their views on design. Most schoolrooms came in two shades -- 
jailhouse brown and hospital green -- and were as square and spare as offices. 
Playgrounds, too, were businesslike, with rows of swings and slides in sandlots 
and asphalt jungles. Wherever they were -- home, school, park or doctor's 
office -- kids often found themselves in a one-size-fits-all junior version of 
Adultland. 
</P>
<P>
 The current child-care explosion has changed that, and so have concerns about 
children's safety and research into how and when youngsters start to learn. 
Older parents, who've had more time to develop strong opinions about their 
kids' needs, have also had an impact, prompting educators, corporations and 
design professionals to rethink the child-size scene. 
</P>
<P>
 What they're coming up with are age-specific and developmentally appropriate 
environments, says Beth Reeves Fortney, an Arcadia design and child development 
consultant. "Children aren't just little adults," she explains. "They have 
different needs, fears and interests, which design elements can address." 
</P>
<P>
 While visual stimulation and interactive qualities are important in a young 
person's space, so is flexibility, she adds. "They need a place that isn't so 
overdesigned that they can't make it their own." 
</P>
<P>
 As these pages show, kids' settings can reflect the energy and exuberance of a 
child's-eye view and please parents who might have grown up hungry for color.

 Tomatoes, sunflowers, herbs and squash grow behind George Washington 
Elementary School in Burbank. Soon, two bridges will arch across a dry stream 
bed nearby. An amphitheater, a picnic area, corn patch and native-plant 
collection will take shape too. This playful yet practical mix -- known as an 
environmental science park -- is aimed at inspiring youngsters to respect Earth 
and enlivening the curriculum through hands-on education. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the North Hollywood-based nonprofit foundation Alliance for 
Children's Trust, the project has pooled the talents of landscape 
professionals, students, teachers, parents and the community. Joining the 
effort about a year ago, Achva Stein, an associate professor of landscape 
architecture at USC, enlisted her students to develop plans for the site. 
Washington students then critiqued these ideas and proposed their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children want a place that means something and doesn't just look good," says 
Stein, a partner in BLS Environmental Design in Los Feliz. "They want an 
element of fantasy, something they can relate to their own dreams and stories." 
Many suggested richly experiential details such as the dry stream bed and 
bridges.  
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, says Kreigh Hampel, an environmental educator who runs the 
food farm, is that students build this place themselves: "They have a sense of 
ownership of the vegetable garden that excites them about learning. It will, we 
hope, create a relationship with nature that will last all their lives."

 In the world of corporate-sponsored child-care centers, Mark Rios is rapidly 
earning a reputation for stylish design that integrates the innovative and the 
practical. Over the past few years, Rios and his staff have created facilities 
in Southern California for Warner Bros., Mattel Toys, Disney and MCA/Universal 
Studios. The very look of these snappy settings is calculated to put tots in an 
animated mood. They're free-flowing, full of light and shaped like flying kites 
and birds' wings. They offer plenty of opportunities, both indoors and out, to 
touch, climb and investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained as a building and landscape architect, Rios provides his clients with 
a complete package -- buildings, interiors and outdoor play spaces, even 
designing rugs and furniture when necessary to fit the specific site. 
</P>
<P>
 As they embark on each project, Rios and his associates consult 
child-development specialists for evaluations of the team's ideas. They also 
cast back to their own childhoods and re-create cherished memories in what they 
build: waterways reminiscent of run-through lawn sprinklers; play structures 
with all the snug seclusion of a box-and-blanket fort. 
</P>
<P>
 By using natural and recycled materials, they also try to get young children 
to think about the environment and their place in it. But their main objective, 
says Rios, is "to promote learning and questioning at the same time that kids 
are having fun."

 To a jumpy juvenile fearful of doctors, time in a waiting room can be 
interminable. For a child with a disfigured face -- and no escape from curious 
stares -- it's even worse. One solution, conceived by Dr. John Reinisch of 
Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles, is a waiting room that soothes and distracts 
young patients while granting them plenty of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinisch, head of the hospital's plastic and reconstructive surgery division, 
worked with San Francisco-based NBBJ Architects to design just such a place for 
the children who come to him. Its centerpiece is a 400-gallon saltwater tank 
flashing with tropical fish. A hugely popular diversion, it's also one of the 
room's few light sources. Others include a porthole window in the reception 
area and a collection of oversized illuminated animal photos. 
</P>
<P>
 Colors are muted -- warm tans, grays and greens. "When it's dark, you don't 
notice details as much," says Reinisch, who treats youngsters with a range of 
abnormalities, from cleft palates to facial tumors. Patients who don't wish to 
be seen at all can withdraw to a compartment in the room's playhouse, which 
features a two-story slide and cubbyholes. 
</P>
<P>
 Such amenities, says Reinisch, while not directly related to the healing 
process, encourage a child's cooperation with the treatment. "Our patients," he 
explains, "may have to come here many times a year for lots of surgeries. If 
they hate being here, it's unpleasant for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 To Reinisch, peace and calm are the ingredients missing from most medical 
waiting rooms, especially for children. "Sometimes they've got a few blocks, 
some crayons and magazines that are quickly scattered and look messy. We were 
trying for something comforting, a room to put people at ease."

RESTAURANTS; LEAN AND MEAN; FAT-FREE PIZZAS, CHEESECAKE, TACOS: GUILT-FREE 
GORGING! TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE? MAYBE.

<P>
 Take a number," prompts the sign. We all crowd in front of the well-filled 
deli case, zeroing in on the salads, the triple-layer chocolate cake, the 
muffins. With its bright yellow walls, asymetrical chairs, a few tables out 
front and a mob of vocal regulars, Gratis has the casual ambience of a cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash register spits out receipts in a steady rush. Number 37! I give my 
order: grilled vegetable salad, herbed ricotta and dried tomato pizza, soft 
tacos, spinach-and-mushroom lasagna, vanilla-bean cheesecake and a piece of the 
special peach cobbler. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting, we eye the food some more. "Everything is fabulous," gushes a 
seriously slender woman in faux pearls and Chanel. "And the potato salad is to 
die for!" Two large women confer heatedly over the menu. "No, no, let's get the 
bow-tie pasta and the grilled Japanese eggplant and shiitake mushroom pizza," 
says one. "And the herbed ricotta ravioli. And the vegetarian chili -- that's 
really good." A newcomer to this 4-month-old Brentwood cafeteria looks over the 
entirely fat-free menu and bursts out laughing. "How can they possibly make a 
fat-free cheesecake that tastes any good?" he wonders, looking pointedly across 
the street at the Cheesecake Factory.  
</P>
<P>
 For lots of people (I am not one of them), all this fat-free food is too good 
to be true. Pastas, pizzas, chocolate cake. You can have it all. If you're a 
dedicated fitness buff, on a strict no- or low-fat diet or simply watching your 
weight, Gratis is not only fat-free but also guilt-free. 
</P>
<P>
 The food is also pretty much taste-free. Granted, the cooks are working with a 
stiff handicap: no oils, not to mention butter, pancetta, bacon or even nuts or 
olives or corn, all of which have fat. No fish or meat or poultry either (even 
the leanest is not lean enough). Many of us could stand to reduce fat in our 
diets, but to banish it entirely is tough. It soon becomes clear that it is a 
very big leap from low-fat to fat-free -- and one few of us would willingly 
take if the consequences were not so dire. 
</P>
<P>
 General manager Dale Greenblatt, who cooked at Spago and Spago Las Vegas 
before joining Gratis, spent a year and a half developing the recipes with the 
help of a consulting food technologist. He has some good ideas, but he needs to 
take the flavors further. At this point, breads and desserts are the most 
successful items. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing deprived about the straightforward flat bread with a garlicky 
garbanzo spread instead of butter. Blackened from the oven, the pizza dough has 
a good texture and chewiness. Nonfat mozzarella melts like the classic, and 
herbs deflect attention from the ricotta's chalkiness. Add a topping of 
sun-dried tomatoes or shiitake and eggplant, and this pizza is a reasonable 
replica. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenblatt has figured out how to mimic the textures of chocolate cake and 
cheesecake using no butter and "fat-free cream." Not bad. Not bad at all. If 
you're busy talking, drinking coffee or distracted in any way, you just might 
be fooled -- for a couple of bites. Dark and bittersweet, the triple-layered 
chocolate cake does have a moist crumb-like texture, but the taste doesn't 
linger in the mouth. I'd rather have one satisfying bite of a real cake than a 
huge slice of this version. The illusion is more credible in the dense 
vanilla-bean cheesecake topped with fat-free sour cream. The decent creme 
caramel has real caramelized sugar (only fat, not sugar, is banned here.) But 
the muffins, the poor, excruciatingly sweet muffins, have the texture of 
plastic foam.  
</P>
<P>
 The best of the soups is a gently spiced lentil. Black beans one day were 
grossly undercooked, and a harsh, acidic gazpacho tasted like doctored tomato 
juice. The unappetizing-looking salads are mostly a sorry lot. Soggy grilled 
vegetables have a gray cast and are doused with sweetish balsamic vinaigrette. 
Lentil salad tossed with a confetti of bright peppers is OK. The touted potato 
salad looks right, but in the mouth, the "mayonnaise" is just moist stuff with 
zero taste. Tabbouleh is in desperate need of handfuls of parsley, cilantro and 
scallions -- no fat there, so why be fainthearted? Tasti  
</P>
<P>
 est of the lot is the red and green coleslaw in a "creamy" dressing and the 
substantial bow-tie pasta salad with sun-dried tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to pasta, there is no reason you can't make a fabulous fat-free 
marinara sauce with deep-flavored tomatoes and fresh basil, but Gratis's 
metallic-tasting marinara does nothing for the huge slab of bland 
mushroom-and-spinach lasagna or the leaden ricotta-filled ravioli. The soft 
taco, an organic-wheat tortilla filled with shredded lettuce, a sweet, 
orange-brown vegetarian chili and squiggles of fat-free cheddar, is truly 
awful. 
</P>
<P>
 If I ever have to go fat-free (and I pray that I don't), I'll be dreaming of a 
fuzzy ripe peach dripping with juice or an unadorned vine-ripened tomato at the 
height of the season. I will not be dreaming of Gratis.

THEATER NOTES: IS THIS THE TRINITY REP OR THE TAPER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Don Shirley, Don Shirley is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Oskar Eustis left his job as associate artistic director of the Taper 
recently to become artistic director of Trinity Repertory Company in 
Providence, R.I., he certainly hasn't forgotten his L.A. friends. The next 
Trinity season looks like the Trinity has become the Taper-on-the-Narragansett. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Eustis will spend more time in Los Angeles than in Providence during 
the next few months, as he directs Eduardo Machado's "Floating Islands" at the 
Taper -- a job he insisted on being able to complete before he signed on at 
Providence. 
</P>
<P>
 While Eustis is busy in L.A., the first Trinity production under his tenure 
will be Shakespeare's "The Winter's Tale," directed by L.A.'s own Dakin 
Matthews, manager of the Taper-based Antaeus Company, which recently staged 
Chekhov's "The Wood Demon" on the Taper mainstage. But it won't be an Antaeus 
production -- the Trinity company will make up the cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Trinity production will be an import of David Schweizer's staging of 
Lisa Loomer's "The Waiting Room," now on stage at the Taper. Again, the cast 
will be Trinity-based, although June Kyoko Lu will repeat her Taper role. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on the season will be L.A.-based Endesha Ida Mae Holland's "From the 
Mississippi Delta," which was given a staged reading in the Taper's old Itchey 
Foot series, and "Slavs!," by Tony Kushner, with whom Eustis collaborated on 
the Taper's "Angels in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Three other offerings -- "A Christmas Carol," a new adaptation of "Moby Dick" 
and "God's Heart" -- have no Taper connection. But Trinity is taking up the 
shepherding of Craig Lucas' "God's Heart" from South Coast Repertory, where it 
previously had been slated for a winter production. Trinity will present it in 
the spring -- which at least theoretically won't conflict with the wintertime 
production schedule for the film version of Lucas' "Reckless." South Coast 
cited the filming schedule and its own inability to shift its season when it 
canceled its own production of "God's Heart," and Eustis snapped it up. 
</P>

 NOISES WITHOUT: A Noise Within, the Glendale classical company, isn't waiting 
until its home base is expanded into a larger facility. It's launching an 
ambitious touring program that will take it to at least five larger theaters 
next year -- complete with Actors' Equity contracts for the casts. 
</P>
<P>
 A revival of last season's "The Importance of Being Earnest" will go out to 
the Norris in Palos Verdes (Jan. 11-13), Campbell Hall at UC Santa Barbara 
(Jan. 19) and the Annenberg Center in Palm Springs (Jan. 21), interrupted by a 
Jan. 14-15 return engagement at home in Glendale. Then, in May, "Earnest" will 
play the Poway Center (May 4-14), "A Midsummer Night's Dream" will play the 
Norris ((May 24-26), and both shows will be in rep at the Maui Arts and 
Cultural Center (May 31-June 4), the group's first out-of-state gig. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has received a $2.5-million allocation of Glendale redevelopment 
money to move up to larger quarters within Glendale. But the tours "allow us to 
pay the actors while our facility is being planned," said artistic co-director 
Art Manke. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, those of us who had been delighted to hear that A Noise Within was 
finally replacing its old, hard pews with theater seats for next fall's season 
will have to wait a while longer. The donated seats, originally from a movie 
theater, were of the rocking variety, which Manke said might distract from, 
say, the three-hour "King Lear" that will open the season. However, he promises 
extra padding on the old pews, including the pew backs. And he defends the pews 
on the grounds that "theater started in a church" and because pews encourage "a 
communal feel" that unites the audience.

<P>
 In pain, perhaps?

ON THE RECORD: THE DUPRE MASTERY, IN RETROSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's hardly surprising that a mystique has attached to Jacqueline DuPre, the 
British cellist who died in 1987 at age 42, 15 years after her brief career was 
ended by the onset of multiple sclerosis, the crippling disease to which she 
would eventually succumb. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing circle of DuPre admirers was considerably widened with the 
posthumous re-release of her videotaped performance of, and irresistible 
physical presence in, Elgar's Cello Concerto, the work that made her reputation 
in the early '60s while bringing the score previously unimagined popularity and 
setting a standard by which subsequent interpretations are judged. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a mid-priced EMI set (68132, six CDs), the legend can be separated 
from the accomplishment as never before, demystification being at least one 
order of the journalistic day. 
</P>
<P>
 For some writers. To these ears, the set confirms the gifts and appeal not of 
some otherworldly creature, but of an immensely gifted and quite wonderfully 
human -- and flawed -- artist. It's the approachability of her style that 
shines through the best of this revealing collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1965 Elgar recording re mains almost painfully communicative. It's a 
wonderfully old-fashioned interpretation: full of sighing rubatos and the 
nowadays-excoriated portamentos. Her work is almost intuitively seconded by 
that most understanding and warmhearted of conductors, Sir John Barbirolli, who 
directs the London Symphony. One among many wonders here is that a reportedly 
unworldly woman, not quite 21 years old, could tap into and project the vein of 
infinite longing, even heartbreak, that suffuses this incomparable work. 
</P>
<P>
 DuPre didn't achieve comparable popular success with her next concerto 
recording, of Delius' neglected 1921 opus. Yet it displays another shining 
facet of her artistry: the seeming instinctive ability to pick up structural 
threads, to make an entity out of what in lesser hands -- than hers and those 
of her conductor, Sir Malcolm Sargent -- seems formless. 
</P>
<P>
 Other treasures are the Beethoven Sonatas, Opus 69 and Opus 102, No. 1, in 
which the cellist, ever inclined to dream, would seem to be mismatched with a 
fierily go-ahead pianist, Stephen Bishop (as he was then known). But, 
surprisingly, the opposites are immensely attractive and ultimately compatible, 
with each giving up just enough individuality to create a working partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Less successful, although not without their moments, are the familiar 
concertos of Dvorak, Schumann and Saint-Saens. The villain of these pieces is 
DuPre's conductor (and husband), Daniel Barenboim, whose glutinous orchestral 
backings offer her nothing to play against, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Haydn concertos dawdle too much for Classical comfort, their failings 
attributable equally to DuPre's inaptly lush tone -- as with some excellent 
singers, it wasn't easily emitted -- and the soft-centered accompaniments of 
Barbirolli and Barenboim in the concertos in D and C, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Bach unaccompanied suites, the earliest entries here (1961), heard via BBC 
radio transcriptions, are labored in the extreme, although admirers of the old 
Casals edition may not think so. But her loving treatment of the sonatas of 
Chopin and Franck constitutes prime stuff, a combination of Romantic freedom 
and linear clarity, thanks in no small part to the masterly keyboard 
partnership of one Daniel Barenboim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, two recently released cello recordings deserving of particular 
attention. In the first, Russian-born Mischa Maisky plays the Beethoven Sonatas 
Opus 69 and Opus 102, Nos. 1 and 2, as half of a brilliantly theatrical team -- 
which is intended as a compliment -- with the ever-inventive pianist Martha 
Argerich (Deutsche Grammophon 437 514). 
</P>
<P>
 And via Bulgarian Radio tapes (no dates supplied), Los Angeles' own Nathaniel 
Rosen displays his big, handsomely craggy tone in a forceful reading of 
Tchaikovsky's often wimpy "Rococo" Variations (and some attractive shorter 
Tchaikovsky pieces) and offers a darkly powerful, propulsive Shostakovich First 
Concerto, both with the thoughtful collaboration of Emil Tabakov, who conducts 
the Sofia Philharmonic (John Marks Records JMR 3).

POP EYE: FALL'S GONNA BE A MONSTER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In this corner, wearing a golden mane and Mickey Mouse shorts, the current 
album champion . . . "The Lion King"! 
</P>
<P>
 And in this corner, the No. 1 challenger, set to wrestle for the pop charts 
crown, the pride of Athens, Ga. . . . R.E.M.! 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get ready to rrrruuuummmmbbbblllle ! 
</P>
<P>
 Week after week, no one -- including the Rolling Stones -- has been able to 
knock "The Lion King" soundtrack album off the top of the pop album charts. But 
the reign may soon be over as a slew of superstar acts is preparing to release 
much-anticipated new collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can dethrone the "King"? 
</P>
<P>
 A Pop Eye panel of record retailers, radio programmers and trade magazine 
pundits is picking R.E.M.'s "Monster" to do the job.  
</P>
<P>
 The album, due in stores Sept. 27, is described by those who have heard it as 
a solid, straight-ahead rock effort with the kind of twists we've come to 
expect from Michael Stipe and crew. Adding to the fire are huge expectations of 
the group's first concert tour in more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if R.E.M. doesn't scale those heights, the retailers are licking 
their chops over a wealth of other releases that could.  
</P>
<P>
 Here's how our panel ranks the Top 10 contenders: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- R.E.M.'s "Monster," Warner Bros. The group's last album, "Automatic for 
the People," sold 3 million copies without a tour to support it. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Pearl Jam's "Vitalogy," Epic, release date to be announced. The Seattle 
group's album "Vs." set a first-week sales record last October. "You can't 
doubt the success of Pearl Jam," says Tommy Nast, senior vice president of the 
music trade publication Album Network. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- The Eagles' "Hell Freezes Over," Geffen, release date to be announced. 
"There's a lot of interest in the new songs that will be on the Eagles album," 
says Jeff Pollack, president of the music consulting firm Pollack Media. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Barbra Streisand's "The Concert," Columbia, due Oct. 4. Fans will covet 
this souvenir of her recent tour -- her first in more than two decades and, she 
says, her last. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Eric Clapton's "From the Cradle," Warner Bros., due Sept. 13. The veteran 
English guitarist, whose "Unplugged" was a big Grammy winner and a No. 1 hit in 
1993, returns to his roots with this all-blues collection. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- Tom Petty's "Wildflowers," Warner Bros., due Oct. 11. "How can you not 
take the combination of him and (producer) Rick Rubin?" says Nast. 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- Nirvana's "Unplugged," DGC/Geffen. The scarcity of unreleased Nirvana 
material ups the interest. 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- Kenny G's "Miracles," Arista, due Oct. 25. The mellow sax-man's 
collection of Christmas standards "will be a monster," says Stan Goman, senior 
vice president of the Tower chain. 
</P>
<P>
 9 -- Mariah Carey's "Merry Christmas," Columbia, due Nov. 1. Another seasonal 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 10 -- Peter Gabriel's "Secret World Live," Geffen, due Sept. 13. A two-CD 
in-concert collection from the Woodstock '94 closing act. 
</P>
<P>
 Some dark-horse picks include the Black Crowes' "Amorica," the second album 
from the Cranberries and the second album by Chicago's Liz Phair, whose 1993 
debut was No. 1 in the Village Voice's national critics' poll. There were only 
a few nominations from R&B (Boyz II Men, Anita Baker and Luther Vandross) and 
rap (Public Enemy and Eazy-E), while Clint Black was the only country act 
named. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about upcoming albums by Sinead O'Connor and Madonna, not to mention 
a Michael Jackson hits collection spiced with several new songs? 
</P>
<P>
 A typical comment about Madonna's still-untitled album, from Bob Bell, the new 
release buyer for the Wherehouse chain: "She's going to have to make a pretty 
great record to have a big hit." Steve Hochman

 LUSCIOUS JACKSON 
</P>
<P>
 "Natural Ingredients" 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Royal/Capitol  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 New York's Luscious Jackson has all the right ingredients for an insta-buzz: 
The quartet was not only the first band out on the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal 
label, but is also one of the only white, female hip-hop-based groups around. 
But the band hardly rests on those hype-ish elements. 
</P>
<P>
 On its first full album, Luscious picks up where the underdeveloped but 
promising EP "In Search of Manny" left off. Vocals by bassist Jill Cuniff and 
guitarist Gabby Glaser are enigmatic and sultry, like a post-Latifah Lauren 
Bacall, while such lyrics as "Hey energy sucker, I'm a goddess, not your 
mother" leave no guessing where the band's head is at. 
</P>
<P>
 Muffled dance beats, fleeting vocal effects and Curtis Mayfield samples, sax 
and groovy organ are all very low-key and calm. "Natural" can be a bit too 
understated at times, but for the most part its subtlety helps make it a unique 
and compelling album. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

 KURT REMEMBERED: Courtney Love is paying tribute to her late husband, Kurt 
Cobain, in the upcoming video for her band Hole's song "Doll Parts," casting a 
slight, blond boy to play the young Kurt.  
</P>
<P>
 In the video, directed by Samuel Bay, who also did Nirvana's breakthrough 
"Smells Like Teen Spirit," Love will be seen singing on a big, ornate bed while 
the boy darts in and out of shadows surrounding the scene.Thoughout, Love tries 
to reach to the boy, but he remains elusive. At the end, though, she finally 
makes contact and cradles him in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the project says there had been some initial concern that 
the imagery would be exploitative of Cobain's suicide, but that the results are 
in fact quite "touching." STEVE HOCHMAN

 The dark, brooding look you'll see on Trent Reznor's face on the cover of 
Rolling Stone next week isn't entirely organic. The magazine hired computer 
graphic artist Mark Mahurin -- the same guy who did the notorious O.J. Simpson 
touch-up for Time magazine -- to make a photo of the pale industrial-rocker 
look grimmer.It would have been cheaper if they'd just waited for Reznor to 
smear himself with Woodstock mud. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One Woodstock performer you won't be seeing much of for a while is Peter 
Gabriel. He's planning to take a year off before beginning any new projects. .

late, working on a new album that focuses on his rock 'n' roll side. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A video is being assembled for Urge Overkill's version of Neil Diamond's 
"Girl, You'll be a Woman Soon," the first single from the soundtrack album of 
Quentin Tarantino's film "Pulp Fiction." The album, due Sept. 13, also features 
old hits by Al Green, Ricky Nelson, Dusty Springfield and others. . . .

 A big dancehall reggae festival is being staged in Jamaica on Saturday to 
serve as the centerpiece of the film "Klash," a heist drama set in the 
dancehall world and starring actress-singer Jasmine Guy. Among the performers 
scheduled for the concert and the film are Shabba Ranks, Mad Cobra and Buju 
Banton, with hopes that this will do for the genre what "The Harder They Come" 
did for reggae in the early '70s. Cedella Marley, Bob Marley's daughter, also 
makes an appearance in the film.

 Ice Cube's "Bop Gun" is a solid fixture in The Times' Southern California

"Forrest Gump," remain the 1-2 punch atop the pop album chart. Warren G's 
"Regulate. . .G-Funk Era" still rules on the rap album chart, while Boyz II Men

 EAGLE HUNTING: A recent Boston concert stint by the Eagles led Beantown rock 
radio station WBCN-FM to bare its talons -- and Don Henley to respond in kind. 
Attacking the band's concert ticket prices of about $100, the station held a 
contest and awarded $50 "Eagles Greedy Rebates" to eight Boston concert-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The radio station has nothing against the Eagles at all," says WBCN 
promotions director Chachi Loprete. "We've played them for years. But when the 
tickets went on sale we thought they were way too high and set a bad precedent 
and we thought we should do something." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the rebate contest, the station preceded the Eagles' shows with 
an "Anti-Greed Weekend," emphasizing music by acts who have come out against 
high ticket prices, such as Pearl Jam and Neil Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 During the Eagles' opening-night show at Boston's 20,000-seat Great Woods 
arena, home phone numbers and addresses of five WBCN deejays were flashed on 
video screens and Henley asked fans to send them their dirty laundry before 
singing his song "Dirty Laundry." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles spokesman Larry Solters dismissed the incidents as merely the latest 
flaps in a war of words that goes back nearly five years to Henley's not giving 
WBCN exclusive promotion rights to his Boston concerts benefiting his Walden 
Woods Foundation. STEVE HOCHMAN

 PEACE AND MUSIC: It wasn't all peace and love at Woodstock '94 -- not when the 
festival's co-producer John Scher refused to give an all-access pass to his old 
pal Tim Collins, Aerosmith's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, already angry because Metallica was allowed to sell its own T-shirts 
and use pyrotechnics during its show -- which Collins had been told were strict 
no-nos -- confronted Scher backstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'John, I don't trust you anymore,' " Collins told Pop Eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins says that Scher then threw a bottle of Evian water across the room 
and, after more verbal exchanges, lunged at him. A Collins associate came in to 
break it up, only to get into it with Scher himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Scher was unavailable for comment. His partner, Jim Koplik, says, "John . . . 
had peaked that afternoon when we had 350,000 people in the audience instead of 
the 200,000 we expected. He cracked . . . under the pressure."STEVE HOCHMAN

 Cecilia Coleman is a competent pianist with a highly individual voice: quiet, 
sincere and to-the-point. Her understated improvisational style, at once shyly 
romantic and revealingly sensitive, is accented by an equally spare mode of 
accompaniment.Her sidemen on this eight-cut disc do little to vary the reserved 
mood, working in emotional tones best described as well-adjusted rather than 
frantic. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, especially trumpeter Steve Huffsteter, shows refined be-bop tastes 
on "House of Cards," and tenor saxophonist Andy Suzuki generates a bit of steam 
during the title tune. But there's a certain blandness to the program as the 
quintet sails along on an even keel with nary a stormy moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, the composer is equally reserved (six of the tunes are hers), with 
"Slippin' " standing out for its melodic pleasantness. But someone should give 
Coleman a good pinch. "Young and Foolish" shows too much cool, and not enough 
heat.

poll-winning flutist Newton emphasizes his compositional side on his first 
release in four years.The title suite, inspired by four of the famed Mexican 
artist's paintings, creates absorbing mood swings by blending the tone colors 
of an unusual eight-piece ensemble (flute, trombones, bassoon, reeds and rhythm 
section) with occasional dashes of jazz swing and tempo shifts a la Mingus. 
Elsewhere, Newton doesn't neglect his playing, soaring and swooping over the

 Nnenna Freelon, a singer who keeps getting better, employs not only words but 
a variety of sounds on her recent album, which leads off this group of new 
releases.

 Everything comes together here.Though singer Freelon's sound and style are the 
dominant forces, she contributes lyrics and/or music to several of the songs, 
most of which are unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, this is a small-group session; however, here and there, invaluably 
supportive arrangements were contributed by Bill Fischer. It is a pleasure to 
hear lyrics added to Bobby Hutcherson's "Lil B's Poem" and McCoy Tyner's 
"Ballad for Aisha." Freelon also wrote lyrics for Wayne Shorter's "Song of 
Silent Footprints." 
</P>
<P>
 There are several wordless passages, mostly of the non-scat variety. Jon 
Lucien makes a couple of guest appearances. A lesser-known Ellington tune, "A 
Hundred Dreams From Now," is yet another delight. Finally, who can resist 
another version of Kurt Weill's "Lost in the Stars"?

 GROVER WASHINGTON JR.

<P>
 "All My Tomorrows" 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 This album, while being touted as a "mainstream" session from saxman 
Washington, is really more high-quality easy-listening jazz, with tempos 
relaxed and solos reflecting the melodies of songs. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who knows how to deliver a melody with feeling, Washington is in good 
company here. The vehicles -- "When I Fall in Love," "Nature Boy," the title 
track, Stevie Wonder's "Overjoyed" -- are first-rate, the arrangements by Larry 
Willis and Slide Hampton just-so. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the elegant rhythm team of Hank Jones (piano), George Mraz (bass) 
and Billy Hart (drums) that gives the leader plush support, making him sound 
just at home here as he would in his usual jazz/funk realm. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington offers delicious soprano sax lines on the bossa nova "E Preciso 
Perdoar," on the title track and on "Estate," while his gritty tenor sax tones 
bounce with life on a vamp on "Nature Boy." Freddie Cole (Nat's brother) adds 
three tasteful vocals, and is joined by Jeanie Bryson on a fourth. Both 
brassman Eddie Henderson and pianist Jones deliver solos that exude warmth, 
energy and musicality.

FOUR-STAR FILMS; 'MY DARLING CLEMENTINE'

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Ford's 1946 classic is as much a love story as a Western. Between the 
murder of James Earp by cattle rustlers and the final confrontation with his 
killers in the legendary gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt Earp (Henry Fonda) 
agrees to become marshal of the wide-open Tombstone of 1882.He establishes a 
friendship with the complex, hard-drinking and tubercular Doc Holliday (Victor 
Mature) and becomes smitten with Doc's proper Bostonian fiance (Cathy Downs) 
while a fiery saloon entertainer (Linda Darnell) dreams of Doc making an honest 
woman of her. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, who embraced all of Tombstone's raffish citizenry, brings a detached 
compassion to the inevitable confrontation between the good guys and the bad 
guys. Its effortlessly yet magnificently composed images, all attest to an 
affirmation of human worth and dignity (Disney Friday at 12:30 a.m.)

CRITIC'S PICKS: 'MAC'

<P>
By Kevin Thomas

<TEXT>
<P>
 This engaging 1992 film gives us a pretty good idea of where John Turturro's 
manic intensity comes from. Playing a man based on his own father, Turturro is 
the archetypal blue-collar ethnic guy who gets a wild, frozen look in his eyes 
just before exploding.At once a labor of love that was 12 years in gestation 
and an exorcism, "Mac," which marks Turturro's directorial debut, is filled 
with a clear-eyed love and respect. It is about three brothers involved in 
construction who, in Queens, 1954, make the big leap of going into business for 
themselves. For Turturro's Mac there is no conflict between love and work, but 
the film shows us that the tough perfectionist who can inspire fierce loyalty 
from his men can also instill massive resentment in his own brothers (Showtime 
Monday at 3:10 a.m.). Kevin Thomas

 There's something delightfully pure and fresh about Masanori Hata's 1989 
children's film, an epic tale about male bonding between an orange kitten 
(Milo) and a pug-nosed puppy (Otis) that's full of clean sunlight and waving 
grass. Populated entirely by bears, foxes and snakes, as well as the usual 
barnyard assortment, it generates the blissfully dry sense of wonder that the 
best children's books and movies do (Showtime Thursday at 12:35 p.m.). Michael

 This popular 1992 English film slides us back to a summery British past of 
literary epigrams and romantic yearning.It's a movie about a vacation -- a 
perfect dream holiday -- where all discontent is finally banished in a 
Portofino villa shimmering with erotic energy and floral splendor. Based on a 
70-year-old novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, it's a pure wish-fulfillment story, 
but there's an acid edge to it. The villa's four women vacationers initially 
seem a mismatch -- a desperately optimistic type (Josie Lawrence) and her new 
straight-arrow acquaintance (Miranda Richardson) and their new companions, an 
elderly literary snob (Joan Plowright) and an idle rich beauty (Polly Walker) 
(TMC Thursday at 6:25 p.m.). Michael Wilmington

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; TATYANA ALI'S 'FRESH PRINCE' CHARACTER KEEPS HER 
GROUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Tatyana M. Ali, who plays sweet but very privileged Ashley Banks on NBC's 
popular "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," may attend a private girls' school, but 
that's where her lifestyle and Ashley's part ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "My real life isn't anything like hers," she says from her modest San Fernando 
Valley home, where she lives with her mother and two sisters, Anastasia, 11, 
and Kimberly, 8. Ali's immigrant Trinidadian father is a police detective in 
New York -- where the family is from -- and her immigrant Panamanian mother is 
a registered nurse. Her father, currently up for retirement, commutes from Long 
Island to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary to think about making that move to L.A. completely!" she sighs, 
contemplating what will happen if her father sells their New York home and 
moves to L.A. permanently. "We'll need a big house. Even if it's just the five 
of us, it seems like more. We're a very active family." 
</P>
<P>
 But that fictional Bel-Air mansion, shown in all its glory in the show's 
opening credit, enchants fans. "I get a lot of mail from the little kids," she 
says, "who always ask me how big the house is." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the youngest Miss Banks, "They've really made her more like me, as 
we've gone along." Ali, now a mature 15, was 11 when the show premiered in the 
fall of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cast gets tons of input and we sit down with the writers and producers 
and brainstorm for each show," she says. "Fresh Prince" resumed shooting its 
fifth season last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting proved a healthy outlet for Ali, who was sent to preschool early to 
channel some of her energy. "I was very precocious and very hyper and a real 
ham," she recalls. "I thought acting might be something fun and keep me busy." 
</P>
<P>
 At 4, she got her first commercial, which was followed by a four-year run on 
PBS' popular "Sesame Street." She's still approached about episodes she 
appeared on long ago. "They run them forever," she sighs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Herbie Hancock was a guest when I was about 5 and he was demonstrating his 
synthesizer and he used my name over and over in a kind of computer opera," she 
says. "At least 10 mothers have come up to me throughout the years saying they 
named their daughter Tatyana after that show!" 
</P>
<P>
 Another show will resonate with her name this fall, as Ali joins Jordan Brady 
and Mario Lopez as a co-host of NBC's Saturday-morning show "Name Your 
Adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, she starred in her first TV movie, "Foster's Field Trip," which 
co-stars David Lascher ("Blossom") and Darius McCrary ("Family Matters") and 
will air in December. In a total turnaround from Ashley, Ali plays Rita, a 
foster child "who's been shopped around too much and doesn't like people. She's 
a real loner, always dressed in black and always depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 What began as an energy outlet for a little girl has become a career goal for 
a teen who wants to continue to act, attend film school and appear in a 
feature. "I've done Broadway and TV and that is the next step." 
</P>
<P>
 For now she's glad "Fresh Prince" has resumed shooting. "Will (Smith) is 
exactly like his character, but more mature," she assures. Her co-stars have 
become a second family. "We have a blast. It's so much fun, I guess, because we 
really like each other." Being the youngest on the set has its advantages: 
Co-stars Smith, James Avery, who plays her father, and Alfonso Ribeiro, who 
plays her brother, are "like my big brothers." And disadvantages: "But they're 
super-protective. I couldn't ever bring a boy on the set. They would have a 
heart attack!" 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" airs Monday at 8 p.m. on NBC. "Name Your 
Adventures" airs Saturday at 9 a.m. on NBC.

ON VIEW; BETWEEN TWO CULTURES; PBS EXPLORES THE TRUE STORY OF A WOMAN WHO BROKE 
DOWN BARRIERS BETWEEN JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 "Here was a woman who was too Japanese for Americans and too American for the 
Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
 These are the words of Sheldon Larry, describing Haru Reischauer, the woman 
whose story Larry directs in "Long Shadows," airing Wednesday on KCET. The 
"American Playhouse" production -- the story of a woman heretofore known mostly 
as someone's wife -- is the first bco-production by KCET and NHK/Japan 
Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Japanese side wanted a documentary about the Reischauers as a 
couple when they first approached producer Ricki Franklin four years ago, she 
had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had known who Edwin Reischauer (former ambassador to Japan) was," she 
explains, "but I knew very little about his wife. But once I and Milan Stitt 
(the writer) met her and learned about her life, we agreed that the story here 
is Haru. It had a real contemporary resonance." Here, after all, was a shy, 
reluctant diplomat's wife who not only outlived her marriage of 35 years, but 
became an outspoken person in her own right, including the creation of a 
women's department in the embassy in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 While Edwin Reischauer had grown up in Japan before coming to America, Haru 
was raised in Tokyo but completed her education in America. She thereafter went 
back and forth throughout her whole life, and still lives in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing with the Japanese as partners in the production was not always easy -- 
not because of any rancor, but the result of contrasting cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a word called kata, " explains Larry, "which means blueprint. And 
they have an extremely ritualistic kata for everything. When there's no 
blueprint, they're at a loss, while we Americans are more 'seat of our pants.' 
But to their credit, they were wonderful hosts." (The production shot in Japan 
for nine days.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It was also extremely difficult to get permission from them to shoot around 
Tokyo," adds Larry. "We wanted to shoot a protest scene at a university there, 
which took months to negotiate. And in the end we still couldn't get it because 
they were afraid it would reflect badly on the university. Still, shooting 
there gives the film a look and feel it never would have had." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Larry's great challenges was eliciting a realistic performance from 
lead actress Fumi Dan, a star in Japan, but unknown in America and unversed in 
English. Both Dan and Matt Frewer ("Max Headroom," "Doctor, Doctor") as her 
husband, age over many decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had her brought here for a month to work with a coach," says Larry. "The 
Japanese acting style is a bit more representational and stylistic. But Fumi 
put herself in my hands and went places emotionally she'd never been." 
</P>
<P>
 For Frewer, playing Reischauer, who was a widower with three children when he 
met Haru, the role was too good to turn down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pored over a lot of photos," says Frewer," and I worked hard at learning 
Japanese. It's a hard language to pick up, to get the music of, as opposed to 
just the words. But mostly I was concerned with making his aging believable. I 
tried to capture how his whole being changed -- there was a defeated quality 
about him -- after Kennedy's assassination, and the attack soon after on his 
own life. It was one of those roles I would have done for free." 
</P>
<P>
 But "Long Shadows" mostly is the portrait of a remarkable and intelligent 
woman, one torn her whole life between two cultures. ("Do I bow or shake 
hands?") 
</P>
<P>
 "She broke down many barriers and took it as a matter of course," says Ricki 
Franklin, who is most responsible for sticking with a project that came close 
to dying many times over the years. "Haru is not only a role model but a 
wonderful human being and I hope that speaks to all viewers." 
</P>
<P>
 The production aired in April in Japan to very high ratings, and PBS has 
equally high hopes for it here. "I've always felt public television was not the 
place to do lily-white productions," says Franklin. "So many of us come from 
immigrant parents and there is so much drama in these conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Shadows" airs at 9 p.m. Wednesday on KCET.

 One of the cardinal rules of moviegoing is that if you skip a meal to go to a 
screening, you will invariably be tor tured by a great big stomach-gurgling 
eating scene. So the arrival of "Like Water for Chocolate" in the video stores 
this week is particularly good news: It means it is possible to view the film 
and not worry about getting unquenchably hungry. Now you can watch it at home 
and eat a great meal at the same time . The easy availability of fare more 
fascinating than killer popcorn and Goobers may actually make the movie seem 
better . Or perhaps it works the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 The other art-house-meets-the-multiplex hit out on video this week is "Four 
Weddings and a Funeral." Romance with a British accent has always bowled over 
American audiences. What made this one click with couples is the buffoonish 
charm mixed in with all the pip-pip witticisms -- it's a tuxedo with baggy 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
 If you play these two out and feel the need for more of same, only different, 
there are some amenable -- yea, better -- choices gathering electrostatic dust 
in the video bins.

 BABETTE'S FEAST: When this 1987 best foreign-language film Academy Award 
winner came out, a local hoity-toity French restaurant (since closed) offered 
up its pricey version of the film's feast, complete with pigeon en croute and 
turtle soup. The source material was a short story by Isak ("Out of Africa") 
Dinesen -- originally published in the Ladies Home Journal! -- and it 
culminates in a glutinous array of lovingly lit cuisine that would make a 
hunger-striker renounce all principle. Food never seemed so sensual. (Up until 
that point, the film is all Danish village winterscapes and pious repressed 
sufferers!) 
</P>

 TAMPOPO: The Citizen Kane of food movies. This 1987 Japanese comedy has oodles 
of noodles. It features a widow trying to keep her noodle shop and a deadpan 
cowboy trucker who wants to help out. It's farcical and sexy -- a rare combo. 
Food in this film isn't just a stand-in for sex . . . it is sex. Best scene: A 
gangster and his moll exchange pleasantries by rolling an egg yolk back and 
forth between their open mouths. When it breaks, it's pure consummation.

 MONTY PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF LIFE: Multipart Python madness. The episode 
featuring the world's most obese man is the greatest cautionary tale in the 
history of food-on-film. As each sumptuous dish is placed before him, and 
gobbled, a horrible feeling sets in. This is, after all, Monty Python -- it can 
only come to a bad end. And it does. An after-dinner mint becomes the catalyst 
for a cornucopia of digested goodies. WARNING: Unlike the other films mentioned 
above, "The Meaning of Life" should be viewed on an empty stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 If you like the wit in "Four Weddings," the same screenwriter, Richard Curtis, 
wrote a much funnier film back in 1989: 
</P>
<P>
 THE TALL GUY: Starring Jeff Goldblum as an expatriate American actor in 
London, it sends up everything from Benny Hill-style low comedy to Andrew Lloyd 
Webber musicals. Emma Thompson plays the tart nurse who gives Goldblum his 
hay-fever shots, and Rowan Atkinson, who plays the verbally challenged priest 
in "Four Weddings," plays a hyperobnoxious comic. Goldblum is a marvel here -- 
he keeps working himself into a series of neuromuscular amazements. And the 
Lloyd Webber take-off is a musical version of "The Elephant Man" titled 
"Elephant!" As a satire of the musical theater, the "Elephant!" sequences rival 
Mel Brooks' "Springtime for Hitler" numbers in "The Producers." 
</P>
<P>
 GROUNDHOG DAY: Since everyone compared the time-loop premise of "Four Weddings 
and a Funeral" to "Groundhog Day," why not go to the source? In "Four 
Weddings," Hugh Grant plays a gent who is forever late to weddings; each bout 
of recurrent lateness registers like a replay of the one before. In "Groundhog 
Day," Bill Murray plays a newscaster whose day -- Groundhog Day -- inexplicably 
repeats itself every sunrise. And both films feature Andie MacDowell as 
paramour. She's pretty ga-ga in both but this is one of Murray's best. 
</P>
<P>
 PETER'S FRIENDS: Kenneth Branagh directed this bawdy, convivial Brit house 
party, and stars in it with -- guess who? -- Emma Thompson. Rita Rudner, who 
scripted, also turns up. It's a bit too Neil Simon-ized and cloying, but it 
scores off the upper-crust roustabouts in a way that sometimes prompts heavy 
giggles. Don't watch for Andie MacDowell. She's not here.

 Congratulations, Martin Bernheimer, for the first time I agree with you 
("Monster Concert Afterthoughts," Aug. 7). 
</P>
<P>
 You were too kind to Tibor Rudas, the promoter. Rudas disappointed my husband 
and me greatly by locating his Luciano Pavarotti one-night performance on Oct. 
22, 1992 at the San Diego Sports Arena. The location seemed "iffy" but 
Pavarotti was a sure thing, so we went. The sound was horrible and expensive 
tickets placed us well to his side and above his left cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, when we found out the "Three Tenors" were coming to L.A., we had 
mixed emotions: Dodger Stadium? Tickets that ran to $1,000! Uh oh! Rudas was at 
it again! 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we went. Who said "There's a sucker born every minute!"? Rudas' mentor, 
P.T. Barnum, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 And what did the $300 tickets get us besides a repeat lesson of 1992? Armed 
with powerful binoculars . . . we got a great view of Zubin Mehta's rear end. 
No tenor could be seen around it. And Mehta is not fat, nor was the staging 
brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant TV was not in sight, hidden from view by the giant jungle, sans 
volcano. And by now curiosity might get you to wonder, where did they put those 
lucky $300 per ticket folks? We were seated slightly inside the foul line pole 
on the south side in spite of tickets marked field . 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived at 9 p.m. thanks to locked traffic and some diplomat who literally 
closed down the freeway ahead of us for security. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pavarotti's "Ave Maria" ricocheted all over, we did what few dared . . . 
we moved! 
</P>
<P>
 Now in one of the many empty seats in our designated area, which was carefully 
guarded against "upgrades," we sat behind home plate but in direct view of the 
tiny tenors in the great beyond. Due to the first tier overhang, we had to bend 
over to see them on the giant TV. Meanwhile, our twentysomething sons loved the 
performance from their $15 seats in the sky. "The TV was great!" they 
commented. 
</P>
<P>
 Only sentiment made the trek from south Orange County worth it. If Rudas, or 
anyone else, ever offers an event with such a lure as the "Three Tenors" again 
in a sports facility, we will say with peace of mind, "Sorry, been there, done 
that!"

 Poor Martin Bernheimer seems to be suffering the effects of giving an honest 
review to a number of popular local concerts. The problem is that the "Three 
Tenors" and Van Cliburn events don't belong in one of the newly reformatted 
Calendar sections of theater, performing arts, art, pop music, jazz or Las 
Vegas. There needs to be another section for Mass Entertainment (ME), which 
would include Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals, Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, 
one-name stars (Madonna, Roseanne), Andy Warhol paintings, Woodstock revivals 
and the O.J. Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 No normal human being could possibly cover these events, so I propose (for a 
modest fee) writing a computer program called "Love Me" which reads in 
information about the event (performers, date, attendance, etc.) and generates 
glowing reviews suitable for "Entertainment Tonight" and its clones. Every 
review would be rated 11 or above on a scale of 1 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love Me" would save Times critics from massive traffic jams and poor seats 
since no one would ever need to attend a ME concert. They could then devote 
themselves to covering the events that the remaining 2% of readers really care 
about. Everyone will be happy.

 Well, bless my boots. I'm sorry Martin Bernheimer sees something corny in the 
world's three great tenors getting up and singing something corny. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rest of us can't carry a tune, so if we're wiping our eyes at 
hearing Messrs. Domingo, Carreras and Pavarotti, then it probably means there's 
something in our DNA that believes in tenors.

 I paid heed to Martin Bernheimer's commentary about the "Three Tenors" and 
decided there was nothing to lose by giving a listen to a John McCormack CD of 
"Songs of My Heart," recorded between 1930 and 1941. McCormack's musical fare 
-- Irish songs and old favorites -- paralleled the mega concert, except, in 
lieu of the Philharmonic, he was accompanied by Gerald Moore and Edwin 
Schneider, pianists. 
</P>
<P>
 The artistry contained in these 60-year-old recordings was a welcome relief 
from the ballyhooed musical bombast of the millennia seen and heard on the KCET 
fund-raiser. Thank you, Martin, you've got the right stuff.

 James Hammerstein in "A Dark 'Sound of Music'? Check," (Aug. 7) finally 
identified for me why I could never "tune in" to "The Sound of Music."Because 
of its background in time and place, Hammerstein correctly labels the original 
"too sugarcoated." The sweetness of its sound contrasts the horror of its 
story. I have never been able to accept one without the other. Therefore, "The 
Sound of Music" is not my choice for listening or viewing pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish Hammerstein good luck in his efforts with the play and appreciate his 
sensitivity to its subject.

'BEASTS' OF ANOREXIA NERVOSA, BULIMIA RAVAGED GYMNAST'S BODY; HEALTH: CHRISTY 
HENRICH WAS 22 AND WEIGHED LESS THAN 60 POUNDS WHEN SHE DIED. HER FAMILY HOPES 
HER STORY WILL SAVE OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WILSTEIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strong, lithe and vivacious, Christy Henrich spent years spinning, leaping and 
vaulting across balance beams, around parallel bars and over padded mats, a 
muscular sprite nicknamed "E.T." for Extra Tough. 
</P>
<P>
 That seems impossibly long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 26, withered to little more than a fragile skeleton, her papery skin a 
ghostly gray-white, her gums and kidneys bleeding, her throat ulcerated, her 
heart barely pumping, Henrich died of multiple organ failure. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 22 and weighed less than 60 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Engaged to be married, she had never reached puberty. A starvation diet had 
tricked her emaciated body into perpetual childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Many saw the tragic wasting of her body caused by bulimia and anorexia 
nervosa, but few saw inside to the torturous shame she hid away, until it was 
too late. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been hospitalized more than 15 times since 1990, her final year of 
competition as one of America's top gymnasts. She once yanked out an 
intravenous tube and let it drip into a wastebasket, worried the sugar water 
would make her fat. 
</P>
<P>
 If such details of Henrich's struggle are to help any of the thousands 
afflicted by eating disorders, as her family hopes, the depth of the 
degradation she imposed on herself must be understood. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life is a horrifying nightmare," she once said. "It feels like there's a 
beast inside of me, like a monster. It feels evil." 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich grappled with shame -- intense, insidious, impossible to shed -- 
throughout therapy last summer. It was a desperate time, perhaps her last real 
chance to save herself, and she ultimately quit in exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 "She felt shame toward everything in her life and it drove her 
obsessive-compulsive behavior, her perfectionism, her self-punishment," said 
Dr. Gail Vaughn, a psychotherapist for addictive disorders who counseled 
Henrich and her family for four months. "She was afraid of failure. She was 
terrified of being fat." 
</P>
<P>
 Much has been made of an offhand comment by a judge at a 1988 meet in Hungary. 
No one is sure what the woman said to Henrich, but the gymnast, at 4-feet-11 
and 95 pounds, took the remark to mean she was fat. She'd long believed the 
Soviet and Romanian girls were beating her because they were thinner; Henrich 
was more muscular, like Mary Lou Retton. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, Henrich pulled coach Al Fong into her Budapest hotel room and 
asked him repeatedly if he thought she was fat. Fong failed to reassure her. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Henrich ate only small salads and apples -- apart from binges of 
fast-food burgers and fries she threw up. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vaughn noted that Henrich had paid extraordinary attention to food since 
age 9, when she started training with Fong, years before the judge's comment. 
In therapy, Henrich recalled reading the sides of cereal boxes as a child to 
check protein and fat. 
</P>
<P>
 But she loved to cook. For family and friends, she piled plates high with 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the symptoms of people with eating disorders," Vaughn said. 
"They'll go out of their way to feed other people, but they don't feed 
themselves. The sight and the smells of the food teased and taunted Christy and 
set up many more problems. She was constantly saying, 'C'mon, have another 
piece of pie!' And all the time inside wanting it for herself but denying it, 
or taking it and not being able to stop with one piece, and after eating two or 
three going to vomit or use a lot of laxatives." 
</P>
<P>
 More significant than the judge's misinterpreted remark, Vaughn said, was a 
misplaced sense of responsibility that evolved out of Henrich's status as the 
center of attention in both her family and the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of support and energy Christy's family gave her was incredible. I 
mean, anything for Christy. But inside, she carried that as a burden," Vaughn 
said. "No matter how well she did, the message she gave herself was that it 
wasn't enough, it wasn't OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich felt guilt for all the sacrifices her family made and for taking 
attention from her older brother, Paul. She wanted the attention but felt shame 
at getting it, Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
 She agonized over failing her coach by missing the 1988 Olympic team by 0.118 
of a point. 
</P>
<P>
 "She felt shame about having the disease," Vaughn said, "and that she couldn't 
be the woman Bo (her fiance) wanted her to be. Yet Bo didn't put any of those 
messages on her. He loved her unconditionally. She put them on herself. She put 
everything on herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "One story she told me was that her mom had a migraine headache one night and 
was sick while driving her to gymnastics when she was around 10 years old. Her 
mom had to stop the van and get out and vomit, and Christy was right there 
saying, 'C'mon, Mom, c'mon, we're going to be late, I've got to go.' Christy 
had a lot of shame and guilt about those things." 
</P>
<P>
 The therapist continued: "When you don't feel good about yourself and you have 
a lot of shame . . . then a subconscious acting out of that is to punish 
yourself in some way." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn said she normally would never reveal discussions with a patient but 
felt it was important to disclose details of Henrich's ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christy and her mom, Sandy, told me I should talk about it if what they had 
gone through could help some other family," Vaughn said. "Her feelings of shame 
are more common than they are specific to just Christy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A week after her death, Henrich's bright red Toyota, with the license plate 
GMNAST, straddled the sidewalk in front of her parents' home on Wigwam Trail. 
Sandy and Paul Henrich, and Joseph (Bo) Moreno, almost their son-in-law, had 
agreed to talk with a reporter. But answering the door, the Henrichs apologized 
and canceled the interview on the advice of their lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Ralph A. Monaco said the grieving family would respond soon to the 
many requests for interviews. He asked about "remuneration," saying the family 
was badly strapped by medical bills. Eating disorders, categorized as 
psychiatric ills, receive limited insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Monaco said the family hoped "Christy's death will help lead 
to a greater public awareness of her illness and the difficulties and pressures 
encountered by young gymnasts in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Few reliable studies gauge the extent of the disease in the United States: 
estimates are that 1% of teen-age girls have anorexia nervosa, that 5-9% of 
college women have bulimia. One limited study by the American College of Sports 
Medicine found that up to 62% of female gymnasts have an eating disorder. With 
secrecy and denial part of the syndrome, those figures are probably low, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Gymnastics Federation conducts seminars for gymnasts, coaches and 
parents, and it has professionals available for counseling. None of that 
enabled Henrich to escape the traps pulling her down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich was so clever at concealment that neither her coach nor her parents 
noticed anything wrong for about a year and a half after she began virtually 
starving herself. 
</P>
<P>
 She had always been spunky and quick, popping back up on the bars as soon as 
she'd finished, practicing three routines for everyone else's one. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a determination about her," Fong said, "that fire in her eyes, that 
attitude that said, 'Hey, I can do this. Just watch me.' 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a poor back alignment, just born with it. And . . . she was not a 
very talented athlete. She didn't learn skills very quickly. She almost had a 
dyslexia about instruction. I'd say up, she'd think down. . . . It was very 
difficult working with her. But those are the kinds of obstacles she overcame 
through sheer hard work that allowed her to be as good as she was. And she was 
really good." 
</P>
<P>
 Her tolerance for pain allowed Henrich to overcome her body's decay for a 
while, even compete with a stress fracture at the 1989 World Championships. She 
was still the one the hundreds of kids at Fong's gym loved and looked up to, an 
apparently perfect leader who worked out before and after school, got up at 
4:30 a.m., went home at 9:30 p.m. What they didn't see was her bingeing on fast 
food or eating nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started noticing hints of a problem in 1989 when she was struggling, having 
trouble finishing skills that six months before she could do without even 
blinking an eye," Fong said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she returned from the World Championships, "her temperament had changed, 
where she was having fits of rage and frustration. It got real strange," he 
said. "It was really not good for the rest of the kids, but especially not good 
for Christy because she was going to hurt herself physically, the way she was 
throwing herself around. She'd say, 'I can't do it,' and she'd jump down, start 
crying, slam herself down on the ground in a rage." 
</P>
<P>
 Fong, "searching for everything and anything that might solve the problem," 
found research on eating disorders in which symptoms mirrored some of Christy's 
behavior. He began closely observing her when the team ate out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started seeing that she was only eating an apple while the rest of the kids 
were eating potatoes and pasta," he said. "That's when I started saying, man, 
we've got a problem here." 
</P>
<P>
 Fong knows he wasn't blameless. When Henrich began losing weight, he offered 
compliments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started seeing her really trim up, and we kept saying, 'Wow, Christy, you 
look great!' " Judges and other gymnasts echoed the praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was all the kind of reinforcement that would keep encouraging this type 
of behavior," Fong said. "But we didn't know. We had no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 When he did have an idea, Fong approached Henrich and her parents. The 
Henrichs "were shocked. They had no idea this was taking place," Fong said. 
They were also fiercely resistant, the coach added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents are looking for every excuse in the world, but plain and simple, 
they went through a period of denial." 
</P>
<P>
 When he confronted his star gymnast, "she broke down and started crying. I 
said, 'Hey, Christy. It's not too late. Let's work together and let's solve 
this thing. I don't know how to do it because I'm not the professional. But 
let's call up the people that can do something about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fong contacted the psychologist and nutritionist for the national team, who 
phoned Henrich and her parents and set them up to see experts in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her parents went with it for a little bit, but Christy hated it, absolutely 
hated it. After a while, she just quit going," Fong said. "Christy was doing a 
Great Impostor thing at home, eating right at the house. Her mom said, 'Oh 
yeah, she's eating good.' But then Christy, I guess, would go to the bathroom 
and throw it all up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Henrich was refusing help, Fong barred her from his gym. She 
retired at the end of the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Henrich called Fong and announced, "Al, 
I'm really jazzed. I want to train for '96. I know I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fong told her again she would have to resolve the eating disorders. She never 
called back. 
</P>
<P>
 That December, Sandy Henrich called Kathy Kelly of USA Gymnastics, which 
coordinates international competition for the national team, to say they were 
in "dire straits, physically as well as the family financially, with a 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
 She named no disease, just told Kelly that Christy was in the hospital, that 
she weighed less than 70 pounds, that they "almost lost her" and that they 
needed help. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds were raised and a luncheon benefit was arranged last summer in Kansas 
City. Kim Zmeskal, Nadia Comaneci and other top gymnasts showed up. So, too, 
did Vaughn, who was making some progress with Henrich. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point," Vaughn said, "she made a core choice to live, and I said to 
her, 'Now, Christy, if you choose to live, every choice you make has to support 
that choice to live. And that means fighting against this disease.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She had little fight left in her, but on the day of the benefit she was deeply 
moved by the friends who had gathered. 
</P>
<P>
 "They let Christy out of the hospital to come to the luncheon and she 
appreciated knowing that we all loved her, not just because she was a gymnast," 
Kelly said. "I kind of felt that was a turning point. I felt like, 'Good, now 
she understands and it doesn't matter about her sport, it just matters about 
her.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, Henrich quit working with Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christy was tired," Vaughn said. "She was tired of therapy. She was tired of 
the hospitalizations, being away from home so long. She was tired of not being 
a 'normal' person. And, as I see a lot with people, they settle for better 
instead of well. She had some hope and was doing real well, and that's when she 
said, 'I can do it on my own now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But she couldn't. In December, she told Kelly she ate no more than an apple a 
day, sometimes only a slice. Her weight dropped to 52 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, a reporter phoned Henrich and asked her how much she weighed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I threw away my scale," she said weakly. "I didn't weigh myself this 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
 "How much do you think you weigh?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if I had to guess, I'd say about 65." 
</P>
<P>
 The way she said it made the number sound optimistically high. She wanted to 
get back into shape, she said, but wouldn't return to therapy. She was going to 
do it on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there one reason why you have these eating disorders?" 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of my mind," she said after a long pause, "food is still a 
poison." 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you eat, then?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," she answered, "I really don't."

ARGENTINES STILL CRY FOR EVITA, DEFEND HER IMAGE; POPULISM: OLIVER STONE'S PLAN 
TO FILM MUSICAL ABOUT THE FORMER FIRST LADY STIRS PASSIONS EVEN TODAY. HIS 
INTENTION TO PORTRAY HEROINE OF THE POOR IN UNFLATTERING LIGHT CAUSED PRESIDENT 
CARLOS MENEM TO BAR STONE FROM USING GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN FILM.

 On most days, the bronze bust of Eva Peron seems forgotten, kept company only 
by the weeds sprouting below. 
</P>
<P>
 Now and then -- on her birthday, Peronist Day and the anniversary of her death 
-- devotees brighten the roadside monument with roses and wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy of Eva Peron and her husband, the late President Juan Peron, faded 
as time passed. And in recent years, President Carlos Menem, head of the 
Peronist Party, reversed the old nationalist policies in the name of a "new" 
Peronism. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Oliver Stone came to town to shoot the movie version of Andrew Lloyd 
Webber's hit musical "Evita," which depicts its heroine as a power-hungry woman 
who slept around, and all that began to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Even 42 years after she died of cancer at age 33, such an image of Eva Peron 
is heresy to many Argentines, particularly the "shirtless ones" who venerated 
her in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "People see her as an idol, a respected figure," said Horacio Raffo, a popcorn 
vendor in Ciudad Evita, a working-class area 15 miles west of Buenos Aires 
named for her. "If they make a film that says she's a prostitute, well, people 
here can't take that." 
</P>
<P>
 Over a convivial lunch, Menem originally told Stone he would have access to 
government buildings, including the presidential offices. After a week of 
complaints, he decided the story "distorts historical truth." The government 
now says the American director can make the film in Argentina, but not inside 
any government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be like letting Oliver Stone use the White House to say Kennedy was 
a homosexual," said Patricia Bullrich, a Peronist congresswoman. "What we're 
saying is, if you're going to insult my mother, do it in the street, not in my 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 The real Evita was born in Buenos Aires province, moved to the capital at age 
15 and became a radio, stage and film actress. 
</P>
<P>
 She was about 25 when she met Peron, an ambitious army officer twice her age. 
They were married a year later, in 1945, and a year after that he was elected 
president, making his wife the most powerful woman in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 She became the champion of workers and the poor. Her Eva Peron Foundation 
built schools and hospitals and bought gifts for needy children. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man who is 55 years old today might remember the foundation giving him a 
soccer ball or a trip to the beach when he was a child," said Felix Luna, a 
leading historian. "So now he romanticizes Evita and that whole period." 
</P>
<P>
 She was adored by the "resentidos," the have-nots who hate the rich. "Shall we 
burn down the Barrio Norte?" she would ask them at rallies, referring to a 
wealthy section of Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 In her autobiography, "The Reason for My Life," which was required reading in 
primary schools, she wrote: "When I discovered that there were poor people and 
rich people in the world, the strange thing is that the existence of the poor 
didn't cause me as much pain as the knowledge that, at the same time, there 
were people who were rich." 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably, rich Argentines despised Evita, calling her a phony populist. 
</P>
<P>
 "She always provoked heated political debate," said Congressman Jorge Matzkin, 
leader of the Peronist bloc in the Chamber of Deputies. "After 42 years, the 
intensity of emotion has lessened, but it's still there." 
</P>
<P>
 Matzkin helps keep it alive by hanging a portrait of Evita on the wall outside 
his office. In a recent protest march, metal workers wore plastic headbands 
inscribed with "Evita Immortal" and drawings of her and Juan Peron. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists visit Evita's mausoleum at Recoleta, the cemetery of the powerful. 
Her body has been carefully preserved, but only family members are permitted to 
view it. 
</P>
<P>
 Luna, the historian, said Evita "belongs to Argentine mythology" along with 
the late tango singer Carlos Gardel and, "30 or 40 years from now," soccer star 
Diego Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone becomes a myth," he said, "real history isn't relevant."

IT'S COW-COW BOOGIE ON DELHI ROADS

<P>
 Lay off the horn, slow down, and above all, don't wear red. 
</P>
<P>
 The cows are back on New Delhi's streets, and not by popular demand. But did 
that ever stop them? 
</P>
<P>
 Not last year, not this year. Thousands of cows have invaded the city, 
snarling traffic and making children pass within inches of cows and bulls as 
they walk to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Crashing into a cow, or even nudging one aside with a bumper, is sinful for 
most Hindus, who worship the beasts as "go-matas," or mother cows. 
</P>
<P>
 They wander down New Delhi's streets all year, but during good monsoons -- 
like the current one -- they take to the warmth of the roads in great numbers 
to avoid their rain-soaked sheds.

FROM JUNGLE FIGHTERS TO TOUR GUIDES; PHILIPPINES: NEGRITOS TAUGHT SURVIVAL 
SKILLS TO MARINES BEFORE U.S. LEFT SUBIC BAY BASE. NOW, AREA IS A CENTER FOR 
THOSE WHO WANT TO EXPERIENCE ONE OF THE LAST AREAS OF RAIN FOREST ON LUZON 
ISLAND.

 Negrito tribesmen used to teach U.S. Marines how to survive in the jungle. Now 
the Americans are gone, so they guide tourists through the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Negritos worked as instructors in the Jungle Warfare School at Subic Bay naval 
base until it closed in November, 1992, putting them and 40,000 other Filipinos 
out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Subic, 50 miles west of Manila, was turned over to the Philippines and 
converted into a free port and tourism center. Negritos now guide tourists 
through the 32,000-acre jungle, one of the last areas of tropical rain forest 
on Luzon Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Working as guides enables the Negritos, the original inhabitants of the 
Philippines, to maintain their ancient way of life. The tours give visitors an 
opportunity to explore and appreciate the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around 60 people are involved in the ecological tours, including about 40 
jungle guides," said tour coordinator Jojo Umali. "We want to preserve the 
jungle, so we don't let people hike or camp without a guide." 
</P>
<P>
 The Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority charges the equivalent of $9.25 for a 
jungle hike and $16.50 to camp in a jungle clearing. The authority keeps $1.85 
from each fee and the rest goes into a fund, administered by Negrito elders, 
that is the sole source of income for Subic Bay's 1,800 Negritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Umali said 200 to 300 people visit the jungle each week. He said most are 
Filipinos and others come from Taiwan, Japan, America and Europe. Guides lead 
them along routes ranging from short walks on level ground to arduous climbs on 
which hikers pull themselves up steep slopes with hanging vines. 
</P>
<P>
 Trails so narrow that hikers must walk single file weave through dense stands 
of bamboo, lush ferns and rare hardwood trees. Wild orchids grow along the 
moss-covered banks of jungle streams. 
</P>
<P>
 Campsites are simple clearings without running water or other amenities. 
Negrito guides stay overnight with campers to make sure they do not litter or 
build unauthorized fires. The survival of the Negrito culture depends on the 
survival of the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Negritos, a race of pygmies known in the Philippines as Aetas or Agtas, are 
ethnically related to the Melanesians of the South Pacific. After being driven 
into the mountains and forests, they survived by learning to use the thousands 
of plants and animals that thrive in the jungle for food, medicine and weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Americans controlled Subic, they hired Negritos as trackers to find 
the poachers and illegal loggers who were responsible for destroying most of 
the Philippine rain forest. Negritos perform the same function today, in 
addition to their work as guides. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't care for this forest, we will lose our livelihood," said Domingo 
Dizon, 28, a guide who worked at the Jungle Warfare School. "Our lives depend 
on this forest. The Americans taught us that." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pamulaklakin settlement, a collection of thatched huts along a jungle 
ridge, Negritos show visitors how they have adapted to the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are Aeta matches," Sozimo dela Cruz, 34, explained as he rubbed two 
bamboo sticks together. Moments later, flames rose from bamboo shavings under 
the sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 Juice from thin-leaved cover grass serves as a snakebite remedy. Cinchona 
bark, the source of quinine, is used to treat malaria. Other plants are boiled 
into a drink to give mothers strength after childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are poor," Dela Cruz said. "We don't have anything, so we use these plants 
for our living." 
</P>
<P>
 Negritos use bamboo, which abounds in the jungle, to fashion drinking cups and 
as fuel to cook rice, the staple diet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We eat with our fingers, but the Marines didn't like to, so we learned how to 
make spoons and knives out of bamboo for them," Dela Cruz said.

JANIS JOPLIN'S SISTER GIVES A PIECE OF HER HEART TO FANS WITH BOOK, PLAY; 
MUSIC: THE ROCK LEGEND'S LETTERS HOME FORM THE BASIS FOR YEARS OF WONDERING, 
RESEARCHING AND WRITING. FAN REACTION HAS BEEN GRATIFYING.

<P>
 During her play's five-week run in Denver, Laura Joplin attended 15 
performances, watching audience reaction and listening to comments made at 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, she spent five years working on the book by the same name, "Love, 
Janis," about her sister, Janis Joplin, the rock legend who died of a heroin 
overdose in 1970 at the age of 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep thinking, well, that's done," Laura Joplin said. "But it's never 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 Her sunny Denver house is decorated with pictures of her daughter, glass art 
by her brother and paintings by her sister, Janis. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Joplin grew up in Port Arthur, Tex., and was 17 when her sister left 
home. She has lived in Denver for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Joplin has a Ph.D. in education but has spent most of her working time since 
her daughter's birth managing Janis' estate and writing "Love, Janis," a 
biography about her sister published in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, it seems as though engaging with her sister's short life so 
intensely these past seven years has made Janis' life and times more vivid for 
Laura, instead of laying it to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Janis Joplin left Port Arthur when Laura was a junior in high school. She 
headed to California, where she burst onto the music scene with a performance 
at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her biggest hits included "Piece of My Heart," "Try (Just a Little Bit 
Harder)," "Cry Baby" and "Get It While You Can." 
</P>
<P>
 Since her death, Janis Joplin has become a legend, one of the live-hard, 
die-young '60s rock icons like Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison. Hendrix died only 
weeks before Joplin, also of a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look (at the 1960s) and say, 'I'm glad that's over.' It's not over," 
Laura said. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalls a trip to California with her family after Janis' Monterey 
performance, which had been written up in the national newsmagazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got there and realized there's a whole new world out there, a new energy," 
Laura said. 
</P>
<P>
 But far from being over, the "new world" of the '60s and many of its lessons 
are still intact, she believes. Among them, she said, are feminism and lessons 
in peace, collective decision-making and education. 
</P>
<P>
 Also far from over is Laura's need to explore the person behind the legend of 
Janis Joplin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was time for me to look back, just like our culture is looking back at the 
'60s," Laura said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her decision to write the book was not a momentous one, Laura recalls. It 
began at a January, 1988, ceremony in Port Arthur to honor local musicians, 
among them her sister. The event drew huge crowds, which came by the busload 
from as far as Canada to pay tribute to a woman who had nothing nice to say 
about her hometown when she was alive. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the book project, Laura has one word to sum it up: "Long." 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how much research you do, you always want to do more," she said. 
"Initially, I thought, 'I was there.' But you don't remember. I had impressions 
and memories and feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the book was done, Laura pushed to turn it into a play. The play closed 
at the end of May after five weeks of good reviews and record-breaking 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are fans of Janis for various reasons, and for whatever reason, the 
show brought it back and allowed them to revisit," Laura said. "I wanted people 
to re-appreciate her music; I wanted people to learn something about her as a 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 The play served both goals, with Janis played by two actresses. One sang and 
performed, portraying the public person. Another actress portrayed the private 
Janis, sometimes scared, sometimes depressed, but always bubbling with 
intelligence and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura enjoyed watching those who attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a number of families," she said. "There were people who are young 
and hip today bringing their parents, and there were people who went through 
the '60s who would bring their kids or their parents and say, 'Can't you see, 
finally?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Laura hopes the play, which she is working to bring to other cities, will 
strike the same chord it did with audiences in Denver, who gave every 
performance a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audience's feelings were real important to me for resolving something -- 
I don't know what," she said.

DETERMINED DETECTIVE GATHERS CLUES, MAKES ARREST IN 13-YEAR-OLD MURDER; NEW 
YORK: ONE POLICE OFFICER REFUSED TO GIVE UP ON THE CASE, IN WHICH A DOCTOR WAS 
SHOT FOR THE $5 IN HIS WALLET. 
</P>

<P>
 As tears ran down their faces and soaked their surgical masks, the doctors did 
everything they could for the surgeon who'd worked with them in that very 
emergency room earlier that very night. 
</P>
<P>
 But they could not save Dr. John Chase Wood Jr., who went out for supper and 
came back with a bullet through his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Nov. 2, 1981. Wood, 31, was walking back to Columbia Presbyterian 
Medical Center from his apartment after dinner with his pregnant wife. He wore 
doctor's whites and a green scrub shirt. Someone shot him for his wallet, which 
contained all of $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Even to crime-jaded New Yorkers, the slaughter of the pediatrician-in-training 
seemed like the bombing of a Red Cross hospital. Police assigned about 60 
detectives to the case and told them to work as long as they had to. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Jerry Giorgio, fresh from helping solve the backstage murder of a 
violinist at the Metropolitan Opera. He soon concluded the Wood case would not 
be solved easily: no reliable eyewitness accounts, no murder weapon, no prime 
suspects. It reminded him of a jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Wood's prospects were even grimmer. In six months she had become a 
nurse, a bride, an expectant mother. And now, a 24-year-old widow. 
</P>
<P>
 After a while she returned to work at the hospital, because that was part of 
the world she and John had shared. But one day she started crying and couldn't 
stop; a patient had asked why she always looked so sad. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Wood and Jerry Giorgio would not meet for 13 years, but each had 
embarked on a search. He was looking for pieces to a puzzle, she for a new 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 They also shared this question: How long would it take? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence in case No. 1744 started out in a single folder. 
</P>
<P>
 Giorgio and the others interviewed hundreds of people in the weeks after the 
shooting. They tracked down scores of tips, shot down as many rumors. The 
neighborhood around the hospital was tough, and they weaved their way through a 
miasma of street names and slang, of hearsay and mendacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The first break came in 1982, when Giorgio was interviewing an informer about 
the highly publicized killing of a showgirl on Manhattan's East Side. The 
informer fingered Patrick McDowell, and said he thought McDowell shot "that 
doctor," too. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell, 17, told Giorgio he didn't shoot Wood. He admitted trying to rob the 
showgirl, but said the shooting was an accident. He pleaded guilty to 
manslaughter, and went off to serve 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wood case stagnated until Nov. 9, 1983, when an anonymous caller to a 
police crime tips line identified McDowell and two other men as Wood's 
assailants. The caller never called back. 
</P>
<P>
 Years passed. Giorgio's first partner on the case retired, then his second. 
The case bounced from one prosecutor to another. Giorgio was all that was left 
of the detective army of late '81, and he had lots of other cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But Giorgio says he never forgot John Wood or Patrick McDowell, never stopped 
poring over the file, turning the facts over in a corner of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason might have been that the Giorgios had a child born with water on 
the brain who survived thanks to three operations. Jerry Giorgio knew what good 
a pediatric surgeon could do, and knew what his loss meant. 
</P>
<P>
 He was convinced his original impression was correct: The Wood case was a 
jigsaw puzzle. So he continued to fill his file with countless pieces of 
information, regardless of how they fit. 
</P>
<P>
 He compiled a "hit parade," a list of everyone related to the case. Whenever a 
hit parader was hauled into the precinct house, he or she would get an audience 
with Giorgio, who was ready to trade leniency for information or cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 The file grew year after year, until Giorgio had to move its contents into a 
big brown cardboard box marked "CITY OF NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT." 
</P>
<P>
 By now, Giorgio had no illusions about his prospects. McDowell's arrest would 
have to be based "on what people say they were told, or what they say they 
saw." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the witnesses would be street people or criminals whose stories began, 
"I was getting high. . . ." or "We was strippin' a car. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have a priest or a bank president who was passing by," he says. "We 
had to work with what we had." 
</P>
<P>
 By April of 1992, when McDowell was paroled, what they had still wasn't 
enough. It began to look like the case would outlast Giorgio, 58, who joined 
the force two years after the Giants left for San Francisco. He'd been eligible 
for retirement longer than most of his colleagues had been detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 If this was a jigsaw puzzle, maybe it was like the kind you find in a summer 
rental home -- too many missing pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Chase Wood III was born in March, 1982, after his mother had moved to a 
quiet neighborhood in suburban New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 A New York Times reporter who visited the Woods that summer reported that 
little Johnny had a cleft chin like his father's, and that Diana Wood had taken 
up her husband's instrument, the French horn. 
</P>
<P>
 She also had decided she wanted to be a doctor -- not for her husband, as some 
surmised, but for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 25 years old and I didn't know what to do with myself," she recalls. "I 
got this idea I'd go to medical school to have something for me, something that 
no one could take away." 
</P>
<P>
 She had to take some preliminary courses in calculus and physics, but 
Columbia's medical school admitted her and waived tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives helped her care for Johnny, and in 1988 Diana Newton Wood -- 
granddaughter, daughter and widow of physicians -- got her own M.D. After four 
years of hospital training in anesthesiology, she joined the Lahey Clinic 
outside Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 If there had been little time to grieve over her husband's death, there was 
even less to mull the fate of his murderer: "For a long time it didn't matter 
that much to me. He'd taken what he'd taken, and nothing was going to bring 
John back." For a decade she heard nothing from the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, early in 1993, she got a call from a Detective Giorgio, who claimed to 
have a break in the case. He called a few more times, but a year later he still 
hadn't made an arrest. The prosecutors always wanted more evidence; to them, 
the puzzle still looked like Cubism. 
</P>
<P>
 She was home the night of Friday, July 29, when the phone rang. It was Jerry 
Giorgio. The pieces finally fit; he'd made an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Giorgio won't give details, but he says his persistence paid off in early 1993 
when someone came into the station house with information implicating McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year later, he says, "a guy I'd been waiting to get pulled in finally 
got pulled in, and he's cooperating." This man allegedly said McDowell spoke to 
him about Wood's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 He says prosecutors were ready to draw up charges when, on the morning of July 
29, patrolmen arrested Patrick McDowell for threatening people on the street 
with a 9mm pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 At the precinct McDowell greeted Giorgio by name and said, in referring to the 
Metropolitan Opera and other cases, "I've been following your career." 
</P>
<P>
 Giorgio could have said the same, for he'd been watching McDowell from afar 
for years, waiting for him to slip. Instead he told him, "I guess you know what 
we're going to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 They sat in a dirty yellow cinderblock interrogation room. McDowell didn't 
confess, but Giorgio says he got a statement "that may trip him up" -- reveal 
something only someone on the scene that night would know. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Giorgio lives to tell a relative, "We've made an arrest." But Diana Wood took 
the news quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 37, she had never remarried, and only recently began to really face the 
loss she'd endured. Now this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't quite know what to say because I had mixed feelings," she said. "It 
reminded me of a person who was different from the one I am now. I had a sense 
of not wanting to go back to all that again." 
</P>
<P>
 An arrest was merely an allegation, a prelude to a trial that would revive the 
past and could clear the suspect. But, the widow concluded, a trial might also 
provide a sense of closure. At any rate, she'd be there. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day she told Johnny: "I have some news that's going to seem good and 
sad at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old was unequivocally delighted; the bad guy was caught. But later 
in the weekend, just before he had to head back to camp, Johnny was somber, his 
mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I see what you meant.' It had reminded him of the father he never 
had."

RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT SEEN IN NUCLEAR SMUGGLING

<P>
 German police fear some Russian officials are involved in the smuggling of 
nuclear material, a senior aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd Schmidbauer, Kohl's intelligence coordinator, made the comment in 
discussing why police did not notify their Russian counterparts of a sting 
designed to collar a suspected nuclear smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't an accusation, but rather the point that must be discussed in 
Moscow -- working together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidbauer was to fly to Moscow on Saturday with Germany's top intelligence 
chiefs and nuclear scientists in an effort to coordinate actions against 
nuclear smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Moscow have denied that weapons-grade nuclear materials have been 
spirited out of Russia.

HAIRY VETCH FREES FARMS OF PLASTIC MANTLE; ECOLOGY: RESEARCHER USES COVER CROP 
AS A WAY TO KEEP WEEDS DOWN AND MOISTURE IN THE SOIL. IT ALSO BOOSTS PLANT 
YIELDS AND MAKES CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS UNNECESSARY.

<P>
 Every year, Florida vegetable farmers lay enough plastic sheeting on fields to 
tie a black cummerbund 90 times around Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant physiologist Aref Abdul-Baki believes he has a better way to keep weeds 
down and moisture in the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past five autumns, the Department of Agriculture scientist has planted 
hairy vetch, a winter annual cover crop. Every spring, he mows the crop and 
grows long rows of tomato plants that are greener, bushier and produce more 
fruit than those grown under plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not adding anything to the soil by using that plastic," Abdul-Baki 
said, and the plastic isn't biodegradable. "Where are we going to bury it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Plastic is the most commonly used ground cover in commercial vegetable 
farming. Florida farmers alone use enough plastic every year to stretch about 2 
million miles, Abdul-Baki said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the era of plastic, the Romans and ancient Greeks used hairy vetch 
as "green manure," plowing it into their fields, said Abdul-Baki, who won an 
Agricultural Research Service award in July for his vetch research. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, the cover crop, which 
resembles a shaggy vine and can grow branches up to 7 feet long, is planted in 
the fall. It is mowed in early May, the same day seeds are planted, and left on 
top of the soil, keeping weeds down and moisture in, he said. As the ground 
cover decomposes, it nourishes the soil -- so much so, Abdul-Baki said, that it 
makes chemical fertilizers unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The plants grown on the hairy vetch look healthier and have more foliage -- 
which hides extra fruit, Abdul-Baki said. The plants grown in plastic-covered 
earth appear less robust, with wilted bottom leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the five years Abdul-Baki has conducted the experiment, never have the 
tomato plants grown on vetch had a worse yield than those grown using plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best year, we had twice as much yield under hairy vetch as under 
plastic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's another benefit to using hairy vetch. It's cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying, installing and removing the plastic costs farmers about $750 per acre, 
Abdul-Baki said. The vetch costs about $35 an acre to plant and saves on 
fertilizer costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until I started doing the vetch that I really started taking off," 
said Norma Wilson, who has operated a small organic farm in Lovettsville, Va., 
for eight years. "There's so many positives to using it." 
</P>
<P>
 The vetch, which she has used for the last two years on tomatoes, corn and 
squash, reduced her overhead and allowed her to put more resources into 
marketing her vegetables, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground cover is also "a haven for the beneficial insects" who then keep 
the "bad guys" off her vegetables, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe more important for Wilson, the vetch's root system holds onto the 
nitrogen in the soil, reducing the amount that runs into the nearby Potomac 
River and flows down to the Chesapeake Bay, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The method also has its place on larger commercial farms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're actively looking for better ways to grow our crops that are more 
environmentally friendly," said Brennan Starkey of Starkey Farms on the Eastern 
Shore. Hairy vetch is one of the options being considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,000-acre commercial farm, which sells produce to stands and 
supermarkets, this year tried the vetch method on about 20% of the tomato crop, 
Starkey said. Next year, the farm could use it on part of the sweet corn crop, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're impressed with what we've seen so far," he said.

SCHOOL LUNCH MENU BOOSTS COMMODITIES; HEALTH: AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT TELLS 
SCHOOLS TO LOWER FAT, CHOLESTEROL AND SODIUM, BUT CRITICS SAY PROGRAM IS DRIVEN 
BY AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS FIRST AND NUTRITION SECOND. 
</P>

<P>
 Pat Holstein runs the school meals program for a rural school district near 
Columbia, S.C., and, thanks to a special program, can spend 15% of her federal 
food dollars on fresh fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen percent is a lot higher than the roughly 4% that the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture allocates to fresh produce when the department buys food for the 
nation's 15,000 school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the department opposes the special program that gives people like 
Holstein money to shop locally for the best buys on produce, meat and other 
foods. The department says that it should do the shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the Commodity Letters of Credit program sounds strange from a 
department trying to improve the $650 million or so worth of food it buys each 
year for distribution to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounded no stranger than the deference paid to the department's commodity 
programs when Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy and Assistant Secretary Ellen 
Haas on June 8 announced their regulations to improve school lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than set new nutritional guidelines for the kind of foods that the 
department purchases, the department told schools to lower the amount of fat, 
saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium in lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also announced an agreement between the agency in charge of 
nutrition and those in charge of marketing commodities to work on the quality 
of USDA purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their approach to improving the commodities looks like a pretty soft 
approach, that they're making a bureaucratic commitment to improve the 
commodities, but it's unclear exactly how improved they will be," said Michael 
Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The department, even before Espy and former consumer advocate Haas came on 
board, had been working to lower the amount of fat in its meat and dairy 
products, and the levels of salt and sugar in canned produce. 
</P>
<P>
 And although 4% doesn't sound like a lot of fresh produce, it's double what 
the department was purchasing before Espy took over in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, critics maintain that the commodity program is driven by 
agricultural interests first and nutrition second. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the 1946 law that created the school lunch program also specified 
that it try to promote U.S. farm goods. So if a drought drives up feed prices, 
forcing more hogs and cattle to early slaughter, the Agricultural Marketing 
Service will buy more beef and pork for school lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas, in recent testimony before a House Agriculture subcommittee, noted that 
the "positive market effect of these commodity programs is most important to 
retain." 
</P>
<P>
 Haas nearly echoed testimony from groups like the American Meat Institute when 
she noted that commodity purchases account for no more than 20% of the nearly 
$5 billion that schools spend on food. 
</P>
<P>
 And the setting of general nutritional goals, leaving it up to schools to meet 
them how they see fit, and the refusal to single out any kind of food as bad, 
pleased the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very concerned that there was going to be a huge amount of effort to 
replace processed foods with fresh," said Juanita Duggan, lobbyist for the 
National Food Processors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite complaints about the nutritional quality of the kinds of foods they 
receive from the department, school food service administrators need the 
commodity programs and the agriculture groups that support them. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such an ally, schools are more vulnerable to cuts in their federal 
budget for commodities, the American School Food Service indicated in recent 
testimony.

MONK'S RESTAURANT CATERS TO THE FORTUNATE TO FEED NEEDY CHILDREN; RELIGION: 
BENEDICTINE BROTHER SERVES UP HAUTE CUISINE IN NEW HAVEN, CONN. BUT IT'S 
YOUNGSTERS RELYING ON HIS SOUP KITCHEN WHO ARE THE IMPORTANT CUSTOMERS.

 Wearing a woolen robe, a bearded Benedictine monk scurries about a steamy 
kitchen, making sure the bread rises evenly, the sauce is thick and the beef 
Burgundy gets the right amount of thyme. 
</P>
<P>
 Brother Denys Cormier is cooking for the fortunate to feed the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Wandering Monk's Guild and Bakery, his customers rely on him for such 
delights as marinated chicken and pork chops, roasted and seasoned potatoes, 
fresh cucumber salad and rich truffles. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who truly depend on him are not here: the 1,130 children in the 
city's ghettos who receive food shipped daily from the monk's soup kitchen 
across the street from the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to make money because funds are so low. It's pretty amazing: People 
don't believe children are really hungry in America," Cormier said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no bill for the gourmet fare. The roughly 120 patrons who crowd 
inside each day find a small wicker bowl set on each table. A tiny sign asks 
for a minimum $5 donation. On a recent day, the bowl overflowed with $20 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 That money flows across the street to a soup kitchen that provides sandwiches, 
fruits, juices and snacks to needy children, Cormier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters never go to the soup kitchen. It comes to them, delivered to 
schools and local social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want kids to learn that a soup kitchen is a way of life, and we're 
trying to develop the family nucleus sitting down and eating together," Cormier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 New Haven resident Sandra Metcalfe says she frequents the restaurant because 
of the food -- and the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids that he's helping are in our city. I see them as my responsibility, 
and a lot of us don't know how to help. Brother Denys is providing us with a 
way to do that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The calm mood and simple decor fit with the brothers' mission. 
</P>
<P>
 No alcohol is served and furnishings are Spartan. The long, wooden tables 
might be found in a monastery. Gregorian chants play in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Cormier likes to stick with the theme: He sometimes serves monkfish or hermit 
cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Cormier and his staff of six, most of them volunteers, serve a continental 
breakfast of coffee, breads, jams and pastries. At lunchtime, customers help 
themselves to a bountiful, all-you-can-eat feast. At night, the staff caters to 
private parties and business meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 And as people leisurely chat at the sidewalk tables, shaded from the midday 
sun by oversized, forest-green umbrellas, across the street a white van pulls 
out of the driveway of the soup kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Buster didn't realize the restaurant and the soup kitchen were related 
the first time she came in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just was walking by and wanted to see what they had to eat," she said. "It 
made it kind of better when I found out what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wandering Monk was the original site of the soup kitchen. But with the 
restaurant's opening, Cormier's Emmaus Community of St. Benedict moved the 
kitchen across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a monk opening a restaurant is not new. Cormier says it's common 
for monks in Europe to have restaurants to support monasteries. The difference 
is that here the money is going to the children. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu varies depending on Cormier's middle-of-the-night inspirations, but 
he usually sticks to a combination of French and northern Italian cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never went to culinary school, but I'm gifted with insomnia, so I read 
cookbooks at night. I just get ideas and create," he said.

N.C. MAKES PUNISHMENT FIT THE BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM CLAIBORNE, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the face of increased crime and out-of-control prison costs, judges in 
North Carolina's criminal courts in October will begin using a simple, one-page 
chart of letters and numbers to dispense justice that -- quite literally -- 
makes the punishment fit the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially called the "felony punishment chart," but known by prosecutors and 
criminals as "the grid," the chart is the centerpiece of an innovative 
sentencing law that has put North Carolina at the forefront of a nascent but 
increasingly popular concept of criminal justice: balancing prison sentences 
with available cell capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, states have been turning to sentencing guidelines in an 
attempt to gain control over rapidly escalating prison populations. Minnesota 
pioneered this approach, and presumptive sentencing rules have been enacted in 
at least 16 other states. 
</P>
<P>
 With budgets strained to the breaking point by rising health-care costs and 
other social programs, states have been taking a second look at the hard-line 
anti-crime measures and mandatory minimum sentences they enacted in the 1980s 
-- with little regard for future prison costs -- and are examining more 
economical alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 States and counties spend $25 billion a year for corrections, 85% of which 
goes to building and operating prisons, and only 11% of which is spent for 
community-based corrections such as probation and day reporting centers. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina has spent $550 million since 1985 to build prison space for an 
additional 16,600 inmates, and the Corrections Department's operations budget 
has grown from $195 million in 1985 to $472 million last year. But North 
Carolina's sentencing structure, unlike those of most states, is a 
hard-and-fast list that either has to be followed by judges or scaled down by 
the Legislature to conform to available prison resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as "structured sentencing" or "capacity-based sentencing," the system 
recognizes the impossibility of building prisons fast enough to keep up with 
the influx of offenders. The new system also acknowledges the state's inability 
to imprison most offenders for anywhere near the duration of the sentences the 
courts have been handing down. 
</P>
<P>
 While abolishing parole for all new offenders and lengthening sentences for 
violent criminals and repeat offenders, the new law will reduce prison 
sentences an average of 80% to conform more closely to the length of time that 
inmates actually are behind bars at present. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing is setting priorities. We're saying we will use our prisons 
for violent offenders and career offenders. The converse of that, of course, is 
that we will have to punish the others in other ways," said Superior Court 
Judge Thomas W. Ross, chairman of the state's Sentencing and Policy Advisory 
Commission, which proposed the reforms enacted last year by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The "other ways" are community-based alternatives such as closely supervised 
probation, day reporting centers, halfway houses, boot camps, drug-treatment 
facilities, electronically monitored house arrest, fines and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 But the heart of the new law is the grid, a compilation of ranges of minimum 
and maximum sentences for 10 categories of felonies that are matched to a 
defendant's criminal record through a point system. 
</P>
<P>
 On the left side of the chart is a list of crime categories, ranging from 
Level A (first-degree murder) to Level I (fraud, forgery and lesser drug 
offenses). The numbers across the top correspond to the number of points a 
defendant has accumulated through prior convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to impose a sentence, a judge matches the severity of the crime to 
the defendant's prior record to find a square containing the corresponding 
sentence range. An offender must serve at least the minimum sentence listed. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Level D, which includes first-degree burglary and armed robbery, 
has a first-offender range of 44 to 55 months without aggravating or mitigating 
circumstances. The total range for Level D is from 33 months for a first 
offender with mitigating circumstances to 158 months for a multiple offender 
with aggravating circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 First and second offenders of some nonviolent felonies can, at the judge's 
discretion, be given suspended sentences provided they complete an alternative 
punishment, such as intensive probation, house arrest or boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Persons convicted of first-degree murder will continue to receive a death 
sentence or life without parole, and repeat offenders convicted of first-degree 
rape can get life without parole. Drug traffickers will continue to receive 
pre-existing, mandatory minimum sentences.

 Indian customs officers seized more than 30,000 insects from the baggage of 
two departing Germans at New Delhi international airport, newspapers reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Customs officials said the two were detained after a tip and were expected to 
be charged under a wildlife protection act.

RESEARCHERS DIG GARBAGE, FLESH OUT COLONIAL BOSTON HISTORY

 John Carnes, an 18th-Century pewter-smith who lived in the city's North End, 
married twice, had 14 children with his first wife and paid for one son's 
tuition at Harvard with pewter forks and knives. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians have known all that for a long time, thanks to various documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're sorting through his garbage to learn his shoe size and what he ate 
for dinner. Looks like he had a healthy ego too. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had wine bottles with a seal with his own name," said Elena Decima, 
project manager for a company digging up the remains of an old colonial 
neighborhood. "Usually you just had initials . . . so he must have thought well 
of himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The discoveries are part of more than 150,000 artifacts recovered from beneath 
a parking lot in the city's North End. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of archeologists is examining and preserving remnants of the 
2-square-block area, which needs to be cleared to make way for the $7.7-billion 
Central Artery-Third Harbor Tunnel, the costliest highway project in the 
nation's history. They dug 3 to 6 feet under the lot to find the crumbled walls 
and drains. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the items have been found in about a half-dozen brick privies, 
all-purpose outhouses and garbage dumps that residents used in the 1600s and 
early 1700s, said Decima of Timelines Inc. They include parts of leather shoes, 
long-stem clay pipes, bottles for herbal medicines, surgical instruments, bone 
combs and buttons, a George I halfpenny, animal bones and china fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the North End was an upper-middle-class neighborhood of 
homeowners who kept stables of horses, Decima said. As the city grew, many of 
those families moved out, leaving the North End to tradesmen and tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 When Timelines excavates the last privy this summer, the archeologists hope to 
find parasites, evidence of diseases the colonists may have suffered. They also 
will examine pollen to find out what kinds of plants the colonists grew. 
</P>
<P>
 Decima hopes that researchers will finish preserving and cataloguing their 
finds by early next year.

NUTRITIONAL ROLE SEEN IN SPREAD OF AIDS

 Selenium, a nutrient found in whole grains and seafood, could help prolong the 
lives of people who test positive for the AIDS virus, a researcher said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 University of Georgia researcher Will Taylor said an analysis of the genetic 
code of HIV, published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, suggests a key 
role for selenium in the biochemical makeup of the human immunodeficiency 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
 A potential role for the chemical element could help explain the spread of 
AIDS among Haitians, intravenous drug users and Africans, many of whom suffer 
from chronic malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Selenium levels in the diet could be a factor in the time it takes to develop 
full-blown AIDs. If you have a better selenium status, that could be a factor," 
said Taylor, who bases his hypothesis on research conducted through computer 
simulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the evidence we have for this, at this point, is totally theoretical. But 
it is pretty compelling theoretical evidence and it is consistent with 
pre-existing evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Selenium, which researchers believe has both anti-cancer and antiviral 
effects, is an antioxidant which helps maintain the function of immune cells. 
</P>
<P>
 The link between the nutrient and acquired immune deficiency syndrome has been 
known for some time. But researchers up to now have viewed selenium depletion 
among AIDS sufferers as a symptom of problems in absorbing nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
 Because selenium also can be toxic, however, researchers advise people to use 
supplements only after consulting their physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our work says that there may be a more direct link between the HIV virus and 
selenium than was previously suspected," said Taylor.

SCORES OF CONVICTIONS REVIEWED AS CHEMIST FACES PERJURY ACCUSATIONS; FORENSICS: 
FRED ZAIN'S EXPERT TESTIMONY AND LAB TESTS HELPED PUT SCORES OF RAPISTS AND 
MURDERERS BEHIND BARS. BUT COLLEGE TRANSCRIPT SHOWS HE FLUNKED SOME CHEMISTRY 
CLASSES AND BARELY PASSED OTHERS. HE IS ALSO ACCUSED OF EVIDENCE-TAMPERING.

<P>
 Fred Zain, a police chemist whose expert testimony and lab tests helped put 
scores of rapists and murderers behind bars in two states over 13 years, now 
finds himself in the dock. 
</P>
<P>
 Zain is charged with lying in court and tampering with evidence in his 
laboratories, compelling judges in West Virginia and Texas to release men sent 
to prison on the strength of blood and semen samples Zain verified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have no idea why he did what he did," said Jack Buckalew, a former 
superintendent of the West Virginia State Police. "The only possible reason I 
can speculate on is to enhance his status with prosecutors by saying what he 
thought they wanted him to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Zain, 43, surrendered on Aug. 4 in Hondo, Tex., to answer charges of 
aggravated perjury, evidence tampering and fabrication connected to the 1990 
rape conviction of Gilbert Alejandro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's no criminal intent," said attorney Sam Bayless. 
</P>
<P>
 Zain refused to talk to reporters and left Medina County Jail after posting 
$6,000 bond. Trial is scheduled for Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Zain worked as a serologist for the West Virginia State Police from 1980 to 
1989. He resigned to become chief of physical evidence for the medical examiner 
in Bexar County, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas has freed two men convicted on now-disproven blood tests done by Zain: 
Alejandro, who served four years of a 12-year sentence, and Jack W. Davis, 
convicted of murder in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis missed a death sentence by the vote of one juror and is suing Zain for 
$10 million. After Davis' conviction, Zain changed his testimony about blood at 
the scene of a teacher's mutilation-murder, acknowledging the blood came from 
the victim rather than Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Zain's work or testimony figures in hundreds of other Texas cases, and 
authorities say they will review each one. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Virginia, Zain is accused of lying about his credentials and about 
performing specific lab tests in a 1991 double-murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-one convictions, all but five of them for murder or rape, were granted 
reviews because of Zain's "long history of falsifying evidence in criminal 
prosecutions," according to a report presented to the West Virginia Supreme 
Court last year. Lower courts have rejected 25 appeals, but one man was freed 
and at least three, including a father and son convicted in a rape, have been 
granted retrials because of Zain's allegedly false testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicions about Zain's work first surfaced publicly in 1992, when tests he 
had performed five years earlier figured prominently in the dismissal of two 
rape convictions against Glen Dale Woodall, a Huntington cemetery worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Woodall's innocence was chiefly confirmed through DNA semen tests 
that were not allowed at his 1987 trial, a subsequent check of non-DNA trial 
evidence showed a strong probability that he was convicted on tainted 
information from Zain, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zain had testified, for example, that it was "highly unlikely" a hair found in 
one rape victim's borrowed car could have come from any source but Woodall's 
blond beard. But a written report from March, 1987, three months before the 
trial, shows Zain initially described the sample as a pubic hair and never 
bothered to compare it to hair from the man who owned the car. 
</P>
<P>
 When freed, Woodall had served five years of a sentence of two life terms plus 
335 years. The state paid him $1 million in compensation, the maximum allowed 
by law. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel appointed by the state Supreme Court found that Zain, at numerous 
trials, fabricated or altered evidence and lied about academic qualifications 
under oath. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's report said Zain was routinely "overstating the strength of 
results, overstating the frequency of genetic matches . . . reporting 
inconclusive results as conclusive, repeatedly altering laboratory records . . 
. implying a match with a suspect when testing supported only a match with the 
victim, and reporting scientifically impossible or improbable results." 
</P>
<P>
 It also said Zain's supervisors may have "ignored or concealed complaints" 
about his laboratory work. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Zain had moved to San Antonio, West Virginia prosecutors continued 
to seek him out to analyze evidence because his results were more favorable 
than those obtained by his successors, according to George Castelle, a 
Charleston public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Zain left, the lab sometimes couldn't make any determinations, or the 
defendant would come within 40% of the population, whereas Zain always gave 
better probabilities because he faked evidence," Castelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the criticism of his role in the Woodall case, Zain was fired from the 
Texas job in July, 1993, and left the state. A source involved in the Zain 
investigation says the chemist was dismissed for losing evidence; Bexar County 
Medical Examiner Vincent DiMaio failed to return multiple phone calls from the 
Associated Press seeking clarification of the firing. 
</P>
<P>
 In neither state, however, were officials zealous about checking Zain's 
background or, once alerted to possible blunders, in investigating their 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Zain graduated from West Virginia State College with a C average. His 
transcript shows he flunked some chemistry classes and barely passed others. In 
court, Zain often testified he majored in biology and minored in chemistry; the 
transcript shows only the biology major. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Blake, then-director of the state police's Criminal Identification 
Bureau, said he never questioned Zain's academic background when recommending 
him for the state police job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did neighborhood and criminal background checks," said Blake, who now heads 
the criminology department at Zain's alma mater. "Any interviewing for his 
academic qualifications was done by the people who headed the lab." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Barber, lab chief at the time, said he felt no need to check Zain's 
credentials because Zain had a "lab background" as a chemist with the state 
Department of Natural Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, two fellow lab workers told superiors they had seen Zain record 
results from blank test plates. The court panel said state police investigators 
looked into the allegations and dismissed them as an office squabble. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't like Zain, and Zain didn't like them," Blake said of that time. 
"But we never had any complaints from prosecutors, defense attorneys or 
investigators." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also cited an internal state police audit of August, 1992, 
indicating Zain had falsified test results or lied about performing certain 
tests as early as September, 1986. But when a special prosecutor appointed by 
the court to investigate Zain asked the police superintendent about the 
chemist, Buckalew told him there was "no need to take any further action." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed in early August, Buckalew said he was "satisfied" no one was 
wrongly jailed as a result of Zain's work.

PRESERVING A PIECE OF AFRICAN SAVANNA IN EASTERN OHIO GRASSLAND; ANIMALS: THE 
WILDS IS WHERE THE DEER, ANTELOPE AND OTHER ENDANGERED SPECIES PLAY. SOME HOPE 
IT WILL BECOME A PROTOTYPE FOR ZOOS NATIONWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four African gazelles, free to run on the nation's largest endangered wildlife 
preserve, clustered near a fence. 
</P>
<P>
 For these endangered animals born in zoos, it was only natural. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're used to being in captivity. They stay near the fence because that's 
where they're comfortable," said Mark Artzner, director of development of the 
Wilds, a 24-square-mile reclaimed strip mine in eastern Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "But gradually you'll see them getting more adventurous." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the gazelles do start exploring, they'll roam the preserve with rhinos, 
giraffes, zebras and camels. 
</P>
<P>
 The gazelles are among 105 endangered animals sent to the Wilds, about 70 
miles east of Columbus, from zoos across the country. The zoos are trying to 
save the animals from extinction. There are only 1,200 gazelles worldwide, and 
most of them are in zoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the animals at the Wilds are native to Africa or Asia. Some, such as 
the red wolf and trumpeter swan, come from North America. Hundreds of other 
animals native to Ohio also live on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The preserve, donated by American Electric Power Co., is primarily treeless, 
covered by knee-deep grass and dotted with lakes that provide drinking water 
for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look out here, it looks more like an African savanna than eastern 
Ohio," Artzner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilds, surrounded by farms and small towns, is in the early stages of 
development. Only about one-10th of the area is being used, but there are plans 
for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other comparable endangered wildlife preserve in the country is the 
Fossil Rim Wildlife Center, about 75 miles southwest of Dallas. About one-third 
the size of the Wilds, Fossil Rim covers 3,000 acres and has 1,100 endangered 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilds could become a prototype for zoos nationwide, said Mike Hutchins, 
director of conservation and science for the American Assn. of Zoological Parks 
and Aquariums. The Bethesda, Md.-based group represents local zoos and wildlife 
parks throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think you'll see more of these larger, isolated preserves rather than 
the traditional urban parks," Hutchins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the Wilds succeeds will depend on the amount of financial support it 
receives from state and corporate leaders, he said. The Wilds has an annual 
budget of $900,000, mainly composed of corporate donations and local and state 
government money. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the preserve to public tours also should help generate interest and 
money, Hutchins said. This summer the Wilds is open to tourists for the first 
time since animals began arriving three years ago. The operators expect about 
60,000 visitors through Labor Day. Through early July, the park was averaging 
about 5,000 visitors a week. 
</P>
<P>
 But attendance is not the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our focus is on education and research," Artzner said. "This isn't an 
amusement park. That's not what we're aiming for." 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife scientists at the preserve are trying to develop ways to breed the 
endangered animals. They are working on techniques to freeze embryos and 
perform artificial insemination in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the research done at the Wilds benefits zoos and other animal parks 
because zoo research is limited by space, money and expertise, said Evan 
Blummer, the Wilds' director of animal science and animal health. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mark Reef, resource director of the Washington-based National Wildlife 
Assn., said taking animals outside their natural environment changes their 
behavior and could affect the outcome of the research. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not convinced they're doing that much," said Reef, whose group represents 
state fish and game associations. 
</P>
<P>
 Blummer acknowledged that it is difficult to determine what effect it could 
have. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know next to nothing about some of these animals," he said. "But remember, 
most of these animals were born in captivity at zoos." 
</P>
<P>
 Educating the public is another mission of the Wilds. That's one reason why 
park guides drive visitors through the preserve in vans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to understand what's going on with the rhinos, giraffes and 
what they're looking at," Artzner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest challenge facing the Wilds staff is trying to strike a balance 
between curious visitors and maintaining a natural environment for the animals. 
Management has considered limiting the number of tours and requiring 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question is how we manage the human population out here," Artzner 
said. "We don't want to look out and see traffic jams on the preserve."

IS THIS OREGON? NO, IT'S HEAVEN, PASTOR SAYS; STATE DISAGREES; RELIGION: PAUL 
REVERE CLAIMS A FLOCK OF 200 AND EXEMPTION FROM WORLDLY LAWS, INCLUDING 
TAXATION. BUT OFFICIALS SAY UNLESS HE PAYS $10,000 IN OVERDUE LEVIES, HIS 
'KINGDOM' WILL BE CONFISCATED.

<P>
 For pastor Paul Revere, getting into Heaven is easy. It's getting out that's a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Revere drove his white car out of the 34-acre Kingdom of Heaven, 
he wound up in jail for displaying Heaven license plates and carrying a 
Heaven-issued driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials haven't heeded Revere's claims of celestial citizenship. Nor 
do they believe the forested estate Revere calls the Kingdom of Heaven embassy 
belongs to God and is thus exempt from county tax rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Heaven owes more than $10,000 in property taxes, and the county plans to 
foreclose. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kingdom of Heaven is not of this world," Revere said in response. "The 
county has declared war on the saints." 
</P>
<P>
 Revere, the slender, bearded leader of the Embassy of Heaven church -- and 
until 1985 known as state Department of Transportation employee Craig Douglas 
Fleshman -- says it is impossible to serve both God and the state. He and his 
followers have renounced their worldly identities and function solely as 
citizens of Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Revere said his flock numbers 200, but only five currently reside in Heaven: 
Paul and his wife, Rachel, their daughters, Brooke, 14, and Skye, 11, and a 
scholar simply named Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
 The road to Heaven is full of potholes and dust, but the paradisaical plot is 
lush with trees, wild berries and a garden. The Revere family and their pet cat 
live in a spacious wood cabin with a deck overlooking a stream. A small 
hydroelectric plant provides Heaven with light. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical day features Revere preaching on various topics, Abraham working on 
his own translation of the Bible, and Rachel, Brooke and Skye baking bread and 
carrying out clerical duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are an earthly kingdom," Revere said. "Jesus has established his 
government on Earth, just as it is in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 Verily, he said, there are no taxes in Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus did not pay taxes," he said. "My rule is simple: Love God, love 
neighbor. I don't need 10 books of Oregon statutes to tell me how to live." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marion County tax collectors say that if the taxes aren't paid during the 
two-year redemption period, Heaven will be placed on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Stonecipher, the county's assistant legal counsel, said that each time a 
notice is sent to the embassy, "the note comes back asking God to bless us and 
informing us that the embassy is not part of Oregon and they do not owe taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Revere said he intends to remain steadfast in his claim that the state has no 
authority over God's property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather lose my body," he said, "than my soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Twice under arrest this year, Revere allowed his body to erode with hunger 
fasts. He refused every order by police officers, impassively stating that the 
state had no authority over him. 
</P>
<P>
 Revere's speech, sprinkled with admonitions and blessings and a "saith" here 
and there, offers only harsh words for worldly governments. In short, the state 
is the Antichrist, and the courts are the Halls of Satan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court is Satan's religion carried on by the state," Revere said. "There 
is a reason why everyone has an attorney, why the judge wears a black robe. It 
is part of their satanic worship." 
</P>
<P>
 For Revere, to participate in a worldly government is blasphemy. And that is 
the one charge worthy of expulsion from Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Revere asks his followers to do what he has done: Become "unyoked" from the 
governments of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Throw away state-issued driver's licenses and Social Security cards, close 
bank accounts, give up voting, leave public schools, and tear up library cards. 
Reject the worldly bonds of car insurance and vehicle registration. 
</P>
<P>
 For modest prices, Kingdom citizens can carry Heaven documents, kindly issued 
by Revere from the embassy in Sublimity, about 20 miles southeast of the seat 
of state power in Salem. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they are invalid, Revere has issued between 200 and 300 license plates 
for use in the United States and Mexico. Recently, he began printing passports, 
complete with embossed gold lettering and a watermark from Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a bureaucrat for Jesus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currency may be next, although Revere said, "I don't believe handling a 
Federal Reserve note is condemnation." He said the group prefers to use gold 
and silver, and also relies on generous gifts, ranging from bags of wheat to 
computer systems, from area Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 Revere said Heaven's income from cash sales of license plates, documents and 
brochures is God's business and no one else's. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership lists are closed as well, and Heaven citizens are impossible to 
track except by their former worldly identities, which are secret. Revere 
refused even to utter his former name or that of his wife, Rachel, who once was 
called Marilyn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Revere considers the Kingdom a sovereign nation. He established the outpost in 
1987 to serve citizens living in what he calls foreign lands such as Oregon, 
Utah and Texas. He hopes to have "embassies" in every foreign state someday. 
</P>
<P>
 Heaven citizens are accountable only to God, Revere said, and he considers 
"arbitrary regulation" such as speed limits to be no more than a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 At least a dozen Heaven drivers have been caught speeding in the United 
States, then carted off to jail for their other-worldly documentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Revere said he expects to be arrested again himself for not showing up for his 
next court date this month, but he doesn't seem concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because they pretend that we are not God's people but residents of the 
state of Oregon," he said, "doesn't change anything."

SHEEP REDUCE USE OF HERBICIDES IN FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAL SPENCER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some conservationists call sheep "desert maggots" for their destructive effect 
on rangeland. But the sheep grazing in the ponderosa and fir forest near here 
are as environmentally correct as recycled paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Forestry scientists monitoring the 2,200 animals foraging in the shadow of Mt. 
Adams say they are an old-fashioned alternative to chemical herbicides, since 
they chomp on underbrush that slows forest growth and sustains tree-killing 
gophers. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheep graze in timberlands owned by the state Department of Natural 
Resources and by Champion International Corp. The herd, owned by rancher Robert 
Shannon, are trucked to the range in May and hauled back to Shannon's spread in 
Ellensburg in early fall. 
</P>
<P>
 No one involved in the nearly 3-year-old experiment pretends that sheep are a 
major alternative to herbicides or heavy equipment in the constant battle to 
remove brush and fight gophers, which kill young trees by eating their roots. 
</P>
<P>
 But, of any brush-control strategy in young industrial forests, plain old 
sheep can be the easiest on the land and should be used when possible, 
scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is environmentally sound. It doesn't tear up the land, but it also works 
and that's the best part," said state Lands Commissioner Jennifer Belcher. 
"We're looking at doing this in several areas."  
</P>
<P>
 So is forest-products giant Champion International, which joined with the 
state to open a 2,000-acre summer range on adjoining state and Champion land in 
Klickitat County about 50 miles southwest of Yakima. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finding that in young forests, this approach gives us a golden 
opportunity to double the growth rate of trees in an environmentally sound 
way," said Wayne Vinyard, forester and contract administrator for Champion's 
Klickitat operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Properly applied, herbicides are environmentally sound and more cost-effective 
than sheep because they control brush much more quickly, Vinyard said. But 
given public antipathy toward herbicides, use of sheep can make the most 
political sense, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinyard stopped to wipe his brow and survey the peaceful sight before him. 
Sheep, their bells clanking, churned up brown dust as they grazed their way up 
the hillside of young trees and headed for the shade of the forest above. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepherd John Garcia emerged from the dust behind the sheep, a rifle slung 
across his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been tough up here for the (sheep) owner," Vinyard said. Two years 
before, a mountain lion killed nearly a dozen sheep, and there have been other 
losses to predators and rustling, he said.

 Shannon, the rancher, pays no fees to graze his sheep, but that savings is 
offset by losses caused by the animals' gaining weight more slowly, according 
to Louie Halloin, natural resources silvaculturist who oversees the grazing 
program for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The herd's weight gain is slowed because the grazing is tightly controlled to 
prevent overgrazing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grazing restrictions include limits on how close sheep can get to riparian 
zones that buffer creeks and streams, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The late environmental writer Edward Abbey, among others, referred to sheep as 
"desert maggots" responsible for major overgrazing of Western rangelands. 
</P>
<P>
 Halloin, whose career has been devoted to creating environmentally sound 
forestry, said overgrazing is the fault of bad management, not the sheep. 
</P>
<P>
 "All parties in this operation work closely together to make it work," he 
said. That means balancing the needs of the sheep with those of the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we're doing that here," Halloin said.

DEATH WAITS AS SMOKE JUMPERS PLAY WITH FIRE; THE WEST: THEY CHEAT DEATH ONE 
JUMP AT A TIME. EACH SUMMER, THEY PARACHUTE INTO DOZENS OF LIGHTNING-SPARKED 
BLAZES IN OTHERWISE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS.

<P>
 Thinking back to July 6, as Mike Tupper often does these days, the forest fire 
looked routine, not like a hellish mass killer. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Tupper sent smoke jumpers parachuting from a plane to the fire that 
July day near Glenwood Springs, Colo., two would never return. The two, and a 
third jumper from another plane, were among 14 firefighters who died when 
overrun by flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Tupper hangs his head, his shoulder-length hair falling over an earring, his 
flashing smile and swashbuckling gait both gone. Even now, the 35-year-old 
smoke jumper from Fairbanks, Alaska, feels responsible, but knows he's not. 
</P>
<P>
 His job as spotter that day was to pick a safe parachute-landing site. He did. 
The jumpers did not die until evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Tupper recalls the other jumpers' faces when they heard of the deaths. "You 
can tell when somebody is about to cry," he said during a recent rotation 
through the regional base in Redding, 200 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But none admit to crying, at least publicly. These are members of an elite 
federal smoke-jumper corps, each some mix of paratrooper, lumberjack, pioneer 
and adventurer. They describe themselves as boisterous, obnoxious, loud and 
funny, for starters. 
</P>
<P>
 They say their off-duty antics, often tied to drinking, are legendary with 
locals. Bars and restaurants name sandwiches after them and put memorabilia up 
on walls. Jumpers know each others' families. They attend each others' weddings 
and funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 During quiet, private moments -- and never in front of one another -- they 
admit to thoughts that they cheat death one jump at a time, one fire at a time. 
Each summer, they parachute into dozens of lightning-sparked blazes in 
otherwise inaccessible mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a smoke jumper, you need a lot of luck," Tupper said. 
</P>
<P>
 He once was dragged behind a plane in snarled parachute lines, banging against 
the fuselage before dropping to a successful landing. "Two days later, it came 
to me: 'God, I could have died,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jumpers killed recently in Colorado were the first to die by fire since a 
dozen perished in the 1949 Mann Gulch blaze in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 After a jump, the firefighters fell trees, chop brush and scrape grass with 
hand tools and muscle for hours, or days. After encircling and quelling each 
blaze, they sometimes hike out many miles with hundred-pound packs bearing 
equipment that was dropped to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The main lure is excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an admitted Adrenalin junkie," said Ken Perkins, a 48-year-old veteran 
jumper who is recovering from shoulder, arm, neck and back injuries from a 1993 
training jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "People aren't doing it for the big bucks at all," said Walt Smith, the 
47-year-old Redding base manager, a 25-year jumper from Missoula, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay starts at $9 an hour for the standard daytime shifts, five days a 
week. It goes up at fires with overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 There are just 387 jumpers in the nation, and Dana Lucas, a first-year jumper, 
is one of only about 10 women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing what's unexpected for a woman," said Lucas, 24, of Richmond, Va. 
"When I'm keeping up with the guys, I also feel I'm working harder. I feel 
proud." 
</P>
<P>
 Most jumpers are not year-round federal workers. Some are students and 
teachers on break during fire season. Others leave jobs such as insurance agent 
and chiropractor. Some use jump money to finance winter activities, ranging 
from rock climbing in Mexico to selling art in Redding. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Redding base, hundreds of people applied this season for only nine 
openings. Most of the successful applicants were already firefighters with 
other outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 The jumpers shuffle between the nine U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land 
Management regional jumper bases throughout the West. When fires hit, bosses 
decide where to dispatch jumpers and how many to send. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke jumpers are federally certified to fell huge trees. They also become 
expert at climbing into and out of them. They overhaul their chain saws 
themselves, and hone shovels and other hand tools to a razor edge. They even 
have invented some of their hand tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The jumpers have designed suits, made partly of the same material that goes 
into bulletproof vests, to protect them when they accidentally parachute into 
trees. They sew the suits and just about everything else -- their packs, tool 
harnesses, parachutes. One jumper made his wife a dress in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 Parachutes, and secondary reserve parachutes, are crucial parts of a jumper's 
gear, and the jumpers' methods must meet Federal Aviation Administration 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Service jumpers use round parachutes and must bail out of planes at 
1,500 feet above the ground. Bureau of Land Management jumpers use rectangular 
parachutes and have to leave the plane at 3,000 feet. A mixed crew has to be 
dropped at two different altitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both types of parachutes can be steered by pulling the shroud lines, and 
jumpers practice parachuting in various ways, including use of a computer 
simulator. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parachutes are used to drop supplies to the firefighters immediately 
after they have jumped. Cardboard cargo boxes contain everything from paper 
sleeping bags to food. The menu ranges from freeze-dried mocha mousse pie to 
canned cabbage rolls with sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge of landing cargo on target is the best part of the job to pilot 
Andy Johnston, 50, of Big Fork, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like shooting pool," said Johnston, who flies a Spanish-built military 
cargo plane that he has dubbed "a Winnebago with wings." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston and the jumpers never stray far from that Winnebago when on duty. If 
the call comes, they have to be airborne in 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But when there are no fires, jumpers must wait, do chores and work out. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Boyd Burtch, a 30-year-old jumper from Missoula, Mont., "It's not the 
fires that are hard. It's the waiting."

NEVADANS TOPS IN LIVING IT UP, AND MEDICAL BILLS SHOW IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GARDNER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nevadans' obsession with smoking, drinking and other unhealthy behavior is 
showing no improvement, a survey shows. And what's more distressing, the 
elderly in this graying state are particularly threatened by their unhealthy 
lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so bad that we can't go much higher," said Judy Calder, director of the 
Center for Applied Research at the University of Nevada, Reno. "We are the only 
state that isn't improving." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 results released recently by Calder and Martin Atherton, the state's 
chief health statistician, ranked Nevada No. 1 both in the percentage of its 
population that smokes and in the percentage that drinks chronically. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevadans also were at or near the top in the percentage of people who drink 
and drive and of motorists who don't wear seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because our rates are so high, statistically, you'd expect a drop. We're not 
dropping," Calder said. "It was a surprise on our part that the rates didn't go 
lower." 
</P>
<P>
 "The train's going in the wrong direction," Atherton agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, known as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, measured 
the general mental and physical health of 1,800 randomly selected adults living 
in Nevada. The survey was first taken in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Identical surveys are conducted annually in all states in collaboration with 
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which compiles the 
national data. Many states, however, never issue their results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevada is trying to take the lead in releasing these data," Calder said. "We 
feel we need to promote public information and to get these data to the 
policy-makers, including legislators. We feel that decision-makers need to have 
this information." 
</P>
<P>
 The findings show that 30% of all Nevada adults smoke, while 10% of all men 
and 2% of all women average two alcoholic drinks or more a day. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most shocking findings, Calder said, was that 23% of respondents 
aged 65-74 said they were ill 15 days or more during the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our elderly population, at least in Nevada, is really in bad shape," she 
said. "Twenty-three percent of them spent half a month unable to care for 
themselves. We were so shocked when we saw those results. We did not expect 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Atherton said that with 18% to 20% of all Nevadans falling in the older 
category, "it's a big chunk of people. Nevada's senior population appears to be 
at a disproportionate health risk based on these 'quality of life' indicators." 
</P>
<P>
 Calder said the statistics are particularly upsetting since 14% of the people 
in the state between the ages of 55 and 64 have no health insurance. That 
number drops to a fraction for people 65 and over because they become eligible 
for Medicare and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey showed that the largest percentages of uninsured people -- 36% -- 
are in the 18-24 age bracket. Forty-four percent of those who earn less than 
$10,000 have no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the low income, less educated who tend to be more at risk," Calder said. 
"We're trying to change behavior or modify behavior among a group that's tough 
to reach. How do we take care of these people? 
</P>
<P>
 "As the national health care debate proceeds, we believe the issue of health 
care coverage is important for Nevada -- especially given the state's unusually 
high percentage of people at risk," Calder said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also reported that 7.2% of all men and 1.6% of all women said they 
had driven under the influence at least once in the past month. A quarter of 
all men and 15.8% of all women admitted that they sometimes, seldom or never 
wore seat belts.

THE SHULER PLAN; TENNESSEE STANDOUT SEEN EXTENDING REDSKINS' ROYAL LINE AT 
QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KNISLEY, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The kid drops back while Henry Ellard and Desmond Howard streak downfield. The 
receivers screech-stop 20 yards from the line of scrimmage and come back toward 
the play. One of them, the one in single coverage, is open, the buttonhook 
enough to spring him from the cornerback before the free safety can get there. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad. The quarterback isn't looking at his wideouts. His reads on this play 
don't extend beyond tight end Ethan Horton's curl pattern and running back 
Ricky Ervins' crossing route. Ervins makes the safe catch and picks up maybe 
six yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard is open downfield for at least 15, if the quarterback looks. But Ellard 
isn't in "The Plan" on this play. The patterns look the same as they did in 
Norv Turner's playbook last season in Dallas when Troy Aikman regularly hit 
Michael Irvin or Alvin Harper on the buttonhook. Only now the plan has the 
quarterback reading the routes of maybe only half of his available receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that could happen," says Ellard, the 12-year wide receiver who left the 
Los Angeles Rams last spring to sign a free-agent contract with the Washington 
Redskins. "There's always that chance. We'll just have to stay basic for a 
while, but that's all part of the game. You have to be patient with that." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Plan," if it works the way Turner designs it as the new coach in 
Washington, will sacrifice a few yards here and there for the sake of a greater 
good: the proper care and feeding of Heath Shuler, first-round draft choice and 
next in the Redskins' royal Sammy Baugh-Sonny Jurgensen-Billy Kilmer-Joe 
Theismann-Doug Williams-Mark Rypien line of quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler, who sometime soon will become the first rookie to start a game at 
quarterback for Washington (excluding the strike team in 1987) since Norm Snead 
in 1961, is the heir to that legacy. Or error to it, depending on how well 
Turner's plan works. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's already got a pretty good overview of what we do," says Turner, who 
comes to the Redskins from consecutive Super Bowl victories as the Cowboys' 
offensive coordinator. "Now, we're going to get into the details and see how 
many things between now and when we get to that first game that he can handle 
both verbally and mentally. And he has to not only be able to handle them; he 
has to get real good at them. If he's just OK at a lot of things, we've got 
real problems. But if he can get real good at some specific things, then we can 
gear a game plan towards him." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to Shulerize the Redskins is threefold: prepare, simplify and 
protect. The preparation started right after Turner and Washington General 
Manager Charley Casserly made Shuler the third pick in the first round, 
beginning with a minicamp in late April in which the coaching staff threw the 
playbook at him. The simplification comes in the form of reads on plays, such 
as the one addressed above, in which Shuler's options are minimized. And the 
protection comes from an offensive line that, if healthy, ought to give Shuler 
more time to make decisions with the ball than most rookie quarterbacks enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner thinks it can be done, even if the 'Skins don't exactly have history on 
their side. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have tried to turn a rookie quarterback into an overnight sensation in 
the National Football League; few have succeeded, especially in recent years. 
The list of successes pretty much starts and ends with Don Shula and Dan Marino 
in 1983, when Marino started nine games for Shula's Miami Dolphins and won 
seven of them, recording 20 touchdown passes, six interceptions and a 96.0 
passer rating. But Marino was the 27th player chosen in the first round in '83. 
He joined a team that already was good enough to have played in the Super Bowl 
the previous January. 
</P>
<P>
 The other rookie quarterbacks who have started in the last 15 years or so 
didn't have that kind of support when they entered the league. Most of them, 
like Shuler coming to a team that was 4-12 in '93, were high draft choices on 
bad teams. Some had downright dreadful numbers as rookies, such as Randall 
Cunningham's efficiency rating of 29.8 in four starts (1-3) as a rookie with 
the Philadelphia Eagles and Troy Aikman's 0-11 record as a starter in the 
Dallas Cowboys' 1-15 season of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the league's top two draft picks -- the New England Patriots' Drew 
Bledsoe and the Seattle Seahawks' Rick Mirer -- started for their new teams and 
showed . . . well, promise at best. Mirer started all 16 of the Seahawks' 
games, went 6-10, passed for 2,833 yards at a 56.4% completion rate and was 
heavier on the interceptions (17) than the TDs (12). Bledsoe was 5-7 in his 12 
starts, completed only 49.9% of his passes for 2,494 yards and threw as many 
touchdown passes (15) as interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Parcells and Tom Flores no doubt had training-camp plans for the 
immediate integration of their rookies into the league, too, although Parcells 
says now that Bledsoe started last year only because he was the least of the 
quarterbacking evils on the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he was ready to start the season," Parcells says. "There was no 
question he wasn't ready. We just didn't have anybody that was better who was 
more ready. We just went with him knowing we were going to have to live with a 
lot of bad plays and a lot of bad decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Turner isn't daunted by the history, especially the Patriots' history. 
Doesn't apply to the Redskins, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard Parcells said they wouldn't have played Bledsoe if they had another 
guy," Turner says. "Well, we've got another guy. John Friesz is capable of 
starting. He's won games in this league. He's having an outstanding training 
camp, so some of the pressure comes off Heath. If Heath is ready to do some 
things, we'll use him. If he isn't ready, John is quite capable of playing. I'm 
glad Parcells made that comment. That adds to my rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 But no 'Skins fan worth his hog-snout is going to stomach prolonged exposure 
to John Friesz, if the third pick of the draft is healthy and available and 
visible on the sideline. And Turner knows it, which is one of the reasons he 
has been talking since draft day about making Shuler the starter. The Redskins, 
aware they could draft Fresno State's Trent Dilfer if Shuler were picked 
earlier, signed Friesz away from the San Diego Chargers in April to occupy the 
blink-of-an-eye time slot between the end of their rookie's college career and 
his first snap as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Overblown demands from local fans are one of the problems every highly drafted 
quarterback faces, and Shuler shouldn't be exempted in Washington. Even the 
best of them experience some difficulty with the pressure of their potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the first things you can't do is try to live up to the expectations," 
says John Elway, whose rookie season in 1983 was less than memorable at 4-6 as 
the Denver Broncos' starter with a 47.5% completion rate and twice as many 
interceptions (14) as touchdowns (7). "People don't realize how difficult the 
transition is. Heath, coming into a new system, is going to have a hard enough 
time just getting the offense to where he feels comfortable with it, knowing 
the quick decisions and reading the different defenses and coverages he's going 
to be seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he has a great year, but I'm sure that people are going to always 
expect him to do a little bit more than he does because he was a high draft 
pick. People are expecting him to be the franchise, but it always takes two, 
three, four years before you can really feel comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the NFL, Heath. Here's hoping Norv's plan works for you, buddy. 
Here's hoping all those extra hours of cramming during the summer and in 
training camp give you a better chance than those other rookie starters had. 
Here's hoping all your rookie optimism isn't undermined by the realities of the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't consider the Redskins a bad team," Shuler says. "I mean, it wasn't 
but a few years ago that they won the Super Bowl. I think I'm real fortunate, 
real lucky, to come to such a team. Washington has a great tradition. This is a 
good situation, especially with Coach Turner being here and the coaching staff 
he's put together. I know we'll be better than we were last year." 
</P>
<P>
 If anybody other than Don Shula can pull this off, Turner can. In his first 
season with the Cowboys, he helped Aikman take the quantum leap from mediocrity 
to superstardom, and he did it with a plan not unlike his formula for Shuler. 
Even though Aikman had been playing for a couple of years, Turner kept the 
offense basic for him in their first season together. The difference was 
noticeable, immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 In Aikman's first two years in the league (1989-90) -- without Turner -- he 
completed 55.1% of his passes with 20 touchdowns and 36 interceptions. In the 
last three seasons -- with Turner -- Aikman has 49 touchdown passes and 30 
interceptions and he has completed 69% of his passes. The effect on his 
efficiency rating is remarkable: from 62.0 in the two years B.T. (Before 
Turner) to 91.7 in the last three. Aikman was the Super Bowl MVP after the 1992 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Aikman would have improved that much in his third season, anyway. Most 
quarterbacks say it takes about that long to feel comfortable in the NFL. But 
Aikman doesn't downplay his former offensive coordinator's influence. 
</P>
<P>
 His experience in Dallas is what Shuler can expect in Washington. "Norv came 
in and kind of just held to the philosophy that we may not do all that much, 
but we're going to disguise it with a lot of formations and a lot of motioning, 
and we're going to get good at those plays we do well," Aikman says. "Then it 
was just a matter of not trying to outsmart anybody. We just tried to 
outexecute them. That was really our philosophy during that first year Norv was 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "As each year went on, we were able to expand. Obviously, since last season 
was our third year together, we were doing a lot of different things by then. 
We were putting in new things that Norv had not used at all in previous years. 
We were just kind of drawing on the board during the games, finding things we 
thought would work. Then we'd just put them in." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Shuler showed up for his first minicamp in Washington, Turner didn't 
want him thinking the pro game was so basic. Rather than ease him into the 
offense, as some coaches might do for a rookie, he gave Shuler everything in 
the book and asked him to absorb it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the shock-treatment part of the plan. "I almost wanted to overwhelm him 
so he understood that he had a lot to do," Turner says. "Hell, we could've been 
calling the plays for him in the huddle in practices, and the truth is, we 
could get things done that way. But I wanted him to start experiencing the 
physical things we were going to ask him to do, too. And I wanted him to get as 
relaxed as he could in the atmosphere of being around the guys. By the first 
part of July, when we started working, he was very impressive. He put a lot of 
time in (before training camp), and he's throwing the ball with a better 
understanding of the style of routes we want." 
</P>
<P>
 As the summer progressed, though, Turner streamlined Shuler's exposure to the 
big picture of the offense. The coach cut back on the quarterback's reads, gave 
him fewer "hot" receivers (whose routes change in the course of a play, 
according to the coverage) to watch, reduced the number of audibles he might 
otherwise call -- all designed to minimize the number of decisions Shuler will 
need to make in the heat of action. 
</P>
<P>
 Once camp opened, the plan included a detailed, day-by-day, force-feeding 
schedule of the food groups vital to good health as a starting quarterback. A 
little taste of the 40-second clock on Monday, some blitz appetizers on 
Tuesday, a side dish of two-deep zone on Wednesday. If this is Saturday, we 
must be dining on exhibition-game action. Turner had it all on Shuler's menu -- 
what he wanted him to digest, and when he wanted him to digest it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just started practicing, and the whole offense is already in," Shuler 
says. "Obviously, it's going to clutter your mind a little. But I think we've 
done a really good job. Any time you go from one offense to another, it's going 
to be complicated. At Tennessee, we had a large offense, probably one of the 
most complicated offenses in college football. It was a lot. And when I went in 
there, it was the exact same thing. They threw the book at me then. So when I 
came here, I expected that. They have a plan for everything. The plan is to get 
to know the offense and do whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler's 13-day holdout from camp before he signed an eight-year, $19.25 
million contract last week threw the plan a little out of kilter, but the 
schedule should be disrupted only temporarily. When he finally reported to 
Carlisle, Pa., Aug. 3, Shuler still had plenty of time. If he doesn't start 
against Mirer and the Seahawks Sept. 4, it won't be long after.

U.S. SHOULD HAVE CUT DOWN DEFENSE SPENDING YEARS AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only Michael Boskin ("Clinton's Defense Cuts: Risky for the Nation, Bad for 
California," Aug. 14), an economist who worked in George Bush's White House and 
who helped create the country's worst post-World War II recession, could 
possibly describe tiny world-away Bosnia as a "ruthless aggressor" and use such 
as a rationale for America spending more on the military. That's Canada to the 
north, not Bosnia.Even the NRA doesn't use Bosnia as an excuse for arming. 
</P>
<P>
 When will Mr. Boskin realize that California cannot and should not rely on 
defense to bolster its economy? We should have begun the weaning process years 
and years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 America has spent trillions on "defense" over the decades. Isn't it about time 
we realize that we have other tax dollar priorities that need tending to for a 
change, like education, health, infrastructure?

WOMEN NEED BUSINESS, NOT KITCHEN, TOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After attending the women's Visions expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center 
(Jane Applegate's Small Business column, Aug. 2), the plain fact is that most 
women have progressed no further than the new, advanced mop that stole the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the booths were unrelated to any possible new vision for women. There 
was an obvious lack of business and educational companies' participating in 
demonstrating the tools of the present and future. 
</P>
<P>
 Visions is put on in six states. L.A. is one city in desperate need of woman 
retraining. Women need more than hair spray products if they are going to 
achieve their visions.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: EVEN GENIUSES AREN'T GOOD AT THIS MARRIAGE THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN, Robin Abcarian's column is published Wednesdays and Sundays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marriage, I have always suspected, is harder than physics. 
</P>
<P>
 And now there is proof. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes in the form of Albert Einstein's love letters, written around the 
turn of the century to the fellow physics student who would become his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 They are printed in the scientific journal "Physics Today" (which, believe me, 
has never been found in my bathroom) in a two-part story on Einstein's 
ultimately doomed first marriage. The stories are excerpts from Harvard 
professor Gerald Holton's book, "Einstein, History and Other Passions," to be 
released in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The billets-doux are poignant in their torrid domesticity, devotion and 
diminutive. Often they segue into descriptions of Einstein's groundbreaking 
ideas about physics. 
</P>
<P>
 Mileva is Albert's "beloved witch," "radiant little darling" and "dear 
kitten." 
</P>
<P>
 "If only you were again with me for a while!" a 21-year-old Albert writes to a 
24-year-old Mileva in August, 1900. "We understand so well each other's dark 
souls, and also drinking coffee & eating sausages, etc. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sets of parents opposed the match, which, as we all know from reading 
that other genius, Shakespeare, only served to cement the bond. 
</P>
<P>
 No offense to all the hot-blooded physicists who are pausing long enough in 
the search for a unified field theory to read the newspaper today, but does not 
the idea of Albert Einstein as a passionate, young, parents-defying lover fire 
up a smile? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic failure beset Einstein from his earliest adulthood. Unknown to 
scholars until Einstein's descendants donated the letters to his archives in 
1986, Albert and Mileva, who had two sons together, also had a daughter. 
Lieserl was born in secret a year before they married. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be students as long as we live," wrote Albert in 1901. "And we won't 
give a damn about the world. . . . The only problem that still needs to be 
solved is the question of how we can take our Lieserl to us, I don't want us to 
have to give her up. Ask your Papa, he's an experienced man. . . . She 
shouldn't be stuffed with cow's milk, because it might make her stupid. I 
believe yours would be more nourishing; what do you think? I have had another 
rather obvious but important scientific idea about molecular forces." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a reference in a 1903 letter to the child suffering scarlet fever, 
but according to Holton, no ones know if she survived. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1905, Einstein would publish "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies," in 
which he introduced his famous theory of relativity. And as his star rose, his 
marriage sunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt," Holton writes, "that the birth of Lieserl took a heavy 
toll on Mileva. More and more after these secret events she tended to brood. 
Perhaps she was blaming herself for the decision to give up her daughter, or 
she blamed Albert for acquiescing in it or possibly even for urging it upon 
her. We simply don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1909, Mileva described herself in a letter to a friend as "very starved for 
love." 
</P>
<P>
 "You see," wrote the woman who was once Einstein's radiant little darling, 
"with such fame not much time remains for his wife. . . . The pearls are given 
to the one, the other gets just the shell." 
</P>
<P>
 Mileva divorced Albert in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The elusive formula for happiness must involve a delicate balance of our two 
primary spheres, work and love. Is it possible to maintain zeniths in both? Can 
you be a great scientist and a passionate husband and devoted father? 
</P>
<P>
 Or is that too much to expect of any frail mortal? 
</P>
<P>
 I have a friend who has always maintained that no matter how hard she tries, 
she has never experienced domestic bliss at the same time she has soared on the 
job -- or at least they have never coincided for very long. Life, she says, 
just can't be that perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went with Einstein, who gave us three branches of physics, won a 
Nobel prize and made possible countless advances in technology. Marriage just 
wasn't his discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Einstein conceded wistfully," Holton writes, "that he had failed rather 
ignominiously in two attempts." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe in public terms, domestic bliss doesn't rank up there with developing a 
grand unified theory. But if you're happily married, consider yourself a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if you're no Einstein? When it came to love, neither was he.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; A WOMAN'S PLACE; SHE'S AN INFLUENTIAL ATTORNEY, BUT YOU 
WON'T FIND HER ON COURT TV. INSTEAD, ABBY J. LEIBMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S 
LAW CENTER TRIES TO DO HER GENDER JUSTICE IN THE BACK ROOMS OF GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Say the words woman and lawyer , and the image of Leslie Abramson, the sharp 
and maternally tender Menendez defender, is instantly summoned. Or perhaps that 
of O.J. Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Say women's rights lawyer and it's Gloria Allred, master of sound bites and 
class-action suits. 
</P>
<P>
 But in less-watched circles, another name is synonymous with women's causes: 
Abby J. Leibman, a self-described "not yet an A-string player." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-founder and executive director of the California Women's Law Center, 
Leibman advocates reform on a panoply of women's issues, from child care to 
child custody, domestic violence to discrimination. Her field of battle is 
rarely the courtroom, but rather the hearing rooms, committee rooms and 
conference rooms where public policy is written. Her clients tend to be women 
in the generic: immigrant women, disabled women, battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case media frenzy is at a full boil when Leibman calls a news 
conference at her mid-Wilshire offices to announce the establishment of the 
Battered Truth hot line. Wearing a courtroom-blue dress and speaking at a fast 
clip without notes, she attacks the myths surrounding domestic violence: 
</P>
<P>
 "We've begun to hear comments in the public and repeated in the press about 
whether or not women ask for it. . . . We don't ask this when we have 
stranger-to-stranger violence," she says with disgust. "We don't ask (if) I am 
walking down the street, (whether) it is my fault somebody hits me over the 
head with a baseball bat. But if that someone happened to be my husband, then 
suddenly we begin to ask, 'Was I inviting this kind of behavior?' It is no more 
valid in this context than it is in any other felonious assault." 
</P>
<P>
 After the news conference ends, Leibman announces to the assembly of 
activists, reporters and photographers that she has work to do and retreats to 
her office, leaving the lint of informational details to her colleagues.  
</P>
<P>
 That determination to get where she's going quickly sometimes translates to 
brusqueness. Even her closest colleagues say so. And Leibman concedes: "I am 
impatient." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she is known for forging collaboration, not only within her immediate 
circle, but also among the scores of public officials, activists and lawyers 
whose interests intersect her own. Women's groups, community groups, civil 
rights organizations, anti-poverty alliances and even the occasional individual 
call upon the 5-year-old, five-person law center, seeking information, 
technical assistance -- justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her work is impacting a lot of women," says Katherine Spillar, national 
coordinator of Feminist Majority Foundation, which is working with the NAACP 
and the law center to achieve gender balance in the Los Angeles Police 
Department, among other reforms. "She's hard-working, result-oriented and no 
frills. 'Let's get this done and move on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the 37-year-old Leibman tells it, sitting in her windowless office 
decorated with diplomas and Georgia O'Keeffe's poppy poster, the idea for the 
nonprofit law center dawned over dinner at Stratton's Grill in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Leibman was running the Child Care Law Project at the 
public-interest law firm Public Counsel, where her work involved easing zoning 
restrictions on "family day care" to create more spaces for children. Across 
the table was Jenifer McKenna, then executive director of the Los Angeles 
Women's Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were commiserating, Leibman recalls, about the lack of a centralized 
place in Southern California to go for help with women's rights issues, such as 
the National Women's Law Center in Washington, D.C., or Equal Rights Advocates 
in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, we looked at each other and (I) said, 'Someone should really open a 
woman's law center here .' And we thought, 'if we don't do it, nobody will.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, a dozen or so women were gathered in Leibman's living room to 
brainstorm and to volunteer for such tasks as raising money and filing 
incorporation papers. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Leibman quit her job and opened a large one-room office in Santa 
Monica. "We partitioned (it) off so we could live," says former managing 
partner Sheila James Kuehl, an attorney who recently won the Democratic primary 
for the 41st Assembly District seat. "Abby had always wanted a private office 
where she could close the door." Soon, McKenna joined them. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the center, built on private donations, has a nearly $400,000 annual 
budget and receives funds from individuals, corporations, law firms and such 
charitable groups as the James Irvine and Ford foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 It works the way Leibman, who draws a salary of about $65,000, envisioned it 
-- as a shepherd of big issues. "We wanted to look much more comprehensively at 
women's civil rights," she says, "the notion being that the issues all related 
to one another, and it's difficult to pull one away from the other."  
</P>
<P>
 At the core, she says, is "the feminization of poverty": Without decent child 
care, a woman can't work or go to school. Without access to training or 
education, she can't get a good job. Without a good job or other economic means 
of escape, she might stay in an abusive relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Leibman and her colleagues "use traditional legal skills in very 
non-traditional ways" to help such women. In many cases, that means working to 
change laws -- "to stop the problem before it is created," Leibman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a very effective lobbyist," says Wendy Grueul, a former City Hall 
staffer who worked with Leibman on Los Angeles' family day-care ordinance. 
"When you first meet Abby, you wouldn't necessarily think she'll knock your 
socks off, but she will."  
</P>
<P>
 "She has a precision mind," says Pat Towner, executive director of the 
California Commission on the Status of Women. "(It's) a missile on target." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How did this Valley girl from an "upper-middle-class, white, privileged" 
background become what she describes as a "raging feminist"? 
</P>
<P>
 She grew up in a large corner house in then-bucolic Chatsworth, the eldest 
daughter, along with a twin, of Joan and Michael Leibman. Her mother was a 
former chairwoman of the English department at Walter Reed Junior High School 
in North Hollywood. Her father, an aeronautics engineer, worked on 
guidance-and-control systems for lunar landings and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Abby's twin, Nina Leibman Donney, a college teacher of film and 
communications, believes it was she who set a feminist example by using Ms. , 
and not saying girl , while at Chatsworth High in the '70s . "Quite likely," 
Abby agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Leibman sisters -- a third, Marjorie Shaw, serves in the Peace Corps 
in Senegal -- point to their working mother and grandmothers, one of whom 
taught education at Brooklyn College and marched for the women's right to vote, 
as strong role models. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the first political names I ever heard was (Senate candidate) Helen 
Gahagan Douglas," Abby says. "My mother said to me, 'I don't care what you 
girls ever do, don't ever forget her name. This is a wonderful woman, and 
Richard Nixon smeared her.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One unhappy childhood experience may have fueled what Joan Leibman describes 
as her daughter's "passion for justice." When she became active in the Jewish 
Federation Council in the early '80s, Leibman remembers being asked to describe 
her worst experience as a Jew: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the only Jewish kid in my (third-grade) class," Leibman says. "My mom 
split me and Nina so we didn't have to compete. My teacher had me tell about 
Hanukkah, and (another girl) had to talk about Christmas. And she gets up, 8 
years old, and (says) all the Jews and infidels are going to burn in hell. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I remember sitting there thinking, 'I should say something.' The teacher 
took me out in the hall, 'You know (she) really doesn't know what she's saying. 
She's heard what her parents said. . . .' She knows what she's saying. I 
thought it was peculiar the teacher would say this to me but not the class." 
</P>
<P>
 Leibman went on to graduate magna cum laude from UC San Diego. She considered 
a career as a doctor or medical researcher, but didn't like the idea of 
choosing a specialty. "I always had a good aptitude for math and an interest in 
science, but I'm much more macro level."  
</P>
<P>
 What ultimately led her to the law, she says, was another gift: "I always 
liked to talk, I was a good talker, and one of the things that appealed to me 
about law school was I could use that as a skill, as opposed to (it) being 
something that was detrimental." 
</P>
<P>
 She got her degree from Hastings College of Law at UC San Francisco in 1981, 
but a job in a large firm eluded her. "I watched my classmates who had grades 
that were poorer than mine getting offers," she says. "It took hindsight to 
really look at this and say it had to do with the fact that I was female." 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna suggests that others felt the same way. "Women of Abby's generation, 
our generation, grew up with a sense of entitlement that was slightly ahead of 
what our opportunities really were. We confronted a wall that was still there 
as we were coming of age." 
</P>
<P>
 In her last year of law school and briefly after graduation, Leibman worked 
for the county government and was faced with fending off a physically 
aggressive, ranking co-worker. She was upset, she says, but did nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, I was on the phone with a staff person from the House Budget 
Committee, and this man came into my area, a cubicle, and he kissed me. He 
tried to kiss me on the mouth, but I turned my head so it hit me right here," 
she says, touching her left cheek. "I was really freaked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Leibman went to her supervisor, who advised her to put up a sign saying that 
sexual harassment would not be tolerated. But, Leibman says, "I didn't do 
anything. . . . Here I was a lawyer already, and a raging feminist, and I 
couldn't do anything. . . ." Even so, the harassment soon ended. "I am 
eternally grateful to (that supervisor)," she says, "because she had taken care 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Two jobs later, Leibman was monitoring job advancement for women on the Los 
Angeles Unified School District's Commission for Sex Equity. Her work there, 
she says, made her recognize the importance of quality child care to working 
women and eventually led to the Child Care Law Project at Public Counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had really thought about what I was doing," Leibman says of launching 
the law center, "I would have really have gotten overwhelmed. Just think about 
it one little step at a time, and you can do it. You just keep your goals 
manageable." 
</P>
<P>
 She has used that incremental approach to chip away at such problems as 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Leibman and Phyllis Cheng, her former boss at the LAUSD, formed the 
California Equity Council. Along with a team of experts, they drafted model 
regulations for compliance with the 1982 state law banning sex discrimination 
in education. The council eventually disbanded for lack of funds, but Leibman 
would later press the issue, making it the law center's first "case."  
</P>
<P>
 "The original state regulations were a joke," Leibman says, "virtually a 
repetition of the prohibition against discrimination, nothing more than that. 
No detail, no guidance, no specificity at all about what schools and school 
districts were responsible for and what students could count on." 
</P>
<P>
 After written and oral testimony, the education department in 1993 adopted a 
set of considerably more comprehensive guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leibman is not satisfied. While the state's rules apply to courses and 
athletics, she says, they don't address sexual harassment or extracurricular 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, school districts have no guidance on what the definition of sexual 
harassment means, how it should be applied, what their liability is, what to do 
if there is a sexual harassment incident. The same is true of extracurricular. 
. . . Is it OK to say that in order to be part of the Math Club you have to 
have taken calculus? But what if we happen to see that only boys take 
calculus?" 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the law center will go to court for the first time as a plaintiff 
in a suit against state education officials to compel them to comply with the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 But the law center rarely uses the courtroom. Instead, Leibman and her 
colleagues -- Roberta Ikemi and Susan Berke Fogel -- write briefs, testify at 
hearings, run meetings and lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Leibman gets four minutes to make a case to a police 
commission subcommittee for having an independent civilian unit investigate 
racial and sexual harassment complaints within the LAPD. She uses only 2 1/2, 
arguing that departmental loyalty has its downside. "To report to those who may 
share some allegiance to the person whom you are accusing can be an enormous 
chilling factor," Leibman says. 
</P>
<P>
 On another afternoon, she meets with a dozen core members of the Women's 
Coalition, organized by Leibman in the aftermath of the 1992 civil unrest. 
Encompassing more than 70 Los Angeles groups -- from Parents of Watts to 
Mothers of East L.A. to the Junior League to the American Jewish Congress, on 
whose regional council she sits -- the coalition issued an 80-page "Blueprint" 
in March for rebuilding the city. Now, the members are trying to pare down the 
76-item list to a more manageable two dozen. "If you don't even raise (the 
rest)," Leibman says later, "they will never get (dealt with) or be part of 
anybody's consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 Her ability to manage such complex issues has made Leibman an important 
sounding board for public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's aggressive without being offensive -- without taking 'no' for an 
answer, without being in your face. But mostly she's very knowledgeable," says 
City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who has known Leibman since 1983. "If you 
ask, 'How do you think we could approach this?' or 'How do other people do it?' 
she's done her homework, and that's very impressive to someone who has as much 
on their plate as a city council or school board member." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Fogel monitors zoning ordinances for family day care in much of 
Southern California and is also working with Loyola Law School to set up a 
legal clinic for breast cancer patients. Ikemi specializes in welfare reform 
and domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 On the latter front, the center has helped push state laws for courts to issue 
restraining orders around the clock and for judges to take domestic abuse into 
account when deciding custody cases. It has also supported clemency petitions, 
arguing "battered women's syndrome," for women who killed their abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Gov. Pete Wilson) did grant clemency to a couple of women," Leibman says, 
"and now the rest of those petitions are sitting on his desk." 
</P>
<P>
 Ikemi says they are exploring other strategies for battered women serving 
murder sentences, such as writs of habeas corpus. "The whole area is up in the 
air until after the (state) election because you never know how a different 
governor might react," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With such a heavy agenda, time is precious. Leibman's two-bedroom condo, with 
a spectacular view of Downtown from the bedroom window, is a short drive to the 
office. And although she loves movies and murder mysteries and baking chocolate 
chip cookies, her weekends sometimes give way to business. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a member of the Saturday Group, made up of a dozen or so baby-boom 
political and media insiders who meet every six weeks to discuss such 
big-picture issues as California's economy or crime. John Emerson, a former 
chief deputy city attorney who is now an aide to President Clinton, invited 
Leibman to join. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also spent three weekends in Palm Springs this summer with 
work-related friends. The escapes began with what has become a kind of 
political "Big Chill" -- an annual Memorial Day gathering thrown by Grueul, now 
a deputy to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, at her 
parents' condo. 
</P>
<P>
 A doting aunt, Leibman thinks she might like to have children someday. As for 
marriage, she says, "I haven't thought of this as a closed book yet. . . . If 
I'm in a relationship and it feels right to have children, then I will have 
children with that man. It doesn't have to be the big 'M.' It could be whatever 
is a committed intimate relationship with a man. I don't want to be a single 
parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Leibman's five-year plan is to stick with her work -- and to do more of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to still be doing the kinds of work that I'm doing now, and I don't 
know if I'll still be at the law center. I know what I want the law center to 
be . . . certainly much bigger. I also would love for it to have branch 
offices, like in San Diego, in the middle part of the state and also in the Bay 
Area." 
</P>
<P>
 And after that, she talks about maybe going to Washington -- if family 
responsibilities don't prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
 As a congresswoman perhaps? 
</P>

 She smiles. "Not run for Congress. I want someone to say, ' Here. Here's a 
congressional district, it's yours.' The campaigning part doesn't appeal to me 
in the least." Abby J. Leibman 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: No. Born in New York, raised in Chatsworth, now lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Marital status: Single. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Anything chocolate, her 5-year-old nephew and 3-year-old niece, 
murder mysteries, the law. 
</P>
<P>
 On women and welfare: "We're committed to doing a solid educational effort 
about who is on welfare and why, because we think there is a mythology around 
the idea that women either choose to do this or that these women are somehow 
alien from the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
 On being a feminist: "Because I believe that women are the colleagues of men, 
that I am not less than, I am not greater than, I am working very hard to make 
sure that both men and women realize that." 
</P>
<P>
 On sexual harassment versus free speech: "I think that the First Amendment 
should not and does not protect sexual harassment. Whether or not the courts 
will ever agree with me on this remains to be seen. If what you're doing is 
hurting people, that is not protected speech." 
</P>
<P>
 On growing up with a twin: "(It's) an interesting mix of having a constant 
companion, and you always have somebody there who's your friend. And then also 
this notion that you have never been, you're never separate, you're never 
alone."

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP AL NIGHT: OPERA COMES A LA CARTE AT MICELI'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scene is a starlit village square set for a feast; a jumble of 
red-and-white checked tablecloths spills over terraces, balconies and arcades 
of stucco, brick, stained glass and wrought iron. A black cat prowls a rooftop. 
Through an archway, one catches a glimpse of gondolas plying Venetian canals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like Pirates of the Caribbean," says waiter Steven Ted Beckler. 
</P>
<P>
 If Disney ever decides to do "The Barber of Seville" or "Figaro," Miceli's 
could provide the set -- and the cast, for that matter. The waiters and 
waitresses are operatically trained, with credits that include "Phantom of the 
Opera" and "Les Miserables." 
</P>
<P>
 But to say that they sing would be an understatement, for they do much more 
than belt out opera and show tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 To dine at Miceli's is to participate in an evening of free-for-all musical 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Wall is uncorking a bottle of wine for her customers when four roving 
tenors pounce on her and make off with the bottle, singing lustily. Wall goes 
after them, snapping her fingers sternly. The lads return the filched vino and 
descend upon a young couple's romantic tete-a-tete. One of them sidles up to 
the pretty girl, while another leaps onto the back of the booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, on bended knee, Wall sings a tender Italian aria to a little boy here 
for his parents' anniversary party. The boy gazes into her eyes in a state of 
absolute rapture; Mickey Mouse never sang like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to audition to get a job here," Beckler says, "and they don't care 
if you know how to wait tables." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Jim Miceli agrees. He is one of the three brothers who run the 
Cahuenga restaurant. His father owns the original Miceli's on Las Palmas, the 
second-oldest restaurant in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can make a waiter out of a singer, but I can't make a singer out of a 
waiter," Miceli says. "These people are great. We know this is only a temporary 
stop for them and we try to support them. I hope they all make it to the top." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked here for six years," says Beckler, who has performed with the 
Sacramento Music Circus and the San Bernardino Civic Light Opera; he's 
currently playing Gaston in the Disneyland stage show of "Beauty and the 
Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've driven buses, I worked on the Queen Mary as a bellhop, I sold shoes. 
This is a great place to be. If I have an audition or a callback, I can call up 
within five minutes of when I'm supposed to start (my shift) and they'll cover 
for me. If I get a show, I can leave for three months, then come back when it's 
over. It's a family. I even play golf with Jim." 
</P>
<P>
 The staff's sense of real and spontaneous fun is infectious. The servers' 
bravura antics are always charming, never embarrassing to their victims in the 
way so much audience-participation theater can be. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the attention to the dramatic arts, the food manages to come and go on 
schedule, and it lives up to the entertainment. Clearly the cooks are hired for 
their culinary rather than musical skills. Nothing trendy here, just classic 
Italian dishes and good house-brand Chianti. The Caesar salad is especially 
good, and the lost art of the tender chicken breast is still practiced here. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, you can save your tough tofu and reedy folk songs for another night. This 
is Old Hollywood in all its sweet and succulent glory, the place to go for 
birthdays, anniversaries and the House Special -- marriage proposals, for which 
you can reserve the Valentine's Table, a table for two on its own wrought-iron 
balcony.  
</P>
<P>
 "A couple named the Mayfields started it. They've been coming here for 
Valentine's Day for the past eight years. The table used to be just a 
decorative prop, but they asked to use it and it's been popular ever since, 
especially for proposals." 
</P>
<P>
 Miceli chuckles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time, the house knows about it before she does, because the guy 
asks us to do something special, like bring the ring in a dish of spumoni. 
Everyone sings and stares at them, and applauds." 
</P>

 We have seen the future, and it looks uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Pasta Etc. on Sunset Plaza, three distinguished-looking men were 
holding their coffee cups and smoking their after-lunch cigars while seated on 
the restaurant's curb. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that even though they were dining at the restaurant's outdoor tables, 
that wasn't good enough for their anti-secondhand-smoke neighbors.

 A Tall, Hot One: What do people drink on one of the hottest, humidest, most 
wretched days of summer? 
</P>
<P>
 As we placed our order for a frosty iced nonfat half-caf latte at our local 
Starbucks, we were dumbfounded as customer after customer ordered hot coffees. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? we discretely asked a few of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It stimulates me, cools me down. It's more psychological than anything. I 
used to work ona boat where it was real hot and we always drank coffee," said a 
burly man. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, if you drink hot coffee, your body temperature goes up and you don't 
react to how hot it is outside," pontificated another. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 20 years I lived in Central Utah where it's bitter cold. I'd rather sweat 
than freeze any day," said a customer going back for a refill.

 Highway Horseplay: Slogging back home on the 405 from our monthly trek to the 
Rose Bowl flea market -- where we happily haggled over a matching pair of 
Fiesta nut dishes -- we spotted a girl, passing us on the left, who was wearing 
a bikini top that matched her metallic-lavender Mustang convertible. Her hair 
clip was lavender too. 
</P>
<P>
 Then our savvy flea-market friends started pointing out more young, carefree 
types cruising around in Mustang convertibles. We thought off-road vehicles 
were trendy, we mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 " Everybody rents Mustangs in Hawaii," we were told, feeling slightly out of 
it.

DEFINING FREEDOM FROM A POST-MENOPAUSAL PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found Pamela Warrick's article about menopause and estrogen replacement 
("Feminists Face Off in War Over Menopause," Aug. 9) both ridiculous and 
harmful to the many women who are undecided about the safety of estrogen 
replacement therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up believing that "hot flashes" were a figment of a woman's imagination 
and that as a modern woman I was above such things -- that is, until I started 
experiencing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year tens of thousands of women's lives are made more productive through 
estrogen therapy. I don't see "keeping a stiff upper lip" and suffering the 
discomfort of hot flashes and depression, loss of enjoyment in sex, losing bone 
mass and increased risk of broken or painful bones, increased risk of heart 
attack, and a slowing of my intellectual ability as a means of fighting a 
feminist battle. 
</P>
<P>
 If "free" women have to go into battle hunched over, on crutches, with weak 
hearts or reduced mental powers, give me bondage any day.

 I am living, "vigorously striding" proof that Dr. Robert A. Wilson is wrong 
when he says, "It is not unusual to see an erect man of 75 vigorously striding 
along on a golf course, but never a woman of this age." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do I "vigorously stride" three miles every morning and play nine 
holes of golf sans cart every week, but I have seven years on Dr. Wilson's 
erect man of 75. 
</P>
<P>
 And I went through menopause without a hitch or hot flash and with no pills or 
estrogen intake. So take back your words, Dr. Wilson.

SPANKING SHOULD BE UN-AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The answer to your question "To Spank or Not to Spank?" (Aug. 10) is an 
unequivocal not to spank.  
</P>
<P>
 How ludicrous and insensitive for anyone to suggest that hitting a child of 
any age is part of being "reasonably disciplined."Spanking is hitting. 
Remember, there was a time when it was "reasonable" to hit your wife and your 
slave. 
</P>
<P>
 It is interesting that there are still people around who want to hide behind 
our Constitution to allow parents to be violent with their children. It is 
noted in the article that the U.S. Constitution protects our "privacy interests 
and liberty interests." Let me remind those who use this argument that children 
are people also and are entitled to their privacy and liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come for the United States of America to join the other countries 
that have decided to make spanking and humiliation unacceptable and illegal 
behavior for parents and teachers everywhere.

AS MANY CAVEWOMEN AS THERE ARE CAVEMEN?

 Robin Abcarian's column on the "neo-Neanderthal" males of the Citadel was 
enlightening ("Just Another Harebrained Tradition at the Citadel," Aug. 10). 
</P>
<P>
 In order to assure her readers of her objective integrity, perhaps she could 
give us a similar piece on the "neo-Neanderthal" females of Mills College.

 I attend an all-girls high school and would be very upset if a male sued to 
get into our school. The whole reason I go there is so that I don't have to 
worry about impressing the opposite sex or worrying about what they think about 
me when I really should be working on my studies. I also don't have to worry 
about being harassed and I can just work on being myself. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules seem fair to me. Asking Shannon Faulkner to get her head shaved is 
no big deal. She wanted to go this all-male school. Now she should have to 
follow all the rules just like the other cadets.

ON LOVE, MARRIAGE AND CATHOLICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, that mean ol' Catholic Church is at it again ("They Say Love Conquers 
All -- Will It Now?" Aug. 8). Imagine -- trying to uphold their standards 
regarding such little ol' things as marriage and Catholic education.The nerve 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Gosh -- to think that he likes rock and she likes the Chicago Bulls. After 
all, he wooed her with "corny lines" and they spend their evenings planted in 
"a spongy green couch playing video games, betting quarters on cards." That 
surely demonstrates that Jennifer, age 17, and Caesar, age 25, have mastered 
what The Times regards as the requirements of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 And those mean ol' priests. Just look at Father Gregory Coiro. I mean, he's 
"sober robed" and a "big, ruddy-faced man with a serious gaze." Well, who you 
gonna trust, anyhow -- someone like that? I mean Father Coiro must be right out 
of Charles Dickens.

MANSON'S MADNESS STILL BRINGS PAIN

 I am appalled by the attention that Charles Manson receives in the media these 
days ("Behind the Madness," Aug. 8). Why do you call attention to this 
murderer? 
</P>
<P>
 I was 9 years old when this occurred. I still, to this day, don't know much 
about the victims. I am sure that when Mr. Manson finally passes into his 
eternal hell, we will (once again) know more about him and his death than we 
will ever know about Sharon Tate and the other victims.

 Theo Wilson should have taken the time to reread "Helter Skelter" before

 Aug. 9, 1969, is a date forever embedded in the minds of Angelenos old enough 
to remember the terror and fear that swept the city in the wake of the carnage 
caused by Charles Manson and his band of psychos. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson to attempt a flip, comedic piece that bespoke of a bunch of old 
boys enjoying an exciting, illicit weekend is truly appalling.  
</P>
<P>
 Quotes such as "Oh, that's just old Charlie yakking," along with depictions of 
the trial with its "dropouts, druggies and flower children" as representing 
"the whole West Coast at is zaniest' equates to some of the most tasteless 
journalism I have read in a long, long time.

HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD IS NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I just finished reading Tony Mostrom's "Cartoon Tour of Hollywood Blvd." (Aug. 
7) and was appalled by your apparent lack of investigation prior to printing 
this full-page, derogatory "cartoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the efforts of Mayor Riordan, Council member Jackie Goldberg, the 
C.R.A., the Hollywood Beautification Team, the Hollywood Entertainment Museum, 
the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, and many more individuals and groups, the 
boulevard is no longer what Mr. Mostrom depicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets are scrubbed at least once a day, graffiti is removed almost 
instantaneously, the sidewalks have been upgraded with benches and beautiful 
palm trees, the facades of most of the historical buildings have been upgraded 
and painted, and safety is ensured by private security patrolmen in addition to 
the LAPD on foot and on bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Boulevard is known throughout the world and tourists do come to see 
the Walk of Fame and other attractions. Its star is once again rising to become 
a final destination for world tourism.

 Tony Mostrom's vision of Hollywood Boulevard is all too true. When my 
out-of-town visitors want to see it, I talk them out of it because it is so 
degrading to all of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Mike Woo lost his bid for mayor; he cited Hollywood as evidence of 
how he could clean things up.

 I am offended that The Times would print a depiction of Hollywood Boulevard 
that clearly doesn't tell the real story. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has lived anywhere in the City of Los Angeles during the past 30 
years (including myself and the cynical Mr. Mostrom) has seen a general decline 
in what we all refer to as the "quality of life." While Hollywood has not been 
immune to this trend, neither is it the armpit of the city that Mr. Mostrom 
portrays it to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Revitalization is under way and a great deal of progress has been made. When 
was the last time Mr. Mostrom was out on the boulevard? 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than actively promoting the negative perception of the Hollywood 
community, The Times should be interested in informing its readers of the real 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 I invite you and Mr. Mostrom to take a real tour of the boulevard with members 
of the chamber's board of directors. Let us show you the success stories of the 
revitalization efforts. I promise, the "charm is not gone."

 Feeling as strongly as I do, I must perforce protest the colorization of your 
newspaper. Every day I open the paper now, I almost shudder because I know I am 
going to be given a visual shock by crudely colored, garish pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The last straw was the Life & Style of Aug. 7. Now, I ask you -- who wants to 
look at the huge, mustachioed face of a sports agent, veins and all, at 
breakfast time? 
</P>
<P>
 The cartoon of Hollywood Boulevard was just as distasteful -- and positively 
juvenile. All of it true and in black & white might have been clever, but Tony 
Mostrom's vision does not belong in the Los Angeles Times and you should not 
let your paper sink to the level of Heavy Metal and R. Crumb's Weirdo 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is your idea of style, then heaven help us.

something less than marquee position -- at the sandwich shop's back entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the telephone pole signs, which sometimes work so well 
together. Consider the "Lose Weight" and "Fudge" signs we spotted -- one above 
the other -- on a pole in Marina del Rey. A symbiotic advertising strategy if 
there ever was one.

 A GOOD TURN WITH MANY TWISTS: Being a good Samaritan isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Acapulco/Beverly Hills Sister City program arranged to have a 
kidney dialysis machine donated and shipped to a public hospital in Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
 At the dedication ceremony in February, the donors were warmly thanked for the 
expensive blood cleansing machine, but were told that nobody at the hospital 
knew how to operate it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it was quite a surprise, finding out they couldn't use the thing," said 
Janet Salter, a Beverly Hills' member of the sister city program. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Salter and her husband, former Beverly Hills Mayor Max Salter, 
agreed to put up a doctor and two nurses from the Acapulco hospital while they 
were trained on the kidney dialysis machine. During the six-week training 
program, the Salters and other volunteers shuttled the visitors between 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Salter was informed the kidney dialysis machine will need filters 
and other expensive supplies to keep it running. And a technician may need to 
come to Los Angeles to learn how to maintain the machine. And Acapulco's water 
supply needs to be sampled. And the Acapulco hospital's water pressure needs to 
be checked. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Salter: "We should have just sent bandages." 
</P>

 CAR TALK: Granted, it is the socially conscious '90s. So maybe it shouldn't be 
surprising that a car manufacturer is trying to reach women (51% of the 
population and 49% of all car buyers) by hosting a discussion of women's issues 
-- in a car showroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The Infiniti luxury car division of Nissan Motor Corp. is hosting its third 
annual Infiniti Women's Forum, a nationwide event. Invited guests will take to 
the showrooms (on the Westside, the company's showroom in Beverly Hills) to 
hear a discussion on women's issues ranging from health care to career success 
to female unity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills event will feature a discussion titled "Women Today: Coping, 
Leading, Succeeding." 
</P>
<P>
 And, it might be added, buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Faith, Nissan Division news bureau coordinator, says no sales 
representatives will be present at the showroom discussions. But clearly, the 
company hopes that participants will take stock of their surroundings.

FIRE OFFICIALS TO ENFORCE BRUSH CLEARANCE CODES; MALIBU: PROPERTY OWNERS FACE 
PROSECUTION IF THEY FAIL TO CUT BRUSH TO A MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF 3 INCHES WITHIN 
100 FEET OF ANY STRUCTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Taking a tough stance to prevent a repeat of last year's disastrous wildfire, 
Malibu city officials are preparing to prosecute landowners who violate the 
municipal fire code's brush-clearance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed to be the first time a city served by the Los Angeles County 
Fire Department has sought to use prosecution to enforce brush-clearing 
requirements, said Chief Paul H. Rippens of the county Fire Department's 
forestry division. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what should be done," Rippens said. "I guess after the fire last 
November it really woke up a sleeping giant out there, and the people, the city 
and the homeowners are upset over the loss of homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to avoid a similar tragedy, the city earmarked $10,000 of its legal 
budget in May for the prosecution of property owners who fail to cut all brush 
down to a height of 3 inches or less within 100 feet of any structure and to 
clear all brush within 200-feet of structures in so-called high hazard areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners were warned as early as February, when the Los Angeles County 
Department of Agriculture sent notices requiring brush clearance by May. Then 
the county Fire Department made its first round of inspections, notifying about 
150 property owners to comply within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials reinspected the properties, referring the remaining offenders 
to the city prosecutor, who earlier this summer sent letters asking for brush 
clearance within 14 days, said Sarah Maurice, the city's code enforcement 
officer. Fire officials are now conducting final inspections of the properties 
that were out of compliance, mostly in the city's western end -- the 
brush-dense Malibu Park area, which was untouched by last year's firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 One resident, who had received a letter from the city and subsequently 
complied, applauded the city's intentions while objecting to the use of 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like getting a notice in the mail that said, 'If you don't do this, 
we'll do that,' " said Benedict Freedman, a resident of Latigo Canyon since 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
 But Freedman added: "We've been through several fires, losing a house in 1972. 
We liked the chief telling us that we ought to cut down vegetation around our 
driveway so he could get his machinery up here. I like the idea that it is in 
their plan to fight for the houses of Latigo Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had begun discussing the creation of an aggressive 
brush-clearing program a month before last year's wildfires. After the November 
firestorm, the program was viewed as essential. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Maurice, 30 of the 150 properties found to be out of compliance 
on the first brush inspection have received a final inspection. Of those, he 
said, half remained out of compliance. The owners of the 15 parcels will be 
cited for an infraction, punishable by a fine, and must appear before a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am surprised by the number of people who refuse to recognize that brush 
clearance is endangering not just them but their whole neighborhood," Maurice 
said. "You may have a fancy (fire resistant) foam system or a (water) pump, but 
it won't do a hill of beans without brush clearance. The history is (fire) 
happens every eight to 10 years. We have tried to keep public awareness lifted 
so that Malibu doesn't have to burn to remind people." 
</P>
<P>
 In that spirit, the city and Los Angeles County Fire Department sponsored a 
Fire Preparedness Fair last weekend. About 66 vendors set up booths in the 
Civic Center parking lot, selling a panoply of goods, including pumps to draw 
water from hot tubs and pools, ceiling sprinklers, generators, "fire-safe" 
roofing, steel tiles, concrete building materials, steel-frame houses, and fire 
resistant foams and sprays. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,000 people attended, some from as far away as San Luis Obispo and San 
Diego. About $10,000 of the proceeds from booth rentals at the fair will be 
used to fund the city's Emergency Preparedness Study Group Plan, said Ted 
Ravinett, chairman of the fair and of the city's Emergency Preparedness Study 
Group, which has designed a 12-part emergency action plan for future Malibu 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who were burned out are still walking around in a daze," said 
Ravinett, whose condo below Pepperdine University has survived three Malibu 
fires over the last 16 years. "No place is safe in Malibu. (Another fire) is 
coming. It just depends on where the winds blow." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire survivor Art London, whose house in Carbon Mesa burned down during last 
year's fire, has plans to rebuild his home but has not yet received city 
approval for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard not to be fatalistic," said London, a retired attorney who was 
shopping the booths in the 97-degree heat. "We could not even begin to get to 
our house during the fire and neither could the Fire Department. . . . We had a 
pump, but it burned to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The more fortunate, such as Manfred J. Neuss, a resident of Calabasas whose 
home survived last November's fire, shopped with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in preventive medicine," he said, carrying an armload of product 
information pamphlets. "I plan on buying a pump. I live in Vista Point. No 
one's house burned there." 
</P>
<P>
 To hammer home the finer points of fire prevention, firefighters ignited 
wooden models treated with fire resistant materials, demonstrating the rate at 
which treated structures burn compared to untreated ones. Before the fires were 
set, a public information officer for the Fire Department issued an ominous 
three-part warning: "The brush has dried out a month ahead of schedule. We have 
Santa Anas still to come. And no hope of more moisture." 
</P>
<P>
 But the main message from fire officials, backed up by the city's 
determination to prosecute violators of brush-clearing requirements, is that no 
amount of "fire safety equipment" will stop fire from consuming a house with 
dense brush, grasses and trees growing next to it.  
</P>
<P>
 "A recent study done at UC Berkeley on the (1991) Oakland fire and the (1990) 
Santa Barbara fire found that houses with a 30-foot defensible space had a 91% 
survival rate," Rippens said. "And those with 100-foot clearance had a 98% 
survival rate. Those are good odds there."

CULVER CITY TO CONSIDER TAX DISTRICT TO AID LIBRARIES; FUNDS: OFFICIALS WILL 
DECIDE MONDAY WHETHER TO JOIN THE SPECIAL PARCEL DISTRICT. SO FAR, 10 CITIES 
HAVE VOTED TO PARTICIPATE. THE PLAN WOULD RAISE ABOUT $30 MILLION. 
</P>

<P>
 Culver City officials will decide Monday whether to join a special parcel tax 
assessment district that would help restore library services to their levels 
before the recent county budget crisis stripped funds from the branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan proposed by the County Board of Supervisors last month, 
property owners in cities covered by the county library system such as Culver 
City would be charged $28.50 per parcel. Owners of multifamily residential 
properties would pay $21.38 per unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The county library system operates 87 branches serving 3.3 million people in 
52 cities and 28 unincorporated communities. Library officials say they hope to 
raise $30 million from the levy. 
</P>
<P>
 So far 10 cities, including West Hollywood and Malibu, have voted to join the 
so-called Community Facilities District, similar to special assessment 
districts that help pay for such services as fire protection and flood 
prevention in some areas. Sixteen cities have balked, primarily over concerns 
about additional taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 All month, information sessions sponsored by county library officials have 
been held in the cities and communities they serve. The 28 libraries in the 
unincorporated areas, which are governed by the Board of Supervisors, would 
automatically become part of the library district; each incorporated city's 
council must vote to join. Those that do not do so may see further cuts in 
service to their branches because they would not receive the extra funds from 
the parcel tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors decided to see how the cities voted before formally 
considering the proposal on Aug. 30. If approved, the charge will be reflected 
in November tax bills. County library officials said that each year the Board 
of Supervisors will reconsider the levy. 
</P>
<P>
 County Librarian Sandra Reuben said if the plan is not approved, the library 
will have to continue to rely on funding from the state, which could mean more 
cutbacks in services. The libraries were first hit with budget cuts in 1992 
when the state borrowed money from counties to cover its deficit. Last year, 
the state took $600 million in property taxes from the county, which led to the 
libraries' cuts in hours and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have $7.5 million less than what I need to run the libraries for the rest 
of the year," Reuben said. "If the (district) is not enacted, we will have to 
drastically trim back materials and staff. We've already been stretched to the 
breaking point." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Culver City library, there are county-run libraries in 
Marina del Rey and View Park; Culver City's library is the largest and most 
heavily used of the three. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City library manager Josie Zoretich said that since last year's budget 
cuts, one full-time employee was laid off and six part-timers left because of 
the reduced hours, leaving the staff at six full-timers and 16 part-timers. The 
library, once open 63 hours and seven days a week, has been reduced to 28 
hours, four days a week. Culver City library's 1991-92 materials budget (books, 
periodicals and audiovisual equipment) was $136,000, but the next year only 
$48,674 was allocated. Zoretich said after the budget cuts they had to cancel 
subscriptions to 300 newspapers, magazines and government document materials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Council members last week had mixed feelings about the plan, which will be the 
subject of a public hearing during the Monday City Council meeting at 7 p.m. 
Mayor Albert Vera said he favored the proposal, calling it "a little token of 
appreciation from the citizens." Councilman Steve Gourley said he was on the 
fence about it because he believes the county misspends its funds. 
</P>
<P>
 If Culver City officials decline to join the district, Zoretich said the 
library will have to cut its hours to open only twice a week. "That would be 
such a waste of resources," Zoretich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, although city officials say most Culver City residents welcome the 
prospect of restored services guaranteed by the new funding source, there is 
apprehension about the library tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is going to object to being taxed," said David Miller, a longtime 
Culver City resident who wants to keep the library open more hours, but is 
opposed to the tax. Miller said he is angry that county officials did not see 
financing the library as a priority in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 A parent with two school-age children, Shelley Shapiro said she usually votes 
for taxes that will support libraries and schools. But she wonders if the 
libraries will benefit at all from the parcel tax. "It's like the Lotto. I 
wonder if (county officials) will spend the money somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben said the money collected from the library tax cannot be used in any 
other area, and will be applied to the city library branch where the fees are 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, county library officials are awaiting the passage of an Assembly 
bill that would prevent the further shift of property tax from county 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben said she is disappointed that more cities haven't voted to join the 
district. Those cities that don't join, she added, will see further cuts in 
library services, and some may have to close. Among the cities that have said 
no are Avalon, Hidden Hills and Manhattan Beach, which is looking into 
subsidizing its branch.

ACTRESS ENJOYS LATEST ROLE AS AUTHOR 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Actress Diane Shalet began to rehearse the role of a recently widowed woman. 
The petite, strawberry-blonde sipped a glass of lemonade while gazing across 
the street at two Jehovah's Witnesses. The widow watched the couple as they 
walked from house to house, knocking on doors. They looked at her house and 
approached. Looking a bit surprised and unsure of what to do, the widow decided 
to let them in. She opened the door, welcoming their company. 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfied with the scene, Shalet did not go before the cameras to shoot a 
take. She sat down at her typewriter and pounded out a chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 That is literally how all the characters in Shalet's new book, "Grief in a 
Sunny Climate," came to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, which chronicles the often-comedic experiences of a widow in her 40s 
trying to get her life back on track after the death of her husband, is 
Shalet's first venture as a novelist. Instead of waiting for divine inspiration 
to help her create characters and scenarios, once she had an idea, she acted it 
out at home using props. Shalet wrote only if, after performing a scene, it 
seemed realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't trained as a writer and the process of putting lives and lines on 
paper intimidated me," said Shalet, a veteran actress who divides her time 
between West Hollywood and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has landed countless roles in plays, radio, television and 
feature films during her 30-year career, writing was a private hobby -- nothing 
she had ever considered doing professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 But the shift in careers has proved to be successful. Released by St. Martin's 
Press in June, Shalet's book has been praised by critics. The New York Times 
lauded her in a recent book review for crafting a "deceptively silly story to 
disguise some serious lessons about sorrow and dependency." 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring out how to develop her story line and characters was the biggest 
challenge for Shalet. When she first began writing what eventually became 
"Grief in a Sunny Climate," she said she had no intention of becoming an 
author. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is loosely based on her own experience. Like the protagonist Babe, 
Shalet had a hard time dealing with her husband's death. After Shalet's spouse 
of 11 years died more than a decade ago, she roamed bookstores looking for 
self-help texts to guide her through grieving. 
</P>
<P>
 But the books she found offered her no comfort, so she began keeping a journal 
instead. During that time, she also joined a Santa Barbara-based writers group 
to learn more about writing techniques -- something she had always wanted to do 
but hadn't had the time. 
</P>
<P>
 When Shalet mustered enough courage to share her journal entries with group 
members, they unanimously told her she had a novel in the works. Her entries 
read more like short stories, she was told, and the unfinished work was so 
impressive, she won the Santa Barbara Writers Conference first prize for 
fiction writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet instead of building her confidence, winning the award made her more 
insecure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a big block after I won the prize," Shalet said. "It was like a burden 
on my shoulders. But those feelings finally exhausted themselves when I decided 
I had to . . . just have fun writing." 
</P>
<P>
 To help her just have fun and get the creative juices flowing, Shalet used a 
tool that came more naturally to her -- acting. She created mini stage settings 
complete with props and, using her improvisational skills, played all the parts 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "When your imagination takes over, you become a better writer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalet's comedic talents proved to be handy as well. She did not want Babe's 
story to be one of merely tears and gloominess, so she has Babe go through a 
series of slapstick adventures on her journey of self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grief is not neat," Shalet explained. "It's a loopy roller coaster" that 
takes one through a range of emotions -- from sadness and despair to finding 
humor in mundane scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalet borrows a quote from British dramatist and critic George Bernard Shaw 
to describe her feelings about humor and bereavement: "Life does not cease to 
be funny when people die, any more than it ceases to be serious when people 
laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll go mad if we don't laugh," she said.

 Westside Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) has won Assembly support 
for a bill intended to ensure that state agencies don't waste public funds when 
purchasing computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen's bill, which has won Assembly approval and is scheduled to be 
considered in the Senate next week, would create a peer review body to consult

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; SALAD DRESSING GIVES YOUNG CRENSHAW ENTREPRENEURS A 
TASTE OF SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As temperatures were hitting record highs in the city on Aug. 13-14, a group 
of student entrepreneurs were busy turning up the heat to promote their salad 
dressing at the latest market chain to sell their product: Mrs. Gooch's health 
food stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten Crenshaw High students wearing Food From the 'Hood aprons and bright 
smiles offered up tastes of their creamy Italian dressing on pita bread squares 
to shoppers in Beverly Hills, West Los Angeles, Redondo Beach, Sherman Oaks, 
Thousand Oaks, Glendale and Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from sales of the salad dressing, "Straight Out the Garden," benefit 
a scholarship fund for the nearly 30 students who co-own Food from the 'Hood, a 
produce business they launched on campus nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict on the dressing from health-conscious Westside and Valley 
customers: "They liked the taste a lot, but everybody asked if we had a low-fat 
or no-fat version," said 17-year-old Natasha Proby, who worked at the Beverly 
Hills store, selling 24 bottles of dressing. "That's what we're going to talk 
about at our next meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 The venture, which started as a project to rehabilitate a weedy patch of land 
near Crenshaw's football field, has mushroomed into a salad-dressing business 
with nationwide distribution in nearly 100 supermarkets and stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they won't reveal sales figures because of concerns about competition 
from makers of other dressings, students say they are on target with fiscal 
goals this year. And in January, Food From the 'Hood established an office in a 
converted biology lab on Crenshaw's campus to keep up with all the business.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're just growing by leaps and bounds," said biology teacher Tammy Bird, who 
helped students launch the business and gave up coaching soccer to devote more 
time to it. "We had the vision. . . . We just needed someone to believe in us 
enough to give us the money to really get going." 
</P>
<P>
 After getting $100,000 in cash and in-kind donations from the city and RLA 
last December, Food From the 'Hood set up its salad dressing line. With the 
help of food manufacturer Sweet Adelaide and salad-dressing entrepreneur Norris 
Bernstein and other professionals, the group was able to make, bottle and get 
its salad dressing onto grocery shelves via food brokers and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 After students settled on a recipe, the Hawthorne-based Sweet Adelaide made 
and packaged the dressing and local food brokers got busy selling "Straight Out 
the Garden." 
</P>
<P>
 The business was flying so high that even the Jan. 17 earthquake proved 
something of a blessing: The week that Crenshaw High shut down gave students 
time to put their office together without distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of public relations executive Melinda McMullen, who now works 
full time with the business, students cleaned out a room used to house animals 
for a traveling zoo project and set up $8,000 worth of office equipment. The 
office features a row of computer terminals, a phone, printer and fax machine, 
and a long marble-topped table where students gather for meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's moving real fast, faster than I thought it would," 16-year-old Ketric 
Jenkins said of the business, which still holds to its original tenet of 
regularly donating at least 25% of its garden-grown produce to charities such 
as Helpers for the Homeless and Hungry, a Crenshaw-based food bank. 
</P>
<P>
 All profits from dressing sales go to a college scholarship fund. Student 
owners receive shares of it based on academic performance, college preparation 
work and the amount of work they put into the business. They do not receive 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jenkins, a senior this year, the scholarship money will help keep him on 
the track to college. "I'm still tired from working all those stores last 
weekend, but it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Proby, reviewing a set of mock-up ad cards for Food From the 'Hood, said it's 
been gratifying for a cooperative run by young people in the inner city to get 
so much attention. But she hopes people won't lose sight of an even more 
significant fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to focus on our dressing -- it's good," she said. "We don't 
want them to just say, 'Oh, look at these poor kids, let's help them out.' We 
want to be judged by our product." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; FIRE DEPARTMENT SECRETARY FILES HARASSMENT LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Fire Department secretary has sued her former boss, the city and the city's 
former fire chief in a sexual and racial harassment dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Eva Lopez says former supervisor George Robert Lewis, a chief mechanic, 
created a "hostile work environment" and repeatedly subjected her to 
harassment.In addition to naming Lewis in the complaint, Lopez is suing former 
Fire Chief Michael Olson and Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The action filed Tuesday in Santa Monica Superior Court seeks unspecified 
compensatory and punitive damages, attorney Michael Leb said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was fired in July, about two months after Lopez complained he mistreated 
her through "ongoing sexual commentary and other acts of sexual harassment." 
She claims Lewis also made comments about her Mexican American heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis has appealed the termination. "We are confident he will be vindicated of 
all the charges and that he will be reinstated," said his attorney, Phillip 
Tangalakis. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson could not be reached and City Atty. Norman Herring declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said Olson and the city's personnel director and fire chief did not 
treat her complaints satisfactorily. Olson made excuses for Lewis and urged 
Lopez to "give it right back to him," Lopez charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson took early retirement after a recent Fire Department probe uncovering 
"numerous incidents of misuse of city property, manpower and improper 
supervisory practices."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; MOTION AGAINST RAPPER'S LAWYER DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has denied a motion that would have prevented the same lawyer from 
representing Snoop Doggy Dogg in a multimillion dollar civil suit and criminal 
proceedings against the rapper stemming from a shooting last year in Palms. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrongful death suit stems from the fatal Aug. 25 shooting of Phillip 
Woldemariam, 23, near a park on Motor Avenue.His parents are seeking $25 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have charged the rapper's bodyguard, McKinley Lee, in the 
shooting. Prosecutors say the 22-year-old rapper was driving Lee in a Jeep at 
the time of the shooting. Snoop Doggy Dogg, Lee and another passenger, Sean 
Abrams, 24, have also been charged in the criminal proceedings and have all 
pleaded innocent to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Alan Haber ruled that David E. Kenner can 
continue to represent the rapper, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, in both 
civil and criminal actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel J. Friedman, who represents the victim's parents, had argued that 
Kenner should be removed from the civil suit because he has an unfair 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 In his motion, Friedman wrote that Kenner was "using the criminal action to 
obtain material information without first notifying the plaintiffs." The 
documents included the victim's medical records, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenner said his dual representation does not create conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "My position is very simple, there is no legal or ethical standard or statute 
that prevents the same lawyer from handling the same civil and criminal cases," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenner said he filed a sealed document in which all the defendants involved 
consented to his work in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said the ruling was not a significant setback for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a classic case of losing a battle toward winning a war," he said.

<P>
 The city Bureau of Sanitation is operating its Mobile Hazardous Household 
Waste program in the Crenshaw/Hyde Park area Thursday through Saturday, going 
door to door to collect potentially hazardous waste materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Hazmobile" will allow residents to safely dispose of toxic wastes such as 
household cleaners, auto products and batteries, pesticides, herbicides, paint 
products and old medicines. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents must call the sanitation bureau at 1-(800)-98-TOXIC to make an 
appointment for pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose 6th District includes Hyde Park and the 
south Crenshaw area, said she encourages constituents to comb their garages, 
cupboards and medicine cabinets for hazardous materials.  
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, toxic waste goes into our sewer, storm drain system and 
landfills," she said. "We have to protect our families as well as our 
environment." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTWOOD; DEVELOPER AGREES TO BUY, REVITALIZE AILING WATERFRONT 
SHOPPING MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS , SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Westwood-based developer has agreed to purchase a troubled mall in Long 
Beach and plans to fill its empty spaces with well-known retailers, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers of the Trident Group said they will spend about $20 million 
remodeling the waterfront Marina Pacifica Mall on Pacific Coast Highway near 
2nd Street. The near-vacant mall is known for its dark, maze-like lower level 
and empty storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 The remodeled facility will include larger and fewer shops with most entrances 
at street level, said Chris Ellis, a Trident partner. A new Ralphs supermarket 
and a Barnes & Noble bookstore will anchor the mall, along with longtime 
tenants such as the AMC Theaters complex and Trader Joe's, he said. Some of the 
existing tenants may move to larger facilities in the center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis said he hopes to place six national retail outlets alongside about 15 
smaller shops catering to upscale residents in the Naples and Belmont Shore 
areas of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The remodeling will stress simplicity," Ellis said. "The original design may 
have worked at the center's inception, but in the end it did not work." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis would not reveal how much his firm paid for the 290,000-square-foot 
property. Remodeling should begin early next year after nontoxic oil deposits 
beneath the mall are removed, Ellis said. The expanded facility is expected to 
open in the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Co. in Newport Beach has managed the mall for Bank of America since 
1992. Connie W. Hahn, Koll's manager at the mall, said about four buyers have 
withdrawn from deals to purchase the property since Bank of America acquired it 
during a 1989 foreclosure. The mall has had several owners since it was built 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina Pacifica is currently 28% occupied, Hahn said, adding that the site has 
room for about 100 shops. Although the center once thrived, "there has never 
been 100% occupancy," Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several major tenants have departed in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogart's, the city's main venue for alternative rock music, closed last year. 
Houlihan's, a large restaurant and bar overlooking the marina, shut down in 
1992. Buffums, the mall's only department store, closed when the rest of the 
chain went out of business in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was already deteriorating when Buffums left," said Trent Esperti, who owns 
Barwinkles nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperti said Trident will make the mall work. "They are the first to promise 
new money, construction and anchor stores," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One longtime business owner said she is waiting for the mall to fulfill its 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been grossly mismanaged throughout the years," said Irene Pursch, 
owner of the Coffee Trader, an 18-year tenant on the mall's lower level. The 
previous managers and owners have failed to attract tourists and exploit the 
mall's beautiful view and location, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pursch said she hopes the developers will make room for her. The Coffee Trader 
is on a month-to-month lease. "I have hung on in hopes that someone would come 
in and do something with the place because it has always been a great place to 
be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer is betting on the lure of the more popular existing tenants plus 
well-known national retailers to revitalize the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retailing has changed in the last 10 years," Ellis said. "We would love to 
have some smaller tenants, but you need the major anchors to support the 
mom-and-pop places." 
</P>
<P>
 Trident also developed Beverly Connection across from the Beverly Center on La 
Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach city officials said they are excited about the Marina Pacifica 
development. The city helped mediate some of the negotiations between Trident 
and Bank of America but does not have a financial stake in the development 
beyond future sales tax revenue, said Susan F. Shick, the city's director of 
community redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition for business near the mall is plentiful. The Ralphs store will 
have to vie with a Lucky supermarket adjacent to the property. Another Ralphs 
market is in the Bixby Village Plaza about a mile away at Pacific Coast Highway 
and Bellflower Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ralphs feels that they can support another store in that area," said Ron 
Wood, a leasing agent with Santa Monica-based Epsteen & Associates, which is 
marketing Marina Pacifica for Trident. ". . . I know they agreed without 
hesitation." JOHN CANALIS

FOR SENIORS; LINDA FELDMAN; MOTHER, DAUGHTER LEARN TO TRUST EACH OTHER AGAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the problems of raising children is that they often turn out exactly as 
you wanted them. In Michel Jones' case, she was brought up to be creative, 
caring and fiercely independent. Her mother, Edith, just didn't know that one 
day those traits, from her perspective, would lead to a betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 And Michel didn't know how far she would go to get back her mother's trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel Jones was born in Toronto 40 years ago, the eldest of two siblings. Her 
father, Roy, died two years ago and her mother, Edith, stayed on in their 
spacious townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors never really sought to keep up with these Joneses. They were pretty 
much in a category by themselves. Edith, the gregarious one, was a drama 
teacher and an actress in the local community theater. Roy was an architect and 
an armchair philosopher. They belonged to House Church -- a multidenominational 
group made up of independent thinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Michel was 18, her parents gave her a train ticket to tour Canada. 
Instead, she cashed it in and hitchhiked across the country with a girlfriend. 
It proved to be an experience that would eventually come back at her. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want to tell me how to run my life but I found out later that 
they were in a constant state of torment, thinking of where I was and what I 
was doing," Michel, a film editor, said from her hillside house in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel remembers getting really close to her mother after those rebellious 
years. They enjoyed hiking together. Edith was always an active person. She 
walked three miles a day, maintained a heavy acting schedule all of her life, 
had the same circle of friends for close to 50 years and never complained about 
aches or pains even as she neared her 74th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a completely optimistic person. She swims, does yoga, participates in 
book clubs. I hope I'm like her when I'm her age," Michel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since her father died, though, Michel has felt protective of her mother 
-- a new feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 She had read that sometimes when one spouse dies, the other follows not too 
long afterward. So she was being watchful. But she was not at all prepared for 
what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother had a stroke while driving her car. She managed to get home but her 
brain couldn't figure out how to use the garage-door opener. She went to her 
neighbor's house and, because of her speech and walk, they thought she was 
drunk and left her at her house, where she collapsed and must have laid on the 
floor for at least a day before the police were called. It was awful and I 
remember thinking that she can't be alone any more," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel flew to Toronto. When she arrived at her mother's bedside, she saw 
someone who couldn't possibly be the woman who raised her -- she was so 
incapacitated she couldn't remember how to swallow. "I was grieving. I thought 
she died and what was left was a living, breathing corpse. She did recognize me 
but she couldn't speak," Michel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel began reading about strokes and the remarkable recoveries some people 
have made. Edith began to make progress, and Michel and her sister, Wendy, 
started looking at independent living arrangements -- without their mother's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to her with these suggestions, but we were hard-nosed. I said to her: 
'Mom, here are the facts. You can't live alone. You'll be in danger. I don't 
want to worry about you night and day.' I used a lot of 'have-to' phrases -- 
'You have to do this; you have to do that,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edith retaliated. She brought up how, even though it could have been 
dangerous, she had let Michel hitchhike because it was her life and she trusted 
her. Still, Michel felt responsible for her mother's well-being. Edith 
responded that she, too, was responsible for her own life. But Michel raised 
another issue: At what point does an older parent give over her independence? 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother stared at us dumbfounded. She said, 'It's my life and I'll decide 
when I go to a home, and it's not now. I have a right to live where I want. And 
if it's a choice between living in a home or living on my own I'll face those 
dangers.' 
</P>
<P>
 "She felt betrayed," Michel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel felt bad. She thought she was acting out of love and concern, following 
the advice of the doctors and nurses who suggested that she make the 
arrangements. A frost developed between them. 
</P>
<P>
 When Edith came to Brentwood to visit Michel six months later, things still 
weren't right between them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized I had to do something about getting rid of the anger, and we 
talked. I suggested we write a play together about it. We came up with a story 
and I wrote the play for her and her friends. It worked. It was the way to 
reach her. They have been rehearsing since June and the play ("The Afternoon 
Group") will be performed at the Richmond Hill Curtain Club in Toronto on Oct. 
2," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edith said from Toronto that she and her friends are having a lot of fun, 
although it's tough remembering their lines. They're going to do this, she 
said, even if it kills them. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel has taken it many steps further. She decided to do a documentary on the 
women who are acting in the play, asking them to discuss their fears and 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 She is filming the rehearsals as well as telling her own story along with her 
mother's. Most of the money is coming from her own pocket and she's counting on 
technicians to defer their fees. She's trying to raise $200,000. Everyone she 
talks to thinks it's a wonderful idea but no one wants to be first to give 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In her spare time, Michel volunteers for the Ken Edwards Center in Santa 
Monica to help elderly people manage their lives.

SUDDENLY SUNFLOWERS; NO LONGER RELEGATED TO THE ALLEY FENCE OR THE CORN ROW, IT 
SEEMS EVERYONE'S SPROUTING UPSUNFLOWERS IN SOUTHLAND GARDENS THESE DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sunflowers are sprouting everywhere. You can't help but see them on greeting 
cards, at florists, printed on trivets and bathroom towels, starring in 
television commercials, made into napkin rings and barrettes, and sometimes, 
you even see them in nice gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer are sunflowers relegated to the back 40, to lean their droopy heads 
against the alley fence or grow beside the corn. In today's garden, sunflowers 
have taken on a new dignity and position as ornamental flowers, to cut for the 
house or enjoy where they stand. 
</P>
<P>
 They certainly won't be found growing next to the corn in the Brentwood garden 
of Hilary Byk, but center stage, in decidedly formal beds with California Giant 
zinnias, outlined by neat boxwood hedges. They grow in the company of topiary 
giraffes and grandly trellised roses, where you might more expect to see 
perennials or at least tidy beds of squat marigolds or petunias. In these 
elegant surroundings, they're clearly not in Kansas anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunflowers are considered chic enough to grace expensive bouquets and are so 
popular at fashionable florists that Kathy Orlando, manager of Rita Flora on La 
Brea, a bright and airy floral shop that includes a little bistro, says they 
never have enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Seedsman Shepard Ogden of the Cook's Garden, whose catalogue probably offers 
the largest variety of sunflower seeds, says that sunflowers are now his 
top-seller. "They came from nowhere to become the best-selling flower in our 
catalogue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their catalogue lists a baker's dozen varieties, but only one will grow to 
make that huge head full of seeds that most people think of when sunflowers get 
mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are new ornamental varieties grown for their colorful flowers. They 
may be a velvety red, mahogany brown, golden yellow, burnt orange or a creamy 
yellow. There's even a new double-flowered variety (not yet available) that is 
calendula orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are spectacular combinations of these colors and most are seldom seen. A 
lot of gardeners don't even know they exist because they are not in many seed 
catalogues, or at many nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 These stunning new varieties of the old American favorite are coming from 
Europe, where interest in this native American flower has been greater because 
cut flowers are a bigger business. Some have even won Europe's coveted 
Fleuroselect award. Many of these colorful kinds also make seed, so you can 
have your cake and eat it too, if you can resist cutting them for the house. 
</P>
<P>
 And, nothing could be easier to grow. Or faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very fast," said Shirley Kerins, who included 15 kinds, all barely 
contained in their one gallon cans, at the last Huntington Botanical Gardens' 
plant sale. "Talk about Jack and the beanstalk. You can watch sunflowers grow." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve feet is not tall for a sunflower. In the Byk garden, the sunflowers 
grew quickly to that height until "it was like walking in a forest," says Byk. 
</P>
<P>
 There are smaller kinds. Some grow only a foot tall and are perfect in a pot, 
on a balcony railing or in the middle of a patio table. Some of these midgets 
have shown up as blooming plants at nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 The tall ones might be more fun to grow, especially for children. Children 
find the seed easy to handle and plant, and the sunflowers grow quicker than 
kids can lose interest and soon tower above them. When they're finished, 
children can eat the seed or feed the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The tall sunflowers are not hard to find room for because they are as skinny 
as they are tall. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscape architect Mike Swimmer grew a whole forest of them in Rancho Park 
(some appear in our bouquet on the cover), in a narrow little space between the 
driveway and his neighbor's fence. Most were grown for the birds, his birds, 
that live in a nearby aviary.  
</P>
<P>
 When the flowers are finished, he waits until the back of the sunflowers turn 
brown (which indicates that they are dry), then hangs the seed heads by their 
stems in the aviary and lets the birds fish out their own seed snacks. To save 
the seed for yourself do the same thing, but hang them in the garage until 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 He also likes the flowers, though many are up so high you can barely see them. 
"I fell in love with sunflowers after seeing 'Vincent and Theo,' " he says. 
There is one scene in that movie where Van Gogh is painting in a huge field of 
sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gogh might even be the inspiration for the sunflower craze. Rita Flora's 
Kathy Orlando is sure that everyone started wanting sunflower bouquets right 
after the exhibit of Van Gogh's later paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art in 1987. "It seems like it's been building since then." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Kerins has another reason or two why they sold over 300 sunflower 
plants at this year's sale (up from almost none the previous year). She thinks 
they're a symbol of a simpler life in the garden, a refreshing contrast to some 
of the sophisticated plants with long Latin names that we've been growing the 
last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a simple shape and so summery" she said. "People remarked that they 
hadn't seen one in years." She suspects a little nostalgia enters in. 
</P>
<P>
 But look how they've changed. Hardly any are plain old yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 One named Evening Sun, with flowers a half-foot across, is colored a deep 
mahogany with golden edges and a chocolate-brown center. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian White is at the other extreme -- small-flowered with creamy yellow 
rays surrounding a dark, purple-black center. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepard Ogden, of the Cook's Garden, explains that there are at least two 
distinct types of annual sunflowers out there (though there are some 110 
species known to grow in the Americas, including many perennials). 
</P>
<P>
 Evening Sun and others closely related to the seed sunflower look like that 
inhabitant of the vegetable garden. They make fat, sturdy stems, with big, 
thick, hairy leaves. Some produce but one huge flower, others may make up to a 
half dozen, and good-sized seeds are sure to follow flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian White and several others grow into lax, branching, soft-leaved plants 
with thinner stems but a profusion of smaller flowers. These make seed but 
there is not much of it and it is small and not what one thinks of as 
"sunflower seed." 
</P>
<P>
 Either kind can be any height, you'll have to trust the catalogue 
descriptions. While Evening Sun or the common Mammoth seed sunflower may grow 8 
to 12 feet tall, the similar Big Smile or Sunspot grow just a foot or two tall. 
"They remind me of babies," Kerins said. "Their big heads are all out of 
proportion to their bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 In various seed catalogues you can find all sorts of sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunbeam has a green eye in the center; Sunrise is a fashionable, pale 
lemon-yellow and Silverleaf more fashionable still with slightly silver, fuzzy 
foliage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunrich Lemon and Sunrich Orange have no pollen, so it doesn't get on your 
shirt or tablecloth (though it doesn't seem to stain). 
</P>
<P>
 Stella looks like a very tall black-eyed Susan, Music Box includes all sorts 
of colors on three-foot-tall plants and Prado Red is so dark that it's 
difficult to photograph. Prado is not available yet, nor is the 
calendula-colored Orange Queen, but look for them in next year's catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 There are even doubles that hardly look like sunflowers at all, such as Teddy 
Bear or Sole d'Oro, which look like suns gone supernova. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling over is harder than growing sunflowers. Even the birds can do it (and, 
in fact, plant many a sunflower). 
</P>
<P>
 They do need full sun, the hotter the better, but they'll grow in coastal 
gardens just fine. The cool and breezy Ocean View Farms community garden in Mar 
Vista is full of sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Any soil is OK, but in California, they need to be watered at least every 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 You can plant them as early as April, or as late as now, though you might be 
better off ordering catalogues now and planting next spring, especially inland. 
</P>
<P>
 From his several years of experience, Swimmer is sure that you could plant 
sunflowers at almost any time of the year in coastal Southern California, even 
though most are supposedly day-length sensitive, needing long summer days to 
make buds (a couple of new varieties are not, such as Sunrich Lemon or Sunrich 
Orange, which are day-neutral for the cut flower business).  
</P>
<P>
 Hilary Byk planted hers in April from seed, and the seed head ripened in late 
July. Some of the seed from that first crop fell to the ground and sprouted in 
August and she again had beds full of sunflowers in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want seed, be prepared for ugly plants. Once seed is set, plants yellow 
and wither quickly, but don't pull them out until the seed has time to ripen. 
Some varieties can be kept going a little longer if you cut off the flowers as 
they fade, and it's not likely you'll get any useful seed from these. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one possible problem. Sunflowers produce substances that inhibit the 
growth of other plants. They are "allelopathic" plants and have been known to 
control some weeds in their vicinity. No hard data or lists of affected plants 
exist, but if you notice that things planted at the base of sunflowers are 
struggling along, that might be the reason. 
</P>
<P>
 It only affects the immediate vicinity so you will probably notice nothing, 
but it might be a good idea to keep other annual plants at a slight distance. 
They certainly don't affect all plants since in many gardens sunflowers can be 
seen happily growing with many other flowers and vegetables. Several Seed 
Sources for Sunflowers 
</P>
<P>
 Though better nurseries have been quick to bring in sunflowers in color packs 
or already flowering in gallon cans (your best bet at this time of the year), 
these catalogue companies have the widest assortment of seed:

HOT PROPERTY: VILLA DEAL HAS ALL-STAR CAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pop superstar KENNY LOGGINS and his ex-wife, Eva, have sold their Santa 
Barbara home to actor JEFF BRIDGES and his wife, Susan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bridgeses, who put their Santa Monica home of 13 years on the market in 
May at $3.5 million, bought the Santa Barbara house, which had been listed at 
$8.5 million, for just under $7 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Loggins home was originally listed in September, 1990, at $14 million, 
after the couple had filed for divorce. They had built the nine-bedroom home in 
1988, after touring Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to look like a Tuscan villa, the gated estate has an 
8,500-square-foot main house, guest house, pool house, caretaker's cottage and 
sports complex. There are five kitchens, three laundry rooms and eight 
fireplaces in the home, which is on nearly 20 acres with a stream, pond, 
rock-grotto pool, two waterfalls, fountains, and ocean and mountain views. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grammy-winning Loggins, 46, was half of the 1970s pop-acoustic duo Loggins 
and Messina before he became a solo artist. The singer/songwriter has been 
working on new albums and touring since he got divorced and, in 1992, married 
nutritionist Julia Cooper. The couple had a child last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A father of four, Loggins, described in The Times' Calendar section as "one of 
many icons of the rock era to make a foray into family music," kicked off Sony 
Wonder's new Family Artists Series in May with his album "Return to Pooh 
Corner." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his new family are renting a house at the beach in Santa Barbara while 
a nearby home, which he bought for about $2 million, is being renovated. 
Loggins expects to move into that home, on about an acre, in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-time Academy Award nominee, Bridges, 44, just finished shooting the 
Western-adventure film "Wild Bill," in which he plays Wild Bill Hickok. Star of 
the summer action-thriller "Blown Away," he received a star on the Hollywood 
Walk of Fame last month. 
</P>
<P>
 He, his photographer wife and their three daughters are joining a number of 
celebrities in relocating from the Los Angeles area to Santa Barbara, prompting 
Montecito realtor Paul O'Keeffe to say, "We haven't seen prices like this since 
1989, our record year." 
</P>
<P>
 The home that the Bridgeses bought was listed by Penelope Williams of Rodeo 
Realty. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 FRED HAYMAN, who founded the Giorgio fashion and fragrance empire that he and 
his ex-wife sold to Avon in 1987 for $165 million, has put his two-acre 
compound at Point Dume on the market at nearly $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayman, who created the Fred Hayman Beverly Hills Fragrance Collections (273 
and Touch) and his "Fred Hayman" boutique in Beverly Hills since the Giorgio 
sale, decided to sell the two-acre Malibu site, because he built a house on a 
nearby bluff, and he has just moved there. 
</P>
<P>
 The home he listed has four bedrooms and separate guest quarters in about 
4,000 square feet plus an acre of park-like grounds, tennis court and ocean 
view. Terry O'Connor and Carol Rapf share the listing at Pritchett/Rapf & 
Associates, Malibu. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 ELIZABETH TAYLOR'S former Puerto Vallarta hacienda, known as Casa Kimberly, is 
for sale as a bed-and-breakfast at $1.4 million, including furnishings. The 
two-house compound was turned into a B&B after its current owners, Californians 
Frank and Toy Holstein, bought it from the actress in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor had owned the compound since the early 1960s. She and late actor 
Richard Burton, who were married in Puerto Vallarta, bought the two houses, 
across the street from each other, and joined them by a bridge, built to 
resemble the Bridge of Sighs in Venice, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22,000-square-foot compound has 10 bedrooms, 11 baths and 2 kitchens. It 
also has a 17-by-47-foot swimming pool and ocean views. Rooms rent for $45 to 
$125 a night. Cruise-line passengers can get a peek at $5 a person. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holsteins listed the property because they plan to retire, said listing 
agent Bill Greene of Century 21 Park in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist JOHN TAYLOR, co-founder in the late 1970s of the English pop-band 
Duran Duran, has leased a three-bedroom home in the Beverly Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, 34, and his wife, Amanda, rented the two-story, 3,500-square-foot 
house for a year at $4,500 a month, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The house had been listed for lease with Elaine Young and Paul Czako, both of 
Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate in Beverly Hills. Johanna Falduto of 
Stan Herman/Stephen Shapiro & Associates, Beverly Hills, represented the 
Taylors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TERRY SCHROEDER, captain of three U.S. Olympic water-polo teams and the model 
used by sculptor Robert Graham in creating a bronze male figure outside the 
L.A. Coliseum for the 1984 Games, has purchased a home at Sherwood Country 
Club, near Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder and his wife, Lori, both chiropractors, bought a four-bedroom home 
with mountain and lake views for nearly $625,000 through Tony Lennon, Sherwood 
director of sales and marketing who is a cousin of the singing Lennon Sisters.

GET LOWDOWN ON LOW-DOWN HOME BUYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 L ow-down, no-down are the four hottest words in real estate today, especially 
among cash-strapped first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 But finding the right home loan program for you can be a challenge. Some have 
geographic or income restrictions, others are just plain hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 However, help is on the way. If you're interested in no-down or low-down 
mortgages, make plans to attend the first Times' Low-Down Home Loan Expo. 
</P>
<P>
 The expo will be held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24, at the 
Burbank Hilton Convention Center, 2500 Hollywood Way, Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The expo is an all-day consumer education event where prospective home buyers 
can get the latest information on low-down and no-down mortgage programs, as 
well as government foreclosures and affordable home listings. 
</P>
<P>
 Three one-hour panel discussions will be presented in the morning, and then 
repeated in the afternoon. Experts will explain the programs in detail and 
answer your questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of private lenders also will be on hand to pre-qualify home buyers and 
explain down-payment programs as low as 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from federal and state government agencies such as FHA, the 
California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) and Cal-VET will explain their no- and 
low-down programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the City of Los Angeles Housing Department will lead a 
workshop on three municipal loan programs that help first-time buyers with 
low-down loans and lower monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Sessions will be offered on how home buyers can find federal government 
repossessed properties and private foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two biggest 
government-chartered buyers of mortgages on the secondary market, will explain 
a variety of new programs that help buyers get into the market with little 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Internal Revenue Service officials will be on hand to explain the 
Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) program, which helps buyers receive a direct 
income tax credit in selective communities. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the expo, call TimesLink at 808-8463 and press start 
9420 at the prompt.

CONDO Q & A: SBA EXTENDS DEADLINE FOR QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; She is a past president of the 
Greater Los Angeles chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), a 
national nonprofit research and educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: Our condominium association is still struggling with earthquake 
recovery. There are three different groups who cannot agree on the course of 
action and our board of directors has become totally ineffective. I am feeling 
frustrated, angry and powerless. 
</P>
<P>
 I have learned that the person who volunteered to file the loan application 
with the Small Business Administration (SBA) did not complete the paper work 
and now refuses to do it because we missed the filing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not convinced that the SBA could help us even if we had completed our 
application. We know of other associations in our area that still have not 
received approval for their loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Our association did not have earthquake insurance. If we can't get funding 
from SBA, I don't know how our association is going to function. Can we appeal 
to the SBA to accept a late application if our association can get its act 
together? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: I have good news for you and other people who have been dragging their 
feet. The SBA has once again extended the loan application deadline to Oct. 17. 
Rebecca Cooksey heads the SBA Outreach Department and she would be glad to 
assist your association. Her phone number is (818) 556-1554. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that there are still a lot of community associations that have been 
unable to deal with the decisions they need to make," Cooksey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The SBA is doing everything that we can to reach those associations and 
assist them by coming out to the associations and meeting with the board 
members and homeowners. Right now, we are meeting with about three associations 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA is already helping some 1,800 community associations at the present 
time. For those other associations that want to check on the status of their 
loan applications, the SBA number to call is (800) 488-5323. 
</P>
<P>
 If your association was dysfunctional before the quake, the crisis has 
magnified the problem. You are not the only association member who is 
frustrated and angry. Try to maintain hope and work to heal the divisive 
attitudes within your association so that you can start progressing toward the 
goal of making your association whole again. Please write to me again in a few 
weeks to let me know how your association is doing. Must Owner Pay for Quest's 
Damages 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I live in a planned unit development (PUD), which consists of 74 separate 
individual homes and a gated private road with retaining walls and tennis 
courts in the common area. 
</P>
<P>
 A visitor to my home accidentally backed into the retaining wall causing a 
small amount of damage. I informed my friend and the homeowner association so 
that they could resolve the problem. In the meantime, the association sent me a 
bill for the wall repair. 
</P>
<P>
 The association says that when I granted my friend's entrance to the complex, 
I became responsible for all of that person's actions. I refused to pay the 
bill because I refuse to acknowledge complete liability for my guest's 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Do I have any legal basis for my position? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm sorry to disappoint you, but if you read your association's governing 
documents you will probably find that a member of the association is 
responsible for the actions of himself or herself, as well as family members, 
guests, repair workers or any other person that you invite or allow into the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The association has the right and the authority to hold you responsible for 
the payment of damages. You are obligated to pay the bill, whether your friend 
reimburses you or not. I advise you to pay up or you will soon have late 
charges and attorney's fees added to your unpaid balance. 
</P>
<P>
 You may want to investigate obtaining liability insurance now that you are 
aware of your responsibility for your guests. Are Special Rules Only for 
Children Legal? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Our community association has some rules that apply to children under the 
age of 15. For instance, there are specific hours set aside when children can 
use the pool. We have occasionally been challenged as to the legality of these 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 What is your opinion of age restrictions? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your association should eliminate age restrictions other than those found 
in the local health and safety codes. Most attorneys who counsel community 
associations are making sure that their association clients are aware of the 
federal Fair Housing Amendments Act, which prohibits age discrimination in 
housing. Many parents feel that their children have the right to full enjoyment 
of the use of the association amenities, regardless of their age. 
</P>
<P>
 I recommend that associations restrict unwanted behavior rather than 
restricting children. For example, if you don't want noise or toys in and 
around the pool area, then restrict the noise and toys but don't make rules 
that are age-specific. A rule that states, "Running in the pool area is 
prohibited" is better than "Children are not allowed to run in the pool area." 
Obviously, to prevent injury, no one should run in the pool area regardless of 
their age, so eliminate the reference to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Research the local health and safety codes and consult with your association's 
attorney if you have specific questions about the legality of your rules. 
Management Firm Hides Their Address 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Our homeowner association is managed by a management company that closed 
their office and obtained a post office box so that most of their business is 
conducted by mail. Even the board members do not know the location of the 
manager's office or the whereabouts of our association records. Our phone calls 
are taken by a recorder and many calls are not answered. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems peculiar that the company does not want their business address known. 
The board of directors is sympathetic to our complaints but they haven't 
changed management companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't the company obligated to provide the services that we need? What can we 
do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Reputable management companies have a business address and they answer 
phone calls promptly. If the contract does not specify that they must have a 
business office that is accessible to the members, then they may not be 
required to provide one. However, the association's board of directors should 
know the location of their records and they should be cautious about a company 
that is, in effect, going into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers have disappeared without notice and taken association funds with 
them. The board should be diligent about obtaining a business address. If the 
company is failing to operate in a professional manner, the board should 
probably seek a new company. 
</P>
<P>
 As owners, you can attend a board meeting or write to the board to let them 
know that you are concerned about the current management company's performance. 
If the board fails to respond, you can petition the board to hold a special 
meeting of the owners to discuss the matter. Consult your association's bylaws 
about the method of calling for a special meeting.

YOUR MORTGAGE; 'GARBAGE,' 'JUNK' FEES SPUR CONSUMER LAWSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're called "garbage fees" and "junk charges" inside the mortgage industry, 
and they're the focus of a fast-moving wave of class-action suits on behalf of 
home buyers and re-financers. 
</P>
<P>
 They've also triggered demands that the federal government toughen up 
"truth-in-lending" rules to protect borrowers nationwide from being hit with 
unexpected, undisclosed fees at settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consumer, you ought to know about them, so here's a quick overview. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve Board was asked to draw up new 
regulations that effectively ban the imposition of last-minute junk charges in 
home mortgage transactions. What are these fees? In the words of Chicago 
attorney Daniel A. Edelman, they carry a wide range of creative terminology on 
settlement sheets, including "underwriting" fees, loan disbursement charges, 
tax service fees, amortization schedule charges, truth-in-lending disclosure 
preparation fees, processing fees, loan assignment fees, flood-plain 
determination fees, document transportation or courier fees, to name just a 
handful. 
</P>
<P>
 Their common thread, says Edelman, is that they should be included in the 
federally mandated "finance charge" computation provided to borrowers three 
days after application, but in fact are not disclosed until settlement. The 
finance charge covers all the interest and other attendant costs or fees that 
are necessary to obtain the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, whose firm has filed several class-action suits against mortgage 
lenders in the Midwest and South, says the use of junk charges has grown 
sharply in recent years so that some lenders "can appear to offer more 
competitive (annual percentage) rates (APRs)" to potential applicants by not 
disclosing all the fees they plan to charge at closing. One side effect of this 
practice, Edelman says, is "to shift overhead costs (some real, some fictitious 
and representing pure profit to the lender) onto borrowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though certain of the fees seem relatively small -- typically ranging 
from $30 to $250 -- they can amount to substantial aggregate sums on the annual 
bottom line for lending institutions. Whatever the dollar size of the garbage 
charges, Edelman argues, "they violate federal law." Under the Truth-in-Lending 
Act they are supposed to be included in the "finance charge" advance 
disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent court decisions around the country appear to lend support to Edelman's 
position. According to a memorandum sent to clients by Brownstein Zeidman & 
Lore, a Washington law firm that represents large numbers of banks and mortgage 
companies, a federal appeals court ruling in a Florida case this spring held 
that courier charges and a state "intangibles tax" are indeed "finance charges" 
under the Truth-in-Lending Act when they're passed onto borrowers at 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorandum warned that eight class-action suits on behalf of borrowers had 
been filed in the past several weeks alone, and urged clients to "review 
carefully (your Truth-in-Lending) compliance procedures, forms and closing 
instruments to ensure . . . that (your) charges are properly characterized." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, a federal court decision this year cited by Edelman in Maryland 
held that a $290 "origination fee" that was excluded from the finance charge 
violated the Truth-in-Lending Act. In a Pennsylvania case, a lender was found 
by a federal court to have violated the law by "marking up" document recording 
fees and imposing a charge for preparing Truth-in-Lending disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for comment about junk fees, executives of several large mortgage firms 
had contrasting responses. For example, David Hershman, a regional vice 
president for American Residential Mortgage Corp. in northern Virginia, 
expressed surprise that such fees were being excluded from finance charge 
disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought everybody understood that you have to include (routine 
financing-related fees) as part of the Truth-in-Lending disclosure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But another lender who spoke only on the condition of anonymity put it 
differently: "Of course some people out there are doing it (padding on junk 
fees at settlement). But it stinks in my opinion. You can't hand the borrower a 
fait accompli at settlement: You gotta pay these extra charges, chump, or you 
don't get the loan." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve Board confirmed that staff members in 
the consumer affairs division are reviewing the subject of junk fees, prompted 
by a set of proposals for rule clarification submitted by Edelman. No decisions 
have been reached yet, however, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the bottom line of all this for you? 
</P>
<P>
 Be aware that garbage fee practices exist, and may in some cases constitute 
violations of federal law. Ask your lender at application what fees typically 
are included in the finance charge computation, and what fees may be charged 
separately at closing.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST: GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Prepare the garden for winter vegetables by removing all spent summer 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 * For larger blooms from chrysanthemums this fall, dis-bud them now. Also 
stake and tie the plants to prevent drooping and breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant early flowering sweet peas for an abundance of flowers during the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treat Walnut husk fly with applications of Malathion and spreader sticker.

GARDENING Q&A: GARDENING; DROPPED FRUIT IS NORMAL FOR MOST CITRUS TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK E. CHRISTENSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I have dwarf orange and grapefruit trees that are about 3 years old. 
About the time when fruit sets on, it all falls off, especially the oranges. 
Can you tell me what's wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: It is normal for citrus trees, especially orange trees, to take one to 
seven years to start fruiting properly. Since your trees are only 3 years old, 
chances are you have nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 The UC Cooperative Extension Service says that even mature citrus trees 
normally drop a fairly high proportion of the fruit they set, and that it is 
nature's way for the trees to balance themselves. Their research and experience 
show that excessive or abnormal fruit drop can be kept to a minimum by watering 
the trees carefully, avoiding excessive pruning, and keeping pests under 
control. If you're OK in these concerns, all your trees need is time, the 
hardest treatment of all. What Soil Best Suits Azaleas and Camellias? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Considering the water situation here in Southern California, what is the 
best soil for planting camellias and azaleas? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Azaleas are not drought tolerant: they need a constant supply of moisture 
and air in their root zone. Hence, in our climate I would recommend planting 
azaleas in leaf mold in a shady garden spot that gets plenty of water. 
Camellias thrive in the same conditions, but established plants that are 
vigorous and more than 3 years old can survive adequately almost on natural 
rainfall. When planting camellias, be sure to keep the top of the root ball at 
or slightly above ground level. Camellia roots suffocate, and the plants will 
eventually die, if situated any deeper. What Kind of Grass Grows Well in Shade? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am at my wit's end with my back yard. It's a heavily shaded area with a 
large liquidambar tree and other dense shrubbery shutting out most of the 
sunlight. I've tried dichondra and plugged in St. Augustine grass several 
times, but even they refuse to take hold and spread. Do you know of any grass 
that prefers shade and would resolve my problem? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I spoke with several turf growers who were surprised that the St. Augustine 
would not grow. Usually this grass will readily take root and grow, even in 
shady conditions. This leads to a few questions. Perhaps the soil in this area 
is hard and compacted. Was it rototilled or loosened (then smoothed) prior to 
planting? Was the soil moist to several inches below the surface at planting 
time? Were the plugs watered at least twice a day after planting, so they could 
take root? If you answered "no" to any of these questions, that is probably the 
problem that needs to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 But if your answers were all "yes," your problem will require other solutions. 
For instance, after loosening the soil and leveling it, you could plant one of 
the several available brands of "shade blend" grass seed; and you may need to 
replant on an annual basis every fall, but this could give a satisfactory lawn. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Or if this is an area that will only receive occasional light foot traffic, 
you might consider planting an attractive, low-growing, shade-tolerant ground 
cover as a lawn substitute. Possible selections include: 
</P>
<P>
 Herniaria glabra, also called "Green Carpet" -- a trailing plant with dense, 
tiny, bright green leaves; it spreads well but won't grow out of control; 
foliage turns bronze-red in cold winters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lysimachia nummularia, "Moneywort" or "Creeping Jennie" -- evergreen creeping 
plant with long runners that root at joints. Forms pretty light green mat of 
roundish leaves; needs considerable moisture to be at its best. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentilla verna, "Spring Cinquefoil" -- Bright green tufted creeper 2"-6" 
high; yellow flowers; resembles tiny strawberry plants without fruits. 
</P>
<P>
 But if your back yard is a play area or is used a lot for entertaining, you 
might also want to consider putting in flagstones or other pavers with one of 
the above-mentioned ground-covers planted between them. Can Crape Myrtle Blooms 
Be Prolonged? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My Crape Myrtles are in full bloom right now and are gorgeous, but the 
blooms only seem to last for a few weeks. Is there anything I can do to prolong 
their beauty? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Crape Myrtles are especially beautiful in our Southern California climate, 
where some begin blooming in July and others bloom through September. I have 
read that pruning back the old flower clusters as soon as the blooms lose their 
appeal encourages the plants to re-bloom in a few weeks; otherwise, they put 
their energy into forming seed capsules. It sounds reasonable to me, and I 
think this is definitely an idea worth trying.

GREEN THUMB; PEPPER SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH CARTER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Carter cautiously tends a small garden 
in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last spring, I had a vision of red, green and yellow bell peppers in an 
elegant, restaurant-like creation. The peppers were stunning, sliced into 
strips, lightly sauted with pea pods and baby carrots arranged on a white china 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing there in the Pasadena farmer's market, I knew I could buy a few 
plants and grow this rainbow of vegetables in my garden. The tags sticking out 
of plastic pots read Yolo Wonder Pepper, Sweet Banana Pepper and Red Bell 
Pepper. I bought one of each. No need to go overboard on this first attempt at 
living color cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Brimming with confidence, I planted, watered and waited. The plants 
flourished. Sets of rich green leaves covered the branches. In no time, the 
white blossoms set and the fruit started to form. 
</P>
<P>
 On two of the plants, the waxy green lumps took shape. They'd be fist-sized in 
a few months. I'd snap them from the plant and rush to the kitchen. Within 
minutes, the colorful peppers would be part of a marinated salad or a 
stir-fried meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The third plant, however, seemed to take a detour. Instead of a compact plant 
with large leaves, it got leggy and sprawled. The leaves were healthy but 
small. To my relief the strange-looking plant produced a profusion of blossoms 
and the fruit began to develop on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 But I didn't see how any of the dozens of small fruit on this plant would ever 
look like the Yellow Sweet Banana Pepper pictured on the tag. In fact, they had 
a decidedly reddish tinge. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Yolo" and "Red" pepper plants, by contrast, flourished. Their branches 
sagged under the weight of a maturing crop of peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 But my colorful culinary vision was not to be, as I came to realize after 
several months of careful gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I had a crop of peppers all right. Two plants yielded fleshy green bell 
peppers, twins of those found piled in produce bins in every grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 And my renegade plant displayed an abundance of small flamed fruit whose shape 
and color said, "Proceed with Caution." 
</P>
<P>
 And I did. One morning I picked a single ripe pepper from the nonconforming 
plant. At the sink in the kitchen, I hesitated before biting into it. Instead, 
I cut a piece of flesh from it about the size of a sesame seed. With care, I 
placed the tiny red chunk in my mouth to sample this mysterious harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 In seconds, my mouth went painfully numb. My tongue and the inside of my lip 
had been zapped by Luke Skywalker's light saber. In no way similar to tasting 
salsa laced with jalapeno peppers, this sensation resembled a savage attack by 
a chemical agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few hours, the cells and taste buds returned to normal. No permanent 
damage, thank goodness. I did, however, look in the mirror and notice a red 
streak stretching from the edge of my upper lip to my left nostril on the 
skin's surface. Something from the pepper's chemistry had migrated from the 
inside of my lip through to the exterior of my face. What if I'd chomped down 
on a handful of the little devils? 
</P>
<P>
 All through the growing season, the plant obeyed the Old Testament command "to 
be fruitful and multiply." It produced crop after crop of its little sticks of 
dynamite. I lost count after the total hit a hundred. Little bags of peppers 
went home with family, friends, friends of friends -- anyone who would take 
them. Each bag was marked with a sticker reading, "Extremely Hot. Consume at 
Your Own Risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Long after the rest of the plants from my summer garden exhausted themselves 
and had been tossed on the compost pile, the fiery pepper kept on going, like 
the Energizer Rabbit. After weeks of cold rainy weather in the middle of 
winter, the tenacious plant clung to life. Two or three red peppers dangled 
from its bare branches, their heat warming the plant and keeping the frost at 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
 I've given up my dreams of Technicolor peppers and I'll never again believe 
the labels on plants. This year I just closed my eyes, picked up a dozen or so 
plants at random and stuck them in the ground without looking at the labels.

HANDYMAN Q&A: WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN SELECTING RANGE HOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: We've been looking at kitchen range hoods, and aside from styling 
and some features, such as lighting and number of fan speeds, almost all the 
models seem very similar. Are there real differences between range hoods, and 
if so, what should we be looking for? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The only real difference between one range hood and another is the way 
it deals with the stale air it captures. Some hoods filter out the moisture and 
grease before returning the freshened air to the room. Other machines dump 
stale air outside through a duct in the wall, just like a conventional 
wall-mounted exhaust fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the air is actually changed, extraction is the more efficient method, 
but it is necessary to cut a hole through the wall and, of course, the heated 
air is lost -- excellent in hot weather but rather a waste in winter. Range 
hoods that recycle the air are much simpler to install but never filter out all 
the grease and odors, even when new. It is essential to clean and change the 
filters regularly to keep the hood working at peak efficiency. How to Dispose 
of Asbestos Shingles 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We own a 1950s-era house that has asbestos shingles on the sides and back 
and vinyl siding on the front. The shingles are in good condition, but we are 
concerned that they would be a factor in selling our home. If the shingles are 
removed, will their disposal be difficult? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although the shingles are referred to as asbestos, they are really asbestos 
cement shingles. That is, the asbestos fibers are encapsulated in cement. As 
long as the shingles are in good condition there is no problem. However, if 
they are abraded or sawn, asbestos fibers can be released. 
</P>
<P>
 If these shingles are in good condition, they are generally not a factor when 
the home is sold. Nevertheless, there will always be buyers who will try to 
make the shingles a part of the sales negotiation. Even if the shingles are in 
poor condition, they don't have to be removed. You can install new siding over 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing the shingles is expensive, since the work must be done by a licensed 
asbestos removal contractor. The waste will have to be disposed of in a 
landfill designed to take this material. How to Stop Dark Lines on Ceiling 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There are dark lines on the drywall ceiling below the attic in my house. 
The lines coincide with the ceiling joists. Someone suggested it is due to the 
lack of insulation. However, we have 6-inch batts in the attic. Do you have a 
cure for this problem? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although you have insulation between the joists in the attic floor, the top 
of the joists are exposed to the cold winter temperature in the attic. Since 
the wood joists are not effective insulators, they act as thermal bridges. 
Consequently, the temperature at the underside of the joists (at the drywall 
ceiling) is cooler than the adjacent sections of the ceiling, which are covered 
with the insulation batts. Because of the lower temperature below the joists, 
condensation (however slight) tends to form along those areas. Over time, the 
moisture traps dust and also results in mildew growth, which shows up as shadow 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent this from recurring, first paint the ceiling. Use a paint 
containing mildewcide. Next, install insulation batts over the exposed ceiling 
joists. Ideally, the insulation should fill the spaces between the joists and 
cover the top of the joists as well. This last layer of batts is often 
installed perpendicular to the floor joists. 
</P>
<P>
 However you install the insulation, make sure to use a type that does not have 
a foil or kraft paper vapor barrier. And be sure additional insulation does not 
cover soffit vents or recessed light housings (unless the housings are IC types 
rated for direct contact with insulation). How to Repair Mortar Joints in Brick 
Walls 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The mortar joints on the brick walls of my house are dried and crumbling. 
How can I repair this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The repair procedure for mortar joints on brick is known as "tuck 
pointing." Start by chipping out all the loose mortar from the joints with a 
cold chisel and hammer to a depth of at least 1 inch. Clean away dust and chips 
with a water jet and wire brush. In areas where failing water is causing mortar 
leaks, remove the bricks and clean mortar from remaining bricks in the 
surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix mortar from one part portland cement, one-half part hydrated lime, 4 1/2 
parts sand and enough water so that the mixture can be compacted into a ball. 
Let it stand for one hour, then add enough water to make a stiff but workable 
paste. Dampen joints with clean water. Use a jointing tool to force the mortar 
into joints. As you compress the mortar and strike off the joints with the 
jointing tool, work in one direction only to avoid forming air pockets.

REAL ANSWERS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: How do I negotiate a price below the list price? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Most real estate experts encourage buyers to learn about the seller's 
motivation so they can obtain the best deal possible. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a lower price with a speedy escrow may be more acceptable to 
someone who must move quickly due to a job transfer. People going through a 
divorce or eager to move into another home frequently are more receptive to 
lower offers. 
</P>
<P>
 A seller's advertised price should be treated as a rough estimate of what they 
would like to receive, according to Ralph Warner, Ira Serkes and George Devine 
in their book, "How to Buy a House in California," (Nolo Press, Berkeley: 
1994). 
</P>
<P>
 "Different sellers price houses very differently. Some deliberately overprice, 
others ask for pretty close to what they hope to get and a few (maybe the 
cleverest) underprice their houses in the hope that potential buyers will 
compete and overbid. "In considering the list price of a house you're serious 
about, take the time to learn about the seller's personality," the authors 
write. 
</P>
<P>
 Before making an offer, also investigate how much comparable homes have sold 
for in the area so that you can determine whether the home is priced right.

 QUESTION: Does it make sense to replace my 10-year-old central air 
conditioner, even though it still runs, with a new super-efficient one? What is 
new with super-efficient air conditioners for 1994? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Replacing your old central air conditioner with a new efficient unit 
can lower your cooling costs by 30% to 40%. The newest designs for 1994 are 
also quieter and more reliable. The long-term payback often justifies replacing 
an old inefficient unit that still runs.

 The most recent innovations in central air conditioners are two-speed and 
totally-variable-speed compressors and blowers. These continually fine tune the 
cooling output to match the varying cooling needs of your house throughout the 
day and night. 
</P>
<P>
 On all but the hottest days, the compressor runs at a slow efficient speed. 
This reduces the amount of electricity consumed. When the cooling needs 
increase on a very hot day, it automatically shifts to higher speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 By coupling a variable-speed compressor with a new variable-speed indoor 
blower, comfort is improved. The compressor runs longer at the efficient slower 
speed and needs to cycle on and off less often. 
</P>
<P>
 This maintains a steady indoor temperature. If you have allergies and use a 
central air cleaner, it will be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The most efficient single-speed air conditioners use scroll compressors. 
Scroll compressors have fewer moving parts than standard reciprocating piston 
compressors. Without the pistons and hardware, scroll compressors are much 
quieter. 
</P>
<P>
 As scroll compressors wear over years of operation, they seal better and 
operate smoother than when they were new. The basic design is reliable and they 
should continue to operate at high efficiency levels for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 One new efficient model, made by Aqua Cal, uses a triangular plastic outdoor 
housing with smooth contoured edges. There are no dangerous sharp corners for 
children to crash into. The plastic housing never rusts. 
</P>
<P>
 Use SEER (seasonal energy efficiency ratio) ratings to compare the overall 
operating efficiency of various models. Also consider the type of compressor 
and number of speeds, which affect comfort and noise level. 
</P>
<P>
 Always do a payback analysis before selecting an air conditioner. Consider 
both SEER ratings and comfort factors. For most climates, a variable-speed 
model provides a good compromise. Its special blower is also needed if you plan 
to install a new efficient variable-speed gas furnace too. 
</P>
<P>
 Write for Utility Bills Update No. 937 showing a buyer's guide of 20 
super-efficient central air conditioners, SEER efficiency ratings, cooling 
output capacities, compressor types and speeds, and an annual savings/payback 
chart. Please include $2 and a self-addressed envelope to James Dulley, Los 
Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. Does Oscillating 
Fan Use More Electricity? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I just bought an oscillating pedestal fan with three speeds. Does it use 
more electricity when it oscillates? 
</P>
<P>
 A: An oscillating fan is an energy-efficient choice among various fan designs. 
A small oscillating fan produces the same cooling effect as a larger 
non-oscillating fan. With a smaller motor, a small fan uses less electricity. 
The oscillating feature does not require a separate motor. The slow rotation is 
driven by the same motor that spins the fan blades. The additional amount of 
electricity used to oscillate the fan is negligible.

 The Wulfs ("The Evolution of Getting Escrewed" by Carrie Wulf, July 31) must 
be spoiled brats. We just sold our house and bought another one and are 
extremely grateful for all the hard work that our real estate agent and escrow 
company put into making our dream happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Wulf, why did you accept an offer at a $55,000 loss? No one forced you to 
take that offer just two weeks after your house went on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Who forced you to use an agent? Without a real estate agent, how would anyone 
know about your house being on the market? Multiple listings ensure that all 
agents know about your listing. Real Estate agents work very hard; ours had 
open houses every weekend until our house sold. I never realized how much work 
went into selling a home. She earned every penny of her commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it was a pain filling out all of the paperwork. But again, whenever we 
had questions, we called our agent or escrow officer; everyone was more than 
eager to help us. We also pre-qualified for a loan, thus completing much of the 
paperwork ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me, Ms. Wulf, do you have time to process all the paperwork, do it 
correctly and on time? Surely you don't expect appraisers, pest control 
workers, title companies, etc., to do their jobs for free. You must live in a 
dream world and have no idea how much paperwork is involved in "real life." 
</P>
<P>
 You were very fortunate to sell your house and find another one quickly. 
You've gone through the experience before and should have known what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no sympathy for malcontents such as you two who are obviously entitled 
to more than the rest of us. Next time sell your house on your own. 
</P>

<P>
 Carrie Wulf's shortsightedness and naivete caused her to write a lamentation 
that does great disservice to thousands of hard-working and knowledgeable 
professionals in all phases of the real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Her complaints are particularly hollow in that her transactions were 
completely optional. Anyone who sells their home in a buyer's market just 
because they "get an itch to" shouldn't be surprised to take a loss.  
</P>
<P>
 They then complain that their broker made a commission. A professional realtor 
receives no salary or wage for just showing up each day. A realtor must invest 
considerable time and expense to get licensed, maintain Board of Realtors and 
MLS membership, attend continuing education courses, maintain market awareness 
through review and caravans, negotiate the transaction, and then coordinate 
title, escrow, lending, property inspection, termite work and hand hold their 
client before they earn a dime and then only at the close of a successful 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer then complains about the fact that she had to pay for her loan, 
escrow and closing costs. Yes, it does cost money to borrow money. Always has, 
always will. Yes, it does cost money to process all the paperwork required to 
transfer real estate legally from one party to another. 
</P>
<P>
 However, all of that work and expense is required to meet the countless 
federal, state and local rules and regulations that have primarily been put in 
place so that everyone in the transaction is treated fairly and everyone gets 
exactly what they bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
 This last concept is the most important of all. These people listed their 
house with a professional agent and got an agreeable price within two weeks, 
they bought another home with the help of this same agent, again at a price 
they agreed to, then applied for and received a new loan under terms and 
conditions they agreed to. She admitted that they received quick and efficient 
escrow and closing service. In summary, they got exactly what they bargained 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 Had they not wanted to undertake these expenses, they could have stayed in the 
"single family dump" (her words) in which they were living. 
</P>
<P>
 Her only complaint seems to be that they had to actually pay for the 
professional services that they bargained for and received. 
</P>
<P>
 Times readers interested in real estate issues would be much better served by 
articles explaining the complexities of the real estate transactional process. 
Ignorant whinings by an obvious cheapskate are of little value.

 It is easy to understand the Wulfs' frustration in the sale of their home and 
the purchase of another. It can be, to many, a frightening venture. The 
simplest transaction would be for cash and, if the parties were prepared to 
complete it as soon as possible, it could be done in 24 hours. This without the 
interference of the lender, title company, termite man, homeowners 
associations, appraiser and the list can get even larger. Each one contributes 
to the confusion and cost, all ending up in that place called "escrow." 
</P>
<P>
 We in the escrow business don't seek out all of this outside intervention -- 
the sellers and buyers instruct us to and tell us further that we cannot 
complete the transaction unless all of these entities have delivered to the 
escrow the results of their labor. Naturally there is going to be a billing 
enclosed, which again we are instructed to pay on behalf of our principals, the 
buyer and seller. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope that your next sale and purchase will be a more enjoyable with what 
you have learned, but please remember the decision is yours. Escrow has little 
to do but carry out your instructions and it's not our intention to see you 
"escrewed."

 Thank you, Carrie Wulf, for writing "The Evolution of Getting Escrewed. . . ." 
I agree on everything you wrote. The only thing you left out was a solution to 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 I consider myself a professional real estate agent in its purest sense. The 
term professional is a misnomer when used in real estate. I base this on 
observing the majority of agents in today's market. Our industry leaders and 
managers, as well as the agents themselves, really believe they are 
professional. The only ones being fooled are themselves. It is obvious that the 
general public regards us as fools, greedy, self-centered, uncaring, but 
definitely not professional. 
</P>
<P>
 We call ourselves professional but our actions prove us wrong. Low standards 
of commitment, selfish personal goals, reluctance or inability to accept 
change, no or little self-esteem, and many more negative behaviors are conduct 
the public witness and experience everyday!

 As a member of the East Orange County Assn. of Realtors, Carrie Wulf's 
comments, in the main, infuriated me. 
</P>
<P>
 Wulf says she "lost" $55,000. Was this an actual loss or a paper loss (based 
on sales prices five or six years ago)? If they actually sustained a cash loss 
over what they paid for their property and they could still afford to buy 
another home, then they are more fortunate than most young couples. 
</P>
<P>
 They sold their home in two weeks and she's complaining? In this market? This 
tells me that her realtor did his job well. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Realtors reports that on average realtors work a minimum 
of 60 hours per week and earn $35,000 a year. Agents are independent 
contractors and receive no benefits (health insurance, vacation, sick leave, 
etc.) When tax time rolls around we pay Social Security payments of 15% before 
we pay income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that should Wulf get the itch to sell her home in the future she 
should definitely do it herself. 
</P>

 I am appalled at Wulf's ignorance. She presented such an inaccurate picture of 
the real estate industry. If she was trying to be funny, she wasn't; she was 
insulting to all of those businesses that are associated with the real estate 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 For her to criticize various entities involved in her sale and purchase over 
their fees is inappropriate. If she wanted an "estimated" closing statement, 
all she needed to do was ask. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, she doesn't pay a 6% commission to her salesperson when 
purchasing a Liz Claiborne pastel suit -- the store has already marked up the 
price by 50%! Come on, Wulf, let's get with the program.

 It's amazing that in this day and age how naive, myopic, irresponsible and 
self-centered some people can be. 
</P>
<P>
 I trust that Wulf and her husband have jobs and receive compensation for their 
efforts. Realtors on the other hand get paid only when a home is closed. Ours 
is one of the few professions in which a service is rendered over and over 
again without a penny of compensation up front and no guarantee of any at any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 We learn lessons from past experiences, Ms. Wulf. I hope that the next time 
you sell a home you do it yourself. In the meantime I wish you would refrain 
from making such reckless generalizations about an industry which you know so 
little about.

 I would like Susan Olenick to know that at least one other reader shared her 
views upon seeing the now-infamous "Best Shot" of the painted elephant 
(Letters, July 17). While painting ceremonial elephants certainly does not rank 
with their atrocious treatment in zoos and circuses, it strips them of their 
dignity and enforces the view that animals are at our disposal. It is somewhat 
chilling to note how many readers felt they must defend the questionable 
practices of other cultures, and attack a reader guilty only of a humane bent!

WHY VIETNAM-ERA 'DOVES' WANT TO INVADE HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Clough, Michael Clough is a senior fellow at the Council of Foreign 
Relations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The debate over U.S. policy toward Haiti is heavily laden with historical 
irony. Like most liberals who came of age during the Vietnam era, National 
Security Adviser W. An thony Lake, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and 
most other senior officials in the Clinton Administration who favor an invasion 
were vehement opponents of military intervention in the Third World. And, if 
the Administration does send in the Marines, its harshest critics will include 
many Republicans who ardently backed the U.S. role in Vietnam, as well as the 
more recent interventions in Grenada and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a contemporary irony. The potentially divisive effects of the 
exodus of Haitians -- and now Cubans -- on domestic politics are increasingly 
driving foreign policy, a development that Lake and Talbott would surely 
resist. Yet, the political anxieties have given added weight to their solution 
-- invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake and Talbott are both heirs of the Wilsonian tradition of liberal 
internationalism and grandsons of the generation of "wise men" -- such as John 
J. McCloy, Dean Acheson and W. Averill Harriman -- who guided the United 
States, in the 1940s, into the uncharted seas of world leadership. But both 
rebelled against their elders over the Vietnam War: Lake as a Foreign Service 
officer serving on the staff of then-National Security Adviser Henry A. 
Kissinger, and Talbott as a student at Yale and Oxford, where he roomed with 
young Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 In opposing the war, neither Lake nor Talbott rejected the idea that the 
United States had a unique responsibility to lead the world. Quite the 
contrary. Their opposition flowed from a belief that Washington was betraying 
national values and undermining the country's ability to lead when it subverted 
governments and aided corrupt dictators. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives, by contrast, were never much interested in questions of 
morality and global responsibility. They saw military intervention in Vietnam 
as a legitimate exercise of national sovereignty. For them, the overriding 
issue was always "American" interests and the threat to them posed by 
communism. They were internationalists out of necessity, not conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be unfair, then, to chastise the Administration's "hawk" converts on 
Haiti. For Lake, Talbott and other neo-Wilsonians, the end of the Cold War 
frees the United States to return to its task of making the world safe for 
democracy. Geopolitics no longer forces us to intervene on the "wrong" side in 
Third World struggles. Instead, we can use power to promote change in places 
like Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a more subtle dimension to the role reversals. During the past 
two decades, liberals who opposed the Vietnam War, and interventionism in 
general, were politically mauled by neo-conservatives for their reputed 
unwillingness to stand up to communism and use force. Lake and many other 
Administration officials still bear the scars of those political attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes in Haiti are thus doubly high for the Administration's liberal 
internationalists. In their judgment, a failure to stand up to the Haitian 
thugs would undermine America's ability to promote democracy and reinforce 
Republican charges that Democrats are not tough enough to conduct an effective 
foreign policy. But they may be trapped in a no-win situation. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a possibility that an invasion could be carried out successfully with 
a minimum of casualties. But the post-invasion challenge of transforming Haiti 
into a viable democracy would be immense. At a minimum, it would require a 
tremendous infusion of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even under the best possible circumstances, it is highly doubtful that a U.S. 
invasion would be popular at home. Americans almost certainly share the 
conservatives' doubts that U.S. interests are engaged in Haiti. A strong case 
could be made that taxpayer dollars would be squandered to appease the 
Congressional Black Caucus and protect the Administration's political interests 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 If an invasion proved difficult and costly, and American lives were lost, the 
consequences would be calamitous. The perception that Bill Clinton and Talbott, 
who sat out the Vietnam War at Yale and Oxford, were putting the lives of U.S. 
soldiers at risk for dubious reasons would be political dynamite certain to be 
detonated by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration would thus be wise to step back from the brink. Clinton 
should convert the crisis in Haiti into an opportunity to level with the 
American people and begin to develop policies that will allow us to end the 
self-defeating battle between liberal internationalism and conservative 
nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 A first step would be to outline why U.S. military intervention is a flawed 
strategy. The President could cite the legacy of past interventions, almost all 
of which failed to produce either democracy or economic development. He could 
also applaud the wisdom of American skepticism toward international crusades. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, he could emphasize the paucity of quick or cost-free fixes to the 
problems of dictatorship and underdevelopment in countries like Haiti. Money 
spent on a military operation, the President might contend, would be better 
used to prevent future Haitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, Clinton should initiate a comprehensive review of sanctions. 
Paradoxically, the suffering of Haiti's ordinary citizens caused by current 
sanction policy is putting more pressure on the United States to go in than on 
the junta to get out. We should thus consider ending general economic sanctions 
but strengthen measures aimed at freezing the foreign assets of Haitian elites 
and restricting travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, the President should make it clear that the principal responsibility 
for removing the thugs in Port-au-Prince rests with the Haitian people. The 
United States would be prepared to assist them in the same way that the French 
assisted us during our revolution and the Reagan Administration aided rebels in 
Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia and Nicaragua. Such a threat would send strong 
tremors through Haiti's ruling elites. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the President should decide whether we should accept Haitian 
refugees. With the Cuban exodus approaching crisis proportions, the refugee 
issue is more complex than ever. The moral case for accepting them is strong, 
but the practical one for discouraging them, or diverting them elsewhere, is 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Clinton takes these five steps, he would be acknowledging that a 
liberal internationalist approach cannot provide a viable answer to the 
dilemmas created by Haiti -- and now Cuba. Only then will he be able to deal 
with the role of domestic politics in foreign policy.*

she's invariably better received. Two weeks ago, for example, Mrs. Huffington's 
schedule included speeches at the Santa Barbara Yacht Club, a church mixer in 
Fresno and a Building Industry Assn. meeting near Riverside. In one afternoon, 
she addressed a dining club at the Biltmore Hotel, then visited a food project 
for the poor in South-Central L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Mrs. Huffington has become so involved in her husband's bid for power 
that she now runs her own life from his campaign headquarters in Costa Mesa and 
takes part in all his strategy meetings. Some say -- but she denies -- that it 
was her idea he should run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 She has no political experience, however, and uses her speaking engagements to 
hand down conservative New Age wisdom to audiences. A media child (her father 
was a radical Greek publisher), she hosts her own cable-TV chat show and uses 
it to counter what she calls "the parading of the morally deformed" on Oprah 
and Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 In a previous life, the woman who may become the most powerful wife in 
California was Arianna Stassinopoulos. Brought from Greece to England when she 
was 16, she began the 1970s as one of Cambridge University's more glamorous 
students and ended it as one of London's more exotic BBC personalities and 
litterateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her British credentials helped set her up as a society hostess when she moved 
to New York in 1981. She brings to her marriage a cultural fluency that earns 
dividends at the dinner table and she wins compliments on her beauty, usually 
described as "statuesque." 
</P>
<P>
 She was always ambitious but owes her American success to a borrowed strategic 
insight. In London, she had courted powerful, elderly male friends from the 
chattering classes. In New York, reportedly on the advice of her publisher, 
Lord George Weidenfeld, she targeted key women instead. 
</P>
<P>
 She befriended Ann Getty, wife of oil-heir Gordon, who, in 1985, fixed her up 
with Huffington ("I've met the man you're going to marry," she called from 
Tokyo one day.) The next year, Ann paid for their exotic wedding, at a cost of 
$150,000-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 Stassinopoulos has reveled in her new incarnation. She had drawn acclaim from 
the wrong critics for her books, which included a right-wing attack on Germaine 
Greer's feminism, a biography of Maria Callas, which led to a plagiarism 
lawsuit and an out-of-court settlement, and a reactionary revaluation of 
Picasso's art based on his treatment of women. Since then, she has moved into a 
world that values a pastel wardrobe and big hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The British have watched her career with amazement. She now has a 
multimillion-dollar lifestyle in homes in Beverly Hills, Santa Barbara and 
Washington. People also seem to take her more seriously here than in London, 
where the satirical magazine Private Eye called her "The Greek Pudding." 
</P>
<P>
 She has the taste and regal manner to carry herself and her husband among 
America's heaven-blessed. The downside of making it into Washington's 
aristocracy, however, is that she is now being intensely scrutinized by the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 While she was a player in the literary world, the English merely found her a 
figure of fun -- delightful and high-minded but not always profound. Now that 
she has moved into politics, U.S. journalists are asking whether she's 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is twofold. For more than 20 years, she has been a member of a 
Santa Monica-based church called the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness 
(MSIA, pronounced "Messiah"). The church's leader, John-Roger, has been written 
about in the press as a free-spending Rasputin, charges he has denied. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-'80s, as a minister of the church, Stassinopoulos recruited 
high-society acolytes for John-Roger and praised him for helping people to 
"wake up to the spirit inside." She says she cannot understand why John-Roger, 
"a friend," has been attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The second problem is that she prefers spirituality to politics -- and says 
so. Her new book "The Fourth Instinct" (after survival, sex and power) is about 
finding God through altruism, and the extent of her political thought seems to 
be that do-gooding brings spiritual rewards and should replace the welfare 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 This narcissistic pop-theology speaks more to the inner fulfillment of 
do-gooders than to the physical needs of the done-good-to. It was welcomed by 
health writer Deepak Chopra and Jonas Salk, whose wife -- Picasso's former 
mistress Francoise Gilot -- was the source for much of the Picasso book. 
</P>
<P>
 But it yields little about whether Stassinopoulos understands the political 
institution she wants to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if her goal is the White House, she usually sidesteps the question 
(she never denies it) by talking of being on a mission that transcends 
politics. Even her staff cannot say if a given appearance is going to be a 
campaign speech for her husband or a book promotion for her own ideas. Yet 
Huffington calls her his soul mate and doesn't seem to see her as a risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have written of her warmly or merely scoffed at her opportunism. ("I 
think of that thing inside John Hurt in the movie 'Alien,' but with better 
hair," said an interviewee in a Washington Post feature titled "Her Brains, His 
Money," adding: "In Michael, she's found a host"). 
</P>
<P>
 As the stakes get higher, however, so do the fears. Bob Colacello, who wrote 
about the couple in Vanity Fair in 1986, thinks that Mrs. H is either sincere 
in her New Age beliefs or clever, but not both. "My real issue with her is that 
I don't understand what her spiritualism is about and it frightens me to think 
that (it) could influence our government," Colacello told The Times earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 An article in last month's Mirabella also contrasted her professed 
anti-materialism with her continuing fondness for wealthy friends. (She now 
says that the vacuity of the rich helped shape her present insights -- a 
statement that may be truer that she had meant.) 
</P>
<P>
 So far, her audiences have indulged her. Her condescension touches a chord 
with the well-heeled, who like her idea of politics-as-self-help, because it 
lets government off the hook. But there's a sense that her media honeymoon is 
coming to an end, and that Huffington will have to distance himself from his 
wife's agenda if he doesn't want her to become his Achilles' heel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where she begins and he ends," says a member of Dianne 
Feinstein's staff. "He seems to embrace her philosophy. They talk about 
out-of-body experiences, walking on coals and buying crystals as a way to solve 
problems. The average working family wouldn't know what this was about." 
</P>
<P>
 Except, perhaps, in California, where there's a market for the unusual. Maybe 
she's an asset, after all.*

SMOG BUSTING RUN AMOK; THE FEDERAL EPA SEEKS TO IMPOSE REGULATIONS THAT 
THREATEN TO ALIENATE CLINTON'S NATURAL ALLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Friedman, David Friedman, director of the New Economy Project, writes 
frequently on regional and technology issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan's 11th-hour request that the Air Quality Management 
District delay its vote to impose Draconian air-pollution regulations on 
Southern California high lights yet another example of the Clinton 
Administration's inexplicable anti-urban bi as. The newly invigorated 
Environmental Protection Agency is forcing local officials to adopt severe, 
ill-conceived measures that will hurt the nation's struggling urban economies 
while encouraging population and industrial migrations into precisely those 
less-urbanized regions where Bill Clinton is most virulently opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is this self-destructive tendency more apparent than in the EPA's 
takeover, earlier this year, of Southern California's air-pollution control 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Before federal intervention, there were many positive trends in local 
air-pollution abatement. The AQMD was curbing its worst regulatory excesses, 
weighing more carefully the economic costs and effectiveness of its clean-up 
efforts while promoting a "user-friendly" image. In conjunction with local 
companies, novel measures were developed, such as pollution credits, and the 
region initiated a 30-year, $184-billion mass-transit program. Despite rapid 
population growth during the last two decades, Los Angeles has led the nation 
in improving its air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this was good enough for the EPA. After losing a lawsuit alleging that 
it had not enforced federal air-pollution laws, the agency announced, in 
February, that it was developing federal implementation plans, or FIPs, for 
areas of the country that failed to meet Clean Air Act standards. Starting with 
California, the FIPs would mandate anti-pollution measures that could be 
substituted for local plans, such as those developed by the AQMD, at the EPA's 
own discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 Warily watched by other urban officials, the results in Southern California 
shocked even the most jaded observers of federal excess. During public hearings 
last month, the Administration unveiled a 1,700-page plan -- about 400 pages 
longer than its abandoned health plan -- to regulate, for the first time in 
history, everything that could possibly contaminate the air: interstate and 
international commerce, automobiles, trucks, ships, railroads, airplanes, 
factories, zero-emission vehicles, offices, retail businesses, mass transit, 
commuters, road construction, aerosol sprays, pesticides, pleasure vehicles, 
lawn mowers, farm equipment and back-yard barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
 The FIP's 106 measures include novel, untested requirements to tax domestic 
and international ships and airlines up to $10,000 per ton of emissions they 
generate; mandatory "no-drive" days for residents and businesses; diesel-truck 
engine standards that are presently unattainable, coupled with harsh fines for 
companies whose fleets fail to comply; the retrofitting and downsizing of 
commercial vehicles; limits on the deliveries that out-of-state trucks can make 
in the region, and severe agricultural-equipment restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even proponents of the FIP -- and the now closely related AQMD plan that 
stirred Riordan's anxiety -- admit that it will strip more than 100,000 jobs 
from the local economy and cost $4 billion to $6 billion a year over 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real costs are almost certainly higher. The environmental agency 
concedes that 60 of its proposed measures cannot be quantified. Independent 
appraisals of the FIP transportation and agricultural mandates alone amount to 
$192 billion and $257 billion, respectively. Other industry experts estimate a 
40%-to-60% decline in Los Angeles' airline, port and trucking industries by 
2005, far more than the government predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with such staggering commercial, employment and social costs, it is far 
from clear that the proposals will clear the air. Decreasing the size of 
trucks, for example, could generate more pollution by increasing the number of 
trips required to move the same amount of freight. The FIP also mandates 
emission reductions that the EPA concedes it doesn't know how to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the EPA's plan encourages and reinforces the dispersion of 
high-wage, high-skill urban industries to peripheral regions of the country, 
fostering pollution where it is not currently a problem. As cities like Los 
Angeles become economically untenable, families and businesses flood into 
ecologically sensitive, pristine regions, including the Sierra Nevada 
foothills, where 8 million Californians now live, or into the intermountain 
west. This spreads environmentally harmful industrial and urban development 
problems to some of the most sensitive and least-monitored parts of the nation. 
And, by strengthening peripheral regions at the expense of major cities, the 
Administration alienates its natural political allies in favor of Nevada, Utah 
or North Carolina, where the President's approval ratings are measured in 
single digits, or the low teens. 
</P>
<P>
 How could such perverse results be possible? 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the mostly homogenous peripheral regions, major cities sustain highly 
vocal special-interest groups that have no direct ties to the local economy -- 
public-interest lawyers, actors, university professors, for example. Backed by 
an often sympathetic media, they advance agendas that undervalue middle-class 
or business concerns. Time and again, the Administration has committed the 
mistake of believing that by responding to such constituencies, it would be 
promoting "enlightened pro-urban" policies. As with the FIPs, however, it then 
discovers that it seriously miscalculated the political support for and 
consequences of its interventions, forcing a mad scramble to save face while 
trying to win back the trust of more mainstream interests. 
</P>
<P>
 A second problem is the Administration's chronic policy incoherence. Southern 
California, like other non-compliant air-pollution regions, cannot meet federal 
standards because of its geography and weather, not because residents drive or 
own more cars. Imposing the same regulations that work in regions where wind or 
rain disperse pollutants severely harms industries in less accommodating 
climates. The only economically feasible solution for such trouble spots is 
full-scale development and distribution of zero-emission vehicles and other 
non-polluting technologies to reduce "mobile source" emissions, which cause 90% 
of Southern California's smog, and lightening industrial regulatory burdens. 
</P>
<P>
 But the EPA seems uninterested in such an approach. While conducting hearings 
on California's FIP, it bowed to pressure from U.S. automakers and thwarted 
efforts by several Eastern states to adopt California-style electric-car 
mandates. Abandoning the possibility of vigorous federal support for the 
technologies California needs to meet clean-air standards, the Administration 
could only propose further regulation of the state's urban industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually the same political logic threatens to produce equally damaging 
results in water policy. Earlier this year, the Administration waded into 
California's stalled Bay Delta negotiations and proposed huge water diversions 
from statewide aqueducts to satisfy environmentalists' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture and environmental uses, however, already consume 90% of 
California's developed-water supplies. Just 10% goes to all the state's urban 
regions, including approximately 3% to Los Angeles County. By diverting water 
to the Delta without also reforming archaic state and federal policies that 
lock the state's water into less productive non-urban uses, the Administration 
further imperils increasingly tenuous urban-water supplies -- all to benefit 
bedrock Republicans like Central Valley growers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by growing opposition to its plans, the EPA desperately hopes that the 
AQMD will vote next month to impose most of its proposals, thus shielding the 
Administration from criticism. Riordan's timely intervention, however, has at 
least forced a discussion of alternatives to the EPA, and could cause many of 
the most onerous measures to be dropped completely. 
</P>
<P>
 But a far more comprehensive rethinking of the relationship between the 
federal government and local economies is ultimately required if urban areas in 
California, and the rest of the country, are to flourish. The constant threat 
that the federal government will intervene in the economy is a principal reason 
why the state's urban regions are hemorrhaging much of their resources to 
less-regulated areas. To alleviate such problems, Washington must cede greater 
authority to local entities and then unambiguously support the key initiatives 
they identify -- such as zero-emission vehicle development or water-allocation 
reforms -- that can achieve important environmental or social goals without 
eroding industrial vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than weaken his core constituencies, Clinton should champion such 
efforts. If he loses the cities, he will, without fail, also lose his 
presidency.*

THE WORLD; THE PEOPLE CASTRO CAN COUNT ON DURING TOUGH TIMES -- CUBA'S BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

International Journalism and a reporter for the Montreal Gazette.

<P>
 Andres Castillo is a rarity in Cuba these days. He's an unwavering fan of 
Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution. His support springs from a simple fact: 
Castillo is black. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of an illiterate rural salesman, Castillo went to university, became 
an author and now edits the Cuban science magazine Innovacion Ciencia 
Desarrollo -- all accomplishments he credits to a revolution that opened doors 
to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I have, I owe to the revolution," Castillo says. "Blacks, 
especially of my generation, know we were made by the revolution. So we're 
willing to put up with hardships now." 
</P>
<P>
 These are sentiments Castro desperately needs to hear. He depended on nonwhite 
support when he took power 35 years ago. Today, his country in crisis and 
Cubans leaving at a rate not seen since the Mariel boatlift in 1980, Castro 
needs it more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba's racial profile has turned several shades darker since 1959. The exodus 
of predominantly white Cubans has left behind a nonwhite majority of blacks and 
mulattoes, who make up an estimated 60% of the country's 10.7 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonwhites may well prefer drudgery than live to see the return of exiled 
Cubans from Miami. About 95% of the exile community is white. Older blacks 
easily recall the discrimination and racism of pre-revolutionary Cuba. Under 
the Batista dictatorship, blacks were barred from everything, from university 
classrooms to the best beaches in Varadero. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro outlawed discrimination and helped Cuba's poorest, among them many 
blacks who made up a disproportionate share of the uneducated and unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the signs of change are evident. One lavishly adorned apartment 
building in Havana's once-exclusive Vedado district, where four families lived 
in the 1950s, is now home for 80 families. Nearly all are black. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the building's elegant facade, however, residents subsist on meager 
food rations. Many acknowledge the gap between the revolution's promise and the 
depressing reality of Cuba today -- and wonder whether racial equality was just 
another botched experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cuba is an integrationist's dream. Blacks and whites fraternize in a 
way rarely seen in the United States, and the large mulatto population is proof 
of years of intermarriage. But recent reforms in Cuba have spawned new 
tensions. When Castro legalized the possession of dollars last fall, Cubans 
with relatives in Miami began receiving help, hurting blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, 35 years of revolutionary rhetoric have not erased the visceral 
racism that is engrained in the country. Blacks arrived in Cuba as African 
slaves and outnumbered whites through the 19th Century. After Cuban 
independence in 1902, Spanish immigrants flocked to the island and whites 
remained a majority until Castro took power. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites never hid their fear that Cuba would become a country under black rule. 
Even if Cuba officially became color-blind, many whites did not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Racism didn't disappear, it just changed," said Benito Martinez, a 
sociologist at Cuba's Martin Luther King Jr. Centre, an ecumenical organization 
associated with the U.S. group Pastors for Peace. "It became more subliminal." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, some white Cubans describe blacks in terms right out of '60s 
Alabama. Black tourists from the United States and Canada complain that Cuban 
police regularly stop them and demand identification -- experiences white 
tourists virtually never have. 
</P>
<P>
 Selma Bryant, a black woman from Montreal, said she was unable to book a hotel 
room in Havana with her white husband because the clerk assumed she was a 
prostitute. "I was dressed like a foreigner," she recalled. "But they thought I 
was a prostitute who got clothes from a foreigner." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the revolution, there have been virtually no affirmative-action 
programs, data on blacks' status is scarce and people's racial attitudes are 
not discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "By not talking about it openly, it developed spontaneously," said Juan Luis 
Martin, a white sociologist at Cuba's Academy of Sciences. "We paid the price 
-- we never had a debate about the attitudes you find today in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, anti-black sentiment is growing as Cubans endure widespread 
hardships, Martin said. "People are looking for a scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
 In "AfroCuba," an anthology published last year in association with the Center 
for Cuban Studies in New York, editors Pedro Perez Sarduy and Jean Stubbs 
contend that blacks' achievements under Castro have been concentrated in 
sports, music, medicine and the armed forces -- "probably in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why, despite the mass-housing programs, do blacks continue to predominate in 
older, poor neighborhoods?" they ask. Why are there more blacks in the 
country's jails? Why are blacks "the butt of racist comments and jokes? 
</P>
<P>
 "Why, despite the evident interracial mix of the country," they ask, "are 
black skin and black-white relationships considered socially undesirable?" 
</P>
<P>
 One answer is that blacks in Cuba, as in other Latin American countries, live 
with the psychological legacy of centuries of white dominance. Even today, 
being white in Cuba is associated with social mobility. About 73% of Cubans 
register themselves as white; in fact, the figure is closer to 40%. Still, 
Cuba's blacks may not be ready to throw out the gains they have made since the 
revolution. In radio broadcasts from Miami, they hear exiled Cubans threaten to 
repossess their homes and reclaim their lost power. 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to rally such people as Castillo. Like all Cubans, he knows 
something is painfully wrong with his country -- the three-hour waits for 
buses, the rations for food, the legalization of dollars that is creating two 
classes of citizens. But when he imagines what post-Castro Cuba might look 
like, he shudders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be like it used to be -- more discrimination, more hunger. Blacks 
would simply be worse off. And we don't want to go backward."*

THE WORLD; HIGH NOON IN MOSCOW: GRIDLOCK, SMOG AND A THIRST FOR QUICK RICHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gregory Freidin, Gregory Freidin, a professor of Russian at Stanford 
University, is a co-editor of Russia at the Barricades: Eyewitness Accounts of 
the August, 1991, Coup (M.E. Sharpe Publishers). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a popular Russian singer, Alexander Vertinsky, returned from his Parisian 
exile in the late '40s, he was so taken aback by the sight of the new Moscow 
that he exclaimed: "Oh Russia, verily I cannot recognize thee!" Then he noticed 
that his suitcases were gone. "Now, oh Russia, I verily recognize thee!" 
</P>
<P>
 Even for someone who, like myself, grew up in Moscow and has frequently 
returned during the last six years, the vision of the city is both deceptively 
familiar and unfamiliar. Since the last time I visited, a mere six months ago, 
Moscow has undergone a sea-change. 
</P>
<P>
 What is this new Moscow like? 
</P>
<P>
 High noon. Wall-to-wall traffic, throbbing, baking in an exhaust haze, 
gridlocked. Lasciate speranza -- until, all of a sudden, a patched-up black 
BMW, Moscow's preferred muscle car, jumps halfway up the sidewalk and, like a 
startled black crab, scurries onto a side street. A cabby follows. After that, 
all is stillness, except for the deafening noise of a hundred idling engines. 
</P>
<P>
 With gasoline selling for approximately half of what it costs in the United 
States and the incomes lower by several factors, most of those caught in 
traffic must be on their way to or from making a lucrative deal. The scene 
would otherwise make no economic sense, or even anthropological sense, since 
the vagaries of instability and inflation have transformed the average Russian 
from a hybrid of utopian and cynic into a primitive subspecies of homo 
economicus . It is this rough-hewn creature that wheels in his, or her, beat-up 
Zhiguli sedan or late-model Volvo -- and deals in anything from counterfeit 
caviar to shady real estate, drugs, white slavery, children's encyclopedias or 
oil futures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real boom in Moscow is in the construction business. The outskirts of 
Moscow's South West has a new skyline marked by a post-modern office tower of 
black glass and steel, which looks like a wedding cake from hell. Outside 
Moscow proper, modern single-family homes and mansions with saunas, Jacuzzis 
and yes, bidets, are rising like mushrooms amid the stone-age collective-farm 
hovels. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in food lines is as Russian as apple pie is American. But now it 
takes a special effort to see the old Moscow behind all the fruit-and-vegetable 
stalls surrounding every metro station and the rows of kiosks, with their 
liquor bottles and Mars bars. The counters of old cavernous shops, bare a year 
ago, groan under the weight of everything from farmer's cheese to imitation 
crab meat. Prices are high but Muscovites still spend little on rent. Food 
consumption has been rising steadily, and the monthly inflation is down to 
4%-5%. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're nostalgic for long lines, the best place to go is to one of Moscow's 
new financial centers. There, customers queue up for hours to obtain the 
astronomical dividends -- as much as 10% a month in non-inflationary dollars -- 
that some pyramiding schemes, calling themselves banks, pay out to their 
clients. The catch is that such a bank may have 15 such outlets to accept your 
investments, but only one to issue the "dividends" -- and only once a month. 
Chances that your principal will go up in smoke between the payout days is 
great, but not as great as when inflation was 20% to 30% a month and before the 
government began a crackdown on misleading advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever is left of the Big Politics in this world of nouveau riches and 
nouveau russes is now spelled with a small "p." No single issue or personality 
defines the political scene in Russia today. What matters is "the economy, 
stupid." Gone is the high drama of the indomitable Boris N. Yeltsin butting his 
head against Mikhail S. Gorbachev's skull, fighting communism from a tank 
turret or arm-wrestling with Ruslan I. Khasbulatov and Alexander V. Rutskoi. He 
has been upstaged by the neo-fascist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who, in a stroke 
of a clown's genius, has been tailing Yeltsin's tour of the Volga region in his 
own steamer, setting up his political carnival tent in the wake of the 
presidential train. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited founding congress of Yegor T. Gaidar's Russia's Choice party, 
now called the Party of Russia's Democratic Choice, turned out to be summer's 
sleepiest affair. Its biggest coup was to fill two-thirds of the 1,000-seat 
convention hall with delegates and guests; its biggest joke was Gaidar's ironic 
apology for proposing a rather cumbersome name for the party, since the 
preferred words liberal-democratic had already been hijacked by Zhirinovsky's 
bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankers and regional politicians, chief beneficiaries of Gaidar's economic 
reforms, who presided over the congress belong to the generation of new 
Russians -- sober, calculating and deliberate. To them, politics is serious 
business, party-building a political franchise open to all who are willing to 
hawk their socio-economic product to their local constituencies. In the 
presence of this political breed, the passionate speeches of the dissident old 
guard were slightly embarrassing. That noble political generation has been 
swept aside, swallowing the indignity of the acquittal of Gen. Valentin I. 
Varennikov, one of the organizers of the aborted putsch.  
</P>
<P>
 If there is one political issue that still evokes a lively response, it is 
crime -- whether organized or disorganized. The sound of small-arms fire in 
Moscow's residential neighborhoods has become the city's eine kleine Nacht 
Musik. Much of the violence involves gangs fighting for their turf, but ample 
and graphic crime reporting, a few assassinations of prominent bankers, a hand 
grenade tossed through a window of a bank in central Moscow -- all have had a 
chilling effect on the city. According to government statistics, so far 
unchallenged, crime syndicates have penetrated 80% of all enterprises in 
Russia; half the private businesses are owned, in part or outright, by them. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's June decree on fighting this scourge encountered heavy resistance 
from both his allies among the democrats and his foes on the right. The 
democrats protested that it violated habeas corpus, guaranteed by the new 
constitution; the communists and ultra-nationalists charged that it fell short 
of what was needed -- a one-stop police state. In the end, the Duma couldn't 
trump Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, members of the Special Police Force (OMON), wearing flak jackets 
and armed to the teeth, stroll along the busy sidewalks and stop cars at 
intersections. Their increased presence alone should give Muscovites a better 
sense of security. And while this parade of government force goes on, the 
wheeling and dealing of the new Russia will continue unabated. For the business 
of Russia today is -- and will continue to be -- strictly business.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; KWEISI MFUME; THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE BLACK 
CAUCUS' INCREASING CLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gayle Pollard Terry, Gayle Pollard Terry is an editorial writer for The 
Times based in Washington. She interviewed Kweisi Mfume in his office. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his political life-and-death battle to resurrect his crime bill, President 
Bill Clinton sought eight elusive votes from foes and friends alike. A major 
target were 10 Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus who helped 
to defeat a key procedural vote that stalled $30-billion worth of new cops, new 
prisons and new prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At week's end, the White House had persuaded three of them, and possibly more, 
to switch on a new vote in spite of their moral opposition to a bill that 
significantly expands the death penalty. Regardless of the outcome, the 
40-member black caucus has certainly flexed its muscle in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 This increasingly influential political bloc, chaired by Rep. Kweisi Mfume 
(D-Md.), played a pivotal role in the law-and-order debate. Black Democrats 
contended that tougher sentences and more prisons have not reduced crime. They 
insisted on adding drug-treatment and recreational programs, like midnight 
basketball, and other prevention efforts derided as pork by Republicans 
hell-bent to hand Clinton an embarrassing political defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter the bill's expansion of the death penalty to 60 new crimes, 
including carjacking, the caucus, which includes Julian Dixon, Maxine Waters 
and Walter Tucker, from Southern California, supported the Racial Justice Act. 
This provision would have allowed Death Row defendants to challenge their 
sentences based on statistics that indicate racial bias in the imposition of 
capital punishment. No Racial Justice Act, Mfume had threatened the White 
House, no black votes on the rule that would allow the crime bill to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The give-and-not-much-take took weeks. The delay gave opponents more time to 
chip away at the fragile support for the crime bill. The GOP leadership 
targeted Republicans who had voted for the more liberal bill in the House. The 
National Rifle Assn. targeted anyone who was vulnerable on the assault-weapons 
ban. The hardball paid off when the "no" votes also included unlikely allies: 
10 liberal black Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, it ain't over until it's over. Mfume, 45, believes in second 
chances. He dropped out of high school when he was 16. He became a teen-age 
father; his five sons range in age from 21 through 26. Mfume now represents the 
Baltimore neighborhood where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 That he has taken his fight from the Baltimore streets to the leadership of 
the Congressional Black Caucus will not soon be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Members of the Congressional Black Caucus voted with the Republican 
leadership against the rule governing debate on the crime bill. Wasn't that an 
unholy alliance?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It's down to seven. . . . It might be down to six. I've talked with 
members; the President has talked with members, and people in their districts 
have talked with them. I'm starting to see some movement among the group of 10 
who really were functioning on principle regarding the death penalty. It's a 
position I can appreciate. But some have come to realize that the fate of the 
entire bill is now tied to their vote . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Whether are not it's an unholy alliance is debatable, because it was not an 
alliance with Republicans but also an alliance with 58 Democrats. There were a 
number of members of our party, who either reacting to the ban on assault 
weapons or the prevention programs, decided not to vote for it. It was kind of 
a triumvirate. In that regard, I don't want to call it unholy, but it was 
certainly unproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does party loyalty count for anything?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (The Congressional Black Caucus has) proven to be the most loyal aspect of 
the Democratic Party. . . . It ought to be a reciprocal loyalty. The party has 
to be loyal also to those who have proven to be the most loyal to the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You said you were voting against the rule.  
</P>
<P>
 A: That was a negotiating ploy at the time, because we were going through the 
conference committee. The threat, we hoped, would gain us a concession on the 
racial-justice provision. 
</P>
<P>
 We put up a good fight. . . . I sat there with a poker face for six weeks 
trying to get this done, but once the game was over in that regard -- the 
conference committee had reported its bill out -- there was nothing else to do. 
You could vote against the bill for the sake of voting against the bill, but 
you certainly weren't going to get the Racial Justice Act. What we were going 
to get was an executive order by the President and a commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What else did you get?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We went through the same process on assault weapons in April, threatening 
then to vote against the rule if we didn't get the assault-weapons ban. People 
accused us of being obstructionists and said it would be detrimental to the 
party and we would never get the assault-weapons ban -- but we got it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We threatened again to tie up the entire process if we didn't get a narrowing 
of the "three strikes and you're out" provision, because it was too broadly 
applied. The caucus believed it would affect disproportionately people who 
really should be getting second chances. It would create a system of geriatric 
prisons, because the law was written so broadly that no matter what you did 
three times that was against the law, chances are you were going to jail for 
the rest of your life. . . . We wanted it to apply only to felonies, vicious 
felonies and capital offenses. . . . We forced it, because it was a matter of 
principle, and we won. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the prevention programs?  
</P>
<P>
 A: When the Administration wanted to present a crime bill as a Christmas 
present to the nation, the Congressional Black Caucus said we will fight to 
make sure that there are prevention programs in the bill just as there are 
punishment mechanisms. . . . People said that's economic stimulus or maybe 
you're talking about a jobs proposal. We said this bill ought to be prevention 
and punishment. . . . Again, we were called obstructionists -- we were 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the crime bill help or hurt African Americans?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't care what color you are, if you are a criminal, you aren't going to 
like the crime bill. Beyond that, if you are looking for some sense of 
security, for bans on weapons that are in our streets, for additional police 
officers and for programs for inner-city and rural young people, the crime bill 
helps you. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The majority of young black men are law-abiding. One in four gets into 
trouble. How will the bill help them?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There's been a lot of discussion about midnight basketball, which, by the 
way . . . is very regulated and supervised, and proven to be successful in 
giving people an alternative, in this case, a sporting alternative. There are 
educational alternatives. There are all types of programs that . . . are really 
prevention. I happen to believe that an ounce of prevention is still worth a 
pound of cure. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is the black caucus more aggressive this term?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely, and deliberately. . . . I wanted to bring a sense of activism 
to the dynamics of what we do. Not to say "in your face" to the Democratic 
leadership or to the White House but to lift the concerns of the people we 
represent to a different level, so that we were no longer being taken for 
granted. . . . Things have changed significantly. They've changed a little bit 
because of the new math, having 40 members as opposed to 20. But they've also 
changed as a result of the new activism -- being able to say to the leadership 
of the House and of the Senate and to the White House that while we are all on 
the same team, we are not going to be relegated to sitting on the bench. . . . 
The days of sitting on the bench and waiting to participate are over. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the current relationship between the caucus and the White House?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's a good relationship right now. It's had its low points. The Lani 
Guinier debacle clearly was a very low point. The issue of Haiti continues to 
be a low point. Above and beyond those two instances, it has been a good, 
cordial and respectful relationship. Respectful is a key word, because although 
the President and the White House may not always agree with where we come down 
on issues, the President continues to respect our decision-making process and 
the principles on which we make our judgments. We have tried to return that 
respect . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why the tensions over Haiti? Isn't the Administration's point person, Bill 
Gray, one of your former members?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It doesn't matter who the point person is. It matters what the policy is. 
We expected . . . the President to change policy (on Haiti). . . . Shortly 
after the Inauguration, there was an announcement that the Bush policy of 
repatriation would continue. That was a disappointment for the caucus. . . . 
Yet, we were prepared, even at that announcement, not to break ranks. . . . It 
was only after nine or 10 months of not being able to bring any real movement 
to the position of the Administration that you saw the activism begin among 
many of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the caucus support an invasion?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The caucus has members who support the notion of invasion, who for whatever 
reason -- whether they have a tremendous amount of Haitians in their district, 
whether they represent one of the Southern states that is being impacted -- 
have a different perspective on this and . . . are tired of waiting . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Then the caucus has other members who have tried to be consistent on policy 
with respect to invasion. Ron Dellums is a case in point. Ron has always 
advocated that the U.S. not summarily invade any nation, that we respect the 
sovereignty of nations and use diplomatic tools short of a declaration of war. 
Those are the two ends of the perspective. Most members of the caucus are in 
the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the caucus support sanctions against Nigeria?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There are members who support the notion of sanctions there. There are 
others who think they don't have enough information, or there has not been 
enough time within the country to work things out, so they are a little 
hesitant. We have not developed a caucus position that says we ought to impose 
sanctions. What we're saying is we ought to use diplomatic channels, and the 
full weight of the United States in terms of its foreign policy, to make sure 
that the situation in Nigeria does not degenerate and create a civil war so 
massive that it would make Rwanda look like a sandlot fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Closer to home and back to the crime bill, is it an urban-aid bill?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It definitely provides aid and assistance in the form of prevention 
programs, which I think . . . is long overdue. You just can't keep locking up 
people and throwing away the key. You've got to find a way to prevent people 
from breaking the law to begin with by providing options. We can start by 
producing an economy that, in turn, produces jobs. A job is still the best 
social program. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the crime bill become law?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It will become law very shortly. But the crime bill is not a panacea. . . . 
It's just one step. . . . We need effective welfare reform . . . meaningful 
social legislation that deals with the issue of discrimination . . . 
health-care legislation. . . . So many people are faced with the double burden 
of being unemployed and untrained, and then have problems of health care, which 
creates another need for money. When you look at the lack of options out there, 
more people are opting toward crime and criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the political legacy from this fight on the crime bill?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We were able to take a crime bill that was absolutely punitive in nature 
and put into it billions of dollars in prevention money to assist in giving 
hope and opportunity and options to the young people of our communities. It is 
a bill that began with no reference to weapons that now includes, for the first 
time in our nation's history, a ban on assault weapons. . . . More than 
anything else, it carries the shape of not just six months of effort but six 
months of activism and assertiveness. . . . It is not the end-all . . . but it 
is a worthwhile beginning, because prevention now is part of our discussion. 
When we talk about crime, it is not all about punishment.*

WHEN THE TRADE SCHOOL IS NO CLASS ACT; CONGRESS SHOULD ACT TO CURB ABUSE AND 
FRAUD BY SOME EXPLOITATIVE OPERATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 5% of the nation's 15 million students in higher education attend trade 
schools. Most of these schools deliver what they promise: solid training and a 
leg up on employment in a vocation. But some for-profit schools are a 
persistent and costly problem for low-income students eager for vocational 
training -- and for the federal government, which subsidizes their education. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocational schools, more businesses than institutions of higher learning, 
typically recruit students through print and broadcast ads that promise a lot: 
"We'll train you for a high-paying career . . . " in automotive repair, as a 
dental hygienist, cosmetologist or computer programmer. Some schools, however, 
deliver little in way of training and even less in terms of job placement, 
acting mainly as siphons for federal student loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade schools receive 25% of the $20 billion the U.S. government spends each 
year on student aid. Trade schools also account for 76% of all federal student 
loan defaults. In some cases, the schools enroll marginal students who do not 
finish. In others, the schools have poor instructors and inadequate equipment 
and produce students without good employment prospects. Either way, school 
operators pocket the federal aid. And sometimes they close up shop and leave 
students -- and the government -- holding the bag. To the tune of $3 billion 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, to stanch the tide of defaults on federal student loans, Congress 
required these for-profit trade schools to obtain at least 15% of their 
revenues from other sources, like co-payments from students or state, local or 
other federal programs. Congress hoped to ensure that taxpayers would pay only 
for schools that were good enough to attract buyers in a free market or those 
with aid funds from other loan programs that impose more stringent oversight or 
performance requirements on the schools. The so-called 85/15 rule was intended 
to give school owners incentive to offer quality education. This requirement, 
introduced by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), is more than appropriate. But 
Congress has delayed its implementation for two years at the behest of the 
trade schools lobby.  
</P>
<P>
 When it returns from its August recess, Congress will again take up this 
issue. The House version of the proposed Education Appropriations Act, sadly, 
includes another one-year delay of the 85/15 rule. The better Senate version 
does not include the delay.  
</P>
<P>
 Trade school students, and taxpayer-funded federal student loans, should be 
protected from fraud and abuse. The 85/15 rule must not be delayed further.

SMALL-MINDEDNESS KNOWS NO CITY LIMITS; THE BUREAUCRATIC MENTALITY, IT SEEMS, IS 
ALIVE AND WELL IN BOTH BERKELEY AND NORCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Berkeley and Riverside County's Norco may be as different as two cities can 
be, but lately they share a distinction: They both are battlegrounds in the war 
against small-minded bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 In Berkeley, residents three months ago asked for information about the 
proposed conversion of a nearby motel into a home for low-income AIDS patients 
and former drug addicts. Incredibly, those who raised questions found 
themselves the target of an investigation by the federal Department of Housing 
and Urban Development for possible violation of the federal Fair Housing Act. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the developer had not yet secured financing or applied for a city 
permit. When neighbors asked for information about zoning, site selection and 
potential residents, they instead received a letter from the city attorney's 
office. The letter stated that City Council members could not discuss the 
project in private because it might prejudice future council decisions and 
warned that questions about potential tenants could be construed as 
discriminatory and put the city and neighbors at risk of violating the Fair 
Housing Act. Later, HUD broadened an inquiry concerning those residents, who 
previously had objected to another local housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in response to an escalating war of words, HUD dropped its 
investigation. The line between legitimate inquiry and protest on the one hand 
and discrimination on the other is indeed vague; but clearly HUD and the City 
of Berkeley crossed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, the line was drawn between a Norco newspaper publisher and 
municipal officials. Lucille Oliva, publisher of the Norco News, circulation 
5,000, wrote articles about city animal control chief Michael Kulick that he 
didn't much like. Moreover, city officials contended that on two occasions 
Oliva physically assaulted Kulick and that a Norco News writer made harassing 
phone calls to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Norco sued the Norco News and Oliva for defamation, seeking $21 
million in damages. According to the city, this campaign of "improper 
harassment" forced Kulick to take early retirement and claim workers' 
compensation benefits. Oliva and the newspaper should be liable as negligent 
third parties for all benefits that the city would pay him, the suit said. 
Oliva's lawyers fought back, filing a motion to strike the suit.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a Riverside Superior Court commissioner upheld Oliva's motion, 
dismissing the defamation charges along with charges of invasion of privacy and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The battery charges, which remain, are cause for serious concern and of course 
are not First Amendment matters. But the press, including the Norco News, must 
be free to do its job without government intimidation.

THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM A SHAKE-UP; NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE MAY BRING ABOUT 
SAFETY ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are lessons to be learned from every natural disaster. One that has 
emerged from the Northridge earthquake came as a complete surprise. Meanwhile, 
a separate issue involving schoolchildren suggests that luck alone has 
prevented untold tragedies. There is much to be done on both fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-frame buildings are designed to bend without breaking under enormous 
forces such as those produced by earthquakes. In a strong temblor, they have 
long been assumed to be among the safest structures. Well, the Northridge quake 
is changing that thinking in a way that could be instructive and beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracks were found in the welds of at least 110 steel-frame buildings after the 
Jan. 17 disaster. That figure represents more than a fourth of all such 
buildings in the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside. As much as 90% of the 
connections in those structures cracked. Experts said that they were shocked . 
. . just the kind of thing you don't want to hear from experts. The California 
Seismic Safety Commission went so far as to suggest that officials in the 
western states suspend building codes and require proof that new steel-frame 
structures could withstand major temblors. That recommendation was met with 
great alarm and concern, but there is indeed a different way of viewing the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one steel-frame building was or is in danger of collapsing here. In fact, 
some experts such as UC Berkeley Prof. Abolhassan Astaneh indicate there is 
more to learn and less to fear from the way those buildings were affected. "The 
rigid frames simply cracked the stiff welds and made themselves semirigid, and 
survived the shock with almost no damage to many of the buildings," Astaneh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 What's needed is a prompt assessment of why the connections failed, how much 
stronger such joints should be and the most economical ways of erecting safe 
buildings. Studies are taking place at Berkeley and the University of Texas at 
Austin to improve building designs and determine the status of damaged 
buildings. Better yet, the California governor's Office of Emergency Services 
is funding an $18-million study to develop guidelines for the inspection and 
repair of steel-frame buildings -- just what the City and the County of Los 
Angeles have been struggling to do in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of the study, underwritten by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, will set guidelines for the inspection and repair of buildings damaged 
in the Northridge quake. This work must proceed apace. With experts predicting 
that the next major quake here could result in as many as 5,000 deaths and up 
to $145 billion in damage, it's time to learn all that we can about this 
unexpected chink in our seismic armor. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools in quake-prone areas present another set of problems, including the 
use of suspended ceilings and flimsy light fixtures that could fall in a 
temblor. And school systems have been ineffective in ensuring that every school 
comply with safety procedures and requirements as routine as having emergency 
kits and water on campuses. None of the last 10 major California quakes 
occurred during school hours. We can no longer afford to depend on such good 
fortune.

 Re "For City, One More Killing; For Family, Deepening Pain" Aug. 16: 
</P>
<P>
 The senseless killing of young Willie Nava and (last year) his sister, Lupe, 
dramatically illustrates the gut-wrenching anguish and heartache left in the 
wake of gang-related warfare and drive-by shootings. The growing list of 
innocent victims is equaled by the residual pain associated with these acts of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Willie and Lupe, so many have lost their lives for simply being in the 
wrong place at the wrong time. Or was it really the other way around? Perhaps 
it was those who broke God's law, the law of the land and the rules of human 
decency who were in the wrong place . . . who were wrong in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Most who live in poverty and experience an inner sense of hopelessness don't 
go around shooting others. Some can't deal with it without striking out. Some 
don't even want to try. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad truth is that this will continue. We can eradicate much of it if we'll 
all dig in our heels and work to eliminate neglect, hatred and racism, and the 
terrible responses they breed.

L.A. POLICE SHOOTING CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "LAPD Officers Faulted in 3 of 4 Shooting Cases," Aug. 14: 
</P>
<P>
 As a citizen and a Los Angeles Police Department reserve officer, I am 
disappointed that The Times would print such a headline and article. As a 
reserve officer, I have the unique opportunity to view police work as both an 
officer working once a week and a citizen who lives and works in Los Angeles. 
As a citizen, I have had nothing but positive encounters with the LAPD. In my 
capacity as a reserve officer working patrol assignments, I have observed only 
professional conduct by both my partners and other officers. 
</P>
<P>
 I recall an incident where my partner and I responded to a disturbance call 
only to be greeted by an obviously intoxicated individual holding a pistol in 
his right hand. Did we draw our weapons? Yes. Did we almost shoot him? Yes. 
Fortunately he dropped the pistol. Had we shot him, would your headline read 
"LAPD Shoots Man Armed with Starter's Pistol"? I ask, could your reporter or my 
partner and I have positively identified the weapon as "only a starter's 
pistol"? Would you want to make that decision? We were lucky he put it down. 
The suspect later explained that he had been arrested recently for fighting and 
was mad at the police. On more than this one occasion I have observed officers 
demonstrate cool-headed decision-making and fire control. 
</P>
<P>
 The public should be pleased that the LAPD conducts shooting investigations. 
That an officer may be given some constructive criticism or recommended for 
training is not outrageous. Who does not require additional training or advice 
over the course of his/her career, no matter what the profession? Who has not 
ever asked what could have been done to do a better job?  
</P>
<P>
 Your article highlights shootings where what the officers thought was a weapon 
was in fact a comb or no weapon at all. What you fail to highlight is that the 
call sent to the officers may have stated that the suspect had a gun or other 
weapon. As officers respond to the scene, they have only the information that 
was given to them. If this information included that the suspect has a gun, and 
the suspect reaches into his/her waistband or pockets for what turns out to be 
a comb and is shot, the press might report that LAPD shot a suspect armed with 
a comb. Is this what happened? Yes. Is this accurate or the whole story? No.

 * It would appear to me that the statistics cited represent a lot of 
overstressed police officers. One more time this comes back to an undersized 
Police Department doing an oversized job. More police officers on the street 
would provide more backup and more opportunity for an overwhelming show of 
force, hopefully negating the need for an escalation of deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
 I just wonder how long it's going to take Los Angeles to wake up and see how 
faint the "Thin Blue Line" really is?

IGNORING CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * About two months ago in the early morning hours, my neighbor, in an 
intoxicated state, fired approximately eight shots into the neighborhood. No 
words can describe what went through my mind as my mom and I lay crouched on 
the living room floor.Although no one was injured, a part of my life died. 
</P>
<P>
 I realized that the blanket of security and peace I was living under had begun 
to unravel. Those unalienable rights that were so eloquently put by our 
Founding Fathers in the Declaration of Independence were crumbling. If one 
person has the right to bear arms, where do the rights of those who choose to 
live in peace and serenity come in? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems as though the mores of society are changing where people have the 
attitude of "crime is everywhere." As if it is hopeless and is to be tolerated. 
It's time to stand up for our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes me so disgusted that some members of society can just ignore crime 
because they were not directly affected by the incident, when in truth society 
suffers as a whole.

SUPER SCOOPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We strongly disagree with your editorial urging the purchase of 
white-elephant Super Scooper aerial fire bombers (Aug. 10). Until the 1993 
brush fires that threatened our community, several of our community 
organizations supported the acquisition of the Super Scoopers.However, because 
of the extensive and excellent television coverage of that fire, we learned so 
much about aerial firefighting that we now believe that the Super Scoopers 
would be useless in Southern California brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 We learned that the only effective way of stopping the intense brush fires 
with aerial drops was to drop a large amount of water with pinpoint accuracy on 
a specific spot at the front of the fire.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Super Scooper was able to make an accurate drop on the front of 
the fire, it would be ineffective. While it carries approximately 1,600 gallons 
of water, the plane has to make the water drop at a high rate of speed. The hot 
updrafts from the fire force aircraft to fly several hundred feet above the 
ground. Thus, the water drop is sprayed over a large area when it should be 
concentrated on a single spot. The heat will vaporize the dispersed water from 
the Super Scooper before it even hits the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 If any money is to be spent on aerial fire bombers, it should be spent on 
helicopters, not wasted on Super Scoopers.

GIVE LAPD SOME MODERN TOOLS TO WORK WITH; POLICE: A $15-MILLION CAMPAIGN FOR A 
BASIC COMPUTER SYSTEM WOULD FREE UP 600,000 HOURS TOWARD A SAFER CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BRUCE KARATZ, Bruce Karatz is co-chairman of the Mayor's Alliance for a 
Safer L.A. and chairman and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based 
Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We all came to Los Angeles for different reasons. Some of us came for the 
weather or for the universities. Some of us were seeking Hollywood stardom, 
others the technology that would help us explore the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever our reasons, we must admit that there is one reason that would 
make us think about leaving -- concern for the safety of ourselves and our 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day the subject of crime finds its way into our lives. We experience it, 
we hear about it, we talk about it. We talk about our worries, our fears and 
our feelings of helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 But now there is a way for every citizen and business in Los Angeles concerned 
about public safety to assist the agency responsible for maintaining it: the 
Los Angeles Police Department. Last week, the Mayor's Alliance for a Safer 
L.A., a newly formed volunteer coalition of business and community leaders, 
launched an effort to raise $15 million to give the LAPD the technology to 
become more efficient and effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alliance was formed by Mayor Richard Riordan, Chief of Police Willie 
Williams and myself, with the hope of pulling together the diverse business and 
philanthropic community in greater Los Angeles toward one common goal: to make 
our streets safer. The gift, basic computer technology that will liberate 
officers from a sea of paperwork and maximize their crime-fighting time, will 
be the largest private donation in the history of the LAPD and the first 
large-scale initiative of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Who ever said that Angelenos can't come together for a single purpose? 
</P>
<P>
 We're asking not only businesses and private foundations, but everyone in this 
city, to take part in this campaign. We will send a message to the world and to 
the men and women of the LAPD who put their lives on the line that this 
community cares about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly, LAPD officers currently spend as much as 40% of their time 
manually completing crime reports and other paperwork. But within one year of 
the computerization made possible by the Mayor's Alliance gift, the citizens of 
Los Angeles will see a 25% decrease in the time required for police to perform 
administrative and reporting tasks, saving more than 600,000 hours annually. 
This adds up to more than 350 full-time patrol officers and detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 This is only one step toward making our city safe, but it is an important one 
that requires a commitment from each of us. We have 20 members of an executive 
committee who have pledged their financial and volunteer support, but we are 
seeking thousands more to do the same. After all, we live here, we work here 
and we are staying here. We recognize that our future depends on a safer Los 
Angeles. It is our responsibility to make sure that these goals are met. 
</P>
<P>
 Help us give the men and women of the LAPD the tools to do an even better job.

COLUMN LEFT / ROBERT H. SULNICK: CONSTITUTION FACES A TRIPLE THREAT; UNDER THE 
GUISE OF FISCAL LIMITS, A MOVEMENT IS ATTEMPTING TO PERVERT OUR RIGHTS, 
THREATENING OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT H. SULNICK, Robert H. Sulnick is executive director of the American 
Oceans Campaign, based in Santa Monica.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a movement growing in our nation's capital that all citizens should 
be aware of. The insiders call it the "triple threat." It is a well-funded, 
highly organized movement supported by the radical right, developers, the 
petrochemical industry, private-property extremists and state and local 
governments opposed to federal mandates. This movement is about fundamentally 
changing constitutional democracy as we know it. The backdoor techniques being 
used include a redefinition of a "taking" under the Fifth Amendment and attacks 
on the equal-protection clause of the 14th Amendment through the concepts of 
unfunded mandates and cost-benefit and comparative risk analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fifth Amendment provides that the government may not "take" private 
property for public use -- to build highways, dams, airports, etc. -- without 
just compensation. When there is a dispute regarding the price, the parties 
resolve their differences in court. 
</P>
<P>
 A "takings" amendment is now being attached to environmental, health, civil 
rights, labor and education bills pending before Congress. The amendment would 
distort this time-honored provision so that pollution prevention laws would 
become defined as a "taking," thereby allowing such scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
 * Factory owners could pollute unless paid by the federal government to halt 
their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Local zoning ordinances changed to comply with federal health and safety 
laws that require industrial development to be separate from residential 
neighborhoods would be considered a "taking." This would result either in 
invalidation of zoning laws or residential property owners' being compensated 
by the government for the commercial value of their real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 * The insurance industry and doctors could claim that lost profits related to 
health-care legislation are a "taking," and therefore warrant reimbursement by 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfunded-mandate amendments, like "takings" amendments, are an attempt to 
exaggerate the Constitution to the point of perversion. This attack is against 
the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Fundamental to our form of 
government is the principle that all citizens, irrespective of where they live, 
are entitled to equal protection under the law. The unfunded-mandates concept 
would inhibit any uniform federal application of law to states, unless the 
federal government pays for the full price of implementing the law. This could 
yield the following results: 
</P>
<P>
 * If Congress passes health-care reform that includes an employer mandate to 
provide insurance, state and local governments would not need to comply unless 
Washington paid its share of the employees' coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * If Congress passes a safe drinking-water act requiring all states to upgrade 
their tap-water standards, states could be exempt unless the federal government 
paid for upgrading their water systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the federal government increases the minimum wage, the increase could not 
go into effect for employees working for state and local governments unless 
Washington paid for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Another attempt to erode constitutional rights is being made through 
cost-benefit and comparative-risk analysis. This is an economic technique that 
attempts to put a dollar value on every potential benefit derived from a 
federal law. For example, in a recent EPA analysis on water-pollution rules, 
the risk of children developing learning disabilities from exposure to lead was 
weighed against the cost of removing the lead from the environment. In so 
doing, EPA attributed a cost of $4,588 per lowered IQ point to children 
suffering lead-related learning disabilities, compared with the tangible hard 
costs of removing lead from the environment. How can anyone place a dollar 
value on a child's health? Any standards enacted on this basis would be 
arbitrary and excessive and stand to deprive people of their right to equal 
protection under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 This concept, if enacted into law, would produce a "paralysis by analysis" in 
federal government. It would require an analysis and estimate of the 
prospective impact of all federal legislation and regulations on the private 
sector and on government. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though these amendments are being justified in terms of economic hardship 
during recessionary times, they are simply a surreptitious attempt remove the 
federal government from its role as protector of equal rights for all citizens. 
We must clearly communicate to our elected officials our disapproval of this 
threat before they are tyrannized into destroying constitutional rights in the 
name of "fiscal responsibility."

PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; WOODSTOCK '94: HOW I WAS BAPTISED IN MUD AND BECAME A 
CONVERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WU, Amy Wu is a journalist and a student at New York University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I went to Woodstock '94 and inhaled -- the mud and the spirit, that is. I went 
a cynic, returned home a convert. The three-day celebration was a triumph for 
my generation. 
</P>
<P>
 My girlfriend and I, two neurotic New Yorkers, screamed, laughed, stomped and 
splashed each other with mud. We were transformed from civilized suburbanites 
into hippie look-alikes. Woodstock '94 had set us free. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, I had been cynical about the revival of the Woodstock Nation. My 
friends and I rolled our eyes and made faces when we read about the metal 
detectors, the hoards of security people and the overpriced tickets. Our dread 
of the police state was reinforced when we received the list of Woodstock 
restrictions: no pets, no pot, no axes, no alcohol. In other words -- no fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we bought tickets because we clung to the dream that we would 
experience something like what happened in 1969 -- the sense of community, the 
love, the peace and the freedom from worry about expectations and the rain -- a 
world without consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 That dream came true. When the downpour started early Saturday after-noon, a 
young woman threw her arms in the air and screamed: "Yeah, yeah! It's like 
1969!" The party began; and the possibility of a police state died. Within 
minutes, the fields of a grassy knoll became a chocolate-colored mess. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a weekend without newspapers, the evening news, Bosnia, Rwanda, Bill 
Clinton's faltering crime bill and the health-care debate. In a day when most 
people lock everything lockable, and women carry mace for fear of being raped, 
no one seemed to worry about their unzipped tents. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who didn't have tents had no trouble finding a place to crash. Hands 
were readily extended to those slipping in the mud. People trusted that no one 
would step on them while sleeping. A man who stayed nude after he lost his 
clothes said that everyone was accepting of his nakedness. "In the real world, 
people would call me a faggot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The muddy city, created overnight, was all about tolerance and acceptance. 
Even when the Port-o-Sans overflowed and the concert site began to smell of 
fertilizer, young people danced, sang and waved their arms in triumph. They 
greeted each other with the peace sign, instead of the middle finger. Whether 
from California or Canada, Austria or Alabama, everyone sat up late into the 
night, bonfires illuminating their smiles, laughing, drinking beer, getting 
high, swaying and stomping to the sounds of Aerosmith and Bob Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of community at my generation's Woodstock was real. We are the 
generation brought up in a world of gangs, violence, unemployment, McJobs, AIDS 
and an ever-rising national debt. We are used to being told that we'll 
experience the American dream at a much later date. For a few short days, the 
giant "X" that haunts us was lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woodstock '94 wasn't about the music, the money or even the mayhem; it was 
the unity created from all of these elements. It was an event my generation 
badly needed. It gave us hope that we can conquer the challenges we face. If we 
had survived three days of a muddy hell, surely we can survive the shrinking 
job market, increasing costs of college, AIDS and the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a turning point for me. Never in my life had I screamed, splashed in 
the mud, been so dirty and carefree. The world we had grown up in had taught us 
to be wary, to not talk to strangers, to "just say no." Woodstock changed all 
of this in the best way. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, like every great moment, the new Woodstock Nation had to come to an end. 
The decline began late Sunday morning, when a group of young hippies complained 
about the smelly mud, the leaky tents and the $11 pizzas. I knew it was over 
when I had a dream about my hair dryer and color TV. 
</P>
<P>
 My girlfriend and I had gotten up at dawn, rolled down the muddy knolls once 
more, stood on the bleachers and stared at the mess of feet, hot dog buns, 
pizza boxes, deflated beach balls, Pepsi cups, beer cans and colorful tents. I 
remember feeling terribly sad; everything felt like a hangover. Monday morning, 
we would return to paying off college loans, looking for a job, taking out the 
garbage, and listening to the "as long as you live under my roof young lady" 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry," my girlfriend urged. "We'll be back 25 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 But we both knew it would never be the same again. In a few days, the mud, the 
music, and the madness would be a memory of our youth.*

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * MURDERED WITNESSES: Approved offering rewards of $25,000 each for 
information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the slayings of two 
people early this year who were witnesses to a 1993 slaying in Los Angeles. On 
March 4, 1993, Willie Bogan was shot to death and Charles Lafayette was charged 
with the slaying. One witness to the shooting, Gloria Jean Lyons, was shot and 
killed in an alley near 88th Street and Central Avenue on April 3, 1994, before 
testifying in the case. Another witness, Georgia Denise Jones, was fatally shot 
June 13, 1994, near the corner of 87th Place and Wadsworth Avenue after 
testifying. The jury deadlocked in the trial of Lafayette, who was in custody 
at the time the two witnesses were slain, and his case is awaiting retrial. A 
$25,000 reward is also being offered for information concerning Bogan's 
killing. Anyone with information on these cases is urged to contact detectives 
at (213) 237-1310. 
</P>
<P>
 * POLICE FUND: Voted to establish a special police assistance trust fund to 
which residents of council districts 8 and 15, which include much of 
South-Central and all of Watts, can make contributions to raise money for 
equipment for the LAPD's Southeast Division. 
</P>
<P>
 * ILLEGAL DUMPING: Approved a motion to provide $1,000 to help finance the 
Business Watch Group Program of the Boyle Heights Chamber of Commerce in its 
efforts to deter illegal dumping, graffiti and break-ins in the Olympic/Soto 
Industrial Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 * ANTI-CRIME BILL: Voted to support the anti-crime bill that has been pending 
before Congress. The bill's provisions include funding for 1,000 to 1,500 
additional police officers for Los Angeles, a $25-million grant to the city for 
drug treatment programs and money for more prosecutors, prisons and shelters 
for battered women. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * CITY HALL MURALS: Instructed the Cultural Affairs Department to 
proceed with a plan to decorate the safety net atop City Hall with 
reproductions of murals painted by area students. In a recent competition 
involving fifth-graders from four elementary schools in the city's east, west, 
north and south quadrants, eight murals out of 800 entered were selected. Two 
murals from each school will be placed on the tower facing the direction of the 
corresponding school. Patrick Media Group, the nation's largest billboard 
maker, will reproduce the murals free of charge on 14-by-48-foot vinyl to be 
placed on the safety net, which was installed to protect the tower's 
earthquake-damaged veneer from falling onto lower level roofs. Passed 13-0. 
Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, Jackie Goldberg, Mike Hernandez, Nate Holden, 
Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rudy Svorinich Jr. and Rita Walters. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

DANA PARSONS: WORKING UP THE COURAGE TO QUIT CAN BE A TOUGH JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four employees at an Irvine insurance agency won the lottery last week. As if 
that weren't enough to make the rest of us hate them on the spot, they really 
rubbed our noses in it by promptly quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the theory that we get fulfillment from our jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The four women who split the jackpot will reportedly each take home a little 
more than $60,000 a year for the next 20 years, after taxes. Right now, they 
may be thinking they'll never go back to work again, but I wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 How many of us would quit if we hit the lottery? Or, would we just ask for an 
enhanced vacation package? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it the prospect of not working that would fill us with pleasure, or would 
the real joy come from the act of telling your boss you're quitting? Let's face 
it, it may be the only time as an employee that you wield any power at all. 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't had that many jobs, so my quitting technique still qualifies as a 
work in progress. But in looking back on the times I have quit, I can chart 
some progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The first job I quit was as a paperboy in Omaha in the early 1960s. I had a 
huge route of more than 200 papers. I loved folding the paper into thirds and 
tossing it onto people's porches. I remember people like Mr. and Mrs. Applebee 
waving cheerily as I pedaled by on my bike and asking me if I'd like to come in 
for some freshly baked cherry pie before continuing my route. (I made up that 
whole last part about the Applebees, because my route was actually in a seedy 
area near downtown and I was scared to death most of the time.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, I had the route for a week but decided to quit when my dad had to get 
up with me at 2 a.m. on Sunday to run me down to the paper so I could begin 
folding the massive Sunday edition. Even then, I wasn't a 2-in-the-morning kind 
of guy, and, more to the point, neither was my dad, so I went in the next day 
and told my supervisor we were moving to Colorado. I was terrified that he 
would be able to tell I was lying and somehow prevent me from quitting. 
Besides, who was I, a lowly 12-year-old, to tell an important newspaper 
supervisor that I was quitting? 
</P>
<P>
 Miraculously, he allowed me to resign my position without making a stink. And 
let the record show that the lie was partially offset because I actually did 
move to Colorado, 15 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The next job I quit was strictly based on cowardice. While in college, I 
worked Friday nights in the sports department of the Lincoln Star newspaper. I 
was in my second year and wanted to attend a concert on a Friday night that 
happened to fall on my birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, still fighting that fear-of-authority thing, I was too chicken to ask 
my boss for the night off. So I quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Please give me credit for at least not lying. 
</P>
<P>
 By my mid-30s, however, I hadn't resigned in eight years and must have thought 
it was time to try it again. I took a walk in the moonlight one May evening in 
Denver and decided I wanted to quit and move to California. I had no job lined 
up but was filled with exhilaration over the notion of quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 I gave myself 24 hours to think it over, typed a letter of resignation to the 
editor, and never looked back. It remains one of the most intoxicating things I 
ever did. I gave the note to the editor's secretary to give to him. To my way 
of thinking, I was doing it properly by avoiding bothering him, but a friend 
said my technique was awful: when you quit, he said, you tell the person 
directly. 
</P>
<P>
 My resignation skills have rusted again. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's because I don't hate going to work these days, and that leads me 
back to the four women who quit on the spot after winning the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 After quitting in Denver and moving here, I didn't work for about 18 months, 
other than as a free-lancer. That was by choice but after a few months of 
staying home, I started thinking the unthinkable: Do I really miss going into 
work ? Do I miss contact with other humans?  
</P>
<P>
 I began coming into The Times' office more and more often. On days when I 
could have gone to the beach or just hung around the house -- which I once 
thought was the perfect life -- I found myself making up reasons to drive over 
to the office. When I started dropping in so I could get the tuna sandwich in 
The Times' cafeteria, I knew I had some soul-searching to do. 
</P>
<P>
 I concluded that I missed the socializing that comes with work. I realized I 
was spending far too much time at home watching the same spider walk the same 
wall every day. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm now 6 1/2 years deep into full-time employment. I'd love to feel that 
exhilaration that quitting brings, but I have to ask myself, how long would it 
be before I started missing the tuna sandwiches again?

SOCIAL SERVICES AND A CHANGING COUNTY; LATINO EFFORTS IN HEALTH, FOSTER CARE 
WORTHY OF SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1990 federal census showed that Orange County's ever-increasing Latino 
population had reached more than 550,000, nearly 25% of county residents. That 
is a number large enough to demand recognition in both the private and public 
sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of 30 Latino doctors took note of the changing demographics and 
announced they would establish eight comprehensive-care centers in the county. 
From a business standpoint, that would seem to make sense. But it is the 
group's broader goals that are worthy of notice and support. 
</P>
<P>
 The physicians said they wanted to bring bilingual, culturally sensitive care 
to the low-income Latinos of Orange County, and keep the doors open longer to 
serve those needing help after hours and on weekends. Health care providers 
said patients were likely to be better served by someone who knew their 
language and their culture. Grouping dozens of doctors also makes economic 
sense, because the coalition can seek managed-care contracts, the current trend 
in health care, especially in California. Insurers and businesses are looking 
for organizations of doctors that can serve the various medical needs of 
employees, rather than relying on sole practitioners or sending workers from 
city to city seeking the care of specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors joined together in June and have won endorsements of their plans 
from several leaders within the Latino community. They also have made their 
presence felt outside the examining room, as with this summer's donation of 
time and money to a walkathon for kindergarten students that was intended to 
provide role models for youngsters. A founding member of the organization, Dr. 
Fernando Montelongo, said members wanted to get involved in scholarships and 
voter registration, both causes that deserve support. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cause worthy of support by Latinos is foster parenting. Social workers 
say the number of Latino children entering the foster care system in Orange 
County has increased dramatically, but there is a shortage of temporary homes. 
Instead, the youths are admitted to Orangewood Children's Home, where nonwhite 
foster children were twice as likely as whites to spend 60 days or more, 
according to a recent county study. There is a need for African American foster 
parents as well, because state law requires social workers to make every effort 
to place children with foster parents of the same race or ethnic group. When 
foster parents are unavailable, children can wind up in temporary shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster care is intended to be a temporary solution, with the long-range goal 
the reunification of children and parents. When that proves impossible, 
children usually become eligible for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 A county official specializing in foster care said that many children speak 
both Spanish and English, but their natural parents often speak only Spanish. 
The trauma of being separated from parents deepens if children are placed in a 
home where the adults speak no Spanish, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county shares in the blame, because it has so few Spanish-speaking social 
workers and recruiters of foster parents. Social service officials need to 
recruit more Spanish speakers and ensure they appear before Latino groups to 
solicit foster parents. The head of the county Social Services Agency 
acknowledged the problem, saying officials did not keep up with the changing 
demographics. But he must see to it that the county solves the problem, not 
just acknowledge it.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has changed; social services must keep up.

CANING PROPOSAL TOUCHED A RAW NERVE; BUT DISCIPLINING YOUNGSTERS WITH A PADDLE 
MAY NOT BE JUST, OR HELPFUL FOR THAT MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) certainly got people talking when he 
proposed that youthful graffiti vandals become the recipients of as many as 10 
whacks from a wooden paddle.  
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, the proposal did not make it out of the Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee, but the closeness of the 11-11 vote indicated what a raw nerve 
Conroy had touched. 
</P>
<P>
 His proposal, coming in the wake of the controversial caning of American 
teen-ager Michael Fay for spray-painting cars in Singapore, got national 
publicity as people increasingly were fed up with vandalism and looking for 
ways to impart a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy actually managed to provoke some serious discussion of the merits of an 
old idea, corporal punishment as a corrective device, including testimony from 
one psychologist, Charles D. Willis, who worked in California prisons, and told 
legislators that "early corrective discipline" would keep some youngsters out 
of prison and that "ordinary discipline" would not damage their psyches. 
</P>
<P>
 The question, of course, is what is helpful or constructive discipline, and 
there are serious questions both about the wisdom and constitutionality of 
paddling.  
</P>
<P>
 The California legislative counsel's office, which provides legal opinions for 
lawmakers, said it was unconstitutional. However, the staff counsel for the 
Assembly Public Safety Committee, which approved the measure in June, said it 
was an open question because there was "no bright line" setting the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the discussion of violent felons having histories of being victims of 
child abuse and whether or not the courts could sanction violence, the proposal 
sent the wrong message: that violence is acceptable punishment. The proposal 
was criticized roundly by children's rights advocates, educators and civil 
libertarians. 
</P>
<P>
 The wonder may be that the issue got so much attention at all. It's a reminder 
of the dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system that is out there and a 
sign of how politicians are responding to it.  
</P>
<P>
 One way or the other, swift and just punishment for crime is appropriate. But 
whether having parents or court bailiffs whacking youngsters with a 
three-quarter-inch paddle would be just or helpful is an entirely different 
matter.

DORNAN TAKES ISSUE WITH 'DISTORTIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Is it no wonder that there exists this extraordinary liberal-created 
mythology about Bob Dornan when almost every article in which I am mentioned in 
The Times is either sensationalized or distorted. Two recent examples. 
</P>
<P>
 First, in a recent story on the Republican nominee for the 70th Assembly 
District, Marilyn Brewer ("GOP Candidate Has Foes in Own Party," July 31), I am 
accused by Brewer of sending out letters advising pro-lifers to "watch out for 
this Wicked Witch of the North that kills babies." This is outrageous and 
untrue. No such statement was written or spoken. I wouldn't recognize Brewer if 
my life depended on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the actual line from the letter: "One of Tom's (Reinecke) opponents is 
strongly pro-abortion and is being supported by the California Abortion Rights 
Action League and the 'new' Barry Goldwater." That's all of it. No mention of 
Brewer. Nothing in there about a "wicked witch" or "killing babies." An apology 
from "Republican" Brewer is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, in a recent story on the pro-life movement and the murder of an 
abortionist in Florida ("Abortion Clinic Slayings May Kill Operation Rescue," 
Aug. 10), The Times writes that, "Only a scattered few conservative Republican 
lawmakers -- notably Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and Sen. Robert C. 
Smith (R-N.H.) -- have rallied to the defense of anti-abortion militants this 
time." This is simply not true and bears no relation to what I told the Times 
reporter. I condemned the killing in tough, clear statements. 
</P>
<P>
 What I said was that Paul Hill and Michael Griffin have "betrayed the pro-life 
movement" and that the people of Florida should "lock Hill up and throw away 
the key, just as they did with Griffin." I was very clear in my condemnation of 
pro-lifers who advocate violence. Yet, The Times ignored my statements and 
instead printed what it wanted to believe before the reporter phoned me. 
</P>
<P>
 REP. ROBERT K. DORNAN 
</P>
<P>
 R-Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 * The Concord Coalition reported in The Times (July 31) that my congressman, 
Bob Dornan, has the worst deficit-spending record in the Orange County 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 That very point was brought "home" to me last week when I received in the mail 
one of Mr. Dornan's taxpayer-financed constituent newsletters. (I last received 
one of these during the previous election year.) Clearly, Dornan doesn't 
hesitate to waste thousands of our hard-earned dollars in a thinly veiled 
attempt to promote himself for the upcoming election.

REVIEWING THE FULLERTON RECALL EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times' editorial ("This Recall Should Be Recalled," Aug. 8) is seriously 
flawed and demands rebuttal. First, there never would have been a recall, 
according to the published statement of the Recalls Committee, had the City 
Council placed the utility tax before a ballot of the voters. That would have 
been "representative democracy" at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead the citizens of Fullerton were met by what they perceived as 
stonewalling and arrogance. That precipitated the Recalls Committee into 
action. What followed was representative democracy at work with the voters of 
Fullerton recalling the three responsible City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the city initially acted in a different manner, much, if not all, of the 
cost and divisiveness that resulted could have been avoided. By that I refer to 
the actions of City Hall with respect to the election process. Therefore, this 
was not a "single-issue" situation but rather a multi-issue situation.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, in the perfect world, the November ballot would have been the ideal 
solution. If you had taken the time to read the entire text of the recall law, 
(you) would have learned that it was written by those with enough foresight to 
precisely cover many situations, including those exactly like this. For 
accuracy, the $117,000 election cost you quoted, according to the Registrar of 
Voters, should be reduced by $10,000 for their shared costs normally incurred 
in a consolidated November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Your attempt to relegate this editorial into a neat, one-sided package is a 
disservice hardly worthy of a prominent piece in a leading newspaper. No 
apparent attempt was made to weigh the evidence other than to reach a foregone 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Over a year ago when the Fullerton recall effort was initiated, The Times 
correctly pointed out the folly of such single-issue protests. This example of 
responsible journalism set the high road and went unheeded. Now the financial 
costs alone to the city of Fullerton general fund will exceed $290,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the recalled council members, I appreciate your farsighted attempt 
to inject reason into our California municipal electoral process. This recall 
is indeed a sad commentary on the principles of representative democracy.

TOOL'S HIGH PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article, 'Political Races May Be Lost in the Translation,' (July 30) 
revealed what very few voters seem to know: that candidates' ballot statements 
are not only not free but very expensive to the candidates or their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Another little-known fact is that ballot statements may be wholly fictional.No 
one reviews the statements for accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate's statement is a powerful tool. It is the only piece of election 
material that goes to every voter. It used to be an affordable way for 
grass-roots citizens to reach voters, but now it's too costly for most 
public-spirited citizens.  
</P>
<P>
 I hope The Times will become the voice for all local candidates and a watchdog 
for voters by giving adequate, accurate coverage to school and community 
college board candidates. Citizens rely on the press to check statements for 
truthfulness.

TAXES PROVIDE NEEDED SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I've never understood what are true conservative Republican principles -- 
lower taxes, fewer regulations and less government interference in our lives 
("Intraparty Squabbles Aid GOP Rivals," Letter, Aug. 14). 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean the terrible taxes that provide us with highways, bridges, 
libraries, schools, child labor laws, meat inspection, consumer protection and 
product labeling on our food and drugs, just to mention a few "government on 
our backs" controls? 
</P>
<P>
 Silent majority of the Republican Party 70th Assembly District: Who would you 
appeal to if you were out of a job, sick, hungry and homeless -- your wealthy 
Republican friends or big business? Most likely you would head for the 
unemployment office -- God forbid, a government agency -- or seek refuge for 
food and shelter at a mission. 
</P>
<P>
 There is more to life than saving the rich from taxes.

WATER RUNOFF CAN HELP IN GREENING OF THE ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The proposed catch basins on Aliso Creek to contain urban runoff are, at 
this point, a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 It is outrageous that they and/or on-site retention methods were not required 
when the developments causing the problem were built. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, what about the fact that the Aliso Water Management and other agencies 
will have to share the million-dollar cost? And what about the county, which 
will have to give up precious parkland to enable the catch basins to be built? 
</P>
<P>
 I hope it is obvious that Laguna Beach should not participate in the cost of 
this project. However, it is time that the city resolve to pledge its support 
in establishing a dual system for reclaimed water and participate in . . . 
building the lines for its distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The . . . (reason) that 70% of the usable reclaimed water is being dumped into 
the ocean is because, as yet, there is no distribution system for it. With talk 
of creating a greening fire-protective ring around our community, there is now 
a particularly urgent need for this water. 
</P>
<P>
 We should all begin to face the fact that our water supplies are now and will 
continue to be diminishing because of the demand throughout the West. Thus, 
eventually we will have no choice but to utilize this resource as other 
communities, such as Irvine, are now doing. 
</P>
<P>
 I also question: Why is there no law requiring those responsible for creating 
the problem in the first place to have taken care of it in their developmental 
planning? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, when will the Legislature, Board of Supervisors and city councils 
have the guts and concern to address the cause and require that, whenever 
possible, property owners do something about it? The runoff problem can be 
transformed into another resource for the greening of our environment.

LACK OF DATA IMPACTS AIRPORT REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am somewhat appalled by a flagrant example of the letter of the law 
winning out over the spirit of the law. The example exists in Draft EIR No. 
552, which evaluates the potential environmental impact of all-cargo aircraft 
operating out of John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Big as it is, this environmental impact report is incomplete. No effect of the 
Federal Express aircraft (the Airbus A310) is included, and it will be flying 
out of John Wayne just as often as UPS' 757-200, the aircraft that is included. 
This omission is covered by the oft-repeated statement that the data was not 
available. Reasonable enough. But isn't the purpose of an environmental impact 
report to assess the impact? Without the data, the impact is left out, even if 
the report does weigh five pounds or so.  
</P>
<P>
 I believe we are a country that prides itself on following the rule of law, 
and not the rule of subterfuge or violence. But the rule of law requires 
following the spirit of the law, not merely the letter of the law. Surely the 
data, in this case, will become available in a reasonable time. Delays and 
costs are important considerations, but glossing over omissions just to meet 
the letter of the law defeats the law's purpose and denigrates the principle 
that our country follows.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON THE RAMS; LETTING TEAM GO WOULD BE 
IRREVERSIBLE FINANCIAL, CULTURAL LOSS; THE FRANCHISE IS WORTH SAVING AND WE 
SHOULD FIGHT TO KEEP IT, IF WE WANT TO MAINTAIN THE COUNTY'S BIG-LEAGUE STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEIGH STEINBERG, Leigh Steinberg, a Newport Beach sports attorney and agent 
to many of the nation's top professional athletes, has been leading a community 
effort keep the Rams pro football franchise in Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most thrilling memories of my youth was sitting on my father's lap 
in the Los Angeles Coliseum watching Ram Jon Arnett run a kickoff back 101 
yards for a touchdown. Forty years later, one of the special moments of my 
adult life was sitting with my very excited 3-year-old son, Matthew, in Anaheim 
Stadium watching Jerome Bettis run for a long touchdown. Absent quick and 
dramatic action to keep the Rams from leaving Southern California, moments like 
these and this area's professional football heritage will disappear forever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have made crystal clear their intention of concluding a deal within 
the next month to move to St. Louis, Baltimore or Hartford, Conn. You may ask 
why, as residents of a county devastated by earthquakes, fires and floods, we 
should care about the fate of a local sports team. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, we'd lose money: $30 million to $50 million of extra revenue is 
generated in Orange County by the Rams and their fans each year. Losing this 
highly identifiable business enterprise would trigger a devastating ripple 
effect on our economy. 
</P>
<P>
 For another thing, our lives would be less interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooting for local teams is a rich source of joy and pleasure for many of us. 
Sports allows people of disparate racial, economic and occupational background 
to share a bonding, enriching experience. Our area waited so long and worked so 
hard to obtain a full complement of professional sports franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County on the cutting edge of political, cultural and sports 
activities gives definition to an area that needs to be known as more than "not 
L.A." It would represent a step backward to allow a team to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 And make no mistake, the loss of the Rams will signal the end of professional 
football in Orange County. The Rams will proclaim to the nation that they faced 
a uniquely inhospitable business and political climate in Orange County, that 
Orange County consumers are horribly non-responsive, and that governmental 
agencies are intractable in their regulatory zeal. 
</P>
<P>
 These messages will resound through the front offices of the National Football 
League, and will sour the league and team owners on this area. The lack of 
protest from Fox TV regarding a prospective Rams move indicates network 
television's willingness to live without the Rams in the Los Angeles market. 
Remember, St. Louis, Oakland and Baltimore have never had their lost franchises 
replaced. In fact, in the last NFL expansion process St. Louis and Baltimore 
were passed over in favor of smaller markets -- Jacksonville, Fla., and 
Charlotte, N.C. In an expansion, the NFL will simply not look to return to a 
failed site. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, in any effort to woo an existing franchise, Orange County would be 
competing with municipalities not burdened with our budget and taxation woes. 
We would be up against municipalities so starved for a professional franchise 
that they will gladly offer sweetheart stadium deals and upfront 
multimillion-dollar transfer fees. Orange County would not win those battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, fans must realize that, even apart from the the economic and 
cultural reasons, the Rams are worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are angry with the Rams because of poor play on the field or a 
perceived lack of commitment to winning must look past their frustration and 
realize how quickly this can change. 
</P>
<P>
 A new salary cap system in the NFL has imposed minimums and maximums on the 
amounts teams can spend on their players. It will not be possible for the San 
Francisco 49ers to far outspend the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 With economic parity, winners and losers will be distinguished by talent 
evaluation and player development. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent acquisitions of Jerome Bettis via the draft and Chris Miller via 
free agency bode well for the Rams' future. With a winning season or two behind 
her, Georgia Frontiere, whom I know to be a good and warm-spirited woman, would 
become a popular owner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams can be successful, and with aggressive marketing a refurbished 
Anaheim Stadium could be full for autumns to come with boisterous, happy and 
loyal fans. The presence of The Pond in Anaheim, a refurbished football 
stadium, a new baseball stadium, the Convention Center, Disneyland and Knott's 
Berry Farm, combined with the presence of the Rams, Angels, Mighty Ducks and 
potentially a new basketball team, would make us one of the most exciting 
entertainment corridors in the world. It would boost a revitalized Orange 
County economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But only if we fight now to save the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Local businessmen, columnists and politicians seem to be fulfilling their own 
prophecies by predicting the Rams' departure while cynically ignoring the need 
to fight for the Rams. The pride they feel in being correct in their prediction 
could, without rapid and effective action, be outweighed by their guilt from 
having helped to push the Rams out. We need to act -- now. Orange County has an 
opportunity to display the energy and maturity that will mark its coming of age 
as a community.

HOMEOWNER GROUPS CAN FIGHT FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article "Homeowner Groups Easy Fraud Targets" (Aug. 15) had a 
significant error of omission -- it didn't say that this type of problem occurs 
rarely in our industry and that it can usually be prevented through responsible 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 While any industry that handles money can be taken advantage of by 
unscrupulous individuals bent on committing a crime, the possibility of this 
happening within a homeowner association management firm can truly be minimized 
if homeowners' groups ask these pertinent questions of their existing or 
prospective management companies: 
</P>
<P>
 * Are there proper risk management controls in place within the company, such 
as internal financial policies, insurance policies, and adequate staff to 
ensure a thorough checks-and-balances system is maintained? 
</P>
<P>
 * Does the company have the business savvy and resources to be prepared to 
respond to a situation such as the one reported, or is the firm operating on a 
shoestring because of its expense?  
</P>
<P>
 * Can the company make reparation -- immediately and appropriately -- should 
such an incident occur? 
</P>
<P>
 The real worth of a homeowner association management company is measured not 
only in terms of its price for services, but in its ability to keep its 
immediate and prospective commitments operational and legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the California Assn. of Community Managers (CACM) are required to 
adhere to a code of ethics and standards of practice and we have a 
certification program endorsed by the Department of Real Estate. So another 
question homeowners' groups can ask its manager is, 'Are you a member of CACM, 
and are you certified?' 
</P>
<P>
 We hope that this information is of use to your readers.

DOG OWNERS CAUSING OWN PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Having just returned from a trip to Montana where I had the pleasure (?) of 
visiting the city of Billings, I had an experience that brought to mind the 
recent Times article about Laguna Beach. Seems that Laguna dogs aren't very 
discreet about where they do their business, and "dog parents" aren't picking 
up after them. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently in Billings, they had a similar problem. We had our Labrador on 
vacation with us, and in attempting to seek out a place to walk her one night, 
we were told by a local that dogs had to be walked in the alleys in Billings. 
No dogs were allowed in public parks, schools or any public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, it just didn't seem like Billings was a very "user friendly" city. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I can see things going in this direction here if dog owners won't 
start picking up after their dogs. They wouldn't even have to buy those fancy 
blue bubble containers; a simple plastic bag can be tied through the handle on 
a leash. It's that easy! But probably like everything else, the privilege of 
walking a dog in a public place will eventually be lost because people just 
won't take responsibility and be considerate of others. And dog owners will be 
the first ones to yell because a "right" has been taken away. Seems this 
problem of responsibility starts at a very mundane level!

SPORTS STARS DON'T DESERVE IDOLIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The picture of 7-year-old Patrick Stebbins wondering (about) his dream of 
seeing the Angels ballgame was really heartbreaking ("Striking Back," Aug. 10). 
But remember, kid, these players are not in this to please you.In spite of all 
the talk to the contrary, it's the money that talks; the "fans" are just there 
to provide that cash. 
</P>
<P>
 You will not be out much if you find a real interest in your life -- a real 
sport, not one that relies on a bouncing ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But then you may not have any heroes, such as great sportsmen like Pete Rose 
or that wonderful husband Steve Garvey or the one last month involved in the 
drug scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat, don't just write them a letter and pout. Do as I do: Never set foot in a 
ballpark, listen to or watch a game, or even glance at the sports section. Find 
another activity, one that is much more interesting than watching a bunch of 
grown men stand around, spit, scratch themselves and chase a little ball.

 * Good people of California, (speaking on behalf of illegal immigrants), we 
ask you to consider, who will bus the dishes, pick the fruit and mow the lawns 
if we are driven out? We are humble, working people, striving to earn our daily 
bread and hoping for a better life for our children. 
</P>

 Do you propose to "cleanse" California of its brown people? Christians, please 
reflect. Who is more your neighbor than the poor working men and women who 
clean your houses and prepare your food?

 Please work with us to make this a better state, not a cruel and hardhearted 
one.

SOMETIMES EUTHANASIA IS ONLY SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As one of several dozen Mission Viejo Animal Shelter volunteers, I must 
respond to the errors in the letter (Aug. 7) from Pepe Michel.  
</P>
<P>
 The city employees who staff our pro-life shelter are professionals who are 
dedicated to providing humane care for the animals we shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The dozens of trained volunteers who clean cages, feed, bathe, groom and 
exercise our guests care deeply about animal welfare. We have cared for many 
unlovely but still lovable animals for many months until the right person came 
along to adopt them. We have comforted animals during necessary euthanasia and 
wept over them. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that 106 animals were euthanized between July, 1993, and May, 1994. 
Forty were for medical reasons because sadly it was the humane the thing to do, 
and 46 because the animals had a history of vicious behavior, and it would have 
been irresponsible to allow them to be adopted. The total number of animals 
impounded during that time was 1,146, and over 1,000 were redeemed, adopted or 
are still awaiting a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who care for our city's lost and abandoned animals are deeply hurt 
by the irresponsible accusation of murder when occasionally euthanasia is the 
only responsible and humane choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Michel, please visit our shelter and introduce yourself so that we can 
give you the facts. Since you say you are concerned, you might even want to 
join your neighbors in helping us provide care.

CRIME KNOWS NO SOCIOECONOMIC LIMITS; TAY SLAYING ILLUSTRATES NEED FOR POSITIVE 
DIRECTION, EVEN AMONG PRIVILEGED YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How can things that are going so right for some young people end up going so 
wrong? The sentencing this month to life in prison without parole of Robert 
Chan, 19, who had been a brilliant student at Sunny Hills High School in 
Fullerton, ended a disturbing chapter in the murder of Stuart A. Tay of Orange 
on New Year's Eve in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps young people who have everything going for them, and equally 
important, their parents, will have some lasting lessons to contemplate. The 
judge's remarks in the sentencing would suggest that is the case, and so would 
the stunning letter Chan wrote to the parents of his victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan was found guilty of masterminding Tay's murder; he was one of five Orange 
County teen-agers convicted of the beating death. Two other defendants pleaded 
guilty and the other two were convicted of first-degree murder and await 
sentencing. During sentencing of Chan, Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary 
said she could not reconcile the backgrounds of the youngsters with the robbery 
they contemplated of a Anaheim computer parts dealer. The plan later fell 
apart, according to prosecutors, and the judge said, "It is inexplicable to me 
that Mr. Chan, given the love and support of his family, and Mr. Tay, given the 
love and support of his family, would even come together to plan a residential 
robbery." She went on, "I think this case is not only tragic for these 
families, but it's also a tragedy for society. I think there are a lot of 
families and a lot of parents who are wondering how this could happen."  
</P>
<P>
 Chan wrote the Tay family, "I shudder when I try to imagine how you must feel, 
I know your pain is infinitely worse. I know now, all too late, that not only 
have I destroyed one life, I have destroyed many." 
</P>
<P>
 How do we get youngsters to assess the consequences of their actions before 
the fact, not after, especially those who are as privileged as these young men 
were? How is it possible for such youngsters to believe that violence is an 
option, and to have them make decisions that perhaps will ruin their lives? 
Generally, the young people we hear about today who give no thought to tomorrow 
come from a different world entirely, the world of gangs.  
</P>
<P>
 This case is a reminder that the need for positive direction for young people 
knows no socioeconomic boundaries, and why programs in personal ethics, such as 
were developed recently in the Irvine public school system, have broad 
application in a society in need of bolstering.

RAIDERS CONTROL THE RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: THEY OPEN A 20-3 HALFTIME LEAD AND GO 
ON TO A 29-20 VICTORY. HOSTETLER PASSES FOR 169 YARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They didn't figure to meet in the Super Bowl, but after Saturday night's 
one-sided brawl with the Raiders, "Save the Rams" takes on a whole new meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram quarterback Chris Miller (cut chin), defensive tackle Sean Gilbert 
(sprained ankle) and defensive end Gerald Robinson (sprained ankle) were 
seeking medical treatment -- not a head start to Baltimore -- as they made 
their way to the locker room before the conclusion of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (3-1) not only dominated the Rams, 29-20, before 50,315 in Anaheim 
Stadium, but nearly ended the Rams' season before it officially began by taking 
out their best players. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks in Baltimore will be pleased to know that Miller, Gilbert and 
Robinson are expected to recover, but for the die-hards in Anaheim, it still 
looks as though it will be unproductive business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' No. 1 offensive unit, while flashy on its first possession, failed 
again to locate the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Jerome Bettis ran nine times for 27 yards. Miller completed 10 of 
19 passes for 111 yards. Flipper Anderson caught five passes for 45 yards. But 
the Raiders were winning by 20-3, it was only halftime, and mistake-prone 
rookie tackle Wayne Gandy had yet to play a down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' special teams were not so special, and the first-string defense, 
which is supposed to be the Rams' best claim for success this season, looked as 
if it was on orders not to touch Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defensively we could not get any pass rush," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. "They 
threw for a lot of yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler completed 15 of 21 passes for 169 yards, threw a 25-yard touchdown 
pass to tight end Andrew Glover and ran four yards for another score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys were very up for this game," Raider Coach Art Shell said. "We're 
getting closer to where we want to be. We're going to focus on the opener with 
San Francisco. I'm not worried about the progress of this team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams moved smartly from their 16-yard line to the Raider five-yard line on 
their opening drive. But center Bern Brostek was penalized 15 yards for a chop 
block. Instead of getting a touchdown, the Rams settled for Tony Zendejas' 
39-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams threatened again late in the first quarter, but Knox had his team 
punt rather than seek a first down on fourth and one from the Raider 36-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking possession at the Rams' 20-yard line on Sean Landeta's punt into 
the end zone, the Raiders drove 80 yards in 11 plays to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler passed to Glover for the touchdown, and then found Tim Brown for the 
two-point conversion and an 8-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays and a punt and the Raiders were back in business again with kicker 
Jeff Jaeger expanding the lead to 11-3 on a 33-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams continued to go nowhere as Miller bounced passes to Anderson and 
overthrew Jessie Hester, thereby putting the Raiders back on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 A 35-yard pass interference call on Steve Israel -- one of eight penalties for 
104 yards against the Rams -- quickly put the Raiders into scoring position at 
the Ram 13-yard line. Two plays later, Hostetler cruised into the end zone for 
a four-yard touchdown and the Raiders were ahead, 17-3. 
</P>
<P>
 After Miller fell on a poor snap from center and threw two incomplete passes, 
Landeta punted and the Raiders came on to score again on Jaeger's 43-yard field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half belonged to the reserves. Chris Chandler threw a seven-yard 
touchdown pass to tight end Troy Drayton and Jamie Martin threw a 38-yard 
touchdown pass to Sean LaChapelle with 25 seconds remaining for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw some things that were encouraging tonight," Knox said. "We just have to 
go back and work harder and play tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had several things to be encouraged about. Linebacker Rob 
Fredrickson, the team's No. 1 draft choice, was beaten for a touchdown in the 
second half, but rebounded to stop running back Johnny Bailey on the two-point 
conversion and later recovered a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-string Raider defenders kept the Rams from scoring a touchdown, and 
wide receiver Rocket Ismail caught five passes for 57 yards.

MORNING BRIEFING: IN THE SPRING, THEIR FANCIES WILL TURN TO DREAM TEAM III 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USA Basketball says it will start putting together the 1996 Olympic team in 
the second half of next season, starting with the coach, most likely Atlanta's 
Lenny Wilkens, after the all-star break and then the players sometime in the 
spring. That's when things could get interesting, because the best talent might 
not make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Johnson and Derrick Coleman might have played themselves out of Olympic 
gold medals with their trash-talking and physical antics during the recent 
World Championships. USA Basketball wants the class to have class. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Sam Smith of the Chicago Tribune, based on interviews with 
committee officials, presents the early line for the Atlanta Games: 
</P>
<P>
 CENTERS -- Shaquille O'Neal, David Robinson and Alonzo Mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 FORWARDS -- Shawn Kemp, Scottie Pippen, Horace Grant, Chris Webber and Glenn 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 GUARDS -- Reggie Miller, Tim Hardaway, Anfernee Hardaway and Joe Dumars. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumars might have been the most popular member of Dream Team II, but he will 
be 33 in the summer of 1996, by which time Latrell Sprewell should be reaching 
his prime as a shooting guard who can penetrate, play defense and be an 
emergency point guard. And when did John Stockton suddenly get tossed to the 
scrap heap? The best point guard in the game can't slip that quickly behind 
versatile Anfernee Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: How many times has Pat Riley finished out of first place in his 
12 years as an NBA head coach? 
</P>
<P>
 Huskey huff: Apparently the fallout from Don James' resignation as Washington 
football coach nearly a year ago still hasn't ended. James' successor, Jim 
Lambright, fired offensive coordinator Jeff Woodruff, who is also James' 
son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 As Steve Kelley of the Seattle Times notes: 
</P>
<P>
 "Lambright knew that firing Woodruff was the right thing to do. If Woodruff 
weren't married to James' daughter, it would have been greeted with universal 
cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Lambright also knew his decision could cost him any chance he might have 
of a friendship with James, his mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The James family requested Lambright not attend last winter's tribute to the 
former coach, a petty and potentially divisive decision, considering the 18 
years of hard work, dedication and quality Lambright gave James." 
</P>
<P>
 Booooooooog: Former Oriole first baseman Boog Powell took his barbecue 
pit-beer garden to Saratoga race track after the baseball strike closed him 
down at Camden Yards. That doesn't mean he's a serious horseplayer, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look for somebody to mark my program," he said. "Then I go to the clubhouse 
and have whatever the cocktail of the day is." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: None. The worst he has done is a first-place tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Kurt Rambis, now a special assistant coach with the Lakers, when 
once asked his opinion on drug tests: "I'm in favor of it, as long as it's 
multiple choice." SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

HOLY BULL PUTS THE RABBIT BACK IN HAT; HORSE RACING: COLT WITHSTANDS PRESSURE 
FROM COMMANCHE TRAIL, WHO WAS PUT IN RACE TO INCREASE CHANCES OF TABASCO CAT, 
AND WINS THE TRAVERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were doubts Holy Bull could win at 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 It was said he couldn't handle pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gray colt handled pressure throughout the 1 1/4 miles Saturday at 
Saratoga and won the Travers Stakes, holding off Concern by a neck at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a true champion, and there can't be any doubters today," said Mike 
Smith, Holy Bull's jockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat, the Preakness and Belmont winner, was never a factor and finished 
third, 17 lengths back in the five-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any horse under me today," said Pat Day, Tabasco Cat's jockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat was followed by his stablemate, Commanche Trail, entered as a 
rabbit by trainer Wayne Lukas to put pressure on Holy Bull, and Unaccounted 
For, who upset Tabasco Cat in the Jim Dandy on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Croll, Holy Bull's owner-trainer, had heard his front-running colt 
disparaged after his 12th-place finish as the Kentucky Derby favorite, although 
he went into the Travers on a three-race winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Holy Bull opened a solid lead in the stretch and then displayed the 
courage needed to hold it against Concern, who surged on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 75-year-old Croll showed up in the press box for the postrace news 
conference, he walked past the stage and the microphone to a television set 
that was showing a replay of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 He watched it, then he watched another replay of the stretch duel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did what he had to do," Croll said. "They set a fast pace, and he did it 
his way." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull, the first winning favorite of the Travers since Easy Goer in 1989, 
carried scale weight of 126 pounds over a fast track in 2:02 and returned $3.60 
and $3. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern, losing for the fifth consecutive time since his victory in the 
Arkansas Derby on April 23, paid $3.40. There was no show betting. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull broke on top from the rail, but Commanche Trail, entered to help set 
up the race for Tabasco Cat, quickly took over the lead and led the field 
around the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had me trapped on the rail, and I couldn't get out," Croll said of 
Commanche Trail, who broke from the outside post and then went over alongside 
Holy Bull. 
</P>
<P>
 Commanche Trail led through the first quarter in a fast 22 4/5 and reached the 
half a head in front of Holy Bull in 46 1/5. Holy Bull then took the lead, 
reaching the three-quarter-mile mark in 1:10 2/5 and the mile in 1:35 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look up at that board and see the fractions they made him run," Smith 
said. "It's a miracle he hung on." 
</P>
<P>
 Concern, ridden by Jerry Bailey, was last, a little more than 16 lengths 
behind with a half mile to go. But with a quarter mile left, he was only four 
lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
 He quickly moved to Holy Bull, then the favorite dug in at the eighth pole, 
seeming to have the race secured. Concern, however, charged back in the final 
strides. 
</P>
<P>
 Croll said Holy Bull's last race this year probably will be the 1 1/8-mile 
Woodward on Sept. 17.

GOLF ROUNDUP; CLEARWATER LEADS BUT ISN'T HAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Keith Clearwater was a disappointed leader after the third round of the 
International. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearwater held a one-point lead over U.S. Open champion Ernie Els after 
Saturday's round at Castle Rock, Colo., but all he could think about was how 
many points he let get away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really bummed out," Clearwater said. "I let myself down quite a bit 
coming in. I had short putts on 15, 17 and 18, and I didn't make any of them. I 
left seven points out there in the last four holes, and you can't do that under 
this format." 
</P>
<P>
 The format at the International uses the modified Stableford scoring system, 
which awards points for birdies, eagles and double eagles and subtracts them 
for bogeys or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Points are cumulative over all four rounds. The 144-player field, which was 
reduced to 72 for the third round, was cut again to 24 for the final round. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearwater's 11-point round gave him a total of 30 points. Els had the day's 
best round -- a 17 that included a tournament record-tying 10 birdies -- for 29 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kite and second-round leader Steve Lowery were tied for third at 26, Mike 
Reid and Dave Stockton Jr. stood at 25, Rick Fehr had 24 and Bruce Lietzke 23. 
Lee Janzen, Jay Haas and Tom Lehman were at 22. Eleven golfers were within 
eight points of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal was one of five players surviving a 
six-way playoff for the final spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those missing the cut were Chip Beck, Tom Watson, Fred Couples, Davis 
Love III and Ian Baker-Finch. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearwater, who began the day with 19 points, bogeyed the third hole to drop a 
point but then ran off four birdies to make the turn with 26 points. He then 
birdied the par-five 14th and 17th holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Els had what amounted to an eight-under-par 64, having only one flaw in his 
10-birdie round -- a double bogey at the 12th hole when he drove into the 
hazard to the left of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stockton shot a six-under par 66 and holds a one-stroke lead over Jim 
Albus going into the final round of the Burnet Senior Classic at Coon Rapids, 
Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was testy," said Albus, who also had a 66, of the windy playing 
conditions. "I play in Florida and you have to be able to control the wind 
there. I think I'm a good wind player. But Dave Stockton is not exactly the guy 
you want to be going up against if it's windy." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton is at 134. George Archer shot a 69 and is in third place at 136. 
First-round leader Dick Rhyan double bogeyed the first hole and quickly fell 
off the board. He finished with a 77. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Geddes broke out of the pack with three birdies in a five-hole stretch on 
the back nine to take a three-stroke lead after the third round of the LPGA 
Chicago Challenge at Naperville, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Geddes, who began the round in a six-way tie for the lead, rebounded from a 
bogey on No. 9 with birdies on Nos. 11, 12 and 15. She finished at 
four-under-par 68 for an 11-under total of 205 on the 6,256-yard White Eagle 
Golf Club course. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Platt, who shot a 69, joined Janice Gibson and Dale Eggeling at 208. 
Gibson and Eggeling, who began the round tied with Geddes, Kathryn Marshall, 
Michelle Estill and Katie Peterson-Parker, each shot 71.

BEACH VOLLEYBALL; KIRBY, MASAKAYAN CRUISE, THEN STRUGGLE TO ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-ranked Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan breezed through their first match 
on Saturday in the $40,000 World Championships at Manhattan Beach, but the 
defending champions struggled in their second match before finally winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby and Masakayan scored a 15-3 quarterfinal victory over eighth-seeded 
Jackie Campbell and Charlotte Roach in the morning.But a couple of hours later, 
Kirby-Masakayan, the winningest team in women's pro beach volleyball, committed 
a series of unforced errors that almost caused them to lose the semifinal 
against fourth-seeded Gayle Stammer and Monique Oliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby and Masakayan trailed, 11-8, before scoring seven consecutive points -- 
three of them aces by Masakayan -- for a 15-11 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "They definitely had some unforced errors that they normally don't have," 
Stammer said. "But then they had some great defensive plays that took points 
off our serve." 
</P>
<P>
 Masakayan, who was hospitalized last week because of a pelvic infection, says 
her team's slow start was not related to her sitting out three days of practice 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great," she said. "I just think we were a little too hyper. We weren't 
focused and our ball control was not as sharp. . . . Then we said enough is 
enough!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the other winners' bracket semifinal, second-seeded Lori Kotas and Barbra 
Fontana defeated third-seeded Dennie Knoop and Deb Richardson, 15-12, after 
trailing, 9-4.

DEL MAR; PACE IS RIGHT FOR D'HALLEVANT IN PAT O'BRIEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Ron McAnally glanced away from the race for a second and checked the 
half-mile time on the tote board. He quickly looked toward the far corner of 
the track, where his horse, D'hallevant, was clinging to the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 What he had seen was enough to tell him his horse was in good position to win 
the $100,000 Pat O'Brien Handicap, a Grade III race for older horses. 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. D'hallevant, under Corey Nakatani, held off a late challenge 
from stretch-running Minjinsky and won by five lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ran all day long in 44 and change (for the half-mile)," McAnally said. 
"I looked up and saw 45 and thought we'd be tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The track seemed to be getting faster as the day progressed, the first 
half-mile in races four, five and six all being run in 44-plus seconds. Even a 
field of maiden 2-year-old fillies ran the half in 44 2/5. D'hallevant, the 
only proven front-runner in the feature race, went out in 45 seconds, 
encouraging McAnally to conclude he had energy in reserve for the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 D'hallevant came out of the gate with Subtle Trouble, a longshot, on his 
shoulder, but Subtle Trouble would be no trouble at all. McAnally was watching 
Minjinsky, the other favorite, who was loping along in last place, but only 3 
1/2 lengths behind. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time D'hallevant turned for home, Subtle Trouble was gone and Nakatani 
was stealing peeks over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made an easy lead," Nakatani said, "and he was relaxed out there. I was 
taking a peek just to make sure nobody was getting too close." 
</P>
<P>
 No one did. Minjinsky blew past the rest of the field but was no match for the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minjinsky cut the corner and saved ground on the inside," McAnally said, "but 
he couldn't catch up." 
</P>

 Saturday's second race, the $60,000 Sandy Blue Handicap, was a cut above the 
norm because of the caliber of today's Del Mar Oaks. These were 3-year-old 
fillies whose owners and trainers wanted nothing to do with the likes of 
Sardula and Work The Crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 La Frontera finished first, but had squeezed Baby Diamonds against the rail at 
the top of the stretch, causing jockey Chris Antley to take up and then forcing 
Gary Stevens to take up on Dancing Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy inquiry, Dancing Mirage was given the victory. Musical Pal, 
who was not directly involved with La Frontera's meanderings, moved up to 
second. Both of those fillies were moved to the Sandy Blue to avoid today's 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, La Frontera was placed fourth, Baby Diamonds moving up to the 
third spot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sardula, trained by Brian Mayberry and ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, is the 
8-5 morning line favorite in the Grade I $175,000 Del Mar Oaks. The 3-year-old 
filly, the horse of the meet here last year, scared off all but five 
challengers today. She had not run since finishing second to Lakeway in the 
Hollywood Oaks on July 10. 
</P>
<P>
 One who was not scared off is Work The Crowd, trained by Greg Gilchrist and 
ridden by Chris McCarron. She was the winner of a four-horse blanket-finish in 
the San Clemente Handicap on July 30 and comes into the Oaks the No. 2 pick at 
5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others from under that San Clemente finish, second-place Pharma and 
fourth-place Malli Star, are also in the field, Pharma at 4-1 and Malli Star at 
6-1. The third-place finisher in the San Clemente was Dancing Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor in the race probably will be Twice The Vice, back with the 
fillies after finishing second to Saltgrass in the Oceanside Stakes opening 
day. She is at 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem and Mamselle Bebette, two high-strung and speedy fillies, will 
race between the fifth and sixth races in a match race billed as the Showdown 
at the Seashore. The first match race at Del Mar in 56 years might not be 
compelling in terms of national interest, but it is a bit of a conversation 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "My horse is fast, very fast," said McCarron, Soviet Problem's jockey. "And I 
know she'll try all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani got into the race as Mamselle Bebette's jockey after Cool Air, Soviet 
Problem's initial opponent, was scratched because of an infected throat. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not the easiest horse to ride," Nakatani said of Mamselle Bebette, "but 
she's won a few stakes for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem is favored at 3-5 and Mamselle Bebette is 4-5.

JUNIOR WORLD SERIES HAS HOWARD'S STAMP ALL OVER IT; LITTLE LEAGUE: HE HITS TWO 
THREE-RUN HOMERS IN THOUSAND OAKS' 20-3 TITLE-GAME VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Kevin Howard got Thousand Oaks to the Little League Junior World Series 
championship game with his pitching and he led them to the title with his 
hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, the team's starting shortstop when not on the mound, went three for 
three with two three-run home runs and six runs batted in as Thousand Oaks took 
the 13-and-under title in a 20-3 rout over Hamilton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Howard pitched a complete-game five-hitter to beat this same Ohio 
team, 5-2, and get Thousand Oaks into the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the greatest feeling," said Howard, who was six for 12 with seven 
RBIs and 2-0 from the mound in the series. "I couldn't believe it when I hit 
the second home run. In the World Series!" 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams expected a tight contest -- Thousand Oaks and Ohio were clearly the 
two best teams in the eight-team field, and Thursday's game was closely played. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the second inning Saturday under threatening skies, the only drama left 
was whether or not Chris Strauser could complete a no-hitter and if the rain 
would make the clay-based field unplayable.  
</P>
<P>
 Howard's first home run, which cleared the fence in right-center in the top of 
the first, made it 3-0. After Strauser singled and Kris Palomeres walked in the 
second, Howard hit another fastball even farther over the right-center fence to 
make it 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks scored 10 times in the fourth on four walks and five hits to 
lead, 17-0. By the seventh inning, the skies had cleared and the Californians 
took the Sheridan Community Field scoreboard to unfamiliar territory. Zeke 
Morrow's RBI single gave Thousand Oaks 20 runs and flipped the score back to 
zero on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were ready to bust one," said Thousand Oaks coach Craig Frazier. "They 
worked their butts off. And Ohio had to play five days in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing to Thousand Oaks Thursday, Ohio had to rally from a 6-1 deficit 
in the sixth inning against a team from New York the following day to get out 
of the losers' bracket and into the final. To win the title, Ohio would have 
had to beat Thousand Oaks twice Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "After those two home runs, I figured we weren't going to come back," said 
Ohio Manager Bob Jackson. "We came back (Friday), and it took a lot out of us. 
Our hands were slow, our bats were slow. People don't realize what a grind this 
series is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their pitcher was throwing real hard, and we couldn't get around. He pitched 
a great game. Second-best in the world isn't bad."  
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks had 15 hits and received 15 walks from three Ohio pitchers. 
Starter Phil Bell didn't make it out of the third inning after giving up seven 
runs. Relievers Andy Mignery and Danny Bradner didn't fare much better. Mignery 
gave up 10 runs in 1 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came out to the mound the first time, Andy told me he didn't want the 
ball," Jackson said. "He's a horse. He always wants the ball, and he was 
exhausted. I told him to give us one inning and we'd take him out." 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 runs were the most Thousand Oaks scored in any game throughout 
qualifying and the series itself, and four short of the World Series record of 
24 scored by Hawaii in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "After it was 7-0, I think they kind of gave up," said Howard, who was walked 
twice intentionally. "Everybody was more relaxed at the plate, and they waited 
for their pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Strauser, whose effort was almost overlooked by the offensive carnage, kept 
his no-hitter deep into the sixth inning, when Bradner singled to right with 
two out. In the seventh, Phil Bell doubled, advanced on an error and scored on 
a wild pitch to break up the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did I have a no-hitter?" asked Strauser, who struck out seven and walked two. 
"I didn't even know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Right fielder Wes Munyon had a double and two walks, scored twice and made a 
nice running catch at the warning track. Catcher Doug Hutton was two for four 
and had four RBIs. Second baseman Matt Rodgers and first baseman Jon Shepard 
each scored three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Munyon and Hutton gave Frazier and Manager Ed Kitchen a 
Gatorade bath on the infield grass. Upon being presented the four-foot tall 
championship trophy, the team took a Stanley Cup-style run around the outfield, 
holding it aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California is the baseball capital of the world, and we just wanted 
to maintain that tradition," Frazier said as he wiped sweat and Gatorade from 
his forehead. "I just want to go home so I can shave this damn goatee off."

BOWLING / DANA HADDAD; FORKEL PICKED HIMSELF UP AND THE PINS BEGAN FALLING DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Eric Forkel doesn't know if it was God or Mother Nature. And he doesn't know 
if there was any veiled meaning for him in the catastrophic Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 He just reacted. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical Valley resident, Forkel scrambled to avoid a death trap when he was 
awakened at 4:31 a.m. on Jan. 17 to hear the sound of splitting wood and see 
the walls of his Chatsworth townhome twisting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't thinking," Forkel said. "I thought the world was ending." 
</P>
<P>
 He had packed his clothes and bowling gear the night before. That morning, he 
was to embark toward the first stop on the Professional Bowlers Assn. Winter 
Tour. It was in Lakewood -- a quick sprint down the 405. 
</P>
<P>
 If something or somebody was telling him to get out of Southern California, 
well, then OK, Forkel thought. Why not? His condo -- at the corner of 
Devonshire and Mason -- was not far from "ground zero" and would soon be 
condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still bowl," he thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he could still make it to Lakewood Jan. 18 for the first round of 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Forkel leaped out of bed, amid broken glass of a fallen chandelier, and ran 
into the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't put my shoes on and I felt something warm in my foot," he said. "And 
I looked down and I was bleeding profusely." 
</P>
<P>
 A clean cut -- a half-inch deep on the bottom of his left foot behind the big 
toe -- nearly severed some tendons and sent him to the hospital for stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a wheelchair while a doctor in the urgent-care ward closed the gash 
with surgical staples, Forkel faced another grim, more-immediate consequence of 
the quake: he couldn't bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Forkel was sidelined from the tour for a month, missing the first four stops. 
He spent two weeks on crutches, two more in rehabilitation and, with no income 
other than a nominal sponsor's check, spent idle moments wondering how much 
more the injury would affect him when he finally could lace on a pair of 
bowling shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My nerves were on edge," he said. "I was not a happy camper." 
</P>
<P>
 Forkel, 33, was angry at the set of cards he had been dealt. His pro bowling 
career had been marked by one long struggle to make it to the PBA Tour (he was 
a rookie at 31), a major breakthrough in 1992 and another drop-off in '93. He 
was eager to make a comeback in '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally able to bowl in a tournament in Missouri in mid-February, Forkel took 
out his frustrations on the pins. 
</P>
<P>
 He made the stepladder finals March 5 in the PBA National Championship in 
Toledo, Ohio, finishing fifth. He took third in the U.S. Open in Troy, Mich., 
on April 9 and finished second at the Tournament of Champions in Akron, Ohio, 
later that month. 
</P>
<P>
 Three television appearances in 10 weeks put Forkel in the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made three shows," Forkel said, astonishment in his voice. "That's better 
than I'd ever done in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1978 Van Nuys High graduate became only the fifth man in tour history to 
reach the finals of each of the PBA's three national championship events in one 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "An amazing turn of events, considering what I went through," said Forkel, who 
wore a doctor-prescribed non-friction sock on his left foot for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Forkel has already earned well in excess of $100,000 (including bonuses) this 
year with eight events remaining. He currently ranks 10th on the tour in 
tournament earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Forkel won't forget the concern other bowlers showed by phoning him from 
Lakewood the day of the quake. Rich Wolfe of Virginia, Forkel's roommate on the 
road, paid a personal visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of nice, even though I was sutured up and had shots and felt 
lousy and couldn't do anything," Forkel said. "I didn't want to deal with 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 And about moving out of town, Forkel is waiting for a loan to be approved so 
he can build a home in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was planning to move there in about four or five years," he said. "But I 
took a loss on the townhome, and I'm not going to take a loss there again. I 
basically got earthquaked out of California." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By a single pin: One more pin and Barry Gurney could have pushed Tommy Evans 
to an extra frame in last week's Showboat Senior Invitational in Las Vegas. Two 
more pins and Gurney of West Hills might have tripled his earnings in the 
$160,000 tournament -- the biggest of the year on the PBA Senior Tour's regular 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they fall. Sometimes they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurney, 53, lost to Evans in the third match of the televised step-ladder 
finals at Showboat Lanes, 236-235. Gurney was seeded second. Through 56 
qualifying games, his average was 235, the exact number he rolled against 
Evans, who qualified third (234). 
</P>
<P>
 But the two extra pins fell for Evans, who went on to win the tournament and 
$24,000. Gurney finished third, taking home $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Near-misses are nothing new to Gurney. In 1993, he rolled a perfect game 
during qualifying and was ranked No. 1 in the final of the Springfield (Mo.) 
Open when he was beaten on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Branham's run: The fortunes of Arleta native George Branham III proved 
opposite those of Gurney last week. In Tuesday's finals of the Sherwin-Williams 
Classic in Bedford, Ohio, Branham played the spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying fourth in the PBA regular tour event, Branham beat Mike Edwards of 
Oklahoma City then upset Tim Criss of Bel Air, Md., and Don Moser of San Jose 
before he fell in the final to Dave Husted of Milwaukie, Ore., 279-238. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his first televised appearance this year, Branham posted 257, 268 and 
224 in his three victories and earned $14,000.

PAULINHO FEELS GOOD ENOUGH TO HEAL SALSA; SOCCER: HE HAS THE FLU AND ALMOST 
DOESN'T PLAY, BUT HE MANAGES TO SCORE TWO SECOND-HALF GOALS IN TEAM'S 2-1 
VICTORY OVER VANCOUVER. 
</P>

<P>
 Star Salsa midfielder Paulinho has a flair for the dramatic that, well, a guy 
better have to make that one-name thing work. 
</P>
<P>
 And true to form Saturday night, the high-scoring Brazilian provided his best 
by saving it for last. Slowed by the flu and doubtful to play, Paulinho scored 
two goals in the second half of the Salsa's 2-1 American Professional Soccer 
League victory over Vancouver in front of 3,396 at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulinho scored his first goal at the game's 58th minute, beating Vancouver 
goalkeeper Rob Merkl to tie the score, 1-1. His second goal, in the 81st 
minute, came on an assist from standout forward Paul Wright and sealed the 
Salsa's second consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa (6-5-1) tightened its grip on third place in the APSL. Vancouver 
dropped to 5-7-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Paulinho) came up big for us," Wright said. "He really finished that second 
goal real nice, and we needed that." 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad night's work for someone who was coughing up blood a few hours 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "My body was feeling weak (before the game)," said Paulinho, who scored in his 
third consecutive game. "(Coach Rick Davis) said, 'Let's experiment for 15 
minutes and see what happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, a resounding success. The league's scoring champ and MVP last season, 
Paulinho scored his fifth and six goals, second most in the APSL. Wright has 
three assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The 86ers led, 1-0, at halftime on a goal by defender Steve MacDonald, who 
scored on a header off a pass from midfielder Dale Mitchell, one of the 
league's best offensive players, in the 14th minute. The ball just eluded the 
outstretched arms of goalkeeper Mike Littman and landed in the left corner of 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite outshooting Vancouver, 7-2, in the first half, the Salsa was unable 
create close scoring opportunities around the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't worried," Wright said. "With the way we've been playing, we knew 
we'd score." 
</P>
<P>
 Littman played well in goal for the second consecutive game. He shut out 
league champion Colorado, 3-0, last week at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a good two weeks," Littman said, "for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa plays at Vancouver on Friday.

SAUGUS SPEEDWAY; 7 CYLINDERS STILL PLENTY FOR CROMSIGT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gerrit Cromsigt continues to add track records at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night he added to his track record with his seventh consecutive 
main-event victory, pulling away to win the 25-lap Pro Stock oval race despite 
running on seven cylinders for more then half the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it missing about the 10th lap and I figured we lost it," the Pine 
Mountain Club resident said. "But we kept pulling away." 
</P>
<P>
 Cromsigt had an opportunity to extend his streak to eight in the 15-lap figure 
8 feature race. Final race results were unavailable by press time. 
</P>
<P>
 His victory Saturday was his ninth of the season and helped Cromsigt move into 
third place in the points standings behind Arleta's Brian Kelley (224) and 
Scott Dinger of Simi Valley (203) entering the figure 8 main event. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Smith of El Monte clinched the Pro Four Modified points title with one 
race left after his seventh main-event victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mini Stock division, Gregg Davidson of Burbank pulled away to win his 
first 20-lap main event and Gardena's Jeff McCall moved closer to the points 
championship with one night left on the racing schedule.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / J. EUGENE GRIGSBY III: RULES FOR 'SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT' MUST BE SOCIALLY INCLUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. EUGENE GRIGSBY III, J. EUGENE GRIGSBY III is director of UCLA's Center 
for Afro-American Studies and an associate professor in the university's 
Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sustainable development" is a hot topic among architects, planners and a new 
breed of business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists were the first to focus on the issue when they claimed 
planet Earth was in the midst of an ecological crisis that, if ignored, would 
reduce the quality of life for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of sustainable urban development insist that cities face a similar 
crisis because of violent crime, traffic congestion and onerous bureaucratic 
impediments. Even Britain's Prince Charles, due to visit Southern California in 
November, has gotten into the act, sponsoring forums for business leaders on 
corporate citizenship and sustainable development. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately overlooked in the debate on sustainable development is the 
question of how to formulate policies that take into account the quality of 
life for all segments of our society. Stemming persistent -- indeed widening -- 
inequalities between low-income and high-income households should be the force 
driving discussions about improving the quality of urban life. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of those discussions depends on who defines the parameters. 
Individuals with the most quality-of-life choices have more opportunities to 
influence the public policy agenda. Conversely, those who have minimal 
quality-of-life choices find themselves relegated to the least sustainable 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as these inequalities continue, there will be tensions and conflict 
regarding not only what constitutes sustainable communities, but also the types 
of policies that should be pursued to maximize quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the passage of a wide range of state and federal laws, for instance, 
environmentalists have succeeded in changing behavior in ways that improve the 
air we breathe and the water we drink and protect our natural resources, such 
as wetlands and endangered species. But their absence has been noteworthy when 
issues of environmental justice have been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Historic preservationists, advocates of design standards, slow-growth or 
no-growth proponents and those who favor lower population densities also have 
succeeded in enacting policies intended, they have said, to improve the quality 
of life. But like environmentalists, these advocates have been silent on issues 
of social justice. Indeed, many argue that the results of their policy 
initiatives -- lower density limits, larger lot sizes and gated communities -- 
actually limit the ability of low-income groups, particularly minorities, to 
enjoy the enhanced quality of life that derives from their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, people interested in reducing socioeconomic inequalities -- civil 
rights groups, women's rights organizations, immigration workers and unionists 
-- have defined social justice as their arena for promoting sustainable 
communities. Unlike the others, though, their success in recent years has been 
heavily tied to the health of local, national and increasingly global 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, it is believed that socially just communities can be 
addressed only when the budget is balanced and national defense or law and 
order have been adequately financed. 
</P>
<P>
 Given these conflicting interests, three challenges must be addressed if 
sustainable communities are to become a reality: 
</P>
<P>
 * First, there is a need to acknowledge that sustainability means different 
things depending on where you are in the social, political or economic 
hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not reasonable to assume, for example, that a single mother of three 
children working for minimum wage can, or should, pay much attention to issues 
such as building designs that will attract birds -- a key element in the Los 
Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency's Downtown Strategic Plan. This mother, 
as do countless others like her, wants to know where she can obtain affordable 
child care and health care. For her a sustainable community is about the 
necessities -- not the amenities -- of life. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second, when the pursuit of a sustainable community by some may only 
exacerbate social inequalities, some criteria must be developed to assess the 
likely impact of policy initiatives on different groups. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, San Francisco, Detroit, Washington, Miami, Houston, Atlanta and 
Los Angeles all have promoted rail systems as a means of reducing air pollution 
and road congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as the Reason Foundation and others have pointed out, empirical evidence 
shows that most of the new rail commuters are not former drivers of 
one-occupant cars, but converted bus riders. Furthermore, rail ridership 
projections have not been met, so service reductions and fare increases have 
been required on bus lines to help keep transit operators fiscally solvent. The 
Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority's recent budget crisis surely 
has driven this point home. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, regional transportation systems designed to enhance quality of life have 
ended up making life worse for a majority of transit patrons -- that is, the 
bus riders, many of whom are elderly, minority, low-income and 
transit-dependent -- while perhaps making life better for a much smaller rail 
commuter group consisting primarily of white, affluent suburbanites. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, business leaders and suburban electorates must understand that a 
sustainable community means a healthy link between the urban and the suburban 
-- not suburban growth and development at the expense of urban dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sustainable communities are not likely to be achieved if key stake holders do 
not elevate social equity to a more central place in the debate. Sorting out 
conflicting values and negotiating trade-offs can only be accomplished when 
very diverse constituents are included in both the planning and implementation 
of policy.

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; SUPPLYING COMPASSION; HEALTH: AT COUNTRY VILLA SOUTH, THE 
ELDERLY AND AIDS PATIENTS RECEIVE CARE UNDER ONE ROOF. EXPERTS SAY THAT KIND OF 
INTEGRATION WILL GROW AS THE NUMBER OF NURSING HOME BEDS SHRINKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Reece, a 52-year-old woman who contracted the AIDS virus after receiving 
a blood transfusion in 1981, is fighting for her life. 
</P>
<P>
 So is her roommate -- Margaret, a 94-year-old preparing for colon surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women live at Country Villa South, a pastel-shaded, 87-bed nursing 
home in Palms. There, in a 30-bed special-care unit, the elderly and patients 
with AIDS coexist, side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 An unusual mix? Perhaps. But in many ways, Country Villa South might be 
considered the nursing home of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, experts say, there is a fast-escalating demand for the type of 
long-term care nursing homes provide -- sub-acute services such as skilled 
nursing, intravenous therapies and specialized drug treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are more and more elderly people seeking such care -- the result of 
demographics and growing life expectancy -- but so are the nation's burgeoning 
number of AIDS patients who, thanks to new drug therapies, are able to live 
longer with the disease. To complicate matters, the number of nursing home beds 
has remained static since the 1980s, and home caretakers are in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The result, experts say, is that AIDS patients and the elderly will 
increasingly find themselves under the same nursing home roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to look at the mutualities of the chronically ill, rather than to 
continue to categorize people according to disease," said A.E. Benjamin, a UCLA 
associate professor of social welfare policy who is doing research on the 
subject for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. "There's no question that 
Country Villa South is part of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is sure to cause tension. In fact, it already has: Activists and 
hospital-discharge planners in several states have claimed that nursing homes 
have denied admission to AIDS patients. More than 600 such complaints were 
filed with government agencies from 1986 to 1991, according to a report last 
year by the U.S. Inspector General's Office. Small surprise, then, that Country 
Villa South is attracting attention from health experts as far away as China. 
Country Villa not only accepts AIDS patients -- one of three known to do so in 
Los Angeles County -- but it also integrates them with the elderly, creating a 
unique atmosphere in which the two groups share rooms and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, it is the only facility of its kind where the two 
populations are integrated," said Sharon Werbel, regional director of the 
1,200-member California Assn. of Health Facilities, a nursing home association. 
Said Barbara Joseph, Country Villa's director of nursing: "Country Villa is 
cutting edge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Country Villa South, on Overland Avenue just south of the Santa Monica 
Freeway, is operated by the Country Villa Health Service Corp. The for-profit 
company owns 1,200 nursing-home beds in the Los Angeles area. It was company 
president Stephen Reisman who decided four years ago to open the sub-acute care 
unit for people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reisman never intended for AIDS patients and the elderly to room together. 
The original concept was that there would be a separate wing. But there were 
not enough referrals of AIDS patients to sustain the unit, Reisman said, and 
there were numerous elderly patients who needed the skilled nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was made to consolidate: Those who needed sub-acute care, AIDS 
sufferers and the elderly, would share the same staff and the same space. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 23 of Country Villa South's 30 sub-acute unit beds are filled -- 16 
with AIDS patients and seven with the elderly. Room and board is $250 a day, 
which might seem steep -- especially since it doesn't include medication and 
other ancillary services. (For an AIDS patient, medicine costs an additional 
$1,500 to $8,000 per month.) Still, it is only a fraction of the cost of a 
hospital stay. And Medicare and health insurance coverage can be used for much 
of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is largely the responsibility of Michael Torgan, Reisman's cousin. 
Reisman made Torgan administrator of Country Villa in December, 1993. Torgan, 
30, has a graduate degree in business administration and health-care 
management. He supervised another nursing home before coming to Country Villa, 
but admits: "Nothing prepared me for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgan had three challenges: turn a profit at Country Villa, maintain quality 
patient care and confront -- every day -- the fear of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The profits, Reisman says, have been slow to materialize. But the quality of 
care has been high, according to health officials and relatives of patients. 
And visits to the nursing home suggest that patients have forged strong bonds, 
unfazed by the issue of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Reece, who has been living with AIDS for 13 years. She clearly feels 
a connection to her roommate Margaret. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she makes a wrong move during the night, I call out to her, 'Margaret, are 
you all right?' " said Reece, who is 52. "I want to know what's happening to 
her. We have our ups and downs, but I'm just glad I've got her." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Margaret, she's nonplussed by the questions about rooming with an AIDS 
patient. Like many of the other elderly at Country Villa, she is so frail and 
faces so many physical complications that the issue of AIDS is not important to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bob Stelzer, a stroke survivor who has physical therapy sessions with 
AIDS patients: "Well, I don't really know who has AIDS. I'm not sharing the 
same shaving utensils or anything like that . . . I feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for patients of all ages the chief concern is survival. At Country 
Villa's sub-acute care unit, the average stay is 18 days. Some patients go 
home; many die. Often, patients are so ill they can only lay in their beds, 
unable to communicate. Ask the receptionist to speak to a patient and the 
answer frequently is that so-and-so is sleeping. Or not lucid.  
</P>
<P>
 Though AIDS patients and the elderly don't appear to mind being integrated at 
Country Villa, there have been signs of concern from relatives of the elderly 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember one elderly man who was rooming with an AIDS patient who had 
absolutely no problem with the situation but was concerned that perhaps his 
grandchildren wouldn't visit him, and we moved him to another room," Torgan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the nursing home has helped allay such fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Joseph, who joined the staff as director of nursing a few months after 
the unit opened early last year, drew from her experience as an AIDS unit nurse 
in Century City Hospital. She formed a team of four staff professionals to 
educate the elderly patients and their families about AIDS and combat the 
misconception that AIDS can be transmitted through casual contact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say to these families I've hugged people with AIDS, kissed them. They've 
cried on me, sweated on me, died on me while I've held them and I'm still HIV 
negative," Joseph said. "If I worried about getting AIDS from casual contact I 
couldn't work here." 
</P>
<P>
 The message squares with that of health experts. "There's no reason to isolate 
AIDS patients," said Richard Wolfe, regional supervisor of the health 
facilities division of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Joseph, no one has removed a family member from Country Villa out 
of concern about its AIDS patients. But often, she says, fear of AIDS prompts 
families to decide against placing an elderly relative there. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal Morrow, a case coordinator at the nursing home, remembers seeing the 
relative of a prospective patient pick up one of the brochures that outlines 
Country Villa's services. After reading about long-term care for AIDS patients, 
the relative hurried out of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgan says that, initially, some nursing home staff members feared taking on 
AIDS patients. Once, he says, additional nursing assistance was needed 
immediately in the sub-acute care unit but none of the regular geriatric 
staffers wanted to help out. He said he looked into the problem and discovered 
that the employee in charge of staff development has a phobia about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fired her," he said. "When you have your staff educator saying to staff, 
'You don't want to work up there, do you?' it doesn't help create a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgan and his staff also had to adjust to the amount of care required by AIDS 
patients -- frequently far more, they say, than that of traditional geriatric 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to staff things traditionally at first. I would go to Barbara Joseph 
and say we need to cut back to this level and she would say we can't. And I 
would reconsider my decisions -- a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the challenges, Torgan and his team appear to have created a 
nurturing environment under the most extreme circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nursing home's television and recreation room one recent morning, the 
8-year-old daughter of a staff member daughter was bringing an AIDS patient a 
drink. A dog walked among the wheelchair-bound and licked a few hands. Family 
members wiped the brows of their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to interacting with the elderly in the sub-acute care unit, AIDS 
patients at Country Villa also mingle with the nursing home's regular geriatric 
residents in common areas such as the television room and outdoor patio. 
</P>
<P>
 On bad days, Torgan has plenty of letters to turn to from appreciative family 
members. One, to members of the Country Villa staff, is from the family of Joey 
Fisher, who recently died of AIDS: 
</P>
<P>
 "You gave him medicines. You helped him to the bathroom, and, when his calls 
were too late, you helped clean him from top to bottom. You fed him. You 
changed his bedding. You showered him. (Sometimes he showered you!) You rubbed 
cream into his dry skin and powered him, so he wouldn't get skin irritations. 
You put drops in his eyes which he always tried to wipe out again. You changed 
his IVs more times than any of us can remember. You dressed him for so many 
wonderful outings. You managed to deal with that damned bed that was always too 
soft to crawl out of or too hard to sleep on, and always too high for any of us 
to work around. 
</P>
<P>
 "You came with compassion, understanding, concern and the genuine feeling of 
caring. You gave Joey dignity when there was little to be had. You gave him 
hope and confidence in his own abilities, even when those became limited. You 
let him wisecrack and be funny, and you were his best audience. You let him do 
what gave him the most pleasure -- act. And when his acting covered his real 
feelings, you pretended not to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you wonder if you have made a difference, the answer is yes. You make the 
difference for patients between just surviving, and being able to live. For 
families the difference between hope and despair." 
</P>
<P>
 How strong, ultimately, will the demand be for combined facilities like 
Country Villa? That, experts say, depends in part on how much home-care service 
will be available in the future for the chronically ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Home health care is clearly the direction representatives of the leading AIDS 
and elderly support organizations favor. But experts agree that other options 
are needed, given the trends expected in long-term health care. 
</P>
<P>
 By the year 2030, close to 25% of the U.S. population will be 65 and older, 
compared to 12.5% today. And the share of AIDS cases involving people over 50 
-- currently 10% -- is also expected to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a generation in their 40s, who were very sexually experimental, who 
took the least precautions, who are moving into their 50s presenting problems 
our health care system is not prepared for," says Rita Strombeck, author of 
"AIDS and Aging: What People Over 50 Need to Know." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Torgan says Country Villa South has proven that nursing homes 
can help handle the long-term care demands of diverse populations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe, without a doubt, we made it work," he said. "We provide an 
alternative which is cost-effective, serving all races, all genders, all ages 
and all ailments."

 "T he Americans are certainly great hero worshipers, and always take their 
heroes from the criminal classes. " 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Wilde made that observation while on a lecture tour that brought him to 
St. Joseph, Mo., during the frenzied aftermath of the April 3, 1882, slaying 
there of famed bank robber and killer Jesse James. In a letter dated 16 days 
after James' death, Wilde mused about the merchandising of the outlaw's 
possessions -- his dustbin and foot scraper had been auctioned the day before, 
and crowds were gathering from some distance to bid on his door knocker. But 
even if Wilde had sent his letter by telegraph, he was lagging behind the news. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 12, a 200-page book titled "The Life and Career of Frank and Jesse 
James," written in seven days by the owner of the St. Joseph News, had arrived 
in stores, and sold out the same day. On April 13, an entrepreneurial scavenger 
in Chicago was selling swatches of blood-soaked carpet taken from James' 
cottage. And though the killers, Robert and Charley Ford, were charged with 
first-degree murder, they had already appeared on stage in Kansas City -- for a 
fee of $100 each -- to recount their deed for a rapt audience at the Theatre 
Comique. 
</P>
<P>
 If you wonder what this scene might look like today, with our instantaneous 
high-tech communications, tabloid media competition, and free-wheeling free 
enterprise, think back no farther than the weeks following the murders of 
Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Or wait until Friday and buy a ticket to 
Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Natural Born Killers" is a two-hour fever dream about the commercialization 
of violence in contemporary America, the story of bad-to-the-bone lovers Mickey 
(Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) who go on a two-week killing 
spree that turns them into pop icons, media darlings and consumer products. The 
nation's attention is as riveted on M&M as it was periodically riveted during 
the production of the movie on Joey and Amy, Tonya and Nancy, the Menendez 
brothers, the Bobbitts and, lately, on O.J. and Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just having a lot of fun making this movie when it started to happen 
in real life," says Stone. "It was so bizarre, week after week, to see these 
soap operas unfold, to see the news get more into the entertainment ratings 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Bizarre, and fortuitous. Stone, calling upon every demon and conspiratorial 
urge in his arsenal, has made what he calls a satire on "the crazy American 
landscape" where the media so glorify their villains that they have 
collectively become the greater demon. The film has so many parallels to recent 
media events, particularly the "Go O.J.!" signs seen during the Friday Night 
Bronco Ride, that it transcends coincidence and seems to cut to the nature of 
mankind itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The media are just one of Stone's targets. Every principal character in the 
film is a monster -- Mickey, Mallory, the father (Rodney Dangerfield) who 
abused her, the homicidal cop (Tom Sizemore) chasing them, the ratings-obsessed 
British tabloid TV journalist (Robert Downey Jr., with the voice of Robin 
Leach) panting to interview them, the prison warden (Tommy Lee Jones) anxious 
to punish them, and the variety of rednecks, would-be rapists and slothful 
fools murdered by them. If this movie is correct, we celebrate criminals in our 
society because we envy their freedom to act out urges the rest of us natural 
born losers suppress and deny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natural Born Killers" is too late to serve as a cautionary tale, says Stone; 
we're there. Just as the movie obliterates the lines between real and fictional 
violence, and between legitimate news and exploitation, those lines have been 
obliterated in real life. Technology and the almighty dollar have herded us all 
into a hellish corral where we are either committing ghastly crimes or being 
entertained by commercially sponsored details of those committed by others, and 
then lionizing the culprits! 
</P>
<P>
 Stone, as he did with "JFK," has rounded up far too many suspects, and his 
entire case may be just as false. And "Natural Born Killers' " dizzying 
psychedelic blend of violence and smash-cut, multimedia imagery may leave some 
people feeling faint from stimulus abuse. But you've got to love him. Stone is 
the most provocative filmmaker of his time, and whether his latest movie 
excites or repulses its audiences, it raises enough issues to keep the Op-Ed 
pages churning for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Are things really this bad? Is man as basically evil as Oliver Stone movies 
imply? Under the tenets of free speech and free enterprise, and with today's 
technology, could any society in history have avoided arriving at this place? 
And isn't "Natural Born Killers" guilty of the very things it condemns? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is (guilty)," says Jane Hamsher, one of the film's producers. 
"What I like about it is that it shows that violence is very seductive and that 
watching violence in movies is very enjoyable. You feel dirty for having felt 
that, and you can't walk away from it. You have to recognize it as part of 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Murphy, who with Hamsher optioned the original Quentin Tarantino script 
for "Natural Born Killers" (it was rewritten by Stone and two others, and 
Tarantino now disavows it), says that the movie merely "holds a mirror up to 
culture and says, 'Look, if you accept tabloid journalism and the deification 
of killers . . . this is where you can end up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Says Stone: "I'm reflecting back with exaggeration. That's my stand." 
</P>
<P>
 The media follow-up questions to "Natural Born Killers" do loom large. With 
the communications industry undergoing major shakeouts, and the survival of 
many media companies at stake, the ratings game is likely to continue coloring 
news judgment. The "tell them what they need to know, not what they want to 
know" maxim once drilled into freshman journalism students has been turned on 
its head. From USA Today to "A Current Affair," the new journalism follows the 
lead of entertainment -- find out what they want, give it to them quickly, 
promise them more -- and their success has rippled through the mustiest 
corridors of news. Even the New York Times put Tonya Harding on Page 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of blurred lines is crucial. When people can no longer tell the 
difference between fact and fiction, we can fold the tent. And that seems a 
genuine possibility, not so much because of excessive violence in conventional 
television and film drama, but from the exploitation of real tragedy and 
violence in TV news and such shows as "America's Most Wanted" and "Cops." 
</P>
<P>
 "People who assert that there's no link between television violence and 
violence in society are deluded," says psychologist Gerald Davison, interim 
dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Southern 
California. "It's a known psychological fact that if you present something 
awful to a person again and again, especially if it's glamorized, the person is 
going to become desensitized." 
</P>
<P>
 You can blame the media, as "Natural Born Killers" does, and come up with 
nothing but a doomsday prognosis, a vicious cycle of greed, aggression and 
disintegrating values. Mickey and Mallory know the power of the media they 
control, and how to manipulate it; the most dangerous weapons in the film are 
the video cameras -- security-mounted in stores, or hand-held by TV crews -- 
that provide the killers their stage. 
</P>
<P>
 But if we step outside that bleak circle drawn by the movie, society seems 
neither as damned as it appears nor human nature quite as callous. The erosion 
of family values is a major concern, but most of us do not abuse our children 
and turn them into killers, most cops do not imitate the crimes they're trying 
to solve, and the better media still cover the larger issues, arguably better 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone's comment that do-gooders aren't news anymore is wrong; coverage of the 
Rwandans in Africa, not exactly a money story to begin with, has been laced 
with features about outsiders who raced there to help save lives. And you only 
have to imagine what might have happened at Tian An Men Square, if the rest of 
the world weren't watching it live, to appreciate the positive impact of 
instant information. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions raised about human nature are just as tricky, recalling the 
timeless philosophical debate: Are we basically good and have to learn bad 
behavior, or basically bad and have to develop moral codes in order to survive? 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the answer may be found in another summer movie, Robert Zemeckis' 
"Forrest Gump," and in its astonishing appeal to millions of moviegoers. The 
film is a simple fable about a mildly retarded man who, while living through 
some of America's most troubled and soul-searching times, not only maintains 
his innocence but flourishes and prospers in the shadow of ignorance. It is 
ironic for a society that has often treated mental deficients as disposable 
humanity to suddenly embrace one so wholeheartedly, and it's tempting to read 
"Gump's" success as a sign that we're tiring of the constant diet of 
anti-heroes and thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a yearning among both adults and young people for something 
simple and pure, and 'Gump' does tap into that," says Washington clinical 
psychologist Karen Shanor. "We can empathize with him, even though we don't 
know what he's feeling. The frills are gone; he is an adult scaled down to an 
idealistic child, and he exemplifies that humanness and goodness that is inside 
each of us. In some people, you have to look pretty hard because they don't 
have the opportunity. But it's there." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the microscope, "Forrest Gump" and "Natural Born Killers" are both 
pretty simple organisms. They are fantastic views of life from opposite 
extremes, one giddily light and optimistic, the other morbidly dark and 
foreboding, neither one graced with many shades of gray. One is an outright 
escape, the other a head-on assault, and they tap opposing chords in us. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Stone has portrayed Mickey and Mallory as products of their time, all 
that really separates them from celebrity outlaws of the past are the 
accouterments of modern media. Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde . . 
. they were all feared and, in some quarters, admired. But it's a little 
hysterical to say the preoccupation with killers is peculiar to America. It is 
peculiar to human history. You can find parallels to "Natural Born Killers" in 
Greek mythology and theater, where heinous acts were routinely enacted and 
their perpetrators literally deified. They became gods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ancient societies were warrior societies, there was a kind of cultural 
investment in violence that made it normal," says Vincent Ferenga, who teaches 
comparative literature at USC. "Anyone who excelled at being violent in warfare 
was going to enjoy a kind of privileged class." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferenga says that Greek society had rigid purification rituals for soldiers 
returning to society, but they were fascinated with what happened when those 
rituals failed, when violence spilled over into everyday life, and that 
aberrant behavior often provided grist for the Oliver Stones of the day, the 
playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Greeks were unique in creating the theater as a place where you could 
talk about and dramatize actions you couldn't deal with anywhere else," says 
Ferenga. "Murder and sexual crimes between family members -- fratricide, 
matricide, infanticide, incest. The worst crimes possible are in those 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
 What distinguishes those plays from today's news and dramatic programming is 
that Greeks didn't allow acts of violence themselves to be seen, for fear they 
would arouse excitement and prompt imitative behavior. Ferenga said that a riot 
at one Greek play based on a contemporary event nipped a budding 
movie-of-the-week mentality, and from then on, playwrights stuck to myths and 
metaphors. 
</P>
<P>
 Plato, beating the Rev. Donald Wildmon to the punch by more than 2,300 years, 
argued that theater and storytelling should be banned altogether, lest they 
provoke feelings and passions detrimental to society and rational thought. If 
he could see us now. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Plato would certainly feel that this is the ultimate end of reasonable and 
civilized life," Ferenga laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancient societies were state-run, of course. If free enterprise had been 
allowed to flourish, and they had their own dueling "Current Affairs" and 
National Enquirers paying witnesses and buying news, who knows how much sooner 
we might have met Mickey and Mallory? 
</P>
<P>
 What's new right now, other than the fact that we can watch dramatic events 
unfold in real time, with the outcomes unknown ("Will O.J. shoot himself or 
not?"), is that the media are beginning to examine and exploit themselves. 
Besides "Natural Born Killers," there was the recent Belgian film "Man Bites 
Dog," a pseudo-documentary about a film crew that follows a serial killer on 
his rounds and becomes his eager accomplice, and this fall we'll see the 
release of "S.F.W.," a movie about a man who is caught in, and changed by, a 
media-covered hostage crisis in a convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist Todd Gitlin, who teaches a course in the structure of mass 
communications at UC Berkeley, says that these films are part of a new "culture 
industry" thriving on self-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Academics get off on studying them," he says; "you and I get off on writing 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it has been fun, and our thanks to Oliver Stone for providing the 
opportunity. Just one more thing, though. Stone and his producers say that the 
great irony and strength of "Natural Born Killers" is that audiences end up 
rooting for Mickey and Mallory because the forces lined up against them -- that 
is, the rest of society -- are so corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that America doesn't produce many traditional heroes anymore, and 
that a hero without an agent is soon forgotten. It's also true that a society 
largely committed to the cults of celebrity and wealth is easily seduced. 
Still, the vast majority of Americans are appalled by crime and criminals, as 
the vast majorities of civilized societies always have, and they will be 
appalled by Mickey and Mallory. 
</P>
<P>
 With apologies to Oscar Wilde and Oliver Stone, there is a wide gulf between 
innate curiosity and devil worship.*

ART; THE LOST ART OF PORTRAITS; PRETTY HARD TO PICTURE YOURSELF IN A GRAND 
PORTRAIT OVER THE FIREPLACE? WELL, THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY TO GO. HOW TODAY'S 
ARTISTS ARE REDEFINING THE MEDIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This is a story about an embattled art form that refuses to die. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject? Portraiture. 
</P>
<P>
 True, it isn't what it used to be. Photography and electronic technology have 
made images of people so plentiful that the notion of having a portrait 
laboriously painted or sculpted seems a bit archaic. Portraiture has also taken 
a hit from 20th-Century guilt. Unless you move in certain rarefied social 
circles, it just isn't cool to glorify yourself in a grand portrait over the 
fireplace. Furthermore, artists themselves often shy away from creating 
commissioned likenesses, except as a means of supporting their art of choice. 
Even those who customarily portray people don't necessarily conceive of their 
work as portraiture or accept portrait commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 But portraiture lives. Indeed it's nearly ubiquitous. You just have to know 
where to look. 
</P>
<P>
 Check out the scene at Paris Photo Lab on La Cienega Boulevard, where members 
of the Los Angeles Macintosh Group's Fine Art SIG (Special Interest Group) are 
watching a demonstration by artist Jeremy Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't make computer art. I'm not even interested in computer art," Sutton 
says. "What I'm after is expression. It's the feeling and the passion that's 
the key. I just happened to find this unusual tool that expresses what I want." 
</P>
<P>
 If Sutton's protestations disappoint his audience of aspiring 
techno-Rembrandts, you'd never know it. All eyes are fixed on a bright pink 
triangle that flutters across an illuminated screen as Sutton clicks an 
electronic mouse and moves a stylus across a pressure-sensitive tablet. 
Selecting colors, materials and textures from a software program projected on 
the right side of the screen, he begins a digital portrait of Bruce Wallace, a 
model recruited from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually home in on the eyes first," Sutton says. As he draws on the tablet 
a blue line appears on the left side of the screen and turns into a life-like 
eye. Then he sketches Wallace's glasses with a wiry line and fleshes out the 
face with soft strokes of color -- while confessing to seduction by technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might ask why I use a computer for creating art, why bother to drag 
around all this equipment just to make a drawing," says Sutton, who lives in 
Palo Alto. "The answer is the unique possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The computer allows him to record his drawing sessions, play them back and 
print any stage of the work as a finished piece or as part of a collage, he 
explains. Furthermore, computer art can be enlarged and printed on a wide range 
of materials -- including canvas, vinyl, Mylar and watercolor paper. 
Banner-size images -- like the portraits of artists Pablo Picasso and Salvador 
Dali he has put on display -- require too much time and equipment to print on 
the spot, but Paris Photo Lab owner Arnaud Gregori soon appears with prints of 
the Wallace portrait, instantly produced on photography paper. 
</P>
<P>
 This is state-of-the-art portraiture, and it could hardly be otherwise in the 
digital age. Offering infinite opportunities to combine and rework hand-drawn 
or borrowed images, electronic methods of making art are irresistible -- as 
magazine illustrations, CD-ROM covers, art exhibitions and computer trade fairs 
attest. Sutton, who was educated as a physicist but has always considered 
himself an artist, recently quit his computer-industry sales job to become a 
full-time artist. When he isn't on the road demonstrating his skills, he 
produces commissioned portraits and illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, computer technology hasn't exactly transformed the conventions of 
creating human likenesses. It merely provides one more option to people in 
search of visual records or immortality. The notion of preserving oneself in a 
marble bust or a bronze medal may have fallen from favor, but many time-tested 
approaches to portraiture persist even as new developments proliferate. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Consider Portraits Inc.'s Park Avenue showroom in New York. Here -- in a cozy, 
old-fashioned gallery, conveniently located two blocks east of the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art -- visitors peruse examples of work by 175 artists and 
contemplate how they and their children, pets, houses and cars might be 
portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Choices range from small pencil drawings to life-size oils in various styles, 
priced from $2,000 to $150,000, but nearly all the images radiate a sense of 
health, prosperity and accomplishment. Stately Supreme Court justices in black 
robes, energetic business executives poised for action, elegant women in their 
gardens and freshly scrubbed children appear to belong to the same club, if 
only because they are important or confident enough to have their portraits 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 Portraits Inc.'s clients choose artists after consultation in person or by 
telephone, according to company president Marian MacKinney. "We often spend a 
good hour to an hour and a half trying to figure out what they want," she says. 
"We make their life difficult in the beginning, so they get something they will 
be happy with. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a question of what's appropriate," MacKinney says. "But most 
people want to look a little younger and more attractive. That goes with the 
territory. They want to look five years younger and five pounds lighter. It's 
not that much of a fib." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Southern California, where tradition is said to be a foreign 
concept, a more adventurous portrait consulting firm has been established by 
three enterprising women: Barbara Guggenheim, a New York-Los Angeles art 
consultant with strong ties to Hollywood; Barbara Pallenberg, an expert in 
Impressionist painting and founding director of Sotheby's Beverly Hills who 
left the firm last year and Christine Eisenberg, a Los Angeles associate of 
Sotheby's. Operating as Portraits by Artists Inc. in Beverly Hills, the 
partners offer the services of a wide range of artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Flipping through sample books in their Maple Drive office, Pallenberg and 
Guggenheim survey a roster including Nelson Shanks' flattering interpretation 
of Ronald Reagan and Aaron Shikler's glamorous socialites as well as Sylvia 
Shap's unflinching realism, Patrick Morrison's gritty Expressionism, Jon 
Swihart's impeccable period pieces and Sutton's digital art. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's promotional material also touts gift portraits in the form of 
cartoons, caricatures, banners, photographs of houses, bronze sculptures of 
racehorses and watercolors of gardens or favorite rooms. Novelty items run as 
low as $300, while the general price range for portraits starts at $700 for a 
photograph or drawing and jumps as high as $150,000 or $200,000 for a life-size 
painting by a major artist. The majority of commissions run from around $5,000 
to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the artists represented by Portraits by Artists Inc. make their 
living by doing portraits, Pallenberg says. For the rest, portraiture is a 
sideline that offers undeniable rewards -- not least of which is money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do portraits because I like to get paid for my work," says Rodney Buice, a 
Los Angeles-based artist whose silk-screen portraits were inspired by Andy 
Warhol. Among his completed projects are 19 likenesses of contemporary art 
collector Frederick R. Weisman and his second wife, Billie Milam Weisman, 
commissioned for the couple's homes and for several Weisman-supported museums. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Dan McCleary, who uses his friends as models in his figurative 
paintings, commissioned portraits are something he only agrees to "in weak 
moments" or when money is especially tight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Portraiture has always been something artists could fall back on," says 
Clayton Campbell, who has completed 30 portraits in the last three years. Known 
for narrative figurative paintings with social or political themes, he 
inadvertently launched himself in a new direction by producing a magazine 
illustration for an article on migraine headaches. For that commission he 
manipulated photographic images of four women so they appeared to be in pain. 
Despite the off-putting subject matter, Campbell was suddenly in demand by 
clients who wanted portraits done in the same style. 
</P>
<P>
 In his current work -- including a group portrait of Guggenheim, Pallenberg 
and Eisenberg -- he takes photographs of his subjects, alters and prints 
several different images on paper, then affixes the prints to canvas in a grid 
arrangement and adds painted details. Calling his work "expressionistic 
distortion," he aims to reveal his subjects through a composite view. "I ask my 
subjects to go on an adventure with me," Campbell says. The challenge of 
plunging into a field that's so laden with history is to "use a visual language 
that adds to the genre in a positive way," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 John Nava, who is well known for figurative paintings, has found unexpected 
pleasure in portraits. Although he has long tested his powers of observation by 
representing his models precisely, he never thought of his work as portraiture. 
But recently he has accepted portrait commissions with satisfying results. "I 
think my portrait of Catherine Hillman is one of the best things I've done," he 
says of his painting of the 8-year-old daughter of Pop musician Chris Hillman. 
</P>
<P>
 If lucrative commissions and serendipity lure artists to portraiture, it's 
often the psychological element that gets them hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought doing portraits until I found out how much fun they are," says Nic 
Nicosia, a nationally known photographer who lives in Dallas. He draws a sharp 
distinction between his portraits and the psychologically charged scenes that 
compose his main body of work. "Portraits are about them and a lot about how 
they look," he says, referring to his subjects. "The rest of my work is about 
me, or something I've observed or heard or read." But the bonus of portraiture 
is that people reveal themselves in unexpected ways and those revelations 
enrich his other work, Nicosia says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Shap, who cringes when she's labeled a portrait artist but devotes 
herself to the artform, says her commissioned works often become symbolic 
quests for dream fulfillment. "I feel like I'm a psychologist," she says. A 
sheltered child of Holocaust survivors, Shap initially drew herself as a means 
of self knowledge. Now her favorite clients are those "who don't fault me 
because they have a wart," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say, I don't make 'em, I just paint 'em," Shap quips. Nonetheless, 
she has lots of stories to share. There's the one about the battered woman who 
posed in a frilly set, with the bruised side of her face turned to the wall. 
The man who rented a Napoleon costume for his portrait and redecorated his 
house to match the painting. The teen-age boy who grew up and thanked Shap for 
allowing him to discover himself in a portrait that his parents hated. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's portrait artists have found a niche in a tradition that has changed 
dramatically since the invention of the camera. Indeed, American portraiture 
was almost synonymous with painting until the 1850s and '60s, when photography 
became all the rage, according to Michael Quick, former chief curator of 
American art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. During those decades, 
artists who continued to paint portraits tried to make their work look like 
stiff photographs. "That's why there are no good paintings of Abraham Lincoln, 
only photographs," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Portrait painting enjoyed a vigorous revival in America, beginning in the 
1870s and reaching its zenith in the 1890s but dying out at the end of the 
1920s. "There was a tremendous boom during the Romantic period, when 
individuality was highly prized," Quick says. "Portraits flourished around the 
turn of century, in the era of the robber barons. It was part of the 
ostentation of the period, when people began to live in palaces." 
</P>
<P>
 A champion of portrait painting, Quick organized two exhibitions for LACMA in 
the early 1980s, "American Portraiture in the Grand Manner, 1720-1920" and 
"Artists By Themselves: Artists Portraits From the National Academy of Design." 
He had hoped to stimulate interest in historic portraits and in collecting 
them, but the effort failed. "Portraits give you all the textures of still 
life, plus a personality," he says, but few collectors seem to be interested in 
paintings of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures of themselves are another matter, however. Collectors frequently 
commission portraits or agree to pose for artists whose work they admire -- and 
eventually buy the resulting artworks. Moreover, artists not known for 
portraiture naturally turn to their collectors when they venture into the 
territory. New York photographer William Wegman's primary subjects are his 
Weimaraners, but when he focuses his giant Polaroid camera on people they are 
often collectors of his work. 
</P>
<P>
 F. Scott Hess, a Los Angeles-based artist, persuaded 32 of his collectors and 
an equal number of friends to pose individually for an ambitious project that 
he carried out in 1992. The wall-size installation of 18x24-inch images, "Your 
Face or Mine: Work in Progress," has been exhibited in full at the Ovsey 
Gallery and in part at other locations, including a recent show at the Louis 
Newman Gallery in Beverly Hills. The expressionistic images are not 
particularly flattering, but 26 of the collectors have purchased their 
portraits. 
</P>
<P>
 They are in good company. Peter and Eileen Norton, who are among Hess' 
subjects, have been photographed by Richard Schulman and painted by Shap, 
McCleary and Don Bachardy. Eli and Edythe Broad's vast collection of 
contemporary art includes a portrait of the couple by the late photographer 
Robert Mapplethorpe. In addition to the 19 portraits he ordered from Buice, 
Weisman has been painted by Warhol and he appears with his first wife, the late 
Marcia Weisman, in David Hockney's 1968 painting, "American Collectors." 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible, as Quick suggests, that palatial homes built in the profligate 
1980s have replaced portraits as they proclaim their owners' importance. And -- 
since life drawing is considered a rather quaint skill in most art schools -- 
it seems unlikely that the grand portrait painting he so admires will ever 
return in force. 
</P>
<P>
 But portraiture is such an enduring artform that five countries -- England, 
Scotland, Australia, France, Sweden and the United States -- have established 
museums on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original impetus for our National Portrait Gallery in Washington was to 
celebrate the past, not just through dates and events but to recognize what 
people have done," says gallery director Alan Fern. "Portraiture is a kind of 
visual biography. It offers insight into people's personalities as well as a 
map of their features. It has the dual quality of being an interesting work of 
art and a revelation about a person." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can gaze into the countenances of heroes and scoundrels alike, he 
says, noting that the gallery has a painting of Jesse James as well as George 
Washington. It also offers images of famous Americans whose faces are little 
known, such as John James Audubon and Noah Webster. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1962 as a branch of the Smithsonian Institution, the gallery opened 
in 1968 in the U.S. Patent Office Building, one of the capital's oldest 
structures. Though comparatively young, the collection contains about 12,000 
works, of which 600-700 are on view.  
</P>
<P>
 Initially the gallery wasn't authorized to collect photographs, but it soon 
became apparent that a comprehensive portrait collection couldn't be built 
without photography, Fern says. The gallery's mandate was changed, and he now 
takes pride in the collection's diversity. Although the Hall of Presidents, 
featuring conventional paintings, is the gallery's most popular exhibit, the 
collection also boasts a hologram of Ronald Reagan, he notes. Furthermore, the 
gallery has hosted shows of photographic portraits by Richard Avedon, Irving 
Penn and Arnold Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ongoing effort to keep the National Portrait Gallery up to date, Fern is 
hoping to move into the area of video portraits. "We don't have a screening 
area yet, but that's one of my targets," he says. As for computer art, he has 
an open mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquiring portraits of any kind is first of all "a question of artistic 
validity," he says. "But we don't lead. The artists lead us."

A LIVING WORK IN PROGRESS; CHARLAYNE WOODARD HAS BEEN THROUGH THE MILL OF TV 
AND MOVIES. SHE CAME OUT BATTERED, BUT WISER. THE WISDOM SEEMS TO HAVE HELPED 
HER TACKLE HER COMPLEX ROLE IN 'GOOD PERSON OF SETZUAN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Breslauer, Jan Breslauer is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlayne Woodard perches on the edge of her chair, her bright yellow silk 
skirt draped between dancer's legs. Her toned arms make sweeping gestures, her 
smile and eyes are impossibly wide and her laugh is an infectious cackle. 
</P>
<P>
 She's almost got the Spunky Girl Heroine persona down cold. But then, 
ebullient as she may be one minute, she's contemplative the next. 
</P>
<P>
 That yin-yang comes in handy. These days, Woodard plays two characters of 
different temper and gender in the Tony Kushner adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's 
"The Good Person of Setzuan" at the La Jolla Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The parable tells the tale of a prostitute named Shen Te -- whom the gods deem 
the one good person on earth -- and her alter ego, a male cousin she 
masquerades as named Shui Ta. Woodard spends most of the play's three hour-plus 
running time onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed somebody with a larger-than-life personality who was giant onstage, 
has power and could grasp the humor," says director Lisa Peterson of her lead 
actor. "She has a huge presence. She's a perfectionist. She actually transforms 
her worries into positive things." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as much of a positivist as Woodard may be, she's never been carefree. 
"Theater was my life, my church, my everything," says the veteran actress, who 
appeared in the original Broadway company of "Ain't Misbehavin'," of her New 
York days. "I was obsessed. I didn't have the capacity to be a good friend, a 
good sister or the kind of daughter I would like to be and do my jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 All wasn't solved when Woodard took the trek west five years ago. "When I 
moved to Los Angeles and went to the first auditions, I thought I would slit my 
wrists," she says. "The mistake that I made was that I complained a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem here hasn't been a surfeit of work, but a dearth of the right 
stuff. "Rarely do you get something that makes you say, 'I have to work on 
this,' " says Woodard. "The roles for me that are wonderful are so few and far 
between, and they tend to (cast) the same people over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 And while roles are even fewer for actresses of color, Woodard is loath to 
blame it on race. "One thing I've never done is that thing of saying that 
because I'm black, this is not given to me," she says. "I always feel that my 
being an African American woman is an asset and that's what I take into my 
meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 What's unusual about Woodard is not her predicament but her remedy. "I said, 
'No more lamentations, Charlayne. Create for yourself. Join your theater 
groups. That's the thing that drives you to write.' I will never stop doing 
theater, never. The new challenge is, 'Can I make a living in film and 
television?' It's a different animal altogether. And I've stopped beating that 
animal. You've got to get on it and ride it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard is best known to L.A. audiences for her 1992 one-woman show "Pretty 
Fire," which premiered at Hollywood's Fountainhead Theatre, went on to run at 
New York's Manhattan Theatre Club and is about to be published by Penguin 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
 An autobiographical solo focusing on the first 11 years of the actress's life, 
"Pretty Fire" was Woodard's first writing venture. She did not, however, set 
out to create a long-running show, nor even one for public consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 Her motive was anything but showcasing. "I did the one-woman show because of 
my frustration, because I realized that I'd been in L.A. and I hadn't worked," 
says Woodard. "I had jobs. I made enough to support myself. But I didn't feel 
like I'd gotten a workout." 
</P>
<P>
 So Woodard cut a deal with the Fountainhead, a 99-seat house on Hollywood's 
theater row, that in return for her appearance in a play, she would have the 
chance to use the theater for her own purposes later on. On closing night of 
the play, "Out of Our Father's House," she reminded the theater of their 
agreement and found that the calendar was wide open. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Show us your play and we'll talk,' " says Woodard. "And I didn't 
have a play! So in a week I put together my stories. Then I started rehearsal. 
I had the keys to the theater and worked around the clock. It was an incredible 
experience. I still can't put it into words." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard didn't even want press coverage. "I did it as a work-in-progress, only 
for my own personal workout," says Woodard. "I even told the Fountainhead, 'No 
critics.' But after a few performances I said, 'OK, just promise me you won't 
read anything to me.' It never occurred to me that people would get into it. 
But it worked, to my absolute surprise and shock." 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty Fire" details the actress's Albany, N.Y., youth, from her precarious, 
premature birth through girlhood. In it, the actress, who refuses to reveal her 
age, portrays not only a younger version of herself, but also an array of other 
characters, including her own parents and sundry neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a notably sunny five-part tale -- by contrast with most autobiographical 
solo shows -- although Woodard also depicts such disturbing experiences as 
trips down South in which she saw crosses burned. Still, the overall picture 
Woodard paints is upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to imagine the girl of "Pretty Fire" taking a relatively quick 
road to success once a high school teacher piqued her interest in theater. 
Woodard went on to train at Chicago's Goodman Theatre, and then went straight 
from there to New York, without even waiting for her graduation ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived in New York in the summer of 1977, Equity card already in hand, 
and within two weeks had landed a Broadway show -- "Ain't Misbehavin'," for 
which she garnered both Tony and Drama Desk nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 And Woodard just kept working, collecting such Off-Broadway credits as 
"Twelfth Night" at the New York Shakespeare Festival and the lead role in 
George C. Wolfe's staging of Brecht's "The Caucasian Chalk Circle." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her stage gigs, Woodard also made occasional trips to 
California. "People would come to New York and audition me, and I'd get a job 
and come out here and work," she says. "So I only knew L.A. as a person with a 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 She was one of the lucky few New York actors who was actually making a living 
onstage. "New York worked for me for a long time," says Woodard. "But for most 
of my friends, it didn't, so they left right away." 
</P>

 Some of those actor friends who left landed in Los Angeles, where the work was 
more plentiful, at least during the 1980s. "I'd come out here and they'd be 
living up on big mountains, doing well in film and television," says Woodard. 
"And I thought, 'Here I am working eight shows a week -- I mean working -- and 
they have weekends off.' So I thought, 'Maybe it's time for me to do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard, who is married to attorney-screenwriter Alan Harris -- the man who 
took her to her high school senior prom -- moved to Los Angeles in 1989. "I saw 
that there was more to life than eight shows a week," she says. "I did that 
L.A. thing that we all laugh about, getting in touch with your spirituality. My 
whole value system changed." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, she decided to go cold turkey on stage work. "When I first came 
here, I decided I would leave theater behind," she says. "I didn't even want to 
go do any regional theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Woodard soon found she missed the boards, from the first step of the 
process on. "What I love about when you audition for theater is that time is 
spent," she says. There's a fine actor who reads with you. Then the director 
stops you and gives actable direction and the atmosphere is such that work can 
be done in the audition." 
</P>
<P>
 She also has confidence in a fair outcome. "In New York, you go into the 
audition and you know that no matter what, whoever did the best audition -- no 
matter who knows her or who doesn't know her -- she's the diva, she got the 
job. And you bow to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Auditioning here in Los Angeles, however, is another matter. "(With film and 
TV auditions) you sit there and do this thing for two minutes and you leave," 
she says. "Sometimes it feels like a rape. In L.A., you won't get a job for 
every other reason besides you were not working well that day. And you will get 
a job for every reason besides you were working well." 
</P>
<P>
 But Woodard is not a quitter. "I decided to make the adjustment," she says. "I 
decided, 'OK, Woodard, you're the one who said "I would like to try and tackle 
film and television," Accept it. Act like you're in Paris and just be as 
Parisian as you possibly can.' And as soon as I changed my mind-set, I started 
to live in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 It worked, although not yet as fully as Woodard would have liked. She did a 
1991-92 stint on the soap "Days of Our Lives" and has had recurring roles on 
"Roseanne" and "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." She has also had roles in films, 
including "One Good Cop," "Meteor Man" and the recent "Babyfever." 
</P>
<P>
 And after a few years, Woodard also rescinded her ban on the theater. "In the 
beginning, you're just young and ignorant and foolish, and you set up these 
rules because you're protecting yourself," says Woodard. "That's what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 She gave the regional stage a go and liked it. In 1985 she played Beneatha in 
"A Raisin in the Sun" at the Philadelphia Drama Guild. She also appeared in the 
1986 La Jolla Playhouse production of the musical "Shout Up a Morning," 
directed by Des McAnuff. "Everyone said, 'You must go to La Jolla. It's like 
the South of France.' And I realized there was something to working outside of 
New York. Theater is theater." She went with "Shout Up a Morning" when it 
traveled to the Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been demanding parts, but perhaps none so much as her current dual 
role. Playing Shen Te/Shui Ta would already be twice the workload of a normal 
part, even if the script weren't so long. "The main challenge of this role was 
the time factor," says Woodard. "This play was (originally) four hours long. 
You have a four-week rehearsal period. Normally in four weeks you rehearse a 
two-hour play." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the matter of Brechtian acting -- the playwright's own stated 
preference for an un-emotive performance style. "I chose to try and make two 
three-dimensional characters, as opposed to just indicating them," says 
Woodard. "When you're surrounded by all that representation, there's room to be 
human." 
</P>
<P>
 Her strategy is to avoid being "too intellectual" about what's Brechtian and 
what's not. "Immediately in the rehearsal process, directors start putting all 
that stuff on you," says Woodard. "You don't even have a person yet, but there 
you are with all that Brecht business. Then it's up to you to handle it all." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the only actor (who auditioned) who even approached the ability to 
play Shui Ta," says "Setzuan" director Peterson, who has been associate 
director at the La Jolla Playhouse for the past three summers. "We came up with 
some prototypes from her life -- some strange Detroit uncle of hers (for 
example) -- for her characters and she works quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's fearless," Peterson continues. "She would do anything in rehearsal. She 
didn't balk at smoking a cigar. She's a team player, very generous. She's 
primarily a technician, although she does also have this secret process to fill 
something out. It may be because she's a musician (a singer), she learns to 
play the notes first and then figures out all the other stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically enough, the conscien tiously upbeat Woodard finds a kinship with 
the famously cynical Brecht. She is drawn to the moral impulses and imperatives 
underlying the action. 
</P>
<P>
 For Woodard's money, the playwright said one thing about his plays -- namely 
that they were not about such human emotions as compassion, but strictly 
Marxist in their analysis -- and wrote quite another. "Brecht gives his actors 
such a journey," says Woodard. "He likes to say, 'Do this, do that,' but he has 
you say things that mean so much -- like the speech about, 'You'll never find 
more reliable tenants than people who've been at the bottom of the barrel.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It is a poignant truth that hits home with Woodard. "I know about that," she 
says. "Those things mean so much to me. I come from a people who've just been 
reaching for centuries." 
</P>
<P>
 The message that Woodard hears is one of care and cooperation. "In the end, 
the gods just sort of abandon this person who needs help," she says. "But 
(Brecht) wants us to focus on each other and get our strength from each other. 
That's interesting to me, because I'm pretty religious." 
</P>
<P>
 But then again, ethical concerns are central to Woodard's theater work. She 
did not, after all, write "Pretty Fire" only to stretch some artistic muscle. 
She was also spurred on by the sad state of racial relations in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard believes her adopted home is a dangerously divided city. "I would go 
to these dinner parties and realize that the place was so segregated that the 
people who were there didn't know anybody like me," she says. "I would be in a 
room full of artists and I'd realize I was the only woman of color there. In 
New York, when you get a group of artists together, the whole world is there. 
But that wasn't happening in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The picture can be particularly monochromatic in the entertainment industry 
and other elite circles -- including the tony bistros in which deals are 
brokered. "Where are the black waiters and waitresses?" asks the actress. 
"There are none in a certain area -- a huge area. This segregation has really 
kept everybody apart and that's why there's so much madness. Nobody knows 
anyone. You see them drive by in their Lexus, but nobody's coming together." 
</P>
<P>
 So Woodard wrote her solo in order to show audiences an aspect of American 
culture other than their own. "If I hadn't moved to Los Angeles, I would never 
have written 'Pretty Fire,' " she says. "There would have been no need." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a project she intends to continue. "I'm writing more, not necessarily for 
myself," says Woodard of her current effort, a play with four characters. "I 
use my life because I've had a very rich one, but this time I probably won't 
even say it's autobiographical. I try not to think too much about what I'm 
doing, because when I intellectualize, it gets in the way of my process. When I 
treat life as if it's an improv, it's much more rewarding." Vital Stats

 When Selena Quintanilla was a 14-year-old seasoned performer grinding out 
one-nighters in the cantinas, nightclubs and back-yard weddings of southern 
Texas, her ambitions were writ in miniature: a better gig than the current one, 
a bigger local record company to sign with. Maybe a chance with an even larger 
company if things really went well. "We just wanted to put food on the table," 
she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Selena -- as she is known -- now contents herself with much more. Her last 
release, "Amor Prohibido," has sold nearly 400,000 copies in five months. She 
and her band sometimes play in 60,000-seat stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a Grammy-winning artist (this year, for best Mexican/American album for 
"Selena Live") with the giant EMI Latin Records, and she owns the 
standard-issue, amenity-laden tour bus. It's charcoal gray, rides 15 and is 
outfitted with chrome mag wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, though, Selena and her band, Los Dinos, have become, over the 
course of five major releases, the biggest stars of the Spanish-language music 
known as Tejano. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm freaking out on all the excitement," confesses Selena, 23. (See 
accompanying story, page 71.) 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually unheard of outside Texas until a few years ago, Tejano in a sudden 
burst has become the country's fastest-growing genre of Spanish-language music, 
according to Arelis Diaz, editor of Radio & Musica, a Tampa-based magazine for 
Spanish-language music. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is just now finding nationwide distribution and airplay, Tejano 
music today is a $35-million annual market that is being played full time on 70 
radio stations in the United States and on hundreds more as part of 
Spanish-language play lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Such major record labels as EMI, Sony and Venezuela-based Rodven all have 
burgeoning rosters of Tejano acts, while Arista has devoted an entire division 
-- Arista Texas -- to the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March's annual Tejano Music Awards show in San Antonio -- sponsored in 
part by Coca-Cola, Ford and General Mills -- reportedly cost more than $3 
million and was televised in 120 countries. It began 13 years ago as a local 
show with a $15,000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tejano is growing by the minute," said Manolo Gonzales, an EMI Latin vice 
president. "A 20,000-seller was considered a big hit five years ago. Now Selena 
sells 200,000 the first week." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The word Tejano is simply "Texan" in Spanish, and refers to a person born in 
Texas of Mexican ancestry. The music Tejano is a Texas-bred descendant of 
"Tex-Mex," the stalwart border genre that blends traditional Mexican music with 
German polka.  
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, it has grown up in the last decade and a half around San Antonio and 
border towns, nurtured by younger Mexican Americans who, born and raised in the 
United States, extended and transformed that tradition by infusing it with 
technology, relatively slick production and a natural familiarity with American 
pop music. 
</P>
<P>
 "This used to be the stuff our parents listened to," said Tejano musician 
Emilio Navaira, who is currently in Nashville recording a country-Tejano album. 
"(But) the new generation has caught on. This is the new Tex-Mex sound." Says 
Selena: "It's what Top 40 is to Anglos." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is also Tex-Mex with a difference. The Tejano genre has grown nearly as 
roomy as the Lone Star State itself -- encompassing influences such as country, 
rock and urban -- to the point where Tejano often is just a signature for 
musicians linked by Latin heritage and the fact of their making 
border-influenced music couched in an American sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite common origins, there is little on the surface to tie the 
polished radio pop of Selena with the soft-rock and country of Navaira to the 
international-in fluenced stylings of La Diferenzia. But it all fits 
comfortably onto a Tejano radio format, which can also include recent releases 
by Tex-Mex legends such as Freddy Fender, Flaco Jimenez and Little Joe, all of 
whom also now ride under the Tejano banner. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of different styles under the name Tejano," said Jesse Rios, 
operations and program director at KXTN-FM, which has become the No. 1 radio 
station in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Tejano artist can go up on stage and do a cumbia , a country song, a Top 40 
song and a ranchera. " Agrees Navaira: "I can play rock and I can play country 
and then I can go back to my polkas."  
</P>
<P>
 So far, that broad spectrum has worked mostly to Tejano's ad vantage. Not only 
has the music established beachheads in such least-likely states as Idaho, 
Indiana, Kansas and Michigan, but it has also won fans internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas once the range of clubs for successful Tejano artists was 
circumscribed in the Texas triangle of Dallas, Houston and San Antonio, now 
artists are scheduling tours in the Caribbean and Central and South America, 
where an increasing number of stations are playing Tejano hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Selena y Los Dinos will debut this year in New York and Los Angeles (where 
they play the Universal Amphitheatre on Thursday) as well as Argentina and 
Puerto Rico. La Mafia, another popular group, likewise has toured the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United Sates, Tejano already has begun to edge out other 
Spanish-language radio formats in terms of popularity. Radio & Musica editor 
Diaz says that Tejano is now the second-most played format on Spanish-language 
radio, behind "regional Mexican," some of which incorporates Tejano music 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Diaz says Radio & Musica doesn't track all the radio stations 
nationwide that play Tejano. "There are more that want to report (to us), but 
we don't have room," she said. "I compare this to the country music boom." 
</P>
<P>
 At KXTN-FM, it was the switch over to Tejano in March, 1990, that powered the 
100,000-watt station to the top of the heap among San Antonio radio stations 
after just nine months. "This was a sleeping giant," said Rios. "San Antonio 
was a major, major Tejano town ready to boom." 
</P>
<P>
 Rios, however, says that KXTN's sudden leap to prominence was not due solely 
to the music. In fact, at the time the station switched formats, another 
station had already been playing Tex-Mex and Tejano for years with little 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rios said that before switching to Tejano, KXTN management made a decision 
to market it to a younger audience, people who might normally be discomfited to 
listen to what they considered to be "their parents' music," and who would 
otherwise be listening to English-language radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted it to be a hip, cool station," said Rios, who characterized 
traditional Spanish-language radio as "embarrassing" for younger Latinos to 
listen to. "I want a guy to drive up to a red light and see a cute girl and be 
jamming to Mazz and La Mafia and not to turn it down. It's proud, loud."  
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, in Los Angeles, where the No. 1 rated station for the last 18 
months has also been Spanish-language, executives at KLAX-FM say they have no 
plan to deviate from their hugely popular regional format of banda , nortena 
and ranchera music to include Tejano. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing against Tex-Mex," said program director Juan Carlos Hidalgo, "but 
it's not part of our format. We don't think there's a market (for it)." 
</P>
<P>
 Tejano music executives acknowledge that the West Coast, especially the Los 
Angeles market, has been tough to crack because of listener loyalty to regional 
music. As a result, they have taken two tacks: either trying to promote artists 
on an individual basis and playing down their Tejano affiliation, or trying to 
find success first for them on Mexican radio, which often dictates taste for 
local stations.  
</P>
<P>
 Some artists recognize the quandary of being hemmed in by their success under 
the label of Tejano when it comes to certain markets. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mafia began more than a decade ago as a straight-ahead Tejano band that 
found itself eventually selling upward of 70,000 units per release. But band 
members were dissatisfied. "It was hard to expand," said Mando Lichtenberger, 
the group's accordionist and keyboardist. "When you reach the top of the Tejano 
market, there's really nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
 After signing with Sony three years ago, however, La Mafia began writing a 
different story. Changing its style to feature more soft pop and ballads, La 
Mafia released two records that sold nearly 1 million copies worldwide apiece, 
and a single, "Me Estoy Enamorando," that topped the charts in Puerto Rico. 
Already, the group's latest release for Sony, "Vida," has sold 500,000 copies 
in four months. 
</P>
<P>
 'We had to find a style of music that was popular in Texas as well as the West 
Coast," said Lichtenberger, who fairly bristles both at the idea of La Mafia 
being known solely as a Tejano band and at much of the music now being marketed 
as Tejano. "They say you're Tejano even though your music isn't. People just 
have to accept that it's not Tejano." 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledges Jose Behar, president of EMI Latin: "Once it leaves Texas, it 
isn't pure Tejano. For some of these artists, to be identified as Tejano would 
be a misnomer." 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, for some, the tables of identity get turned when they reach a 
critical mass of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Selena, who readily identifies herself as a Tejano artist, says that many 
radio programmers and executives don't perceive her as such. She takes it in 
stride and as an endorsement of her musical diversity. "It's a compliment when 
people just don't define me a pure Tejano, even though I am," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, then, the most unifying element among Tejano groups and musicians is 
the fact of their culture: dually American and Latin, unlike musicians of other 
Spanish-language genres, most of whom were raised outside the United States and 
whose first language usually was not English. Even some of Tejano's Tex-Mex 
predecessors were born in Mexico and grew up first speaking Spanish in 
exclusively Latino cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tejano artists feel more comfortable in English -- it's their language," said 
EMI Latin's Gonzales. "When I go with Selena to Mexico, it's a problem because 
she doesn't understand half of what's being said." 
</P>
<P>
 Agrees George Reynoso, owner of All That Music, an El Paso music store that 
sells Tejano music: "When you grow up on the border, you have your own 
identity. You realize you're not completely Mexican, but you're not completely 
American either." 
</P>
<P>
 It's this ability to navigate both cultures, in addition to the steadily 
growing Latino presence in the U.S. population, say boosters, that makes the 
prospect of finding a crossover Tejano artist both a lucrative and distinct 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Label president Behar recalls that soon after he came to EMI, the company's 
then-head Joe Smith told him to "go out and find the next Gloria Estefan." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, Behar saw Selena perform at the Tejano Music Awards and 
signed her to EMI Latin -- ironically, at first for the English-language 
market. Selena's next album, scheduled for release in early 1995, will be her 
first in English and will be released on EMI's U.S. mainstream SBK label. She 
is the company's first female Latin crossover artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "This music is a breeding ground for that," said Behar, who got hooked on 
Tejano a decade ago following a midnight concert attended by 8,000 fans in a 
muddy field in a small Texas town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe crossover artists are going to come from salsa or from the 
Latin pop market. These artists are going to come from Tejano, where they grew 
up speaking the language."

RADIO; TRIUMPH OF THE SHOCK-NOTS; THIS MAY SURPRISE YOU, BUT KEN MINYARD AND 
ROGER BARKLEY HAVE THE TOP-RATED 5-9 A.M. SHOW IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN A 
WORLD INCREASINGLY DOMINATED BY HOWARD STERN AND HIS ILK, HOW DO THEY DO IT? 
THE ANSWERS WILL NOT SHOCK YOU. 
</P>

<P>
 On the local radio dial, easygoing banter seems to have more staying power 
than wild and wacky antics. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness the longstanding success of KABC-AM (790) morning duo Ken Minyard and 
Roger Barkley, who over the years have remained in the top five while many of 
their peers have peaked and dropped -- if not outrightly disappeared -- from 
the competitive world of morning drive-time. 
</P>
<P>
 Minyard has hosted the wakeup show at KABC for 21 years, most of them Bob 
Arthur. Longtime Los Angeles broadcaster Barkley, (who himself was partnered 
with Al Lohman for 25 years) joined Minyard after Arthur left the station four 
years ago. According to the Arbitron ratings, their show is the second most 
popular (behind Howard Stern) of all English language morning shows. But 
Arbitron defines "morning show" as 6-10 a.m. "The Ken and Barkely Company" 
actually averages a larger audience than anyone else the hours it airs, 5 
a.m.-9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You have the top-rat ed local morning show. Yet, your competition, 
like Howard Stern on KLSXand and KLOS' Mark and Brian, have seemed to get all 
the attention over the years. Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
 Minyard: People sort of take us for granted. I understand we've been around a 
long time, but I think Roger and I both feel we're probably doing our best work 
now. . . . If you look back, you'll see that over the past years we've been far 
and away the dominant show in the market. After all that time and with all the 
(competition), we have weathered the storm. Yes, it's frustrating for people 
not to acknowledge that. We went through (the successes of such other Los 
Angeles morning personalities as) Rick Dees, we went through Mark and Brian, 
and Jay Thomas had his day and so on. And we have stayed right there in the 
hunt. Big time. . . . Everybody said, "Radio is going in this trend: Shock 
jocks." Everybody hasn't gone that way. The other approach works too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What has the advent of shock radio done, if anything, to the nature of your 
show? 
</P>
<P>
 Minyard: The good side of it is it allows us to go further than we used to be 
able to go. You don't have to second-guess yourself on where the line is. 
Because wherever the line is, we don't even approach it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think has made your show so successful through the years? 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley: Spontaneity. You never know what's going to happen next. 
</P>
<P>
 Minyard: We never get bogged down. We don't have time to. We've got so many 
elements in our show. Also, we find it very easy to switch gears between being 
silly and serious. On any given day, in any half-hour, in one conversation, we 
can go from screwing around to getting into serious topics. And I think the 
fact that we can relate to that aspect of living as well as just being crazy 
morning men is unique. Most others are either comedy shows or talk shows. Ours 
is a combination, always keeping in mind that it's supposed to be 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think of your competition, specifically the top morning shows? 
</P>
<P>
 Minyard: I care about appealing to a reasonably intelligent audience that has 
a sense of humor. I don't think that all of them appeal to such an intelligent 
audience. I think Kevin and Bean (of KROQ-FM) are awfully good. . . . Rick Dees 
(of KIIS-AM/FM) is a good guy, too. Rush Limbaugh (of KFI-AM() is a phenomenon, 
but my problem with Limbaugh is I find I can tune in today and I don't have to 
listen to him for a couple weeks because I know it's going to be the same damn 
thing. He's gotten a certain formula: He goes off on Clinton, talks to the 
ditthoheads and he sells stuff. He's become a marketplace, more than anything 
else. . . . The thing I object to about Stern is how cruelty has come to be 
equated with humor and I don't find it very funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley: I tuned him in this morning when he had a bunch of women in 
undressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Minyard: Doesn't he do that every morning? If you hear that on a daily basis, 
how long can you find it funny? Is that really creative? Does that make him a 
humorist?

 Q: What direction do you think morning radio is going in?  
</P>
<P>
 Barkley: Stern's impact will be felt for years and years. Young people who 
want to get into radio who use him as a role model are going to take what he 
does even another step or two. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has talk radio changed over the years that you've been in it? 
</P>
<P>
 Minyard: First of all, I don't think of us as being in talk radio. We're a 
morning show. We certainly are part of the whole thing, but both of us have 
said on the air that we're kind of ashamed to be associated with it. Talk radio 
is getting to be not a very nice thing. Because on some radio stations it seems 
that they'll do anything to outdo the next guy. They don't seem to have a 
commitment to any real idea, but to do anything that will get them attention. 
So, they're just whores. And it didn't used to be that way. . . . I also don't 
like the trend at some stations to put down people because they're over 55 
years old. They're trying so desperately to appeal to this young, hip audience. 
There's nothing young and hip about you if you're constantly saying how young 
and hip you are. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley: On the good side, talk radio has caused a great resurgence of 
interest in AM radio. There was a time a few years ago where you would have 
written off AM radio stations as being virtually without value. We fought a 
losing battle with FM when everyone was playing records. Now, all of a sudden 
there's a great interest in the AM dial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has talk radio become more sensationalistic, or is it just dealing more 
openly with issues? 
</P>
<P>
 Minyard: I don't think it's just talk radio. It's the tabloidization of the 
media in general. I think it probably applies to television and print media as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley: Talk radio really is driven by the interests of the audience. You 
open the phone lines and say "Call about something" and chances are they'll 
call about O.J. Simpson. Where talk radio is really valuable is in times of a 
crisis. It provides a real outlet for people who have emotions they want to 
express to somebody. The earthquake is a really good example of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Minyard: We have a disaster-planning wing of the Ken and Barkley Company that 
tries to create various disasters in order to build ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which ones are you working on now, so I'll know and can brace myself? 
</P>
<P>
 Minyard: Pestilence. We haven't had any pestilence. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley: We think the L.A. River may become a raging torrent. 
</P>
<P>
 Minyard: And if it does, we're ready for it.

CITY ARTS: CIRCLE OF LIFE

 Pointing at a peace sign in the middle of a brilliantly colored, circular 
sand-painted mosaic, 14-year-old Melva Carter said she learned Buddhist 
principles by working alongside Buddhist monks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned compassion, kindness, respect and love," she said."By working with 
the monks, they show you how to share. They work with you with patience." 
</P>
<P>
 During a free four-week program at the Watts Towers Arts Center, the secrets 
of the Buddhist mandala -- circular graphic symbols depicting the totality of 
the universe that may date back to 600 BC -- are being shared with youths such 
as Melva. 
</P>
<P>
 In the program titled "Healing Violence Through Art," which began Aug. 2, 
three Tibetan Buddhist monks from the Namgyal Monastery in Ithaca, N.Y., are 
working with 100 5- to 16-year-olds. While the monks construct a traditional 
Wheel of Compassion, the youths have  
</P>
<P>
 been creating one of their own, painting images with colored sand that reflect 
their culture. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Buddhists, dismantling the mandalas is as important as creating them. 
On Aug. 30 at 11 a.m. -- after the mandalas have fulfilled their purpose, 
according to the monks -- the monks and the children will sweep away the 
colored sand. 
</P>
<P>
 For Buddhist monk Champa Lhuno, working with the youths has been a learning 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Asian countries, children are asked to copy. In Western countries, 
children are taught to create by themselves. Both are good, but this is another 
way of teaching," he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Healing Violence Through Art," through Aug. 30, Tuesday through Sunday, 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m.; Watts Towers Arts Center, 1727 E. 107th St.; free; (213) 
485-1795.

VOICES: BUILDING BLOCS; KAREN ESCALANTE PUSHES LATINOS TO PURSUE POLITICAL 
POWER THROUGH CITIZENSHIP DRIVES AND AN AWARENESS OF THEIR CLOUT AS VOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN ESCALANTE, Karen Escalante, 32, is the acting executive director of 
NALEOthe National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officialsa nonprofit, 
nonpartisan civic research and action group aimed at improving the lives of 
Latinos in the United States. The group, founded in the late 1970s, is based in 
Los Angeles and has offices nationwide. Escalante has been with NALEO for four 
years and was named acting executive director late last year. She was 
interviewed by Karen E. Klein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When NALEO started its work, we were concerned with the low voting rates among 
Latinos. Studies have shown that Latinos are among the least likely to vote of 
any minority group. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, we thought the main problem was lack of voter registration. But 
after doing some research, we realized the main problem was not registration 
but lack of citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 1990 U.S. Census, half of the adult Latinos in this country 
cannot vote because they are not citizens. In the state of California, if you 
take 100 Latinos, 33 cannot vote because they are under age 18 and another 33 
cannot vote because they are not citizens. Automatically, 66% of the Latinos in 
California are barred from participating in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, immigrants are being blamed for all the problems we are facing in 
California. You will never hear a politician blaming other minority groups 
because other minorities can vote. As long as we are a voiceless community, 
politically, we'll be scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
 It's so easy to throw tomatoes at a mute person. It's like people are just 
throwing tomatoes and booing someone whose mouth is covered up and can't say 
anything. Their hands are tied behind their backs, and that's not really fair. 
</P>
<P>
 At NALEO, we believe the immediate response should be for all eligible Latinos 
to become citizens. That way, we will no longer be easy targets. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Latinos can become a very powerful voting bloc. In 1992, 1.2 million 
Latinos in California voted, up from 800,000 in 1988. Carrying the Latino vote 
can be crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is the potential for this state's 1.6 million amnesty applicants to 
become citizens and be eligible to vote by 1996. Even if half of them become 
citizens, it would be a very strong influence on the total results of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why we wanted to find out why eligible Latinos were not taking 
advantage of the opportunity to become U.S. citizens. So, in 1989, we did a 
national survey of legal, permanent residents eligible to become citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The results showed that the main reasons Latinos do not apply for citizenship 
are that they are unaware of the benefits of citizenship and are unable to get 
information from the immigration bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, surprisingly, in our survey, we found that 53% of the eligible Latinos 
did express an interest in becoming citizens and had taken some kind of step 
toward the process of naturalization -- either they had enrolled in a 
citizenship class or gotten a citizenship application. 
</P>
<P>
 We also found that only 25% of them actually reached their goal and became 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So we did more questioning as to why they fell out of the process and we found 
that it's having to deal with this huge INS bureauracracy, having to fill out 
an application that is four pages long and asks intimidating questions like, 
"Have you ever committed a crime for which you have not been prosecuted?" and 
"Are you a Nazi?" That created a lot of confusion for our community. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also an element of fear -- fear of the INS exam. In reality, to 
become a citizen you simply have to have a basic knowledge of this country's 
history and government and be able to speak simple English and write a simple 
sentence in English. Yet there are a lot of misconceptions in the community -- 
that the English test is very difficult, that applicants have to renounce their 
country of origin and step on the flag of their birth country. 
</P>
<P>
 We have tried to demystify the naturalization process. We use a model we 
developed in late 1986 that we call a citizenship workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 We recruit community volunteers, mostly high school and college students, and 
we train them on how to fill out the citizenship application correctly.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, we find a site in a community that's highly populated by Latinos, like 
South Gate, Bell, Santa Ana or Oxnard and have the volunteers help the people 
at the workshop fill out the application. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We take care of submitting all the completed applications to the INS so the 
people do not have to deal with the INS at all for that first session. In 
California, we hold these workshops twice a month. So far this year, we've 
assisted more than 3,000 people in a dozen workshops, using 80 to 120 
volunteers each time. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a Spanish saying, "Al que no habla, Dios no lo oiga." It translates: 
He who does not speak is not heard by God. 
</P>
<P>
 If we want to continue to just be statistics and not be heard in this country, 
we run a lot of risks. There are services available for citizens and there is a 
willingness on behalf of the INS to naturalize all those who are eligible. If 
we don't do it for ourselves, we should become citizens for our families.

VOICES: FINDING HOPE IN L.A. AFTER TERROR IN HAITI, FEAR ON THE HIGH SEAS; AN 
ARISTIDE SUPPORTER RISKED THE PERILOUS OCEAN VOYAGE AFTER HIS FRIENDS WERE 
BEATEN AND KILLED. 'I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD EVER GO BACK,' HE SAYS, AFRAID TO 
REVEAL HIS IDENTITY.

<P>
By JEAN PAUL, Jean Paul is a pseudonym for a 28-year-old Haitian man who was 
among the boat people who fled their homeland after the November, 1991, 
overthrow of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's first democratically elected 
president. Jean Paul says that using his real name could endanger his family 
still in Haiti. A speaker of Haitian Creole, he was interviewed through an 
interpreter by Mike Wyma. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was in 1992, before Christmas, that I escaped. I had to because I was in 
charge of a youth committee organized under the Aristide government. What we 
did was go out and clean the streets. When Aristide was exiled, the new 
government came looking for anybody or any group that was supporting him. The 
group I was in charge of stayed together even after Aristide left, so they came 
after us. 
</P>
<P>
 I escaped, but a lot of the members of that youth group were arrested. Some 
were killed, some were beaten up. Some of them were 18 or younger. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in hiding for three days in a place called Souspistel. It's like a 
neighborhood or a very small town. In Souspistel I met others who were also in 
hiding. They told me that they were going to take a boat out of the country and 
I should come along with them. 
</P>
<P>
 I was very frightened of the ocean but I decided I would rather die there than 
by staying in my country. We left on a Saturday and by Sunday afternoon we ran 
into the American boats. They took us to Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
 I was at Guantanamo and was transferred to Miami. I have family in Miami but I 
couldn't find them. I was given an offer by the immigration service to come to 
Los Angeles. I have permission from the immigration service to stay as a 
political refugee. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a house painter and a handyman. In Haiti you don't need certification to 
work as a painter. When I came to Los Angeles I found a job as a painter and 
handyman but I didn't have a painting contractor's license. So I could not 
continue working. 
</P>
<P>
 I needed to go to school and get a certification and that was just too 
complicated and would take too long. So now I'm working for a company that 
manufactures syringes. After the syringes are finished, I clean them up for 
shipping. Catholic Charities helped me find the job. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't know anybody when I came here. I didn't have any family. I was 
scared. A man from Catholic Charities was there at the airport to receive the 
refugees. Catholic Charities had rented a hotel where they put all the 
refugees. We stayed there about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 When I started working, I started getting to know people. Now I'm renting an 
apartment with a friend near Adams Boulevard and Vermont. I've made some good 
friends in the refugee community, but no one really outside of that community.  
</P>
<P>
 I want to learn English. To live in this country you have to speak English. 
That's the starting point for me. Once I learn English I can learn a trade of 
some sort and really get a better job and improve my life. I really feel the 
language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 I was going to school to learn English before I got the job I have now, but 
the school and the job are very far apart. The job is in the San Fernando 
Valley. I had to stop the school.  
</P>
<P>
 The Jehovah's Witnesses have helped me get through the difficult times. I used 
to be a Protestant back home but I'm with the Jehovah's Witnesses now, 
studying. I like the teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti I have my mother and two brothers. My mother would never leave Haiti. 
One brother loves Haiti very much and would never leave. The other one would 
like to leave.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if I could ever go back. The people who are after me, even if the 
government changed, there are so many of them you can never tell if they have 
all left. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are not exactly like I'd like them to be in Los Angeles. I have a lot 
of difficulties. However, it's a lot better than in Haiti. Not only did I have 
more problems there, my life was in danger. So I'm a lot better off. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to go to school, but because of the jobs I find, that is not a 
possibility right now. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to write to my family back home or to hear from them to see how 
they're doing. But it's just not a safe thing to be doing. That saddens me. 
</P>
<P>
 I never thought I'd come to America, so I didn't have any ideas about it. I 
didn't have expectations. Now that I'm here, I like it. But I still love my 
country too.

MOVIES; NATURAL BORN ACTOR; COMIC TITAN RODNEY DANGERFIELD IS GETTING RESPECT 
FOR HIS PERFORMANCE AS A HATEFUL DAD IN 'NATURAL BORN KILLERS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Hilary de Vries, Hilary de Vries is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His living room is as white and still as an ashram, but he stands there 
looking as exhausted and rheumy-eyed as we remember him. Rodney Dangerfield, 
creator of all those edgy, collar-yanking stand-up routines, the "I can't get 
no respect" Rodney Dangerfield who, at 72, is as much a part of our collective 
cultural consciousness as his fabled white shirt and red tie now lying in state 
at the Smithsonian.  
</P>
<P>
 If he is not the oldest stand-up comedian still working, he is most certainly 
the only comic whose influence spans three generations; his nightclub act 
predates Lenny Bruce and his proteges, fostered at his own club, Dangerfield's 
in New York and on his HBO specials, include the late Sam Kinison, Andrew Dice 
Clay and Jim Carrey. "Rodney Dangerfield," as one critic once put it, "is the 
godfather of the cutting edge of comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 He has not performed live for more than a year, but he has not been idle. 
After launching a modest but successful film career in 1980 with "Caddyshack" 
-- and becoming something of a box-office draw with his 1986 sleeper hit, "Back 
to School" -- Dangerfield has embarked on two new endeavors: his second 
marriage, to Joan Child, a 41-year-old florist, and a first-ever dramatic role, 
as Juliette Lewis' reprehensible father, in Oliver Stone's controversial film 
"Natural Born Killers," which opens Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always on to the next thing," he says, padding around his minimalist 
Wilshire Boulevard apartment in his black velvet slippers as if he were looking 
for something long ago misplaced. Here's the white marble steam room he had 
installed ("it was a closet but I'm not into clothes"), here are photographs of 
himself, with Joan, with his two grown children, with President Clinton -- "To 
Rodney . . . thanks for the respect, Bill Clinton." Here's the impressive view 
off the living room window. "We're waiting for drapes, those are just 
temporary," he says, sinking into the massive leather chair behind an equally 
massive burled wood desk while he continues the tour. "This furniture was 
supposed to be in the other room, but Joan had the brilliant idea of putting it 
in here." 
</P>
<P>
 He sighs and lights a cigarette. After years of playing clubs and Vegas and 
back again, years of an equally turbulent personal life, he now seems a man of 
carefully considered routine whose days are as clean-limbed as his home. He has 
three scripts he's trying to shepherd into production, but mostly that means 
writing and phone calls sandwiched between mornings spent in the pool and 
afternoons at the gym, sweating it all out in the steam room. He explains all 
this puffing serenely on a series of cigarettes. "I'm still very 
self-destructive," he says, slapping the pink sliver of paunch protruding 
between his shirt and trousers. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dangerfield does seem a walking anomaly. Despite the obvious happiness of 
his marriage -- "OK, Joan baby, I'll see you at 6," he sings into the phone -- 
he still nurses a brutally Darwinian approach to life, that nobody, as he puts 
it, "gets a free ride." Even as he insists "that comfort in my life comes first 
now," he evinces a startling insecurity, an emotional nakedness that, at times, 
is colored by the free-floating hostility of his old stand-up routines. "Do I 
scare you, honey?" he says, his bloodshot eyes suddenly as wild as they ever 
were. "Because I could scare you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: So, this past year has been a big one -- your second marriage and 
your first dramatic film role -- all after you turned 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Well, I never thought I'd get married again, but I met Joan 10 years 
ago -- she owns a flower shop and I stopped in to smell the flowers and I guess 
Joan smelled better -- and when you add it all up, I love her, she's a great 
girl. You know, I quit show business to get married the first time, when I was 
28. I used to do a joke about it, that I was the only one who knew I quit. Then 
I came back at age 40 and everybody thought I was crazy. But I've always 
worked. I've been writing jokes since I was 15 and now I guess I'm an actor 
too. Or at least Oliver Stone thought so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's talk about this role. It's quite different than anything you've 
played in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oliver calls me -- I don't know him and I wasn't even that familiar with 
his work because we all have our own bags, do our own thing, you know? But he's 
very complimentary about my work, seen all my movies and thinks I'm an actor. 
He says he's got this part for me. Well, I never saw a script, he just said I 
was supposed to be "the father from hell." And the way I act in the movie is 
horrible. I deserve to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I gather you also wrote, or rewrote, most of your own lines? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I wrote "Easy Money" and some of "Back to School" and, with "Caddyshack," I 
came with 20 new jokes every day. I also write on the spot. So on this movie, 
all the filthy stuff I wrote. Oliver said he loved it and that was it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Beyond the writing, how did you prepare as an actor? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, you know a lot of comedians want to be actors and this was an acting 
piece -- different, but still it was easy. A lot of people when they want to do 
a thing about Puerto Rico, say, they got to move there for a month to prepare. 
Me? You just go into character and you do it. That's it. You put a sneer on 
your face and you do it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It has to be more complex than that. Even your reviews for "Caddyshack" 
praised your performance as "actually playing a character." 
</P>
<P>
 A: I can act easy; stand-up is the hard one -- months to prepare an 
eight-minute act. But when I do a movie they're all me, but a shade off. This 
one ("Natural Born Killers") was a big change, but generally speaking, you just 
adjust it toward you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think when you see yourself on film, particularly as in this, 
in an unsympathetic role? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I hate myself. Are you kidding? Oh, yeah, I'd rather be young and on a 
surfboard. Who wants to be that character? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Well, the whole movie is rather surprising. What do you think of it, all 
the violence, particularly since your character is so venal, and yet the scene 
is played as a comedy with a laugh track? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's funny to have this vicious guy and put him in a sitcom. I don't know 
whether to laugh at me or take me seriously. People are taking me seriously, 
aren't they? The acting we're doing is to try and make it seem believable. But 
the movie brings out a good point how parents can ruin children. Of course, not 
every parent is as bad as me in the movie but in general, parents can hurt 
their kids without even knowing it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What can you possibly follow this role with? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The idea is to keep busy. To do nothing is tough. I love stand-up, but I 
haven't done any in more than a year. It's hard honing an act, to make it look 
off the cuff. I love it, because it's just you by yourself and it certainly 
pays better than doing a movie. You know what I got for "Caddyshack"? $35,000. 
As a matter of fact, it cost me a quarter of a million to do the picture 
because I had to give up Vegas for six weeks. But I haven't played Vegas in a 
year. Now, I'm concentrating on these creative projects instead, these three 
films that I've written, with a friend of mine.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are they comedies like "Caddyshack" or something more serious? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They're all sort of about what a man will do for love. One is called 
"Serenade Cafe," which is sort of a true fairy tale. The other one is wild, 
totally fictional, called "My Love Affair With La Contessa," and the last one 
is called "Ladies' Man," where, according to my religion, I have 12 wives. It 
takes place in this country. See, my wife is Mormon and from Utah. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Wait a minute, your real wife is a Mormon, or this is in the movie? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My real wife. I got the idea from talking to her family. I like the whole 
situation so much next week I'm marrying her sister. (Pause) That's a joke, 
honey.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It sounds like you found some kind of new religion -- a happy personal life 
-- which is a switch for the guy who built his career on chronic unhappiness. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, as much as I love stand-up, you can do a show, feel good, take your 
bow and when you walk into your dressing room, you're alone. The audience 
doesn't love you, they love what you did. Well, that love isn't enough for me 
now. I did it for 20 years, but now, I'd rather have the love of a person you 
can respect and love.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So Rodney Dangerfield has become a Panglossian optimist after all these 
years? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Listen, we could all write a book. I'm one of the masses -- I could never 
be a big shot -- and they (audiences) know it. Thirty years ago, I'm in a 
domestic situation where I suddenly am not living at home but in a cheap hotel 
in New York. I was broke. I owed $20,000 and I decided to go back into show 
business and everybody said I was nuts and was finished. I was 44 and I 
couldn't get booked anywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But that's when you became "Rodney Dangerfield" and became really 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 A: You mature and I also developed an image and they're hard to find. At 44, I 
finally had an image and something to say -- that nothing goes right -- and 
people identified with it. When I did the Sullivan show for the fourth time, 
that's when I came up with "No respect." I told the joke "I played 
hide-and-seek and no one came to look for me" and that was it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why do you think it was the "no respect" image that got you professional 
respect? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know, I guess people think I'm a nice guy. But it's funny having 
that image because people actually believe it and try to take advantage of you. 
You wouldn't believe the things that people say to me. One night, I'm doing a 
show at my club in New York, and right before I go on stage a guy at a table 
stops me and says, "Rodney, do me a favor. Can I have your autograph and some 
more butter?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did you do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Laughing) I told the waiter to get him some more butter. But is that an 
image?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Regardless of whether your "no respect" persona is true to life, it has had 
amazing longevity. Unlike a lot of comedians your age, you appeal to a younger 
generation, as a New York Times review of your 1988 show, "Rodney Dangerfield 
on Broadway" pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't like to brag about it, but Jack Benny came to my club once before 
he died and he said, "I've got the cheap image, but you appeal to everybody." 
And not to talk or anything, but kids are very into me. My audiences are like 
18-, 19-, 20-year-olds and I get mail from kids like 3 and 4 years old -- like 
I'm some weird uncle of theirs or something. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But beyond your own image, you have been very influential in bringing along 
new comics. You've found a lot of people, most notably Sam Kinison, and given 
them exposure at your club and on your HBO specials. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I get a kick out of seeing a guy make it. Sam Kinison was a genius. 
Mad, but a genius. I put him on twice and boom. I gave Roseanne some of her 
first exposure. Dice. No one would put Dice on, so even though I thought he was 
doing a dirty version of what I did a little bit, I put him on and he busted 
right out. One special I had on Sam Kinison, Roseanne, Jerry Seinfeld, Robert 
Townsend.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Jim Carrey gives you a lot of credit for helping launch his career. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Jim I found in Canada about 10 years ago when he opened for me there and I 
thought he was great, very talented, very unusual. So I brought him to Vegas to 
open for me at Caesars and then out here when I played the (Universal) 
Amphitheatre. I'm very happy for his success. It couldn't happen to a nicer 
guy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the future of the comedy-club scene, with so many comics having big 
TV and movie careers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Today the director is the star or the editor or the producer, but for me, 
stand-up, where they show they love you right away, will always be the one. 
Because I'll tell you, with TV you lose the chance to perfect something. My 
father used to go on the road for 10 months to break in an eight-minute act. 
When I did "The Tonight Show," it took me three months to prepare for it, three 
months of writing and breaking in something like 32 new jokes, getting the 
rhythms right so when I was talking to Carson, it looked all off-the-cuff. You 
don't get that with movies or television. . . . I could tell you stories, but 
what the heck.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Oh, tell the stories. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Listen, I worked so many joints and clubs, but nothing is ever easy. 
Whatever business you get into has problems. Mine was coming from the bottom. 
What could I do? Anything. I used to drive a laundry truck on Mondays and 
Saturdays and a fish truck on Thursdays and Fridays and Wednesdays I'd go into 
the city to look for a job in show business. 
</P>
<P>
 I got a job as a singing waiter at the old Polish Falcon club in Brooklyn 
because I sweetened their Christmas fund. Lenny Bruce's mother, Sally Marr, was 
the emcee and she introduced me and I'd go on and sing (he breaks into song) 
"There will be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover, tomorrow you just wait 
and see. . . ." I was 18 and I wanted to get involved with show business where 
I could get some of the love I never got at home. You know, "Tell me I'm OK, 
people," because I had many ill experiences as a youth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The proverbial difficult childhood . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A: Hey, we all get wounded and if you think you have it bad, thousands have it 
worse. I started writing my autobiography but it was too painful. I had a 
difficult mother and a father who saw me twice a year. But every childhood is 
worse than another. Are you happy? I say you got to be born dumb, lucky or 
religious to make it in life. And, in most cases, kids never live up to their 
baby pictures. Show me a kid when he's 4. Have I got a winner! Show me a 
picture of Al Capone at 4. Have I got a winner. Picture of Hitler. Cute kid. A 
winner. But I will say that people who are outside show business tell me they 
don't have the same need for love that people in show business have.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But there must have been a time when you put that behind you and realized 
you made it on your own. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Mine was a very slow procedure, not like Elvis, who did one song and the 
country went crazy. I can't say one thing did it for me because I did 16 Ed 
Sullivan shows, 45 Merv Griffin shows, 70 "Tonight Shows" with Carson. Listen, 
I did 20 Lite beer commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't ever think in terms of making it. It's a job. If a guy, a bellman, 
picks up my suitcase, I still feel awkward. I've been broke most of my life, on 
the other end of the stick. So I got lucky now. I'm still one of the masses, 
and I can never change.

FILM CLIPS: PARALLEL LIVES; CAN YOU SAY 'COINCIDENCE' IN SPANISH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Levine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many have long debated whether art imitates life or life imitates art, but in 
the case of Whit Stillman's current "Barcelona," they took turns imitating each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, which follows the romantic affairs of two American male cousins in 
Spain, is loosely based on some of Stillman's experiences, but actor Taylor 
Nichols really made those experiences come alive. 
</P>
<P>
 While playing a character who falls in love with a Spanish woman in Barcelona, 
Nichols actually fell in love with a Spanish woman in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 And does he find that a bit ironic? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny, because (the movie) is sort of about Whit's life," Nichols, 33, 
says. "My character in the movie parallels what Whit did: He fell in love with 
this Spanish woman and had to deal with the differences between American 
culture and Spanish culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure enough, then the actor that Whit casts . . . falls in love with a 
Spanish woman and has to deal with American culture and Spanish culture." 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, debates about the merits of hamburgers and American consumer 
culture play out against a background of anti-NATO and anti-American feelings 
in early-'80s Barcelona and are further complicated by the rivalry between 
sales-obsessed businessman Ted Boynton, played by Nichols, and his uninhibited 
Navy cousin Fred, played by Chris Eigeman. 
</P>
<P>
 The real-life story was considerably more pleasant. Nichols, who spoke no 
Spanish before he got to Spain and still speaks very little, met his 
girlfriend, Marga de Eguilior, through some Spanish friends of hers who worked 
on the movie in Barcelona, and Nichols says the two hit it off immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 And the irony of the situation was not lost on those who worked on the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "The editor said: 'How funny is it to be shooting these same exact scenes in 
almost the same exact bar talking about almost the exact same thing,' " Nichols 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 When filming was completed in July of last year, Nichols left Spain, but he 
and De Eguilior have visited since then, and she moved into his Fairfax 
district apartment a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That happy ending follows the film's script, but that's where the similarities 
end. Unlike his character, the neurotic Boynton, Nichols is relaxed and 
affable, and the closest he ever came to a career in sales was a major in 
economics at the University of Michigan, where he was involved in theater. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating, Nichols says he "just sort of got more and more into acting. 
I was doing summer stock and I just kept working." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually Nichols' career took him to New York City, where he acted in 
musical theater and Off Off Broadway productions. Almost on a whim, he went to 
an open call for "Metropolitan," Stillman's acclaimed 1989 film about Manhattan 
preppy life. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the part of Charlie, and eventually the friendship of Stillman, who 
decided to cast him and "Metropolitan" co-star Eigeman in "Barcelona" when they 
finished shooting "Metropolitan." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same characters, pushed up a notch," Nichols says. "I'm Whit, Chris 
is Whit's alter ego." 
</P>
<P>
 After "Metropolitan," a role on the short-lived NBC television show "Man of 
the People" brought Nichols out to Los Angeles, where he won guest roles on 
such television shows as "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" and "Murder, She Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
 Since finishing "Barcelona," Nichols has started to work behind the camera 
too, producing and acting in "Closing Notice," an independent film about "a 
dancer who's too old hitting bottom" and writing a script about silent film 
star Harold Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 De Eguilior, who was studying law in Spain, is now adjusting to life in Los 
Angeles and still finds the "Barcelona" coincidence amusing. "When we started 
going out, I read the script and I thought it was very funny," she said in a 
separate interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols, who says De Eguilior "completely changed" his life, half-jokingly 
sums up the situation best. "When you're working on a movie for so long, you 
can't help but become immersed in the character."

FILM CLIPS: PAUL & AMY & DAVID & HELEN; A STARRY SWAP MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I t was a cozy coincidence, even by Hollywood standards, a tantalizing 
partner-swapping involving four of TV's hottest stars taking a vacation hiatus 
to the big screen. "Mad About You" stars Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt, Emmy 
nominees for best actor and actress in a comedy series, were busy filming 
feature projects in Los Angeles and New York respectively, opposite fellow 
nominees Amy Brenneman and David Caruso from "NYPD Blue."Reiser stars in "Bye 
Bye, Love," above , a 20th Century Fox comedy due next year about divorced 
fathers; he plays opposite Brenneman, nominated for best supporting actress in 
a drama for her work in "NYPD Blue," on which she played David Caruso's 
ex-lover. Meanwhile Hunt plays Caruso's wife in Barbet Schroeder's "Kiss of 
Death," right , a crime thriller also for Fox. Caruso, nominated for best actor 
in a drama for "NYPD Blue," plays a man forced to infiltrate the New York 
criminal world. Of the apparent mate-swapping, Reiser says, "Actually, it 
wasn't so much of a coincidence -- first they offered me a nomination (and) I 
said 'No thanks.' Then they told me Helen Hunt, David Caruso and Amy Brenneman 
would get one. . . ." Robert Levine

FILM CLIPS: PEEWEES' PLAYHOUSE; NEW QUARTERBACK TAKES 'LITTLE GIANTS' TOWARD 
GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How's this for a game plan? Let director Duwayne Dunham coach Warner Bros.' 
peewee football movie, "Little Giants," until the last 3 1/2 weeks of shooting 
and then bring aboard another director to drive the movie home. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very rare that a director is ever pulled off a picture this late in the 
game. But for the movie, which was behind schedule, to be finished for its Oct. 
14 release, the move was a necessary one, say sources involved with the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and sources close to 
Dunham and director Brian Levant, brought in from his vacation as the relief 
director, confirm the scenario. Levant directed the $100-million-plus summer 
blockbuster "The Flintstones." 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Giants," which stars Rick Moranis and Ed O'Neill, is about two 
competing football teams and the brothers -- one's a sports buff and the other 
is far from being a winner -- who end up coaching them. Moranis' character 
pulls the short straw, and -- big surprise -- gets stuck with the loser team. 
</P>
<P>
 Amblin spokesman Marvin Levy said the company felt Levant, an avowed football 
buff, was just the guy to direct the remaining big-game sequences of the movie. 
Not only did he direct Universal's 1992 family movie "Beethoven," but he's 
"done a lot of TV and worked with a lot of kids," Levy says. 
</P>
<P>
 So Dunham, an editing pro who had worked for director David Lynch and George 
Lucas for 10 years and who also had directed "Homeward Bound: The Incredible 
Journey," was thrown into the editing room to rush the movie through 
post-production while Levant finished the shooting. Sources say that Dunham was 
bumped because the $25-million movie was 10 days over its budgeted shooting 
time and Warner Bros. was committed to releasing the picture at the height of 
football season. Even more critical, sources say, the comedy wasn't funny 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 But Amblin's Levy, Dunham's agent (John Burnham of William Morris) and 
Levant's agent (Peter Benedek of United Talent Agency) insist that the film is 
funny and that Levant's presence has nothing to do with Dunham's departure. In 
fact, they say, Dunham is expected to get sole director credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Duwayne is not an action director and it was his choice to move into 
post-production on this film so it could be released in time," says Burnham. 
"It was with his consent that Brian was brought aboard to handle (back-up 
directing)." 
</P>
<P>
 Levy chimes in, "Besides, if the film wasn't funny it would take a lot more 
than three weeks to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 Benedict declined to comment further; the two directors could not be reached.

STROKES OF GENIUS -- ON ANY BUDGET; 'SECRET HONOR' IS SET DESIGNER ROBERT W. 
ZENTIS' 15TH SHOW THIS YEAR. AT THIS RATE, HE COULD BREAK HIS RECORD OF 25 
SHOWS IN A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Isenberg, Barbara Isenberg is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Set designer Robert W. Zentis likes the idea of nearing 60. "It is 
exhilarating," he says, "to feel myself thinking like a young man with an old 
and oiled mind." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't hurt that Zentis apparently also has the energy of a young man. 
"Secret Honor: The Last Testament of Richard M. Nixon," a revival of the 
award-winning play by Donald Freed and Arnold M. Stone, is Zentis' 15th show 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secret Honor" is at Hollywood's Fountain Theatre, where Zentis works as 
resident designer. It opened Aug. 5, just a few weeks after "Brush Strokes" at 
the Met, on which he designed lights, and the Celebration Theatre's "Lesbian 
Seagulls," on which he did sets and lights.  
</P>
<P>
 At this pace, the 59-year-old designer could top his own record, set two years 
ago, of 25 shows in one year. Zentis has received so many awards from 
Drama-Logue alone that he finally ran out of wall space and stopped framing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has tireless energy," comments Fountain producer Jay Alan Quantrill. "He 
has so many ideas, and he can always make something out of almost nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 This is particularly challenging at the 78-seat Fountain Theatre, a place with 
flexible seating arrangements, a low ceiling and a low, relatively small stage. 
The front row of seats is maybe three feet from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more that I design, the more I think it true that set design is a little 
like poetry," says Zentis, a friendly man with flyaway gray hair. "When you 
write a novel, impressions are made with a lot of words. But, when you're 
trying to do haiku, every syllable and word conveys a lot more than it might in 
another context." 
</P>
<P>
 For "Ars Erotica," a play Quantrill wrote about German painter Egon Schiele, 
Zentis painted the theater's back wall in a painterly style emulating Schiele. 
He used real birch trees last fall to turn the whole theater into a forest 
setting for Chekhov's "The Sea Gull." 
</P>
<P>
 Zentis designs both set and lights on "Secret Honor." Fees are small in small 
theaters, and Zentis says he generally receives $500 to $2,000 a show, 
depending on the play, its complexity, its budget and where it is playing. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives relatively simply. His weathered 1986 truck has almost 200,000 miles 
on it, and he's lived in the same Hollywood apartment house for 19 years. Asked 
if he can make a living designing sets here, Zentis replies, "Yes, barely. 
Every now and then, industrial shows (which can pay $20,000 to $30,000 each) 
save me." 
</P>
<P>
 Zentis has been a designer -- of plays, operas, industrial shows, even 
theaters and residences -- nearly all his adult life. Raised in the tiny 
farming village of McKean, Penn., he first studied playwriting at Yale Drama 
School, then later switched to theater design at Northwestern.  
</P>
<P>
 He first came here in the late '60s -- to design sets for the Pasadena 
Playhouse -- and he has taught stage design everywhere from Occidental College 
to UCLA and USC. Over the years, he's also worked at the Mark Taper Forum, but 
most of his nearly 300 credits have been in such small houses as the Fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't that I eliminate large shows, which do come along every now and 
then," says Zentis, "but I like to keep very busy. I don't want to not work. 
And the creative process is the same no matter where you're working. I'm 
solving the same kinds of problems in the same kinds of ways whether the show 
has a stage budget of $3,000 or millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 "Secret Honor," for instance, came in on the low end. Scheduled for only three 
weeks rather than the Fountain's usual six-week run, it had to have a very 
economical set. Upscale furniture was both rented and donated, with discards 
from TV's "L.A. Law" helping to keep the cost of its set at only about $3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Zentis, as most designers, also takes staging cues from the script, director, 
producer and actors. On "Secret Honor," a provocative one-man show starring 
Philip Baker Hall as the 37th President, Zentis read the script, talked with 
actor Hall and director Mitchell Ryan, then consulted such reference books as 
Nixon's memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, which was produced at Los Angeles Actors' Theatre in 1983 and later 
made into a Robert Altman film, is set in the study of Nixon's New Jersey 
apartment shortly after his resignation. Walls are lined with historic 
portraits of Nixon alone and with his wife, Pat, or such people as Eisenhower, 
Mao and Kissinger.  
</P>
<P>
 Sitting out in the audience seats a few hours before "Secret Honor's" first 
preview, Zentis took a break as assistants finished putting out books, dusting 
piano keys and vacuuming the carpet.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has any idea of all the stuff that goes into making this happen," he 
said. "Which is the point. They shouldn't have any idea." 
</P>
<P>
 * " Secret Honor: The Last Testament of Richard M. Nixon" plays 
Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. at the Fountain Theatre, 5060 Fountain Ave., 
Hollywood, (213) 663-1525. Ends Aug. 28. Tickets $15-$17.50.

PERFORMING ARTS; COMMENTARY; LENNY THE RED MENACE; LEONARD BERNSTEIN'S LIBERAL 
LEANINGS KEPT THE FBI BUSY FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS. WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE THE 
GOVERNMENT SO NERVOUS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Leonard Bernstein, who died at the age of 72 in October, 1990, was many things 
to many people. 
</P>
<P>
 To almost everyone, he was a brilliant, incorrigibly flamboyant, essentially 
romantic conductor and a facile, conservative, sentimental composer who never 
seemed to have quite enough time to fulfill his own extraordinary promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein -- Lenny even to strangers -- also was a piano virtuoso manque , a 
knowing lecturer understandably in love with the sound of his own voice, a 
handsome, all-American arts salesman par excellence , a self-made cultural 
icon, a committed if not invariably discerning sociopolitical liberal, an 
unapologetic egomaniac, a playful wit, a chronic over-achiever and, according 
to two recent biographies, a man of flamboyant ambisexual affinities. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind all that. To J. Edgar Hoover and his intrepid FBI, Bernstein was 
something else and something worse: a possible Commie. 
</P>
<P>
 Yikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein, we are told, posed a potential threat to all things nationally 
sacred and serene. Call him Lenny the Red Menace. 
</P>
<P>
 In the relatively cool light of 1994, it seems like a joke. A silly joke. A 
bad joke. An expensive joke. A painful joke. But, thanks to four years of 
perseverance on the part of Allan Parachini, a former Times reporter now with 
the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, no one is laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI files, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act after much blood, 
sweat, tears and delay, reveal that our governmental guardians of virtue spent 
nearly 30 years spying on Bernstein. The spying, not incidentally, turned out 
to be incredibly inept and totally unproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 It began in 1943. It involved cloak-and-dagger informants, electronic 
monitoring, surveillance by special agents and a lot of raw-rumor mongering. It 
took place in New York, Boston, St. Louis and even Los Angeles. The files 
consist of nearly 700 quasi-literate pages, many of them still partially 
censored -- for reasons uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 All the documents were officially "classified." Some bore the ominous stamp 
"secret." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein occasionally embraced extra-musical causes that drew him away from 
the righteous right. He did not invariably check out the lineage of every 
organization that used his name or accepted his donations. But he swore that he 
was not a Communist Party member. His lengthy, impassioned disclaimer can be 
found in the FBI files. 
</P>
<P>
 If -- horror of horrors -- he was a communist sympathizer 50 years ago, the 
nature of that sympathy was never clearly defined. Nor was the nature of its 
threat to the survival of our loftiest values. 
</P>
<P>
 His opposition to the Vietnam War was never in doubt. That didn't exactly put 
him in lonely company. 
</P>
<P>
 His fleeting, probably naive association with the Black Panthers at a party in 
his Park Avenue apartment did little beyond enriching our language with the 
term "radical chic." Habitually with-it , Bernstein reportedly said he dug some 
aspect of the minority cause. 
</P>
<P>
 That must have made Hoover and his boys in Washington particularly nervous. Or 
gleeful. Still, in the end, it didn't mean much. The ship of state did not 
sink. Life went on. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Bernstein functioned for most of his career as the epitome of that 
tired cliche, the cultural ambassador. He made friends for himself, for music 
and, not least, for America, wherever he traveled. The fellow traveled a lot, 
even in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Music may indeed have charms to soothe a savage breast, to soften rocks or 
bend a knotted oak. Congreve was no fool. Nevertheless, music doesn't seem able 
to do much in the long run to corrupt decency or lower morality. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein's primary language certainly was music. According to the FBI files, 
it was Bernstein the man, not his output, that threatened to get him into 
trouble. At worst, there was some ominous speculation that the pacifist 
sentiments of his "Mass" might embarrass President Nixon at the opening of the 
Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of governmental interference is easiest to define when the subject 
matter overtly offends political zealots who want to be offended. We were 
reminded of that danger only this month when the National Council on the Arts 
overturned photography grants recommended by panels of the beleaguered National 
Endowment for the Arts. The individuals scorned in this case -- Andres Serrano, 
Merry Alpern and Barbara DeGenevieve -- dared to focus their cameras on 
subjects apparently too indelicate for official sanction: sex and religion. 
</P>
<P>
 What is it, one wonders, that makes statesmen, or unreasonable facsimiles 
thereof, so uneasy about the potentially lofty muses? 
</P>
<P>
 When one of Hitler's cohorts heard the word Kultur , he said he automatically 
reached for his revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 The notorious White House tapes documented Nixon's particular paranoia about 
the cultural community. "The arts, you know -- they're Jews," he declared. 
"They're left-wing. In other words, stay away." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein was both a Jew and, after his fashion, left-wing. Nixon stayed away 
from the premiere of "Mass." 
</P>
<P>
 "The FBI owes it to all Amer icans to provide irrefutable, convincing proof 
that the bureau is no longer doing what it did to Leonard Bernstein," says Mark 
Rosenbaum, legal director of the ACLU, "and is no longer trying to cover up 
such activities." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI might take a reassuring step in the right direction with the immediate 
release of the unexpurgated Bernstein files. One wants to know what lies 
beneath those nasty black blocks that besmirch page after page. Even more, one 
wants to know what is contained in the 81 pages still missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the FBI thinks it is practicing damage control, or belatedly 
protecting decorum, by deleting references to Bernstein's sexual proclivities. 
If that is so, the exhaustive books by Joan Peyser and Humphrey Burton make any 
such effort obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the FBI feels an aura of noble secrecy must be maintained to justify 
its snooping. If that is so, the ancient excuse invoked -- "national security" 
-- has been stretched beyond credibility, and beyond moral conviction.

ART; COMMENTARY; TWO ARTISTS AND THE MEANING OF IDENTITY; BRUCE NAUMAN AND MIKE 
KELLEY MIX THEIR MEDIA, NEITHER RELYING ON TRADITIONAL PAINTING OR SCULPTURE IN 
THEIR PURSUIT OF ARTISTIC IDENTITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A principal convention of mod ern culture says that true art asserts 
individual identity, which is hidden behind a surface facade that is, in fact, 
a mere illusion. So, the artist's job is to go beyond outward appearance to 
reveal that hidden self. 
</P>
<P>
 Two concurrent museum exhibitions not only make for an extraordinarily strong 
summer season in Los Angeles, they also demonstrate how this established 
convention has been broadly rejected in the work of two of the most highly 
regarded artists working today. For them, the idea of artistic identity isn't 
what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Museum of Contemporary Art, the retrospective exhibition "Bruce Nauman" 
rousingly confirms the widely held belief in the preeminent stature of the 
52-year-old artist. Meanwhile, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, much 
the same response greets "Mike Kelley," a witty and compelling survey 
exhibition of an artist 13 years Nauman's junior. A sustained level of 
excitement and excellence marks the careers of both. 
</P>
<P>
 While differences between their specific artistic interests are considerable, 
important points of convergence between them can be identified. Nauman and 
Kelley both evince a strong interest in language and humor as engines for 
driving visual art, while neither relies on traditional painting and sculpture 
to do the job. Instead they mix their media, using whatever materials are 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most noteworthy is the relationship of their work to the modern 
convention concerning individual identity. A pronounced feeling of 
free-floating emptiness lurks in both exhibitions -- not an emptiness in the 
negative sense of an art without substance or weight, but one that denies the 
traditional distinction between a deceptive and shallow "outside" that's been 
torn open to reveal a profound "inside" secreted deep within. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to think of the traditional distinction is to cite another 
specifically modern and related invention. Freud asserted that although an 
individual's identity is socially constructed, not just naturally produced, the 
form it takes is conditioned by the inner psychological self. Peeling back 
encrusted outer layers will uncover true identity, rather the way the spiky 
leaves of an artichoke protect its tender innards. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of Surrealism. The idea that rational thought keeps us separate from 
productive sources deep within the subconscious mind led to a high regard for 
the creativity of children, primitive people and the insane, who supposedly 
aren't disconnected from the deep well of spontaneity within. 
</P>
<P>
 This conception of identity -- whether in Freudian psy chology or abstract art 
-- is based on a belief that a powerful center guides and gives meaning to 
experience, which is more commonly known by its vague and amorphous periphery. 
By contrast, Nauman and Kelley make art that dismisses this entrenched Modern 
idea as false. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than revere childhood, Kelley elevates to prominence the conflicted 
years of pimply adolescence, extolling the period when the supposed 
disconnections from inner harmony run amok. His celebrated sculptures made with 
soiled, tattered stuffed animals and plush toys refuse to idealize visions of 
childish purity. And a pair of comic drawings of a two-story outhouse makes 
wicked fun of Freud's explanation for the youthful origins of creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Nauman's repeated use of fragmentary body parts, both human and animal, 
attacks holistic integration. Other sculptures, such as the funny concrete lump 
of "A Cast of the Space Under My Chair" and the sickly, glowing green "Neon 
Template of the Left Half of My Body Taken at Ten-Inch Intervals," are designed 
to give form to emptiness or bodily absence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four-part film, "Art Make-Up," white, pink, green and black body 
make-up is applied sequentially to Nauman's face and naked torso. His outward 
appearance is impassively altered, while the exposed artist's anonymity is 
colorfully secured. 
</P>
<P>
 Nauman's and Kelley's work, like that of several other artists, plays against 
the idea that a substantive center shapes the illusive periphery. For them, the 
periphery is quite as deep and complex, and just as meaningful and real. 
</P>
<P>
 Nauman and Kelley are both Midwesterners. (Nauman was born in Ft. Wayne, Ind.; 
Kelley grew up in a suburb of Detroit). After college both came to the West 
Coast for graduate school and, when they finished, both made the fateful 
decision to stay in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Nauman worked in Los Angeles during the decade in which his precocious 
artistic voice matured into full resonance (1969 to 1979), before moving to 
rural New Mexico, where he lives today. Kelley has lived in Hollywood and Eagle 
Rock, ever since his 1979 graduation from CalArts. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the 20th Century, and especially after World War II, the lure of 
New York has been strong for young artists. By the time Nauman and, a decade 
later, Kelley came along, it still was. 
</P>
<P>
 But their relationship to the center of the art world is revealing. Both 
recognized the significance of Manhattan as a powerful artistic milieu and as a 
major marketplace for contemporary art, and both began to show in commercial 
galleries there early in their respective careers. (Coincidentally, each was a 
youthful 26 when he had his first New York solo show.) However, neither artist 
saw any compelling reason to establish a studio there, as a base from which to 
live and make art. 
</P>
<P>
 The art of Nauman and Kelley has ended up a touchstone for their respective 
generations, both in the United States and Europe, because something about the 
decision to work in L.A. rather than New York fit seamlessly with the 
developing aesthetic position of their art. In renouncing the old idea of a 
split between a deep and meaningful center and a shallow and deceptive 
periphery -- a split that has been undone by mass culture -- they began to 
chart a slippery new terrain in which everyone, everywhere, resides.

GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUNK; LUSCIOUS JACKSON'S FOUR FEMALES PLAY THE GAME 
THEIR WAY, INCORPORATING NEW YORK'S VIBRANT SOUNDTRACK OF PUNK AND HIP-HOP, 
JAZZ AND SOUL.

 'There sure are a lot of girl bands, women bands out now." 
</P>
<P>
 This looks like progress to Jill Cuniff, the co-founder of one of those 
groups, Luscious Jackson. When Cuniff, 28, and her partner, Gabby Glaser, 27, 
were budding teen-age musicians, role models were scarce. There was the 
punk-era English band the Slits, whom they idolized, pursued and interviewed, 
and that was about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so hard to feel confident," says Cuniff. "Not every woman is like this, 
but one thing I've noticed among girls is that they're so shy about showing 
their artwork. You need a lot of encouragement to do it. I've known a lot of 
women musicians who once they're in their 20s have been able to overcome these 
things, but you have to go into a lot of work on yourself to get over that 
(expletive). 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet it's still really hard for girls, if they're surrounded by a bunch of 
guys who are like, 'Girls can't play guitar, they look stupid with guitars,' or 
whatever crap they're being told. . . . They say it doesn't look right, and 
I've known girls who have just believed that to such detrimental effect on 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Luscious Jackson finds itself in a crowded field of role models for 
today's female aspirants. The New York quartet has been considered a potential 
key player ever since the EP "In Search of Manny" introduced its eclectic, 
patchwork sound in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The record was named the top EP of that year in the Village Voice's annual 
poll of the nation's rock critics, and the buzz has built steadily toward the 
release on Tuesday of the group's first full album, "Natural Ingredients" (see 
review, Page 64) . The band will open its tour with shows at LunaPark on 
Thursday and Fuzzyland on Saturday, following a swing through the Midwest on 
Lollapalooza's second stage. 
</P>
<P>
 But is Luscious Jackson the role model today's would-be girl-rockers will look 
to, when the stance of choice for bands seems to be that of strident avengers, 
arming their power-chords with rage and spraying their resentment at punk-rock 
tempos? 
</P>
<P>
 Luscious Jackson (a play on the name of former pro basketball star Lucius 
Jackson) stands apart in sound and temperament, blending sample-rich hip-hop, 
with its jazzy effervescence, and hard-edged R&B grooves into something urgent 
and yearning, like War backing the B-52's. 
</P>
<P>
 And while they're certainly no strangers to the battle of the sexes, Luscious 
Jackson's specialty is complex diplomatic issues rather than blood-and-guts 
trench warfare.  
</P>
<P>
 In the new album's "Deep Shag," a man's presence reduces the woman to 
something so small and infantile that she gets lost in the carpeting of the 
song's title. "Strongman" celebrates a more balanced union, with the 
support-encouraging chorus, "It takes a strong man to stand by a strong woman." 
"Find Your Mind" is a vivid depiction of women lost in a sea of one-night 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a really important song to me, because it's about women who use their 
sexuality in a really negative and self-destructive way," says Cuniff, who 
wrote all the album's songs except Glaser's opening "Citysong." 
</P>
<P>
 "Women still are selling themselves really short and trying to get 
acknowledgment through their bodies and their looks and their sexuality," she 
continues, "and if they're doing it with the wrong people who don't respect 
them, it's just another vacuum like drugs. It's a way to avoid dealing with 
your own self. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real cultural thing. Young girls go out to bars and they basically get 
totally drunk and pick up men. It's sad, because it's really empty. It doesn't 
answer any questions. All it does is make you dislike yourself. . . . The whole 
chorus of 'Find Your Mind' is about dealing with yourself instead of running 
from yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If this all sounds fairly sober and disciplined, well, that's Cuniff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to take my life really seriously, and lead a good life," says the 
singer, who uses meditation to cope with the pressure that comes with being a 
highly watched newcomer in the pop arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't get involved in that. Just can't." She sounds as if she's drilling 
herself with a mantra. "It will kill you. That's like people who have drug 
habits. They get all involved in that (expletive), what other people think of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Cuniff and guitarist Glaser form an ultra-compatible team whose 
friendship dates back to their early teens. Children of the Village, they grew 
up in families where moms had careers and dads helped with the child-rearing, 
and "Our Bodies, Our Selves" and other feminist literature was scattered 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 When they started going to hear music together in the early '80s, they 
blossomed into groove-conscious daughters of New York's polyglot music and art 
scene, coming of age to a vibrant soundtrack of punk and hip-hop, jazz and 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a spirit of that that I think we still feed off of," says Cuniff. 
"Making something that you really love and that's really interesting. Being 
excited."  
</P>
<P>
 Cuniff and Glaser found bliss when they teamed up to record some demos, which 
evolved into the engaging but fragmented "Manny" EP after they sent their work 
to one of their old club-scene pals -- Beastie Boy Mike Diamond. After the 
group supplemented the three original demos with some added cuts, "In Search of 
Manny" became the first release on the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal label. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think its totally forward-looking," says Diamond. "It's not just 
guitar-bass-drums, it's not just a rock band. It's something that's not really 
categorizable. It's creating a new language that is drawing on many things that 
people share, definitely taking it to a new place." 
</P>
<P>
 It was during some of the additional recording that the current four-piece 
lineup -- rounded out by keyboardist Vivian Trimble and original Beastie Boys 
drummer Kate Schellenbach -- came together. 
</P>
<P>
 Things went just as smoothly when Luscious Jackson made the new "Natural 
Ingredients." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Cuniff, "Nothing's really hard. It's just natural. It's very fun. You 
pick your samples, you put 'em together and it's magic." 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is whether Luscious Jackson's message can find a real 
audience out there. Can this positive vibration resonate at a time when punk's 
angry, rapid pounding still rings loud and true, and Angst and dread rain down 
from the new gods on rock's Olympus? 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like there are a lot of kids out there who are excited about life," 
says Cuniff. "The media tries to portray twentysomethings as like numb and 
loser-ish, but when we play our shows, a lot of those kids are really positive. 
Sure, you got your down-and-outers, but I think we're offering something that's 
really positive and fun. We're pretty happy about life." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Glaser, "There are bands out there and their thing is to speak of how 
(expletive)-up everything is -- 'Don't listen to your parents, don't listen to 
your boss, everyone's (expletive) up,' this that and the other -- and a lot of 
kids do really like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think for us, we just want to make music that we love. There have been 
bands in my life that make me really happy and inspired and spirited, and I put 
that record on and I just sing along and I just go crazy. As far as doing your 
part, that's something."

NEVER HEARD OF SELENA? YOU WILL; SHE'S ON THE TOP OF THE BURGEONING FIELD OF 
TEJANO. NOW HOLLYWOOD BECKONS.

<P>
 'Some people must think I prearranged all of this, that I set goals," says 
Selena, 23, the most successful act in the burgeoning Tejano field and one of 
Latin pop's biggest stars. "Actually, I've been fortunate. Things have just 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not really. It's taken 13 years of hard work and whistle-stop touring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then, many male promoters thought a woman couldn't pull in a crowd," 
recalls the singer, who plays the Universal Amphitheatre on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6, she started singing to get attention from her musician father, Abraham 
Quintanilla, while he taught a son to play bass. Her popularity at family 
gatherings prompted Quintanilla to revive his old band, Los Dinos, as Selena y 
Los Dinos. Despite regional hits and Tejano Music Awards, the group didn't 
realize its potential until the then-fledgling EMI Latin label signed it in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Selena's father is still her manager, Los Dinos still includes her 
sister Suzette on drums and songwriting brother Abe III on bass. In addition, 
her husband, Chris Perez, is the group's guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
 Her album "Amor Prohibido," released in April, topped Billboard magazine's 
Latin album chart for four weeks, and even briefly entered Billboard's Top 200 
pop album chart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the younger generation," the Corpus Christi-based singer said of Tejano 
music's popularity. "They're proud of their roots. Latinos are more visible. 
It's cool to speak Spanish. In Mexico, they love the Tejano sound. Fans even 
welcome you at the airport."  
</P>
<P>
 When she isn't recording or touring, she oversees her Selena Etcetera 
boutiques in Texas that sell women's accessories, including dress bras ( 
bustierres ) that she designs and often wears on stage.  
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood has also beckoned. She has a featured role in the forthcoming Marlon 
Brando-Johnny Depp-Faye Dunaway film "Don Carlo and the Centerfold." Asked if 
she plays the centerfold, she laughs. "Not this time. I play a mariachi 
singer." 
</P>
<P>
 * Selena plays Thursday at the Universal Amphitheatre, 100 Universal City 
Plaza, Universal City, 8:15 p.m. $17.50-$25 . (818) 980-9421.

 A colleague seemed surprised and puzzled over my recent choice to buy a CD-ROM 
player, yet curious -- or materialistic -- enough to keep pressing me for 
pertinent details about just what the damn things do and how much they cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom-line question was inevitable: Were I sucker enough to shell for one 
of these , wouldn't it go the way of all flesh and all hardware formats right 
about the time I figured out which side of the disc goes up? hypothesized my 
interrogator, the hollow look of a former Beta man in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed for a defense, I spewed forth some of the usual hopeful, high-sell 
applications of CD-ROM as entertainment and/or information for the home, 
business, university and playroom. But then I decided upon just one word (much 
like the gent who advises Dustin Hoffman about plastics in "The Graduate") to 
assure him that there is a future for the format: 
</P>
<P>
 Pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that I mistook my colleague for Uncle Ernie. It's just that, if some 
of the more pragmatic computer magazines are to be believed, CD-ROM is in much 
the same place now as the VCR was just as that American staple started to boom 
in the early 1980s: an invention touted as fun for the whole family that 
ironically is being fueled largely by the sudden, easy availability of 
soft-core smut. And with this upstart hardware, high-tech dirty pictures become 
a staple of the home and office: While his co-workers go out for lunch, Dad can 
use the same PC that gets steamed up rolling over stocks during business hours 
to interactively order the Pet of the Month to roll over. 
</P>
<P>
 While other new formats may have the support of Sega, you see, CD-ROM has the 
support of Seka. 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously (and no one should doubt that the economic viability afforded a 
porn-friendly format is serious business), CD-ROM will probably succeed most of 
all because it works in conjunction with personal computers, thus further 
diluting the diminishing line between business and pleasure. There's guilt 
involved in getting a Gameboy, or probably should be -- but a legitimate 
computer accessory, Lord knows, you're going to use for important stuff . 
</P>
<P>
 Programs currently available already run a gamut from the mundane to 
near-sublime. Would you like to walk through the National Gallery of London on 
your home computer? Have the phone company's white pages or yellow pages for 
the entire country encoded on a single slender compact disc? Browse an 
encyclopedia that comes with handy film clips and sound bytes? Remix a David 
Bowie song to specification? 
</P>
<P>
 Explore lavishly animated alternate worlds at your own pace? Play chess with 
characters that duke out your moves on the board? Watch an entire movie in 
miniature, with production notes scrolling alongside? Flip through an 
audiovisual business magazine? Study a Bible that has James Earl Jones speaking 
up occasionally and disconcertingly through your PC as the voice of God? 
Interactive catalogue shopping, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 No? You know you want it. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the future-shock glut now playing at an electronics store near you 
didn't give me plenty of doubts of my own about the format's long-term survival 
prospects before I made the leap. 
</P>
<P>
 Though never a Beta man myself, I do feel a certain loneliness as still the 
only laser-disc enthusiast on my block, and I plan to be the last to jump on 
the Mini-Disc or Digital Compact Cassette bandwagons, should there ever be one 
of either. I still have a defiant "convince me" attitude toward the formats 
that more or less are competitors to CD-ROM for America's hearts and minds, 
like CD-i (CD-interactive) and CD+G (CD-plus-graphics). 
</P>
<P>
 Such a quandary. The indefatigable collector in me finally started lusting 
after a CD-ROM drive after reading favorable reviews of recent interactive 
music releases by the likes of Peter Gabriel and the former Prince, as well as 
press releases about upcoming retrospective discs on everyone from Monty Python 
to Clint Eastwood to Bob Dylan. But the technophobe in me convincingly 
counterargued that life is already entertaining and difficult enough without 
spending untold hours learning new commands just to finally hear "Gett Off" or 
"You feel lucky, punk?" booming through my tinny computer speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 What about price, you (and I) ask? 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is, you can get a good external "double-speed" CD-ROM drive 
add-on for your computer for $225-$400 these days -- not bad as cutting-edge 
hardware goes. The bad news is, the software itself almost never comes cheap, 
usually costing anywhere from $35-$60 for discounted popular titles and more 
than $100 for some heavyweight discs. The good news is, thanks to the immense 
archival storage capacity of each disc, you sometimes get an awful lot of ROM 
for your charge slip. (Those national white pages come to mind.) 
</P>
<P>
 Myself, I was strictly a "DOS for Dummies" kind of guy a couple short months 
ago. But on a recent conspicuous-consumptive whim, I bought a new Power Mac 
with built-in CD-ROM drive (about $2,000), and topped off the shopping by 
bagging my first piece of CD-ROM software, Xplora: Peter Gabriel's Secret World 
($60). 
</P>
<P>
 Whoops: This was a pointedly arty, almost all-graphic CD-ROM, in which the 
intelligentsia could point and click on color codes and mysterious icons to 
proceed to the various Gabriel videos and song extracts and odes to African 
instruments. (Words, it seems, get in the aesthetic way.) Novices best start 
elsewhere -- though eventually I found that pointing 'n' clicking at random, 
not unlike the proverbial typing monkey, would get me through the disc in my 
own careening fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "game" aspect still proved frustrating: Sometimes I would click on 
some intriguing symbol and an ethereal Gabriel visage would pop up, teasing, 
"No, I'm sorry, you can't get in there without a pass." After the umpteenth 
blockage without the slightest idea which passing window might be the will-call 
where I could pick up my "pass," I found myself wanting to world-beat Peter on 
the head with a very big xylophone mallet. Sixty bucks I paid to have a 
hologram tell me I'm not on the guest list? 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, a computer-illiterate fool such as I was in need of something a 
little more elementary (i.e., text-based) to start with. 
</P>
<P>
 My follow-up purchase, "Cinemania '94," fit the bill handily. This disc, aimed 
at film buffs, allows you to type in one of any thousands of movie titles, then 
pick between the respective opinions of Maltin, Kael or Ebert, or get an 
instant bio and filmography on major actors and filmmakers. For the most 
popular films, you can pull up production credits, listen to a byte of scoring 
or dialogue, or for a few select titles, even watch a herky-jerky film clip. 
</P>
<P>
 My next stab at user-friendliness, Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia, proved 
a lot more fun than the encyclopedias I waded through as a kid, if only because 
I could call up video of J. F. K. asking us to ask not, or M. L. K. recounting 
his dream.  
</P>
<P>
 Next I was on to the most popular CD-ROM title of years past -- the Voyager 
edition of the Beatles' "A Hard Day's Night" that has the complete film 
unspooling in a small window on-screen, with access to the original draft of 
the script, critical notes or record-studio logs alongside the movie. Type in 
"Turn left at Greenland" or just "Greenland," and the disc will take you right 
to the spot in the movie where John Lennon answers the reporter's question, 
"How do you find America?" 
</P>
<P>
 Having successfully navigated these fab digital baby steps, I felt ready to 
again try my mousy hand at something challengingly interactive, something less 
literal and more instinctive: "Virtual Valerie." 
</P>
<P>
 Just kidding. Rather it was high time to check out Myst, the one CD-ROM title 
that has become a singular phenomenon.  
</P>
<P>
 The brilliance of Myst made me realize why CD-ROM is oddly perfect for adults 
and younger children alike, but will probably frustrate the Nintendo-trained 
teens in between: Like most games designed for the format, it moves very, very 
slowly, providing a tangible sense of exploration but no quick thrills. With 
few instructions, you move around a deserted island one lazy click at a time -- 
reflexes and/or coordination not required (a big plus, in my book) -- looking 
for clues amid the spookily lifelike illustrations to put together the "back 
story" yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 To hell with "winning": Improbably, I enjoyed clicking my way down to the Myst 
Island dock just to listen to the waves lap against the wood, or going up into 
the woods to hear the wind whistle through the trees, being in no hurry to best 
the 40 hours it's said to take an average person to get around the entire 
island. Myst is the first example I know of, in the computer realm, at least, 
of a stop-and-smell-the-roses game. 
</P>
<P>
 A bona fide new art form, as Wired magazine claims of Myst? Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 A nd yet, the complaints you hear about CD-ROM are basically true: The lag 
time between command and response does limit the possibilities for games. The 
film clips are tiny and ridiculously low-resolution, like live-action flip 
cards. Audio dropouts are common, at least on my system, as are annoying 
messages informing you your computer doesn't have enough memory to continue. 
The level of actual "interactivity" is more hype than reality, unless you're 
convinced having a gameskeeper or naked lady or the goofball formerly known as 
Prince lure you down animated corridors is the height of freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some holdouts -- like my not-quite-convinced colleague -- find these factors a 
barrier to buying in. As a new convert, I acknowledge the limitations and 
resolve to enjoy what's there, since it's more likely there'll be technological 
improvements to CD-ROM than it is a whole new format will set a different 
standard for home computer accouterments any year soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe I'm just rationalizing the extravagance of my new toy, because you 
know what? Defying all sense, I actually enjoy hearing "Gett Off" blast through 
my tinny little PC speaker.

 BEACHCOMBER? Walter W. (Bill) Knitz, the former general manager of the Santa 
Margarita Water District convicted of conflict-of-interest charges, is a model 
trash hauler and toilet cleaner at county-run beaches in Laguna Beach -- where 
he's performing part of his court-ordered 200 hours of community service. Knitz 
recently recovered a lost wallet with $117 inside, which was returned to its 
owner. . . . Says Mark Carlson, supervising park ranger. "Mr. Knitz is one of 
our better court referrals." 
</P>
<P>
 ARTISTS FOR ARTISTS: Not all the money for artwork sold at the ongoing Sawdust 
Festival in Laguna Beach goes into the artists' pockets. Many of them are 
donating pieces -- to help their fellow artists. . . . Paintings and ceramic 
pieces will be auctioned off at the festival today, to fill the coffers of the 
festival's Benevolence Fund. The fund helps out local artists facing financial 
hardship. Says a spokeswoman: "Many of those donating pieces can identify with 
that situation." 
</P>
<P>
 BROTHERLY LOVE: After 13 years as a Huntington Beach lifeguard, Lt. Mike 
Beuerlein finally has the schedule he wants -- Sundays off. Now he can watch 
his brother, Steve Beuerlein, quarterback the Arizona Cardinals. Both 
Beuerleins are from Fullerton and graduated from Anaheim's Servite High. Steve 
played football at Notre Dame; Mike, water polo at UC Irvine. . . . Says Mike: 
"For the first 11 years here I had to work weekends, then rush home and watch 
the highlights." 
</P>
<P>
 ELECTRONIC STAMPS: The post office in Irvine is getting help from a foe: the 
fax machine. Customers there -- one of two test markets nationally -- are now 
ordering stamps by fax and getting them in the daily mail. . . . "People love 
it," says Irvine Postmaster Jim Burns, who counts about 150 orders a day, 
mainly from businesses and the home-office crowd. Customers fax order forms and 
then pay the mail carrier later. The fax service is to go countywide Oct. 1.

 "The law is like a horse cart. It goes whichever way you turn it."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Old Russian proverb 
</P>
<P>
 The day Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia from a 20-year exile, a 
short, balding admirer with thick glasses and a weak heart struggled into the 
seaside crowd and handed the famous author a bouquet. Suddenly the two men were 
parted by the crush of other welcomers and they never met again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not get to speak to him," Viktor I. Cherepkov says in wistful 
recollection. "He did not notice whom the flowers were from. He did not even 
know who I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Cherepkov is -- legally, at least -- the mayor of Vladivostok. A retired 
submarine captain, he had quit the Communist Party in 1989 to embrace 
democratic politics. As the highest elected official in this Pacific port city, 
he should have shared the limelight with the celebrated crusader against the 
vanquished Soviet state. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new Russia is an unruly place. The 51-year-old mayor has been sprayed 
with Mace, locked in a car trunk and beaten unconscious as part of a power 
struggle with the appointed regional governor. Weeks before Solzhenitsyn's 
homecoming in May, Cherepkov lost control of City Hall when police carried him 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Two local newspapers that defended the mayor were temporarily shut down; a 
sympathetic journalist was tortured by thugs, then warned by the acting mayor 
to leave town. The pretext for Cherepkov's ouster, an allegation that he took 
bribes equaling $1,700, has been forgotten. A prosecutor has given back the 
rubles seized from him as "evidence" -- but not the powers of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years to the day after Communist hard-liners mortally wounded the Soviet 
Union with a failed putsch against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, its Russian 
successor state is so mired in lawlessness that the recent coup in this city of 
660,000 people caused barely a ripple elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is the totalitarian law under which Solzhenitsyn was imprisoned in the 
gulag nearly 50 years ago and later exiled for writing the truth about Soviet 
repression. Russia is freer, wilder, torn by contending powers and truths. 
Despite a new constitution promising Western-style legal order, the country 
resembles a federation of fiefdoms where regional political bosses, 
bureaucrats, army officers, police chiefs, prison wardens and mafia dons can 
bend the law or ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years ago we had different hopes, but I do not think those hopes were 
justified," said Sergei A. Kovalev, a gulag veteran and human rights champion 
in Parliament. "The country's political, economic and social atmosphere does 
not allow us to expect a breakthrough anytime soon toward the ideal of a state 
ruled by law." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an age-old lament. Rooted in Russia's 1,000-year history is an impulse 
to act above or outside the law. So is a talent for creating stifling 
bureaucracies to impose order on people's lives. And so is a fatalism that 
discourages Russians from resisting arbitrary rule, from controlling their own 
destinies. 
</P>
<P>
 As Russia lumbers away from seven decades of communism, these burdens weigh 
like an ancient, self-imposed yoke. The despots, outlaws and bureaucrats are 
impeding the growth of democracy and a free-market economy, and only slowly, 
painfully, are Russians mustering the independence of mind to overcome them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot say whether it is the character of the Russian nation which has 
formed such autocrats or whether it is the autocrats themselves who have given 
this character to the nation," mused a German diplomat in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron Herberstein of the Holy Roman Empire was writing to Vasily III, a 
16th-Century Russian czar. The riddle survives. "Leaders have never voluntarily 
parted with power in Russia," President Boris N. Yeltsin noted in memoirs 
published this year. "Why has this medieval principle enthralled us for so 
long?" 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the sheer force needed to hold such a vast territory together, to lead 
it anywhere, must be despotic by nature. Or maybe it is because Russia, then 
under Mongol rule, missed the Renaissance and was trapped in medieval ways. 
</P>
<P>
 While the czar claimed divine power, the law became whatever his appointed 
local despots decreed. Russians perfected the art of evading it. Peasants 
vanished into the wilderness to avoid tax collectors. Secret societies of 
smugglers and highwaymen thrived, surviving into the Soviet era to control 
black-market commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most enlightened czarist reform, which in 1864 created a modern court 
system with jury trials and rights for the accused, did not stop the czar's 
police from banishing anyone they deemed politically dangerous. Seizing power 
in 1917, the Bolsheviks banned juries and forged a new legal order. Law itself 
became an instrument with which to smash the enemies of the new socialist 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Marxist theory, the army, the police, the courts -- the law itself -- 
would "wither away" as citizens became disciplined Communists. To regiment the 
society, Josef Stalin killed at least 20 million of his own people. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin used similar logic for his tank assault on the Russian White House 
last October: Blow away the reform-resistant Soviet-era Parliament, elect a 
compliant one under a modern constitution . . . and coercion would become 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the pivotal summer of 1991, Russia is experiencing 
what passes for political and economic stability. Threats of hyper-inflation, 
hunger and social conflict have receded. People are busy changing jobs, buying 
shares of companies, scraping to save money. Consumption is up. Yeltsin's 
ideological foes are disorganized; his hold on power seems safe until the 1996 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But this apparent normalcy has a weak base. Like all its predecessors, the 
constitution drafted by Yeltsin and adopted by voters last December does not 
reign supreme. Its bill of rights is under attack in jurisdictions across the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Murtaza Rakhimov, an ethnic Bashkir who was elected president of the Russian 
republic of Bashkortostan on the day the constitution passed, launched a 
Stalinist-style crackdown three months later in Dyurtyuli, a Tatar-dominated 
town of 35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 His pretext was the March 9 grenade assassination of Mayor Razil Musin. Over 
the next several weeks, police rounded up more than 500 critics of Rakhimov, 
parading many of them in handcuffs through the streets and holding nearly 100 
for up to a month without charges. The schoolmaster, chief doctor and 16 other 
community leaders lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such wholesale repression is no longer common in Russia, Yeltsin's 
Human Rights Commission warned in its first report this summer of widespread, 
systematic abuses in the armed forces and in prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazing claimed the lives of 169 army conscripts last year. Police routinely 
beat criminal suspects to extract confessions. Pretrial detention centers are 
overcrowded and trial dockets so backed up that many inmates plead guilty just 
to get on with sentences in less-crowded prison camps. 
</P>
<P>
 One big difference from the old order is that the media can, and do, air such 
complaints. But most of the time, local authorities ignore the laments. And in 
a few cases -- in Klin, Arkhangelsk, Vladivostok and St. Petersburg -- critical 
newspapers or television programs have been shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 More than any other local boss, St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak 
personifies the gap between reformist ideals and undying autocratic ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected to the Soviet Parliament as a reformer in 1989, law professor Sobchak 
denounced the Russians' "astonishing indifference toward the law" and appealed 
brilliantly for a law-governed state. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected mayor in 1991, he became, by his own standard, an outlaw. He fired the 
elected deputy mayor. Ignoring the constitution, he raised the voting age from 
18 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobchak has also joined Moscow Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov in enforcing a Soviet-era 
residency requirement that had been struck down by the Constitutional Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The two mayors have expelled thousands of non-residents from their cities, 
many of them dark-skinned merchants. Sobchak justified his latest roundup, just 
before hosting the recent Goodwill Games, as a popular -- and therefore 
"democratic" -- anti-crime measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sobchak is acting in the finest Russian tradition," Leonid E. Kesselman, a 
St. Petersburg sociologist, said. "The man in power decides what the law is. He 
does not answer to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to alienate the police, army and regional bosses in a country that 
last year seemed headed for civil war, Yeltsin has taken few steps to enforce 
the civil liberties his constitution enshrines. In fact, he moved this summer 
to restrict those rights in a struggle against organized crime, identified by 
the Kremlin as public enemy No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordering the police to "cleanse Russia of criminal filth," Yeltsin signed a 
decree allowing them to hold suspected gangsters for up to 30 days without 
charges -- the constitutional limit is 48 hours -- and to search offices, 
vehicles and bank records without a court order. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown has touched off a furious debate that goes to the heart of 
Russia's lawless nature. Noting that Stalin's mass terror employed simplified 
court and police procedures, nearly every faction of Parliament joined in 
attacking the decree as an ominous infringement of individual rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's security chiefs, who get far more of his attention than does his 
Human Rights Commission, countered with the refrain that fighting crime is 
popular among Russians and therefore "democratic." 
</P>
<P>
 "Will there be violations of human rights?" asked Sergei V. Stepashin, the 
counterintelligence chief. "Probably, yes. But only in the interest of 99% of 
the population." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Russians have become so alarmed by the violent scramble for newly 
privatized businesses and natural resources that they may be willing to 
sacrifice their fragile new liberties to stop the contract killings and other 
felonies that plague every major city. In a survey by the weekly Moscow News, 
83% said Russia needs order more than it needs democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In another poll of Muscovites, 21% said the mafia controls the country; 5% 
thought Yeltsin does. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's own statistics give the impression that gangsters run things: 
5,600 criminal gangs with 150,000 illegal guns deal in drugs, oil, minerals, 
arms and money laundering across porous borders. They extort protection money 
from at least 70% of private companies, control a third of the turnover of 
goods and services, most of it untaxed, and transfer up to $1 billion a month 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminals killed 30 bankers and 183 policemen last year. Vladivostok, with a 
hilly terrain and a swagger like San Francisco's in its Gold Rush days, 
recorded 490 murders -- 23 more than similar-sized Washington, D.C. A member of 
Russia's Parliament was assassinated in a mob hit in May. Days later, another 
lawmaker killed a gangster in a shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by easy money and the high life of crime bosses, children raid cargo 
trains near the Chinese border, rip up bronze statues of heroes in St. 
Petersburg and sell the booty. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the West, you have this James Bond character, this gentleman who fights 
crime, but in Russia people admire the man who does evil," said Viktor A. 
Babchenko, the top anti-racketeering cop in Ekaterinburg, the mining, 
manufacturing and murder capital of the Ural Mountains. "They exaggerate his 
invulnerability, his wealth, his glamorous life." 
</P>
<P>
 Law officials say Yeltsin's crackdown has driven some mob bosses into hiding 
and encouraged more people to report crimes. But police are also committing 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with the new decree, police in the southern town of Novokuibyshevsk 
arrested Yuri Y. Shustanov, a geometry teacher and outspoken human rights 
activist, purportedly for defying a long-forgotten court summons over a 1992 
slander suit. More than a month later, he is still in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decree has untied their hands," his daughter Victoria said. "The police 
have become bold again and feel they can get away with anything." 
</P>
<P>
 A more serious criticism of the crackdown is that the government and the 
police may be too corrupt to wage it. Yeltsin's aides admit there are strong 
ties between gangsters and bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 A Moscow kiosk owner who refused to pay off racketeers found his rent hiked by 
the city administration, which owns all land in the capital. Criminals bribe 
real estate registrars to identify poor, elderly loners who have acquired their 
apartments from the state, then swindle them out of the property and murder 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There can be no organized crime without the support of organized state 
structures," said Sergei A. Pashin, a Yeltsin adviser on legal reform. 
"Everywhere the bureaucrat has power, there is fertile soil for organized 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows this better than the retailers who sell produce, clothing, 
cosmetics, toys and household appliances from hundreds of tiny outdoor stalls 
at Ekaterinburg's Central Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hundreds of thousands of street-level pioneers in Russia's capitalist 
economy, they lead a tense existence. They must pay rent and taxes to municipal 
bureaucrats, bribes to the police and protection money to the gangsters allowed 
to prey on them. And they must dodge the violent turf wars. 
</P>
<P>
 An upstart group of Afghan War veterans, who run a mix of legal and illegal 
businesses to finance charity work for war invalids, widows and orphans, took 
over the market's protection racket last spring by kidnaping the bureaucrat who 
runs the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Uralmash, the city's premier gang, exploded a couple of bombs and regained the 
racket two weeks later, then attacked some uncooperative traders. About 40 
large young men in warm-up suits attacked with metal rods, knocked over fruit 
stands and calmly jogged away, leaving 15 people injured.

<P>
 Standing outside the chain-link fence around the dusty market, a 27-year-old 
retired army captain who identified himself only as Sasha spoke with fear and 
resignation about the kind of society emerging from this lawlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to find any other work after the Soviet army pullout from Eastern 
Europe, Sasha earns a modest profit selling scarves, summer dresses and shoes 
he brings from Turkey on twice-a-month shopping trips organized by the 
gangsters who watch over him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that mafia groups have divided up the city narrows my opportunities 
as an entrepreneur," he said. "I can sell things only in places controlled by 
the group I pay. I'm afraid to imagine what might happen to me if I dared to 
cross into somebody else's territory. This cannot be called free and fair 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 But like many entrepreneurs, Sasha accepts a new order in which criminal 
behavior feeds on itself. Confronted with ineffective courts and indifferent, 
corrupt policemen, honest entrepreneurs turn to thuggish methods to collect 
debts and protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "To break this order would be painful and senseless," Sasha said. "People have 
never trusted the state. They would rather turn to tough guys with steel rods. 
The funny thing is that the state is beginning to like this attitude: They can 
say, 'People prefer to sort things out themselves.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fed up with the criminal atmosphere, voters turned last December to the tough 
guy of politics -- Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, a lawyer who promises to convene 
special tribunals and have criminals shot on the spot. His neo-fascist party 
won the second-largest bloc of seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the ideals of "free enterprise" and "democracy" so widely proclaimed 
three years ago have become so tarnished that a victory by some reactionary in 
the 1996 presidential election seems plausible. No longer able to count on 
leadership from the Kremlin, reformers warn that the road to a democratic, 
law-governed state will at best be slow and uneven, at worst interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, they say, it will depend on a new generation educated to assert 
its rights, to use the law as a means of defense, to shape new institutions 
that protect the individual from abuse by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Such buffers are forming here, but slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen regional legislatures that disbanded when Yeltsin destroyed the old 
Parliament in Moscow have yet to be restored through elections. The 
Constitutional Court, also suspended then for siding against Yeltsin, is still 
being restructured. Jury trials have returned to a few of Russia's regions. And 
Kovalev, the gulag veteran, has been named Russia's first ombudsman, or 
people's defender, but awaits Parliament's confirmation before he can open a 
complaint bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the generally uncritical support for Yeltsin from President 
Clinton and European leaders has deprived Russia's human rights movement of its 
most powerful weapon from the latter Soviet days -- public disapproval from the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, however, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh and Assistant U.S. Secretary 
of State John Shattuck traveled to Moscow to lobby for keeping Yeltsin's war on 
crime within Western standards of justice. Freeh hammered the point seven times 
in a half-hour lecture at the police academy. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the reformers say, is pressure from the Russian people. But 
the building blocks of a civil society -- independent political parties, trade 
unions, neighborhood organizations -- are few and weak. And some of the most 
energetic movements, such as the war vets in Ekaterinburg, have drifted into 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are waiting for a person who will do something for us," Solzhenitsyn 
scolded audiences across Russia during his homecoming rail journey from 
Vladivostok to Moscow. "We waited for the Communists, we waited for Stalin, we 
waited for the democrats and now we are waiting for you. We should stop talking 
and begin working."

Reform: What Was Supposed to Happen 
</P>
<P>
 In spring 1991, Boris N. Yeltsin, then chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the 
Russian Federation, ran for the newly created post of president of Russia, 
which was still part of the Soviet Union led by Mikhail Gorbachev. Yeltsin was 
by far the most radical pro-reform candidate, and his campaign set the stage 
for what he would try to accomplish in office. Yeltsin won the election with 
about 58% of the vote and has been in office more than three years. Here are 
some of the goals he set for Russia during his campaign: 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Institution of land reform by breaking up unprofitable state and collective 
farms and distributing land to individual farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduction of the massive military-industrial complex. 
</P>

 Legal Contradictions

<P>
 Russia's surge in lawlewlessness spurred President Boris N. Yeltsin to sign a 
wide-ranging anti-crime order this summer. But the decree, which restricts 
certain civil liberties guaranteed in the constitution, has drawn intense 
criticism. Some points where Yeltsin's decree and the constitution conflict: 
</P>
<P>
 YELTSIN'S DECREES 
</P>
<P>
 Gives security organs the right to detain suspects without a charge for 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Gives security organs the right to search apartments, offices and vehicles 
without a warrant, and makes evidence found during such searches admissible 
evidence in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Gives security organs the right to examine the bank accounts of any person 
suspected of illegal dealings, as well as of any relative living with this 
person for more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 CONSTITUTION 
</P>
<P>
 Says no person may be detained for more than 48 hours without a court order. 
</P>
<P>
 Says no has the right to enter someone's home without permission in cases 
stipulated by federal law or court. 
</P>
<P>
 Says that everyone has the right to privacy, and that telephone calls, mail, 
cables and other communications are private. Restrictions of this right require 
a court order.

CLOSED-DOOR POLICY FAILS TO STEM TIDE OF CUBANS; IMMIGRATION: COAST GUARD IS 
STILL PICKING UP RAFTS IN FLORIDA STRAITS. CASH REMITTANCES TO HAVANA ARE 
BANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after a stunning change in U.S. immigration policy intended to shut down 
the mounting exodus of Cubans heading for Florida on homemade boats, the flood 
of refugees continued unabated Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as President Clinton was announcing a package of measures aimed at 
ratcheting up the pressure on Cuban President Fidel Castro -- including banning 
all cash remittances to Cuba and placing new restrictions on flights -- the 
U.S. Coast Guard was rescuing more than 860 Cubans in the Florida Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees were being ferried to a tent city detention camp at the U.S. 
naval base at Guantanamo, Cuba, already home to more than 14,000 Haitian 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The new arrivals, along with 365 other Cubans being held at a U.S. Immigration 
and Naturalization Service detention center west of Miami, are the first to be 
affected by the policy reversal that has left Cubans subject to the same 
immigration rules that Haitians and other asylum-seekers face. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Krome Detention Center on the edge of the Everglades, about 300 
anxious Cuban Americans from South Florida gathered in the blazing sun, hoping 
to find the names of family members on a list of those being held inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "My 17-year-old brother left on a raft Wednesday with a cousin, his wife and 
two babies," said Julio Canto, 23, who himself rafted to South Florida three 
years ago. "We have no idea where he is now." 
</P>
<P>
 Although those on the list face detention rather than the immediate prospect 
of a new life in the United States, they did succeed in escaping death on the 
high seas. Some fleeing refugees in recent days did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno announced Thursday that Cuban migrants no longer would 
be welcomed routinely to the United States but would have to apply for asylum 
like other would-be immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was the Clinton Administration's response to a steadily growing 
crisis in which more than 8,700 Cubans have fled to Florida this year. That 
represents the largest number of Cuban refugees to attempt to sail here since 
the Mariel boat lift of 1980, when more than 125,000 Cubans arrived in South 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports from inside Cuba suggest that even those who may have heard of the 
U.S. detention policy -- and the news has been broadcast to Cuba by U.S. 
government-run Radio Marti and commercial Miami stations -- many on the 
economically strapped island prefer to take their chances at sea. Some 
apparently would even prefer detention at the Spartan Guantanamo encampment to 
staying in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafters, unimpeded by Cuban guards, reportedly were leaving beaches near 
Cojimar early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if the word's reached them or not, but the boats are still 
coming," said Coast Guard Petty Officer Amy Gaskill in Miami. "We're still 
picking up rafts." 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, Clinton formally ordered a ban on cash remittances to 
Cuba, effectively prohibiting Cuban Americans from sending money to relatives 
and friends on the island. U.S. officials estimated that these remittances -- 
which were permitted in amounts up to $300 every three months -- have totaled 
$500 million a year and have been an important source of hard currency for the 
Communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House also imposed new restrictions on charter flights to Cuba, 
effectively banning those that are expressly for family visits or tourism. Only 
humanitarian flights will be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the United States will try to "increase and amplify" its 
broadcasts to Cuba over Radio Marti and will take to the United Nations what 
U.S. officials claim is evidence of new human rights abuses by the Cuban 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's announcement of tighter sanctions against Cuba, which already faces 
a U.S.-led economic blockade, follows meetings Saturday with Florida Gov. 
Lawton Chiles and a group of Cuban American leaders. All had urged the 
President to balance his immigration order with tougher measures against 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely satisfied," said Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban 
American National Foundation. "I think the President has done the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's new series of measures adds up to a careful balancing act in his 
handling of Cuban American groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The curbs on refugees announced by the White House on Friday ran counter to 
the longstanding efforts of Cuban exile organizations, which have encouraged 
the broadest possible immigration from Cuba into the United States. But the 
package of other measures adopted Saturday is in line with other efforts by 
Cuban American groups, which have sought to tighten the trade embargo against 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview on Cable News Network, the Cuban Foreign Ministry denounced 
the Administration's actions. "The U.S. government in no way tackles the 
essence of the problem, which is the fact that there is a policy (the U.S. 
embargo of Cuba) deliberately aimed at making life unbearable in Cuba," said 
Carlos Fernandez, director of the ministry's North American section. "The 
natural and logical outcome is to have people wanting to leave the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Polls conducted by Miami television stations hours after details of the policy 
change were spelled out by Clinton indicate that a majority of South 
Floridians, including Cuban Americans, support the decision to detain Cuban 
refugees rather than allow them free entry. Many here believe that Castro was 
using the flotilla to relieve internal pressures caused by severe economic 
privation and growing social unrest that led to an Aug. 5 riot on the Havana 
waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were signs of disaffection too. In heavily Cuban Hialeah and in Key 
West, Cuban Americans took to the streets to protest the policy change. "Miami 
Si , Guantanamo No " read some signs. 
</P>
<P>
 For those left waiting in Miami for missing relatives to show up, both anger 
and anguish were close to the surface. "It's easy to say, 'I agree with the 
policy' when you don't have loved ones risking their lives for freedom," said 
Julio Canto's wife, Aida, near tears as she waited to see the list of those 
held at Krome. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who did not find their relatives at Krome could only hope that they 
would show up at Guantanamo. But there was no word Saturday on the identity of 
the 499 Cubans en route to the camp on Cuba's southeastern coast, and that too 
provoked frustration among those who waited. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to know if our family members are dead or alive," said Marlene 
Rodriguez, 28, a Miami schoolteacher who waited outside the Krome gate with her 
husband, Javier, for word of two cousins who left Mariel on Thursday. "My aunt 
in Artemisa (Cuba) is having a nervous breakdown. These are her two children 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Krome Detention Center, emptied of 172 illegal immigrants of other 
nationalities to make room for as many as 1,000 Cubans, the 223 men among the 
first 336 to arrive were segregated from the 76 women and 37 children. Men were 
housed in a large circus-type tent, while the women and children slept indoors. 
All wore bright orange camp uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 INS spokesman Lamar Wooley said the Cubans were being screened for health 
problems. He had no comment on what would happen to any refugee found 
ineligible to stay in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is something to be settled at a higher level."

CRIME BILL NEARS HOUSE FLOOR VOTE; CONGRESS: NEGOTIATORS IN MARATHON SESSION 
REPORT THEY ARE NEAR AGREEMENT ON STALLED MEASURE. TIRED LAWMAKERS CONVENE TO 
AWAIT FINAL WORDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A marathon effort to rescue President Clinton's endangered anti-crime bill 
appeared to gather momentum Saturday evening as Republican and Democratic 
negotiators reported that they were near agreement after haggling for the 
better part of two days over proposed funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The hopeful assessment that a deal could be struck in time to send a final 
anti-crime bill to the full House for a late-night floor vote came after the 
negotiations had appeared to stall over concessions demanded by Republicans and 
moderate Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Republicans rejected yet another set of proposed 
Democratic concessions as inadequate and differences emerged between the 
Democrats themselves over an assault weapon ban that Clinton has declared must 
stay in the bill, pared back to a cost of about $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The House, its members increasingly short-tempered as Democrats and 
Republicans accused one another of acting in bad faith, convened at noon 
Saturday and was standing by well into the evening waiting for the closed-door 
negotiations to produce a final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Many members, eager to begin a summer recess that has been delayed by 
legislative impasses over the anti-crime bill and health care reform, were 
clearly willing to vote on almost any bill that could make its way to the House 
floor by today. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, in his weekly radio address to the nation, appealed for 
swift action to pass what he characterized as "the toughest" anti-crime 
legislation ever taken up by Congress. The Administration's initiative contains 
funds for prison construction, new police hires and a variety of crime 
prevention programs. It also would ban the sale of 19 categories of 
semiautomatic assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must not let this chance pass by," Clinton said, appealing for bipartisan 
support to overcome strong opposition from many Republicans and a significant 
number of Democrats. "We must seize the opportunity before us to make a 
dramatic difference in every neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 While significant progress was made when Democrats agreed to further cuts in 
crime prevention programs criticized by Republicans as "pork," House leaders 
said after emerging from an all-night negotiating session early Saturday that 
the two sides still had some differences. The sticking points included 
provisions relating to rape prosecutions and early release of nonviolent drug 
offenders to make room in crowded prisons for violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations resumed late in the morning and dragged on into the day, 
stretching tempers to the breaking point and sparking disagreements on other 
points. The new disputes included GOP demands for procedures to expedite the 
deportation of criminal immigrants and a "truth in sentencing" proposal that 
would deny prison funding to states that fail to make repeat violent offenders 
serve at least 85% of their jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential snag emerged when some Democrats opposed to the assault 
weapon ban pressed for changes that would delay its implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We solve one thing and another thing comes up," complained an exasperated 
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) "It's like nailing Jell-O to the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 As the day wore on, the negotiators continued to predict that a compromise 
eventually would be reached -- not so much because of Clinton's appeal for 
bipartisan cooperation but because of legislative fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just want to get out of here. It's exhaustion at this point," said 
Rep. Philip R. Sharp (D-Ind.), one of many lawmakers who were waiting in the 
wings for the negotiators to bring the revised anti-crime bill back to the 
House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at the point where I'll vote for almost anything to end this and go 
home," another lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhaustion -- and the knowledge that control of the House and Senate next year 
could turn on the fate of the anti-crime bill -- appeared to be the motivating 
force behind a key concession made by Democrats to a group of Republicans led 
by Rep. Michael N. Castle, former governor of Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few days, the White House has made successively larger offers to 
cut the bill's $30-billion price tag in an effort to attract the votes of about 
40 moderate Republicans in the Castle-led group. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the formula the two sides finally agreed on, about $3.3 billion would be 
cut from the bill, with $2.5 billion of that coming from crime prevention 
programs and $800 million from funds for new prison construction and more 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.5-billion cut, which would reduce funding for the crime prevention side 
of the package to about $5 billion, would be accomplished by jettisoning a 
youth job training initiative and cutting remaining "social" programs in the 
bill by about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the ratio of money spent on the crime prevention provisions favored 
by liberals would drop to $1 for every $6 spent on the law enforcement programs 
favored by conservatives in the scaled-back bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ratio did not sit well with liberal lawmakers, especially the 37 
members of the Congressional Black Caucus. But the spending concessions 
appeared to be the only way the bill could muster enough Republican support to 
get around a roadblock erected by some 50 Democrats who opposed the assault 
weapon ban -- the provision for which Clinton has fought the hardest and 
invested the most presidential prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic gun control opponents seethed over Clinton's sharp criticism of 
their tactics. One of them, Rep. Bill Brewster (D-Okla.), said he sent the 
White House an angry letter defending gun ownership and denying the President's 
portrayal of the group as lawmakers who had "run from their responsibilities . 
. . and taken the easy way out." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign that the fight over the bill's gun control provisions was not over, 
a Democratic source said that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks 
(D-Tex.) was seeking legislative changes that would delay implementation of the 
assault weapon ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the ban is modified slightly, the source said, it would not be dropped 
from the bill unless the effort to reach an agreement with moderate Republicans 
fails and "we have to come back here next week and do the whole thing over 
again with a different approach."

KEY PROSECUTORS IN WHITEWATER PROBE MAY QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM C. REMPEL and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite concerted efforts by new Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. 
Starr to prevent internal turmoil, key prosecutors who have been directing the 
investigation of President Clinton's financial affairs are troubled by the 
recent court-ordered change of counsels and intend to quit after the 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
 The departures, if they occur as expected, would include some of the 
investigative team's top prosecution attorneys. Such resignations could disrupt 
an investigation that was believed to be nearing its first criminal 
indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with the change at the top, the departures can be expected to push 
back completion of the investigative phase to the threshold of the 1996 
presidential campaign, a concern when the Whitewater inquiry was initiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, there is concern that nervous witnesses will be alarmed by the 
changes and that some parts of the investigation may have to be repeated. 
"There are a number of practical implications that the court (which named 
Starr) completely ignored," one source close to the investigation charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, a Republican and former solicitor general in the George Bush 
Administration, was appointed on Aug. 5 by a three-judge federal panel to 
replace Robert B. Fiske Jr., who had led the investigation since its inception 
seven months ago. The panel said it was wary of retaining a special counsel who 
had been put on the case by a member of the Clinton Administration, Atty. Gen. 
Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then Starr himself has come under fire for his Republican ties and 
activities. His critics cite his personal and financial support of GOP 
candidates in Virginia and his televised statements opposing the President's 
claim to immunity from a sexual-harassment suit. He also helped draft a related 
legal brief for a conservative women's organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democratic lawmakers and some newspaper editorial pages have called on 
Starr to resign, saying he will taint the independent investigation's outcome 
with suspicions of political partiality. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to keep the investigation on track and forestall wholesale staff 
defections, Starr asked the entire unit to remain on the case and give him a 
chance to prove that he is bringing no political agenda to the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, according to sources close to the investigation, Starr's appeals seem 
to have had only limited success -- and for reasons largely beyond his control. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the current team regarded Fiske with great loyalty, making his abrupt 
replacement a source of disillusionment and resentment. The attorneys are known 
to regard themselves not so much as members of the Whitewater team but as 
members of Fiske's team. Half of the 10-member attorney group were recruited 
from the New York law offices of Davis, Polk & Wardwell, where Fiske is a 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, there are concerns that continuing political attacks on Starr 
threaten the investigation's credibility and mean that its final conclusions 
might not be judged on their legal merits. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the possibility that some investigative work may have to be repeated for 
the new leadership -- some of it for the fourth time, following earlier aborted 
probes by the local U.S. attorney and the Justice Department -- raises 
practical problems that could undermine the confidence of witnesses and work to 
the advantage of future defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr is to meet this week with Fiske and his team in Little Rock, Ark., where 
one phase of the investigation is under way. Sources say he has offered to "go 
on bended knee" to ask the attorneys to stay beyond an anticipated two-month 
transition period. 
</P>
<P>
 Associates of Starr say he can be very persuasive, and he apparently hopes 
that time will help his cause with members of the Fiske team. He reportedly has 
deflected early attempts by some members of the team to meet and declare their 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Preventing staff turbulence may be additionally important because Starr has 
not been able to immediately detach himself from his private law firm and may 
still have some legal work to complete for clients. Fiske severed his law firm 
ties after appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his Washington law firm Friday after returning from three days in 
Little Rock, Starr declined comment on the expected departures. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a Starr associate who declined to be identified said their 
resignations "will hurt only if they leave prior to an orderly transition." He 
said Fiske had assembled a "first-flight investigative team." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske has pledged to "do everything I can to help" Starr take over the reins 
of the Whitewater inquiry. In an interview before leaving to celebrate his 40th 
wedding anniversary last week, Fiske said he has encouraged his team to "stay 
long enough to assure minimal disruption" of the case. He said "long-term 
commitments are up to each individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades ago, a similar dilemma faced members of the Watergate special 
prosecution force after President Richard Nixon ordered the firing of special 
prosecutor Archibald Cox in the infamous "Saturday Night Massacre." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, like Starr a former solicitor general, was replaced by Leon Jaworski, 
widely regarded as a political crony of ex-President Lyndon B. Johnson and a 
Democratic political activist in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 But in that case, Jaworski soon won over the team that revered Cox, and it 
remained intact. Their inquiry led to the "smoking gun" tape that incriminated 
Nixon in the cover-up and forced his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Houston trial lawyer Rusty Hardin, a part-time member of the Fiske 
team, is one who may stay. 
</P>
<P>
 After talking with Starr privately on a trip from Little Rock to Texas 
following their first staff meeting, Hardin immediately telephoned his 
colleagues on the Fiske team to reassure them about Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view he does not have a (political) agenda," Hardin said he told them. 
"I believe he will be driven by the law and what's right and that he'll be 
honest with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardin confirmed that the unit was "within weeks" of deciding on the first 
round of indictments in the Little Rock phase of the investigation. He said the 
changes have already caused delays, but he was optimistic that important 
decisions could still be made before the end of September. He would not discuss 
the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardin also defended Fiske, who he said was unfairly criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who feared that Fiske wasn't being aggressive enough are dead wrong," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He minimized the effects of additional delays on possible future legal cases. 
"Ultimately, the results are going to be the same because all you need is a 
bright, independent type running the case and a good staff of prosecutors. 
Starr inherits a hard-working staff that did great work for Fiske, and he can 
build on what they've done." 
</P>
<P>
 During its first seven months, the Fiske investigation operated in two arenas 
-- Washington and Little Rock. The Washington phase looked into the suicide of 
White House aide and longtime Clinton associate Vincent Foster and a series of 
questionable contacts between the White House and federal regulators 
investigating Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, the failed Arkansas thrift owned 
by a business partner of the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 In Little Rock, meanwhile, the investigation developed thousands of pages of 
statements from witnesses, grand jury testimony and subpoenaed documents 
related to the broad question of whether Madison Guaranty was manipulated to 
benefit the Clintons' investment in the Whitewater real estate development 
and/or then-Gov. Clinton's state political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after his arrival in Arkansas, Fiske accepted a plea agreement with 
former Municipal Judge David Hale, who operated his own loan company and is 
accused of defrauding the federal Small Business Administration. Hale, who said 
he made improper loans to "members of the political family" of Arkansas at 
Clinton's urging, agreed to cooperate with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The first round of Little Rock indictments were expected to spring from the 
testimony and documents provided by Hale. 
</P>
<P>
 The team directing the Whitewater investigation includes three former federal 
prosecutors, Denis McInerny, Julie O'Sullivan and Mark Stein. Each served for 
at least four years as assistant U.S. attorneys in New York, where Fiske 
himself had been a U.S. attorney during the Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The three, along with attorneys Pat Smith and Tim White, also worked for 
Fiske's New York law firm. Other attorneys on the team are William Duffey of 
Atlanta; Roderick Lankler of New York, who worked on the Washington phase of 
the inquiry; Carl Stich of Cincinnati, and Gabrielle Wolohojian of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardin is a trial lawyer who met regularly with the team but did not 
participate in the day-to-day aspects of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure on Starr to step down continued even as he is trying to get the 
investigation restarted. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), leader of the drive to restore the independent 
counsel law and chairman of the Senate subcommittee with jurisdiction over the 
legislation, said Friday that he was "exploring options" after the three-judge 
panel that appointed Starr rejected his request to inquire into Starr's 
partisan activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue here is the credibility of this statute and the confidence the 
public will have in the results of these investigations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In accepting the appointment, Starr pledged to conduct a fair and thorough 
probe. "The nation has a compelling interest in the fair, just, thorough and 
prompt disposition of these matters pursuant to the Constitution and the laws 
of the United States," Starr said. "That is my sole loyalty."

HEALTH REFORM TANGLED UP IN A KNOT OF DEAL-KILLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As President Clinton and members of Congress search for some kind of consensus 
on health care reform, they find themselves stumped by a seemingly insoluble 
political equation: The potential areas of agreement range from slim to none, 
but the list of probable deal-killers grows ever longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider these scenarios: Senior citizens will walk away if Congress doesn't 
give them prescription drugs and long-term care. America's biggest corporations 
will fight to the end any effort to let states write their own rules for 
regulating employee health benefits. Doctors demand the right to join any 
managed-care network they choose, but health maintenance organizations will 
bolt if they can no longer select the doctors they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the President and Democratic congressional leaders are holding out 
for a future employer mandate that would force most firms to pay for a portion 
of their workers' health insurance if the percentage of Americans with coverage 
doesn't increase in the interim. But every Republican in Congress -- and a 
significant number of Democrats -- will vote against any bill that contains 
such a mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Add it all up and the probability of a major health care reform bill becoming 
law this year appears increasingly minuscule. And while many participants in 
the debate are willing to let the reform effort expire, for this year at least, 
it would be a bitter pill for Clinton, who has made health care reform the 
cornerstone of his domestic policy agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "No bill at all is better than a bad bill," said James Klein, who heads the 
Assn. of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, a coalition of big firms that 
provide workers with comprehensive benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, the group's members were enthusiastic backers of health care 
reform. They were particularly anxious to have an employer mandate, which would 
help curtail the problem of cost-shifting by health care providers. Experts 
estimate that businesses offering generous health benefits are being billed an 
extra $26 billion a year by hospitals and doctors to help cover the costs 
incurred by workers at firms that provide no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the current proposals from the Democratic leadership in both the House and 
Senate would inflict "tremendous damage" on employers by allowing states to 
create their own rules for corporate benefits, Klein said. A mosaic of up to 50 
sets of regulations could become an administrative nightmare for companies 
operating in multiple states, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The management of IBM Corp. is so disturbed by the prospect of a patchwork 
regulatory system that it has taken the extraordinary step of sending computer 
messages to its 110,000 workers, urging them to contact members of Congress to 
oppose the House and Senate bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The changing calculus of health care reform has suddenly placed Klein and the 
leaders of Fortune 500 corporations in a surprising alliance with the 
small-business lobby that is leading the charge against the employer mandate. 
Not long ago, the captains of industry heaped scorn on small-business 
proprietors, calling them "free riders" who let other people pick up the cost 
of their workers' health care. 
</P>
<P>
 On the growing list of potential health care deal-killers, the employer 
mandate still occupies the top slot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic leadership bill under consideration in the House would make all 
companies pay 80% of the cost of employee health coverage. The Senate 
leadership plan contains a softer mandate. It would rely initially on voluntary 
measures, including billions of dollars in government subsidies, to help 
provide coverage to those who lack it. The mandate would be imposed only in 
states where coverage does not rise to 95% of the population by the year 2000. 
In those states, starting in the year 2002, businesses with more than 25 
workers would be required to pay 50% of the cost of employee coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 To small-business owners, the House plan is viewed as the policy equivalent of 
arsenic -- instantly lethal -- while the Senate bill is seen as a 
slower-acting, but still deadly, political potion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another example of government interference -- we don't trust them to put 
together a system that will work," said John Motley, chief lobbyist for the 
National Federation of Independent Business, whose 600,000 members have been 
applying intense grass-roots pressure on members of Congress to kill the 
mandate once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way the mandates will be won is on sheer political force, overriding 
the interests of the business groups," said David B. Kendall, an analyst with 
the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Disturbed by the mandate, as well as the prospect of a costly new prescription 
drug benefit, a bipartisan group of approximately 20 senators who call 
themselves the "mainstream coalition" proposed a drastically stripped-down bill 
Friday. It eliminates the employer mandate altogether and would trim $400 
billion from future growth of Medicare and Medicaid over 10 years in order to 
generate funds to help poor people buy health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also calls for a number of insurance reforms. Companies could no 
longer deny or cancel coverage on the basis of a customer's health. All health 
plans would be available to all applicants. Policy renewals would be 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance reforms such as these are supported by just about everyone involved 
in the health care debate, including Clinton and Senate Republican leader Bob 
Dole. But the President and most Democrats also insist on pursuing their more 
ambitious goal of expanding coverage to the 37 million Americans who now lack 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies Dilemma No. 1 for Clinton. He can't win in the Senate without the 
support of the "mainstream" moderates. But the plan they offered is 
unacceptable to Clinton's staunchest labor and liberal allies because it falls 
far short of his pledge to provide a generous panoply of benefits to every 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland sent a letter Friday to every Democratic 
senator, urging them to "defend and strengthen" the Democratic leadership bill. 
Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), one of the chamber's most outspoken liberals, 
denounced the "mainstream" plan as a mistaken effort that "would fail to make 
health insurance affordable for working people." 
</P>
<P>
 And even if Clinton could swallow something less than an employer mandate, 
many members of Congress clearly could not. Among congressional liberals, at 
least 100 House Democrats and 20 senators are urging the President to stand 
fast. Many of these members originally supported a single-payer system of 
universal coverage in which private health insurance would disappear and the 
government would reimburse hospitals and doctors with tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The President long ago dismissed the single-payer formula as politically 
impossible. But he still needs the votes of the single-payer caucus, and its 
members say they won't accept any plan that does not include an employer 
mandate and a comprehensive benefit package with mental health coverage, 
preventive care and other coverage provided by big companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, it doesn't make any sense to support the bill," warned Rep. 
Jim McDermott (D-Wash.), leader of the single-payer group. "Then you're not 
doing health care reform, but just moving the deck chairs on the Titanic. 
Embroidering around the edges is nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott said he believes that the House leadership bill, crafted by Majority 
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), can hold the single-payer advocates because 
it includes a hard mandate. But he doubts whether the group would vote for the 
Senate package, designed by Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), because 
it would impose no mandate for at least eight years, and only then in some 
states but not others. "It still leaves 25 million people without health 
insurance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilemma No. 2 revolves around the powerful senior citizens lobby. After a 
special meeting last week, a council of 35 groups that represent the elderly 
declared its opposition to any health care bill that does not contain 
prescription drug coverage and financial help for Americans who require 
long-term care. Both drugs and long-term care would represent significant 
expansions of federal benefits -- and the cost of providing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Congress who vote against the proposed new benefits for the elderly 
"will see their votes dog them the rest of their political lives," threatened 
Dan Schulder, director of legislation for the National Council of Senior 
Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, senior groups expressed disdain for the "mainstream" plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It uses very deep Medicare cuts to fund other things," said John Rother, 
director of legislation for the 33-million-member American Assn. of Retired 
Persons. "From the senior point of view, it is all pain and no gain." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ritz, a spokesman for the 5-million-member National Committee to Preserve 
Social Security and Medicare, denounced the "mainstream" plan as a "shocking" 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying to squeeze Medicare and senior citizens to cover the 
uninsured," he said. His group isn't happy, either, with the official 
Democratic leadership plans. Although those plans offer prescription drug and 
long-term care benefits, they require some Medicare cuts too. "They ask too 
much of seniors," Ritz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilemma No. 3 arises from the many physicians and medical societies who see an 
opportunity in health care reform to limit the increasing power of health 
maintenance organizations and other managed-care networks operated by 
commercial insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurers, backed by many employers, say their ability to rein in rising 
medical costs will be undermined if they lose the freedom to screen the doctors 
they sign up, monitor their work, and throw out those who perform too many 
medical procedures or authorize too many tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, we think they put the emphasis not on quality, but on costs," said 
James Stacey, a spokesman for the American Medical Assn. One sign of growing 
antagonism: The Texas Medical Society has sued Aetna and Prudential, two of the 
biggest managed-care firms, for dismissing doctors from their networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Many doctors want the health care reform bill to include an "any willing 
provider" rule, which would require that networks accept any doctor who is 
willing to work for their fee schedules. But the Group Health Assn., which 
represents health maintenance organizations, insists that an "any willing 
provider" rule would add as much as $1,284 a year to the average cost of a 
family insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 California has the highest HMO penetration of any state, and leading networks 
recently warned in a letter to the state's congressional delegation that 
premiums could rise by as much as 28% if they lose their exclusive power to 
pick doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Other unresolved conflicts facing health care reform advocates include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Higher-cost health plans. The mainstream group and other moderates want to 
restrict the ability of businesses to claim tax deductions for high-priced 
health plans. Their proposal is opposed vigorously by corporations that offer 
top-of-the-line benefits and unions whose members receive them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cost controls. The Administration wants standby price controls, which would 
limit insurers' ability to raise premiums. The insurance companies say this 
would interfere with free-market forces and cripple their ability to raise 
funds needed to operate high-quality medical service networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the Administration unravel these dilemmas and assemble a winning 
coalition? To an increasing number of insiders, it looks highly doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to form a marriage, but it may be a shotgun wedding," said Sen. 
John B. Breaux (D-La.), a key moderate and skilled deal-maker who so far has 
been unable to find the middle ground on health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is lamenting the paradox facing Clinton and his allies. 
Republican lawmakers are gleeful, convinced they are dealing with a weakened 
President who has lost the confidence of the country on the complex health care 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 As Senate debate moved along at a glacial pace last week, Sen. Bob Packwood 
(R-Ore.) chortled over the Democrats' hapless efforts to make their bill 
palatable enough to pass. The entire exercise, he said, reminded him of the 
movie "Weekend at Bernie's," in which two young friends try to camouflage the 
condition of a deceased employer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids keep changing the clothes, but the body is still dead," he said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; WHITE HOUSE PRESSURE TACTICS AIMED AT CASTRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since the end of the Cold War, U.S. foreign policy and intelligence 
officials have talked quietly about possible scenarios for the downfall of 
Fidel Castro's Cuban regime, which had long depended on economic subsidies from 
the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you deal with the end of it (Castro's government)?" mused one U.S. 
official last year. "Do you keep the pressure on or do you suddenly release 
it?" Another senior official suggested that an easing of the U.S. trade embargo 
against Cuba might be a good idea, "not to perpetuate Castro's rule but, in 
fact, to soften the landing of its inevitable end." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the Clinton Administration's sudden ban on accepting refugees from 
Cuba, the U.S. government has taken a series of steps that appear designed to 
bring about lasting political change in Cuba. The goal is to hasten Castro's 
demise or, at a minimum, force him to open up his Communist regime. "What we 
need is movement toward democracy and a free economy," the President explained 
as he announced the historic new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the Administration's new policy looks as if it is aimed simply 
at stopping refugees. And that may well be a primary motivation for Clinton -- 
who, as governor of Arkansas, was forced to call out the National Guard to stop 
rioting by Cuban refugees detained there after the Mariel boat lift of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another, broader foreign policy component as well. Administration 
officials acknowledge privately that Friday's sweeping shift in refugee policy 
was designed to make sure that Cubans who are unhappy with life under Castro 
stay inside the country instead of emigrating to the United States. The hope is 
that if they are in Cuba, they might work for political change. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional steps announced by the White House on Saturday -- including 
restricting the flow of money Cuban Americans have been sending to relatives on 
the island and limiting charter flights to Cuba -- make it clearer than ever 
that the Administration's new policy is aimed as much at putting pressure on 
Castro as it is at stopping the immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to try to encourage a peaceful evolution to a democracy with free 
markets," one Administration policy-maker acknowledged Saturday in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it (Cuba) is a failed regime which is continuing political and 
economic repression, and which does not have the support of the Cuban people. . 
. . In general, we want to try to find ways to support independent groups in 
Cuba in any way that is lawful and peaceful, and we will continue to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Releasing refugees has, in the past, served as a safety valve for Castro, 
permitting him to maintain political stability by getting rid of those who 
might make trouble inside Cuba. By refusing to accept these people as 
immigrants, the Clinton Administration is now, in effect, trying to see if the 
nucleus of political opposition to Castro can be headquartered inside Cuba, 
rather than in the Cuban exile community in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The development of an anti-Castro opposition headquartered inside Cuba instead 
of Miami is a change that many U.S. experts on Cuba have been recommending. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the Miami exile leaders are seen as the U.S. government's 
preferred alternative to Castro, there will be no political consensus in Cuba 
for change, no matter how much legitimacy Castro loses," said Smith College 
professor Andrew Zimbalist in Foreign Policy magazine last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the U.S. intelligence community believes that Castro is in trouble, 
it has not been predicting his imminent downfall. Last March, when members of 
the Senate Intelligence Committee asked the question of Lt. Gen. James R. 
Clapper Jr., the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the answer was a 
qualified yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the Castro regime has experienced serious economic pressures over the 
past three to five years, the regime has managed to retain political control 
and prevent the total collapse of the economy thus far," Clapper answered in 
writing. "It is very likely that Fidel Castro will still be in power one year 
from now." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pentagon's intelligence chief quickly added this qualification: "It is 
possible that the regime could miscalculate in its handling of events or a 
series of events leading to popular uprisings, which, if mishandled by the 
internal security apparatus, could escalate out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the sudden new exodus of refugees from Cuba is apparently being viewed in 
Washington not just as a refugee crisis in Florida but also as an event that 
could, if handled right, lead to some sort of political change in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 All sorts of political dilemmas confront Clinton in managing a possible 
transition from Castro's Communist regime to some other Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Clinton wants to refrain from antagonizing the leaders of Cuban 
American organizations in Miami, who could cause the President political 
trouble in Florida. Yet he also wants to avoid giving too much power and 
prominence to the exile groups, which could at some point stand in the way of 
efforts to promote a broad-based Cuban government that would enjoy popular 
support on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it (Cuba policy) is not run out of Washington, it's going to be run out of 
Miami," warned one senior U.S. official early last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earliest days of his Administration, Clinton skirmished with Cuban 
exile groups -- and the exiles won. 
</P>
<P>
 The new President tried to appoint Mario Baeza, a Wall Street lawyer who was 
born in Cuba but lives in New Jersey, as his assistant secretary of state for 
Latin American affairs. But the leading exile group, the Cuban American 
National Foundation, opposed the nomination on grounds that Baeza had attended 
a trade conference in Cuba. They feared he would support an easing of the 
embargo against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton backed away from Baeza and instead appointed a foreign service 
officer, Alexander F. Watson, as the assistant secretary of state for Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the past 18 months, much of the debate about Cuban policy has 
centered on what to do about the trade embargo. In private, some U.S. officials 
have argued unsuccessfully for an easing of the embargo, on grounds that it 
would help form a smoother and more gradual transition to a new Cuban 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer this goes on, the longer we wait for something to crack, the more 
like Romania this is going to look than, say, Czechoslovakia," said one U.S. 
official. One of the worst scenarios involving Castro's downfall, he said, 
would be "civil war on the island with a lot of people killed . . . (and with) 
Cuban Americans getting immediately involved." 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1989, Romania's Communist regime toppled with a sudden and extremely 
bloody coup against its longtime president, Nicolae Caeusescu, who was killed 
by a military firing squad. By contrast, Czechoslovakia eased peacefully to a 
non-Communist government when Party Secretary Milos Jakos and other top 
Communist officials resigned en masse. 
</P>
<P>
 However, those in favor of easing the trade embargo against Cuba remain in the 
minority within the U.S. government. The dominant view within the Clinton 
Administration, like its predecessors, is that the embargo will keep the 
pressure on Castro and hasten his downfall in a way that will be manageable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underlying strategy is to convert economic crisis into social discontent, 
and then to give a political expression to that discontent," William I. 
Robinson, a Latin America policy analyst at the University of New Mexico, wrote 
last year. "Such a three-step sequence -- from economic crisis to social crisis 
to political crisis -- is premised on permanent economic attrition." 
</P>
<P>
 By clamping down on Cuban immigration to the United States, Clinton now seems 
to be trying to hasten movement along this path, pushing Cuba toward social and 
political crises.

AS CHANGE AGAIN OVERTAKES COMPTON, SO DO TENSIONS; COMMUNITY: LATINO PLURALITY 
SEEKS POWER. A GENERATION AFTER WINNING IT, BLACKS FIND BIAS CHARGES A BITTER 
PILL.

<P>
 Three decades ago, Compton's African American majority ousted the city's 
entrenched white leadership in a heated battle that reflected the social tumult 
of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, the tough city in south Los Angeles County was the most populous 
community west of the Mississippi where blacks held political sway, a national 
symbol of political empowerment despite its persistent poverty. Here, refugees 
from the Jim Crow South acquired their piece of the American Dream, using the 
ballot box to overcome discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a grainy video image of a black police officer beating a Latino teen-ager 
has given impetus to cries for a new political revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, those alleging discrimination are Latinos -- now the presumed 
majority in an extraordinary demographic shift after the massive emigration 
from Mexico and Central America that accelerated in the early 1980s. The 
much-publicized allegations of racial prejudice have galvanized Latinos' 
demands for power in a city where blacks have a lock on city government, a 
beleaguered school system and most municipal jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is racism perpetuated by one minority group against another," said Pedro 
Pallan, a 60-year-old baker and unsuccessful council candidate who has been one 
of the most outspoken Latino advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar has created a besieged atmosphere in City Hall, polarized black and 
Latino leaders whose constituents have generally enjoyed cordial relations, and 
left African Americans in the ironic position of responding to allegations of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hard pill to swallow," said Police Chief Hourie L. Taylor, who is 
black. His 125-officer department, at the vortex of the swirling controversy, 
includes 14 Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton's embattled black leadership has responded angrily to the challenge, 
dismissing allegations of discrimination while characterizing Latino activists 
as a self-serving clique of non-resident merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as a well-constructed attempt to utilize the historical 
implications of the African American civil rights movement for the benefit of a 
few people, who in fact probably don't even consider themselves nonwhite," said 
Mayor Omar Bradley, a 36-year-old high school English teacher and Compton 
native. "This is really all about power and privilege." 
</P>
<P>
 The black-brown dispute may provide a glimpse into the potential for future 
political upheaval in many Southern California communities where immigration 
has drastically altered the demographic mix. Compton is one test case in the 
politics of the new Southland, an indication of bumpy times ahead as newcomers' 
demands clash with established power blocs resistant to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite the supercharged rhetoric, some see an opportunity for 
cooperation and coalition-building. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to have a more inclusionary, larger political vision," said Joe 
R. Hicks, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of 
Greater Los Angeles, an African American civil rights group. "This is really an 
issue of poor folks struggling over jobs and opportunities. . . . Unless you 
have a vision of human relations as quite inclusionary, you end up circling the 
wagons, and lobbing hand grenades at each other in what is seen as racial or 
ethnic interest. We all lose in that scenario." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some African American clerics and others in Compton have called on 
politicians to open up their city to Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are today the entrenched group trying to keep out intruders, just as 
whites were once the entrenched group and we were the intruders," said the Rev. 
William R. Johnson Jr., pastor of Curry Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spearheading the call for political change is a vocal group of Latino leaders, 
mostly merchants, who have formed Latinos United Coalition of Compton, headed 
by Pallan, a longtime activist who has the most political experience. Also 
included in the organization are a grocery store owner, a juice shop operator, 
a real estate investor and a lawyer. Participants meet in the back room of a 
Mexican restaurant to discuss strategy, assisted by national Latino groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos are pressing several demands, including creation of a civilian board 
to review police behavior, a federal investigation into racial and ethnic 
conflict in the city, and establishment of an affirmative action and 
job-training program targeted toward increasing Latino participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Black officials have tended to paint the coalition as "outside agitators," in 
the words of several top city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnulfo Alatorre, one of the coalition leaders, acknowledges that he resides 
in nearby Downey, but adds that his Compton grocery store has been in business 
for years and that he lived in Compton for most of his life. He and other 
commuting businessmen view their presence in Compton as crucial to a city with 
high unemployment and a low tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alatorre and his allies face a major hurdle. The vast majority of Latinos 
are believed to be non-citizens and therefore unable to vote in elections 
dominated by the black middle class, including many civic-minded elderly who 
migrated from the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Latino coalition members, mostly U.S.-born and middle class, are 
more politically advanced than the immigrant population whom they seek to 
represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Among new immigrants, major concerns tend to focus on providing for families 
in an environment rife with gang warfare and street crime, and ensuring that 
their children get good educations in a school system lacking bilingual 
personnel and troubled by clashes between black and Latino high school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we live only to live," said Graciela Munoz, a mother of seven from 
Mexico, who was having an impromptu birthday celebration for a daughter at a 
fast-food emporium. "One feels useless; we're unable to participate." 
</P>
<P>
 For black leaders, that lack of participation is the true culprit -- not 
institutional discrimination by the African American power structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does the African American do to empower them (Latinos) when it's 
constitutionally illegal (for non-citizens to vote)?" asks Bradley. He sees his 
city caught in what he calls a virtual open-door immigration policy that is 
beyond local control. "As they continue to come, schools become crowded, (and) 
dwindling resources in cities such as Compton become more sparse. Animosity and 
friction (are) the natural product of these things, and that's what we're 
seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 census indicated that blacks made up 55% of Compton's population of 
93,500; Latinos accounted for 42%. Many believe that Latinos now represent a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 This diversity is hardly represented in City Hall, where several departments 
are almost entirely African American. Bradley and three of the four City 
Council members are black; the other is white. The mayor estimates that perhaps 
10-15% of the city work force of 600 is Latino, while up to 80% is black -- a 
fact that he and others attribute not to racism, but to low turnover among 
blacks and a longtime paucity of Latino applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged at being labeled bigots, city leaders see sinister forces behind the 
sudden public focus on the lack of Latino representation. They cite the cases 
of Huntington Park and other nearby, longtime overwhelmingly Latino cities that 
were run until recently by white minorities who seldom faced such scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black people are more vulnerable to criticism because we are held to a higher 
standard," said City Atty. Legrand Clegg. 
</P>
<P>
 However, demands for change come even from Latinos respected by Clegg and 
other black leaders, such as Gorgonio Sanchez, a longtime Compton resident who, 
as a member of the school board, is the city's only elected Latino official. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (blacks) have been in power for too long and they are in denial of the 
fact that they are no longer the majority," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Compton developed rapidly after World War II as a bedroom community. Tract 
homes built on the westside of town were open to blacks, making it one of the 
few suburbs where African Americans could own homes. The town remained strictly 
segregated: blacks clustered to the west, whites in the less densely populated 
eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1965 civil unrest in nearby Watts helped break the pattern of white 
domination. Soon fleeing in large numbers were whites, and to a lesser extent, 
Mexican Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1968, the power balance had shifted. Blacks gained control of the council 
and school board. African Americans also supplanted whites in jobs at City Hall 
and in the schools. Black leaders say this was a natural transition, as few 
whites or Latinos wanted to work in Compton, which was increasingly stigmatized 
as a high-crime, black city mired in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The city began changing again in the 1980s as the wave of immigration via the 
U.S.-Mexico border gained momentum. These new immigrants found Compton a 
convenient stop, with cheap rents and access to the then-booming Los Angeles 
job market. Signs in Spanish are proliferating along Compton streets; taquerias 
have replaced barbecue joints. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Compton's growing racial tensions might never have received national 
prominence if a resident had not videotaped black police Officer Michael 
Jackson beating 17-year-old Felipe Soltero on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Many blacks joined Latinos in condemning a Police Department that, critics 
say, too often relies on heavy-handed tactics against members of all races. 
(The killings of two Samoan brothers shot by a Compton police officer in 1991 
prompted Samoan representatives to charge police brutality.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have just as easily been a black man who was beaten like that," said 
Vicky D. Lindsey, an African American who was among those protesting recently 
outside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The police chief and other black leaders generally reacted cautiously to the 
videotape, reserving judgment on the officer's actions but downplaying 
potential racial motivations. They were enraged when Latino activists compared 
the incident to the beating that Rodney G. King suffered at the hands of white 
Los Angeles Police Department officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no outstanding history of black people beating Latinos," Bradley 
said. "Show me where one black man has burned a cross on a Latino's lawn." 
</P>
<P>
 But Latino leaders say the mayor himself has engaged in provocative hyperbole 
-- when he denounced Latinos for their lack of a public apology for 
Colonial-era Spaniards' involvement in the slave trade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among Compton's Latinos, perhaps nothing inflames passions as much the school 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 About 59% of the 29,000-pupil student body is Latino (compared to 39% black), 
yet only 5% of certified teachers are Latino (almost 72% are black). 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans occupy most administrative posts in the district, which was 
taken over by the state last year amid financial difficulties, persistently low 
test scores and widespread allegations of mismanagement. Some black leaders 
have expressed open hostility to bilingual education -- which many immigrant 
parents call a vital concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid there are children who aren't even learning to read or write 
because they don't understand English," said Concepcion Favela, a Mexican 
immigrant whose two children attend elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Espinoza, a 15-year-old student at Compton High School, bemoans what she 
calls a misguided curriculum. "I know more about Africa than I do about my own 
culture, about Mexico," said Espinoza, who participated in one of the recent 
protests outside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators say they are doing the best they can. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Harold L. Cebrun blamed state textbooks for a lack of emphasis on 
Mexican culture and expressed a desire for more Spanish-speaking staff. "I'd be 
stupid to tell you I'm happy with the number of bilingual teachers," Cebrun 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of both races have expressed fears that the present tensions could 
carry over this fall to the city's high schools, where brawls between African 
American and Latino students last year disrupted learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to head off trouble, city officials and religious leaders have 
scheduled a "unity" rally for today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to calm this down," said Father Marquis Clif, a priest at Our Lady of 
Victory Roman Catholic parish. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rally itself underlines community divisions. Representatives of the 
activist Latino coalition call the event a city-orchestrated effort to divert 
attention from Latino non-representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can have all the rallies they want, but it doesn't mean anything until 
they recognize there's a problem," said Lorraine Cervantes, a Latino coalition 
supporter. "Blacks are doing the same thing to Latinos that was done to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even amid Compton's highly charged atmosphere, there is some recognition that 
ways must be found to accommodate the city's new majority, though that could 
mean weakening hard-won African American control. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our wishing and all of our praying is not going to make these people 
(Latinos) go anyplace else," said Johnson, who has preached inclusion to his 
mostly African American congregation. "They are here, they're part of the 
community, so why not treat them like a part of the community?" Compton Profile 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the city of Compton: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ethnic background: City officials say Latinos now make up a majority of the 
population. According to the latest official figures, the city is 55% black, 
42% Latino, 1.8% Asian or Pacific Islander, 1% white, and 0.5% American Indian. 
But officials say Latinos were drastically undercounted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Full-time city employees, including police and fire (1992-93): 529. Ethnic 
background: 78.07% black, 10.78% Latino, 7.75% white, 3.21% Asian/Pacific 
Islander. 
</P>
<P>
 * Police force: 125 officers. Ethnic background: 73 blacks, 34 whites, 14 
Latinos, 4 others. 
</P>
<P>
 * Compton Unified School District: Ethnic background of students: 59% Latino, 
39% black, 2% other. 
</P>
<P>
 * Registered voters: 34,243; 17.98% voted in June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Median income: $25,699. Median value, single-family home in 1990: $108,000.

ANXIOUS MEXICANS AWAIT DAY OF THE VOTE; ELECTIONS: DESPITE GOVERNMENT VOWS TO 
KEEP BALLOTING HONEST, MANY FEAR FRAUD, EVEN UNREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the final week before today's crucial national elections, a municipal work 
crew appeared with pickaxes and sledgehammers on the steps below Mexico City's 
guardian angel, the towering bronze independence monument that is a traditional 
site of political protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers chopped the steps to rubble, threw up a plywood fence and sealed 
the angel off from the public -- and from any possible post-election unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look how clever our government is," an angry taxi driver said as he 
wheeled around the shrouded angel one day last week. "They'll do anything to 
control the people. For 65 years, they have had all the power. It's time to 
fight back. It's time for change. This year, for the first time, I'm voting 
against them." 
</P>
<P>
 The sequestered angel was a telling image on the eve of elections the 
government has promised -- and spent $2 billion trying to ensure -- will be a 
departure from the decades of authoritarian, one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
 With a civilian army of independent poll watchers, a $730-million computerized 
voter-registration system and other modernizations, the government of President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari has invested a fortune -- and Salinas' personal 
legacy -- in electoral reforms. He vows that these improvements already have 
guaranteed that the balloting for a new president and most of a 628-seat 
Congress will be Mexico's cleanest, fairest elections since his ruling party 
took power in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as tens of millions of Mexicans pour into voting booths from the Sierra 
Madre to the Gulf of Mexico, it is clear that the 45.7 million registered 
voters, and many in the government, share a skepticism as well as a fear of 
what changes today's democratic experiment may bring -- especially at a time of 
unprecedented uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the primary fear is of fraud -- the traditional manipulation by the 
ruling party or outright election-day theft that has become known here as "the 
black hand." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to see fraud; we're going to see the black hand under the table," 
said a well-educated lawyer who asked not to be identified, reflecting opinion 
polls that indicate most Mexicans doubt the elections will be free from fraud. 
"The government has promised many reforms, but at the moment of truth there 
will be ballot boxes stuffed and ballot boxes stolen, and votes will 
disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition leaders, backed by civic groups, have charged that already the 
election deck has been stacked against them. One highly detailed study of the 
largely pro-government media by the Civic Alliance watchdog group stated last 
week that during the weeks before the election, television viewers and radio 
listeners were twice as likely to see and hear Ernesto Zedillo, the 
presidential candidate of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, as 
to see or hear any of his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are widespread reports of physical intimidation. The Civic 
Alliance, an umbrella group of pro-democracy activists, announced that its 
volunteers and staff have been attacked and threatened. The opposition 
Democratic Revolutionary Party asserts that as many as 200 of its members have 
been killed nationwide in the past several years, among them three aides to 
their candidate for governor of the southern state of Chiapas in a mysterious 
traffic accident last month. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Thursday, local officials banned at the last moment a rock concert the 
Civic Alliance had scheduled at the capital's Monument of the Revolution as a 
"Music Festival for Peace and Democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fueling the suspicions are decades of pent-up frustration over corruption, 
coercion and recent economic reforms that have widened the gap between Mexico's 
handful of rich and its masses of poor, according to half a dozen scientific 
opinion polls and interviews with scores of Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The election comes against the backdrop of an economy in which 37 families 
control about half the wealth while 35 million people live in poverty, a 
reality that most voters said will drive their choices among nine political 
parties today. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a deep fear that cuts across the country's economic and political 
lines. In a year that has seen Mexico's first assassination of a presidential 
candidate in more than half a century and a guerrilla uprising in Chiapas, it 
is an anxiety that the mere perception of fraud will unleash a torrent of 
unrest -- one that some analysts speculate could lead to all-out insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 As a hedge against such a scenario, the government has gone far beyond sealing 
off the capital's angel of independence, a project that the city mayor's office 
refused to comment on despite repeated requests. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's police and army were standing by Saturday. Tens of thousands of 
additional forces have been deployed throughout Mexico City and potential 
trouble spots in the countryside. In a controversial purchase that the 
government attributes simply to "modernization," the army and security forces 
acquired about $90 million worth of sophisticated riot-control equipment in the 
months leading up to the election. And, amid the uncertainty, many Mexicans 
said they plan to return home from the polling booths and stay there until they 
are certain of a peaceful result. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very serious," said a 74-year-old woman near the capital's Plaza of 
Three Cultures, adding that she has voted in every election since World War II. 
"Before, I could be content with the election (results). But now, I'm worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants a change, but this change will be very costly." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes for fundamental change of the system that many voters believe was 
corrupted during more than six decades of monolithic rule are almost 
universally shared. That one-word theme -- "change" -- has been the single 
common thread through the months-long campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-sharing and political reform have been the clarion calls not only of the 
two leading presidential challengers but of the ruling party candidate as well. 
Zedillo, 42 and U.S.-educated, has vowed to change his party from within. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the lead from Salinas -- who handpicked Zedillo after Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, the PRI's original presidential candidate, was assassinated at a 
Tijuana campaign rally in March -- Zedillo has promised to separate the ruling 
party from the government apparatus for the first time. He says he will open 
the party's furtive selection process for future candidates and respect the 
autonomy of a new Congress that most analysts expect will have a stronger 
opposition voice than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other leading presidential candidates have promised somewhat more 
radical changes. Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the bearded, quixotic candidate 
of the center-right, pro-business National Action Party (PAN), ran with the 
slogan, "The only secure change." He vowed to dismantle the entire corrupt 
political system of government without abandoning its free-market economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a former PRI member who left the party nearly a decade 
ago to lead a new leftist political alliance, has identified himself more with 
the indigent -- pledging populist reforms to close the gap between rich and 
poor. Cardenas, now running under the banner of the Democratic Revolutionary 
Party, believes that massive fraud cheated him out of the presidency in 1988, a 
view shared by many voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The final opinion polls released before a deadline 10 days ago showed Zedillo 
with a comfortable lead over Fernandez and far ahead of Cardenas. But the polls 
are rife with contradictions, and experts suspect that fear tainted people's 
responses. The surveys that showed Zedillo well ahead also identified the key 
issues as poverty, unemployment, personal security and other matters on which 
an incumbent party is traditionally vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 The surveys, in fact, were as unprecedented and unproven in Mexico as the exit 
polls and quick, independent counts that the government will permit for the 
first time ever after the last voting sites close at 6 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 Conducted at the 94,000 polling stations nationwide, the exit polls will try 
to give a projection of the winner within hours of the close of voting. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics and opposition leaders warn that the exit polls will not be as 
independent as they may seem. One count that is likely to be showcased tonight, 
they said, has been commissioned by the nation's largest television franchise, 
the National Chamber of Television and Radio Broadcasters, which is led by the 
pro-PRI Televisa network. 
</P>
<P>
 Another quick count will be produced by the Civic Alliance, which is 
sponsoring many of the tens of thousands of Mexican poll watchers and helping 
to coordinate the nearly 1,000 foreign "visitors" the government is permitting 
to watch the voting for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The first official results will be released by the government's new, 
quasi-independent election commission, the Federal Electoral Institute, once it 
has counted at least 15% of the vote -- not likely until after midnight 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is headed by a Cabinet secretary appointed by the ruling party, 
but it includes representatives from all the opposition parties. It has said it 
hopes to have enough results by midday Monday to project the official winner. 
The institute also will conduct its count based on satellite links with key 
voting stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the government's unprecedented vote safeguards are laminated identity 
cards that include holograms, computer bar codes and thumbprints. And a Mexican 
technical institute developed an indelible ink that will be placed on voters' 
thumbs to prevent double voting. Polling station officials were selected at 
random in a double lottery, and the election commission has built several 
backup systems into its central computer to prevent the "crash" that tainted 
the last presidential elections, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final days before the vote, Mexicans interviewed randomly offered a 
wide range of contradictory opinions that reflected one of the most striking 
findings of the pre-election opinion polls: Just 10 days before the election, 
at least a quarter of all registered voters either said they were undecided or 
refused to state their preference for Mexico's next president. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower-middle-class neighborhood surrounding the Plaza of Three Cultures 
illustrated that uncertainty and the history behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 One monument on the plaza -- a vista that includes ancient Aztec ruins, a 
Spanish colonial church and mid-20th-Century apartment complexes -- marks the 
spot where, according to engravings at the site, Spanish conquistador Hernan 
Cortes' battle with the 16th-Century Aztec king led to "the painful birth of 
the mestizo people that is the Mexico of today." 
</P>
<P>
 A monument nearby commemorates another violent watershed in Mexico's history 
-- the Oct. 2, 1968, military crackdown on student demonstrators that left 
scores of protesters dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone says something is going to happen during these elections," said 
68-year-old Ana Martinez, sitting in the sunshine near the plaza last week. 
"Maybe there will be violence. Nobody knows. But we are Mexicans, and we don't 
want violence. All I want is that the PRI doesn't win. The PRI has taken 
everything and carried away the purse." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodolfo Rodriguez, a 21-year-old student at the National Autonomous University 
of Mexico and part-time handyman, stopped his bicycle to add his voice. He 
agreed with Martinez: "There is much opposition to PRI on campus, and people 
there are much more conscious of politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Both agreed they would probably vote for Cardenas. But when asked how the 
people in the rural villages might vote, Rodriguez smiled and said: "The people 
there are asleep. They are not very well-prepared. Some are like sheep. And 
there will be a lot of fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the plaza, Ricardo Repper Hernandez said he voted for 
Cardenas in 1988. But he quickly added that he was still undecided last week. 
And for 80-year-old Hernandez, that was saying something. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has voted in every election since soon after the PRI came to power 
in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man from the PAN (Fernandez) seems to be very competitive, very capable, 
and he's an exceptionally brilliant lawyer," Hernandez said. "Cardenas brings 
the glory of the past. He is the son of our greatest president, Lazaro 
Cardenas. Zedillo is young, very intelligent, but he lacks experience. But all 
three candidates are very capable, and any one of them could do a fine job." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez insisted that, even at his age, he too wants to see change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nation is waking up. The PRI has 65 years in power. It's a dictatorship," 
he said. "Therefore, this time, we think there's going to be a change. That's 
what we hope." 
</P>
<P>
 The retired furniture-store owner reflected on the question of whether the 
ruling party can, as Zedillo has insisted in scores of campaign rallies 
throughout the country, win a clean election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's like you hear a lot of us are saying these days," he said. "Better 
the evil you know than the good you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also indicated he does not expect fraud: "The reason everybody is 
interested in these elections now is because they will be credible." 
</P>
<P>
 That grass-roots bottom line would please Salinas, the architect of the reform 
package that promises so much change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are moving toward one event that has not been seen in Mexico in this 
century," the president said at one point during the heated campaign. "Never 
has the candidate who placed second recognized the victory of the one who 
placed first. I believe that this will happen in these elections for the first 
time this century." Meeting the Candidates

DEAL REACHED ON CRIME BILL; HOUSE SET TO VOTE TODAY; CONGRESS: MARATHON TALKS 
TO WIN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT YIELD CONFEREE APPROVAL ON A SCALED-BACK MEASURE. 
WEARY DEMOCRATS PREDICT FINAL TALLY WILL BE CLOSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Meeting almost around the clock, congressional negotiators said early today 
that they had reached agreement on a sharply scaled-back version of President 
Clinton's anti-crime bill that would be put to a vote in the House later today. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a sign that the legislative struggle over the troubled crime bill is 
far from over, exhausted Democratic leaders said they are not sure whether they 
have the votes to pass the legislation -- even with the support of the moderate 
Republicans with whom they had been negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be close, very close," said Majority whip Bill Richardson (D-N.M.). 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't yet have the votes," Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento) added grimly 
as he emerged from a leadership meeting shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent all day Saturday and the previous night in intensive negotiations 
with the GOP moderates on spending cuts, the Democratic leadership found itself 
struggling late Saturday night to counter a last-minute lobbying campaign by 
the National Rifle Assn., which wants to kill the bill because it contains a 
ban on the manufacture and sale of 19 assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NRA had the field today," Fazio said. The fierce, eleventh-hour lobbying 
blitz had cost Clinton's allies the votes of "a few members" who have indicated 
they may support a rival crime bill proposal drafted by Republicans and about 
40 Democrats who oppose gun control, Fazio said. Once again, he added, "the 
issue has come down to guns." 
</P>
<P>
 House members were increasingly short-tempered and full of partisan bile -- 
with Democrats and Republicans accusing each other of bad faith -- as they 
waited all day to vote on the crime bill. Some lawmakers seemed eager to vote 
on almost any crime bill so they can begin a long-delayed summer recess. 
</P>
<P>
 While Democratic strategists expressed confidence that they would have enough 
votes to prevail on a procedural motion so the bill could then be considered on 
its merits, they indicated that support was too evenly divided for them to be 
certain about the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 30 and 40 moderate Republicans, led by former Delaware Gov. Michael N. 
Castle, were expected to vote with Democrats after an agreement to slice more 
than $3 billion from the crime bill's original $33.2-billion price tag. Most of 
the cuts were to come from crime prevention programs ridiculed by the GOP 
members as "pork." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was still no formal commitment from members of the moderate group, 
which was coming under heavy pressure from GOP leaders to vote against the new 
package. The Republican leadership contended that not enough money had been cut 
from "social spending" programs such as job training, midnight basketball 
leagues and other after-school activities for violence-prone youths. 
</P>
<P>
 More troubling for Clinton's congressional allies, there were signs that the 
support of some Democrats who backed the original bill was waning as details of 
the compromise began to emerge. Liberal lawmakers, especially the 37 members of 
the Congressional Black Caucus, were upset with the steep spending reductions 
in crime prevention programs, as well as the inclusion of new, tougher language 
to expedite deportation of criminal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some conservative Democrats who supported the Administration last week 
indicated that they might switch sides to protest the fact that the leadership 
was demanding an immediate vote on a compromise crafted behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no way to legislate. . . . We can't hold an intelligent debate if we 
don't know what's in the bill and it's going to take most members weeks to 
figure out what's really in this agreement," said Rep. Austin J. Murphy 
(D-Pa.), adding that he was "thinking seriously" of switching his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked which bloc of votes he was most worried about losing, Richardson replied 
somberly: "All of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Rushing down a hallway en route to one negotiating session from another, White 
House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta was more optimistic. But he conceded that 
"heavy whipping" would be required to muster the 218 votes needed to pass the 
procedural rule and then the bill itself. 
</P>
<P>
 As what appeared to be another agonizingly close vote -- characteristic of his 
tempestuous relationship with Congress -- neared, Clinton used his weekly radio 
address to appeal for bipartisan passage of what he characterized as "the 
toughest" anti-crime legislation ever drafted by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must not let this chance pass by," Clinton said. "We must seize the 
opportunity before us to make a dramatic difference in every neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 But it took almost two days of nearly continuous negotiations to resolve 
details as the two sides haggled over provisions relating to rape prosecutions 
and early release of nonviolent drug offenders to make more room in overcrowded 
prisons for violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations began Friday and continued through the night, with 
participants finally taking a break around dawn Saturday. The talks resumed 
late Saturday morning and dragged on through the day, stretching tempers to the 
breaking point and sparking new disagreements on the bill's contents. 
</P>
<P>
 The disputes included GOP demands for procedures to expedite deportation of 
criminal immigrants, and a "truth in sentencing" proposal that would deny 
prison funding to states that fail to make repeat violent offenders serve at 
last 85% of their jail sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential snag emerged when some Democrats opposed to the assault 
weapons ban pressed for changes that would delay its implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We solve one thing and another thing comes up," complained an exasperated 
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) "It's like nailing Jell-O to the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 As Saturday wore on, the negotiators continued to predict that a compromise 
would eventually be reached -- not so much because of Clinton's appeal for 
bipartisan cooperation as because of legislative fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhaustion -- and the knowledge that control of the House and Senate next year 
could turn on the fate of the crime bill -- appeared to be the motivating force 
behind one key concession made by the Democrats to the group of Republican 
moderates led by Castle. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the formula finally adopted by the two sides, about $3.3 billion would 
be cut from the bill. Of that total, $2.5 billion would come from crime 
prevention programs and $800 million would come from funds for new prison 
construction and more police. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.5-billion cut, which would reduce funding for the crime prevention side 
of the package to about $5 billion, would be accomplished by jettisoning a 
youth job training initiative and cutting remaining "social" programs in the 
bill by about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the ratio of money spent on the crime prevention provisions favored 
by liberals would drop to $1 for every $6 spent on the law enforcement programs 
favored by conservatives in the scaled-back bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ratio did not sit well with liberal lawmakers, especially the 37 
members of the Congressional Black Caucus. But the spending concessions 
appeared to be the only way the bill could muster enough Republican support to 
get around a roadblock erected by about 50 Democrats who opposed the assault 
weapon ban -- the provision for which Clinton has fought the hardest and 
invested the most presidential prestige.

 ROAD WARRIORS: Go to the moon and back 37 times, and that's how many miles are 
racked up per day on Valley-area freeways. In all, 17.5-million miles are 
driven each day, 6.4 billion each year. . . . More than 25% of that total takes 
place on the 101 Freeway, the Valley's busiest. The 101/405 interchange in 
Sherman Oaks (above) is the nation's fourth busiest -- about 517,000 vehicles 
daily. All this and more in today's Valley Briefing (B2).

 NOT ARCADIA: Downtown Glendale will soon no longer be an idyllic home to video 
arcades, if city redevelopment officials have their way. . . . The Glendale 
Redevelopment Agency has determined that arcades are "not beneficial to the 
area," in the words of one city official. An ordinance is expected to be passed 
by year's end. (B3)

A FLAMBOYANT SCIENTIST'S LEGACY; SCHOLAR: LINUS C. PAULING'S SUPPORTERS AND 
DETRACTORS JOIN IN CALLING THE TWO-TIME NOBEL WINNER ONE OF THE MOST 
SIGNIFICANT FIGURES OF THIS CENTURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was both revered and reviled as he divided his long and productive life 
between the science of chemistry and the concerns of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Linus C. Pauling died Friday of prostate cancer at age 93 at his 
beloved home in Big Sur, he was remembered around the world with unanimity as 
one of the most imposing and significant figures of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Through seven decades, two Nobel Prizes and countless scientific and 
governmental honors, he made singular contributions to science, and his 
influence on several generations of students at three California universities 
was immeasurable. Then there were his untiring efforts on behalf of world peace 
and his colorful and controversial advocacy of the usefulness of Vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
 "He earned the respect of other scientists," said Prof. James F. Bonner, a 
retired Caltech biologist, a former Pauling student and one of his lifelong 
friends, "by being incredibly smart, incredibly inventive and mostly right. Not 
always right, but mostly." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmed H. Zewail, another longtime friend who is the Linus Pauling Professor of 
Chemical Physics at Caltech, said Saturday that Pauling had an unusual 
combination of flamboyance and scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Linus was one of those people who enjoyed being in the limelight but who also 
brought the world many new thoughts and ideas. He was just a real creative 
human being and a man of great talent," said Zewail, who brought Pauling back 
to the Caltech campus for the Nobel laureate's 85th and 90th birthday 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who was to become the only person to win two unshared Nobel Prizes 
displayed his intellectual gifts at an early age. His father, Herman Henry 
William Pauling, a Portland, Ore., pharmacist, wrote a letter to the editor of 
the Portland Oregonian in 1910, asking for a list of books that might be 
suitable for his 9-year-old son who had an "extraordinary interest and ability 
in reading." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Pauling attended Portland schools and enrolled at Oregon State 
College (now Oregon State University), graduating in 1922 with a bachelor's 
degree in chemical engineering. He transferred to Caltech and three years later 
earned a doctorate in chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1920s were a heady decade for science. Physicists were busy revealing all 
manner of new properties and workings of the atom, largely as a result of the 
then-new theory of quantum mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory, which began with the work of Max Planck and was continued, 
modified and elaborated upon by Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and many others, is 
essentially mathematical and probabilistic in character. Its central premise, 
greatly oversimplified, is that atoms and other basic particles absorb and emit 
energy in very specific amounts, called quanta.  
</P>
<P>
 Pauling was one of the first to see that the theory could also be applied in 
chemistry. He studied under Bohr in Copenhagen and became very familiar with 
the great Danish scientist's model for the structure of the hydrogen atom and 
its electron. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling returned to the United States and Caltech in 1927 as an assistant 
professor of chemistry, and was later promoted to full professor. He focused 
his brilliant, intuitive mind on questions that fascinated him and many other 
scientists of that era: the structure of molecules and the properties of the 
bonds that hold the atoms of a molecule together. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought to this work his recently acquired knowledge of quantum mechanics 
and his expertise in X-ray diffraction, a technique he had by then been using 
for several years in chemical experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 In this technique, X-rays are beamed through a crystalline form of a molecule 
under study. The X-rays are deflected whenever they strike an atom, like waves 
striking the pilings of a dock, and so form an interference pattern on special 
film recorders. By analyzing these interference patterns, Pauling and his 
colleagues were able to determine where different atoms were located within the 
structure of the overall molecule, the angles at which they were joined, and so 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 This research led Pauling to a consideration of the chemical bond itself. What 
was it that held single atoms of sodium and chlorine together as a molecule of 
salt? Or two hydrogens and an oxygen to form water? How did crystals of iron 
and other metals stick together? 
</P>
<P>
 By means of a series of careful experiments done over a period of a few years, 
Pauling, often called the "St. Paul of quantum mechanics," emerged with several 
major findings. 
</P>
<P>
 His discoveries had major, if somewhat generalized, impact on chemistry and 
chemical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences regarded Pauling's elucidation into the 
nature of the chemical bond and the structure of complex substances to be such 
a profound addition to scientific knowledge that it awarded him the 1954 Nobel 
Prize in chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1949, Pauling had attended a lecture on sickle cell anemia presented by Dr. 
William B. Castle of the Harvard University Medical School. During his talk, 
Castle mentioned that sickle cells took on their characteristic crescent shape 
only in the venous, or deoxygenated, side of the body's circulatory system. On 
the arterial, or oxygenated, side, these cells had a normal shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Something clicked in Pauling's brain and, as he had done many times before and 
after, he immediately saw the answer to the problem: Sickle cell anemia was 
caused by a genetic defect in the structure of the red blood cells' hemoglobin 
molecule. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain that he was correct in his insight -- an unshakable self-confidence 
was another hallmark of Pauling's personality -- he began a series of 
experiments that lasted from 1949 to 1952 and proved that sickling was the 
result of a faulty gene. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1950s, encouraged by his success with his insights into sickle 
cell anemia, Pauling turned his thoughts and energies to a number of other 
diseases that originated, or so he was convinced, in flawed genetic molecules. 
He became particularly interested in several mental illnesses, including 
schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Pauling wielded considerable power over his Caltech fiefdom -- he had 
become chairman of the chemistry and chemical engineering division, as well as 
director of the Gates and Crellin Laboratories of Chemistry (in 1936) -- and so 
could direct, pretty much as he pleased, the thrust of those research 
activities under his aegis. 
</P>
<P>
 He began bringing into Caltech's chemistry division a number of researchers 
with a chemical-biomedical approach to mental illness. Within a fairly short 
time, according to Bonner, Pauling had converted about one-third of the Gates 
and Crellin Laboratories' space and resources for investigating the molecular 
bases of different mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a move that was to cost Pauling dearly a few years later. Although some 
of the newcomers were good scientists who produced useful findings, many were 
regarded by the established Caltech chemists as inadequate, unproductive or 
incompetent. Tensions quickly developed between the two factions. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was exacerbated because Pauling was frequently absent from the 
chemistry laboratories and the Caltech campus during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 He was always in demand as a guest lecturer and winning the Nobel Prize only 
enhanced his desirability in the eyes of other universities and organizations; 
the invitations to speak started rolling into his office by the score. Pauling 
accepted many of them. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of this, he had begun to speak out about the hazards of nuclear weapons 
and the atmospheric tests of nuclear fission bombs. In 1958 he wrote an 
impassioned book on the threat of these weapons to world peace, titled "No More 
War!" and he spearheaded a petition campaign against atmospheric testing of 
nuclear weapons that was signed by more than 11,000 scientists from around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling presented this impressive document to the United Nations in 1958. His 
efforts were widely credited as having contributed importantly to the test ban 
treaty that the major nuclear nations signed in 1963; those efforts won him the 
1962 Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling was the second person to ever win two Nobel Prizes, but the first to 
win two by himself. Marie Curie won two Nobels, for physics in 1903 and 
chemistry in 1911; however, she shared the physics prize with two others. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his outspoken anti-war feelings, Pauling became a target of the 
stridently anti-Communist political conservatives of the Joseph McCarthy era. 
Pauling was accused of being a Communist by McCarthy and was badgered by 
"red-hunting" congressional and state Senate investigative committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling declined to answer the questions put to him by a California Senate 
committee on education, but in a Nov. 16, 1950, letter to Caltech President Lee 
A. DuBridge, he flatly declared: "I am not a Communist. I am not a member of 
the Communist Party now or at any time in the past." DuBridge made the letter 
public and avoided a head-on clash with the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1958, Pauling was in trouble on several grounds -- his absenteeism from the 
school, his continued advocacy of biomedical research in the chemical 
laboratories, and his disdain for compromise. The Caltech Board of Trustees 
demanded that he step down from the chairmanship of the division that he had 
held for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bitter blow for Pauling, who discovered that he had very little 
support above himself in the Caltech organization and not much more, if any, 
below. He remained at Caltech, holding tenure as a full professor, but when he 
could no longer endure watching his successor dismantle the mental illness 
program he had set up, he resigned in 1963 and joined the Center for the Study 
of Democratic Institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 He quickly came to regard many of his colleagues at the Santa Barbara-based 
center as "windbags," according to a friend, and left to join the faculty of UC 
San Diego in 1967 as a professor of chemistry. But there were conservatives on 
then-Gov. Ronald Reagan's Board of Regents who disliked Pauling and everything 
he stood for; they began questioning his yearly reappointment to the UC San 
Diego faculty, just as they questioned the status of professors Herbert Marcuse 
and Angela Davis, both avowed Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling refused to be baited by Reagan's regents and he quit UC San Diego in 
1969 to accept a professorial seat with Stanford University. He remained there 
until 1974, when he established the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and 
Medicine in nearby Menlo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling began taking Vitamin C on a regular, if moderate, basis in 1941 as 
part of his recovery regimen from a bout of nephritis (a kidney inflammation). 
In the 1950s, when he was greatly interested in the molecular roots of mental 
illness, he learned that two Canadian researchers had been treating 
schizophrenic patients with large doses of the vitamin and, according to 
Pauling, achieving positive results. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued by those findings, he began to build a collection of reports on the 
beneficial aspects of Vitamin C. Then, in 1966, he became acquainted with 
professor Irwin Stone, a New York City biochemist who had long been advocating 
large doses -- 3 grams a day -- of the vitamin to promote general health and 
prevent illness. Belief was soon transformed into conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling and his wife, Ava Helen, started taking that much Vitamin C every day 
and both reported that not only did they feel better as a consequence, but they 
also no longer suffered the miseries of common colds. Pauling was convinced 
that there was a causal link between his vigorous good health and his huge 
intake of Vitamin C -- he increased it to 18,000 milligrams a day in the 
mid-1970s -- and thus began promoting it for a broad range of ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although never officially recognized by the medical community for his 
research, in 1981, Pauling enjoyed one small public triumph when the National 
Cancer Institute granted his small institute $204,000 for a two-year study on 
the effectiveness of Vitamin C on cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling and his wife, whom he met during his Oregon days, enjoyed a close and 
warm relationship until her death in 1981. They had four children. 
</P>
<P>
 He was unusually successful at making money throughout his distinguished 
career. The Nobel Prizes brought him handsome sums at the times they were 
bestowed, but so did the chemistry textbooks he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling was a very compassionate individual, by all accounts, and his 
sympathies instantly sprang to those who had been made to suffer for their 
political beliefs. "He once hired a lab director," Bonner said, "whose sole 
credential for the job was the fact that he had been fired from his previous 
post for citing the 5th Amendment on his own behalf during some anti-Communist 
hearings. The man was not a good choice for the job, but still Linus stuck by 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling's greatest strength, said many who knew him through the years, was 
also his Achilles' heel: a supreme, unshakable confidence in the correctness of 
his own judgments. "When he was right, which was more often than not," said one 
longtime friend, "he was very, very right. But when he was wrong, which he also 
was from time to time, there was no way to get him to see it, or to compromise, 
or to make any kind of concession. This attitude frankly rubbed a lot of people 
the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, such foibles amount to little when compared to the achievements of 
Pauling's remarkable contributions to science and society. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had one of the most original, creative minds of any scientist in the 20th 
Century," said Norman Davidson, a longtime colleague. "There is no doubt that 
he will be the preeminent chemist of this century."

A FLAMBOYANT SCIENTIST'S LEGACY; AN INSPIRATION TO STUDENTS AS A TRAILBLAZER 
AND HUMANITARIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 They never met the man. Never even saw him. He was, after all, 70 years older 
than some of them. But young chemistry students at Caltech -- where he reached 
his greatest heights -- paused Saturday in sorrow over his passing and in 
gratitude for his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Linus C. Pauling was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaoying Rong reacted as if he had been slapped when he heard the news during 
a stroll across the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The slender, young postdoctoral researcher had first become familiar with 
Pauling's work as a student in his native China. The more Rong studied, the 
more he appreciated the significance of Pauling's contribution to chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is such a great scientist," said Rong, not quite able to talk of Pauling 
in the past tense. "He made a major impact on the progress of molecular 
chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is perhaps another side of Pauling -- not the scientist, but the 
humanitarian -- that holds a special significance for students pursuing the 
cold, hard discipline of chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a real human being," Rong said. "I admire his moral spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure as a Caltech professor, Pauling was not only awarded the 
Nobel Prize in chemistry for groundbreaking molecular research, but he also won 
the Nobel Peace Prize for his crusade against nuclear arms proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Hudson mulled over the complexity and depth of Pauling's life during a 
break from research in a Caltech chemistry lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson is a 23-year-old graduate student who did his undergraduate work at 
Purdue and says new scientists owe a great debt to Pauling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never actually met him," Hudson said. "But when you think of Caltech, you 
think of Linus Pauling." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson, a husky man with a sandy beard and glasses, learned of Pauling's death 
Friday night. He didn't like the way he found out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard it on the news," Hudson said. "It was 10 minutes of O.J. Simpson and 
five minutes of John Wayne Bobbitt and, 'Oh, by the way, Linus Pauling died.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In an office not far away, graduate student Ben Ramirez pawed through a pile 
of research material on a desk and pulled out a book he had taken from the 
library to help him on a protein project. 
</P>
<P>
 The title: "Scientific Publications of Linus Pauling." 
</P>
<P>
 The book, published in 1968, listed 375 published scientific papers by 
Pauling. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, like Rong, did not seem willing to use the past tense on Pauling. And 
although he never met him, Ramirez referred to Pauling with a certain 
affection, as he might an old friend or personal mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Linus is very keen on understanding the structure of molecules," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling was also keen on scientific responsibility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of Linus' main messages is to be careful in science," Ramirez 
said, "so that you will benefit mankind but not harm the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in his lab, Hudson agreed that fellow chemists are indebted to Pauling 
for bringing a measure of humanity to a field that is sometimes criticized as 
causing problems such as pollution and worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the sciences," he said, "chemistry gets a lot of flak." 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling mitigated that, Hudson said, but fellow scientists might tend to 
overlook such work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to go to a memorial service," he said, "that would remember him 
and talk about the things he did -- especially the humanitarian things, which 
probably more people outside science know about and fewer people inside science 
know."

DROUGHT OF INTEREST KILLS ART GARDEN; RAMONA: HEAD OF CHICAGO GASKET COMPANY IS 
CLOSING HIS OUTDOOR SCULPTURE GALLERY BECAUSE OF POOR SALES. 'IT'S THE DEATH OF 
ONE MAN'S DREAM.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He built it, and they didn't come. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen years ago Lewis Weinberg, a Chicago millionaire who made his money 
manufacturing gaskets for automobiles, was visiting a sparsely populated part 
of northern San Diego County and was seized by a vision while playing tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 In his mind's eye, he saw an outdoor sculpture garden. A spacious outdoor 
sculpture garden for artists to sell their works on consignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculptors would display their large-scale works of steel and marble and 
travertine and onyx and bronze. Art buyers could stroll through the greenery 
and appreciate the sculpture. Weinberg, as the artistic middleman, would break 
even, maybe even make a small profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Being of sufficient means, Weinberg bought some virgin acreage outside the 
hamlet of Ramona, about 50 miles northeast of San Diego. He teamed up with 
Frank Koge, master designer of Japanese gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 They cleared the mesquite brush, chased away the snakes, planted 30,000 
miniature Japanese pine trees and, using the Japanese name for pine garden, 
called it the Sho-En Outdoor Sculpture Center. 
</P>
<P>
 There was to be nothing quite like it anywhere in California: a 50-acre 
mingling of human art and natural beauty. Art would marry commerce and all 
would be happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices ranged from a few hundred dollars to $30,000 and more. The artists -- 
such as David Shapiro with his whimsical "Blowing Bubbles" and Juan and 
Patricia Navarrete with their steel pieces "Transcending Legends" and "Desert 
Forces" -- brought their wares willingly and waited for buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a few corporations, some private collectors and two cities (Palm 
Desert and Carlsbad) bought sculpture pieces to spruce up their open spaces, 
but mostly the sculptures just sat there. 
</P>
<P>
 The art-loving tourists didn't come. The big city art critics didn't come. 
Even the residents of Ramona, population 29,500, stayed away. Art is eternal, 
but artistic businesses come and go. Sho-En went. 
</P>
<P>
 One San Diego arts leader, who asked not to be identified, said: "They were 
decorative art at best, not museum quality, not very exciting to collectors. We 
should not equate the end of Sho-En with the death of culture as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the dream is dead, and Sho-En closes to the public today. Weinberg, 79, is 
looking for buyers who are interested in running a nursery or a farm or maybe 
subdividing the property for homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is buying sculpture this year," Weinberg said. "The artists are all 
starving. I could persist but it doesn't make any sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg concedes he did not do any of the market research you might expect of 
a street-savvy businessman before starting a commercial venture, even an 
artistic one. "Maybe I'm better at making gaskets," he sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona is set in a lovely valley of low-rolling hills. By all accounts it's a 
friendly town, with a low crime rate and active service clubs, and is a good 
place to raise children. 
</P>
<P>
 Even its boosters agree that Ramona is a quart shy on artistic ferment. 
Sho-En, which sponsored shows by Japanese and African artists, never really 
caught on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even think most people in Ramona even know it's here," said Julie 
Walker, publisher of the Ramona Sentinel newspaper. "It's so far off the beaten 
track, it's one of those hidden treasures." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad," said Oakland sculptor Luigi Testa, whose steel and stone "I Hear 
America Shrieking" is on sale at Sho-En for $15,000. "It's the death of one 
man's dream. But Lewis is resilient, and experience is the mother of wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
 At first Sho-En was for art buyers only. Then four years ago it welcomed the 
browsing public. School tours were arranged, lectures were given on bonsai 
arrangement and music fests were held with classical and Celtic music. Weinberg 
and his wife moved to Ramona to oversee Sho-En, although he continues to 
commute frequently to Chicago to oversee the gasket business. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing worked. "It's a fantastic idea, and maybe under a better economic 
climate or in a more receptive community, it could have worked," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a going-out-of-business sale at a furniture store, prices were slashed on 
Sho-En's sculpture in its final weeks. Works left unsold will have to be 
shipped home at the artists' expense. If they can't afford it, it may be 
junk-pile time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh well," Testa said. "Modigliani threw his stone sculptures off the bridge. 
I guess if I drop some pieces, it isn't that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg said he does not regret the Sho-En experience. He is an amateur 
sculptor himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Sho-En has caught few by surprise, given Sho-En's remoteness and 
the weak local economy. "The gallery scene in San Diego is struggling," said 
Steven L. Brezzo, director of the San Diego Museum of Art in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The market for sculpture is even more problem-laden, said Jose Tasende, whose 
Tasende Gallery in La Jolla carries works by Henry Moore and other renowned 
artists. Selling sculpture requires specialized expertise in selecting the 
right art, pricing and marketing the art, and then cultivating the appropriate 
clientele, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not an easy business." 
</P>
<P>
 Danah Fayman, a major patron of the arts in San Diego, never visited Sho-En 
but is nevertheless saddened by its demise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing we have dreamers," Fayman said of Weinberg. "Even if their 
dreams don't work out, they show us something new. Dreamers make the world a 
more fun place to live in." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg declines to say how much money his dream cost him. But he is emphatic 
when asked if he would ever launch another art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I live to be 105," he said, "no."

WARSAW SHOWDOWN PITS POLICE AGAINST GANGSTERS; EUROPE: OFFICIALS SEE THE 
FACEOFF IN HISTORIC OLD TOWN AS A HIGH-STAKES TEST OF POLAND'S RESOLVE TO TURN 
BACK ORGANIZED CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The circles beneath the eyes of Police Chief Jerzy Stanczyk are dark and 
heavy, the battle wounds of a hellish few weeks. Stanczyk is struggling for 
control of Warsaw, his underworld adversaries taunting him like a caged animal. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a month, a gang of thugs, many with lengthy criminal records and 
alleged ties to organized crime, have terrorized restaurant and store owners in 
Old Town, the capital's historic center and the cobblestoned home to its most 
popular eateries and galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 The gangsters, openly contemptuous of police, have demanded money -- in some 
cases thousands of dollars -- and reacted violently when turned away. A French 
tourist was knocked to the floor and beaten when the owner of one restaurant 
balked, and several establishments were ransacked. Anonymous bomb threats have 
also been reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a huge amount of money in Old Town," Stanczyk said from a desk 
cluttered with bleak crime reports and an overstuffed ashtray. "This could be a 
spectacular effort to gain control of it." 
</P>
<P>
 By choosing Old Town, the brazen gangsters have taken on one of Poland's most 
enduring -- and successful -- commercial centers, a crowded tourist attraction 
dating to the 17th Century. There is perhaps no better illustration of Poland's 
determined recovery from World War II than the picturesque district, which was 
painstakingly reconstructed from a heap of rubble according to 200-year-old 
paintings and sketches. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case deals with the heart of Poland," said Andrzej Cubala, spokesman for 
the Ministry of Justice. "These criminals acted in Old Town because they wanted 
to show everyone their strength and test the reaction of the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say extortion schemes are increasingly common across Eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union, where criminal organizations have found 
ways to exploit the shift from communism to private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 But until recently, Poland had been left mostly untouched. Gangs of criminals 
here dealt largely in smuggling electronic goods, narcotics, cigarettes and 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault on Old Town is seen as the boldest in a series of brash moves by 
Polish gangsters to push beyond those traditional venues. Police in the port 
city of Gdansk have set up a hot line to accommodate the growing number of 
extortion victims there, while Poland's top law enforcement official recently 
resigned in a scandal over alleged ties between criminals and police in Poznan, 
a large trade center in western Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 The stepped-up criminal activity has frightened Poles and worried government 
officials, many of whom view the Old Town faceoff as a high-stakes test of 
Poland's resolve to turn back the gangsters. Earlier this month, after 
receiving a letter from Old Town business owners, President Lech Walesa 
requested a special briefing on organized crime from the interior minister. 
Meanwhile, the governor of the Warsaw-area province asked the army to deploy 
troops in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI announced last month that it will open an office in Warsaw to help 
Polish authorities turn back Russian criminal organizations, which are said to 
be eyeing operations in Poland. The new office will be shared with the Drug 
Enforcement Administration and special services of the U.S. Treasury 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really shocked," said Magdalena Palonek, a college student visiting Old 
Town on vacation. "I didn't expect this kind of crime could happen in Poland. 
You hear about it in other countries, but when our country began changing, I 
thought we would adopt the good things from other countries, not the bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis in Old Town has taken on an even greater significance because of 
the woeful response of the Warsaw police. Restaurant owners in Old Town 
complain that it took weeks before police addressed their problems seriously, 
and then only after journalists chronicled the lackluster effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Some owners have accused officers of cooperating with the extortionists, an 
allegation denied by police, while some government officials have suggested the 
gangsters were encouraged to move into Old Town by a widespread perception of 
police incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the reputation of the police in the Communist times, police today 
are afraid of being accused of an abuse of power," said Jan Rutkiewicz, mayor 
of the central Warsaw district. "So they would often rather not act than be 
charged with doing something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants became so frustrated with police inaction that they took the 
dramatic step of closing Old Town for three days at the height of the summer 
tourism season. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the protest was announced, police inundated the area with extra 
patrols, arrested a suspect and raided the offices of a security firm said to 
have links to the extortion ring. The police presence has been heavy ever 
since, with patrol officers questioning anyone they deem suspicious, but many 
merchants fear it still will not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are frightened. We are all afraid," said the owner of the Senator 
restaurant, which opened during the protest only to host a wedding reception. 
"If we don't react, Warsaw will be taken over by the criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 businesses participated in the boycott, which transformed the 
central Old Town Market Square into a ghost town and cost merchants tens of 
thousands of dollars in lost revenue. On some streets, police patrols 
outnumbered pedestrians, but merchants said customers have since returned and 
have expressed support for the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very, very bad for the image of Poland," said Maria Bednarz, a 
hospital administrator from northern Poland vacationing in Warsaw. "Something 
had to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Stanczyk bristles at the suggestion that his officers dragged their feet 
in Old Town, saying they were only following Polish laws, which in most 
instances require a formal complaint before an investigation is launched. 
Fearing reprisals, none of the restaurant owners filed such complaints, but the 
investigation began anyway following a storm of public outrage over the 
department's timidity. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanczyk and other law enforcement officials said Polish laws will have to be 
amended to reflect the country's changing criminal reality, particularly the 
increase in economic crimes, such as extortion and fraud. Parliament is to 
review a proposed new criminal code, but reform efforts have failed in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Present laws do not allow prosecutors to offer immunity in exchange for 
testimony, and police are barred from staging sting operations. In addition, 
the country has no witness protection program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to live," one Old Town restaurant owner explained when asked why he 
kept quiet about the extortion attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Warsaw have other problems too. Because of low salaries, reduced 
pension benefits and five years of political purges, the department has had 
difficulty attracting and keeping officers, who patrol an area of 2.5 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The force now stands at 7,100 officers, nearly 3,000 fewer than allocated for 
in the budget and half the number authorized by the former Communist regime. 
About 40% of the force, moreover, has less than three years' experience, with 
most of the new recruits coming from faraway rural areas with high 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Police departments across Poland are operating with 25% fewer officers than 
five years ago, and the federal Ministry of Justice, which has been highly 
critical of Warsaw's handling of the Old Town extortion attempts, established 
its organized crime unit only in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our numbers and abilities are no match for the threats of the criminal 
world," said Stanczyk, who is also new to Warsaw, having moved here just six 
months ago from Szczecin, near the German border. "We don't have the tools we 
need to fight this crime."

QUAKE IN ALGERIA LEAVES 15,000 HOMELESS; NATIONS PROMISE AID

<P>
 About 15,000 people have been made homeless by an earthquake in northwestern 
Algeria, with the death toll up to at least 171, the government said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the first shocks hit, rescuers were still searching the rubble 
for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement by the Algerian Interior Ministry quoted by Algiers Radio put the 
number of injured at 289, of which 176 were still hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 500 homes were devastated by the quake, which hit the Mascara district 
Thursday and measured 5.6. A series of aftershocks rocked the area the same day 
and Friday.

THOUSANDS OF RWANDAN REFUGEES AT LAND'S END AS ZAIRE CLOSES BORDER; AFRICA:

 Facing a mounting refugee tide, Zaire closed its border with Rwanda on 
Saturday, sending a ripple of panic through tens of thousands of escaping 
Rwandans. 
</P>
<P>
 After 24 hours of vague warnings, the Zairian government at 2 p.m. abruptly 
halted the stream of refugees shuffling across a one-lane bridge from Rwanda 
into Bukavu. They had been crossing at the rate of about 100 a minute since the 
border was opened at its regular time of 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps two dozen refugees plunged into the dark blue current of the Rusizi 
River and swam the 40 yards to Zaire, some pulling their cattle with them. At 
least one small child was rescued from drowning. Dozens more refugees piled 
into overloaded fishing boats to make the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of Zairian soldiers threw up barriers on the rickety bridge and 
enforced the closure with whistles and brandished guns. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight sent thousands of panicked Rwandans surging against French troops 
providing security on the Rwandan side of the bridge, but the French were able 
to stop the advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour, calm was restored. The 15,000 or more refugees left behind 
merely stood on the edge of their country, some with their belongings balanced 
on their heads. They stared blankly across the river to where nearly 80,000 of 
their compatriots had already escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 A few gathered water and went about their everyday chores, but most seemed 
overcome with uncertainty. Virtually all of these people have been on the run 
for weeks, drifting from northern villages into the Rwandan border area where 
the French have maintained a "safe zone." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, two truckloads of Ethiopian troops under U.N. command arrived at 
the bridge to relieve some of the French troops, who are preparing to pull out 
of Rwanda at midnight tonight. Refugees have voiced great mistrust of the 
United Nations, and many had timed their flight to Zaire in advance of the 
French pullout. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials protested the closure of the border and expressed dismay that 
countless families were separated. Many refugees had grown accustomed to free 
movement here; they frequently sent one or two family members back into Rwanda 
for firewood, which is in short supply in Bukavu. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday, Zaire issued a statement indicating that an infusion of 
international aid into the frontier zone might persuade it to reopen the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 The government had ordered the closure to prevent another Goma, the border 
town 70 miles north of here where a million Rwandans have gathered, spreading 
disease and disorder in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the population of Bukavu has swelled 50% from the migration of 
refugees, foreshadowing another health crisis. Up to 100,000 refugees are 
massed on the city's sidewalks, traffic circles, parks and front yards. There 
are virtually no sanitation facilities; as fast as relief workers can dig 
trench latrines, periodic downpours fill them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlying space for refugee camps is already jammed. And officials said there 
is nowhere except downtown Bukavu to direct the incoming stream of Rwandans 
until at least Tuesday, when a new but distant camp is supposed to be ready for 
occupancy. But the heavy rains already threaten the dirt access road to that 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps 40,000 people have died already in camps in Goma, and the United 
Nations and many humanitarian groups here have argued that Rwandans are better 
off in their own country than as squatters in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 But that sentiment was not evident in the faces of the thousands stopped at 
the bridge over the Rusizi. Many, fearing they will be mistreated or killed 
under the new government that has taken over their country, had walked for days 
to make their escape -- only to be halted just yards from their goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more poignant was the sight of a young man who was not to be daunted by 
the sight of Zairian soldiers. From a flat bank on the Rwandan side of the 
river, the man bundled his goods in a scarf. He waded into the water, where the 
current carried him 200 yards downstream. There, on a rock, he rested. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of refugees on both sides of the border began to cheer him on. He 
plunged into the water and swam again. A soldier, waving a gun, scrambled down 
the 200-foot embankment in chase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Left! Go left!" the crowd in Rwanda shouted. The man scrambled to the left. 
With the soldier closing in, he climbed a steep rock, heaved his bundle ahead 
of him and melted into a crowd of fellow Rwandans as a thunderous cheer rose 
from both sides of the river.

ATTACK KILLS 5 YOUTHS AS BOSNIA ARMY CLOSES IN ON BREAKAWAY MUSLIM CHIEF; 
VIOLENCE: REBEL LEADER FIKRET ABDIC'S YEARLONG HOLD ON BIHAC POCKET SEEMS NEAR 
AN END. IT IS UNCLEAR WHO FIRED MORTARS THAT STRUCK SCHOOLYARD.

<P>
 Two mortar rounds struck a schoolyard in northwestern Bosnia on Saturday, 
killing five children and wounding seven, as a yearlong battle between 
government forces and a renegade Muslim businessman in the region pressed to a 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortar attack being investigated by French soldiers of the U.N. Protection 
Force occurred in the town of Skokovi, which was recently recaptured by 
government troops as they advanced on the last stronghold of rebel Muslim 
leader Fikret Abdic. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear who fired the two 120-millimeter rounds that killed the 
children, U.N. spokesman Maj. Dacre Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 He alluded to a confused and desperate situation in the northwestern region 
known as the Bihac pocket, where Abdic last September declared his own republic 
and laid siege to the rest of the government-held territory sandwiched between 
Serb-occupied regions of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the U.N. mission's headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia, were at 
work negotiating a surrender and safe evacuation of Abdic supporters as the 
attack on the schoolyard occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Government troops were within half a mile of his hilltop stronghold and 
advancing quickly, U.N. officers said. But Abdic has refused to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's academic. He's finished," Holloway said. "It's just a matter of his 
prolonging the agony." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of troops on both sides of the Muslim-versus-Muslim battle have been 
killed over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Skokovi is now in government hands, suspicion about the origin of the 
deadly mortar rounds rested on the last Abdic fighters or the Croatian Serb 
insurgents who have been supporting them from across the border. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holloway said the mortar rounds were thought to have come from the 
northwest, from an area already in government hands, adding to the uncertainty 
about the culprits' identity. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 cars full of people trying to flee Abdic territory ahead of what 
they feared would be a government onslaught crossed into Serb-held Croatia 
early Saturday, Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees here, 
Peter Kessler, said nearly 2,000 people were massed at the Bosnia-Croatia 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of fear and instability," Kessler said of the fleeing Muslims, 
some of whom had backed Abdic in return for food obtained through black-market 
connections and U.N. assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 If the government troops succeed in quelling Abdic's insurgency, they would be 
able to divert forces to the larger battle against Serbian rebels who have 
already conquered and occupied 70% of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs, spread thinly over the mass of territory they have taken, have 
lately lost ground to the strengthening government forces. They have been 
hampered by a blockade imposed by Serb-led Yugoslavia, which wants the rebels 
to sign a peace treaty that would end the fighting while allowing half of 
Bosnia to become a Serbian fiefdom. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200,000 people, mostly Muslim civilians, are dead or missing since 
Serbs rebelled against Bosnian independence in April, 1992.

NEWS ANALYSIS; BELGRADE'S FEUD WITH BOSNIA SERBS FAMILIAR TO CROATIANS; 
BALKANS: MILOSEVIC USED SAME TACK THERE TWO YEARS AGO. SOME WORRY DREAM OF 
NATIONAL UNITY IS UNRAVELING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In this rocky Dalmatian hinterland where the war for Greater Serbia began 
three summers ago, the first rebels to dare challenge the word of Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic are experiencing deja vu . 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic's faraway but high-profile power struggle with his Bosnian Serb 
proxy, Radovan Karadzic, replays a feud he choreographed with Croatian Serbs in 
early 1992, when the insurgents here refused to sign a U.N.-mediated cease-fire 
and peacekeeping plan after conquering a third of Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 That showdown ended with the ouster of Croatian Serb warlord Milan Babic and 
acceptance of the vaunted Vance Plan, which the international community 
expected would restore peace to the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet more than two years after Babic's ostensible sacking, he remains the 
political force to be dealt with here. The seized territory remains firmly in 
the hands of the rebels, who have proclaimed it the independent Republic of 
Serbian Krajina. And the prospects for peaceful re-integration of Serbs into 
Croatia appear to be practically nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 The current dust-up between Milosevic and Karadzic, which has cut the supply 
lines to Bosnian Serbs, may be a similar piece of short-run theater staged for 
the benefit of the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the split between Belgrade and Karadzic's leadership in the 
Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale is real or not, it has Serbs across the Balkans 
privately worried that their cherished goal of national unity is coming 
unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
 On what seemed the verge of victory in the war for an expanded state in which 
all Balkan Serbs would live, some of the rebels have begun to fear that 
Milosevic is willing to sell them out on the very principle their fathers, sons 
and brothers fought and died for. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of this farthest outpost in the overextended Serbian empire are 
particularly unsettled by Milosevic's cutoff of support for Bosnian Serbs on 
both material and moral grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic blockade that Milosevic has imposed on the Bosnian Serbs has also 
shut the supply line between Belgrade and Krajina, because most goods bound for 
the Croatian Serb rebels must travel through Bosnia-Herzegovina first. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more disturbing, in the view of Krajina Serbs, is the apparent 
willingness of their mentor to capitulate to a partition plan that compromises 
on the goal of unifying all Serbs. By accepting a five-nation peace plan, 
Milosevic is in effect settling for a Greater Serbia that does not include the 
Krajina. 
</P>
<P>
 Few here will give voice to their worst fears after more than three years of 
isolation, deprivation and deadly fighting. But there is a creeping realization 
among some Krajina Serbs that they may have outlived their usefulness to 
Milosevic once they fought his battles for him and seized territory that he 
apparently intends to trade away. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Serbs like 17-year-old Alexander Muzdalo, about to enter the Krajina 
army, are worried that the dream of unity they have been raised on is about to 
collapse in Serb-versus-Serb infighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could cause problems," the youth with close-cropped hair said as he 
brooded over the break between Milosevic and his Bosnian proxies. "It could 
cause a division of the Serbs and destroy what we have fought for." 
</P>
<P>
 That the Krajina leadership is worried about being left out of Greater Serbia 
is evident in its failure, for the first time since the war began, to tell its 
people what they should think. Television and radio broadcasts first sent out 
mixed signals about which faction Krajina sides with and then went virtually 
silent on the spat, apparently unable to figure out where they stood. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic has control of the media in Serbia, allowing him to cast the cutoff 
of Bosnian proxies as justified punishment of uncompromising extremists who are 
putting all Serbian war gains at risk by refusing to sign the peace plan 
proposed by the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian president has also taken control of the television service beamed 
to Serbs in Bosnia, but the message disseminated loudly and clearly by the Pale 
leadership before the broadcasts were hijacked was strong enough to sway most 
Bosnian Serbs to parrot the rejectionist views of Karadzic. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Krajina, the Belgrade-Pale standoff has generated a further split. 
</P>
<P>
 Babic, who now carries the title of Krajina foreign minister and controls the 
rogue state's assembly, last week produced a parliamentary declaration in 
support of Karadzic, while self-styled Krajina President Milan Martic 
reaffirmed his allegiance to Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 That the 250,000 Serbs living in Krajina are confused and fearful is little 
wonder, and they are finding no guidance from the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one in the RSK (Krajina) leadership is saying anything to us, because they 
themselves don't know what to think," said a Serbian secretary with close ties 
to the inner circle. "No one even wants to think about what it would mean if we 
start creating divisions among ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Babic twice scheduled interviews with visiting Western reporters earlier this 
month, then failed to show up for them, in the end sending two deputies who 
refused to discuss the inter-Serbian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The official line so far has been to maintain a policy of bravado, sometimes 
insisting the split is a clever charade for Western consumption while at other 
times claiming it would have no effect on the goal of Serbian unity even if it 
was a genuine breach. 
</P>
<P>
 "War for us is nothing. It's normal now after so long. So if we have this same 
war tomorrow, we don't care. We are not afraid of anything," insisted Mladen 
Kalapac, the Krajina government's liaison with the U.N. Protection Force. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials and Western diplomats throughout the former Yugoslav federation 
generally concur that Milosevic has so far stuck to his vow to cut off the 
intransigent Bosnian Serb rebels in hopes of engineering a change in the Pale 
leadership that would deliver a "yes" vote on the international peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The observers also tend to agree that the de facto blockade against Krajina 
Serbs should be pressuring the Knin authorities to ease their stubborn refusal 
to consider any form of re-integration into Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the demonstrable actions to bring his renegade proxies to heel fly in the 
face of Milosevic's longstanding promise to create an expanded nation in which 
all Serbs would live. 
</P>
<P>
 The pundits and analysts watching from the sidelines this time admit they are 
uncertain what the Serbian president is up to, and they concede he has a 
brilliant track record for escaping scot-free from diplomatic dead ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has bought what he is selling yet," one Zagreb-based diplomat said of 
Milosevic's apparent break with the Bosnian Serbs. "He has the problem of the 
kid who cried wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.N. civilian official here in Knin believes Milosevic is simply 
gambling that he can get some relief from sanctions before his ploy against 
Karadzic causes any permanent damage to the cause of unity or undermines his 
grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might oust Karadzic. But that doesn't mean he will give up on the Bosnian 
Serbs. Milosevic's whole political career is based on being the leader of all 
the Serbs," the official said. "The blockade is probably aimed at getting 
sanctions lifted or maybe just to buy some time." 
</P>
<P>
 The experience of Babic and the Krajina Serbs provides a telling example of 
how Milosevic in the past has successfully maneuvered to evade threatened force 
or tighter sanctions without abandoning the goal of unifying the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the streets of Knin and throughout Krajina, people are unsure what to make 
of the latest conflict. But every fighter, farmer and housewife asked to name 
the Serbs' greatest leader still recites the name of Milosevic without a 
flicker of doubt.

N. KOREA REPEATS VOW TO REFUSE INSPECTIONS OF KEY NUCLEAR SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S.-brokered deal to bring North Korea back into the international 
nuclear fold was called into question Saturday when the North rejected the 
South's demand to open all its nuclear sites to inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our unshakable will," North Korea said in a report carried by its 
official Korean Central News Agency. But, the report said, "we are willing to 
involve ourselves in clearing up 'nuclear suspicion' in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute is over two sites in Yongbyon that Western inspectors suspect are 
being used to build nuclear weapons. They say inspections of those sites are 
crucial to determine whether North Korea diverted plutonium from its nuclear 
power plants to make nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the North has refused to cooperate for the past 17 months, maintaining 
that the two sites are military installations and thus off limits to 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea has said that it will help its Communist rival build a modern 
nuclear reactor only if complete inspections ensure that the North has not 
developed any bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a U.S.-North Korea deal reached Aug. 13 in Geneva, the North agreed to 
halt the construction of its outmoded graphite reactors in exchange for 
replacement modern light-water reactors. The modern reactors are considered 
safer and produce less plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and North Korea also agreed in principle to establish 
diplomatic relations. The details of the deal still need to be ironed out. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hong Koo said the South's offer to 
build a light-water reactor and to supply surplus electricity for the North 
depended on several conditions, including full inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Washington ought to help pay for the billion-dollar reactor and 
suggested that Japan could contribute as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Seoul will urge Washington to set the preconditions in its talks with North 
Korea, Yonhap News Agency said, quoting unnamed South Korean officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The South wants the North to comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, 
which demands that nuclear sites be open for international inspection; to 
safely store 8,000 plutonium-laden spent fuel rods, and to stop building two 
old-style nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, South Korea will demand that modern reactors provided to the North be 
of South Korean design and manufacture, the officials were quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea and the United States are scheduled to resume their talks in 
Geneva on Sept. 23.

350 FEARED DEAD IN BANGLADESHI FERRY DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 350 people were feared drowned when a double-decker ferry capsized 
Saturday in choppy waters in southern Bangladesh. A desperate search by 
survivors in small boats lasted late into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The ferry was carrying 400 passengers, double its authorized load. It 
overturned and sank at the confluence of two rivers as it neared the port of 
Chandpur, 40 miles south of Dhaka, the capital, United News of Bangladesh said. 
</P>
<P>
 After officials suspended the search until dawn today, many of the 60 
survivors who swam to shore got into small boats and frantically searched for 
relatives and friends with flashlights and lanterns. 
</P>
<P>
 No bodies were found, said Mohammad Akbar Ali, Chandpur's police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship sank after it was caught in a whirlpool caused by the confluence of 
the Meghna River and the smaller Dakatia River. Both rivers were overflowing 
because of the monthlong monsoon rains.

'CARLOS THE JACKAL' REPORTEDLY ARRESTED DURING LIPOSUCTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Carlos the Jackal" was arrested while undergoing liposuction to remove fat 
from around his waist, the Observer reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The British Sunday newspaper quoted a Sudanese doctor in Cairo as saying 
Carlos had been admitted to a private hospital in Khartoum and that French 
agents seized him after he was rendered unconscious by anesthesia. Liposuction 
is a common cosmetic operation in which doctors vacuum fat out from under the 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos was arrested last week in Sudan and extradited to France to stand trial 
for attacks authorities allege he carried out during his guerrilla campaigns of 
the 1970s and '80s.

 Israeli soldiers disguised as Arabs fatally shot a Palestinian in the occupied 
West Bank on Saturday, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Palestinian photographer for Reuters was among at least eight Arabs wounded 
in the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographer Khaled Zaghari, shot in the left shoulder on his 23rd birthday, 
said undercover soldiers waded into a crowd of stone-throwers and opened fire 
with pistols at close range in the town of Ramallah, just north of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear what touched off the anti-Israeli protest, a regular feature of 
the Palestinian uprising that began in late 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaghari said he was shot while trying to take cover in a shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man who was shot with me has died now. . . . His family has taken his 
body," Zaghari said in a hospital in Ramallah, which discharged him after 
removing the bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said eight other Palestinians were wounded in the town. The 
army put the figure at seven and said it could not confirm any deaths. It 
declined immediate comment on whether undercover soldiers carried out the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Clashes with Israeli occupation troops have been less frequent in the West 
Bank since the signing last September by Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization of an accord on Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the focus of Israeli-Palestinian tensions has shifted to the Gaza 
Strip, where Muslim guerrillas opposed to the peace deal have been mounting 
attacks against Israeli troops and civilians near Jewish settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 But Palestinian residents of occupied areas outside the autonomous enclaves of 
Gaza and Jericho say they are impatient to see Israeli troops leave. 
</P>
<P>
 In a first step leading to a pullout, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres 
said after meeting PLO chairman Yasser Arafat in Gaza on Friday that Israel 
would begin implementing "early empowerment" in the West Bank next week. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the hand-over of power to the Palestinians would begin with their 
taking responsibility for education in the area Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence was also reported Saturday in the West Bank town of Hebron, where a 
Jewish settler killed about 30 Palestinians at prayer in February, Palestinian 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli soldiers last killed a Palestinian on Wednesday, when an army patrol 
shot a suspected infiltrator on the border between Palestinian-ruled Gaza and 
Egypt. Under the peace deal, Israel is responsible for security along the 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 In south Lebanon, Israeli gunners shelled a village Saturday, killing one 
civilian and wounding two, local security sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The village, Arab Salim, is on a ridge used by pro-Iranian Hezbollah 
guerrillas to launch attacks against Israeli forces occupying a strip to the 
south.

RUSSIAN LAWYER FIGHTS FOR REFORMS IN LEGAL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The lawyer has never been a popular character in Russian literature," says 
Sergei A. Pashin, a hard-working, soft-spoken legal scholar whose mission is to 
bring his profession -- and the law itself -- at least some respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Pashin, 31, leads the reform unit of President Boris N. Yeltsin's State Legal 
Agency.For two years, he has been campaigning for the "bourgeois" concepts -- 
such as presumption of innocence -- that Soviet professors taught him to 
reject. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to laws that Pashin helped draft, judges earn top government salaries 
and nominate all candidates for the bench, insulating it from political 
pressure. They may overrule police arrests as unwarranted, and do so in 
one-seventh of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 That's still a long way from the law-governed state that the reformers 
envision. Trained in the Soviet era, judges are less willing to challenge 
prosecutors, and they convict 99% of the people they try. Prisons remain a 
fiefdom of the police -- not under judicial control, where reformers want them. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to bypass judges, build confidence in the courts and educate the 
citizenry in Western-style justice, Pashin worked to restore jury trials in 
Russia last winter, more than 75 years after the Communists abolished them. 
</P>
<P>
 Juries try criminal cases in nine of Russia's 89 regions and republics. 
Somewhat more skeptical than judges, they oblige some prosecutors to prepare 
better evidence or throw out forced confessions. Juries acquit about 10% of 
defendants and convict 30% on reduced charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a revelation to some judges that you cannot put somebody on trial 
without sufficient evidence," Pashin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven other regions want juries, but many judges and politicians oppose them, 
fearing the system will encourage criminals. Although enshrined in the new 
constitution, jury trials, Pashin believes, will take at least a decade to 
institute throughout Russia. RICHARD BOUDREAUX

GORE UNDERGOES SURGERY FOR TORN ACHILLES' TENDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore underwent surgery Saturday night to repair an Achilles' 
tendon he injured playing basketball with former colleagues in the House of 
Representatives, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, 46, tore his left tendon, which runs along the back of the lower leg, 
during a game in the House gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 After being examined by a doctor at his home at the U.S. Naval Observatory, 
Gore was taken to Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, where doctors determined 
his injury would require surgery, spokeswoman Heidi Kukis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president was expected to remain in the hospital overnight for 
observation. It was not immediately known if he would require a cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Kukis said Gore was still planning to go on a trip to the Middle East that is 
scheduled to begin Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, a former member of the House and U.S. Senate, has remained active in 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "He plays basketball a lot with his friends," Kukis said. She said that after 
the injury, Gore's military aide "said he was doing fine but that it is 
painful." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Gore had planned to be out of Washington by now with his wife, 
Tipper, and their children for their summer vacation but decided to remain in 
town to help press for passage of President Clinton's initiatives on crime and 
health care reform.

<P>
 A woman on her way to work with her infant daughter in her arms was shot to 
death Saturday when she was grabbed by a man involved in a street fight and 
used as a human shield, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Diaz Roanova, 18, had just left her Washington Heights apartment in 
Upper Manhattan, carrying her 10-month-old daughter.Roanova was heading to her 
job as a flower saleswoman when one of two men in front of her apartment 
building began arguing. 
</P>
<P>
 During the fight, one man pulled out a gun, fired at the man he was arguing 
with and Roanova was caught in the cross-fire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To block the gunfire, he grabbed the woman and used her as a shield," police 
spokesman Sgt. John McCluskey said. "The infant was not harmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the argument between the two men involved drugs. The two men 
remained at large.

REPORT BLAMES POOR JUDGMENT FOR COLORADO FIREFIGHTER DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal report blames poor judgment by fire crews and their bosses for the 
deaths of 14 firefighters on Colorado's Storm King Mountain last month, it was 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregonian, citing an anonymous U.S. Forest Service administrator, said the 
report concluded that the firefighters "failed to exercise sufficient caution" 
by placing themselves in a deadly situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also found fault in judgments made by the firefighters' 
supervisors, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC News reported that investigators had placed the blame on "overzealous" 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which was started by lightning on July 2, exploded four days later, 
racing uphill and fatally trapping 12 firefighters on a down-slope fire line. 
Two other firefighters were found dead on top of a ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-four firefighters survived the inferno, bailing into a canyon on the 
other side of the ridge or deploying their fire shelters on a ridge that 
remained untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 Some families of the deceased firefighters were angered by the news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know what this is about," said Patty Tyler, the wife of Richard 
Tyler, a firefighter from Grand Junction, Colo. "It's just really hard for me 
to believe that is the gist of the report. It's too simple, to me. I don't know 
how you take a whole incident like that and wrap it up like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonny Soto of Missoula, Mont., a smoke jumper who survived the fire, said the 
report's conclusion "sounds pretty stupid to me, blaming 14 people who died for 
doing their job. If anything, they were just following orders."

BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF VOYAGES OF DESPERATION; FLIGHT: CUBAN AMERICAN PILOTS WATCH 
THE COAST GUARD CHASE RICKETY CRAFT ON THE SEA. RISKING THEIR LIVES FOR HOPE, 
REFUGEES SIGNAL FOR RESCUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the faint outline of Cuba on the horizon, a U.S. Coast Guard lifeboat 
carrying eight refugees from the island pulled away from a tiny, scarcely 
seaworthy raft. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting not 100 yards away was a Coast Guard patrol boat already teeming with 
dozens of refugees plucked from the Florida Straits earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Off to the west, in two more rafts -- a bright yellow one pulling a sail board 
and a jury-rigged craft of inner tubes and plywood -- more refugees waved their 
arms, hoping their rescue also was soon at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the direction of Cuba, a mirror flashed in the sun, glinting from the 
white-capped waves and signaling where yet another group of refugees was 
eagerly awaiting what they believed would be passage to America. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the scene 20 miles from Cuba, viewed from a four-person Piper Arrow 
plane during a three-minute period Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot of the plane, himself a Cuban American who had immigrated 15 years 
earlier, wondered aloud how the people on the lifeboat would feel when they 
learned that what they thought would be a boat offering them a safe voyage to 
the United States turned out to be a vessel headed for Guantanamo, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to feel really upset," said Juan Salas, 27, a weekend pilot who 
has helped Cuban Americans search for their relatives escaping from the island 
on similar craft in the past. "They will have no life there. They will feel 
they have gone from one jail to another." 
</P>
<P>
 A day after President Clinton announced that the refugees casting their boats 
and rafts into the treacherous seas off Cuba would no longer be accepted with 
open arms, 861 Cubans were rescued by the Coast Guard -- the highest daily 
number since the 1980 Mariel boat lift. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was obvious from the air that many more were still floating in the 
choppy seas, far out of sight of any Coast Guard vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 During an hourlong survey of a narrow stretch of water from 15 miles off Cuba 
back toward Florida, Salas and his passengers caught sight of 18 rafts and 
small boats with at least 100 refugees on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the craft had large, triangular pieces of cloth attached haphazardly 
to form awkward sails. In others, the passengers seemed to be rowing 
frantically, trying to speed their passage. In one metal rowboat, a dozen 
people were crammed together. Another was so small that the three men on board 
-- two seated and one standing -- appeared to cover the whole surface area of 
the craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the refugees flashed mirrors or reflective cloth when they spotted the 
small aircraft above. Others waved pieces of red cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the water near one of the rafts, a red flare burned, apparently an attempt 
to attract a Coast Guard cutter visible on the horizon. That cutter was busy 
pulling refugees from a flotilla of three rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That flare means that the Brothers to the Rescue were here and dropped a 
flare to help guide the Coast Guard," said Salas, referring to a group of 
private pilots who regularly fly the Florida Straits searching for refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this activity took place in a small portion of the 90 miles of 
shark-infested sea between Cuba and the United States. Flights lower than 5,000 
feet had been banned over most of the area from Key West to Cuba in an effort 
to ensure the safety of Coast Guard personnel involved in search-and-rescue 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictions angered the Cuban American pilots who patrol those waters, 
looking for their countrymen trying to escape Fidel Castro's regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so unfair," said Angel Alfonso, a pilot who flies regularly over the 
Florida Straits looking for refugees. "They're making it hard for us to do what 
we need to do -- to go and help our brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Cuban Americans said they worried that some refugees would perish 
because of the flight ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are deeply concerned for the thousands of Cubans who are now in the 
Florida Straits, as the ability of private pilots to locate the rafters at sea 
has been limited," said Tom Willie, director of World Relief for South Florida 
and a board member of the Transit Center, a way station for Cuban refugees on 
Stock Island, just off Key West.

NAVY RETIRES CARRIER SARATOGA AFTER 38 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The aircraft carrier Saratoga was decommissioned Saturday after 38 years of 
duty that included glory and tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the Empire State Building is tall, the aircraft carrier saw duty in 
the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War, the Cuban coast during the 1962 
missile crisis and the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times when I stand on the pier and look up at this grand old lady there is 
an almost lifelike sense about her," said Capt. William H. Kennedy, the 
Saratoga's final commanding officer. "Sort of a proud warrior who has come home 
to retire, knowing full well, 'We did it. Mission accomplished.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The ship was decked out in a new coat of gray paint and red, white and blue 
bunting for the ceremony, which was attended by about 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saratoga was the second carrier built after World War II and the sixth 
U.S. vessel to bear the name. More than 60,000 men served on board, said Adm. 
Jerry Boorda, chief of naval operations. 
</P>
<P>
 It launched the first strikes of the Persian Gulf War against Iraq. Saratoga 
pilots flew 2,626 long-distance combat sorties, dropping more than 4.3 million 
pounds of explosives and shooting down the first two enemy MIG-21 planes of the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, when terrorists escaped after hijacking the Achille Lauro cruise ship 
and killing an American, jets from the Saratoga forced their plane to land in 
Italy, where the hijackers were captured. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ship also knew its share of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1990, 21 crew members were killed when a ferryboat sank while 
returning them from liberty in Haifa, Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 And two years ago, crew members mistakenly fired into a Turkish ship during 
NATO exercises, killing five Turkish sailors.

RULING: WHITES FACED RACIAL BIAS AT UT LAW SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White applicants to the University of Texas Law School in 1992 were 
unconstitutionally discriminated against by an affirmative action policy that 
evaluated minorities separately, a federal judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks upheld the school's right to use affirmative 
action but said that it "does not imply that the individual rights of 
non-minorities should fall by the wayside or be ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling Friday came in a lawsuit filed by four whites who had sought 
admission to the Austin law school in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks awarded the four plaintiffs $1 each and said they were entitled to 
reapply for the 1995-96 school year without paying further fees. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials argued that the four probably would not have been admitted 
even under a constitutional process. Sparks said the four did not prove 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the admission policy, more than half of the students of each entering 
law school class were admitted based on their combined grades and law school 
exam scores. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest, minority students were compared with other minorities, whites 
with whites. Discretionary factors including race, gender, age and economic 
background came into play. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the problem," university President Robert Berdahl said. "The 
committee was looking only at the minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 The university has since changed its admission procedures, preserving 
affirmative action but dropping the committee that evaluated minority 
candidates separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Terral Smith, lawyer for the four, said the plaintiffs likely would appeal and 
seek an order admitting them to the law school.

KLAN PLANS PROTESTS AT ABORTION CLINICS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ku Klux Klansmen plan to demonstrate at abortion clinics in Pensacola within 
the next month, a spokesman for the group said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The group plans to picket against abortion and the use of federal marshals to 
guard the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really see no purpose it (using marshals) serves except to intimidate," 
said John Baumgardner, a klan member and former leader, or grand dragon, of the 
Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. No date was set for the 
Pensacola protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The klan participated in anti-abortion protests at a clinic in Melbourne, 
Fla., on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A patient attending a gynecological appointment at the Aware Woman Center for 
Choice had to pass eight hooded klan members. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Erwin, the clinic's defense coordinator, said she had sent her 
volunteer patient escorts home because abortions were not scheduled and the 
anti-abortion protesters were controlled by police.

shovels Saturday to repel a 31,500-acre wildfire that has stalked this tiny 
lumber town for four days. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 firefighters -- nearly twice Loyalton's population -- were on 
the lines battling the Cottonwood fire that has preyed upon the community since 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As on each previous day, firefighters and residents waited anxiously for the 
witching hour -- when afternoon winds kick up, fueling the blaze and igniting 
spot fires dangerously close to homes. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the winds came, but firefighters were optimistic that a 
triple-wide bulldozer line doused with fire retardant would keep the inferno at 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents on the southwestern edge of town remained on a pre-alert evacuation 
status, meaning they were advised to be ready to leave at a moment's notice if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of it. Tired of the smoke, tired of leaving, tired of the whole 
fire," resident Mary Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 No structures have been destroyed and only minor injuries have been reported 
since the fire broke out at the Cottonwood Campground south of Sierraville. 
Officials said it was started by people, but the exact cause remains under 
investigation.

SCOTT HARRIS: GOD'S CREATURES, MAYBE, BUT THEY BUG ME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ants are a common concern. You have them at your home. I have them in mine. 
And not just in the kitchen -- but on the sofa, in my car and, sometimes, in my 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleas are another problem. The new kitten, Killer, is so infested that I'm 
thinking of renaming him Victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the black flies, the swarms of so-called "buffalo gnats" that 
have tormented golfers and other early-morning visitors to Griffith Park and 
the Sepulveda Basin. The little kamikazes swarm at our faces -- in our eyes, 
our ears, our nostrils, our mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 My response has been primal. 
</P>
<P>
 I've killed them. I killed as many as I can. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, I do not consider myself a violent man, and capital punishment has 
long made me uncomfortable. But ants, fleas and flies are deserving exceptions. 
In the last few weeks, as the heat has driven the pests indoors, I have killed 
thousands, perhaps tens of thousands. In fleeting moments I've considered the 
morality of my deeds, but I haven't lost any sleep. When they invade my home or 
my backswing, Darwin's law kicks in. It's me or them. 
</P>
<P>
 The desire to kill insects is, no doubt, a deep aspect of human nature. I 
really don't think my bug blood lust has anything to do with the summer I 
interned at Field & Stream magazine. Most of us would agree that the only good 
ant is a dead ant. Ditto for fleas and flies. Oh, I'm all for the balance of 
nature and the rest of it. But the thing about these critters is that no matter 
how many you snuff out, there will always be more.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I kill them in bunches, sometimes one at a time. I've spritzed whole 
battalions of ants with Raid, slaughtering hundreds with one blow. One hot day 
last week, I went to extremes. I closed the windows, detonated a set of 
pesticide "bombs" in strategic locations and evacuated the premises. It was not 
a good day for the ant race.  
</P>
<P>
 Killer, of course, was evacuated as well. Upon re-entering the house, I 
immediately bathed him in a solution that is supposed to kill fleas. The 
ungrateful pussycat squirmed and clawed and bit and generally made me wonder if 
I shouldn't have left him indoors for the fumigation. Then he looked at me and 
meowed and made me feel guilty for such thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 Grooming Killer, I must admit, provided a certain perverse pleasure as well. I 
would locate a blood-fattened flea and trap it between my thumbnails, 
dispatching it with a satisfying pop. (Several fleas, by the way, were 
discovered holed up happily under his flea collar. Unfortunately I can't 
remember the brand, because I'd want everyone to know that it doesn't work.) 
</P>
<P>
 I must have taken on, mano a mano, or perhaps mano a pulga, about 50 fleas in 
recent weeks. Those that did not die honorably ran like cowards. But their time 
will come. 
</P>
<P>
 I've killed, I'm quite sure, even more buffalo gnats -- the little pests that 
prompted golfers to wear a mosquito-net hood on the course. You may have heard 
that these black flies, unlike the ants and fleas invading our homes, have 
propagated into immense numbers thanks to progress in cleaning reclaimed water 
that flows in the Los Angeles River. And most of us thought clean water was a 
good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 If I should find myself trying to explain my recent behavior on Judgment Day, 
I would point out that, at least in regard to the black flies, my actions were 
not premeditated. Usually it was just a reaction. I'd be standing over a short 
putt worth $2 in skins and a damn bug would buzz into my ear, and I'd slap. 
Pure reflex. Sometimes a fly would die, sometimes not. The satisfaction I felt 
in executing fleas might have stemmed from the harassment inflicted by the 
black flies. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't pleasant picking dead flies from my hair, my eyes, my nose. It was 
less pleasant spitting them out or, worse, swallowing them. Lacking a mosquito 
hood, I eventually decided to just leave my body littered with their little, 
black carcasses. Maybe they would take the hint and leave me alone. They 
didn't, but at least I can tell God that I tried to warn them. 
</P>
<P>
 I would also tell him about an incident Friday morning. We were playing at 
Woodley Golf Course, a place that two weeks ago was infested with black flies, 
albeit not as severely as the Griffith Park course. On Friday, however, the 
flies were gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Last I'd heard, authorities were planning to introduce a bacterium into the 
river to kill flies in the larval stage. Whether that was done or some angry 
golfer dumped toxic waste in the river I can't say. All I know is that, on this 
particular day, I couldn't blame my lousy score on the bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the 18th tee, however, a black fly -- a solitary survivor -- landed on my 
shirt. I thought about smashing it. These flies are slow, and it would have 
been so easy. Instead, I brushed it off and watched as it flew away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweet mercy," Shakespeare wrote, "is nobility's true badge." 
</P>
<P>
 So if it came to that, I'd tell God about that fly.  
</P>
<P>
 But I'm not really sure I did the right thing.

DISCIPLE OF DISCIPLINE; COACH BILL FITCH HAS REPUTATION AS A TOUGH REBUILDER, 
AND THAT MAY BE PUT TO TEST WITH CLIPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Fitch, the Clippers' new coach, learned discipline from his father, Doc, 
a former Marine drill instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 14 years old before I found out I wasn't in the Marine Corps, because I 
lived like a Marine," Fitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had nobody to share that razor strap with. I was an only child. There's 
many a day I would have loved to have had a brother to blame something on." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, 60, has applied the lessons of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 A stern disciplinarian who motivates through intimidation, he has become the 
NBA's fifth-winningest coach, having compiled a record of 844-878 in 21 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times I've had great players that I didn't expect to like me and 
some of them became great players because they didn't like me and I wouldn't 
let them like me," Fitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he is revered by some of his former players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Fitch saved my life," said John Lucas, coach of the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits Fitch with helping him recover from a cocaine addiction. Fitch cut 
Lucas from the Houston Rockets in 1984 because of Lucas' drug problem and 
re-signed him after Lucas had finished rehab in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wouldn't allow me to continue to play when other people wanted me to 
continue to play basketball when my drug use was up," Lucas said. "He said, 'No 
more, John. I don't care what anybody else says, I'm not going to let you play 
anymore.' 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day I'm grateful to him. He taught me more as a coach about life and 
living life on life's terms than anybody I've dealt with before. I had some of 
my best years with him and I didn't do it with points, I did it with knowledge 
of the game."  
</P>
<P>
 Although some regard Fitch's methods as archaic and maintain that the game has 
passed him by, he coached the Boston Celtics to the 1981 NBA championship and 
the Rockets to the 1986 NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very good teacher," said Celtic President Red Auerbach, who hired 
Fitch. "He's a disciplinarian. That's his big asset." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta Coach Lenny Wilkens, who played for Fitch in Cleveland, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody is more prepared than Bill Fitch," Wilkens said. "I've 
played for a lot of coaches and seen a lot of guys work, but I don't know that 
anyone prepares as much or as diligently as he does." 
</P>
<P>
 But has he changed with the times? 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years, I didn't see him change his style to really accommodate the 
change in the players in the league," said Fitch's daughter, Lisa, associate 
women's basketball coach at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 And Fitch, who rejuvenated mediocre NBA teams in Cleveland, Boston, Houston 
and New Jersey, faces what may be his biggest challenge yet, rebuilding the 
Clippers, who had the NBA's seventh-worst record last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch will be quite a contrast to easygoing Bob Weiss, who was fired with two 
years left on a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch plans to bar reporters from the first three days of training camp, which 
may feel like boot camp -- "Anybody who's in shape can go through my camps, but 
God help 'em if they're not" -- so that the players can concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fitch is a bottom-line kind of guy," Clipper captain Gary Grant said. "We 
need someone to come in and say, 'This is the way it's going to be. Period.' 
He'll do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hired by the Clippers after a 73-day search, Fitch signed a four-year contract 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the kind of credibility in turning teams around we need here," General 
Manager Elgin Baylor said. "He's a hard worker, a disciplinarian. Someone the 
players will respect." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who made the playoffs twice under former coach Larry Brown, will 
be starting over under Fitch, who has twice been named the NBA's coach of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a lot of holes to fill before the season opener Nov. 4 against the 
Portland Trail Blazers in Yokohama, Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 All-Star forward Dominique Wilkins, the Clippers' leading scorer last season, 
signed an $11-million, three-year contract with the Celtics last month and 
disgruntled guard Mark Jackson was traded to the Indiana Pacers for guard Pooh 
Richardson, forward Malik Sealy and rookie forward Eric Piatkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers could also lose free-agent guard Ron Harper, their second-leading 
scorer. They are still hoping to re-sign him, however. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clippers' bleak outlook doesn't scare Fitch, the ninth coach the club 
has had since moving here in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't scary," Fitch said. "Scary is being the first outsider coach in 
Boston. Scary is worrying if you'll live up to the Celtic family. Scary is 
being the first coach in Cleveland, losing your first 15 games and wondering if 
you'll ever win." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch thought he would never coach again after resigning under pressure from 
the New Jersey Nets after the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good ride," Fitch said. "But I thought I'd had enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fitch led the woeful Nets to their first playoff berth in five 
seasons, he openly feuded with management after guard Kenny Anderson was 
drafted over his objections. Minority owner Joe Taub responded by trying to 
replace Fitch with Jim Valvano in midseason. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Net players openly revolted against Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
 All-Star forward Derrick Coleman and guard Chris Morris refused to play in the 
final week of the season. Fitch didn't fine or suspend them because he needed 
them in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, however, that the mutiny didn't influence his decision to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have altercations and problems with players from Day 1," he said. "If you 
take 20 married couples, there isn't one of them that doesn't have (arguments), 
but they don't have all their arguments with (reporters) sitting there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same thing went on 20 years ago, but none of this used to escape. Now 
you're more approachable (because of increased media access). That didn't 
affect me." 
</P>
<P>
 He retired to his lakeside home outside Houston, content to fish and play golf 
while the Nets paid off the final two years of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch's only link to the NBA was his satellite dish. One of the first coaches 
to use videotape as a scouting tool, Fitch taped every NBA game and broke down 
the tapes as if he were still coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "The joke back home is that if you're lost at night, just look to the orange 
cast in the sky with me switching that satellite dish around and you can get 
your bearings real quick," Fitch quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who rejected several European coaching offers, realized how much he 
missed the sidelines while coaching a team of college players at an NBA 
pre-draft tournament in Phoenix last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that you can't replace is being with a group of guys in 
competition," Fitch said. "You can't replace that." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch's love of competition began on the playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Davenport, Iowa, he grew up in Cedar Rapids, where he is remembered as 
one of the best athletes the city has produced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived right across the street from an elementary school, which had a gravel 
football field," Fitch said. "We'd play football on the gravel. In my 
neighborhood, even a touch football game turned into tackle football." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch excelled in basketball and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 An all-state guard, he was recruited by Kansas basketball Coach Phog Allen, 
but decided to enlist in the Marines in 1950, after the outbreak of the Korean 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was underage when I enlisted and my dad had the good fortune to get me 
out," Fitch said. "A couple of the guys I was with, one of them came back a 
year later with fragments of shrapnel and the other guy never came back." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning home, Fitch went to tiny Coe College in Cedar Rapids, where he 
played baseball and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Theron Thomsen, former Coe basketball coach who later gave Fitch his first 
coaching job, sensed early on that Fitch would make a good coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the makings of a coach right from the start," Thomsen said. "He was a 
coach on the floor and he knew the game. He was smart and he was always trying 
to figure out a better way to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Drafted by the old St. Louis Hawks, Fitch rejected the Hawks' meager offer to 
pursue a major league baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bonus would have been a new suit," Fitch said. "The money was trivial in 
those days. Ben Kerner was the owner of St. Louis then and I remember him 
telling me that Bob Harrison, the starting guard on the Minneapolis Lakers 
championship team, only made $3,800." 
</P>
<P>
 But a two-year Army hitch stalled Fitch's baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was discharged in 1956, Fitch followed Thomsen to Creighton, where he 
was the baseball coach and an assistant basketball coach. Fitch coached Hall of 
Fame pitcher Bob Gibson in both sports at Creighton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until (Larry Bird) came along, Gibson was the toughest competitor I ever 
saw," Fitch said. "If you were flipping coins two out of three and he lost, he 
was liable to break your thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch left in 1958 to become the basketball coach at Coe, where he compiled a 
44-40 record in four seasons before he was hired by North Dakota. There he 
coached Phil Jackson, who won two NBA titles while playing for the Knicks and 
coached the Chicago Bulls to three consecutive NBA titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball was nothing when I went (to North Dakota), but they had a field 
house that was better than what we had at Creighton," Fitch said. "But it just 
sat there. It was a warming stop for the people going to hockey games. If there 
was a basketball game going on, they'd watch it and then go over to hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch tricked some recruits into coming to frigid North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd go through the grades when I was recruiting and if they had a low mark in 
geography I'd go after them," Fitch said. "I'd tell them that it was cold, but 
it was a dry cold." 
</P>
<P>
 North Dakota won a total of 24 games in his first two seasons, then the 
program took off. Fitch guided the Fighting Sioux to three consecutive 20-win 
seasons and two trips to the Division II final four before moving on to Bowling 
Green in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 After coaching Bowling Green to the 1968 Mid-American Conference title, Fitch 
was hired by the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 He had to live in Williams Gym for 10 days during his first season when his 
three daughters caught chickenpox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never had chickenpox and it went from one daughter to the next so I 
didn't go home." Fitch said. "I set up a cot in the gym and that's where I 
stayed." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who had only two losing seasons in 12 years as a college coach, didn't 
get off to a good start in the NBA as the first coach of the expansion 
Cleveland Cavaliers in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers lost their first 15 games and finished with a 15-67 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill does not like to lose -- none of us do," Lenny Wilkens said. "But I've 
never seen anyone take losing as hard as him. It was an expansion team with a 
lot of kids who didn't know their way around the block and it took time. It 
just wasn't going to happen overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 After enduring five consecutive losing seasons, Fitch was named coach of the 
year in 1976, after leading the Cavaliers to the Central Division title with a 
franchise-record 49 victories. Cleveland advanced to the Eastern Conference 
finals, losing to the Celtics in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch resigned on May 21, 1979, after the Cavaliers' first losing season since 
1973-74. Two days later, he was hired by the Celtics, who had won 27 games the 
previous season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who inherited rookie forward Larry Bird in his first season, guided the 
Celtics to a 61-21 record, the biggest turnaround in NBA history. Boston won 
the NBA title in his second season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics appeared to be on the verge of a dynasty, but Fitch couldn't 
sustain it and resigned under fire in 1983 after Boston was eliminated in the 
first round of the playoffs amid reports that the Celtics had rebelled against 
his coaching methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch maintains that he quit because owner Harry Mangurian, who had brought 
him to Boston, sold the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened was blown out of proportion," Fitch said. "There were stories 
that M.L. Carr threw a ball at me and we got into a fight. I can still remember 
the day he threw the ball. It missed me. I turned around and threw it by his 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 Mangurian concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided I was going to sell the team and he made up his mind that he was 
going to leave," Mangurian said. "We got along real well. We had a nice 
business relationship and we had a nice personal relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 K.C. Jones, who had been Fitch's assistant, succeeded him and led Boston to 
two NBA titles in his first three seasons, the Celtics thriving under Jones' 
easygoing style. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch was hired in 1983 to rebuild the Rockets, who had won only 14 games the 
previous season. After winning 29 games in Fitch's first season, Houston 
drafted center Hakeem Olajuwon and won 48 games the following season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch guided the Rockets to the Midwest Division title and a spot in the 1986 
NBA finals, where they lost to the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fitch was fired two years later when the Rockets were eliminated in the 
first round of the playoffs by the Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a better builder than I am at maintaining because I get more fun out of 
building," Fitch said. "After a while, maintaining gets boring because you're 
looking for things to do and I'm not good at looking for things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch seems perfectly suited for the Clippers' massive rebuilding project. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this is one of the best moves, (the Clippers) have made," Auerbach 
said. "They finally woke up."

NASCAR'S IRVAN INJURED IN CRASH; MOTOR RACING: DRIVER IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION 
WITH HEAD AND LUNG INJURIES AFTER HITTING THE WALL DURING PRACTICE AT THE 
MICHIGAN INTERNATIONAL SPEEDWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ernie Irvan, one of the most consistent performers in NASCAR's elite Winston 
Cup series, was in critical condition and on life support Saturday after a 
crash at Michigan International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old Irvan, a native of Salinas, Calif., hit the wall nearly 
head-on at the exit to Turn 2 on the two-mile, high-banked oval during practice 
for today's GM Goodwrench Dealers 400. Witnesses said the accident apparently 
was caused by a cut tire on the right-front of the Ford Thunderbird. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan, who had been running laps at 176 m.p.h, suffered multiple injuries, the 
most severe a fractured skull and collapsed lungs, and remained on life support 
systems at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ypsilanti. He was transported by 
helicopter to the hospital minutes after the early morning crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan joined Robert Yates Racing last September as the full-time replacement 
for Davey Allison, who was killed in July of 1993 in a helicopter accident. 
That was the second major blow of last season for NASCAR, which also lost 1992 
Winston Cup champion Alan Kulwicki in the crash of a private plane in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 season then got off to a tragic start in February at Daytona with the 
deaths of veteran Neil Bonnett and rookie Rodney Orr in separate crashes during 
practice for the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the ensuing 20 events this season, there had been no other serious 
injuries until Irvan's crash on Saturday.

 The last bad accident at Michigan International Speedway was in August of 1992 
when Clifford Allison, Davey's younger brother, was fatally injured in a crash 
during practice for a Busch Grand National race. He is the only racing fatality 
at Michigan since the track opened in October of 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Errol Erlandson, the trauma surgeon on duty at the hospital when Irvan 
arrived, described the NASCAR driver's most severe injuries during a 
midafternoon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has sustained injury to the head, including a fracture of the skull which 
has resulted . . . in swelling of the brain throughout all areas of the brain, 
including the brain stem," Erlandson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Second, his severest injuries seem to involve the lungs. Although he has very 
little evidence of external injury to the chest or chest wall, his lungs have 
been severely bruised (and) are accumulating a lot of fluid. He is requiring 
full respiratory support with a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the present time, he is being evaluated and treated by a full team, 
including a neurosurgical specialist, a pulmonary specialist. He is receiving 
minute-to-minute monitoring. . . . He is not alert at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to assess Irvan's chances of survival, Erlandson said, "He has received 
some severe injuries to two major systems, either one of which in their 
severity as assessed at this time could be fatal. In this business, I believe 
the prognosis cannot be stated. . . . We trust with minute-to-minute . . . 
support, the best outcome will occur. I cannot predict." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan was followed to the hospital by his wife, Kim, car owner Yates and crew 
chief Larry McReynolds, all of whom were at the track when the accident 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Since buying out the remaining year and a half of his contract with 
Morgan-McClure Racing for a reported $400,000 in order to move to Yates' black 
No. 28, Irvan has won five of 29 starts and has 21 top-10 finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been among the most consistent competitors this season, finishing in 
the top 10 in 15 of 20 races and in the top five 14 times. Coming into the 
weekend, Irvan trailed Winston Cup points leader Dale Earnhardt by only 27 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan has led the points for 13 of the 20 race weeks this season, most 
recently losing the lead to Earnhardt after a 17th-place finish three weeks ago 
in the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis. In that race, Irvan was battling eventual 
winner Jeff Gordon for the lead when he was slowed by a flat tire with five 
laps remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Irvan finished second to Mark Martin at Watkins Glen. On Friday, he 
qualified 19th for today's race. The Yates team was expected to withdraw. Irvan 
began his Winston Cup career with five starts for D.K. Ulrich in 1987. He 
continued driving for Ulrich the next two season, then, after three races with 
Junie Donlavey at the start of the 1990 season, joined Morgan-McClure.

JIM MURRAY: GAME IS TOO YOUNG TO DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time in this country there was a game called baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 You would have loved it.  
</P>
<P>
 Green grass, bright sunshine, hot dogs, Cracker Jack. The cares of the world 
you left at the door. "Outta the lot, Hack!" "We're wit ya, Carl, baby!" You 
were a kid again. No matter what age you were. 
</P>
<P>
 You brought the kids. It was an heirloom sport. Passed on from fathers to 
sons. Generation after generation. The baseball gene ran in families.  
</P>
<P>
 And the ballparks! You should have seen the ballparks! Lovely old Fenway Park. 
That left-field fence! The Monster! The Creature that ate pitchers. Ted 
Williams hit here.  
</P>
<P>
 You ever been to Fenway Park? A pity! Everyone should spend an afternoon at 
Fenway Park. It's a part of Americana.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Yankee Stadium. The house that Ruth built. Opera lovers had La 
Scala. Balletomanes had the Bolshoi. Playgoers had the Old Vic. We had Yankee 
Stadium. There's a monument to Babe Ruth in the outfield. "How about that!" Mel 
Allen would say.  
</P>
<P>
 The game had stars. Walter Johnson had a fastball you could only hit by 
Braille. Ruth hit more home runs himself than any team in the league some 
years. Nolan Ryan threw two no-hitters a year.  
</P>
<P>
 You loved to hear the infield chattering. "No hitter up there, Sandy! Throw 
him the deuce! Make him be a hitter, babe!" 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best afternoons of your life were spent in a ballpark. The poet 
said the time spent in a ballpark, like fishing, didn't count against your life 
span. No one could age in a ballpark. You got younger, not older. You could 
live forever in a ballpark. Someone once complained the game was too slow. Not 
for us. I never went to a ballpark in a hurry in my life. If you're in a hurry, 
go to an airport, I'd tell them.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a game that Yogi Berra -- ah, Yogi Berra! -- once said ain't over till 
it's over. Not so dumb, at that. It's a game without a clock, is what he's 
saying. A football game can be over before it's over. Not a baseball game. The 
gun doesn't go off on you. You never run out of time, just outs.  
</P>
<P>
 What happened to this happy hunting ground, this magic isle in life? Where did 
all those summers go? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it might have died in the summer of 1994. By its own hand. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could ever figure out quite why. It was the picture of health to the 
end.  
</P>
<P>
 It didn't run out of sluggers, southpaws, speed burners, shortstops. It ran 
out of love. It didn't die of old age, lack of interest, neglect. It died of a 
disease for which there is no known cure -- stubbornness.  
</P>
<P>
 They all said they weren't trying to kill baseball, they were trying to save 
it. Meanwhile, the patient died on the operating table. The tombstone should 
read, "Here Lies Baseball -- Negotiated to Death." It was an inglorious end for 
such a glorious tradition.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the victim of the oldest feud in the annals of sport -- owners vs. 
players. It doesn't matter what the issue is -- salary cap, pensions, revenue 
sharing. If the owners are for a salary cap, the players are against it. If the 
players are for revenue sharing, the owners are against it. If the owners were 
against the man-eating shark, the players would be for it.  
</P>
<P>
 It's nothing new. It's as old as the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Owners were always rich men. Ownership was a hobby. But they couldn't help 
applying business principles -- if that phrase is not an oxymoron -- to their 
hobby. They tried to make a profit. They were, after all, capitalists.  
</P>
<P>
 They managed to move the game outside the Constitution of the United States 
early on -- 1876, to be exact -- when they instituted the "reserve clause," 
which bound the services of five players to the parent club in perpetuity. 
Eventually, they expanded it to include all players. The players' resistance 
was token at first. After all, it wasn't considered a profession then. Most of 
them kept their day jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 But the players countered by trying to form a new league -- in 1890 and again 
in 1914. Both leagues went spectacularly broke.  
</P>
<P>
 The owners held unbroken sway from 1920 to the mid-1960s when the players 
brought up a can't-miss rookie.  
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Miller couldn't hit the change-up, couldn't bat .300, field .900, 
throw, catch or hit the curve, but he had what all the great ones from Cobb to 
Robinson had -- a searing resentment of the Establishment verging on hatred.  
</P>
<P>
 The game was never the same after he joined it. Baseball's were probably the 
last workers of the world to unite. Miller put together a union equivalent of 
the '27 Yankees. They never lost a strike. Or a lockout.  
</P>
<P>
 Other factors played a part -- most notably binding arbitration, which the 
owners put in themselves -- but the bare facts of the matter are that, when 
Marvin Miller undertook to organize the players, the average big league salary 
was $19,000. Today, it is $1.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The even stranger truth is, even though it cost them astronomically more money 
to run the game, the owners ended up making more.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of them anyway. A whole cannot be greater than the sum of its parts and 
baseball is no exception. Historically, whenever a part began to threaten, the 
whole had a solution: Move it. There were always bright-eyed, bushy-tailed new 
towns slavering for big league baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of them have since managed to make do with pro basketball or pro 
football franchises. And moving doesn't always prove a solution in the long 
run. The portable franchise started with Boston, which moved to Milwaukee in 
1953 after its attendance bottomed out at 281,276. The Boston Public Library 
drew more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves went to Milwaukee, where they were to draw 2,131,488 two years 
later. However, 13 years later, after new ownership had announced a move to 
Atlanta as soon as was legally possible, they bottomed out at 555,586 and 
headed southeast. And there were times in Atlanta when that franchise was put 
in the window with a "make-offer" tag on it.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a great game. It's too young to die. But those who love it were not 
consulted, the ones who collected the bubble gum cards, peeked through 
knotholes, bought the jackets, ate the Wheaties, waved the pennants, and said, 
"Say it ain't so, Joe," and introduced sons to the game. Who cared about them? 
</P>
<P>
 But what's October without a World Series? Italy without a song? Paris without 
a spring? Canada without a sunset? 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time in this country, we had World Series. You would have loved 
them. Ruth pointing. Sandy Koufax curving. Pepper Martin stealing. Kirk Gibson 
homering.  
</P>
<P>
 You shoulda been here.

DOLPHINS SEEKING SANDERS; FOOTBALL: EVEN MIAMI'S PLAYERS ARE CHIPPING IN TO 
LURE THE PRO BOWL CORNERBACK TO FLORIDA THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Styrofoam cup for donations hangs on the wall in the Miami Dolphins' locker 
room, with proceeds going toward a cure for Prime Time fever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every little bit helps! Give til it hurts!" reads a note on the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 As team management anxiously courts free agent Deion "Prime Time" Sanders, the 
cup gives players a chance to support the cause. Contributions thus far total 
25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave a nickel," cornerback Troy Vincent said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake, though -- Vincent, his teammates and coach Don Shula would 
love to have Sanders join them. The Pro Bowl cornerback will meet with Shula 
prior to attending Saturday's exhibition game against the Tampa Bay Bucs at Joe 
Robbie Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders' high-profile visit, which includes a mid-day news conference, is sure 
to upstage the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this day and age, you can't let that be a concern," Shula said. "We have 
to do all we can to put the best team we can on the field, and the players 
understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Shula, normally secretive when pursuing free agents, talked freely this week 
about his interest in Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty tough to say, 'No comment,"' Shula said. "In this situation, you 
have to acknowledge it's there." 
</P>
<P>
 If Saturday night's game seems like an afterthought for the Dolphins, it's 
something else for the Tampa Bay "Hurricanes." 
</P>
<P>
 To quarterback Craig Erickson, offensive lineman Mike Sullivan and receivers 
Horace Copeland and Lamar Thomas -- all former University of Miami stars now 
with Tampa Bay -- the game represents a sort of homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of fun to go back home and play in front of the fans," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay takes a 1-1 exhibition record into the game. Miami is 3-0 and 
seeking its first four-victory preseason since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the ex-Hurricanes are likely to see considerable action. Erickson will 
start and play into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs to play a lot," coach Sam Wyche said of the third-year pro. "He 
needs to come back after halftime and crank it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino also will play at least a half. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson has done well in limited preseason action, completing 15 of 19 passes 
for 158 yards with one touchdown and one interception. His admirers include 
Dolphins quarterbacks coach Gary Stevens, the Hurricanes' offensive coordinator 
when Erickson played for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Craig Erickson to me is going to be a great quarterback," Stevens said. "If I 
was coaching a team and didn't have a quarterback, he'd be one of the guys I'd 
want. He has it all -- a good arm, good feet, good leadership qualities and 
intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those trying to thwart Tampa Bay's passing attack is Vincent, playing 
for the first time since undergoing knee surgery last December. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past two weeks I've made a lot of progress," he said. "I'm ready to get 
back out there and give it a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent hopes to show Prime Time a couple of flashy moves.

NORTHRIDGE FACING PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge Little League team suffered its first loss Saturday: three 
hours, the price of traveling to the Eastern Daylight Time zone for the Little 
League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 After the team's 17-7 victory over Hawaii to win the Western Regional 
championship Friday night, sleep was also a casualty as the players relived the 
game until the wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The team had a 5 a.m. wake-up call, but the short night's sleep merely 
simmered down the keyed-up but tuckered-out players whose mood, in the words of 
parent Tim Cunningham, was "quietly excited." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Northridge needed more than 17 victories and four tournament 
championships to get to Williamsport. 
</P>
<P>
 It also took three flights in one day. The first left Ontario International 
Airport at 6 a.m. for Los Angeles International. The next leg took the team to 
Pittsburgh, and the last landed in Williamsport at 2:15 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge faces more obstacles before beginning series play against Brooklyn 
Center, Minn., Monday at 4 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Northridge players have battled a virus for a couple of days, 
including Nathaniel Dunlap, who will be the starting pitcher against Brooklyn 
Center. And first baseman Matt Cassel is questionable after cutting his hand at 
the barracks in San Bernardino and requiring seven stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a walking drugstore," said Debbie Dunlap, Nathaniel's mother and 
the team's scorekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest obstacle will be living down the reputation for unruliness 
built the past two years by Long Beach, the back-to-back world champion which 
represented the Western Region the past two years. Players pulled fire alarms, 
pirated golf carts and generally behaved like Little League rascals. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Jeff Burroughs, Long Beach coach and a former major league 
player, blasted officials in Williamsport and in San Bernardino in a book he 
co-authored titled, "The Little Team That Could." The book, published this 
year, chronicles Long Beach's two championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the Northridge team that they conducted themselves first class all the 
way throughout our tournament," said Carl Magee, Western Regional director. "I 
expect they'll get a clean slate (from Williamsport officials), but we did feel 
that (Burroughs) took some unnecessary shots (at Little League)." 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs' primary complaint was that Little League failed to ensure that 
players from foreign teams were the proper age. A team from the Philippines 
defeated Long Beach, 15-4, in the 1992 final, but was stripped of its title 
after an investigation that originated in the Philippines revealed players not 
only were too old but also lived hundreds of miles outside the team's 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also wrote that Little League officials were too rules-conscious about 
trivial items. Sunflower seeds and chewing gum are banned from the field, for 
instance. Burroughs didn't like the fact that coaches had to wear long pants 
and that players had to keep their shirts tucked in. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Burroughs: "Behind the scenes, the Little League World Series would 
prove to be a far different event than the Disney-ish, happy-go-lucky caper 
projected each year on our television sets." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect a similar tirade from Northridge Manager Larry Baca or coach 
George Saul. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the whole thing is going to be fantastic," said Baca, who read 
Burroughs' book during the Western Regional. "What matters is whether the kids 
will be treated well, and I'm sure they will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is trying to keep its focus on its first opponent. Brooklyn Center, 
the Central Region champion, has a standout pitcher -- Steve Kruger. The team's 
catcher is Manager Larry Wendell's daughter, Krissy Wendell. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament begins at 7 a.m. PDT Monday when Chinese Taipei plays Glace 
Bay, Canada. Springfield, Va., will face Middleboro, Mass., and Maracaibo, 
Venezuela, will face Dhahrain, Saudi Arabia, before Northridge's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge and Brooklyn Center will play under lights that were added to the 
Williamsport complex in 1992. Opening ceremonies, which follow player physicals 
today, also will take place under the lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team will play three games in pool play. The four U.S. teams each play 
one another as do the four international teams. ESPN will broadcast the 10 a.m. 
PDT pool-play games each day and ESPN2 will broadcast the 4 p.m. PDT pool-play 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 After pool play, the top two U.S. teams will play for the national 
championship Thursday at 1:30 p.m. PDT. The international championship game 
precedes the national game. Both games will be broadcast on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Series championship game is Saturday at 1 p.m. PDT and will be 
televised on ABC.

FOR CHAPMAN, IT'S A BANNER DAY; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FINDING ABLE BODIES NO 
PROBLEM AS SPORT RETURNS TO THE CAMPUS AFTER A 62-YEAR HIATUS. 
</P>

<P>
 Efriam Miranda felt left out last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 College football recruiters from USC, San Diego State and Pacific were signing 
his teammates on the Orange Coast College defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda, despite being an honorable mention All-American defensive lineman, 
was fielding offers from a couple of Division I-AA schools, Tennessee Martin 
and Morehead State in Kentucky. "And I didn't really feel like going back 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miranda remembered that, closer to home, Chapman was starting a football 
program. So he and Aaron Gutridge, another OCC player, decided to visit the new 
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first question was whether we had started at OCC," Miranda said. "And I 
was really happy to hear that they didn't have any expectations. At that time, 
they were just looking for bodies, and I was just trying to cover myself 
because I didn't have a place to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be the first to admit Chapman wasn't my first choice, but it's looking 
like a good situation now." 
</P>
<P>
 He'll know for certain soon. After 62 years without intercollegiate football, 
Chapman is taking to the football field again this week. Practice starts 
Thursday, and about 100 players are expected to turn out. It's quite a change 
from the school's last football team, which was composed of about 20 students 
at a time the institution was called California Christian College and the 
campus was in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panther program didn't win a football game in its final three seasons 
before being disbanded in 1932, a casualty of the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, Coach Ken Visser was hired away from Whittier College to start 
a different sort of tradition. His team has only three weeks to prepare for its 
opening game Sept. 17 -- at Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 The trappings of football are steadily being prepared. The goal posts and 
electronic scoreboard are place. Bleachers that will increase seating capacity 
to about 2,800 are scheduled to be set up by Friday. Yard lines have been 
painted on the field, which was refurbished last year at a cost of $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the culmination of a 2 1/2-year project, set into motion when university 
President Jim Doti announced that Chapman would resurrect football as part of a 
move to the non-scholarship NCAA Division III level. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Dave Currey, who before coming to Chapman was football coach 
at Long Beach State and Cincinnati, has since been building the program's 
foundation. After Visser came on board, the project built momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming in, Visser believed there was a need for a four-year football program 
in Orange County -- it hasn't had one since Cal State Fullerton suspended the 
sport after the 1992 season -- but even he was surprised by the number of 
athletes that called on him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, the league 
Chapman hopes to join, doesn't allow coaches to recruit off campus. Even so, 
nearly 400 potential players visited. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, many liked what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, you lose a certain percentage who decide to go somewhere else," 
Visser said. "Here, we didn't lose hardly anyone. Everybody who got admitted 
seemed to want to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Visser isn't certain exactly how many will show up for the first day of 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at the breaking point right now," he said. "If all of a sudden 20 more 
people enroll, I might have a logistics nightmare, and I will have to make some 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuts might be necessary. But Visser isn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm four deep at a particular position, I think the thing that has me 
smiling is that I'm not sure who is my best guy there. I'm happy with the 
quality of players coming in overall. It's going to be very competitive, I know 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The starting lineup will likely be heavy with community college transfers -- 
starting from scratch makes having experienced players crucial -- but Visser 
said about half the players are freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 They have come to Chapman for various reasons, such as the chance for a 
quality education without the hassles of a large student body. Most are 
receiving financial aid to help pay the school's $20,000 yearly tab. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as Miranda, Gutridge and another OCC teammate, Shad Vickers, didn't 
like their other options. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Mister Albritton of Rancho Santiago College, wanted to stay 
close to home. And others say they are excited about starting a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Griffin, an All-Foothill Conference linebacker from Citrus College in 
Glendora, wants to prove that Division I schools made a mistake by passing him 
up. Utah State had offered him a scholarship but pulled it back because he 
couldn't finish his associate degree in time to make spring practice. Chapman 
became his backup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan on starting," Griffin said. "If I don't, this is a strong program, and 
it should probably move up to Division I." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Gragnano has seen Division I; he just wants another crack at playing 
college football. A standout quarterback at Los Alamitos in the late 1980s, he 
earned a scholarship to Nebraska. But after it became clear he wasn't the 
option-type quarterback the Cornhuskers coveted, Gragnano transferred to 
Louisville in 1992. That didn't work out, either, so Gragnano gave up football 
-- for good, he thought -- and moved home. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at last season's Fountain Valley-Los Alamitos game, Gragnano heard that 
Chapman was starting a program, and after brushing off the idea of a comeback, 
he reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something I had to do," Gragnano said. "I hadn't played in a game for 
a while, and I missed it. So I wanted to give it one last shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Visser is facing a difficult task to pull together a team coming from so many 
different directions, but he isn't fazed. He said the situation at Whittier 
when he took over in 1991 was worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were 0-9 the year before, and we were down to 18 returning players," 
said Visser, who was 11-16 in three seasons and 4-5 in 1993. "You had to 
overcome the negativity of that. Here we have advantage of being an entirely 
new program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a tough challenge without knowing each other, but we've just got 
to do it. We might not have our entire defense put in or our entire offense put 
in by the first game, but we'll have enough that we can compete well."

BONDS PLEADS HARDSHIP, WINS CASE AS JUDGE PROVES TO BE FAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Bonds, who would have made $4.75 million this season if there had been 
no baseball strike, asked a judge to cut his $15,000-per-month child and 
spousal support payments in half. Bonds pleaded financial hardship because of 
the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 George Taylor, a domestic relations commissioner, granted the request -- and 
then asked for Bonds' autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds' agent, Dennis Gilbert, said in a court declaration that because of the 
strike, Bonds can't afford the $15,000 monthly payment. He said Bonds will get 
only $24,000 to $30,000 in licensing money that has been withheld by the Major 
League Baseball Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds' estranged wife, Sun, initially sought $262,000 per month for spousal 
and child support. She has since dropped her request to about $130,000 per 
month, according to records. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Stotter, lawyer for Sun Bonds, said Taylor's autograph request 
"really wiped out my client." 
</P>
<P>
 "To have the courts look upon (Bonds) as a superhero made her feel like she 
was not playing on a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor was unavailable for comment Saturday.

DOWN BUT NOT OUT; DEMOTION TO MINOR LEAGUES PROVES TO BE A BLESSING FOR DODGER 
SHORTSTOP JOSE OFFERMAN AND ANGEL RELIEVER MIKE BUTCHER DURING MAJOR LEAGUE 
STRIKE; MIKE BUTCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Butcher sat alone in his hotel room, waiting for the phone to ring, 
imploring someone to tell him it was all a mistake, that he could come home 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't belong where he was. He was a major league pitcher. He was supposed 
to be the Angels' stopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there he was in Vancouver, Canada. He was back in triple A, the minor 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a state of denial," Butcher said the other day. "I had a bitter 
attitude. I didn't want to be here and didn't think I belonged here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a hotel room because I thought maybe I'd just be down here a few days, 
but after a while, I really didn't know what they thought of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have imagined that the greatest morale boost the Angels could have 
provided was not phoning Butcher a week ago? 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, the only Vancouver player who has a major league contract, fully 
expected a call back to the big leagues last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that he earns $150,000 whether he's in the major leagues or the 
minors, it seemed financially logical that the Angels would call him up in time 
for the strike, so they wouldn't have to pay him. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened everywhere else. The Cincinnati Reds called up Rob Dibble. The 
Colorado Rockies summoned Mike Harkey. The Seattle Mariners called up Torey 
Lovullo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of prepared myself either way," Butcher said. "If I got called up, it 
was a business decision. There would have been no hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "But man, they left me down here, which shows me a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I figure it, if they didn't want me, if they really had no plans for 
me, they'd have called me up for the strike. They must have left me down for a 
reason. And I can't tell you how much I appreciate what they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Butcher concedes, it's an eerie feeling knowing he's still playing, and 
being paid, while the rest of his buddies are on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat in on all of the Major League Baseball Players Assn. meetings. He was 
present at the monthly team meetings. He cast his vote, along with the rest of 
the Angels, favoring a mid-August strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I have mixed emotions about all this," Butcher said. "It still 
feels weird, and I definitely would have preferred staying in the major leagues 
and going on strike rather than be here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through the season preparing to go on strike, but now, all of a 
sudden, it's like everyone's on strike but me. You feel kind of funny about it, 
but then you look at (Albuquerque's) Jose Offerman, and people wonder what he's 
still doing there. I mean, he's making a lot more money than me." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the strike should allow Butcher's Angel teammates to stay in 
touch with him, but there has been one problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly anyone was able to find him. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, figuring that he will be with Vancouver until the strike ends, or 
perhaps even until mid-September, when the Pacific Coast League playoffs 
conclude, moved out of his hotel the other day. He is sharing a cramped 
apartment with Garret Anderson and Eduardo Perez, and they still have no phone. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't stop Angel designated hitter Chili Davis, who telephoned the 
Vancouver clubhouse from his boat, and summoned Butcher to the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kind of rubbed it in, how everyone is on vacation but me," Butcher said. 
"I know 
</P>
<P>
 they wish they didn't go on strike, but everyone seems to be enjoying 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 It's times like these when Butcher is envious, but the cold reality is that if 
he doesn't improve during his stint at Vancouver, he may never return to the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 They still are debating what to do with him when the strike ends, and there's 
mixed opinion whether he has a future in the organization. The Angels 
desperately are seeking a closer for the 1995 season, and club officials say 
they probably will overhaul the entire bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 The only consistent performer has been 35-year-old Bob Patterson, but he is 
used almost exclusively as a left-handed setup man. The Angels have tried seven 
relievers in the stopper's role, and Joe Grahe is the only one who has produced 
more than two saves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not knocking anybody, but we just don't have anyone that really 
intimidates a team," shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. "I remember that feeling 
when we had (Bryan) Harvey. When we had the lead in the eighth inning, it was 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fear factor, something that goes along with a killer instinct, and 
it's been missing all year." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher was the one man in the Angel bullpen whom hitters feared. Butcher 
hates the tag of headhunter, but he thrived on intimidation, savoring those 
moments when batters wondered whether the next pitch was coming at their head 
or breaking over the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love standing on the mound, looking into a hitter's eyes, and seeing that 
he's uncomfortable," Butcher said. "You're giving him that crazed look. You've 
got a scared batter. And it's your game to win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
 That demeanor led the Angels to believe that Butcher could be their stopper. 
This, after all, is the man who once challenged an entire high school football 
team to a fight and once punched an opposing minor league manager in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen my son afraid of anything in my life," said Butcher's father, 
Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 So who would have believed that Butcher's greatest problem would be a lack of 
confidence? 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, who underwent arthroscopic shoulder surgery last fall, suddenly 
became passive. His arm was strong, but it was as if he was afraid to challenge 
batters. He even telephoned Alan Trammell of the Detroit Tigers after one game, 
apologizing in case Trammell thought he was intentionally trying to hit him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guarantee you, and I'm telling you right now, I'll never, ever, call up 
another hitter and say anything to him," Butcher said. "I don't need to 
apologize to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look back now, and I never was myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept thinking nobody had any confidence in me, so I lost confidence in 
myself. I didn't think I could get so down on myself, but it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 His troubles, Butcher says, can be traced to spring training, when he pitched 
only 10 1/3 innings. He desperately needed more work, as indicated by the 23 
hits he gave up and his 14.81 earned-run average, but the Angels wanted to take 
all precautions with his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 When the season opened, he simply was not ready, and with a 16.62 ERA after 
six outings, he was sent to Vancouver on April 23. He was back two weeks later, 
but all was not fine. He was demoted to mop-up reliever within 10 days after 
Marcel Lachemann was hired May 17, and on July 15 was sent back to Vancouver to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't feel I was prepared to start the season," Butcher said. "And 
in my mind, I never did get comfortable. . . . I still wish I could have thrown 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 "That hurt me an awful lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, 28, still is not pitching the way the Angels had hoped when they sent 
him to Vancouver. He is 1-1 with a 5.03 ERA, yielding 24 hits in 19 2/3 
innings, but he has 21 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's starting to get his act together now," said Gary Ruby, Vancouver's 
pitching coach. "People have to remember he's not an experienced pitcher, and 
he's still learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's gone through the whole circuit this season, and I think just now he is 
starting to believe in himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Butcher: "I can't wait for the strike to get over. I want to show 
(Lachemann) that I'm a big league pitcher. I want to show everybody I can 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm a big league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to remind myself now and again."

DOWN BUT NOT OUT; DEMOTION TO MINOR LEAGUES PROVES TO BE A BLESSING FOR DODGER 
SHORTSTOP JOSE OFFERMAN AND ANGEL RELIEVER MIKE BUTCHER DURING MAJOR LEAGUE 
STRIKE; JOSE OFFERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He evokes comparisons to Mariano Duncan, though some would argue that Jose 
Offerman is not as good an athlete. Duncan, the last established Dodger player 
to be sent to the minors, didn't re-establish himself until he was traded to 
the Cincinnati Reds midway through the 1989 season. Is that what it will take 
for Offerman? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll prepare myself for whatever will come," Offerman says of his future. 
</P>
<P>
 Since June 27, when Dodger executive Fred Claire demoted his starting 
shortstop to triple-A Albuquerque, Offerman has spent time regrouping. The 
Dukes, expecting an angry player, were surprised. Offerman says he was mad, but 
kept it inside. His sulky side, so predominate in Los Angeles, has never 
surfaced with the Dukes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expected him to be angry and very reserved and he fooled everybody," Duke 
Manager Rick Dempsey said. "He came here with every intention of getting his 
game back." 
</P>
<P>
 After being the starting Dodger shortstop for two full seasons, Offerman still 
doesn't think his demotion was altogether fair. Speaking before a game Saturday 
against the Las Vegas Stars, Offerman said the reason the Dodgers gave for 
sending him down -- his poor hitting -- troubled him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard, especially for the reason they said they sent me down," Offerman 
said with no trace of anger in his voice. "It's like they didn't give me a 
chance through the first half (of the season). For the time I've been playing 
as a regular, it's unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . I've been mad, but the only way I can get over it is to try and play 
my game. I keep it inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman's offense has improved -- he is batting .337 with 21 runs batted in 
and eight stolen bases over 44 games, including three doubles and four triples. 
Dempsey says Offerman's concentration in the field also has improved, although 
he has made 11 errors, most of them on routine plays. But along with the mental 
lapses, Dempsey says there have also been some exceptional plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The errors are misleading -- he has made some outstanding defensive plays 
here and has done a great job for me," Dempsey said. "He has made some stupid 
errors like taking too much time and letting a ball slip out of his hands. But 
he has made some great plays, such as up the middle and catching balls behind 
second base and throwing guys out . . . and he has made outstanding plays to 
his right -- it's the routine plays that give him more trouble. The easy ones 
are where he is going to mess up." 
</P>
<P>
 Only once did Dempsey discuss defense with Offerman, and very little has been 
said by Dempsey's coaches. "I saw him fielding the ball one time standing up 
straight and I said to him, 'You are going to make a lot more errors that way, 
that's not how this organization taught you how to field.' Jose's work ethic 
has changed. Before he never expected he would have to work so hard to keep his 
tools in shape. But now at age 25, though that isn't old, he realizes he has to 
work at it." 
</P>
<P>
 There's been enough improvement for Claire to say that Offerman is still in 
the Dodgers' plans and will be back with the club in September if the strike is 
over. But then what?  
</P>
<P>
 "The manager will fill out the lineup card just like he always does," Claire 
said, passing the decision on to Tom Lasorda.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Offerman: "I don't know what will happen if I go back to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Rafael Bournigal has solidified the defense in Offerman's place, but 
it is clear that the Dodgers do not see him there in the long term. Although 
Bournigal has had some clutch hits, he cannot be counted on offensively. With 
no backup shortstop on the bench, second baseman Delino DeShields must move to 
short, a position he is very uncomfortable with, when Bournigal leaves the game 
for a pinch-hitter. That puts Jeff Treadway at second base, and the defense 
suffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Delino plays shortstop we have two players who are not in their 
customary positions," Claire said. "Are we stronger or weaker there 
defensively? I could not say we are stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been suspicions that Claire might try to trade Offerman, the only 
Dodger with a major league contract who is still getting paid. Offerman signed 
a two-year, $2.115-million deal in the spring, earning $515,000 this season and 
$1.6 million next season, and acknowledged that it is nice to be getting 
paychecks.  
</P>
<P>
 But Claire says he doesn't want Offerman to go elsewhere, a move that helped 
Duncan, who this season was voted the starting All-Star second baseman in the 
National League. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would have to draw some comparison between the two (Offerman and Duncan), 
you can't help not to," Claire said. "These are two young players who are very 
talented with adjustments they have had to make to the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . I hope that Jose can do it with us. I would hate to think he would 
have to go somewhere else to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 To Claire, attitude is extremely important, and Offerman's calm and 
hard-working demeanor while in Albuquerque should not be underestimated when it 
comes to giving him another chance. It is a major switch for a player who has 
sulked for most of two seasons after being criticized by the fans, media and 
privately by teammates for his defensive lapses. But through it all, Offerman 
always had his bat, until this season.  
</P>
<P>
 His frustration at the plate escalated to a high point when he lost his temper 
at Lasorda in front of a national television audience after Lasorda asked him 
to sacrifice with the pitcher on deck. That incident brought him under 
disciplinary action by the club, and he was subsequently benched for three 
games for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Offerman voiced regret about the incident, maybe it would have been 
different. But a week later he was still wondering why Lasorda had benched him. 
Lasorda merely pointed to a sub-.200 batting average. Though Claire says the 
incident had nothing to do with the demotion, Offerman's tantrum helped write 
his ticket down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great idea to allow Jose to step back and then charge back to the 
majors," Dempsey said. "Wherever he plays from this point, whether it is for 
the Dodgers or whoever, he realizes he will have to be a different person than 
he was." 
</P>
<P>
 The tantrum came at a time when Lasorda was telling Offerman to hit down on 
the ball, much the same way he used to try and pound the philosophy into 
Duncan. It was also Duncan who publicly voiced his displeasure with Lasorda 
when he did not make the team after spring training in 1988. He had been the 
Dodgers' opening-day second baseman in 1985, taking over for an injured Steve 
Sax, then moved to shortstop in June and started the rest of the season, 
including the playoffs against the St. Louis Cardinals.  
</P>
<P>
 The next season though, Duncan struggled, was injured and lost his starting 
job. Midway through '87 he was demoted to Albuquerque for about 10 days, but it 
was in the spring of 1988 that he sealed his fate with the Dodgers. When he 
didn't make the team, Duncan lashed out publicly at Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
 But Offerman did things differently. Instead of voicing his feelings, he 
arrived in Albuquerque ready to work.  
</P>
<P>
 "The way they respond means a lot when players get sent down," Claire said. 
"It's like getting knocked down. The issue is, do you get back up?" 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview about two weeks before he was sent down, Offerman, talking 
about the criticism and other pitfalls he had experienced with the Dodgers, 
said he didn't believe there was anything left for him to go through in Los 
Angeles. "I don't know that anything that happens is going to affect me 
anymore," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, when reminded of that statement, he said that it was still true. 
"I'm just trying to take care of what I need to do," he said. "I'm doing my 
best."

MIKE DOWNEY: THINKING THE WORLD OF LITTLE LEAGUERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because it is so uncool, I make it a rule never to say congratulations to 
anyone for anything. No cheering. I never write: "The Dodgers made it to the 
World Series today by defeating the Giants. Way to go, dudes!" 
</P>
<P>
 But because I happen to be a San Fernando Valley boy, I am breaking that rule 
today. I want to add my congratulations to some young guys, my guys, the Quake 
Kids, who have done the community of Northridge proud by qualifying for the 
Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., which could be the only World 
Series we see all year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, an earthquake put the town on the national map in a way it really 
regretted. How neat it would be to post new signposts at the city limits -- 
Home of the Little League World Champions -- and become the epicenter of 
baseball. Have your quake and eat it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach kicked some Little League butt the last couple of years, and now 
Northridge gets its chance. 
</P>
<P>
 They play in this league for low wages -- pizza. So wouldn't it be nice to see 
three or four of the Dodgers get together and discuss traveling to Williamsport 
to root for these players, as a demonstration of support for some kids who have 
long rooted for them? Make a nice gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 I also have some good advice to give the Northridge team, which defeated one 
from Hawaii, 17-7, in a regional final Friday night at San Bernardino. Since 
this was virtually the only game in town, local newspapers and television 
covered it with everything but reverse-angle replays and Tim McCarver. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are three things you Northridge guys should remember: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- You have already won. Try hard, don't get too down if you lose, don't rub 
it in if you win, don't throw Gatorade on the coach unless it's really cold. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- If you lose to the Philippines, don't forget, ask to see the birth 
certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Don't charge for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and you might like to pick up a copy of a very fine book, "The Little Team 
That Could," to read on the plane. It was written by Jeff Burroughs, the former 
big league slugger and American League MVP who helped coach Long Beach's team 
to two Little League World Series championships. 
</P>
<P>
 This book tells you everything you ever wanted to know about Williamsport 
except where's Waldo. 
</P>
<P>
 It tells you about Jeff's son, Sean, who was one of the big stars of the team, 
and I do mean big. Sean ended up sitting with David Letterman on national TV. 
He looked as comfortable in that chair as Teri Garr. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean wasn't exactly shy. On Page 229, his father tells of how a reporter asked 
Sean what he wanted to be when he grew up. Even at my age, I am too embarrassed 
to print Sean's answer. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was Jeremy Hess, who was the last guy to get off the bench at 
Williamsport when he ripped one to the wall in right-center and won the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The players usually stay confined to a compound, but one night Jeremy and his 
family went to a restaurant, where they ran into Jeff Burroughs. When the coach 
returned to the compound, he saw police cars and cops and panicky parents. One 
of the Long Beach boys was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who?" Burroughs asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeremy Hess," was the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 A very relieved coach was able to reassure everyone that he knew exactly where 
Jeremy was. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose my favorite anecdote in Burroughs' book has to do with a 
sportswriter. Dave Cunningham of the Long Beach Press-Telegram had long been 
covering and accompanying the team. On the plane trip home, the coaches got to 
sit in first class. Cunningham sat in back with kids who pelted each other with 
peanuts and pillows. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then he did something he had never done in 22 years as a sportswriter," 
Burroughs wrote. "He told a group of athletes to sit down and shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 I had a great time watching TV interviews Friday night after the Northridge 
game, after Peter Tuber and Matt Cunningham and Nathaniel Dunlap and Matt 
Fisher and Justin Gentile and David Teraoka and Michael Frost and everybody 
else did such a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 Have a great trip, guys. I promise never to tell you to shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, one more thing. For you Northridge parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Long Beach people drew up a big banner last year, with "Long Beach 
Can't Be Stopped" on it. The letters "CBS" were written extra-large, so the TV 
cameras could catch it. Which was cool, except for one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was on ESPN.

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; FOR NICK PRICE, WINNING WAYS BEGAN WITH LOSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The beginning of the beginning for Nick Price was the end of a tournament that 
he lost six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it wasn't just any tournament. It was the 1988 British Open, when 
Price was edged by Seve Ballesteros in the closing round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew then my long game was not (enough) to get me to win major 
championships," said Price, whose closing-round 69 at Royal Lytham in England 
didn't match up to Ballesteros' 65. "If I had to look at that championship in 
'88, it was only my short game that stopped me from winning because if my short 
game had been as strong as his, I may have beaten him that day." 
</P>
<P>
 Price said that was the turning point in his career, the event that prompted 
him to work on his short game. According to the British Open champion and now 
two-time PGA champion, it is the secret to his success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it seems like, week in and week out, it's what keeps me going," he said. 
"My swing is much the same as it has been for the last two or three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is Price the best player in golf right now, he also may be one of the 
nicest. Certainly he is among the writers' favorites. Last year, Dave 
Hackenberg of the Toledo Blade needed to interview Price, whom he had never 
met, because Price soon was to play the PGA Championship at Inverness in Toledo 
as the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Price asked how much time he needed and Hackenberg said he was sorry, but he 
really needed 30 minutes or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought for a minute and said 'Do you have any dinner plans?' " Hackenberg 
said. "He took me to dinner, we talked for two hours and he wouldn't even let 
me pick up the check." 
</P>
<P>
 The way Price is playing now, he could afford to take a whole bunch of people 
to dinner. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A new Cup: For all you Ryder Cup fans out there, here's something along the 
same lines. It's the Presidents Cup, a Ryder Cup-inspired team competition 
between 12 players from the United States and 12 players from everywhere else, 
except Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Presidents Cup will be played Sept. 16-18 at Robert Trent Jones Golf 
Club in Gainesville, Va., then will be played every other year, alternating 
with the Ryder Cup. The Presidents Cup is the brainchild of the PGA Tour, 
whereas the Ryder Cup is under the control of the PGA of America and has been 
in business since 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the PGA of America and the PGA Tour hope there is no conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been assured by players and the PGA Tour office that they'd never do 
anything to harm the Ryder Cup," said Jim Awtrey, chief executive officer of 
the PGA of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanny Wadkins, the Ryder Cup captain, said he doesn't think the Presidents Cup 
will hurt the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ryder Cup is too strong an entity," Wadkins said. "For me, it probably 
offers a chance to watch guys like Loren Roberts and Jeff Maggert and Tom 
Lehman play in that type of competition this year because these are guys that 
will probably make my next Ryder Cup team." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale Irwin is the U.S. captain and David Graham of Australia is the 
international team captain for the Presidents Cup. Both will be eligible to 
play, and Irwin is considered likely to grab his clubs. For that reason, Paul 
Azinger was named Friday as a co-captain. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team will be selected from how the players stand on the money list as 
of next Sunday. The international team's eligibility is based on the Sony 
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 The current top 12 for the U.S. are Maggert, Corey Pavin, Lehman, Roberts, 
John Huston, Jim Gallagher Jr., Irwin, Davis Love III, Fred Couples, Jay Haas, 
Tom Kite and David Edwards. The current top 12 eligible for the international 
team are Price (Zimbabwe), Greg Norman (Australia), Ernie Els (South Africa), 
David Frost (South Africa), Jumbo Ozaki (Japan), Mark McNulty (Zimbabwe), Vijay 
Singh (Fiji), Frank Nobilo (New Zealand), Tommy Nakajima (Japan), Steve 
Elkington (Australia), Peter Senior (Australia) and Craig Parry (Australia). 
</P>
<P>
 Els said last week he would not play and neither Ozaki and Nakajima is 
expected to play. The next three eligible are Robert Allenby (Australia), Tony 
Johnstone (Zimbabwe) and Rodger Davis (Australia). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner than you think: Price's name barely has been inscribed on the Wanamaker 
Trophy, but preparations for the 77th PGA Championship at Riviera are well 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket sales were begun at a press conference at Riviera and telephones were 
continually busy when ticket information was given on the CBS telecast of the 
PGA last weekend from Southern Hills in Tulsa. Part of the reason for the 
ticket success is a clever phone number: (800) PGA IN 95. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 volunteers are being sought and those interested will be 
volunteering more than their time. There is a $140 volunteer fee. The event is 
projected to generate an economic impact of $40 million or more. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Snow job: Who says no one has an idea how to slow down Nick Price? 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Mickelson, who finished third to Price in the PGA Championship, has a 
plan: "I'm going to do my best to take him skiing next winter." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson broke bones in both legs in a skiing accident in March.

 And Rocko Mediate: From The Good Doctor's column in Inside Sports: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Who are the favorites at the Fred Flintstone Memorial Golf Classic 
at Pebble Beach? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I'm picking Quarry Pavin, Jack Bricklaus, Greg Oreman, David Pebbles, 
Fred Rubbles, Shale Irwin, Fuzzy Boulder, Bren Crenstone and Chi Chi 
Rockriguez.

 Flying Kite: In case you missed it, the $22,500 Tom Kite earned for tying for 
11th place at the Buick Open two weeks ago means he is the first player in PGA 
Tour history to earn $9 million. Golf Notes

<P>
 The South golf course at Coto de Caza, designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr., is 
on schedule and is expected to open next spring. . . . The 17th Dr. Mayme 
Clayton Classic will be held Sept. 10 at the Chester Washington course. The 
event benefits the Western States Black Research and Educational Center. 
Details: (213) 737-3292.

<P>
 The Exchange Club of Culver City is conducting a tournament to benefit the 
National Kidney Foundation of Southern California on Sept. 12 at Wilshire 
Country Club. Details: (310) 641-8152. . . . The American Cancer Society's 
Women's golf classic will be held Oct. 24 at SeaCliff Country Club in 
Huntington Beach. Proceeds will go to breast cancer research, programs and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The PGA of America selected the Country Club in Brookline, Mass., as the site 
of the 1999 Ryder Cup matches. The Country Club's 7,010-yard, par-71 course has 
been the venue for three U.S. Opens, most recently in 1988 when Curtis Strange 
defeated Nick Faldo in an 18-hole playoff. Ryder Cup matches between 12 
professionals from the United States and 12 from Europe are held every two 
years on alternate sides of the Atlantic.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; INTENSITY ABSENT IN LAX SCRIMMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighty plays were scheduled Saturday, with full contact and officials -- 
everything UCLA needed to get an idea of how ready it is to play Tennessee in 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is: not all that ready, because the 80 were marked down to 77 -- or 
16, depending on who is counting. The first 61 plays did not finish in a 
tackle, the better to keep Bruins free of injury. The other 16 were run with 
third- or fourth-stringers. And the scrimmage was run without the first-, 
second- and third-string tailbacks: in order, Sharmon Shah, Derek Ayers and 
Daron Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Shah has a swollen knee, Ayers tendinitis in his leg and Washington suffered a 
concussion in a Wednesday scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bummed because they wouldn't let any of us with concussions play," 
Washington said. "I was going to get some plays at tailback." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is not pleased about spending most of his time at fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 With the regular backs watching, freshman Shaun Williams, who has been force 
fed into the offense in 24 hours after spending a week learning to play safety, 
made the most of his chance. He carried 11 times for 47 yards in an unofficial 
count and was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a great job, just the way he handled the coaching right up to the snap 
count," said Coach Terry Donahue. "Coaches were walking him right up to the 
play and saying 'you go right, you go left.' That's hard for a guy. A lot of 
guys come apart in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other scrimmage performers of note: quarterback Wayne Cook completed 11 of 14 
passes for 130 yards and a 33-yard touchdown to J.J. Stokes. . . . No. 2 
quarterback Ryan Fien was seven for nine for 57 yards and No. 3 Rob Walker was 
seven for eight for 94 yards, 32 of them coming on a leaping touchdown catch by 
freshman Jim McElroy. . . . Also impressive was walk-on fullback Greg Ford, 
from Whittier High and listed at 5 feet 11, 255 pounds, perhaps an inch or two 
taller than his real height. He carried on several short-yardage plays and made 
defensive backs cringe at the idea of tackling him in the open field. JIM

AUTO RACING; MANY DRIVERS BEGIN 1995 RIDE SWITCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HARRIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1994 Winston Cup championship remains up for grabs among at least three 
drivers -- Dale Earhardt, Ernie Irvan and Rusty Wallace -- and already part of 
the attention is turning to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers looking for rides for next season include Brett Bodine, Wally 
Dallenbach Jr. and John Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodine, the only one of the three with a Winston Cup victory, will finish out 
the season with Kenny Bernstein's Budweiser King team. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallenbach apparently drove his last race for Richard Petty Enterprises at 
Watkins Glen after a falling out with members of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti found himself at large after car owner Billy Hagan suspended 
operations on his unsponsored team. The former Indy-car driver is getting a 
trial run in Petty's Pontiac this weekend at Michigan, but Petty is expected to 
try several other drivers in the car before making a decision on a permanent 
replacement at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Parsons and Bobby Hillin Jr., both without rides, also are considered 
possibilities for the Petty job. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Winston Cup champion Bill Elliott is in the final year of his contract 
with Junior Johnson & Associates and is expected to leave at the end of the 
season to rejoin brother Ernie on a team based in their hometown of 
Dawsonville, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 There is speculation that Elliott will take one of Johnson's current team 
sponsors, Budweiser or McDonald's, with him. In any case, both are expected to 
look elsewhere in 1995, with Johnson taking on a new sponsor for holdover 
driver Jimmy Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Speed, who is 10th in the Winston Cup points, surprised a lot of people 
by announcing he would leave Bud Moore Engineering at the end of the season. 
Speed says he'll probably go back to racing for his own team on a limited 
schedule, and that opens an inviting ride for some enterprising driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the big name drivers appear certain to remain with their current teams 
through at least one more season. 
</P>
<P>
 SIGN HIM UP: One driver who will remain with the same team next season, and 
the owner hopes for many years to come, is Jeff Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Hendrick, who also campaigns cars for veterans Terry Labonte and Ken 
Schrader, was delighted with Gordon even before the 23-year-old's victories 
this season in the Coca-Cola 600 and the Brickyard 400 -- two of the biggest 
races on the Winston Cup schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendrick loves telling the story about the moment he decided to hire the young 
stock car star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Atlanta for a Winston Cup race, and they had a Busch (Grand 
National) race down there," Hendrick said. "I was on my way to the suite and I 
saw Jeff go into turn three and four. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went in the corner and the car was loose. It was really hazing the rear 
tires. He was racing (Dale) Earnhardt and (Harry) Gant, and I think he was 
trying to get his lap back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know who he was," Hendrick said. "I told the people I was with to 
watch that car because I thought he was going to bust his butt any second. We 
stood there and he ran a couple more laps. He ran lap after lap after lap and 
someone told me it was Jeff Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just so happened his roommate worked for us. I told (team manager) Jimmy 
Johnson it was a shame the kid had a contract because he had a lot of ability. 
I could see a lot of Tim Richmond style of hanging a car out and doing it lap 
after lap after lap. His roommate told us he didn't have a contract. Two days 
later, he did. With us." 
</P>
<P>
 FORD ROUT: Even with Jeff Gordon winning two weeks ago at Indianapolis in a 
Chevrolet, the NASCAR Manufacturers' Championship is quickly turning into a 
Ford rout. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunderbirds have won 13 of the 20 races this season and own a 159-141 lead in 
the points going into Sunday's race at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 ON A ROLL: Dale Earnhardt, who is just 27 points ahead of Ernie Irvan in his 
bid to join Richard Petty as the only seven-time Winston Cup champions, isn't 
winning races, but he's on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, the defending series champion, hasn't won since the beginning of 
May at Talladega -- his third win of the season. But his third-place finish 
last Sunday at Watkins Glen was his seventh top-10 and sixth top-five in the 
past eight races. 
</P>
<P>
 The only stumble was an engine-related 34th-place finish last month at 
Talladega.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; PROSECUTORS MOVE TO BLOCK HENLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors have asked a federal judge to block Ram cornerback Darryl 
Henley's attempts to play ball out of town, arguing that the player is a proven 
flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief filed Friday, prosecutors said Henley, who recently signed a 
one-year, $350,000 contract with the Rams, took measures to elude arrest for 
five weeks after his indictment on drug charges last October and is "fully 
capable of going into hiding" again. 
</P>
<P>
 The player is accused of running a cross-country cocaine trafficking network 
out of his Brea home, using a former Ram cheerleader as a courier. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley is free on $200,000 bail while awaiting his Jan. 10 trial, but under 
the conditions of his bail, he may not travel beyond the federal court's 
Central District jurisdiction, which includes seven Southern California 
counties.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; VOTING RULE CRIES FOR COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several big-market clubs are still hopeful of returning to the field by the 
lucrative Labor Day weekend, which would require a compromised settlement and 
end of the player strike by early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible? 
</P>
<P>
 Possible, but difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 The major hurdle is the new voting rule requiring 21 of the 28 clubs to 
approve a settlement, meaning eight small-market teams can block any deal that 
does not include a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 How do the big markets overcome it? 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Trash the cap by agreeing to revenue sharing with the small markets 
without linking it to a cap. Give the union unrestricted free agency after 
three or four years in exchange for the elimination of salary arbitration. 
Raise the minimum salary from $109,000 to more than $150,000, compensating 
younger players for the loss of arbitration by allowing them to move up the 
salary ladder more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Raise so much internal havoc and do so much arm twisting that the small 
markets are forced to concede on the cap, finally convinced the union will 
never accept it. The ensuing settlement would be based on the above tradeoff: 
earlier free agency for the elimination of arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Make the magnanimous gesture of saving the postseason for the fans by 
agreeing to waive their right to declare an impasse through 1995 in return for 
the players returning to the field and waiving their right to strike through 
'95 as negotiations continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the small markets willing to listen to compromise? 
</P>
<P>
 Not if Tom Werner's thinking is persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is on the verge of selling his San Diego Padres, Werner has been 
boasting in the inner circles about how much money the small markets are saving 
with this shutdown, a big-market executive confided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great attitude, huh?" the executive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more confounding is this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Werner, on his way out the door, is expected to be among the pool of owners 
and club officials from which five will join the negotiations with the union 
when they resume on Tuesday or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He and Carl Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins, who also has his franchise for 
sale and is expected to be represented at the bargaining table by General 
Manager Andy McPhail, are allowed to sit on the executive council, which is 
charged with the long-term good of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the council chaired by Bud Selig of the small-market Milwaukee Brewers 
and stacked heavily with his allies, including Pohlad, Werner, Jerry Reinsdorf 
of the Chicago White Sox, Jackie Autry of the Angels and Fred Kuhlmann of the 
St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Reinsdorf, Pohlad and Kuhlmann are members of the Player 
Relations Committee, along with Doug Danforth of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who is 
also attempting to sell his team. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a conflict of interest here, or what? Isn't an owner attempting to 
sell his team only interested in creating a system that he perceives will 
increase the value of his franchise? Isn't it a conflict of interest for that 
owner to join committees and negotiations aimed at establishing long-term 
objectives and solutions? 
</P>
<P>
 All of that feeds the feeling that there is more at stake here than Labor Day. 
Within a week or two, the owners could be past the point of no return on the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 It took the owners 18 months to formulate and present their proposal. Selig 
has suggested that the current pain may be worth the long-term gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners may be committed, as the players believe, to breaking the union and 
unilaterally implementing their system. A Labor Day settlement devoid of a 
salary cap might not be acceptable, despite big-market pressure. It might all 
hinge on saving face and how much the big markets start to believe their own 
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Insisting that the industry will lose $100 million this year, Stan Kasten, 
president of the big-market Atlanta Braves, said there are two reasons the 
owners have failed in previous negotiations. The first, he said, is that the 
profitable big clubs would put together a majority coalition and force play to 
resume without anything having been accomplished in the labor talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time (with the minority rule), the eight teams that need the system to 
change the most are in charge," Kasten said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other reason we've lost in the past is that the strikes were basically 
arbitrated by the commissioner, whose only interest was playing the games. 
That's fine, but he achieved that without considering the economic issues, and 
he could influence only one side -- the owners. The point is, we never really 
had collective bargaining with the ability to negotiate evenly across the 
table. That's why there's no commissioner now. This is our one chance, and 
we've got to get it right." NUMBERS GAME 
</P>
<P>
 When Kasten and other club executives say that baseball will lose $100 million 
this year, they are employing an economic theory postulated by the late Walter 
O'Malley. What it means: The clubs aren't going to lose $100 million this year. 
They are going to make $100 million less than the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry revenue for 1994 is projected to be $1.8 billion, with the players 
receiving about 58%. 
</P>
<P>
 The following supports the union contention that the current dispute isn't 
between players and owners, but owners and owners as to how to share their 
increasingly larger slice of the revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, baseball had total revenue of about $720 million. The players 
received about $323 million. That left almost $400 million for the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, in allegedly tougher times, revenue was about $1.88 billion. The 
players received $998 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That left almost $900 million for the owners, or twice the 1985 pie. MORE 
NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
 The owners and their negotiator, Richard Ravitch, like to float the 
$1.2-million average player salary, but there are other ways to look at player 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the average salary is just that, and somewhat misleading. Of the 
746 players on opening-day rosters or on the disabled list, 237 earn more than 
$1.2 million and 507 earn less. 
</P>
<P>
 The median salary of $500,000 is considerably less than $1.2 million. Of those 
746 players, 363 earned less than $500,000 and 361 earned more. Another 22 were 
right at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch has frequently said that a decreasing median proves that fewer and 
fewer players are receiving a larger percentage of the total take, a scenario 
that the players can't be happy with and a reason that they, too, should want 
to change the system, according to Ravitch. 
</P>
<P>
 However, this year's median -- yet to be tabulated through the end of the 
season -- is up considerably from last year's $371,500, which would dispute 
Ravitch's theory. 
</P>
<P>
 The union contends that the players don't care what the median and average 
salaries are as long as they are established by a free market, not possible 
under a cap, according to the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't up to Dick Ravitch or Gene Orza or Soupy Sales to determine salary 
dispersion," union counsel Orza said the other day. "It's a facet of the free 
market, and the players are prepared to live with it, as they always have 
been." LABOR MAN 
</P>
<P>
 He's only a second-year big-market owner who continues to ruffle the hawks' 
feathers by saying the salary cap should be negotiable, but Jerry McMorris of 
the Colorado Rockies would seem to be a natural for the owners' negotiating 
team in the revived talks this week and is definitely expected to be part of 
the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 No other owner has McMorris' labor background. 
</P>
<P>
 He started with three trucks in 1959 and now has 12,000. His NationsWay 
Transport is the largest privately owned trucking company in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 His formula: Buy companies at war with the Teamsters and establish peace with 
the union. He has never had a labor stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relationship built on 30 years of trust and respect," McMorris said of 
his union dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust and respect? Hardly the stuff of the owner-player relationship. 
PERCEPTION 
</P>
<P>
 The American League West doesn't get any better with age. The strike merely 
underscores the mediocrity. The Texas Rangers lost their last six games and 
still led with a 52-62 record, which is better than only three other teams' in 
baseball: division rivals Oakland, Seattle and the Angels.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to draw any satisfaction from a situation like this," General 
Manager Tom Grieve said when asked about being first by default.

RAMS' PASS RUSH MAKES DASH TO SIDELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler dropped back in the pocket and waited, and 
waited . . . and waited. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler camped out and took whatever time he needed to take target practice 
on the Rams' secondary Saturday night, a rare luxury for any NFL quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 So where was the stellar pass rush the Rams had promised their fans this 
season? 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, limping to the sidelines after failing to put any pressure 
on Hostetler, who moved the Raiders up and down the field at will in the first 
half of a 29-20 exhibition victory at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 By late in the second quarter, starting defensive tackle Sean Gilbert and 
defensive end Gerald Robinson were sidelined with ankle injuries, and the Rams 
were forced to line backup linebacker Henry Rolling at right defensive end 
after incompetence by backups left them no other choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't get any pass rush," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. "We gave the 
quarterback plenty of time to throw and move around." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who has started three exhibition games at right defensive end in 
place of Fred Stokes (sprained knee), limped to the locker room to have his 
sore left ankle X-rayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Ernest Jones, a converted linebacker, replaced Robinson but soon was 
pulled in favor of rookie Brad Ottis, a second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ottis failed to get within the same area code as Hostetler on one 
series, the Rams were left with Rolling, who was replaced at outside linebacker 
this week by free-agent acquisition Joe Kelly. "We have to acknowledge that we 
have three starters out," Knox said. "And we're awfully thin out there." 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest loss was Gilbert, who sprained his left ankle when a pile of 
players fell on him with 41 seconds left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said Gilbert and Robinson will be examined today. But defensive end 
Robert Young, who's coming off knee surgery last season, fears the worst with 
Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (trainers) said Sean should be back in a couple weeks," Young said. "He 
hurt his knee and his ankle on the play, and they said the ankle was worse. 
They're talking about doing an MRI (exam). I'm praying for him."  
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Jimmie Jones, the Rams' prized free-agent acquisition from 
Dallas, spent a good part of the first half getting his sore right wrist 
examined before returning in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had entered training camp last month confident that their defensive 
line would be one of their strengths. Perhaps the strength. 
</P>
<P>
 And now? Less than a month into training camp, they have already flown in 
defensive ends Charles Mann and Jeff Bryant for workouts, hoping to add depth 
to the line as Stokes rehabilitates his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, a former Pro Bowl player with Washington, has undergone nine knee 
surgeries, including two in the past year. Bryant had played for Knox in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, everybody looked at us as a strength coming in," Young said. "But to see 
guys like Sean, Gerald and Fred going down week after week is very frustrating. 
They're some of our marquee players." 
</P>
<P>
 After failing to produce a sack in last week's loss to New England, the Rams' 
first-string defense again couldn't get close to Hostetler. Hostetler completed 
12-consecutive passes in one stretch, threw for one touchdown and ran for 
another in leading the Raiders to a 20-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Rams are now 0-3 in the exhibition season and haven't won an exhibition 
game in two seasons. Has this shaken the team's confidence? "The only thing 
that will shake my confidence," Young said, "will be if we lose Sean or Gerald 
for the year."

RAM NOTEBOOK; RAIDERS MAKE THINGS TOUGH AT CORNERS -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a battered Rams' defensive line unable to get any pressure on Raider 
quarterback Jeff Hostetler, it was another rough night for starting cornerbacks 
Todd Lyght and Steve Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyght was beaten three times by the Raiders' Daryl Hobbs, who had third-down 
catches of 24 and 11 yards on two scoring drives in the first half of the 
Raiders' 29-20 exhibition victory at Anaheim Stadium. Lyght had been beaten for 
three touchdowns in the Rams' first two exhibition losses, to Green Bay and New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel, who has been battling a sore thigh muscle in training camp, was beaten 
for a 25-yard touchdown catch by tight end Andrew Glover in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel also was called for consecutive penalties -- pass interference while 
covering Alexander Wright and for grabbing Harvey Williams' face mask on a 
tackle -- to help set up the Raiders' second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New weapon: Starting tight end Troy Drayton, who had not caught a ball in the 
first two exhibition games, caught two for 12 yards in the first half against 
the Raiders. He also caught a seven-yard touchdown pass from Chris Chandler in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Test market: The Rams were supposed to test the new audibilizer that links the 
quarterback to the sidelines as part of a demonstration for league officials. 
But the speakers weren't loud enough, so it went unused. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brawl ball: The Anaheim Stadium security crew got a workout Saturday night. 
Security officers handled at least four brawls among fans, including a 
first-half scrap in the north end zone, where fans threw beer and soda on each 
other, then traded punches. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fan ran out on the field during the two-minute warning in the second 
quarter. He laid down at the seven-yard line, put his hands behind his back and 
waited for security officers to arrive. Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Former Raider Jessie Hester, a free-agent trying to make the Rams' roster, 
caught three passes for 59 yards, including a 45-yard reception on the Rams' 
first drive. . . . Flipper Anderson led the Rams with six catches for 55 yards.

CADIGAN'S GAMBLE ON THE CAP DOESN'T QUITE PAY OFF; FOOTBALL: FORMER USC STAR 
TEARS UP $850,000 CONTRACT WITH THE JETS HOPING FOR $2 MILLION AND, MONTHS 
LATER, HAS TO ACCEPT LESS FROM THE BENGALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All is well today in the world of Dave Cadigan. 
</P>
<P>
 For seven months an angry, unwitting symbol of the NFL's salary cap, he has 
just begun a new job with a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cadigan, who gambled bigger than anyone that the new NFL system would work 
in his favor, will not soon forget how he nearly lost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 And he says he is living proof of the high cost of breaking even. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened has crushed me," said Cadigan, former USC star, former 
first-round draft choice of the New York Jets, currently the most disillusioned 
guard in football. 
</P>
<P>
 He will begin this season with the Cincinnati Bengals, although he ended last 
season as one of the best lineman for the Jets and wanted to stay there. 
</P>
<P>
 He will work for $800,000, but only after tearing up an $850,000 contract in 
hopes of making as much as $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a job thanks to the NFL's new system. But the same system caused him to 
spend a summer looking not at game films, but a digital clock as he lay awake 
deep into most nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still bitter, you're darn right," Cadigan said. "What has happened to me 
has been very hard to accept." 
</P>
<P>
 His dilemma began last season. His best season. 
</P>
<P>
 Blocking for Boomer Esiason, he was a leader of a Jet line that went eight 
consecutive games without allowing a sack and finished with a league-low 21 
allowed sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 He started all 16 games for the first time. He ended the season, at age 28, 
sound and stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 So he plunked down $25,000 and bought out of his contract, tearing up a deal 
that would paid him $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "With free agency in the league, with the kind of money being given to 
offensive linemen, it was my time ," Cadigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did he know that his time would become a torturous one. Because his 
entry into the market was greeted with a sound that he rarely heard during his 
previous six years in the trenches. 
</P>
<P>
 Silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Days became months, and spring became summer, and still, silence. 
</P>
<P>
 He was looking only for the kind of money given free-agent lineman last year, 
something in the range of $2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't think it was asking too much, especially considering guard Bob 
Kratch left the New York Giants for the New England Patriots this winter for 
more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 And still, silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what the hell was going on," he said. "I thought in this new 
system, somebody like me would finally have a chance to benefit. I guess I was 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 When offers finally came in during the last couple of months, they involved 
contracts that would pay him as little as the minimum $162,000, the kind of 
money usually given third stringers and aging journeyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Cadigan finally learned, like countless other NFL players, that last year's 
expensive party was over. 
</P>
<P>
 That money was gone, swept, like everything else, under a $34.6-million salary 
cap instituted in February by agreement of management and the players union. 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't ask Cadigan how he voted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never, ever voted on one decision," Cadigan said. "Not only not on a 
salary cap, but on nothing, never. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene Upshaw (union chief) never came into our locker room and said, 'Here's a 
topic, let's take a vote. Never mentioned the possibility of a salary cap." 
</P>
<P>
 Cadigan said he is not the only one who believes he was blindsided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of friends in this league, and none of them remembers voting 
on this," he said. "Hey, if we had really made this decision, we'd act like men 
and accept it. But we never, ever made this choice." 
</P>
<P>
 While union officials said Upshaw was out of the office this week and could 
not be contacted, union regional director Clark Gaines said he saw Cadigan at 
several meetings of Jet players conducted by the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines then scolded all players for blaming the salary cap for their 
employment situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many times, we are confusing the cap with choices made by general 
managers and pro personnel people," said Gaines, a former pro running back. 
"Back when I was released, and everybody else was released, it was because we 
didn't fit into somebody's plans, we were too slow, we had lost a step. Now, 
everybody just blames the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cap can't be the source of every problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Steinberg, Jet general manager, admitted that the cap was the reason 
Cadigan was not re-signed by the Jets at a substantial raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not keep both Dave and Jim Sweeney (guard) under the cap," Steinberg 
said, referring to another Jet free agent. "Basically, I said whoever could 
reach agreement with us first would get the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweeney received an offer from New Orleans, there was a sense of urgency 
there, so we did his deal first, and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets recently offered Cadigan a $400,000 contract, but he would have to 
serve as insurance for the man who replaced him, Roger Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
 "After being a starter all this time, I told them to take the offer and shove 
it," Cadigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 So he continued to wait. He attempted to stay in playing shape on a high 
school field near his Leucadia home, with retired lineman Rich Moran. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't slept more than two or three hours a night since March," Cadigan 
said before he signed with the Bengals. "I tried to watch football on TV and it 
made me sick, I couldn't do it. Something like this has never happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 He finally cut his losses on Friday, signing a non-guaranteed contract with 
the Bengals, 16 days before the start of the season, hopelessly late for a 
lineman in a new offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is this year's salary $50,000 less than he originally was scheduled 
to receive. His salary for 1995 and 1996 also are less, at $700,000 and 
$600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Some would say that by finding a job at a comparable salary, Cadigan is a good 
example of what the union claims is the fairness of the salary-cap system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who perform will ultimately be rewarded. . . . They may have to 
change teams, but the money will be somewhere, and they can get it," said Doug 
Allen, assistant executive director of the union. "Your high-salaried teams 
will lose some players, but those players won't disappear, they will just go to 
lower-salaried teams, like the Cincinnatis and Tampa Bays." 
</P>
<P>
 Cadigan prefers to think he was an example of something entirely different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming into the off-season, I was the type of guy least likely to be affected 
by a salary cap," Cadigan said. "I'm not real old or real young. I'm in my 
prime. I am coming off a good year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened shows just how dangerous a cap can be."

A 10-YEAR-OLD SYSTEM THAT REVOLUTIONIZED SPORTS; PRO BASKETBALL: THEN-NBA VICE 
PRESIDENT DAVID STERN HELPED PUSH THROUGH A PLAN FOR THE 1984-85 SEASON THAT 
WAS THE START OF THE SALARY CAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It really happened, so help us Richard Ravitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners and the players association agreed that the league was at a crossroads. 
Teams were facing financial difficulties, some severe enough to consider 
folding or moving, and the owners let the union look at their books to prove 
it. The players, understanding that lost teams meant lost roster spots, agreed 
to a limit on salaries. The owners, in turn, agreed to share a determined 
portion of the revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the NBA in 1983. This was the foundation of the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a recession mode," said Charles Grantham, executive director of the 
National Basketball Players Assn. and then the second in command to Larry 
Fleisher. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, accepted history has it that the league and an executive vice 
president named David Stern deserve credit for a system that revolutionized 
sports. One problem -- half the idea was borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern took the idea of promising a percentage of the owners' take from the NFL 
union, which had made that one of its demands in the strike of 1982, and made 
that the compromise. The players gave in on allowing a ceiling on their 
salaries in exchange for a slice of the pie, however underbaked it was in the 
tough economic times. Stern's behind-the-scenes prodding pushed the deal 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was announced March 31, 1983, and took effect in the 1984-85 season. 
Players got 53% of the defined gross revenue -- primarily gate receipts and 
local and national television contracts -- and the ceiling was set at $3.6 
million per team, with exceptions given to five clubs already over the limit. 
As profits increased in succeeding years, so did the salary cap, doubling 
within four seasons and then nearly quadrupling to $14 million in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 Players and owners got rich together as worldwide interest in the game surged 
with the talent, personality and marketing of superstars Magic Johnson, Larry 
Bird and Michael Jordan. The partnership paid off with unimagined riches. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Properties, which oversees merchandising and had brought in only $65,000 
to the 23 teams in 1983-84, delivered $4.2 million in domestic and 
international sales for the 27 clubs in 1992-93. Revenue from sky boxes in new 
arenas brought millions more. Likewise, money from advertising in the arenas. 
And none went to the players as part of the 53%. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the cap had served its purpose. The NBA had not merely 
stabilized, which would have been a reasonable enough goal when it was 
implemented, it had flourished. Even without access to the unexpected revenue, 
player salaries were averaging more than $1 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the summer of '94. 
</P>
<P>
 The players and owners are negotiating a new agreement, a process that 
undoubtedly will run into 1994-95 without, it seems, the threat of a strike or 
lockout. The cap reached $15.175 million last season and will climb again when 
next season's figure is announced, probably within five days. But the players 
are pushing for elimination, pointing out that they agreed to a ceiling when 
times were tough and that times are no longer tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question," Grantham said. "It's a dinosaur now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may have been necessary at the time of recession, and now that we're in an 
expansion mode, there's clearly not a need for it. (The owners) want it. They 
want it to protect their profit margin." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners counter that if it's not broken, don't fix it. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik: "We think that having this system in 
effect for the last decade, along with the great talents of a lot of the 
players we had in that decade, has been instrumental in turning the NBA around. 
. . . We think a system like this is absolutely necessary for that success to 
continue."

 You are about to go mano a mano with women's world champion arm-wrestler Dot 
Jones. You plant your right elbow on the table and her bear-size paw envelopes 
your dainty digits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ker-r-r-pow!!! 
</P>
<P>
 You lose. It took only a millisecond. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-foot-4 and 233 pounds, Jones is an imposing figure.  
</P>
<P>
 She is strong -- bench presses almost 300 pounds -- and muscular. During her 
daily workouts at a North Hollywood gym, she radiates vein-bulging intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is an assistant track coach at Harvard-Westlake High and also works as 
an actress.  
</P>
<P>
 She is a tough-looking woman. Her curly blond hair flies wildly. She grunts 
during sets of curls and easily handles large, heavy plates of weights. 
</P>
<P>
 But ask about her world arm-wrestling championships and the 30-year-old 
giggles.  
</P>
<P>
 She finds it amusing that she has won 11 consecutive world heavyweight 
arm-wrestling titles, but she is dead serious about the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 She trains hard and travels the globe to compete. It's just that she often 
thinks the whole thing is like a weird dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is funny," Jones said. "It was a freak accident. I was 19 years old 
and I was at a festival with a friend and she said I should enter the 
arm-wrestling competition. So I thought, 'What the heck.' I did it because I 
liked the trophy. But I didn't know what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 She easily won the competition and pocketed $250. The following month she 
entered her second event, the World Championships in San Francisco, and swept 
the title and the $750 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Oh, my God, this is hilarious!' I just couldn't believe I was 
doing that," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents might not share her glee. Since her auspicious debut, she has 
dominated the sport and owns a remarkable 500-1 record.  
</P>
<P>
 She blames her only loss on a torn triceps muscle suffered during her other 
athletic career. She's also a shotputter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was the country's top junior college shotputter at Modesto College in 
1983 and was an All-American and school record-holder at Fresno State.  
</P>
<P>
 She still holds the national junior college mark of 51 feet 1/4 inch.  
</P>
<P>
 After completing her college career, she placed 11th at the 1988 Olympic 
trials and seventh at the '92 trials. She still ranks 16th on the all-time U.S. 
list with a personal best of 56-6 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was fun, but you can't control what your opponent does," Jones said. 
"What I really love about arm-wrestling is that it's a contact sport. I like 
the fact that it's physical." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' longest match lasted 12 seconds. "She can beat them as fast as she 
wants to go down," said Lori Cole, a 10-time lightweight world champion from 
Encino.  
</P>
<P>
 "She's beyond strong. There is no word for it. She beat me in her first 
tournament when she was 19 and I couldn't believe it. At the time I had already 
won a couple of titles and I was experienced." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is expected to win another title when she defends her crown in the World 
Championships in San Francisco on Friday. At stake is $2,500. There are no 
weight divisions for the women at the World Championships, so Cole probably 
will face Jones at some point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be extremely tough," Cole said. "I really enjoy arm-wrestling 
Dot because she's very fair and she's one of my favorite people, but she's 
virtually unbeatable." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones grew up in Hillmar, a small, Northern California farming community with 
a population of about 2,000. She played basketball and volleyball in high 
school and competed in track and field. 
</P>
<P>
 She grew more than five inches between eighth and ninth grade and started 
weight training in an effort to strengthen her gangly frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said she was offered a basketball scholarship to attend Nebraska but 
gave up the sport to concentrate on the shotput. 
</P>
<P>
 A severe knee injury, however, forced her to quit the sport after the '92 
Olympic trials. Coaching is the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone she worked with got a lot better because she is an outstanding 
coach," Harvard-Westlake Coach Jonas Koolsbergen( said. "She brought enthusiasm 
to the program. Kids really responded to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones majored in criminology at Fresno State and spent four years as a 
juvenile probation counselor in Fresno before coming to Southern California. 
She moved here in 1991 after being picked as a main character in a syndicated 
television pilot called Knights and Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is similar to American Gladiators, in which strength is required. 
Jones played a vindictive character called Lady Battleaxe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just mean," Jones said, laughing. "There was a tug of war and I had to 
chase knights around on skates. It was a blast." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting and coaching keep her busy, but not enough to quit arm-wrestling. She 
plans to compete as long as her right arm functions. "I want to do it till I 
die," she said.

PRODUCTIONS FOR SMALL SCREEN PAY BIG DIVIDENDS IN O.C.; ADVERTISING: 'THEY ARE 
OUR BREAD AND BUTTER,' A FILM OFFICIAL SAYS OF THE TV COMMERCIALS AND 
INFOMERCIALS FILMED LOCALLY.

<P>
 In the living room of a fashionable hillside home, Ken Kerry presses a few 
timid consumers to share their true feelings about a vacuum cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting barefoot on the shag carpeting while television cameras are trained on 
the five average folks arrayed before him, Kerry asks questions like: "What 
does the name Dirt Devil mean to you?" 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry draws a momentary hush. Panelists soon pipe up they never owned 
Dirt Devils, but wished they had after seeing how the Cyclone Deep Cleaner 
sucked a fresh stain of Coca-Cola from a white throw rug. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm dumbfounded the Cyclone could get it out that quick," said one 
participant. 
</P>
<P>
 As hokey as it might sound, this is serious business. Kerry is a senior vice 
president for Script to Screen Productions in Santa Ana, a company that 
specializes in making half-hour infomercials for television. 
</P>
<P>
 While movie fans focus on the glamour of major film projects, companies like 
Script to Screen are quietly pumping out dozens of infomercials, 30-second 
commercials, training films and other types of productions locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they make up the vast majority of film work in Orange County. "They 
are our bread and butter," said Cristi Silverberg, director of the new county 
Film Office. "They are as important to us as the feature filmmakers." 
</P>
<P>
 Feature filmmakers may come to Orange County a few times a year. But small 
independent producers are working here constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Script to Screen officials said they make a concerted effort to keep its 
production local -- simply because that is where most of their workers live. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seventy percent of the budget stays in Orange County. We pretty much keep it 
here," Kerry said in a brief interview before taping began. 
</P>
<P>
 Director of production Denny Koska said that the company only goes to Los 
Angeles County for special occasions. One was the recent shooting of a 
television advertisement for Slick 50 engine oil additive starring "Coach" 
television show star Craig T. Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wouldn't come to Orange County," explained Koska. The spot was shot 
instead along a desolate road in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Dirt Devil infomercial, Script to Screen was hired to shoot a 
demonstration of the product to consumers -- then gauge their off-the-cuff 
reactions and testimonials. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was chosen by the Ohio advertising agency for the project, 
according to Stacey L. Vaselaney, public relations director for Dirt Devil 
parent Royal Appliance Manufacturing Co. of Cleveland who had come to watch the 
filming. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dirt Devil spot was providing four days of work for a crew of about 25. In 
addition, there were plenty of spinoff benefits for companies like the catering 
company that served lunch and Patty Anfinson, who opened her Fullerton home to 
the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 The crews came early and transformed the interior of the Anfinson residence 
into a jumble of electronic gear and electric cords snaking across the carpet. 
Cardboard panels were placed over marble floors. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen counter was filled with things like boxes of breakfast cereals, 
bottles of Hershey's chocolate syrup and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers grape 
drink ready for dumping on the demonstration rug. Just to make sure, a sign was 
stretched across them that said, "Do not eat." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make all kinds of messes," Koska promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Script to Screen has made an effort to be a good neighbor. A worker greeted 
arriving crew and cast in the street to make sure they were legally parked. 
Signs placed on the sliding glass door to the patio told everyone to keep it 
closed and to wipe their feet before entering. 
</P>
<P>
 Anfinson takes the controlled chaos in stride, taking time only to herd her 
golden Labrador, Sara, to an upstairs bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very, very considerate," she said of the film crew. Anfinson offered 
up her house to the Script to Screen once previously, for an Estee Lauder skin 
care infomercial -- and got a kick out of seeing her floral-print couch and 
pink marble fireplace as the backdrop on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 People who offer their homes to film crews are usually compensated from $200 
to $12,000 a day, industry sources say. Anfinson said she is getting something 
less than $1,000 for the single-day shoot at her home. 
</P>
<P>
 The county film office is compiling lists of people who want to offer up their 
homes to film crews. In this case, Anfinson's place was chosen because she is a 
friend of Koska's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumers, too, have various connections as well. A young aspiring actor 
named Kyle Jones is an Anfinson family friend, and Cindie and Mike Weis wrote a 
letter to Royal attesting to their love for their new Cyclone Deep Cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while during filming, producers ask details of their participants. 
"What's your favorite spill on a hardwood floor?" inquired Randall Hoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Juice," Kyle Jones replied. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tape rolling, Jones later proclaims that he has an old orange juice 
stain at home that just won't go away. So he gets to soak the carpet in juice 
and uses the Cyclone to cleanse it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So now I won't have to worry about that spot. It won't be such an eyesore," 
he said. Where the Money's Spent 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the most recent year for which information is available, the film and 
television industry spent $216 million in Orange County for site rentals, 
transportation, catering and other goods and services. Top 10 film production 
sites, in millions of dollars: 02,21,08 City Amount 1. Santa Ana $77.8 2. 
Anaheim 16.5 3. Huntington Beach 10.8 4. Newport Beach 9.6 5. Los Alamitos 8.7 
6. Orange 8.1 7. Fullerton 6.8 8. Irvine 6.5 9. Cypress 5.8 10. Laguna Beach

MOVIE MOOLAH; ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE THE GROWING PROFIT -- AND 
PAIN -- OF HOSTING HOLLYWOOD TV AND FILM CREWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a recent Sunday, police barricades brought traffic -- and shopping -- to a 
halt on what is usually the busiest day of the week for the little antique 
stores clustered around the Orange Plaza park. 
</P>
<P>
 A hostage situation? Traffic accident? No, it was simply the filming of a 
Toyota commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours of empty sidewalks and stores have left merchants in an uproar. They 
complain that customers couldn't get to their businesses, resulting in the 
collective loss of thousands of dollars in potential sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange's experience highlights the growing unease of living with film 
production as the county steps up efforts to lure Hollywood producers to shoot 
on location here. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, there is no question there is disruption in some quarters," 
said county Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who took the lead in creating an 
Orange County Film Office. "But when they produce here, they spend money here," 
and disruptions are minor compared to the huge economic benefits of filming on 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Hollywood has taken over buildings and streets in Los Angeles. 
Local businesses delight as the film crews lavish tens of thousands of dollars 
on equipment rentals, food and accommodations, but neighbors can recoil once 
the glitter wears away. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has had its share of film experience -- though not nearly as 
much as county officials would like. The county has served as host for portions 
of numerous movies, from Cecil B. DeMille's silent version of "The Ten 
Commandments," to the current box office smash "Clear and Present Danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise shuffled through the Santa Ana Train Station at 
the conclusion of "Rain Man." Emilio Estevez perfected his team's slap shot in 
"Mighty Ducks II" at The Pond of Anaheim. Sean Connery as James Bond destroyed 
an offshore drilling rig in the 1971 spy flick "Diamonds Are Forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Without really trying, Orange County was second in film industry expenditures 
among California counties in 1992, the year in which the Alliance of Motion 
Picture and Television Producers trade group conducted a study of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a pittance by comparison: nearly $15 billion in payroll and 
spending by the industry in Los Angeles County compared to $216 million in 
Orange County. And those Orange County figures included salaries of workers who 
merely live here but work in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is quite sure of how much money was spent by Hollywood producers 
shooting on location in Orange County. That amount, too, is small compared to 
the amount spent in Los Angeles because of the work rules that govern film 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 On major pictures, unions have a rule that makes their members eligible for 
overnight stays or bus transportation for jobs farther than 30 miles from 
Hollywood. Only the northern edge of Orange County -- from Seal Beach to 
Fullerton -- is within the circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost, however, does not explain it all. The county has never actively 
solicited relationships with Hollywood until now, and misunderstanding has been 
allowed to grow on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think we're a bunch of snobbish Republicans, or Disneyland, or orange 
groves," said Cristi Silverberg, the director of the new Orange County Film 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse, each of Orange County's 31 cities has different 
requirements for film permits. While Newport Beach can sometimes process 
applications in less than an hour and charges $200 a day to film, Mission Viejo 
requests a 30-day advance notice and charges $500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverberg said she hopes to standardize the process with a one-stop center or 
by encouraging cities to charge the same fees. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego, which is cited as a model of film friendliness by Vasquez, 
abolished its fees and now only requires basic information about where and what 
a crew is filming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't streamline the permit system. We said we weren't going to have 
permits," said Wally Schlotter, the city's film commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a near 50-fold increase, over 15 years, in the amount of 
spending by film crews in the city to about $31 million in 1993. San Diego is 
home to two syndicated television series -- "Silk Stalkings," and "Renegade," 
with Lorenzo Lamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Sea World sent out a questionnaire asking visitors why they came to see 
the marine amusement park a few years back, it was surprised to see how many 
checked the box marked other," Schlotter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other" turned out to be viewers of "Simon and Simon," the since-canceled 
network version of the San Diego-based television detective show in which star 
Jameson Parker receives a wet smooch from a killer whale in the opening 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important as bringing film and television crews to San Diego, 
Schlotter said he sees his role as keeping tabs on them while they are there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the chance, they will break the rules -- get the shot, and leave town," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach discovered that dilemma the hard way in 1986. A boat being blown 
up in the Back Bay area for "Assassination," a movie starring Charles Bronson, 
was supposed to burn for 35 seconds. Instead, it blazed for 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion and fire stopped traffic on Coast Highway and halted flights 
from John Wayne Airport. Sparks scorched canvas covers on about 40 other boats, 
set a house ablaze, and caused smoke and cinder damage to others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such a painful movie, I have not ever watched it," said Glen Everroad, 
the city's revenue manager. Nevertheless, he added, the city learned a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned for help to a local film industry veteran, Joseph Cleary, who 
operates a small company that helps filmmakers find locations on boats or 
ships. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the disaster, Joe cleaned out Jacuzzis, washed windows and took damage 
estimates," Everroad said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Cleary coordinates crews coming into the city, often acting as a liaison 
between them and local merchants or homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 When Volvo filmed an expensive television commercial near the Balboa Pier last 
summer, Cleary found a way to park an unexpected bus-sized dressing room truck 
without offending merchants. To stay on good terms with the locals, Cleary made 
sure that the crews ordered 60 pizzas a day and distributed them to locals on 
the beachfront. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest concern is not to dump on your neighbor," Cleary said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Orange could have used someone like Cleary last month for the 
filming of the Toyota commercial on the most profitable day of the week for the 
antique and curio dealers who cluster near the circle park called the Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owners say they didn't have a chance to protest the plan to allow filming 
on Sunday before the City Council. And after approval came, some said they 
received a memo from the Toyota commercial's producer, informing them that 
filming would be wrapped up at 1 p.m. on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 That schedule would have been all right, because the sidewalks usually fill in 
the afternoons as families wander over from church services and lunch. Instead, 
morning overcast prevented shooting -- and the crews worked until 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian McBroom said that business at his family-owned J&J Antiques and 
Collectibles was off $500 for the day. At one point, he said a woman coming to 
pick up a purchase was held behind the barricades for half an hour before being 
allowed through. 
</P>
<P>
 "It created tremendous turmoil," said nearby antique dealer Chris Harwood. 
"There's no way in the world we would have permitted (filming) on a Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the commercial will only be shown overseas -- in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 If Orange County wants a bigger piece of the film industry action, it had 
better learn to adjust to dealing with movie crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to convince people once in a while that they have to put up with a 
little inconvenience," Roger Mayer, president of media mogul Ted Turner's 
Turner Entertainment Co., said at a recent symposium on film production in 
Orange County. "Everyone would like to have (a movie) shot in the next block." 
</P>
<P>
 Such inconvenience is worth it, local leaders say, because clearly 
identifiable images of Orange County seen around the globe will entice more 
people to visit, providing a boost to the county's all-important tourism 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Often Orange County is merely a stand-in for somewhere else. When free-lance 
location manager Steve Dayan brought a production to Laguna Beach, it was 
because the local shores were a substitute for Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found a perfect Hawaii look-alike," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if a city is portrayed by name, it is not always portrayed favorably. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hit summer movie "Speed," Los Angeles is home to a mad bomber. When 
star Keanu Reeves boards a bomb-rigged public transit bus, he is threatened by 
a pistol-waving passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Los Angeles film officials are tickled that "Speed" was shot in the city, 
rather than becoming yet another "runaway" production. Never mind the 
less-than-ideal portrayal of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone understands we're talking about fantasy," said Patti 
Stolkin-Archuletta, director of the California Film Commission in Los Angeles. 
"It was an action movie. I don't know that it sent a negative message about 
L.A. I thought it could be Anywhere, U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Ariel Penn, film liaison for the city of Pasadena, is fond of pointing out 
that Lyle Lovett and Whoopi Goldberg, playing two Pasadena police detectives in 
the 1993 Roger Altman film "The Player," were about the only two honest 
characters in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities can do little to regulate content. "Your film commission is not 
employed to be a censor," said San Diego's Schlotter. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, Orange County has so little major film production that 
censorship is the least of its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are in the works to promote the county at a major annual show for 
location managers and to invite them on a bus trip through the county to see 
photogenic spots like the old courthouse in Santa Ana, where a sequence in Rob 
Reiner's summer film "North" was filmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, movie scouts are likely to draw a blank when asked what they can 
shoot in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "You probably have things there that none of us know anything about," said 
Turner Entertainment's Mayer. "When people are sitting around planning 
production, it's not in their heads to say, 'Let's go to Orange County!' " 
Sharing the Wealth 
</P>
<P>
 Movie production expenditures are divided among many sources. Here's a sample 
of who gets paid for what: 
</P>
<P>
 Set design, construction, etc.: 19% * Lumberyards * Furniture stores * Art 
galleries * Home decorating stores 
</P>
<P>
 Makeup, hair & wardrobe: 5% * Hairdressers * Makeup artists * Beauty-supply 
stores * Local clothing retailers 
</P>
<P>
 Lighting, camera & sound: 10% * Camera rentals * Lighting technicians * 
Musicians 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation and location: 19% * Trucking companies * Shipping companies * 
Location rental * Restaurants * Caterers * Police/fire personnel * Hotels 
</P>
<P>
 Special effects and post-production: 20% * Effects houses * Editing companies 
</P>
<P>
 Other: 27% * Stage rentals * Insurance * Stunts

 Movies vs. Television 
</P>
<P>
 Feature films boast big-name stars, but TV shows are the economic bread and 
butter in terms of production dollars. Despite attempts to lure projects out of 
state, most films and television shows are still shot in California. U.S. movie 
and TV productions by location for 1992: 03,12,12,20 Outside Partially/entirely

IN SEARCH OF . . . THE PACIFIC RIM; EQUAL PARTS HYPE AND HOPE, A DURABLE 
BUZZWORD REFLECTS ASIA'S GROWING PROMINENCE IN THE WORLD ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SCHOENBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Few places on Earth have been described in such rich statistical detail. But 
then, the Pacific Rim is an idea in search of a definition, and it needs 
something tangible to glue it together. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why anyone with a stomach for numbers can discover the growth rate of 
its aggregate GNP, the output in megawatts of its new power plants or the 
purchasing power of its emerging middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorize some of this minutia and you're a Pacific Rim expert, ready to give 
Rotary Club speeches extolling the tremendous opportunities awaiting Yankee 
entrepreneurs in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the popular American consciousness, Asia no longer seems a remote and 
incomprehensible place on the far side of the world. Gone is the shroud of 
mystique that once placed the continent in a fog of time and distance, where 
vaguely recent wars were won and lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Asia is in your face. It's right off the shores of California, Oregon and 
Washington, an enticing fountain of riches. Asia was reinvented about a decade 
ago as a new creature of economic geography called the Pacific Rim. We've been 
lectured about it so long that the region touches and challenges Americans with 
surprising immediacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased awareness, however, doesn't necessarily mean enhanced understanding. 
The Pacific Rim is as much image as it is phenomenon, a trendy concept that 
competes with new world order and information superhighway for the most dubious 
buzzword of our time. Yet somewhere behind this facile idea is a hard nub of 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Europhiles who once comforted themselves with traditional cross-Atlantic ties 
need only glance at recent trade statistics to see the spreadsheet writing on 
the wall. In 1993, U.S. exports to Asia exceeded those to Europe for the second 
year in a row. Two-way trade with Asia was $361 billion, compared to $239 
billion for Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 There's a local angle too. With its large concentrations of Asian immigrants 
and Asian Americans, Southern California is a hub for regional networking and 
agile, small-scale entrepreneurship. The rest of the population benefits as 
well. As the state struggles to restructure its sagging economy, rising 
merchandise trade with Asia is one of the few causes for optimism on the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, more than a third -- about $100 billion -- of all U.S. transpacific 
commerce funnels through harbors and airports in the Los Angeles Customs 
District, making Los Angeles the capital of Pac Rim East. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these beguiling figures shouldn't be cited without also mentioning another 
naked statistic: While trade with Europe is in a reasonably cozy balance, trade 
with Asia is alarmingly out of line, with a whopping U.S. deficit of $98 
billion. More than half that imbalance is with one country, Japan, but the 
problem of closed markets and protectionism is regionwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Such worrisome details, however, tend to get lost in the zealous syntax of 
Pacific Rim Speak, as propagated by Pacific Rim consultants, Pacific Rim 
scholars and Pacific Rim pundits. 
</P>
<P>
 It was some time around the dawn of the audacious 1980s that the term Pacific 
Rim evolved from obscure geological jargon to one of the most impressionistic 
concepts ever known to the dismal science of international economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Its meaning, which once was understood to describe volcanoes and earthquake 
faults ringing the Pacific Ocean, is now stretched to suggest just about 
anything from relocating America's manufacturing base in cheap labor markets 
overseas to speculating on real estate in Vietnam to dining, eclectically, on 
Pan-Asian California cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days, the energy that gives the Rim its dynamism springs not from 
molten rock and steam, but from the presence of a vast, powerful and 
interconnected economic and cultural community," declares the Pacific Rim 
Almanac, an 824-page compendium of essays and statistical charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet behind the barrage of economic data and chirpy Pac Rim boosterism lurks a 
great irony. An older, blatant ignorance of Asia -- the Occident's habit of 
exoticizing the Orient -- has been replaced by an equally shallow sheen of 
comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they've heard of the Pacific Rim, but one in four Americans between the 
ages of 18 and 24 can't find the Pacific Ocean on a map, according to a 1988 
Gallup survey commissioned by the National Geographic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. ambassadors stationed in Southeast Asia complain that very few 
American corporate leaders take the trouble to visit their region, home to some 
of the fastest-growing markets in the world. Instead of gaining firsthand, 
nitty-gritty knowledge and building critical personal relationships, the 
executives rely passively on intermediaries, lamented the ambassadors at a 
recent forum for U.S. business audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 A simplistic vision of opportunity in Asia persists, colored, as always, by 
the fantasy of easy wealth. China's jackpot-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow market of 
1.2 billion consumers comes to mind long before one considers the latent chaos 
of its fragile, sclerotic and corrupt authoritarian regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combined Asia Pacific economies are projected to grow (to) about twice 
the size of a post-1992 'unified Europe,' reaching an estimated $13 trillion by 
the beginning of the next millennium," predicted the Pacific Rim Almanac's 
editor, Alexander Besher. 
</P>
<P>
 Could be. But this prophesy was written in 1990, before Tokyo's speculative 
financial mania turned to muted panic, tumbling the Japanese economy into its 
worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't mean other Asian economies aren't still booming, which they are. 
But they're not necessarily thriving on exports to Japan. The American economy, 
warts and all, remains the market of choice, the key engine of growth, the 
principal dynamo behind these Asian dynamos. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the image of a self-sustaining Pacific Rim juggernaut prevails, giving 
the name the power of a magical incantation -- and the snappy appeal of a 
Madison Avenue jingle. 
</P>
<P>
 The business world's fascination is well illustrated by a Pacific Rim 
statistic not often cited in the seminars and chicken dinner speeches: The 
California secretary of state's office lists 297 registered corporations and 
limited partnerships enamored enough with the concept to use the words Pacific 
Rim in their name. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the way of all fads, this one seems to have spent some of its fury. As 
many as 157 of these enterprises, records show, have been dissolved, suspended, 
canceled or otherwise rendered inactive since going to the trouble and expense 
of filing legal papers with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of the technically active Pacific Rim companies are difficult to 
find, assuming they are still in business at all. 
</P>
<P>
 An outfit evocatively named Naturally Beautiful Nails of the Pacific Rim, for 
example, had no telephone numbers on record for offices in Santa Monica or 
Pacific Palisades, where it was incorporated on Nov. 26, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Same goes for Pacific Rim University in Apple Valley, the Pacific Rim Chamber 
of Commerce in Encino, Pacific Rim Concepts of Lancaster and Tsunami Pacific 
Rim Cafe in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors of exotic Asian weapons shouldn't bother to look up Norwalk-based 
Pacific Rim Ordnance in the 1994 Pacific Bell Smart Yellow Pages, because the 
number they'll dial has been disconnected, and there is no new number. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet quite a few Pacific Rim namesakes are still conspicuous in their 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, Pacific Rim Printers-Mailers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Candice ("you don't need my last name"), the office manager, said she wasn't 
sure why the printing and direct-mail shop calls itself Pacific Rim. "The 
owners just thought it was a good idea when they renamed the company five years 
ago," she said. "We really have nothing to do with the Orient." 
</P>
<P>
 If the term Pacific Rim has a hyped quality, the media can take some of the 
blame. The Los Angeles Times, which sometimes refers to itself as a Pacific Rim 
newspaper, has mentioned the words in 2,547 news articles published since 1985. 
The term Atlantic Rim has appeared in only four articles -- all in the context 
of ironic references to the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's no joke to many California entrepreneurs, who profess to know exactly 
what they mean by calling themselves "Pacific Rim." 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider it to be a buzzword for the 1990s," said Harvey Rosen, president 
of Los Angeles-based Pacific Rim Aluminum, a company that trades in containers 
full of aluminum ingots and scrap. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen, a commodities broker for 20 years before starting his company in 1988, 
chose the name because Asian markets were hot at the time. "I viewed it as the 
strongest area of growth in the world," he said, "and I wanted my company name 
to speak about that vision." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, however, fickle trends in global commodities markets make the 
United States the most lucrative trading scene, as the domestic economy lurches 
out of recession. "Our Asian business is not as good as we would like," Rosen 
concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be unfair to omit Latin America in a serious treatment of the Pacific 
Rim, though this is perhaps one area where the concept suffers from serious 
fatigue. Nonetheless, it's certainly on the Rim, geographically speaking. At 
last count there are 11 Latin American countries with the Pacific Ocean lapping 
at their coastlines; their combined population totals more than 200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico and Chile are the avant-garde, trying to tap into whatever 
opportunities are out there on the Cuenca del Pacifico. Both joined the Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), a fledgling regional forum defined by one 
wag as "four adjectives in search of a noun." The idea is to jawbone -- and 
engage in trade -- with the industrializing Asian "tigers" they hope to 
emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel Pacific," said Mario Matus, economic consul at the Chilean Embassy in 
Washington. "We've joined APEC, and 31% of our exports are to the Pacific Rim. 
Easter Island belongs to Chile, so we also feel somewhat Polynesian." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, for its part, experienced a gusher of Japanese investment in its 
maquiladora (border factory) programs in the 1980s, as leery manufacturers 
sought footholds inside the fortress walls of the emerging North American 
free-trade area. New Japanese investment has dried up in recent years, however, 
as it has in California and elsewhere on this side of the Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pacific Rim" has yet another meaning for Dana Yamagata, creative director for 
Pacific Rim Advertising in Los Angeles. The agency specializes in crafting 
"politically correct language" for ads targeting the fragmented ethnic Asian 
markets in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use the term to unify the Asian countries," Yamagata said. "There are more 
than 80 different ethnic groups in Asia, so I guess the Pacific Rim is a 
politically correct term to describe a common economic experience and put a new 
light on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Like any good buzzword, Pacific Rim has nuances, which vary depending on who 
is uttering the term.  
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, kan-taiheiyo (more popularly pashifuiku rimu ) is a sanitized way of 
talking about economic integration in Asia without drawing attention to Tokyo's 
obvious dominance in the region. The last thing Japanese diplomats and captains 
of industry want to do is provoke bitter memories of the wartime Greater East 
Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Japan's euphemistic term for its ambition of 
controlling the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pacific Rim concept originally was started in discussions by Japanese 
politicians," observed Itsuki Charles Igawa, a naturalized U.S. citizen and a 
former political science lecturer at UC Irvine, who started the consulting firm 
Pacific Rim Communications in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's far from clear how or when the term started taking on its 
present load of economic and cultural innuendo. The 1988 edition of Webster's 
New World Dictionary carries the phrase, offering a geographic definition and 
adding, "especially with respect to . . . trade relations, political alliances, 
etc." of the countries bordering the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Rim Imports, a novelty goods wholesaler based in Seattle, claims to 
have been using the name for the past 30 years. Cathy Stockstill, regional 
sales manager for the company at the Los Angeles Mart, said the firm does 
"millions and millions and millions" of dollars in business, designing and 
importing from Asia such holiday items as Santas and angels. 
</P>
<P>
 She attributes the firm's name to founder Ronald (Buzz) Benson.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Pacific Rim is definitely a 'Buzz' word," Stockstill said. "And you can 
quote me on that." Advantage: Asia 
</P>
<P>
 Though exports to Asia are outpacing exports to Europe, U.S. merchandise trade 
with Europe remains in balance while the deficit with Asia is rising 
precipitously. U.S. trade with the Pacific and Atlantic rims, in billions of 
dollars:

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: INVESTORS CAN GUARD THEMSELVES AGAINST FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Willie Sutton was asked why he robbed banks, he responded, "Because 
that's where the money is." 
</P>
<P>
 If the infamous thief were alive and plying his trade today, he might work a 
reference to mutual funds into his answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The highly visible growth of the mutual fund industry has, unfortunately, 
attracted the attention of criminals. Bad checks and other kinds of fraud 
against fund companies by unsavory characters take a toll, though precise 
figures aren't available. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to measure the scope of the problem, because fund companies are only 
now starting to share crime information with each another through a centralized 
database. And firms are somewhat reluctant to publicize such matters for fear 
it might shake investor confidence. However, in most cases, shareholders acting 
responsibly are not accountable for fraud in their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "My general impression is that there is more fraud," says Natalie Shirley, 
vice president and general counsel at ICI Mutual Insurance Co., a Washington 
firm that operates the 2-year-old database. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't sense that there's rampant or widespread fraud," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund companies have very good safeguards in place for detecting fraud, 
according to Shirley. If more infractions are being noted, that may have 
something to do with the industry's larger size and better detection devices. 
</P>
<P>
 One characteristic of mutual fund fraud is that it tends to be concentrated 
around money market accounts with check-writing privileges. Shirley says she is 
aware of three fund companies that have lost at least $200,000 each from 
illicit check-writing activity within the past year or so. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common scheme involves check kiting, whereby a person writes checks 
against a fund account knowing that there is not enough cash to cover the 
transactions. Merchants who accept these checks are the ones who usually get 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
 More troublesome for fund companies is the theft of valid checks from 
legitimate shareholders, Shirley says. Because there is cash behind them, these 
checks will usually clear, and a couple of months may pass before the fund 
company, merchant and investor find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley speculates that some such checks are stolen in shipment, but she 
points out that others are nabbed by people close to an investor, such as a 
relative.  
</P>
<P>
 In such cases, state laws outline when the shareholder or the fund company 
might be liable, Shirley says. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope of such check crimes has decreased from the 1970s, says Joseph A. 
Recomendes, president of the MFS Service Center, a division of Massachusetts 
Financial Services of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the early days of money market funds, and fund companies were still 
getting their feet wet handling checks and their attendant bank-like features. 
More effective safeguards have since been installed, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other examples of fraud involve counterfeit checks -- more easily produced 
today with advanced copying machines -- and forgeries that make use of fake 
signature-guarantee stamps. The signature-verification procedure, performed by 
banks, typically applies to share redemptions worth more than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all mutual fund improprieties involve outside parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Recomendes tells of a supervisor who worked for an independent transfer agent 
-- a company responsible for maintaining shareholder records. The supervisor 
was caught entering trades to her personal accounts at favorable prices. She 
had been able to conceal this by entering her trades at the computer terminals 
of other employees who were away from their stations while still logged on. 
</P>
<P>
 The same supervisor also was found to have manipulated the personal account 
information of a fellow employee she held a grudge against. The supervisor was 
fired, Recomendes says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dormant shareholder accounts and those owned by investors no longer living at 
the address of record are most vulnerable to internal manipulation, according 
to Recomendes. 
</P>
<P>
 But manipulation of records by outside computer users also presents a danger. 
Recomendes says hackers haven't caused losses yet, but they are considered a 
significant threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend is to let more outside people into your system, such as 
broker-dealers who want to look up information on an account," Recomendes 
explains. "While this has improved the speed and accuracy of providing service, 
the downside is that it gives more opportunity to hackers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what can fund investors do to reduce the admittedly low chances of being 
victimized or having their financial affairs disrupted? Here are some 
suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lean toward large, well-known fund families for the bulk of your investing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want a family with deep pockets and a reputation to uphold -- a firm that 
will be quick to cover their tracks and make investors whole" in the event of 
losses, says Jay Schabacker, an investment newsletter editor and fund book 
author in Potomac, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Schabacker says he likes to stick with roughly the 50 largest firms, most of 
which are well-known from the advertising they do. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sign up for the wire-transfer redemption privilege, which allows you to wire 
proceeds to your bank when you decide to sell shares. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no chance of fraud with a wire-transfer arrangement," says Stanley 
Egener, president of Neuberger & Berman Management in New York. "From an 
investor's standpoint, it's foolproof." 
</P>
<P>
 * Be careful to guard your account statements, checks, Social Security number 
and other account particulars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a fair number of checks and shareholder ID numbers stolen by someone 
close to an investor," says Shirley. "You need to safeguard these." 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't sign up for check-writing privileges if you don't expect to make much 
use of this service, as this is the area where most fund fraud occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Verify checks and account statements for accuracy. And if you have moved 
recently, make sure the fund company has your current address. 
</P>
<P>
 In the overall scheme of things, third-party fraud isn't something you should 
spend much time worrying about. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of fund groups are highly responsible, vigilant and 
reputable. If there hasn't been much publicity in this area, it's because 
investors generally haven't been harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 In fraud does occur, losses would most likely be absorbed by the fund company, 
the transfer agent, an insurance company or a merchant, but not innocent 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The party who doesn't pay is the shareholder," says Recomendes. "Customers 
are always made whole."

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: BANKS STRONGLY PUSHING 'SECURED' CREDIT 
CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumers who want to rebuild recession-scarred credit histories can take 
heart. Banks that once shunned customers with checkered pasts are now 
aggressively trying to lure them in with "secured" credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 And they're offering unusually good deals -- at least comparatively speaking 
-- to show that they mean business. 
</P>
<P>
 Secured cards, offered to people with no credit history or who have had credit 
problems, are similar to ordinary credit cards except that to get one, you must 
deposit money in a bank. The amount of your deposit is usually the same as your 
credit limit on the card. The bank generally pays you interest on your deposit. 
You must pay an annual fee for the card, as well as principal and interest 
payments if you maintain a revolving balance. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based banking behemoths Wells Fargo and Bank of America have 
both recently introduced new and improved secured credit cards. Sanwa Bank in 
Los Angeles launched a low-rate secured card last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, New York-based Citibank, which has offered a secured card since 
1991, recently cut the interest rate on its secured cards. Citibank's secured 
rates are now no higher than rates charged to good credit risks. 
</P>
<P>
 These banks are only indicative of what's happening everywhere, says Robert 
McKinley, publisher of CardTrak, a Frederick, Md., credit card newsletter. 
Where there were only about 35 secured card issuers in 1990, there are now more 
than 400, he says. And rates and fees have plunged. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, these cards were often prohibitively expensive. Many came with 
interest rates of 20% or more and annual fees ranging from $35 to $90. But that 
wasn't all. Customers would also have to pay "application and processing" fees 
that could add up to $100. Then, if their payments were late, or if they wanted 
access to their deposits, they were charged additional fees. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of these fees remain -- particularly for late payment -- 
application and processing fees are now rare. Better yet, many big banks offer 
their secured cards at the same interest rate as ordinary cards. At Citibank, 
Bank of America and Wells Fargo, for example, secured cards cost the same as 
standard cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanwa Bank takes it a step further. Last week it launched a 15.9% secured 
card. Sanwa's ordinary credit card customers -- the "good risks" -- pay 17.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual fees on secured cards range from about $18 to $75. But these fees are 
often waived if you have checking account overdraft protection linked to the 
credit card, bankers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the sudden push for "bad risks"? 
</P>
<P>
 Two reasons. First, there are available customers in this market. Second, 
banks have learned that these customers are not as bad as they thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The average U.S. household already has about nine credit cards -- three of 
which are multipurpose bank cards, McKinley says. Because nobody needs that 
many cards, credit issuers know that they've got to steal market share from 
their competitors if they want to grow. In the past they've done that by 
marketing to "affinity" groups, such as frequent fliers, senior citizens and 
animal lovers. More recently, they've even started cutting their stratospheric 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But once all the Elvis Presley fans were spoken for -- and credit card rates 
hit historically low levels -- the industry was forced to plumb areas it had 
traditionally avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "This market is so saturated that issuers are turning rocks over looking for 
customers," McKinley says. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, bankers learned some encouraging facts about secured card 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, there are a lot of them. 
</P>
<P>
 MasterCard International, which turned its attention to the secured card 
market last year, found that there were roughly 26 million potential 
cardholders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, the vast majority of that number, roughly 20 million individuals, 
were not "bad" risks -- people with past bankruptcies or payment problems. They 
were simply new immigrants, 18-year-olds, divorcees and widows who simply 
hadn't established credit in their own names. And this group, thanks to aging, 
divorce and immigration, grows by roughly 6 million to 7 million individuals 
each year, says Brian Schwartz, MasterCard's director of new market 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 If that wasn't enough, some of the veterans in the secured card market 
maintain that secured card customers are good risks. Citibank, which monitors 
such things, says 70% of its secured card holders prove to be so reliable about 
paying their bills that they "graduate" to ordinary unsecured cards in less 
than two years. (In other words, they don't have to deposit money to keep the 
card.) 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: If you want credit and don't yet have it, now is the time to 
apply. But shop around for banks that will give you a reasonable interest rate 
on the card and also pay a decent rate for your deposits. And ask how long you 
must maintain a reliable payment history on the secured card before the bank 
will give you a regular card. Charging It 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three years, the number of secured card issuers has soared . . . 
02,06,19 Year Number of Issuers 1992 35 1993 120 1994 400 . . . and the average 
interest rates charged have fallen. 03,06,24,24 Year Unweghted average rate 
Weighted average rate* 1992 18.41% 19.61% 1993 17.78 19.13 1994 14.96 18.70 * 
Average interest rates are weighted according to receivables. This figure gives 
more weight to interest charges of large issuers.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: TIMING SALE OF AN ASSET LATE IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: My husband and I own a lot for which we paid $25,000 decades ago. It is now 
worth about $750,000. We are retired; I am 61 years old and he is 71. We are 
financially comfortable. I want to sell the lot, pay the huge tax bill and 
invest the remainder. My husband wants to hold on to it. He says that upon the 
death of one of us, the survivor would get an immediate step up in value and 
could sell the lot without suffering the huge tax bite. What should we do? -- 
M.N.H . 
</P>
<P>
 A: Since there is no need for immediate income, the key to making the right 
decision, our experts say, is determining the intersection of two all-important 
factors: the rate of expected appreciation of the property and your life 
expectancies. 
</P>
<P>
 A:ccording to actuarial tables, a 71-year-old male has an average life 
expectancy of 12.7 years and a 61-year-old female can expect to live another 19 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's assume your property is appreciating at the rate of 3% a year. Now let's 
try to see where the two factors intersect. Appreciating at 3% a year for the 
next 13 years, the property would be worth about $1.1 million at your husband's 
theoretical death. At this point, you could sell the property and pocket the 
proceeds without paying taxes on the accumulated appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 If, however, you sell the property now, you would be subject to a combined tax 
rate of 35% on your $725,000 profit, for a tax bite of nearly $254,000. You 
would have less than $500,000 left to invest. If you could invest it at 6% 
tax-free, you would have a nest egg of slightly less than $1.1 million at the 
end of 13 years -- about what you would have if you were to sell it in 13 years 
as a widow. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that you know what the process is, you can start substituting different -- 
and perhaps more realistic -- investment return and property-appreciation 
assumptions into the formula. Perhaps a 3%-a-year appreciation rate is too 
high. Perhaps you cannot get a 6% tax-free return on an investment. Perhaps one 
of you is in poor health. These are the factors you have to consider when 
evaluating how to proceed. Figuring the Tax Basis for an Inherited Bond 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My wife inherited a Savings Bond from her grandmother that is now worth 
about $1,100. What is my wife's tax basis in the bond? -- D.W.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Her tax basis is the original purchase price of the bond paid by her 
grandmother. Like annuities and installment sale notes, appreciated Savings 
Bonds are what are known as "income in respect to a decedent"; none are treated 
to a step up in value to the date of death of the donor, and heirs inherit the 
original tax basis. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it may be possible for the bond's appreciation to be declared as 
taxable income on the final tax return of your wife's grandmother. If her 
grandmother had little or no income during her final year -- perhaps because 
she died early in the year -- the tax would be minimal or nothing at all. In 
that case, the tax basis of the bond would be reset as of your wife's getting 
it. Whoever is filing the grandmother's final tax return should be able to 
assist you. Review Revocable Living Trusts Every 5 Years 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have a revocable living trust that is dated October, 1991. Will I have to 
review the trust at any particular time to keep it active? S.P . 
</P>
<P>
 A: Unless there are major changes in the estate tax law, your own life 
situation or that of your beneficiaries or trustees, you should review your 
trust about every five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Why even bother with a review? Because, the experts say, there could be minor 
tax code changes of which you are unaware. Further, this review should serve as 
a reminder that any assets you acquire after creating the trust should be put 
in the trust's name if you want them to be included in that portion of your 
estate. (You should be doing this all along, but in case you forget, the review 
should check into this.) Finally, your attorney or financial adviser isn't 
likely to charge you much more than $100 or $200 for a routine review -- money 
well spent if it spots any problems. Spouse's Social Security Benefits After 
Divorce 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am a divorced woman in my late 60s and was married for more than 20 
years. The divorce was final years ago. Am I entitled to any Social Security 
benefits on my ex-husband's account? -- R.S.G . 
</P>
<P>
 A: A divorced woman is entitled to receive Social Security benefits 
accumulated by her ex-husband if they had been married for at least 10 years 
and he is already drawing benefits. However, if he is still working, she may 
draw benefits if the couple has been divorced for at least two years and the 
wage earner is at least 62. Husbands may collect on their former wives' 
benefits under the same rules. 
</P>
<P>
 If your ex-spouse is alive, you may start collecting benefits at age 62. 
However, your monthly benefits will be just 37.5% of the wage earner's 
benefits. If you wait until age 65 to claim benefits, the payment is 50% of the 
wage earner's benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 If your former spouse is dead, you may start collecting benefits at age 60. 
However, your monthly payments will be just 71.5% of what the wage earner was 
entitled to receive. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage increases until reaching the full 100% if the ex-spouse waits 
until age 65 to begin receiving benefits. If the deceased had started 
collecting benefits at age 62, the amount the former spouse is entitled to 
receive is pegged to the amount the recipient had been getting at the time of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are disabled, you may start collecting at age 50 if your former spouse 
is dead. If the ex-spouse is alive, 62 is the minimum age at which a disabled 
spouse may start collecting benefits.

WHY SEND BABES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why on earth do you repeatedly send "Babes in the Woods" (Weekend Escape, July 
31)? No, I'm not referring to the fact that you covered an all-female camping 
trip. I'm referring to the fact that once again you have sent complete novices 
to write about the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not send writers who enjoy the wilderness? Your writers have trekked to 
Yosemite, Mineral King National Park and Idyllwild, all great locations to 
relax and commune with nature. Yet, every report was filled with complaints 
about things that come with the territory, things like sweat and dirt. Anyone 
who leaves the beauty and tranquillity of Yosemite and can't even drive home 
without stopping for a shower and room service in a $238.71 hotel room, should 
be assigned to write the Scottsdale resort review instead.

TUNING IN ON AN ENABLING BIRTH DISORDER; GENETICS: O.C. MAN FINDS HE'S NOT 
ALONE IN HIS IMPAIRED MENTAL CAPACITY BUT INNATE MUSICAL ABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-nine years ago, a doctor at a Denver mental hospital sat a sickly, 
slightly retarded boy named Tim Baley down at a piano and watched him run his 
fingers across the ledges and valleys of the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The puzzled doctor began jotting down notes. The boy had already undergone 
hundreds of tests, but medical minds were still having a hard time coming up 
with a diagnosis for his developmental problems and poor health. 
</P>
<P>
 The piano test only deepened the mystery. Most kids who came through the ward, 
the ones with Down's syndrome or autism, would gleefully crash their palms down 
on the keys. Not Baley. "The doctor told us Tim was fascinated by it," Baley's 
father recalls, "and they said we should try to encourage him." 
</P>
<P>
 It probably would have been hard to discourage him. Baley, now 42 and living 
in Anaheim, has became a polished concert pianist who has performed in nine 
countries. He can't drive, he can't make change for a dollar, nor can he read 
the music he plays so artfully, but his breathtaking abilities regularly bring 
audiences to their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Baley's story would be an incredible one if he were unique, but it is even 
more compelling to realize, as doctors have in recent years, that he is not one 
of a kind at all. In fact, last month Baley stood on a San Diego stage with 
four other Orange County musicians who share his unusual mix of profound 
ability and disability. 
</P>
<P>
 Baley and his band-mates have Williams syndrome (WS), a rare congenital 
disorder that bolted from obscurity in the past few years to offer scientists a 
tantalizing riddle about the workings of the human mind. How can the condition 
stunt most learning and intelligence but leave other complex skills, such as 
verbal abilities, unscathed or, seemingly, even enriched? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a beautiful mystery, just beautiful," said Ursula Bellugi, director of 
cognitive neuroscience at the Salk Institute in La Jolla. "There is an exciting 
possibility here." 
</P>
<P>
 Baley shrugs when asked about the unusual nature of his talents. "I'm not 
handicapped," he told a reporter, wagging his hands in the air. "I have all my 
fingers." 
</P>
<P>
 The debut performance of Baley's band, the Williams 5, was at a national 
convention of the Williams Syndrome Assn., a group that has grown from 150 
families to 2,500 in less than a decade. The mood at the event was celebratory 
and it was clear that the group's members are enthused about the increasing 
attention WS is receiving from researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is about to blow wide open," said UC Irvine biology 
professor Howard Lenhoff, whose daughter, Gloria, has WS and performs with the 
Williams 5. "The mystery of this syndrome is being solved." 
</P>
<P>
 The syndrome was named for J.C.P. Williams, a physician who in 1961 thought it 
was unusual that four infants in his care displayed a mild retardation with 
unusual facial traits coupled with a heart defect. Williams, then on staff at 
the Green Lane Hospital in New Zealand, typed up a paper, but his findings went 
largely unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-two years later, geneticists at the University of Utah studying heart 
defects made the next major WS discovery when they happened upon the cause of 
the mysterious syndrome. Their findings, which tie WS to a missing chunk of DNA 
material in chromosome 7, touched off a flurry of scientific interest in the 
birth disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Utah researchers found that people with WS are missing a gene responsible 
for manufacturing elastin, a protein that allows the body's tissues to flex and 
recoil. This would seem to be the culprit behind the heart ailments and other 
tissue problems that plague people with WS. Also missing are some genes of 
unknown purpose that surround the elastin agent, creating a blank spot on the 
body's genetic map. 
</P>
<P>
 These blank spots are intriguing, Bellugi said, because they are likely tied 
to the unusual WS cognitive development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The elastin-producing gene nicely accounts for many of the physical 
manifestations, such as the heart problems and maybe the facial traits, but we 
still have to map out the rest of the missing genes," Bellugi said. "That is 
where the potential for discovery lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Bellugi and a team of specialists at Salk are focusing on how and why people 
with WS have their language and social skills spared even though their 
condition causes malformations throughout the brain. How can a WS child weave 
an outlandish and vivid make-believe tale, complete with complex grammar and 
creative word choice, but not be able to tie his shoes? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, if found, could shed light on the theory that language is somehow 
separated from other functions of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking data, Bellugi and her colleagues compared children with WS to 
youngsters that have the same IQ but were born with Down's syndrome. The two 
groups were about even in their lack of problem-solving abilities, but when 
asked to name as many animals as they could in 60 seconds, the groups gave 
markedly different responses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Down children named the animals a first-grader might, such as dog, cat and 
horse, while the WS subjects rattled off obscure or exotic creatures such as 
weasel, newt, salamander, Chihuahua, ibex and yak. People with WS have also 
shown a startling ability to remember faces, far better than most "normal" 
people, which complements their tendency to be highly sociable and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lenhoff, whose 39-year-old daughter, Gloria, can speak six languages and 
sing opera, the stunning dichotomy of skills among WS subjects defies any easy 
categorizing. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we really say they are retarded or developmentally disabled?" Lenhoff 
asks. "In many ways, some of these Williams kids are superior to a lot of 
typical people in verbal skills or music. I say the best thing to call them is 
mentally asymmetric. They are different, really, not disabled." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Williams 5 raucous debut performance, a parent of one of the 
performers scanned the faces of the exuberant, dancing crowd of children 
bunched up near the stage. "They all look related, they all look like they 
could be family," she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 People with WS, especially when they are younger, share elfin features, with 
almond-shaped eyes, wide mouths beneath small, upturned noses and oval ears. 
One out of every 20,000 infants is born with Williams. Most will have a heart 
murmur and a narrowing of the arteries, leading to coronary ailments that can 
range from minor to life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williams babies also often suffer severe gastric problems and slow growth. 
Many parents must cope with their children's sleeplessness and irritability, 
conditions doctors say is likely tied to high calcium levels. 
</P>
<P>
 As they grow older, youngsters with Williams show delayed physical and mental 
development. Many of the childhood medical ailments, except for the gastric 
problems, tend to tail off, but muscle and skeletal maladies often set in. 
</P>
<P>
 People with WS also share a love of conversation (parents among the WS circles 
call it a "cocktail personality") and music that goes far beyond the 
hyper-chattiness and love of song found in most all children. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Williams 5 wound there way through a set that included "The Rose" and 
"Country Road," their younger counterparts at the foot of the stage would 
alternately dance wildly and stare intently at the performers, seemingly 
transfixed by the melody and rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenhoff is eager for the scientific testing, which so far has dwelt on 
language abilities, to venture into the group's affinity for music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait," he said. "It is the aspect that fascinates me most. I'm sure 
my daughter is part of the reason for that. But I also think the connection 
with music is what makes Williams so different." 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter, the soprano in the Williams 5, is an accomplished stage 
performer who has toured concert halls around the world. She has perfect pitch, 
as most people with WS do, and she also has the hypersensitivity to sound, 
called hyperacusis, that comes with the condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can hear dog whistles," Gloria confides with a grin. "But loud noises, I 
hate loud noises. They scare me and I just . . . lose it." 
</P>
<P>
 The link might be cultivated and highlighted by a new music camp for 
youngsters and adults being offered by the Williams Syndrome Assn. at a 
performing arts camp near Tanglewood, Mass. The camp debuts this weekend with a 
program for 40 students that will include voice, musical theater, piano and a 
variety of recreational activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really just the start of something bigger, I hope," said Lenhoff, who 
helped organize the camp, which his daughter is attending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someday I hope, we all hope, to have a residential, music and arts college." 
</P>
<P>
 The Williams 5 are finished with their set and a Elvis impersonator is on 
stage at the Bahia Hotel convention room, delighting the room full of dancing 
children with a hip-shaking rendition of "C.C. Rider." Gloria, smiling, is 
watching the faces on the packed dance floor and trying to answer a hard 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would I do without music? I don't know. I can't live without it." Her 
brows knit in an effort to imagine the world without the one thing, sometimes 
the only thing, that makes complete sense to her. "No songs? It would be . . . 
torment. Just torment." 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria asks for another question, hoping to do better this time. What is your 
secret wish? "Well, I have always wanted to go on 'Wheel of Fortune,' " she 
says, but then changes her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would want people to understand us," she says. "If people could see what we 
can do, all of us, what we can do as a person, then they would call us what we 
really are. Mentally gifted."

EL TORO FLIGHTS TO SIGNAL START OF BASE PHASEOUT; MILITARY: TWENTY-FOUR JETS 
WILL LEAVE O.C. 'FLY-DOWN' INDICATES TO SOME THAT CLOSURE PLAN IS IRREVERSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-four airplanes will fly out of here on Wednesday -- for good. 
</P>
<P>
 The two squadrons of FA-18 fighter jets will take off from El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station, engage in training exercises over the lawns and freeways of 
Southern California and, sometime around 3 p.m., land at the Miramar Naval Air 
Station in San Diego, where they will be greeted with the hoopla normally 
accorded a significant military event. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, that's exactly what this "fly-down" is: the first phase of a 
much-debated closure of a military base that the Defense Department has 
scheduled for a complete shutdown by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I had dared to hope that . . . this would never take place," said 
Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who has been a staunch supporter of 
keeping the El Toro base open. "I think when those squadrons move that the 
(closure) is done and not retrievable." 
</P>
<P>
 "It marks the beginning of the end of El Toro . . . (and) a new beginning for 
Miramar," agreed Frank Collins, an administrative assistant to Rep. Randy 
Cunningham (R-San Diego). Miramar has been a Navy base for the past 40 years, 
but the Navy will hand it over to the Marines as part of the second round of 
base closures and consolidations ordered by Congress in the wake of the end of 
the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Pentagon first announced its intention to close El Toro back in 
March, 1993, many local officials protested that it made more economic sense to 
close Miramar instead. In a series of public hearings, the debate raged. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, however, military planners stuck to their guns, and the Marines 
are on their way back to Miramar, where they were stationed from 1943 to 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be good for San Diego and San Diego's economy," Collins said of the 
impending move. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, El Toro's closure will mean the loss of both an economic and 
social asset to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 A study released by Gov. Pete Wilson last year projected that the base closure 
would cost Orange County an estimated $60 million in military and defense 
industry contracts that generate a of $175 million for the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with the scheduled 1997 closing of the Tustin Marine Corps Air 
Station, the study found, Orange County's employment picture could be eroded by 
nearly two percentage points as a result of the base shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the uncertainty of what the future holds. "It's like anytime 
you lose a neighbor," said Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond. "You'd rather 
not see them go. You never know who will be moving in next." 
</P>
<P>
 The base's personnel also brought a measure of diversity to Irvine schools, 
said Hammond and other city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was good having kids going to school and playing on the athletic 
field with (military) kids from all over the country," Hammond said. "It 
provided a nice mix to Irvine schools." 
</P>
<P>
 When the federal government purchased land for the base from the Irvine family 
in 1941, the area was home to the world's largest lima bean field, according to 
historian Judy Liebeck, author of "Irvine," a history of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebeck said that the military's land purchase "was the beginning of the end 
of the Irvine Ranch" because it allowed the county to reassess the value of the 
Irvine family's vast agricultural holdings. The purchase caused a property tax 
increase that eventually made it more profitable for the ranchland to be 
developed than to remain in agricultural use, Liebeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents know the base through the daily roar of jets overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived in (the) Northwood (district of Irvine) for a number of years, and I 
could always tell the state of world tensions based on the number of flights 
over my house," Hammond said. "We didn't have to watch the nightly news. We 
could just tell" by listening for the military jets. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the base's lasting legacy on the neighboring area is not yet 
clear. A debate is raging on whether the base should be converted into a 
commercial airport. And Liebeck points out that the base contains hazardous 
waste sites that will take years to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 The military pullout is expected to bring dramatic changes to the mostly 
undeveloped farmland and open space around the base. Liebeck predicted 
substantial housing, hotel and commercial developments in the area when the 
pullout is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hammond and others said El Toro has been a positive force in the 
community. "The military has been a good neighbor to Irvine for many years and 
we, as a city, are sad to see them moving," Hammond said. "Deep down in our 
hearts, many of us hoped something would happen and they would end up staying." 
</P>
<P>
 This first wave of Marine departures from El Toro has already been delayed 
several times because of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally scheduled for last month, the flight of the two FA-18 squadrons -- 
VMFA (AS-121), an active-duty squadron attached to the 3rd Marine Aircraft 
Wing, and VMFA-134, a reserve squadron -- was put off because $1 million 
allocated by the government for the first phase of the move did not arrive on 
schedule. It was postponed again to allow planners to complete an environmental 
assessment regarding the relocation of the FA-18s. 
</P>
<P>
 "A combination of things have slowed down the process," said Lt. Brad Bartelt, 
a spokesman for the Marine Corps. While the military would still like to 
complete the move by 1997, he said, "in reality we're starting to bump up 
against" the 1999 deadline for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine personnel spent much of last week preparing for Wednesday's flight of 
the FA-18s by transporting a variety of equipment by truck to the San Diego 
Naval base. Once in Miramar, Bartelt said, the equipment is being carefully 
stored in several empty hangars the two squadrons will occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 24 jets, he said, three support units will be making the 
trip by truck over the next three weeks. All told, he said, 410 active-duty 
Marine personnel and 470 reservists are about to have their jobs permanently 
transferred to Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean that all of them will immediately be moving their living 
quarters, Bartelt said. Because most Navy personnel at Miramar live off base in 
civilian housing, he said, there are only 527 housing units -- most of them 
already occupied -- on the San Diego base. That number includes 180 new, 
four-bedroom apartments scheduled to be officially opened the same day the 
FA-18s arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of the El Toro Marines will be housed in those new apartments, 
Bartelt said. About 62 more will be placed on waiting lists to occupy the new 
units as more become available. And the rest of the Marines, he said, will 
remain in their present housing at El Toro and Tustin, commuting daily to San 
Diego at least until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The military's ultimate goal, Bartelt said, is to have about 3,200 housing 
units at Miramar, roughly the same number that already exist or have been 
approved at El Toro and Tustin. Given the vagaries of funding and policy, 
however, that probably won't happen until the turn of the century, according to 
Bartelt. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he said, most of the estimated 11,000 Marines scheduled for 
transfer over the next three to five years will be living in San Diego "on the 
economy" or -- in non-military terminology -- in rental housing outside the 
base's limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just is a drastic difference" between the number of units available in 
San Diego and at El Toro, Bartelt said. "For our Marines, it's a quality of 
life issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines arriving Wednesday are expected to get a warm reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying in by fours, the fighter jets will land at one-minute intervals. Then 
the Navy will officially welcome the Marines to Miramar by indulging in the old 
Navy tradition of "piping" them aboard. After having his name announced, the 
commander of each incoming squadron will march forward to a position on the 
field where a representative of the Navy will honor him by blowing a special 
whistle, similar to the whistles heard on ships. 
</P>
<P>
 The welcoming ceremony is expected to be seen by about 150 invited guests, 
mostly military and civilian dignitaries, as well as the spouses of the Marines 
whose units are flying in. Speakers at the event will include Navy Vice Adm. 
Robert J. Spane, Marine Maj. Gen. Drax Williams, Rep. Cunningham and several 
members of the San Diego City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it will be back to work for the relocated flying squadrons as they 
continue their regular training routines while spending the next several weeks 
unloading numerous boxes in hangars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military is used to moving constantly," said Pete Ciesla, assistant 
transition coordinator for the Marines. "This is just another move for our 
people."

TIGHTEST JUVENILE HALL IN NATION PLANNED IN SYLMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Juvenile Hall will become the largest and most 
jail-like county youth facility in the nation when a high-security wing for 
violent teen-agers is completed two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 The $16-million project also propels the Sylmar facility into the midst of a 
national debate over whether incarceration or prevention is the best way to 
combat the growing numbers of violent youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't anything in this country that is going to come close to L.A. when 
this facility is built," said Earl Dunlap, executive director of the National 
Juvenile Detention Assn., which oversees the more than 400 county youth 
detention facilities in the country. "But," he added, "they can't build their 
way out of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 No one disputes the stark facts: Violent crime among youths is on the rise 
across the country, with children accused of murder, rape, aggravated assault 
and robbery growing 68% from 1988 to 1992, according to a recent study by the 
U.S. Justice Department. In the city of Los Angeles, there was a slight decline 
last year, but the numbers remain astonishing: nearly 10,000 youths were 
arrested for violent offenses last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are meeting a need," said Ed Anhalt, supervisor of the sprawling 453-bed 
San Fernando Valley Juvenile Hall, which for the past few years has struggled 
to accommodate an average of 620 young inmates at a time, about 50 of them 
considered violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a statement on what is happening in the community: we have an increase 
in violent offenders," Anhalt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the high-security wing at San Fernando, which began last 
month, is expected to be completed in 1996. When done, the wing will include 
two high-security buildings -- containing 160 beds -- equipped with a high-tech 
audio system for staff and visual monitors through which they can watch the 
youths' movements. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans also call for an automatic gate and fence surrounding the facility and a 
more secure entryway for the hall, with a bulletproof room to protect staff 
from new inmates or visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other county juvenile halls, San Fernando is a holding place for youths 
awaiting a judge's sentence, which for the most serious offenders could mean a 
transfer to the California Youth Authority -- the state's youth prison system. 
But of the more than 26,000 young prisoners held at San Fernando Juvenile Hall 
every year, officials said only the hardest-core -- those who have killed, 
raped, beaten or robbed, or are suicidal -- will be placed in the high-security 
unit to prevent them from harming others or escaping. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past five years, Anhalt said, there have been two successful 
escapes from the Juvenile Hall, although in both cases the escapees were 
recaptured after three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the hall more secure is reasonable, conceded Dunlap of the national 
detention group, but county officials should strive to keep the environment 
less jail-like. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of massive security is fairly unusual," he said. "They are just 
building a jail for kids. . . . Everybody says the problem in L.A. is 
different, but there are a lot of other jurisdictions in the country that are 
coming up with alternatives to lock-down." 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers are paying the price for the hard-line approach to rising youth 
crime, Dunlap said. In Los Angeles, he estimated, it costs $45,000 to jail a 
juvenile for a year, compared to about $2,000 to put one youth through a year 
of intervention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But across the nation, rising youth crime figures have provided fuel for the 
fight to take a tougher stance against criminal children, which in turn may 
increase the stress on the juvenile justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 State legislators have pitched more than a dozen bills that increase penalties 
for youths, most of which are still pending. Their suggestions range from 
establishing longer sentences for minors who commit violent crimes to trying 
youths as young as 14 as adults in murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, provisions to allow adult trials for suspects as young as 13 and 
to make gang membership a federal offense are part of the hotly debated crime 
measure by the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Many youth experts insist these get-tough efforts are not the best antidotes 
for a juvenile justice system already lagging in its response to the surge of 
violent offenders. They argue that the money would be better spent on 
rehabilitation and diversion programs that target at-risk youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Locking up more people is not a solution to juvenile delinquency," said John 
J. Wilson, acting administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention, which coordinates federal efforts with state and local 
programs. "Yes, we have to protect the public, but we should be putting the 
money into the front end -- through prevention programs." 
</P>
<P>
 The proportion of youths incarcerated for violent crimes in California grew 
from 44% of juvenile inmates in 1987 to 61% in 1992, California Youth Authority 
data shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city of Los Angeles, there was actually a slight decrease in the number 
of violent youths apprehended last year: 9,970 youths were arrested for violent 
crimes in 1993, down about 5% from the 10,477 kids arrested in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the local decrease may be the result of preventive Los Angeles 
city ordinances -- including laws making it illegal to sell knives, blades or 
other stabbing weapons to anyone younger than 18, and a 10 p.m. street curfew 
for minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, local Juvenile Hall authorities say they remain in the midst of a 
serious housing crisis that needs to be addressed with beds, not words. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are severely limited in our space to accommodate them," Anhalt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile Hall officials so wanted to build the high-security addition at the 
San Fernando complex that they lobbied for two years to get financing, finally 
successfully tapping into Proposition 86, a $500-million state bond issue 
designated for construction of juvenile halls and jails. The county provided 
25% of the project's cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other juvenile halls that serve Los Angeles County -- Los Padrinos in 
Downey and Central in Los Angeles -- have what are considered high-security 
units. But, like other halls across the country, their security measures are no 
match for what is planned at San Fernando, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it is only a lack of money -- not a lack of support for the concept -- 
preventing such upgrades from being made countywide, juvenile officials said. 
As a stopgap measure, officials at Central Juvenile Hall have strung barbed 
wire atop fences to prevent escapes, and they expect to install an audio system 
soon that would link staff throughout the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the luxury of gates and bulletproof windows around here," said 
Michael Edwards, assistant superintendent of Central Juvenile Hall. "Right now, 
our staff's eyes and ears are our audio and visual equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, Central Juvenile Hall is the largest juvenile detention facility in 
the country, with technically 565 beds, although 111 of them cannot be used 
because they are in buildings destroyed by the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Juvenile Temporary Detention Center in Chicago currently is tied with San 
Fernando for second-largest juvenile facility in the country, with about 450 
beds. Los Padrinos has 431 beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts on both sides of the debate about how to address youth violence agree 
that the recent nationwide increase in juvenile crime can be traced to a number 
of factors, including the availability of guns, the prevalence of gangs and 
societal factors such as a popular culture that glorifies violence, the loss of 
a sense of community and child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts also agree that the most successful programs are those that target 
youths while they are still in their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep kids in the community -- sometimes still detained (at a local 
juvenile hall) or at home -- and offer programming (to get) them out of 
problems that they have there," said Pam Allen, director of special projects 
for the Coalition for Juvenile Justice in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen stressed the importance of providing a support system for minors who 
have been incarcerated to help them make the transition back into society. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Fitzgerald, director of Hope and Youth, said the very things that 
increase the crowding of the juvenile justice system -- including the harsher 
penalties proposed by politicians -- are really just a Band-Aid for much bigger 
problems. Hope and Youth works with at-risk children and teen-agers in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dealing with 11-, 12- or 13-year-olds," Fitzgerald said. "We can 
either lock them up or have more community-based programs where we can work to 
find the root cause of these behaviors." 
</P>
<P>
 Child abuse is one of the root causes for the rise in juvenile arrests, 
according to Wilson, with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention. Particularly among the most violent youths, he said, "if you look 
at the history of these children, you will find a surprisingly high percentage 
of them have been victims of abuse and neglect." 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying recently about the treatment of juveniles in the criminal justice 
system to the House subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice, Wilson said: 
"Building more juvenile halls may be necessary as a short-term approach, but 
you have to look at the big picture. We have to put money in places that will 
make the kids safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't do that, all we will do in the foreseeable future will be to 
build more facilities."

 A boat on a tour of a flooded river in western India capsized, killing 22 
people, including 14 schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The news agency Press Trust of India said Saturday that the accident occurred 
Friday on the Chulbandh River in the western state of Maharashtra, about 625 
miles south of New Delhi. Most rivers in India are overflowing their banks 
after the monthlong monsoon rains.

A WILLIAMS CHILD PARENT'S EDUCATED GUESS ON ORIGIN OF FAIRY AND ELF FOLK TALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As scientists grapple with the mysteries of Williams syndrome, UC Irvine 
professor Howard Lenhoff can't help but wonder if past generations turned to 
folklore to explain the presence of people among them with the distinctive 
traits that accompany the birth disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems logical to me, and to others, that the legends we hear about 
music-loving, kind-hearted fairies and elves might be the way people used to 
talk about Williams," the biologist said. "There are plenty of examples in 
history of people creating superstition or fantastic stories to explain medical 
conditions they couldn't understand, so it doesn't seem too unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenhoff has drafted an article, which he hopes to have published in a 
scientific journal, citing literary and historical references that could be 
related to Williams syndrome. Among his findings and theories: 
</P>
<P>
 * The facial traits of people with Williams syndrome is most often described 
as "pixie-like," with small, upturned noses, almond-shaped eyes, oval ears and 
broad mouths with full lips accented by a small chin. The syndrome is also 
accompanied by slow growth and development, giving people with WS a small 
stature. "It seems clear that they mirror the classic description of pixies and 
elves, and may be where it originated from," Lenhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fairies, elves and leprechauns are, according to lore, kind-hearted but 
sensitive beings. That fits the description of people with Williams, who are 
noted for the effusive personalities and insatiable love of conversation and 
interaction. "Fairies were said to become mischievous when ridiculed, and that 
fits with Williams too, because childlike sensitivity to criticism and being 
mocked that lasts throughout adulthood for many" people with Williams, Lenhoff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The "wee, magical people" of assorted folklore sources always seem to be 
associated with music and storytelling, Lenhoff points out. That trait fits 
nicely into the description of people with Williams, who have a strong command 
of vocabulary, surprisingly vivid narrative skills and, in many cases, musical 
ability. GEOFF BOUCHER

FORFEITURE LAW LIMITS SEIZURES BY POLICE; DRUGS: MEASURE SIGNED BY GOV. WILSON 
WEAKENS THE RIGHTS OF NARCOTICS OFFICERS TO TAKE SUSPECTS' PROPERTY AND TURN IT 
INTO CRIME-FIGHTING CASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1989, Simi Valley narcotics detectives seized $2.5 million from a Colombian 
money launderer and spent it on new officers, computers and high-tech detective 
gear. They won praise for turning drug profits into crime-fighting cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard narcotics officers seized a whole city block and several bank accounts 
because one tenant was selling cocaine. But four years later they were forced 
to give nearly all of it back because the innocent property owners' attorney 
protested the unfair seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1992, Malibu rancher Donald Scott was shot to death in a fruitless 
drug raid on his property. Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury 
denounced the fatal raid as little more than a botched land-grab under the 
asset-forfeiture law. 
</P>
<P>
 As attitudes toward California's tough asset-forfeiture law changed, so did 
the law itself. 
</P>
<P>
 It expired at the end of last year after failing to muster enough support for 
renewal. And on Friday, a new, weaker law -- forged as a compromise between 
supporters and critics of the old law -- was signed by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the fat times for law enforcement appear to be over. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly five years, Ventura County's police agencies had used the drug 
asset-forfeiture law to hire more personnel and buy better gear with the 
millions in cash and property they seized from suspected dope dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the tough 1989 law authored by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) 
expired Dec. 31 amid statewide criticism, it all but cut off the windfall that 
had been fattening California's narcotics squads with seizures from the guilty 
and innocent alike. 
</P>
<P>
 In its place stood a weaker 1988 forfeiture law written by Assemblyman Gary 
Condit (D-Modesto), one that sharply limited such seizures and has left some 
forfeiture-fed programs starving for funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the 1988 law became the subject of legal squabbles over whether 
it remained in effect. The debate prompted Ventura County prosecutors to 
temporarily suspend the filing of seizure cases earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise bill signed Friday by Gov. Wilson ensures law enforcement has a 
way to seize drug profits, but includes protections for innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Condit law, the new law requires a criminal drug conviction for 
forfeiture. It also requires training and auditing for agencies involved and a 
pre-seizure hearing for each case. And it requires police to sell or dispose of 
seized property rather than use it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors had praised the now-defunct Katz law as an effective, 
far-reaching weapon because no criminal conviction was needed to seize dealers' 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 By taking away houses, cars and bank accounts, officers said they could shut 
down drug rings -- even when they could not muster enough evidence to prove the 
dealer's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the biggest Ventura County seizure to date, Simi Valley police used 
$2.5 million in cash they seized in 1989 from Colombian drug-money launderer 
Otoniel Urrego to buy a half-million-dollar computer system, enhance their DARE 
program and back countless undercover narcotics stings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Katz law was also criticized for letting police abuse their power by 
taking cash and property from innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Oxnard police seized an entire block of businesses and $270,000 in 
business accounts because one business tenant was convicted of possessing 
cocaine for sale. It took four years for the innocent owners to reach an 
agreement with prosecutors to pay a settlement and win back their property and 
their legitimately earned money, said their lawyer, David Patrick Callahan. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the notorious drug raid on Donald P. Scott's Ventura County ranch near 
Malibu, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies thought marijuana was being grown 
there and wanted to seize the property, concluded Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury determined the Los Angeles County deputy shot the gun-wielding Scott 
in self-defense, but criticized the Los Angeles sheriff's motives in the case, 
saying the department was hungry for the 200-acre ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 George Eskin, a veteran Ventura County defense lawyer and former prosecutor, 
said: "My problem with the law and with what was occurring before the old law 
died is that it invited law enforcement misbehavior. There was an incentive to 
do a variety of things that were improper. . . . It turned them into bounty 
hunters." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The federal asset forfeiture law is even tougher than the Katz law. 
</P>
<P>
 It allows agents to seize any property where there is merely probable cause of 
drug involvement, while the Katz law set minimum amounts of drugs to qualify 
property for seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal forfeiture is pursued mostly in high-profile cases where the 
alleged drug crime violates federal law, leaving the vast majority of cases in 
California to state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, law enforcement officials say, Ventura County's drug dealers have 
grown steadily more careful. 
</P>
<P>
 More are selling drugs out of rented cars and apartments rather than their own 
expensive sports cars and lavish homes. And more are piping their profits into 
offshore bank accounts, making the drug money harder to track and seize. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a significant drop-off there, and it's my impression from what 
I'm hearing and what I see that we're not getting the big cases anymore," Chief 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin McGee said. "The big cases are falling under federal 
law." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet federal seizure cases cracked by state and local narcotics officers have 
not increased noticeably, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Eric Honig, chief of the 
Los Angeles asset forfeiture section. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We let (state and county prosecutors) know right from the beginning we would 
not accept any cases that would circumvent the intent of the state law," Honig 
said. "If there's a violation of state law, there has to be a concurrent 
violation of federal law for us to take the case. . . . Generally, the minimum 
case we have involving currency is $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
 And at a local level, the numbers paint a picture of dramatically shrinking 
seizures since the Katz law expired. 
</P>
<P>
 From January to June in 1992, the Ventura County district attorney's office 
processed 74 seizure cases with a total value of $265,000. In the same period 
this year, there were only 20 such cases filed, with a value of $70,000, McGee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a police department such as Simi Valley's, the falloff in drug money 
seizures could mean a dramatic cutback in certain services -- or an increasing 
need to dip into the city's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug money has enriched the Simi Valley department to the tune of more than $6 
million in the past 10 years, allowing it to buy a new radio system, 
surveillance gear and a computer-aided dispatch system worth more than half a 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 This fiscal year, Simi Valley is paying the salaries of 10 employees, 
including five detectives and a records clerk, plus officers for DARE, 
anti-gang and in-school programs, using a special budget of $855,100 made up 
entirely of seized drug profits. The fund also is paying a hefty cellular phone 
bill for its narcotics detectives, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the department's asset-forfeiture bank account, bolstered heavily by the 
$2.5-million seizure of Colombian drug money in 1989, is close to running dry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Police Chief Willard R. Schlieter said he is weighing ways to 
rework the budget and save the extra officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really in kind of a vital position," he said recently. "The 
assignments they're working right now provide some depth to our program. It's 
going to be a challenge to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard narcotics officers have also seen their asset-forfeiture money dwindle 
by as much as 30% this year from last year's take of about $80,000, said 
Assistant Chief Tom Cady. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has been spending the money on bulletproof vests, wireless body 
microphones and even a voice mail system for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intent of the law is for it to be used to enhance law enforcement's 
ability in particular to respond to narcotics problems," Cady said. "And as the 
funding sources get less and less . . . there's a concern that you could end up 
supplanting (seizure money) with general fund money." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Department narcotics deputies also report a dramatic 
drop in seizure cases, said Detective Michael Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, sheriff's deputies' income from seized property was $94,000, 
including 28 cars, in 28 separate cases, he said. In 1993, it had fallen to 
$68,000, with 26 cars in 32 cases. So far this year, deputies have seized 
property worth only $8,000, including four cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff cutbacks have contributed to the reduction, he said. But seizures also 
have fallen because of the expiration of the Katz law on New Year's Eve and the 
increasing shrewdness of drug dealers, who sell out of apartments and rented 
cars more often now rather than risk having their own homes and vehicles 
seized. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are starting -- and this is the trend -- to get educated about what 
they use in these cases," Leslie added.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, state and federal seizure laws still provide some windfall to 
departments, particularly from the big, interagency cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department, for instance, hopes to reap $2 million under the 
federal seizure law from a three-year, interstate undercover investigation into 
the Colombian Cali cocaine cartel that seized nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine 
and $5.8 million in cash -- $1 million of it taken in Thousand Oaks, said Sgt. 
Gary Pentis. 
</P>
<P>
 And Oxnard, Ventura and Ventura County departments are hoping to share a chunk 
of $438,000 that was seized April 15 in a cocaine ring investigation with 
Inglewood police, said Oxnard Police Sgt. Mike Matlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the expiration of the Katz law has pleased some in the Ventura 
County criminal defense bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Eskin argued that the old law unjustly took assets from some 
who were never convicted -- and that it dropped an especially large hammer on 
some innocent suspects who could not afford to fight the seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a majority of the public feels that law enforcement should not have 
the power to seize property in the absence of being able to establish the 
person's guilt," Eskin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled one client who had all $458 of his just-cashed paycheck seized 
when police found marijuana residue in the ashtray of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean that there weren't also some legitimate cases that we would 
applaud -- I have no sympathy with a major drug dealer who loses his yacht or 
airplane to law enforcement," Eskin said. "But I'm concerned about the little 
guys. . . . The government should not be coming around and taking property 
without due process." 
</P>
<P>
 And defense attorney David Callahan said the law was so tough that most 
seizures were "just like taking candy from a baby."  
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea of the forfeiture statute was to get these kingpins who make 
hundreds of thousands of dollars and put the money into palatial estates, 
speedboats and other trappings of leisure, and teach them that crime doesn't 
pay," Callahan said.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he said, most Katz law cases involved low-income people arrested for 
selling drugs to support a habit, who wound up losing their only cars and 
houses, leaving their families homeless and destitute. 
</P>
<P>
 But law enforcement officials argue that unless the law is strengthened again, 
the extra support narcotics investigations and other forfeiture-funded programs 
may continue to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they run out of money, there's one group that's going to suffer, and 
that's the public," said Sheriff's Cmdr. William Wade, whose major crimes unit 
oversees drug seizures and has in the past paid narcotics detectives with 
asset-forfeiture money. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an avenue where the crooks are contributing to the enforcement 
action," he said. "And by losing the forfeiture money, the agencies are either 
going to have to draw funds from the general fund . . . or they're going to 
have to reduce their activity. Either way, the public loses."

SIMI SEEKS TO RAISE HOTEL BED TAX TO 10% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After offering overnight guests the lowest surcharge in the county for years, 
Simi Valley wants to increase its tax on hotel beds from 8% to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council plans to hold a public hearing Monday night on its proposal 
to jack up the tax, which promises to net $75,000 to $100,000 more per year for 
city coffers from the four hotels in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate should be raised now not to earn extra money for the general fund, 
but to lessen the shock if it has to be raised again in a few years, said 
Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Ventura County cities already charge bed taxes of 10% -- including 
Ventura, Ojai, Thousand Oaks and Oxnard -- while Camarillo charges 9%, 
according to the staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 If the others go to 12% bed taxes, for instance, Simi Valley would some day 
have to raise its bed tax rate from 8% to 12% -- an increase of 50%, Sedell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council doesn't like to take long periods of time between reviews of 
revenue streams," Sedell said. "This keeps us in line without creating too much 
of a dent to the individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad idea, said Pat Fitch, manager of the Motel 6 in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will hurt our business quite a bit, in that most people who come 
to Motel 6 are looking for a clean budget room, and they think our price is a 
little high as it is," Fitch said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A room for a single adult there costs $35.99, plus a $2.88 bed tax under Simi 
Valley's current 8% rate. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposed 10% tax on that room charge would be about $3.60, bringing 
the total to nearly $40, Fitch pointed out. Some customers would likely go to 
the Motel 6 in Thousand Oaks instead, she said, where a room costs $29.99 plus 
a 10% bed tax of about $3. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Simi Valley Motel 6's customers these days are construction 
workers staying in town to repair local earthquake damage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Construction) companies are always looking to save a dollar here and there," 
she said. "Who knows, until it happens, what people will do?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the Simi Valley TraveLodge, $49-$55 rooms for single adults carry a bed tax 
of $3.92 to $4.40, but under the new proposal the tax could be raised to 
between $4.90 and $5.50. 
</P>
<P>
 George Peace, assistant general manager of the TraveLodge, predicted the tax 
increase might hurt business, as high bed taxes have in some major cities. In 
New York City, taxes were cut recently from nearly 20% to 13.25%, plus $2, 
while Los Angeles charges bed taxes of 14%. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Clarion Hotel in Simi Valley declined to comment on the 
proposed tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
 However, George Thingili, general manager of the Radisson Hotel in Simi 
Valley, said he has never heard customers complaining about the bed tax. 
</P>
<P>
 A room for a single adult there costs $99, or $89 for corporate customers, 
plus the 8% hotel tax.  
</P>
<P>
 Thingili said of the increase, "If it goes to promote the city and tourism, 
I'm all for that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sedell, the assistant city manager, said the bed tax revenues go into the 
general fund, where they help subsidize police, information and emergency 
services for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing on the proposed bed tax increase is scheduled as part of 
the City Council's regular meeting, which starts at 6:30 p.m. Monday at City 
Hall, 2929 Tapo Canyon Road.

MOORPARK CAUGHT IN A TRAFFIC JAM; ROADS: SURFACE STREET CONGESTION IS UP MORE 
THAN 30% SINCE COMPLETION OF FREEWAY CONNECTOR LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Debbie Rodgers-Teasley does not need a traffic study to tell her that the 
number of cars and trucks running through Moorpark has surged in the last year. 
She just has to look out her office window. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's constant," said Rodgers-Teasley, a real estate agent and president of 
the Moorpark Chamber of Commerce. "On any given day at any given time, you'll 
find a line of trucks heading down (California) 118 through Moorpark. If you 
don't see them, you feel them roaring by." 
</P>
<P>
 She's not the only one to notice the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Caltrans completed the Simi Valley-Moorpark freeway connector last year, 
traffic on Moorpark's surface streets has increased by more than 30%, said 
Sheriff's Sgt. Ed Tumbleson of the Moorpark station. The biggest jump is in the 
number of trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys show that traffic is up more than 10,000 cars and trucks a day on 
stretches of California 118 in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 survey by Larry Hail, a civil engineer working for a developer, counted 
an average of 27,000 vehicles a day along the highway between Moorpark Avenue 
and Spring Road. Another Hail survey in January showed an average of about 
37,000 vehicles a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Local residents had hoped that the new connector would bring some relief from 
the constant drone of big rigs driving through town. County transportation 
officials had predicted relief.  
</P>
<P>
 When the 2.2-mile freeway connector was completed, California 118 was also 
straightened through Moorpark, making it much easier and quicker to travel to 
Ventura or Oxnard.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now many drivers from Simi Valley take that route as an alternate to driving 
to Thousand Oaks and down the Conejo Grade. Truckers especially take advantage 
of the route because it avoids mandatory inspection stations at the top of the 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had a problem with truckers trying to sneak by the inspection 
station at the Conejo Grade," Tumbleson said. "The difference now is that the 
(bypass) route is even easier, and truckers are telling each other that this is 
the way to go to avoid hassles." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tumbleson said the increase has not caused an increase in accidents, 
he said he sees potential for problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In random truck inspections by the California Highway Patrol outside of 
Moorpark, officers found that more than 60% of the big rigs had serious safety 
violations, Tumbleson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you add the amount of traffic, plus the high rate of speed, plus the 
conditions of some of these trucks, all mixed in the middle of a town, there's 
going to be trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city has pushed state legislation that would allow sheriff's deputies to 
operate inspection stations outside of town to reduce traffic and improve 
safety. But so far nothing has come from the effort. Deputies can now stop 
trucks only for traffic violations in town. Only then are they allowed to make 
safety inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP has said that it is spread too thin to do more inspections. Eleven 
officers now cover the Conejo Grade inspection station and random safety 
inspections on California 118 and California 126. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we ever got the people to put out there on a regular basis, we would do 
it," said Lt. Bill Inglis of the CHP's Conejo Inspection Station. "I don't want 
to indict all the truckers that use the 118, but we know a lot use the route to 
bypass the scales. We're all concerned about that." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of truckers use the route because it is quick and convenient, said 
trucker Amos Almeida of S & P Milling Co. in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the boys from out of the area know about the 118 as a straight shot 
to Ventura or Oxnard from the Valley," he said. "But gosh, it is dangerous. You 
got a two-lane road and a lot of impatient cars wanting to pass you. I know 
some drivers are using the route to avoid the scales, but I would say there 
aren't that many of them doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders say that reducing traffic on the 118 is one of their top 
priorities, but they offer few solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Paul Lawrason said there are benefits to having so many vehicles 
traveling through town. Fast-food restaurants and shops catering to motorists 
have helped the city increase its sales tax by nearly 10%, Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Traffic has been a perennial problem, but it is not all bad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Moorpark has thrived with heavy traffic for much longer than most people 
know. According to the Ventura County Almanac, 672 cars passed through town in 
a single hour one July day in 1923.  
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose that is just a graphic illustration of how we've always been a hub 
for Ventura County," Councilman Scott Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said plans to complete a freeway that would completely bypass 
Moorpark's surface streets are being laid out by Caltrans, but construction is 
decades away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we'll see that in my lifetime," he said.

COMMUNITY ROCKED BY SCHOOL SEX SCANDALS; VENTURA: PARENTS, TEACHERS AND 
OFFICIALS STRUGGLE TO COPE AS A THIRD COACH FACES ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL 
MISCONDUCT WITH STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In the small, concrete-floored coaches' office at the Ventura High School 
field house, photos of the school's black-and-gold uniformed football teams 
line one wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura High School Cougars -- Channel League Champions," the inscription for 
each photo reads, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, 1990, 1991, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the center row in each portrait, except the most recent, is former 
head coach Harvey W. Kochel. Near him, in all but the two earliest photos, is 
assistant coach Bret Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Kochel was fired two years ago and later went to prison for having sex with a 
15-year-old student. Taylor was put on leave without pay last month and faces 
possible dismissal on similar allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 And in between the Kochel and Taylor cases, another member of the school's 
athletic department -- swim coach Dale Hahn -- surrendered his California 
teaching credential on allegations that he had sex with two students. 
</P>
<P>
 What is going on at Ventura High? 
</P>
<P>
 With three coaches accused of sexual misconduct in the past two years, 
parents, students and Ventura school officials are struggling to come to grips 
with the series of scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kochel case brought loads of notoriety and heaps of community criticism on 
the Ventura Unified School District. Critics charge that school officials knew 
for years about Kochel's behavior but did nothing about it.  
</P>
<P>
 Then the coach was put behind bars and the uproar died down. Less than a year 
after Kochel went to prison, Hahn was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 To help boost the school's battered image, Supt. Joseph Spirito shook up 
Ventura High's administration, naming a new principal and three new assistant 
principals, who took over July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The coming school year was supposed to provide a fresh start. Then the Taylor 
case broke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely couldn't believe that it could happen so soon, so quick, so much 
the same," said Vickie Nicoletto, whose daughter, Tammie, will be a sophomore 
at Ventura High this fall. "It's appalling." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say it is unusual for three teachers from one school to face 
allegations of sexual misconduct within such a short period, but only because 
many are not caught. Improper behavior by teachers is widespread, they say. 
Many Ventura High parents and students say they don't believe that such 
incidents are limited to their school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry," said Sandy Rasmussen, who has two daughters at the high school. 
"I just don't believe that every person who could be a pervert and hit on girls 
is teaching at Ventura High School." 
</P>
<P>
 Some wonder whether Kochel may have created a climate that condoned coaches 
fooling around with students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because he was the head coach, he made it seem OK," said Linda Hale, a 
volunteer in the Ventura High School office, whose son will be a senior this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet others question whether the district is becoming overzealous in its stated 
"zero-tolerance" approach to sexual misconduct, with investigations of teachers 
turning into witch hunts. 
</P>
<P>
 And still others say students who get involved with teachers must bear part of 
the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Sgt. Bob Anderson said detectives who interviewed students 
during the investigations of Hahn and Taylor were surprised that some girls 
admitted pursuing young, good-looking teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're handsome hunks, they're fair game," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the allegations against the three coaches each brought a similar sense 
of anguish to the school community, many people are quick to point out the 
differences in the three cases. 
</P>
<P>
 A hugely successful coach whose persona has been compared to that of former 
Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka, Kochel led the Ventura High Cougars to win or 
share league titles in six out of nine years from 1983 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 His career ended abruptly in September, 1992, when the parents of a female 
student handed school officials more than 50 sexually explicit letters that 
Kochel had written to their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors portrayed Kochel as the seducer, saying his early letters were 
written to coax the girl into having sex, while the later ones encouraged her 
to become more sexually aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 And past complaints about his behavior emerged, including a letter that was 
sent to school officials in 1987 from a person who reported seeing a student 
having oral sex with Kochel in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with community criticism and a lawsuit by the 15-year-old's parents, 
school officials defended themselves, saying they had repeatedly warned Kochel 
to change his ways. Officials said that before they got the letters they didn't 
have the witnesses or evidence necessary to discipline the popular coach. 
Kochel served a year in prison and was released early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1993, about 11 months after Kochel was sentenced, the district 
suspended Hahn on similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
 A coach of the swim and water polo teams and a chemistry teacher, Hahn was 
accused of sleeping with two female students and making advances toward others. 
Although Hahn was never the subject of criminal charges, he agreed in June to 
give up his teaching credential in exchange for one year's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both Kochel and Hahn have had their share of supporters. But Taylor is drawing 
more sympathy and less condemnation from some parents. For one thing, he is 
closer in age to the students he is accused of dating. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn was 44 when the district took action against him. Kochel was 48. Taylor 
is now 28 and was just out of college when he began substitute teaching at 
Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Taylor has for the past two years taught history at Balboa Middle 
School and only went to Ventura High after school to coach baseball and 
football. However, many of the allegations against him stem from incidents that 
reportedly occurred while he was substitute teaching at Ventura High during the 
1990-91 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hahn, Taylor faces no criminal charges. The most egregious allegations 
against him -- that he had sex with two girls -- are based on secondhand 
reports, according to a legal statement filed by the district with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor has verified some allegations, according to the report, including that 
he kissed one student when he gave her a ride in his car and kissed another 
while she was at his home working on a history report. 
</P>
<P>
 And district officials say these incidents are serious enough to take the 
matter before an administrative panel to decide whether Taylor should be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 But some officials, parents and students say this time the district is going 
too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand how Harvey could let himself do what he did," said head 
football coach Phil McKune, who was an assistant coach under Kochel. "I don't 
understand how Dale could do what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But McKune said he believes Taylor when he says his worst transgression was 
kissing a student. "He made a mistake and he knows he made a mistake," McKune 
said. "But it's not a career-ending mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are getting real touchy," said Paula Ward, vice president of the 
Ventura High Parent-Teacher Assn. "Because (Taylor) is the third one in a line, 
everybody's fuse is real short and quick to jump." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's daughter, Amy, and some other students and parents said they believe 
the girls who got involved with Taylor shoulder some responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls ought to know not to go out with teachers," Amy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those girls wear tank tops that show almost everything," said Erik Olson, the 
17-year-old star quarterback of the Ventura High Cougars. "They think it's cool 
to go out with a guy over 20." 
</P>
<P>
 As parent Sandy Rasmussen put it: "I don't think we can dump this all on the 
adults and say, 'This is all your fault.' Teen-agers have brains." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tammie Nicoletto, who will be a sophomore this year, said she believes 
some girls are egged on by teachers who are flirtatious.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have a job," Tammie said. "They should keep to their job and nothing 
else. If they want to pick up on younger girls, they should do it somewhere 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Supt. Spirito: "We've all had infatuations as students with our 
teachers. They see a teacher they like and say, 'Isn't he nice looking.' The 
difference is the teacher has to make a strong decision that you don't cross 
the line." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jo McGrath, the attorney hired by the district to investigate the Hahn 
and Taylor cases, agreed that students can be aggressive. "The girls can 
actually be brutal, relentless, just flirt, flirt, flirt," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But research shows that high school students do not realize the ramifications 
of becoming involved with an older person, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 An expert on sexual misconduct by teachers, McGrath said she has investigated 
about 200 such cases in California schools over the past 18 years. Only a small 
number of the schools have had as many as three teachers who faced such 
allegations.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the 200 cases, McGrath said more than half have been against athletic 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Like drama and music teachers, who also are often targets of such 
investigations, coaches have ample opportunities to be alone with students. 
</P>
<P>
 And in coaching, "historically there's a bit of a macho attitude and girls are 
fair game," McGrath said. She added that most coaches are innocent of sexual 
misconduct and maintain a professional relationship with students. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ventura High, new Principal Hank Robertson said he does not believe there 
has been a pattern of such abuse by coaches or teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, some parents and officials say they believe Kochel may have been a 
bad role model for younger coaches such as Hahn and Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach McKune dismissed that theory as "garbage," but said in any event the 
district's message to teachers and coaches about dating students now is clear: 
It won't be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've seen what happened to Harvey," he said. "They've seen what happened 
to Dale." 
</P>
<P>
 And they see what is happening to Taylor. The hearing to determine whether 
Taylor will be fired begins Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Even people who fear the district may be going too far in disciplining Taylor 
say they welcome the district's iron-fisted approach to teachers accused of 
preying on students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're housecleaning," Ward said. "We're getting rid of that stuff. We're 
saying these teachers cannot do this to our students any longer. We're not 
going to accept it."

OXNARD, COUNTY SQUARE OFF OVER WATERWAY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard's thirst for growth has manifested itself many times since the city's 
birth at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 So it should have surprised no one when the cash-parched city turned to the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's proposal to annex the Channel Islands Harbor waterway, now a part of 
Ventura County -- pits Oxnard against the county in a tussle over less than 
$200,000 in property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard leaders say they are only claiming what is rightfully theirs: a 
Y-shaped waterway bordered entirely by the city, reachable solely by city 
roads, and which for years has benefited from city police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 County leaders say they seek only to protect a valuable investment they have 
always owned and operated: a small-craft marina that cost them $1 million to 
dig and $7 million to renovate. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor John K. Flynn, whose district includes the harbor, has 
slammed Oxnard's plan, calling it an act of gluttony and betrayal. The city has 
done little to maintain the marina, he said, yet has profited greatly from it 
-- taking in about $600,000 a year in bed and sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn has vowed to stop Oxnard's power ploy, and has countered with a 
stratagem of his own: a proposal to de-annex the land surrounding the waterway, 
which is within the city's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "A parasite never kills the host," Flynn said. "Oxnard, the parasite, is doing 
several things to try and kill the host, in this case the county. But it won't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tom Holden defended the city's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't about county versus the city," Holden said. "I would hope that 
we'd look at what is best for people who use the harbor. John Flynn is supposed 
to represent the people of Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1965, Channel Islands Harbor covers more than 300 acres of land and 
water. The county leases most of the surrounding land to developers, who have 
built restaurants, condominiums and about 3,600 boat slips. 
</P>
<P>
 Leases and taxes at the marina generate about $2 million for the county each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Oxnard City Council decided to move forward with a 
plan to annex the harbor water. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders argue that the popular waterway is within the city's sphere of 
influence as approved by the Local Agency Formation Commission -- a state 
agency that deals with jurisdictional matters -- and is therefore their oyster. 
</P>
<P>
 But LAFCO still has to approve the annexation, and a heated political showdown 
between Oxnard and the county is widely expected at an upcoming LAFCO meeting, 
probably in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn, who is chairman of LAFCO, said he usually does not lobby against 
proposals that come before the LAFCO board, but may make an exception in the 
case of Oxnard's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know what the city is up to other than looking for revenues," he 
said. "The money generated by the harbor that's left over after the maintenance 
costs of the harbor goes to parks and into the (county's) general fund. We need 
those revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 Other LAFCO members include Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, Thousand Oaks Mayor 
Alex Fiore, Ojai City Councilman Robert McKinney, and Janis McCormick, a member 
of the public who holds no elected office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a potential inequity if the county has done all that work over the 
years to keep that harbor up, and then the city takes it over and profits from 
it," McKinney said. "That would be something I would be looking at. But I don't 
know if that is LAFCO's responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps anticipating a clash, Oxnard has enlisted consultant Bob Braitman, who 
served as LAFCO's executive director from 1974 to 1991, to prepare the city's 
annexation application and steer the plan through. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn charged that the hiring of Braitman -- who drafted the current 
boundaries surrounding the harbor -- constitutes a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public is concerned about these kind of relationships," Flynn said. "It 
would be like me quitting my job and bringing county projects before the 
Planning Commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Braitman, in turn, has accused Flynn of bias, questioning his ability to serve 
on the board. He cited a comment by Flynn that the annexation would happen 
"over my dead body." 
</P>
<P>
 "If a member of a board that is supposed to make a decision only after a 
public hearing says beforehand that only 'over his dead body' will the 
annexation happen, should he be allowed to sit on that board?" Braitman asked. 
"His mind is made up." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have criticized Braitman's deal with the city, which would pay him 10% 
of the city's first-year revenues from the waterway -- or about $10,000 -- if 
the annexation takes place, but would only cover his expenses if it fails. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who would have ever thought that Bob Braitman, the ultimate bureaucrat, would 
be working as a bounty hunter for the city of Oxnard?" said Gerard Kapuscik, 
general manager of the Channel Islands Beach Community Services District, after 
a recent Oxnard council meeting. "I have never heard of an agreement like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Beach district officials contend that a different kind of water -- drinking 
water -- may be the true motive behind the annexation. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which includes the harbor water, Silver Strand, 
Hollywood-by-the-Sea and Hollywood beaches, provides potable water to the 
harbor. It has invested between $2 million and $3 million in pipes and 
infrastructure, and takes in about $500,000 a year from the service, Kapuscik 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard, Kapuscik said, may be looking to take over those services -- a move 
that could bring the annual water revenues to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach district officials say they will not give up the profitable waterway 
without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city needs to understand that the district is going to seek recompense 
for that money," Kapuscik said. "It is not just going to sit and let this 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 District leaders, who still have unsettling memories of attempts by Oxnard to 
annex their community in the late 1970s, say they are also worried that the 
plan is the beginning of another scheme by the city to take them over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their attitude is ugly," said Patrick Forrest, one of the district's five 
directors. "They think that because they are bigger than us that they can bully 
us. We're small, but we're very patriotic, and we know we don't have anything 
to gain by joining Oxnard. What would we get from joining them other than their 
debt?" 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Anderson, Channel Islands harbor master for the past 25 years, said if 
Oxnard's plan becomes reality, the city would then shoulder the burden of 
dredging and maintaining the waterway -- a toilsome task that costs the county 
about $500,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Oxnard would only receive about $100,000 a year from the harbor -- 20% 
of the property tax revenue collected from boats in the marina -- the plan 
intended in part to boost city revenues would end up costing the city money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if the city has really looked at those responsibilities, which 
are not only significant but quite costly," Anderson said. "But I haven't heard 
anything that leads me to believe that the city has a plan to take over the 
maintenance of the harbor." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard leaders say they have not formulated a plan to keep up the harbor water 
simply because they do not think it will be their duty. Proposed Water 
Annexation 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard is attempting to annex the water area of the Channel Islands Harbor, 
currently an unincorporated part of Ventura County. Oxnard leaders say their 
plan is intended to reduce confusion over police and fire services in the area. 
Critics contend money is the motive.

 A Canoga Park man who operated a local convenience store was stabbed to death 
in Port Hueneme late Friday during a botched robbery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohineer Bassi, 42, was stabbed several times in the chest and stomach at the 
B-Mart on East Pleasant Valley Road about 9:30 p.m. Friday, a Port Hueneme 
Police Department spokeswoman said.Bassi, described by a neighboring merchant 
as an employee of B-Mart, staggered next door to the Jester Room Bar, where an 
ambulance was called, the spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bassi was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, where he died 
in surgery, a Ventura County coroner's office spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following leads gathered at the scene, Port Hueneme homicide detectives 
arrested Adolfo Carrillo, 32, of Port Hueneme early Saturday on suspicion of 
killing Bassi, the police spokeswoman said. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; RIP CURRENTS POSE RISK TO BEACH-GOERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rip currents in Ventura waters have resulted in 10 near drownings in the last 
six days, a head lifeguard at the San Buenaventura State Beach said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight people in two separate incidents Saturday afternoon were swept into the 
ocean by rip currents along the unguarded beach south of the Ventura Harbor 
near Surfers Knoll, said Kirk Sturm a lifeguard supervisor with the State 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "That beach is known to have rip currents all the time," he said. "People have 
to realize that on these beaches with no lifeguards they shouldn't enter the 
water. It can be dangerous any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven people were swept into the ocean about 3 p.m. Saturday, Sturm said. Five 
lifeguards, one park ranger and one member of the Ventura Harbor Patrol had to 
swim out to pull the beach-goers from the water, he said. No one was seriously 
hurt in the incident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturm said lifeguards Keith Mullaney, 24, and Rachel Thompson, 21, sprinted 
half a mile from Marina Cove Beach and were the first rescuers in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they deserve some kind of medal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 5,000 people crowded area beaches Saturday, with close to half of 
those on the unguarded beaches north of the Ventura Pier and south of the 
Ventura Harbor, Sturm said. More are expected today. SCOTT HADLY

 A birthday party brawl that broke out early Saturday morning in the 200 block 
of Bard Lane just outside the Ventura city limits left two young men in 
critical condition and three others slightly injured, a Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight started about 1 a.m. after youths from the Ventura Avenue area 
crashed the party, the spokesman said.Police estimate that more than 50 youths 
at the scene participated in the fight using bricks, clubs and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerardo Hernandez, 18, of Ventura and Luis Rodriguez, 15, of Oxnard were 
listed in critical condition with head injuries at Ventura County Medical 
Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. Juan Rodriguez, 19; Oscar Ponce, 23, and 
Ricardo Vasquez, 18, all of Oxnard, were treated for minor injuries and 
released, the spokeswoman said.

BRENTWOOD'S NEW TRENDINESS MAKES MANY LEERY; HOT SPOT: A STRIP OF 300 UPSCALE 
SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS ATTRACTS THRONGS OF PEOPLE, BUT LONGTIME RESIDENTS AND 
MERCHANTS FEAR LOSS OF SMALL-TOWN ATMOSPHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simpson saga may have put Brentwood on national maps overnight, but the 
neighborhood had become a destination point for locals long before the media 
blitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that local attention has centered on the San Vicente Boulevard strip, 
a half-mile stretch from Bundy Drive to Wilshire Boulevard lined with about 300 
upscale shops and restaurants that have made the area one of the Westside's 
most desirable social enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 With its leafy coral trees dotting a grassy median, where years ago red street 
cars ran from Brentwood down to the ocean, business people have been drawn to a 
small-town atmosphere not easy to find in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially known as the San Vicente Scenic Corridor, it has managed to thrive, 
mainly due to its array of restaurants, while neighboring Westwood Village, a 
trendy shopping and movie theater district that once drew throngs on weekend 
nights, has struggled in recent years -- the victim, some say, of its own 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are trying to recapture the magic that Westwood once had," said Jack 
Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles 
County. "They're looking for warm and fuzzy areas, and they seem to have found 
it in Brentwood." 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents say San Vicente has become one of the top locations for 
retail and office projects on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has the highest demand and the lowest vacancy rates," said David Thind, a 
Brentwood-based broker who handles real estate across the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Business people are drawn to an area in large part due to its reputation for 
low-crime and high life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case notwithstanding, Brentwood has one of the lowest crime rates 
in the city, said Los Angeles Police Capt. Connie Dial, who heads patrols in 
the West Los Angeles area. The area also includes some of the city's wealthiest 
residents, who live in some of the region's priciest homes. Real estate brokers 
say the average price for single-family homes on the market is $1.4 million, 
with the average condo going for $280,950. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants have gained the most from San Vicente's recent growth, with 
50-minute waits for tables at most establishments on typical evenings. 
Restaurants account for about 10% of the commercial space on the strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, while restaurants offering haute and lean cuisine have flourished, the 
smaller mom-and-pop businesses that lent the area a hometown feel have not been 
as successful of late. The recession has left an abundance of homes for sale on 
the shady side streets leading from the boulevard, meaning fewer residents for 
the businesses that cater to such traffic. In addition, the arrival of large 
chain stores has compounded trouble for some smaller shopkeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Arian Moini, pharmacist at Westside Pharmacy since 1982, said the neighborhood 
drugstore has been struggling for business since a Long's Drugs store moved in 
last year, less than half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can blame it on the recession or on Long's, but I think it's got to do 
with a lot of people moving out of the neighborhood," Moini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, other pedestrian traffic has surged since Nicole Brown Simpson, 
former wife of O.J. Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman were found 
murdered June 13 on the steps of her South Bundy Drive condo not far from the 
strip. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the curiosity has centered on Mezzaluna, the San Vicente Boulevard 
restaurant where Goldman worked as a waiter and where Nicole Simpson dined the 
night before they both were killed. It now bulges with customers every night of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Other establishments have experienced an uptick as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of tourists driving around," said Dale Greenblatt, general 
manager of Gratis, one of the area's newest restaurants. "The minute (O.J. 
Simpson) was caught, people showed up and the crowds picked up." 
</P>
<P>
 San Vicente's look, generally storefronts with conservative lettering and 
lighting with some sidewalk dining, is owed to two vigilant groups that guard 
against gaudy signs and other garish architectural features. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a street where a McDonald's would fit. 
</P>
<P>
 The two groups, the Design Review Board, whose members are chosen by Los 
Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, a Brentwood resident, and the Brentwood 
Homeowners Assn., make recommendations to the city Planning Department on 
prospective San Vicente businesses. The advice is usually heeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Together they have prevented tacky signs, unsightly buildings and other 
eyesores from cropping up on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Low density, beauty and substantial public benefit, that's what I'm concerned 
about," Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
 After 29 years in office, Braude's influence is apparent. San Vicente 
merchants recall how he helped persuade his City Council colleagues in 1992 to 
exempt Brentwood from an ordinance that created mandatory no-parking tow-away 
zones during the evening rush hour along most of the area's most heavily 
traveled streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners complained that the no-parking ordinance was forcing customers 
away, and now the strip is one of the only streets in the city where the 
tow-away zones are not in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Every aesthetic aspect of San Vicente, from shrub heights to parking 
requirements, is detailed in a design plan that is largely Braude's handiwork. 
In the early 1980s, he appointed the Design Review Board, the city's first, to 
ensure that new businesses would comply with the plan's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven board members evaluate proposals from prospective San Vicente 
businesses with this mission: to promote pedestrian traffic along San Vicente 
and "to keep the look of San Vicente from going in another direction," said 
Braude aide Daniel Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Angelenos may be touched by the San Vicente strip's hometown appeal, 
longtime residents reminisce about the days when it had an even more profound 
community spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds, it seems, have been a mixed blessing. While it has meant profits 
for some upscale businesses, it has also diminished the Main Street aura, some 
say, and has lead to parking problems that could threaten its success. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Vicente isn't the village that it was," said Jules Lamm, an optometrist 
who has had his practice on San Vicente for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 There were always restaurants and shops on the strip, Lamm said, but San 
Vicente has never been as crowded as it is today. And chain stores and other 
new arrivals have ousted mom-and-pop shops in recent years: Gone are a popular 
hobby shop, shoe store and neighborhood eatery -- replaced by a gym, Music Plus 
record store and the Cheesecake Factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the businesses come. 
</P>
<P>
 "We explored other possible locations on the Westside -- Marina del Rey, 
Beverly Hills, Sepulveda (Boulevard) and Santa Monica to name a few, but we 
really wanted to be here," said Jason McKinley, who owns Great Harvest Bread 
Co. with his wife, Gina. It opened in June. "There's a real sense of community. 
You don't get that much in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Linda Cadioty, senior vice president of the Cheesecake Factory, which 
opened an outlet in April, 1993: "We looked in Brentwood for a long time, but 
earlier we (were concerned) it was too close to our locations in Beverly Hills 
and Marina del Rey. Once those were established, we decided to open in 
Brentwood. It's such a small, sweet area." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of San Vicente's restaurateurs seem untouched by competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone seems to be doing just fine," said Gratis' Greenblatt. "There's 
enough people to go around." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been some restraint to the growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Limiting the number of restaurants that serve alcohol on the strip is a 
persistent and sometimes heated issue for Braude's office. The city does not 
specify the number of liquor licenses that can be issued on San Vicente, but 
Braude focuses on keeping the concerns of neighbors in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am well-known for my skeptical view of liquor licenses," Braude said. "If 
it is the type of place that just serves liquor, then I would be opposed to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Michael Harris, president of the Brentwood Homeowners Assn., which has 
lobbied against liquor licenses: "It would be difficult to open a bar. This has 
been an ongoing battle." 
</P>
<P>
 The city Planning Department recently denied conditional-use permits to two 
restaurants, Johnny Rockets and Taiki, that would have allowed them to sell 
alcohol. The department's staff report cited the high concentration of liquor 
licenses in the area as the reason for the rejections. The City Council will 
now review the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more divisive than the issue of liquor licenses is the area's parking 
problem: there are simply not enough spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday I saw two women get out of their cars and start beating each other 
up over a parking space," said Bucholtz, manager of the restaurant 
Koo-Koo-Roo's. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Brentwood residents recall that the parking problem was supposed to 
have been resolved by using revenue from meters along San Vicente to purchase 
off-street parking lots. But the city instead deposited the money into a 
general fund that it used for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is available, but we can't find appropriate space in that area," 
Braude said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one wants to predict how long San Vicente will be hot. Angelenos tend to be 
fickle when it comes to patronizing the latest place to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throw anything into the pond that makes it change, then you risk not having 
the crowd," said Stanley Kyker, executive vice president of the California 
Restaurant Assn. He cites Westwood as an example, noting that it seemed to lose 
its charm after being rocked by gang violence and crime several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "On San Vicente they'll have to work with other retailers to market the area, 
to continue making it attractive," Kyker said. "But the problem we have in 
Southern California is that an area becomes 'in' just because it's 'in.' 
Nothing lasts forever." 
</P>
<P>
 With Brentwood surrounded by some of the most attractive high-life restaurants 
and shops on the Westside, whose decor is strictly controlled by city groups, 
some are wary of losing the small-town atmosphere, as crowds flock to L.A.'s 
latest hot spot.

ANY AIRPORT GROWTH IS SIGNIFICANT TO NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Brian Bowman's Aug. 7 letter regarding the article "Airport's Neighbors 
Blast Expansion Plan" proves that as the president of the 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority he is more interested in toeing the 
correct political line than in listening to his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman stated that part of the primary area of public debate is whether "an 
increase (in aircraft noise) will be 'significant' as defined by state 
government." He went on to say "the analysis shows residential areas around the 
airport would not experience a 'significant' increase in noise exposure, as 
defined by federal and state standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Bowman cares only about the federal or state definitions of 
"significant," not his airport's neighbors' definition of the word. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who live around the airport (or even miles away under its landing 
patterns) know the noise is significant, whether the government defines it as 
such or not. Any more noise from additional planes will prevent the quiet 
enjoyment of our property, day and night, and destroy our property values. 
That's the primary area of public debate. We want justice, not definitions and 
decisions issued by people whose lives won't be affected other than by an 
increase in their paycheck or their prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 SUSAN ROBINS

</P>
<P>
 * The Yogi Berraesque letter by Brian B. Bowman, president of the 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority, (Aug. 7) continues the decades-old 
obfuscation by the noisemaker/rulers of our friendly neighborhood airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Bowman attempts to defend the "revised" environmental impact report that 
was ordered by the Superior Court of California after it ruled that the airport 
authority had not adequately addressed the noise impact of adjoining 
communities of the proposed expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there will be more planes and indeed more noise," says Mr. Bowman. That 
is exactly the point. The residents who live under the barrage of takeoffs 
don't want more planes and more noise. One more takeoff is "significant." Ten 
fewer operations per day would be significantly better. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 years ago when LAX had its major expansion, dozens of homes -- an 
entire neighborhood in Playa del Rey -- were condemned and removed to rescue 
these residents from a hellish fate. Such a buyout could not occur to the 
thousands of residents surrounding the Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that this airport was here 60 years ago does not preordain growth at 
the expense of the citizenry. This is particularly relevant with the 
authority's obstinate refusal to share the noise by easterly takeoffs over 
Burbank and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The only mitigation measure to more planes is fewer planes. Or try sharing the 
existing noise with your people, Mr. Bowman -- say for six months. Then let's 
see who really wants more noisy jets pounding our skis. This is the American 
way.

THE BEILENSON RECORD ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Verne Bauman (Letters, July 24) is seriously misinformed about my 
legislative accomplishments in the area of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mr. Bauman did concede that I have "introduced five good bills" to deal 
with illegal immigration -- and I might add that I have co-sponsored and 
supported many others -- he states that I am "politely waiting for them to die 
in the Judiciary Committee."Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact of the matter is that I am the leading and most vocal Democrat in the 
House of Representatives on the issue of illegal immigration and, as my 
colleagues will tell you, I have worked hard on that issue for many years now. 
Contrary to Mr. Bauman's statement, Congress has already acted on several of my 
proposals, and the others are in various stages of consideration.

LINK EDUCATION FUNDS TO PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * My opponent's approach to solving problems in poor areas ("Empowerment Zone 
Would Tap Pacoima's Community Spirit," Aug. 2) fails to demand enough 
accountability and fails to call for the teaching of values in our schools.  
</P>
<P>
 The large grants should be used to fund contracts awarded on the basis of 
tough competitive bids, not on the basis of quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 More money for education is a good idea. However, it should be tied to demands 
for better performance from administrators, teachers, and students alike. 
</P>
<P>
 More police on the street must be accompanied by teaching respect for our laws 
and by teaching the penalties for breaking them. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempts to create more jobs must be joined by the teaching that work has 
dignity -- even work at the lower end of the pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
 We must not repeat the mistakes of the past social programs that were 
well-intentioned failures.

VOTE FOR CANDIDATE WHO WELCOMES THE TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * John Schwada's Aug. 13 article on our congressional candidate's research of 
public records highlights an ironic situation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same week that Rich Sybert was releasing his records to the public, 
Tony Beilenson was voting to block the Freedom of Information Act from applying 
to offices of the legislative branch (the Congressional Accountability Act of 
1994, Aug. 9).Of course, on that same day Beilenson also voted to maintain the 
exemption of Congress from public laws (which apply to everyone else), and he 
voted to exempt Congress from any health care reform bill that is passed by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 And in refusing to debate until mid-October, Beilenson has stated "earlier 
debates would be pointless because voters won't focus on the election until the 
final weeks." But if we are so uninterested, how would Beilenson explain his 
barrage of franked mail pieces -- 203,000 taxpayer dollars' worth in the last 
12 months -- if he thinks we don't want to hear the real issues discussed? 
</P>
<P>
 This November, let's vote for someone willing to bring us the truth and 
someone able to refuse special treatment.

A COUPLE OF 'INFURIATING' DECISIONS BY POLITICOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a Sherman Oaks resident, I have recently read about some of the most 
infuriating political behavior I have ever encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 First the Department of Transportation had nine beautiful and towering trees 
on Dickens Street removed so a few more cars could drive by unimpeded.Of course 
the people who made that decision don't live there. What do they care? Take a 
look around you, politicos. A neighborhood is pretty and valuable in direct 
proportion to the greenery in it. It becomes run-down, crime-ridden, 
graffiti-splattered and worth less in all ways as a place to live as the 
asphalt and concrete increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we learned that the Department of Corrections spent $2 million to find a 
site for its parole office in Sherman Oaks. Wouldn't it have been smarter and 
fairer to have found out what communities the parolees were from and put the 
office in one of those cities? Two million dollars! Isn't that what real estate 
brokers routinely get paid commissions in the neighborhood of $5,000 to $10,000 
to find? That's a lottery payoff. I could have found a site for $1,000. 
Assemblyman Richard Katz of Panorama City says that's why the parole office 
should stay in Sherman Oaks -- otherwise, we'd waste that investment. It's 
already been wasted, Mr. Katz!

VOLUNTEERS CAN HELP ELDERLY QUAKE SURVIVORS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The anguished face of Francis Fariola in the photograph accompanying The 
Times' article "Elderly Struggle to Recover From Earthquake" (July 10) 
eloquently captures the fears of many older adults living alone and isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 For elderly survivors of the quake, there is the added trauma and worry of 
wondering if they will lose their homes, compounding rising feelings of 
isolation and helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Volunteer Center of Los Angeles, one of the 12 nonprofit 
organization members of the new Earthquake Response Volunteer Network, 10 
senior volunteers are being readied to meet the needs of elderly quake victims. 
</P>

 Already active in the Hollywood area aiding older adults' efforts to remain 
living independently, Senior Companions will expand service to clients referred 
by senior centers in West Hollywood, Inglewood and Central Los Angeles.

PROBATION IN QUAKE FRAUD A SLAP IN THE FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The sentence of probation given the woman for claiming she lived at the 
Northridge Meadows when she lived in Carson is but a slap on the hand. 
</P>
<P>
 It serves as a slap in the face of those of us who lost our homes and waited 
as much as four months for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 This woman was one of 30 people who made false claims that took time away from 
those truly needing assistance. Her insensitivity is despicable, and the fact 
she used an address with actual deaths is unforgivable.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps these scammers should be given a dose of what they falsely claimed 
they experienced. If they truly knew the horror of being left homeless for 
weeks without food or a place to shower, then they would know true punishment.

A SHORTCUT THAT LEADS TO TRAGEDY; SOME BLAME FOR DEATHS ON THE TRACKS RESTS 
WITH OUR PECULIARLY RECKLESS PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're an adult pedestrian who had foolishly decided to break trespass laws by 
crossing that Metrolink commuter train track with an engine hurtling toward you 
at 60 m.p.h. Perhaps your shoe is untied or your sandal is loose. You decide 
that it would be quite foolish if you caught a loose lace or strap on the 
track. You stop to tie it, and then proceed. The train is far down the tracks. 
You've got time. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, you don't. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four seconds or so that it takes, the train has traveled 352 feet -- 
the length of a football field, and nearly another 20 yards more. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, you're a school-age child who has watched adults jeopardize their lives 
in such fashion all summer long. You figure it's OK to do likewise, and you're 
headed to school with an armload of loose papers. You drop them as you approach 
the tracks, and papers are scattered everywhere. You scramble to retrieve them. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say you're quick and it takes just 30 seconds to gather your papers. In 
that span of time, the approaching train has covered half a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 If those scenarios seem implausible to you, then consider the remaining 
members of the Pina family in Glendale. Antonio Juan Pina, 79, his 37-year-old 
daughter and 7-year-old granddaughter thought they could make it across the 
tracks in time. All three are dead. They were the 19th, 20th and 21st 
fatalities to occur along Metrolink tracks since they opened in late 1992. Many 
of those deaths have occurred in the San Fernando Valley area; fewer than half 
are considered suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge quake, Metrolink trains cover much more ground. That 
simply means that Metrolink officials need to redouble their educational 
efforts and to consider more fencing and warning signals. 
</P>
<P>
 But a certain amount of blame rests with California's peculiarly reckless 
public, which last year recorded more than twice as many fatalities among 
bicyclists, pedestrians and joggers than any other state. 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase "they were taking a shortcut" makes a pretty lousy epitaph and 
offers small consolation for the loved ones left behind.

TEMPER COURAGE WITH CAUTION; CORRECT RESPONSE SHOULD BE TO FIRST CALL THE 
POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, we commented on the story of B.R. Chavez, a 77-year-old San 
Fernando Valley man who made a citizen's arrest of a graffiti vandal. It was a 
courageous response, but the circumstances were very important. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez was on a crowded bus where a few folks might have come to his aid had 
things gone awry. Also, he waited until he saw a police car just ahead of the 
bus before he asked the driver to stop and announced that he was nabbing the 
two teen-agers who were busy defiling the bus' interior. The police were 
flagged and they took the boys into custody.

Diego, Jesus Reynoso and other Los Angeles sanitation workers were no less 
heroic. But they do point out the dangers of taking direct action against 
criminals instead of trying to immediately notify authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcala also put the collar on a graffiti tagger. The youth put up a fight and 
threatened to hurt Alcala. He also vowed to damage Alcala's prized 1958 
Chevrolet Apache pickup truck. Alcala received a reward for his troubles, but 
he was lucky to escape the incident with ripped trousers. The youth could have 
been armed with a dangerous weapon, and he might have been inclined to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more serious was the incident Wednesday in which Alfredo Diego noticed 
suspected gang members attacking a homeless couple. He immediately -- and 
bravely -- ran to their aid. Suddenly, there were 20 gang members going after 
Diego, some of them armed with knives and ice picks, and bricks and rocks. 
Jesus Reynoso and other sanitation workers then rushed in to help Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the sanitation workers were injured, one seriously when he was struck 
in the head by a brick. Reynoso was stabbed just above his left hip. The gang 
finally fled when the LAPD was called. That call to the LAPD should have been 
the first response, not one of the last.

WHAT THE LATIN NAME OF THE MOCKINGBIRD MEANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Professor Don Salper's article "Nature's Silver Lining" (July 24) on the 
song of the mockingbird made very interesting reading. He errs, however, in 
describing "polyglottos" as many-tongued -- a reference quite likely to the 
highly developed syrinx (avian voice box) of this remarkable bird. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Linnaeus binomial classification of our western mockingbird ( Mimus 
polyglottos leucopterus ), the modifier " leucopterus " has been added as a 
reference to the white spots on the wings seen from above as this handsome bird 
glides over the ground.

BURBANK: DO THE RIGHT THING; THE CITY'S LEADERSHIP NEEDS TO WELCOME PEOPLE OF 
COLOR, OR BE OVERRUN BY ALIENATED SOULS WHO JUST DON'T CARE. ONE DISILLUSIONED 
COUPLE FLEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By SHARON WOODSON-BRYANT, Sharon Woodson-Bryant has moved to Miami, where she 
is public relations director for the chairman of the Dade County Board of 
Commissioners. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As I helped my husband pack to leave our home in California for the last time, 
I stopped a moment to look at our poster from the 1984 Olympics. It had 
decorated our hallway as a sort of symbol of the optimism we felt a decade ago 
when we moved to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is cracked from the earthquake, a less upbeat symbol of our episode in 
Southern California -- an area undergoing an economic, political and spiritual 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession that started in 1990, the riots of 1992, the Jan. 17 quake -- 
all contributed to our desire to move on. No longer did there appear to be a 
shared vision among local leaders. Nor was there a sense of hopefulness within 
the community. And job prospects for African Americans that offered a better 
quality of life became more dismal each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually our disillusionment started soon after we bought a townhouse in 
Burbank, where we had been attracted by the wholesome appearance and handy 
location. My husband-to-be had relocated from Florida, and I had moved from San 
Francisco to get married. Overwhelmed by the vastness of L.A., we hoped for the 
feeling of a small community. But we sensed a problem when my younger brother 
was stopped by Burbank police while walking from the grocery store carrying a 
sack. When they discovered it was a quart of milk, they let him go. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm bidding farewell to Burbank as well as California. Along with the rest of 
the region, the city has seen enormous change in the past 10 years. Perhaps 
more than most, Burbank's leadership needs an attitude adjustment if the city 
is to thrive in the next 10. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We felt that Burbank -- traditional, white Burbank -- held an icy contempt for 
African Americans and other people of color. Not that there were many of us. 
After months of shopping without seeing any other blacks, I had to laugh the 
day a man stopped in the supermarket and pointed me out to his wife. "Look, 
there is another black person besides us in Burbank," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, a less humorous incident occurred when my husband got a 
speeding ticket. He and a young Latino man were stopped and he was written up 
as another officer trained his radar gun on passing cars. Peeking at the gun, 
my husband saw two white women in their early twenties speed by, going 10 
m.p.h. over the limit -- just as he had been accused of doing -- without 
getting stopped. Incidents like that force a black or brown person to question 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to get involved in the community, my husband saw an ad for a 
volunteer to do graphic design for a private agency's newsletter. When he 
arrived, an older white woman (a volunteer herself) turned him down, saying 
they didn't want a Latino for the position. Latino? My husband is African 
American. He is also persistent. He called back later, talked to an apologetic 
staff member and managed to donate his services. But as we saw it, he'd had 
another unpleasant encounter with Old Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As time went by, I shared some of these stories with a co-worker whose parents 
are Puerto Rican. She said that since moving to Burbank she could remember 
numerous experiences in which she was treated differently from her mother. In 
stores, she would be served first and more politely. She believed this is 
because she is fair and blond and her mother is brown skinned. 
</P>
<P>
 Such moments cling tenaciously to your memory, undermining your self-esteem. 
And unless the city's leadership begins embracing those of us who are "new to 
the neighborhood," they will see Burbank eroded by a myriad of people who have 
no connection to the structure and no motivation to build, protect and keep it 
safe, clean and desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank cops no longer stop the young black male for walking in the street as 
they did my brother 10 years ago. But that is not because attitudes have 
changed -- it's because the city has changed. After a decade of social change, 
we no longer stand out. Now there are gangs and a growing influx of people who 
don't know, understand or feel connected to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the city's leaders identify and work with people who are advocates for 
these groups, people who are accountable to their ethnic communities. Without a 
sense of belonging, the community will be overrun by alienated souls who just 
don't care. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone needs to encourage them. The city's leadership needs to get outside 
its narrow, traditional boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I recall reading that one Burbank high school did not celebrate Black History 
Month in February. A news article indicated that because of the small number of 
African-American students, an administrator felt that the time should be 
devoted to academic activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone missed the point. School administrators should realize that the month 
is a tool toward recognizing the importance of contributions African Americans 
have made to this country. White students must become sensitive to a broad, 
diverse society. 
</P>
<P>
 The test of Burbank's character will require more than applauding politicians 
and passing resolutions. In the end, it's not the laws but the lives we lead. 
Embracing and valuing diversity bring a commonality of hope. My hope is that 
Burbank will take the right path despite the risks. But it will take community 
leaders with courage.

CITY'S QUEST FOR DWP DOLLARS COULD BACKFIRE; MAYOR BELIEVES EFFICIENCY CAN 
ELIMINATE WASTE. BUT TRANSFERRING SAVINGS TO THE POLICE MAKES THE EFFORT A 
RATIONALE FOR ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON FURGATCH, Leon Furgatch of Granada Hills is a retired manager of 
community relations and educational services for the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is obvious that Mayor Richard Riordan is achieving some success in his 
efforts to extract money from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to 
fulfill his campaign pledge to hire more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in doing so, the mayor has triggered a lawsuit that could not only 
foil this effort but also threaten the multimillion-dollar contributions the 
DWP makes to the city annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP is the largest of the three money-making city departments established 
by the City Charter as independent agencies whose funds are set aside for their 
own operations. The others are Airports and Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 City fathers provided this protection to prevent politicians from raiding the 
till and weakening these departments so they could not compete in the 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The major differences between these publicly owned "businesses" and private 
companies are that there are no stockholders to share in profits and most 
employees are hired through a civil service system. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, Los Angeles citizens have been rewarded with lower rates. In 
addition, the DWP has been able to contribute 5% of its gross revenues to the 
city's general fund and still maintain the competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer was initiated years ago to silence critics who charged the DWP 
was competing unfairly with private utilities because it did not pay city 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The charter allows for such a contribution if the funds are "surplus." The 
city budgets for this money and would be in trouble without it. In 1994 it 
amounts to $122 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Riordan believes he can extract even more money by introducing 
private-sector efficiencies to eliminate waste. However, his plan to transfer 
the savings to the police makes efficiency meaningless to DWP bill payers, and 
it becomes a rationale for robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for this debate, the public's desire for more police protection 
and events surrounding last year's DWP strike have clouded the issue and 
provided the mayor with the impetus and support for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle's widely publicized attack on the DWP for lavish 
spending for catered meals for supervisors during the strike, and the ripple 
effect on the police and other city employees who requested me-too raises, 
seriously damaged the utility management's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, which like Riordan is frustrated over its inability to tap 
into more of the utility's funds, was so enraged by the strike that it hired a 
firm to audit the DWP in an effort to find a way to exert more control over the 
utility. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Councilman Joel Wachs is an outspoken advocate of this goal, but he 
believes it can only be achieved by amending the charter. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit concluded that the DWP was wastefully overstaffed. It called for the 
DWP to cut its 11,630-person work force by one-fourth through attrition. 
Interestingly, it also suggested that the projected yearly savings of $223 
million could help pay for the expansion of the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit is suspect because the city's population has increased by more than 
1 million since 1950, with a corresponding increase in the DWP's services and 
properties, yet the number of employees has remained at an average of 10,000 
during the 44-year period, fluctuating from a high of 12,800 in 1970 to a low 
of 7,524 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 However, neither the audit nor Riordan has addressed the constraints that were 
expressly written into the City Charter to prevent the money transfers they 
envision. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has seriously challenged such transfers until the mayor began a 
campaign to alter the way the utility manages its pension plan and to siphon 
off the anticipated annual savings of more than $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 His appointees on the DWP Retirement Plan Board are presently one vote shy of 
achieving this goal, which is opposed by employee members. The mayor's newest 
appointee, William McCarley, is expected to cast the winning vote when he 
settles into his new job as general manager and chief engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With this appointment, the mayor has again winked at the City Charter. 
McCarley's background has been in the political arena, but the charter calls 
for a person with broad experience in hydraulic or electrical engineering for 
the manager's job. McCarley will be the first general manager in DWP history 
who is not an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 He is stepping into a fray with employees whose fears have been fanned by 
numerous stories about industry pension plans that have been raided, leaving 
retirees with little or no pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents the 
largest group of employees, is suing the city. The suit challenges the annual 
5% transfer, the anticipated pension fund transfer and the recent transfer of 
$78 million to the city from the sale of surplus real estate and power plant 
fuel oil that the DWP had been holding for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 If the court rules that the charter has been violated, it is entirely possible 
that all of the funds will be returned to the ratepayers, including the $122 
million transferred to the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 If this happens, Mayor Riordan's actions will have plunged the city into a 
financial crisis.

LIKE IT OR NOT, CHILDREN OPEN THEIR LIVES TO TEACHERS; PARENTS WHO COMPLAIN 
ABOUT THE INVASIVENESS OF THE CLAS TEST FAIL TO REALIZE HOW MUCH THEIR 
YOUNGSTERS REVEAL ABOUT THEIR FAMILY LIFE IN A NORMAL SCHOOL DAY.

 I should have been more alert when my dental hygienist wasn't her usual 
friendly self. We were halfway through my cleaning when she commented on an 
article I'd written in favor of the California Learning Assessment System 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 She vigorously picked and scraped at my teeth while protesting the 
insensitivity with which test makers were poking around in children's psyches. 
Her sixth-grade daughter had cried during the test because there had been a 
literary reference to a pet, and hers had recently died. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I've followed the CLAS debate, I hadn't realized how isolated I'd 
been from the average parent. My hygienist is a well-educated, conscientious 
parent who went to her child's school to examine the tests after her daughter 
came home in tears. She's not a fanatic, and I can't readily dismiss her demand 
that the CLAS not delve into children's personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To her and to all parents like her, it bears repeating: The CLAS test is not 
designed to uncover your family secrets. But kids respond -- they reveal 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-grader Mark (a made-up name, like the others in this article) was given 
the writing assignment, "Describe three places you like to be alone." When he 
started writing, not even he knew he would write about a cemetery and how much 
he misses his grandmother. It was a feeling he hadn't even shared with his 
father. His father, a man I know, told me about it later and expressed 
surprise. I told him things like that happen all the time. Writing is 
revealing. 
</P>
<P>
 If we want children to learn to communicate orally and in writing, they need 
to practice, and we can't always control what they'll choose to write or speak 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, a Sherman Oaks teacher friend of mine sat in the back of the room 
alongside two parents when 6-year-old Stanley volunteered for "show and tell." 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother has a Land Rover, but she doesn't like it very much," he said. "She 
wants to buy another car, but she doesn't want to spend the money. Last week, 
she left the keys in the car hoping someone would come during the night and 
take it. But nobody came." Stanley further elaborated on his mother's efforts, 
concluding, "I'll let you know when someone steals it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose I've taken for granted that parents know how much their children 
share with their teachers. Royce Bellatty, a counselor at A. E. Wright Middle 
School in Calabasas, concludes her open house speech to parents with the 
comment: "If you don't believe everything your children tell you about our 
school and about their teachers, we promise not to believe everything they tell 
us about you." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been plenty of times when I didn't know what to believe. Students 
talk. They talk to teachers all the time. Revelations are unsolicited and take 
many forms. Many students consider teachers, like priests, to be sexless 
nonentities, receptacles into which they can dump their problems. Teachers 
don't have to go out of their way to learn more than they ever want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivia, an 11th-grader, selected spousal abuse as the topic for her research 
paper -- this was before the Simpson-Goldman murders. After she presented her 
findings to the class she told me, in confidence, that she was worried about 
her mother. She also worried her drunk father would turn on her. I gave Olivia 
a domestic abuse hot-line number. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how careful we are not to probe, student revelations come unbidden 
and unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sylmar High I once chided a student about his missing homework. After class 
Larry apologized. He and his dad had been living in their car, subsisting on 
bologna sandwiches. My husband said nothing when I brought Larry and his dad 
home, where they stayed a few weeks until they could make other arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do kids talk to their teachers? Because we're there. We see your children 
every day. We notice them sitting off by themselves. When they talk, we don't 
yell, even when we don't approve of their behavior. And they know we can't 
ground them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't talk about personal matters to my teachers when I was a young student 
because I had a dozen aunts and uncles living nearby who acted as surrogate 
parents. Today, kids have so many problems, so many more issues to deal with. 
Too often there's no adult they feel close to so teachers fill in -- 
reluctantly. Teachers didn't ask for this extra unpaid job. It comes with the 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't want your kids to reveal your family secrets, keep the 
communication open and honest. When parents take care of their business, 
teachers will be able to go back to taking care of theirs.

SAN ONOFRE PROPOSAL GENERATES RENEWED DEBATE; UTILITIES: A RECOMMENDATION TO 
CLOSE THE ALWAYS CONTROVERSIAL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN 1998 HAS ADVOCATES AND 
OPPONENTS FOCUSING ON ECONOMIC ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Controversy has surrounded the San Onofre nuclear power plant since that 
afternoon in 1968 when former Rep. Chet Holifield pulled the ceremonial first 
switch, sparking the 395-megawatt Unit 1 reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 Holifield was joined by Glenn T. Seaborg of the Atomic Energy Commission at 
the opening of what was then the world's largest nuclear energy producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are substantially further along in the peaceful use of the atom than any 
other country," Seaborg told the luncheon gathering at the 83-acre Camp 
Pendleton site leased from the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen years later, two other reactor units were built on the site, each 
rated to supply 1,127 megawatts of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 26-year history of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station -- which 
supplies 12% of the power used by customers of Southern California Edison, the 
principal owner -- has not been so peaceful. Anti-nuclear groups concerned 
about radiation, ocean pollution and the possibility of a nuclear catastrophe 
have rallied against the plant since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, opponents of the plant found a powerful ally in the Division of 
Ratepayer Advocates, a department of the Public Utilities Commission, that has 
put the future of the entire plant at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratepayer advocates contended at a proceeding last April that the plant's 
operating costs are far too high and that SCE customers could save as much as 
$1 billion if the plant closed in 1998, 15 years ahead of schedule. The PUC is 
not expected to act on the recommendation until December or early next year, 
but debate over the San Onofre issue has again been stoked. 
</P>
<P>
 Radioactive waste and safety issues aside, opponents argue, the nuclear energy 
industry is dead in this country because cheaper sources of power -- natural 
gas, solar, wind -- are available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nuclear power is not cost-effective," said Marion Pack, spokeswoman for the 
Santa Ana-based Alliance for Survival, which opposes nuclear power. "Whether 
San Onofre is shut in 1998 or 2013, we are still going to have people who need 
to be retrained and moved into new employment. Let's get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents, who include union representatives of the plant's workers, dispute 
the DRA's figures and point out San Onofre's importance to the Southern 
California economy and that nuclear power does not pollute the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Onofre is absolutely vital to our community," said David N. Lund, San 
Clemente's director of economic development. "To just decide to shut a plant 
down that employs nearly 3,000 people, with a $1.2-billion impact on the 
region, has to be done very, very carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the pressure to close the plant comes at a time when it has never 
operated more smoothly, say officials of Southern California Edison, which owns 
75% of the plant. San Diego Gas & Electric owns another 20%, with utilities in 
Anaheim and Riverside owning about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 The original reactor was closed in November, 1992, after similar rounds of PUC 
hearings, but Units 2 and 3 are now operating at more than 80% of capacity, 
considered a mark of superior performance in the industry, said Joe Wambold, 
manager of business and finance for the nuclear department of SCE. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be a banner year for production," said Wambold, a Laguna Niguel 
resident. "Unit 2 has been on line for more than 370 days of continual service 
of full power. We are very proud of our record." 
</P>
<P>
 Wambold said SCE has filed a lengthy rebuttal to the DRA recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fundamental position is that we have demonstrated that this plant is the 
lowest-cost alternative to our customers," Wambold said. "Whether from the 
viewpoint of economics, safety, impacts on the environment or waste disposal, 
the facts speak very well for the continued operation of these plants." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the debate over nuclear power centered on 
issues of safety and security. Today the focus has shifted to questions of 
radioactive waste storage and economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you asked the average citizen what their greatest concern is when 
it comes to nuclear power, they'd still say safety," said Chris Nichols, a 
spokeswoman for the Washington-based Safe Energy Communication Council, a 
nuclear watchdog agency. "But people are looking at their pocketbook these days 
on all issues." 
</P>
<P>
 DRA officials estimate that it costs as much as $600 million a year to operate 
Units 2 and 3 at San Onofre. Electrical rates are particularly high in 
California primarily because of the nuclear investments that local utilities 
have made, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wall Street has definitely rejected nuclear power," Nichols said. "You can't 
get financing, and when you can't get financing, that's a resounding 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
 Nuclear power advocates agree that no new nuclear plants are being built in 
the United States but note that they are moving forward elsewhere in the world, 
including in Japan, Germany and Korea. To abandon nuclear power, particularly 
for such an exhaustible commodity as natural gas, would be shortsighted, they 
argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strength of our electrical system is the diversity of our fuel supply," 
said Marvin Fertel, vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute in 
Washington. "That was proven last January in the East during that bad cold 
wave. The coal piles froze, the oil tankers couldn't get to shore because of 
frozen ports, and natural gas was needed for other industrial and residential 
uses. But nuclear power stayed on line." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few years ago natural gas was considered too expensive to burn for 
electricity, but "now it's a panacea," Fertel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really shouldn't rely on any one particular source for electricity," he 
said. "We all take electricity for granted, but it's really important to our 
quality of life."

VIETNAM TRIP DENOUNCED BY NOISY CROWD; PROTEST: ABOUT 60 PEOPLE OPPOSED TO 
CLOSER TIES WITH THE COMMUNIST REGIME DEMONSTRATE OUTSIDE LOCAL GROUP'S SEMINAR 
AND CRITICIZE ITS PLANS FOR TRADE MISSION.

 Angered by plans for a trade delegation sponsored by Orange County's 
Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce to meet with top officials in Vietnam next 
month, about 60 people staged a noisy but orderly protest Saturday morning 
outside a hotel where the chamber hosted a daylong business seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional crowd, which held up signs and banners and waved the flag of the 
former Republic of Vietnam, shouted slogans such as "No Freedom, No Trade!" 
</P>
<P>
 Extra security people were stationed at entrances to Quality Hotel meeting 
rooms, and seminar attendees were required to pass through metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the trade mission clearly touched off an emotional response among 
the protesters, many of them expatriate Vietnamese whose bitterness toward the 
current rulers of their homeland quickly bubbled to the surface Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Communists, they killed us and we had to leave our country where we were 
born," said Jo Le. "People died. My aunt died. My uncle died. People are still 
dying. We would love to go back to Vietnam, but not under the Communists." 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber of Commerce president Co Pham, who watched the demonstration with his 
bodyguard only yards away from the protesters, responded that "this is a free 
country and they have the right to freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
 The six-hour demonstration was organized by the Vietnamese Community of 
Southern California, one of the largest Vietnamese American groups in the 
Southland. The group is strongly opposed to closer ties with the Communist 
regime in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese language newspapers revealed Thursday that a chamber-sponsored 
delegation, eager to improve trade between the United States and Vietnam, is 
scheduled to meet with President Le Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and 
other top government officials in September. The delegation of business 
representatives, which is still being put together, so far includes only a 
handful of Vietnamese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Le, a 30-year-old dentist from Hacienda Heights, said she heard about the 
protest on the radio and stopped by to participate briefly before heading to 
her practice, where patients were waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to leave my practice to be here, but I felt it was important," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lan Pham, a 47-year-old civil engineer from Irvine who was especially critical 
of the chamber president, led the demonstration through much of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Co Pham is a traitor! Down with Co Pham!" Lan Pham shouted repeatedly into a 
megaphone. 
</P>
<P>
 If Co Pham goes to Vietnam, "he helps the government keep their position," Lan 
Pham said in an interview. "He is going to meet with them and party with them 
while a lot of people are still living in the streets with no food. He came 
here as a political refugee, and now he has betrayed us." 
</P>
<P>
 Co Pham said he is sensitive to the accusations against him but believes the 
protesters do not speak for a majority of Vietnamese expatriates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we can't please everybody," he said. "We are educating the Vietnamese 
who want to do business because we're the chamber. We want to build a bridge 
between the United States and Vietnam. At the same time that we trade, we still 
demand human rights and democracy. My dream is to bring democracy to Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 A Times poll taken shortly after President Clinton lifted the U.S. trade 
embargo against Vietnam in February found that 54% of the Vietnamese living in 
Southern California favored full diplomatic relations with Vietnam and the 
lifting of the trade sanctions. Just 20% voiced opposition to those moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Co Pham said advertising for the seminar was kept to a minimum in order to 
prevent protests. He said he was pleased that approximately 200 people showed 
up Saturday, despite the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Seminar participants chatted in the hotel hallway between sessions and said 
they were unfazed by the protest going on outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand why they are here, and certainly their cause is proper," 
said Cang Le, a businessman and consultant. "But I think they need to sit down 
and communicate with Co Pham. They are not reconciling with each other. I see 
that Pham is setting aside the past. But for them, the past is not over yet."

A REAL SEA CHANGE; TEENS LEAVE TROUBLES ON SHORE IN 'SAIL FOR LIFE' PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In their homes and neighborhoods temptations beckon. But on Saturday six young 
people who had served time in Orange County Juvenile Hall escaped their 
troubles and set sail aboard a schooner. 
</P>
<P>
 They eagerly took orders, working together as a crew to learn the ways of the 
wind and tides and how to have fun apart from the drugs and gangs that landed 
them in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers who set sail from Alamitos Bay Saturday morning were happy for 
a chance to get away. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I weren't here, I would hang around the house being bored and watching my 
mother do drugs," said Christopher, 17, who joined the outing despite a 
tendency to get seasick. 
</P>
<P>
 These teens are part of an innovative program for juvenile offenders called 
Sail for Life that was founded three years ago by Tom and Michelle Hancock of 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 When in short sleeves, Tom Hancock's tattooed arms betray his own rebellious 
childhood. He concedes that he spent most of his time from age 11 to 21 behind 
bars for breaking the law. It started, he said, when he ran away from a foster 
home on a stolen horse and ended with a sentencing to San Quentin for armed 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock, 54, who now works as a construction foreman and runs an insurance 
agency with his wife, said a probation officer showed him another path that led 
to school and success. Working with the Orange County Probation Department, he 
hopes the sailing program will offer the same opportunity for other kids who 
got off to a bad start in life. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Hancock helps with the outings, giving rides to those who can't 
otherwise get to the dock on Saturdays and listening with concern to their 
problems. Tom Hancock said there are about 200 young people now enrolled in 
Sail for Life, learning what it takes, from hoisting sails to navigating by the 
stars and sun, to become seasoned sailors. 
</P>
<P>
 Most join the program while confined at Orange County Juvenile Hall or Joplin 
Ranch, another county youth correctional facility. Some had never spent a day 
by the sea nor sunk a toe in the sand before, although they grew up in Southern 
California.  
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, probation workers say, the youths gain self-esteem, make 
friends and learn about a more wholesome lifestyle. Many keep with it after 
they are released and on probation. They are first hooked by the simple thrill 
of sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least a dozen kids have said to me, 'I didn't know I could have so much 
fun without being loaded,' " said Norman Shattuck, assistant director at the 
county Juvenile Hall in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 During Saturday's sail off Long Beach, Jeanette Marie Deno, 18, passed a test 
culminating 13 weeks of nautical schooling and was promoted to chief boatswain, 
meaning she could give orders to the rest of the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Deno, who now lives at home in Irvine with her parents, said she served 14 
months in Juvenile Hall for crimes that included auto theft and assault and 
battery while she was under the influence of drugs. The Sail For Life program, 
she said, has given her hope of becoming a professional sailor on a cruise ship 
or yacht. 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledges that at first she joined the program just for the chance to 
leave Juvenile Hall for a few hours. She didn't expect she would enjoy sailing. 
"I never liked the ocean. It was deep and I'm afraid of heights," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To her surprise, she said, sailing introduced her to "a whole totally 
different world. It is so awesome. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Several others on Saturday's trip said that although they still are mystified 
about many of the technical aspects of sailing, they welcomed the diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need this to take up my time until I feel strong enough to fight off the 
urge" for drugs, said Christopher, who said he was released last week from 
Juvenile Hall and is determined not to go back. He is planning to enroll this 
fall at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
 Filemon, 16, said he goes sailing on Saturdays to avoid the gangs in his 
Anaheim neighborhood. "I realize now that these are really my true friends," he 
said, nodding toward the others aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the Sail for Life members said they especially appreciated the 
commitment of the Hancocks to answer their calls any time if they need 
counseling to stay off drugs or alcohol. But sometimes, Tom Hancock said, the 
teen-agers wait too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich, 16, who was taking a turn at the helm, concentrating on keeping the 
schooner on course, said he had returned a second time to Juvenile Hall because 
he had again gotten high on drugs. He said that only two days after his release 
from the hall, he called Tom Hancock to confess. 
</P>
<P>
 The skipper said it was his duty to turn the youth over to authorities. "He 
knew I had to do it," he said. "He was asking for help." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Hancock gave lessons in seamanship with a mixture of discipline 
and humor. "Pull the halyards -- faster, faster!" he coached as the schooner 
left the Explorer Sea Scout base at Alamitos Bay and headed toward the sea. 
"Amazing, but we're under sail," he said a few minutes later, grinning broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hancocks volunteer their time and money to run Sail for Life, which has 
affiliated with the Sea Explorer Scouts, and they have enlisted other adult 
volunteers as well to serve as instructors, friends and role models. The seven 
boats used in the program are gifts to Sail for Life or have been made 
available on Saturdays by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The 64-foot teakwood schooner that set sail Saturday was donated for the day 
by Dave Spencer, who lives on the yacht. Spencer, a contract manager at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, joined the excursion, proudly sharing 
tidbits about the history of the craft, which was built in Vietnam. Hancock 
said he is striving to raise more money and attract more volunteers to expand 
the sailing program to other Sea Explorer Scout bases. He has his eye on a 
114-foot yacht he would like to buy and turn into a floating school for high 
school dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "One kid last year didn't know math, so I made him a navigator, and then he 
got straight A's," he said. "These kids just need to get motivated and pointed 
in the right direction."

HUNTINGTON BEACH'S PIERFEST REELS THEM IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The third annual Huntington Beach Pierfest was the place to be Saturday for 
thousands of fun seekers from near and far to sample some of the best Surf City 
has to offer in sports, food and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa resident Victoria Gardner said she probably would have been riding 
her bicycle at the beach this weekend anyway but ventured to Huntington Beach 
because she knew it was Pierfest weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it, especially this music right now," she said to the blare of a salsa 
band on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Peterson, 9, of Irvine, said the milk-bottle cap booth was his 
favorite part of the "Kids' Cove" because "They have more sorts of POGs and you 
can play without (risking) your own POGs." 
</P>
<P>
 He also enjoyed a game booth where he played a water-balloon toss with his 
aunt. Matthew was happy he lost because he got soaking wet -- and a splash of 
relief from heat in the 80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Chloe Stavich, 9, of Costa Mesa, said this year's Pierfest was better than 
last year's "because they have a lot more games. I won a first-place ribbon and 
some (prize) tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 The event, sponsored by the Surf City Foundation, continues today from 10 a.m. 
to 8 p.m. on the beach and on Main Street at Pacific Coast Highway. The lineup 
includes a Surf City concert by Jan and Dean, the Surfaris, the Kingsmen, the 
Chantays and the Tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversions Saturday ranged from the usual people watching along the bike path 
and on the sand to continuous musical entertainment, in-line skate stunt 
competition, powerboat races, arts and crafts booths and plenty of food. 
Organizers estimated that 125,000 turned out throughout the day.  
</P>
<P>
 Sitting beside the bike path noshing on a Thai rice bowl combo, 29-year-old 
Royal Moore, from Portland, Ore., said he was impressed with his first visit to 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I flew down for this. I had a friend here who said, 'If you're going to come 
down once, make it this weekend,' " he said. "I told him I'm coming back. It's 
just a complete laid-back atmosphere and I really like it. I think it's 
California at its best." 
</P>
<P>
 Throngs of visitors wandered through downtown, where the Main Street 
redevelopment boom has drawn new businesses, launching a trend that promises to 
continue when a recently approved Pier Plaza complex is built. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.4-million plaza, due by summer of 1996, will add a new and wider 
boardwalk, an amphitheater, lawn area and improved restrooms and showers, as 
well as expanded auto and bicycle parking -- both in high demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's vendor and restaurant area got off to a rocky start because of 
some misunderstandings, but vendors were mostly pleased with the event by 
midday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a while to get started, but once it got started, it's working great," 
said Damon DeGrignon, a Dana Point vendor who was selling insulated, cooling 
neckbands and hat liners that were a hot item. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't very well organized. The booths weren't numbered and people didn't 
know where to go," he said. "Then they were charging when it started. Nothing 
was done until someone mentioned it was advertised as a free event." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizer Paul Cook said the snafu was because advertising noted free 
admission to "concerts and events," but many people were unaware of a $1 gate 
charge for the Pier Taste restaurant fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was easily solved: By about 10 a.m., the gate admission was waived 
and each hungry visitor had an extra dollar to spend on samples of ethnic 
cuisine.

UNEARTHING ENTHUSIASM; PROJECT AIMS TO BOOST MINORITY STUDENTS' INTEREST IN 
SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no hesitancy in the voice of Michael Forrest of the Southern 
California Earthquake Center when he exhorted a party of 35 elementary school 
teachers to scramble a couple hundred feet up a dusty, steep and slippery slope 
to take a close look at an ancient fault near Portuguese Bend. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the most part, there was no hesitancy among the teachers either. A few 
held back, but the overwhelming majority, some holding on to one another, 
clambered up the slope until they could touch the fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Forrest explained that they were at a place which 15 million years ago, when 
the Los Angeles Basin was opening up geologically, had seen a major sinking of 
crustal blocks, other important earth movements and dramatic upwellings of 
lava. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in some respects an unusual science field trip. The teachers -- part of 
a larger group of 160 from 32 schools on the south and east sides of Los 
Angeles -- were not specialists in science, and they came from schools in which 
there has been little instruction in science or enthusiasm for the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The field trip on the Palos Verdes Peninsula occurred during a two-week 
Institute in the Earth Sciences. The summer program was one component of an 
elaborate three-year project financed by the National Science Foundation and 
private foundations designed to ultimately improve the woeful 
underrepresentation of blacks and Latinos among those who earn advanced college 
science degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures supplied by the NSF, only 5.9% of all science and 
engineering doctorates earned in 1992 nationwide went to U.S. minorities, who 
constitute 24.8% of the total population, and many of those degrees went to 
Asian Americans. That year, only 40 more African Americans earned such 
doctorates than in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks, constituting 12.1% of the total U.S. population in the 1990 census, 
only made up 1.9% of the employed scientists and engineers with doctorates in 
1991, the latest year for which figures are available. Latinos, making up 9% of 
the nation's population, constituted only 1.6% of scientists and engineers with 
doctorates. Native Americans, 0.8% of the population, formed only 0.2% of the 
scientific and engineering work force with doctorates. Asian Americans, by 
contrast, made up only 2.9% of the population, but 6.9% of that work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the current elementary school training project, Lois Slavkin, executive 
director of the Center to Advance Precollege Science Education at USC, said: 
"This is not meant to be a course. It is simply meant to develop interest and 
enthusiasm among the teachers for science instruction." 
</P>
<P>
 All too often, Slavkin said, what elementary instruction is offered takes 
place "in a haphazard, unplanned way. The students are turned off because the 
teachers are turned off, and they don't grow up with any science in their 
lives," accounting for the paucity of minority science students at the college 
and postgraduate levels. 
</P>
<P>
 A mission statement developed by the USC center says: "Two factors conspire to 
exacerbate the underrepresentation of low-income minority students in the 
sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, the vast majority of elementary teachers have little or no science in 
their background. Second, when children 'turn off' to science, it is often as 
early as the third or fourth grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taken together, the outcome is too little science taught poorly to students 
who quickly become permanently disinterested in science as an academic major or 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In developing the training program, which costs about $1 million a year, 
Slavkin's group sought out school principals and teachers who would agree to 
put extra effort into the project, including forming science clubs on their 
campuses and requiring parent participation in them alongside their youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are numerous follow-up sessions to the summer training. Five 
Saturdays a year, teachers attend these, as well as a weeklong winter retreat. 
Each school also receives several thousand dollars worth of instructional 
materials from the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the teachers involved this summer were in their third year of 
participation. The first summer program was devoted to the life sciences, the 
second to the physical sciences and this year's to the earth sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to field trips, there were lectures and discussions this summer at 
the Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet School on the Eastside. Although much 
scientific information was imparted, the teachers were told they should seek to 
convey what they had learned in informal ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to move away from the lecture format, in which the student is a 
passive recipient of information and the teacher is the sole imparter of 
knowledge, and toward interactive, student-centered, hands-on delivery of 
knowledge in which the teacher is a facilitator," Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers participating in the program said this was a good year to focus on 
the earth sciences, since the Jan. 17 earthquake awakened a natural interest 
among most students in the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that the more abstract it is the less they're interested," said 
Elizabeth Salcido, a fifth-grade teacher from an Eastside school. "Physics, 
they love, however, and the earthquake fascinated everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Coutts, a Van Nuys High School teacher who has been one of the instructors 
this summer, said the elementary teachers have told him that those students who 
studied the quake have suffered a lot less anxiety about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Learning about the earth is a unifying thing too," he said. "The earth 
belongs to everyone, and this concept overcomes prejudice. We're trying to get 
the kids to buy into that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Huff, a science coordinator from the Fresno County Office of Education, 
which is also participating in the program, said the main problem is that in 
many schools science is not regarded as a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just more science we're striving to teach, but it's science 
presented in a different way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One goal of the effort is the eventual opening of a science-oriented 
elementary school at the Museum of Science and Industry, just across Exposition 
Boulevard from USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District schools with teams of teachers 
participating in the program are 36th Street, 54th Street, 75th Street, 93rd 
Street, 122nd Street, Ambler Avenue, Angeles Mesa, Corona Avenue, Figueroa 
Street, Ford Boulevard, Glenfeliz Boulevard, Harrison Street, Heliotrope 
Avenue, Holmes Avenue, Martin Luther King Jr., Leo Politi, Lockwood Avenue, 
Loma Vista Avenue, Montara Avenue, Murchison Street, Betty Plasencia, Robert F. 
Kennedy, Rosemont Avenue, San Miguel, Selma Avenue, South Park, Stanford 
Avenue, Sunrise, Utah Street, Vernon City, Windsor Hills and Woodcrest.

JUVENILE HALL IS ADDING WING FOR VIOLENT OFFENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Juvenile Hall will become the largest and most 
jail-like county youth facility in the nation when a high-security wing for 
violent teen-agers is completed two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the $16-million expansion of the Sylmar facility began last 
month. When completed in 1996, the wing will include two high-security 
buildings -- containing 160 beds -- equipped with a high-tech audio system for 
staff and visual monitors through which they can watch the youths' movements. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans also call for an automatic gate and fence surrounding the facility and a 
more secure entryway for the hall, with a bulletproof room to protect staff 
from new inmates or visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are meeting a need," said Ed Anhalt, supervisor of the Juvenile Hall, 
which has 453 beds but in recent years has struggled to accommodate an average 
of 620 inmates at a time, about 50 of them considered violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a statement on what is happening in the community: We have an increase 
in violent offenders," Anhalt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project also comes in the midst of a national debate over whether 
incarceration or prevention is the best way to combat the growing numbers of 
violent youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't anything in this country that is going to come close to L.A. when 
this facility is built," said Earl Dunlap, executive director of the National 
Juvenile Detention Assn., which oversees the more than 400 county youth 
detention facilities in the country. "But they can't build their way out of the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 No one disputes the stark facts: Violent crime among youths is on the rise 
nationwide, with the number of minors accused of murder, rape, aggravated 
assault and robbery growing 68% from 1988 to 1992, according to a recent study 
by the U.S. Justice Department. In Los Angeles County, there was a slight 
decline last year, but the numbers remain high: nearly 10,000 violent youths 
were arrested in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other county juvenile halls, the Sylmar facility is a holding place for 
youths awaiting a judge's sentence, which for the most serious offenders could 
mean a transfer to the California Youth Authority -- the state's youth prison 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the more than 26,000 young prisoners held at San Fernando Valley 
Juvenile Hall every year, officials said, only the hardest-core -- those who 
have killed, raped, beaten or robbed, or are suicidal -- will be placed in the 
high-security unit to prevent them from harming others or escaping. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past five years, Anhalt said, there have been two escapes from the 
facility. In both cases the escapees were recaptured after three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the hall more secure is reasonable, Dunlap said, but he added that 
county officials should strive to keep the environment less jail-like. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of massive security is fairly unusual," he said. "They are just 
building a jail for kids. . . . Everybody says the problem in L.A. is 
different, but there are a lot of other jurisdictions in the country that are 
coming up with alternatives to lock-down." 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers are paying the price for the hard-line approach to rising youth 
crime, Dunlap said. In Los Angeles, he estimated, it costs $45,000 to jail a 
juvenile for a year, compared to about $2,000 to put one youth through a year 
of intervention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising youth crime figures nationwide have provided fuel for the fight to take 
a tougher stance, which may increase the stress on the juvenile justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 State legislators have pitched more than a dozen bills that increase penalties 
for youths, most of which are pending. Their suggestions range from 
establishing longer sentences for minors who commit violent crimes to trying 
youths as young as 14 as adults in murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Many youth experts insist that these get-tough efforts are not the best 
antidotes for a juvenile justice system already lagging in its response to the 
surge of violent offenders. They argue that the money would be better spent on 
rehabilitation and diversion programs that target at-risk youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Locking up more people is not a solution to juvenile delinquency," said John 
J. Wilson, acting administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention, which coordinates federal efforts with state and local 
programs. "Yes, we have to protect the public, but we should be putting the 
money into the front end -- through prevention programs." 
</P>
<P>
 The proportion of youths incarcerated for violent crimes in California grew 
from 44% of juvenile inmates in 1987 to 61% in 1992, California Youth Authority 
data shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city of Los Angeles, there was a slight decrease in the number of 
violent youths apprehended last year: 9,970 youths were arrested for violent 
crimes in 1993, down about 5% from the 10,477 youths arrested in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the local decrease may be the result of preventive city ordinances 
-- including curfews and laws making it illegal to sell knives, blades or other 
stabbing weapons to anyone younger than 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, local juvenile hall authorities say they remain in the midst of a 
serious housing crisis that needs to be addressed with beds, not words. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are severely limited in our space to accommodate them," Anhalt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile Hall officials so wanted to build the high-security addition to the 
facility that they lobbied for two years to get financing, finally tapping into 
Proposition 86 funds, a $500-million state bond issue designated for 
construction of juvenile halls and jails. The county provided 25% of the 
project's cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other juvenile halls that serve Los Angeles County -- Los Padrinos in 
Downey and Central in Los Angeles -- have what are considered high-security 
units. But, like other halls nationwide, their security measures are no match 
for what is planned at the Sylmar facility, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the luxury of gates and bulletproof windows around here," said 
Michael Edwards, assistant superintendent of Central Juvenile Hall. "Right now, 
our staffs' eyes and ears are our audio and visual equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, Central is the largest juvenile detention facility in the country 
with 565 beds -- although 111 cannot be used because they are in buildings 
destroyed by the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Juvenile Temporary Detention Center in Chicago is now tied with the Sylmar 
facility as the second-largest juvenile center in the country, with about 450 
beds. Los Padrinos has 431 beds.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: A COLUMNIST COMES CLEAN: YES, HE LIKES THE TABLOIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the Criminal Courts Building pressroom the other day, a few of the 
reporters were saying they had begun buying the supermarket tabloids for 
information and insights into the O.J. Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporters, who worked for traditional newspapers and wire services, were 
embarrassed to admit they were purchasing the Star, the Globe, the National 
Enquirer, the National Examiner and the rest. One said she put the papers under 
the groceries in the shopping cart before leaving the store. 
</P>
<P>
 I shared their embarrassment when I shopped for tabloids. Reporters and 
editors in the "mainstream media" such as The Times look down on their tabloid 
brothers and sisters and such headlines as the National Enquirer's "O.J.'s 
Women" or the Globe's "How Cops Framed O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 But they're probably influential. Because the tabloids are displayed at market 
checkout stands before they are sold, a huge number of people -- many more than 
actual purchasers -- see them. The garish headlines filter into their 
consciousness and become part of the tangle of facts and fancy that is shaping 
public opinion about whether or not Simpson murdered his former wife Nicole 
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With all this influence in mind, I called up editors at the National Enquirer, 
the Globe, the Star and the National Examiner. I wanted to know just how they 
were shaping the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have decided we want to concentrate on the defense side of the story 
because in the initial weeks, that wasn't being scrutinized by you guys or the 
other media," said Globe editor Phil Bunton. "His friends were telling us their 
conspiracy theories, so we decided to explore those. . . . It sold very well, 
so it has been valuable. There is a large public feeling that he didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its "How Cops Framed O.J.," the Globe hit the supermarkets Aug. 
9 with a front page featuring a drawing of a Caucasian man, accompanied by the 
headline: "This Man Did O.J. Murders!" The Globe's sister paper, the National 
Examiner, is similarly pro-defense, said editor Dan Dolan, a tabloid veteran. 
"There are massive inconsistencies in the prosecution's case," he said. "When 
the American public is forming an opinion, they should know about these 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Another big tabloid splash was the Star's Aug. 16 edition, headlined: "The Two 
Faces of O.J.'s Marriage," with "amazing first photos" of Nicole with a bruised 
face at a 1982 birthday party for Simpson. "We came up with pictures that 
showed her the night of (the) party with what a forensic medicine expert said 
was a carefully covered bruise on her cheek," said editor Richard Kaplan. "We 
felt that was visual proof of what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Do any of the tabs favor the prosecution? A couple of tabloid editors told me 
they felt the National Enquirer favored the prosecution, but articles editor 
David Perel, in charge of the paper's O.J. coverage, denied it. The Enquirer, 
he said, is just engaged in an energetic pursuit of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine full-time reporters and 11 part-timers -- the entire Los Angeles bureau 
-- were assigned to the case. The effort paid off, Perel said, in the paper's 
story about Simpson buying a knife at a Downtown cutlery shop. The shop owner, 
acting under police instructions, denied selling the knife to Simpson, Perel 
said, but the Enquirer had the purchase nailed down from its own sources. "Our 
coverage is always L.A.-intensive, so we have already established a source 
network," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Enquirer made the owner a proposition he didn't refuse: We have the story, 
the tabloid's team said. We're going to run it. But if you tell it, and give it 
to us exclusively, we'll pay you. "We paid for exclusivity," Perel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get the idea the tabloids print everything. The Globe's Bunton told me 
"we discarded several stories that didn't check out. A cop in Miami claimed he 
busted O.J. and O.J. had been in drag. He certainly was a cop in the Miami 
P.D., but we gave him a lie detector test and he went 8.0 on the Richter scale. 
He was lying through his teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I finished my research, I struggled to make sense of it. I talked to an 
editor. He said my trouble was that since I was writing for a serious paper, I 
thought I should be critical of the tabloids. "Your problem is," he said, "you 
like them." 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. The tabs remind me of a vanished era of journalism, when 
reporters and editors were underpaid, undereducated, working-class people whose 
only goal was to sell papers by giving readers the entertainment and excitement 
they craved. 
</P>
<P>
 I borrowed a book, "Jack Smith's L.A.," by our own Jack Smith, a veteran of 
those days, when much of the Establishment press operated with the 
irresponsible panache of the supermarket tabloids. I turned to the story of the 
Black Dahlia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 'The Front Page' come to life," said Smith, who was a rewrite man for 
the Daily News, one of L.A.'s four competing papers when the story broke one 
January, 1947, morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first paragraph, or lead, Smith wrote that the nude and mutilated body 
of a girl was found in a vacant Los Angeles lot, cut in half. His editor 
offered only one improvement: He wrote that she was a "beautiful" girl. "Our 
city editor, of course, no more knew what the unfortunate young woman had 
looked like than I did," Smith recalled. "But the lesson was clear. On the 
Daily News, at least, all young women whose nude bodies were found in two 
pieces on vacant lots were beautiful. I never forgot it." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was responsible for the name that made the murder famous. A reporter 
heard that the victim, Elizabeth Short, used to hang out at a Long Beach 
drugstore. "I looked the number up in the phone book and got the drugstore and 
talked to the pharmacist," Smith wrote. "Yes, he remembered Elizabeth Short. . 
. . They called her the Black Dahlia -- on account of the way she wore her 
hair." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Black Dahlia! It was a rewrite man's dream. The fates were sparing of 
such gifts. I couldn't wait to get it into type." 
</P>
<P>
 I put aside Jack's book, and tried again to think of a point to my study of 
the tabloids, something significant, something that might be quoted in 
journalism school. 
</P>
<P>
 All I could think of was how happy those old reporters would have been to have 
this double murder to cover.

AVIATION SHOW LURES THOUSANDS; VAN NUYS: THIS YEAR, MOST OF THE PLANES AT THE 
EXPO STAY FIRMLY ANCHORED TO THE RUNWAY. BUT FANS DON'T MIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Eight-year-old Kelly Reynolds scrambled aboard a massive KC-10 fuel tanker, 
buckled himself in, and pretended he was flying. Trying to imitate the sound of 
a jet engine, he roared and gurgled until his voice went hoarse. 
</P>
<P>
 A few feet away, 36-year-old Frances Whitten was also fixated on loud noise -- 
but she didn't have to dream up the sound of airplane engines. By her 
reckoning, she knows it all too well. 
</P>
<P>
 "So this is what has been keeping me up the last two nights," she said, 
surveying the Gargantuan Air Force plane. "That noise has driven me crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 She did not have much company though, among the thousands who flocked to the 
32nd Van Nuys Airport Aviation Expo on Saturday. Most of them appeared to 
relish the sound of airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear that sound?" Scott Livingston asked his 6-year-old son over the roar 
of a deafeningly loud C-130 cargo plane. "Huh? That noise? That noise is 
freedom. It's a treat to hear that sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Whitten, Livingston doesn't live in the neighborhood around the Van 
Nuys Airport. He lives in Big Bear. "I guess it's easier to like the noise if 
you don't live with it all the time," he admitted, glancing at his son, whose 
index fingers were jammed firmly in his ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials said because of complaints from neighbors such as Whitten in 
past years, this year's expo was actually much quieter than previous ones when 
not so supersonic jets performed aerobatic stunts over the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, most of the planes stayed firmly anchored to the runway, and the 
only in-air performances were a drop-in by the U.S. Army Golden Knights 
parachute team and a simulated rescue by a city of Los Angeles Fire Department 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the aviation buffs didn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, that you can't see (the planes) so well when they're in the air 
anyway," Felicity Cantrell said. But at the expo, with many planes open for 
visitors on the airport's runway, civilians were able to talk to pilots, climb 
aboard, and sometimes sit in the pilot seats of military aircraft including the 
B-1 bomber, AWACS Sentry, F-111 Aardvark, F-14 Tomcat and various other 
fighters, bombers and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular planes were the huge fuel tankers and the star of the Persian 
Gulf War, the F-117A Stealth Fighter -- which people had to view from about 15 
feet away because the high-tech fighter-bomber was roped off and guarded by an 
airman carrying an M-16. Asked if the weapon was loaded, the guard smiled and 
said: "Yup." 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Knights, who leap out of planes from upward of 5,000 feet, sent the 
crowd into paroxysms of joy, as most of the jumpers managed to land on the 
target they were aiming for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, those dudes are bad," said 13-year-old Caren Saunders of North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 By midday, as the temperature climbed past 90 degrees, Angie Diaz, 34, joined 
a crowd of others sitting under the wings of an F-15E Strike Eagle. The fighter 
travels up to 1,700 m.p.h., can fly at heights up to 60,000 feet, and carries 
missiles, 20-millimeter cannon, and either conventional or nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Diaz wasn't interested in all that. "What's the name of this one?" her 
daughter asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one," she responded wearily, "is called the shade plane." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, vendors sold a variety of military-themed products, ranging from 
T-shirts ("Mess With the Best, Die Like the Rest," said one, in praise of the 
Marine Corps), to military-style dog tags made to order. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the runway, the Optimist club sold beer, and pilots -- wearing aviator 
glasses and flight suits -- sat outside their aircraft, watching people watch 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is fun, just watching the girls go by," said one bomber pilot. "Thank 
God for summer." 
</P>
<P>
 The day began with Los Angeles city officials honoring several people for 
courageous deeds during the Northridge earthquake, all in keeping with the air 
expo's theme, "The spirit of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the honorees were residents of Wolfskill Street in Mission Hills who 
were praised by Councilman Richard Alarcon as "neighborhood heroes" for helping 
and comforting each other after an underground oil pipeline exploded and burned 
several houses on their street. 
</P>
<P>
 Also honored were Barry Pascal of Northridge, Police Department Lt. Stan Embry 
of the Van Nuys station, Paula Elefante of Reseda, Andy Epand of Studio City, 
Hank Fardel of Sherman Oaks, Van Nuys Airport air traffic controllers, 
California National Guard, and the California Air National Guard's 146th 
Tactical Airlift Wing, based at Channel Islands.

AS CHANGE OVERTAKES COMPTON, SO DO TENSIONS; COMMUNITY: LATINO PLURALITY SEEKS 
POWER. A GENERATION AFTER WINNING IT, BLACKS FIND BIAS CHARGES A BITTER PILL.

<P>
 Three decades ago, Compton's African American majority ousted the city's 
entrenched white leadership in a heated battle that reflected the social tumult 
of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, the tough city in south Los Angeles County was the most populous 
community west of the Mississippi where blacks held political sway, a national 
symbol of political empowerment despite its persistent poverty. Here, refugees 
from the Jim Crow South acquired their piece of the American Dream, using the 
ballot box to overcome discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a grainy video image of a black police officer beating a Latino teen-ager 
has given impetus to cries for a new political revolution.  
</P>
<P>
 This time, those alleging discrimination are Latinos -- now the presumed 
majority in an extraordinary demographic shift after the massive emigration 
from Mexico and Central America that accelerated in the early 1980s. The 
much-publicized allegations of racial prejudice have galvanized Latinos' 
demands for power in a city where blacks have a lock on city government, a 
beleaguered school system and most municipal jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is racism perpetuated by one minority group against another," said Pedro 
Pallan, a 60-year-old baker and unsuccessful council candidate who has been one 
of the most outspoken Latino advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar has created a besieged atmosphere in City Hall, polarized black and 
Latino leaders whose constituents have generally enjoyed cordial relations, and 
left African Americans in the ironic position of responding to allegations of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hard pill to swallow," said Police Chief Hourie L. Taylor, who is 
black. His 125-officer department, at the vortex of the swirling controversy, 
includes 14 Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton's embattled black leadership has responded angrily to the challenge, 
dismissing allegations of discrimination while characterizing Latino activists 
as a self-serving clique of non-resident merchants.  
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as a well-constructed attempt to utilize the historical 
implications of the African American civil rights movement for the benefit of a 
few people, who in fact probably don't even consider themselves nonwhite," said 
Mayor Omar Bradley, a 36-year-old high school English teacher and Compton 
native. "This is really all about power and privilege." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The black-brown dispute may provide a glimpse into the potential for future 
political upheaval in many Southern California communities where immigration 
has drastically altered the demographic mix. Compton is one test case in the 
politics of the new Southland, an indication of bumpy times ahead as newcomers' 
demands clash with established power blocs resistant to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite the supercharged rhetoric, some see an opportunity for 
cooperation and coalition-building. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to have a more inclusionary, larger political vision," said Joe 
R. Hicks, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of 
Greater Los Angeles, an African American civil rights group. "This is really an 
issue of poor folks struggling over jobs and opportunities. . . . Unless you 
have a vision of human relations as quite inclusionary, you end up circling the 
wagons, and lobbing hand grenades at each other in what is seen as racial or 
ethnic interest. We all lose in that scenario." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some African American clerics and others in Compton have called on 
politicians to open up their city to Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are today the entrenched group trying to keep out intruders, just as 
whites were once the entrenched group and we were the intruders," said the Rev. 
William R. Johnson Jr., pastor of Curry Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spearheading the call for political change is a vocal group of Latino leaders, 
mostly merchants, who have formed Latinos United Coalition of Compton, headed 
by Pallan, a longtime activist who has the most political experience. Also 
included in the organization are a grocery store owner, a juice shop operator, 
a real estate investor and a lawyer. Participants meet in the back room of a 
Mexican restaurant to discuss strategy, assisted by national Latino groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos are pressing several demands, including creation of a civilian board 
to review police behavior, a federal investigation into racial and ethnic 
conflict in the city, and establishment of an affirmative action and 
job-training program targeted toward increasing Latino participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Black officials have tended to paint the coalition as "outside agitators," in 
the words of several top city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnulfo Alatorre, one of the coalition leaders, acknowledges that he resides 
in nearby Downey, but adds that his Compton grocery store has been in business 
for years and that he lived in Compton for most of his life. He and other 
commuting businessmen view their presence in Compton as crucial to a city with 
high unemployment and a low tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alatorre and his allies face a major hurdle. The vast majority of Latinos 
are believed to be non-citizens and therefore unable to vote in elections 
dominated by the black middle class, including many civic-minded elderly who 
migrated from the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Latino coalition members, mostly U.S.-born and middle class, are 
more politically advanced than the immigrant population whom they seek to 
represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Among new immigrants, major concerns tend to focus on providing for families 
in an environment rife with gang warfare and street crime, and ensuring that 
their children get good educations in a school system lacking bilingual 
personnel and troubled by clashes between black and Latino high school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we live only to live," said Graciela Munoz, a mother of seven from 
Mexico, who was having an impromptu birthday celebration for a daughter at a 
fast-food emporium. "One feels useless; we're unable to participate."  
</P>
<P>
 For black leaders, that lack of participation is the true culprit -- not 
institutional discrimination by the African American power structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does the African American do to empower them (Latinos) when it's 
constitutionally illegal (for non-citizens to vote)?" asks Bradley. He sees his 
city caught in what he calls a virtual open-door immigration policy that is 
beyond local control. "As they continue to come, schools become crowded, (and) 
dwindling resources in cities such as Compton become more sparse. Animosity and 
friction (are) the natural product of these things, and that's what we're 
seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 census indicated that blacks made up 55% of Compton's population of 
93,500; Latinos accounted for 42%. Many believe that Latinos now represent a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 This diversity is hardly represented in City Hall, where several departments 
are almost entirely African American. Bradley and three of the four City 
Council members are black; the other is white. The mayor estimates that perhaps 
10-15% of the city work force of 600 is Latino, while up to 80% is black -- a 
fact that he and others attribute not to racism, but to low turnover among 
blacks and a longtime paucity of Latino applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged at being labeled bigots, city leaders see sinister forces behind the 
sudden public focus on the lack of Latino representation. They cite the cases 
of Huntington Park and other nearby, longtime overwhelmingly Latino cities that 
were run until recently by white minorities who seldom faced such scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black people are more vulnerable to criticism because we are held to a higher 
standard," said City Atty. Legrand Clegg. 
</P>
<P>
 However, demands for change come even from Latinos respected by Clegg and 
other black leaders, such as Gorgonio Sanchez, a longtime Compton resident who, 
as a member of the school board, is the city's only elected Latino official. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (blacks) have been in power for too long and they are in denial of the 
fact that they are no longer the majority," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Compton developed rapidly after World War II as a bedroom community. Tract 
homes built on the westside of town were open to blacks, making it one of the 
few suburbs where African Americans could own homes. The town remained strictly 
segregated: blacks clustered to the west, whites in the less densely populated 
eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1965 civil unrest in nearby Watts helped break the pattern of white 
domination. Soon fleeing in large numbers were whites, and to a lesser extent, 
Mexican Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1968, the power balance had shifted. Blacks gained control of the council 
and school board. African Americans also supplanted whites in jobs at City Hall 
and in the schools. Black leaders say this was a natural transition, as few 
whites or Latinos wanted to work in Compton, which was increasingly stigmatized 
as a high-crime, black city mired in poverty.  
</P>
<P>
 The city began changing again in the 1980s as the wave of immigration via the 
U.S.-Mexico border gained momentum. These new immigrants found Compton a 
convenient stop, with cheap rents and access to the then-booming Los Angeles 
job market. Signs in Spanish are proliferating along Compton streets; taquerias 
have replaced barbecue joints. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Compton's growing racial tensions might never have received national 
prominence if a resident had not videotaped black police Officer Michael 
Jackson beating 17-year-old Felipe Soltero on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Many blacks joined Latinos in condemning a Police Department that, critics 
say, too often relies on heavy-handed tactics against members of all races. 
(The killings of two Samoan brothers shot by a Compton police officer in 1991 
prompted Samoan representatives to charge police brutality.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have just as easily been a black man who was beaten like that," said 
Vicky D. Lindsey, an African American who was among those protesting recently 
outside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The police chief and other black leaders generally reacted cautiously to the 
videotape, reserving judgment on the officer's actions but downplaying 
potential racial motivations. They were enraged when Latino activists compared 
the incident to the beating that Rodney G. King suffered at the hands of white 
Los Angeles Police Department officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no outstanding history of black people beating Latinos," Bradley 
said. "Show me where one black man has burned a cross on a Latino's lawn." 
</P>
<P>
 But Latino leaders say the mayor himself has engaged in provocative hyperbole 
-- when he denounced Latinos for their lack of a public apology for 
Colonial-era Spaniards' involvement in the slave trade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among Compton's Latinos, perhaps nothing inflames passions as much the school 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 About 59% of the 29,000-pupil student body is Latino (compared to 39% black), 
yet only 5% of certified teachers are Latino (almost 72% are black).  
</P>
<P>
 African Americans occupy most administrative posts in the district, which was 
taken over by the state last year amid financial difficulties, persistently low 
test scores and widespread allegations of mismanagement. Some black leaders 
have expressed open hostility to bilingual education -- which many immigrant 
parents call a vital concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid there are children who aren't even learning to read or write 
because they don't understand English," said Concepcion Favela, a Mexican 
immigrant whose two children attend elementary school.  
</P>
<P>
 Maria Espinoza, a 15-year-old student at Compton High School, bemoans what she 
calls a misguided curriculum. "I know more about Africa than I do about my own 
culture, about Mexico," said Espinoza, who participated in one of the recent 
protests outside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators say they are doing the best they can. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Harold L. Cebrun blamed state textbooks for a lack of emphasis on 
Mexican culture and expressed a desire for more Spanish-speaking staff. "I'd be 
stupid to tell you I'm happy with the number of bilingual teachers," Cebrun 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of both races have expressed fears that the present tensions could 
carry over this fall to the city's high schools, where brawls between African 
American and Latino students last year disrupted learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to head off trouble, city officials and religious leaders have 
scheduled a "unity" rally for today.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to calm this down," said Father Marquis Clif, a priest at Our Lady of 
Victory Roman Catholic parish.  
</P>
<P>
 But the rally itself underlines community divisions. Representatives of the 
activist Latino coalition call the event a city-orchestrated effort to divert 
attention from Latino non-representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can have all the rallies they want, but it doesn't mean anything until 
they recognize there's a problem," said Lorraine Cervantes, a Latino coalition 
supporter. "Blacks are doing the same thing to Latinos that was done to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even amid Compton's highly charged atmosphere, there is some recognition that 
ways must be found to accommodate the city's new majority, though that could 
mean weakening hard-won African American control. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our wishing and all of our praying is not going to make these people 
(Latinos) go anyplace else," said Johnson, who has preached inclusion to his 
mostly African American congregation. "They are here, they're part of the 
community, so why not treat them like a part of the community?" Compton Profile 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the city of Compton: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ethnic background: City officials say Latinos now make up a majority of the 
population. According to the latest official figures, the city is 55% black, 
42% Latino, 1.8% Asian or Pacific Islander, 1% white, and 0.5% American Indian. 
But officials say Latinos were drastically undercounted.  
</P>
<P>
 * Full-time city employees, including police and fire (1992-93): 529. Ethnic 
background: 78.07% black, 10.78% Latino, 7.75% white, 3.21% Asian/Pacific 
Islander. 
</P>
<P>
 * Police force: 125 officers. Ethnic background: 73 blacks, 34 whites, 14 
Latinos, 4 others. 
</P>
<P>
 * Compton Unified School District: Ethnic background of students: 59% Latino, 
39% black, 2% other. 
</P>
<P>
 * Registered voters: 34,243; 17.98% voted in June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Median income: $25,699. Median value, single-family home in 1990: $108,000.

STORAGE SPACE SCAVENGERS BET ON BURIED TREASURES; AUCTIONS: IT'S USUALLY JUST 
RECYCLABLE JUNK. BUT SOMETIMES BIDDERS GET MORE THAN THEY BARGAINED FOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bidders had just a moment before the auction began to shine flashlight beams 
into a 5-by-7-foot rental storage room, looking on the outside of cardboard 
boxes for clues to their contents. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until top bidder Ed Zaharoff had loaded the containers into his van 
that he noticed small, jagged holes in the bottoms of his new, boxed 
belongings. And it wasn't until he started driving that he heard the screeches. 
</P>
<P>
 For $400, Zaharoff had become the proud owner of four boxes of rat families 
and the rags they called home. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaharoff is a "storage space scavenger," one of hundreds who travel from 
auction to auction, their hunting grounds the storage rooms abandoned by owners 
for at least 60 days. The scavengers are willing to bid thousands of dollars, 
hoping to find hidden treasures in someone else's leavings. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think they can get rich in this business," said Zaharoff, a six-year 
veteran of the blind auctions. "I'm still working at Ralphs. I haven't found a 
gold mine."  
</P>
<P>
 What Zaharoff did find last week, for $2,300 at an auction of rent-delinquent 
storage rooms in Northridge, were three badly decayed human bodies. While 
police continue to investigate the dead people's identities and their road into 
two steamer trunks and a box, Zaharoff and the other regulars continue to 
scavenge, hoping for luckier breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, they find boxes filled with people's lives: tattered 
clothing and cloudy dishes, reams of papers and household knickknacks. It's the 
sort of recyclable junk that might fetch a few dollars at a swap meet, enough, 
the treasure hunters hope, to at least reimburse them for their bid. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes they indeed find treasures, like the crayon box in a $400 room 
bought by Randi Cram of Whittier that hid a $4,000 Rolex watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The storage space auction game requires careful strategy. Labels can be 
deceptive; "crystal" can be a woman's name or it can be the fancy label given 
to regular kitchen drinking glasses packed in newspaper. Boxes with factory 
brand names cannot be counted on to contain those items; gamblers all have 
memories about sealed boxes that promised Sony TVs or Apple computers, but were 
simply empty boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something can look real good, and it ends up being the stuff of a bag man or 
something," said Zaharoff, who was refunded the $2,300 he paid for the three 
bodies. "Sometimes people don't know the value of something and they put it in 
storage. Happens all the time; that's what we hope for." 
</P>
<P>
 Myths of the trade -- both horrible and grand -- abound. Someone "back East" 
found a severed finger in a bag full of clothing. Someone "up North" paid $500 
for a room and discovered a priceless painting. 
</P>
<P>
 The storage business owners have their own stories about the things people 
leave behind. Mary Vincent of Personal Storage Garages in North Hollywood 
recalled that one night a worker heard a pained howl coming from a storeroom. 
Someone had locked a dog inside. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Lancaster storage business, a former gold miner and amateur pilot filled 
his rented space with an airplane fuselage and a wooden wing, then disappeared. 
Business owner Liz Cordova never found him, or the rest of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police, too, have tales about uses for the nearly ideal hiding 
spaces. They regularly seek warrants to search storage rooms and occasionally 
find what they are seeking: drug labs, pornography, counterfeit money and other 
contraband, said Detective Tom Broad of the LAPD's Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the regular storage-room gamblers -- the ones who daily scour the 
papers for auction listings, subscribe to resellers' newsletters and wear 
flashlights in their pockets and padlocks on their belts -- say they are 
looking only to come out a little bit ahead. From time to time, antique dealers 
acknowledge, they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they're going to find a Faberge Egg, but I do think the odds 
are pretty good that they'll find something worth $100," said Terry Kovel, the 
co-author of Kovels' Antiques and Collectibles Price List. "But they have to be 
smart enough to recognize it -- that's the key -- and then know how to sell 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Antique dealers derisively call the scavengers "pickers," because they are 
willing to sift through the take. The bidders prefer to call themselves 
resellers, treasure hunters or gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
 And they have their own hierarchy. They refer to neophyte pickers as "newbies" 
and hope to drive them out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 See someone who doesn't look familiar? Mutter loudly about a worthless room's 
good-looking haul, run the bidding high and then dump it on the newbie, leaving 
the newcomer with a room full of junk. 
</P>
<P>
 Spot a newbie struggling to load up heavy boxes? Let the person carry them 
out, then shout to friends about the great auction set to take place in 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition, the gamblers know, pushes the bidding higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Hickey Jr. of Canoga Park has only been at the blind auction game for 
about six months. He works nights as a printer and saves many of his days for 
bidding, hauling and reselling storage-room contents. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9:30 on a recent morning, he was ready to bid on the one unit up for grabs 
at a U-Haul self-storage in Whittier. The last payment on the 10-by-10-foot 
room had been made in May, the storage manager said, and attempts to contact 
the room's renter had been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickey and about six other treasure hunters gathered around for the 
auctioneer's usual pre-bidding speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash only. Personal photos and documents must be returned. No touching the 
room's contents. No going inside before the bidding. No refunds. No guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 When the manager opened the door, the gamblers gathered around it, training 
their lights on the booty: an old sewing machine, a rusty 10-speed bicycle, a 
mattress and the inevitable, but mysterious, boxes. In hopes the crates would 
contain items worthy of a swap meet, Hickey made the high bid, $350. 
</P>
<P>
 Peeking inside one, he spotted gift-wrapping. The others would remain unopened 
until he got home, another tenant of the scavenging game. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what you have, somebody will give you something for it, even if 
it's a nickel or a quarter," Hickey said. "It's only worth what somebody will 
pay for it."

VALLEY BRIEFING: HEAVY TRAFFIC; HOW CROWDED IS YOUR FREEWAY COMMUTE? TAKE A 
LOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the San Fernando Valley area contains 19.87%, or 105 miles, of Los 
Angeles County's 527-mile freeway network, it boasts a slightly higher 
proportion of overall traffic in the county -- 20.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, motorists rack up a whopping 6.4 billion miles on Valley-area 
freeways.That's 17.5 million miles -- or the equivalent of 37 round trips 
between the Earth and the moon -- every day. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one-quarter of those miles are logged on the 101 Freeway, the 
Valley's busiest. Between the Barham Boulevard and Valley Circle Boulevard 
exits, an average 258,000 vehicles travel daily, nearly the same number of 
vehicles in all of the African nation of Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 The least burdened freeway, the 210, supports only 79,000 vehicles a day. In 
the Fast Lane 
</P>

SUNDAY BRIEFING; AN OCCASIONAL LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY ISSUES; HOW SAN ONOFRE 
GENERATES POWER; ENERGY PRODUCED BY THE SAN ONOFRE NUCLEAR GENERATING STATION 
TOUCHES THE NEARLY 15 MILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE SOUTHLAND. THE TWO-UNIT 
PLANT CONTRIBUTES 18% OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY MIX. ADVANTAGES OF THE 
PLANT'S CONTRIBUTION ARE TEMPERED BY THEIR VERY SOURCE -- ATOMIC ENERGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inside the Nuclear Reactor 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of San Onofre is its nuclear reactor. It can produce vast amounts of 
energy from a small amount of fuel. How it's done: 1. Uranium atoms split 
(fission) inside fuel rods; occurs trillions of times per second, creating 
heat. 2. Water circulating inside reactor core is heated to more than 600 
degrees Fahrenheit. 3. Hot water passes through pipes into boiler and is 
converted to steam. Remaining water is pumped back to reactor to be reheated; 
cycle repeats. 4. Steam spins a turbine, which drives an electric generator. 5. 
Ocean water, pumped in from a separate pipeline, cools steam and turns it back 
into water. Ocean water is returned to sea. 6. Cooled water from condensed 
steam pumped back into boiler for reuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Not drawn to scale; only a portion of reactor is shown. How High-Level 
Radioactive Waste Is Stored 
</P>
<P>
 Nuclear fission results in low- and high-level radioactive waste. Low-level 
waste (worker clothing and tools, etc.) is shipped to licensed disposal sites 
in Nevada and Washington. High-level waste is stored at San Onofre. * Pools: 
Steel-lined concrete structures 45 feet deep High-level waste: Clusters of used 
fuel rods stacked in pools by machine Water: Fuel rods submerged into pools 
with at least 23 feet covering them; water cools used fuel rods, acts as 
protective shield for workers Multiple Safeguards 
</P>
<P>
 Uranium, the fuel used to produce nuclear energy, is naturally radioactive. 
San Onofre uses several physical barriers to prevent escape of radioactive 
materials. * Fuel pellets: 1/3-inch-diameter uranium pellets lock in 
radioactive by-products after fission Fuel rods: 12-foot stainless steel or 
metal tubes encase uranium pellets Reactor vessel: Fuel rods placed in 
8-inch-thick carbon steel vessel Steel containment: Vessel enclosed by 
leak-proof steel-plate shell Containment structure: Airtight, 4 1/2-foot-thick 
reinforced-concrete walls and 11-foot-thick concrete floor, houses reactor 
vessel and all equipment in direct contact with it Plant Particulars * 
Ownership: Primarily Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric; 
cities of Anaheim and Riverside own less than 5% of Units 2 and 3 * On line: 
Unit 1 began producing power Jan. 1, 1968. and shut down Nov. 30, 1992; Units 2 
and 3 began operating in August, 1983, and April, 1984, respectively. * 
Construction cost: Unit 1: $88 million. Units 2 and 3: $4.5 billion total * 
Current status: Units 2 and 3 operating with a capacity to serve 2.75 million 
households * Employees: 2,500-3,000 * Employee requirements: Security screening 
and psychological profiles, physical exams every two years; operators receive 
additional training and licensing by Nuclear Regulatory Commission. * Annual 
payroll: $120 million * Annual expenditures: $250 million, including property 
taxes, salaries and operating and maintenance expenses Edison's Energy Mix 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 years, nuclear power has gone from being Edison's least-used energy 
resource to being the third-largest. A Edison's sources: 1983 Other utilities: 
40% Gas: 33 Coal: 15 Hydro: 10 Non-utility energy: 1 Nuclear: 1 1993 
Non-utility energy: 34% Gas: 23 Nuclear: 18 Coal: 13 Hydro: 7 Other utilities:

kilowatt hour in 1993: Source: Cost Oil: 7.996 Gas: 2.930 Coal: 1.226 Nuclear: 
0.537 San Onofre's Future 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission's Division of Ratepayer Advocates 
has recommended that San Onofre be shut by 1998, 15 years ahead of schedule, on 
the grounds that it is too expensive to operate. Two public hearings before an 
administrative law judge were held in June. Judge will submit a report to the 
PUC, which is expected to decide the question later this year. * Opponents: Say 
it would be cheaper to shut San Onofre and use alternate energy sources like 
solar power and natural gas. (Proponents say San Onofre is cost-effective and 
will save its ratepayers at least $1 billion if allowed to operate through 
2013.) * Proponents: Believe plant infuses $250 million in annual revenue into 
surrounding communities and closure would further deflate an already sagging 
economy. (Opponents say the nuclear power industry is dead in this country and 
producing electricity through renewable resources will increase the number of 
local jobs tenfold.) Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down Advantages of nuclear power have 
long been weighed against health, safety and environmental concerns. Some pros 
and cons of nuclear energy: (Graphic: Pro) * Economics: One pound of nuclear 
fuel releases as much energy as does combustion of three million pounds of 
coal. (Graphic: Con) * By-products: Uranium produces radiation long after its 
use as a fuel for nuclear energy. Safe way to store uranium waste permanently 
has not been perfected. Nuclear Report Card Throughout each year, the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission evaluates plant operations at San Onofre and other 
nuclear plants. The evaluation rates the plant on a scale of 1 to 3 -- with 1 
being best -- in several categories, including plant operations and 
maintenance. In the past five reports, San Onofre has consistently rated above 
average. * 1987-88: 1.71 1988-90: 1.43 1990-91: 1.57 1991-92: 1.43 1992-94: 
1.50 Average Radiation Doses Exposure to radiation is a fact of everyday life. 
Most Americans receive about 300 millirem per year. A millirem is a small unit 
of radiation. It would take a dose of 50,000 millirem in one day to produce 
flu-like symptoms. Some common radiation exposures: * Source: Millirem Chest 
X-ray: 10 per X-ray Dental X-ray: 130 per full set High-voltage color TV*: 0.03 
per year Wrist watch: 0.03 per year Smoke detector: 0.03 per year Airplane trip 
from Los Angeles to London: 4 per round trip * Depending on age of set, 
distance from viewer Power Load 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of time San Onofre's two reactors are operating at full 
capacity has increased dramatically. Levels are higher if mandated shutdowns 
for maintenance and the like are discounted: * Unit 2

the Sirens Sound If an emergency occurs at San Onofre, long, steady sirens will 
sound for three to five minutes. If you hear an alert: * Keep calm: Sirens 
sound in time to react cautiously. * Tune in: Listen to local radio or TV 
station for news and instructions. * Neighbor check: Make sure neighbors heard 
the sirens and know what to do. * Avoid calls: Do not use the telephone unless 
absolutely necessary. Emergency workers need lines. Do not dial 911 except to 
report an immediate life-threatening emergency. * Indoor shelter: If advised to 
stay inside, close all doors and windows and shut off all systems that draw 
outside air into building. Keep pets inside if possible. * Evacuation: If 
advised to evacuate, leave the area promptly after turning off lights, 
appliances and water, locking windows and doors, and taking enough necessary 
personal items to last several days. Close all vents and windows in vehicle and 
do not use air-conditioner. * Family: Do not attempt to pick up or call 
children or family at schools, hospitals and the like. Public facilities follow 
their own emergency procedures. Glossary Background radiation: Radiation 
occuring naturally in the environment through light, heat and radio waves. 
Chain reaction: Continuous, self-sustaining series of fission reactions in a 
mass of uranium. Fission: To split or break an atom into two new atoms or 
fragments. Releases energy and produces heat used to boil water and make steam 
in steam generator. Half-life: Time required for half the atoms of a 
radioactive substance to decay into another substance. Kilowatt: A unit of 
power equal to 1,000 watts. Megawatt: A unit of power equal to 1 million watts. 
Nuclear radiation: High-energy particles and rays given off during a nuclear 
reaction. Nuclear reactor: Device producing nuclear energy by means of 
controlled chain reactions. Radiation: Form of energy that moves in waves or 
particles. * Sources: Southern California Edison, San Onofre Nuclear Generating

TUJUNGA MAN FOUND DEAD IN STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was found stabbed to death in the street early Saturday morning, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricardo Amilar Sandoval, 25, was found dead about 3:30 a.m. in front of his 
apartment building in the 7100 block of Greeley Street, said Los Angeles Police 
Sgt. Michelle Daniels. Sandoval had been stabbed in the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Carl Whiting said he believes Sandoval was stabbed after he got into 
an argument with one or more people as they were standing in front of the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably friends were involved in a dispute and things got out of hand," 
Whiting said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiting said Sandoval shared a Greeley Street apartment with two brothers and 
a cousin.

BLOW TO HEAD KILLS TEEN-AGER AT GAS STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A recent Grant High School graduate was killed by a blow on the head at a gas 
station at the corner of Sherman Way and Coldwater Canyon Avenue early Saturday 
morning, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 2:40 a.m., North Hollywood resident Hieu T. Luong, 18, was seen 
talking to two people at the Unocal service station, then closed, when 
witnesses heard a noise, which they described as sounding like a gunshot, said 
Los Angeles Police Detective Mike Coffey.  
</P>
<P>
 But Coffey said Luong's injuries were more characteristic of a blunt-force 
trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears he was hit in the head with something," Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police they saw Luong lying on the ground and the two people 
leaving the scene in two cars, one of them Luong's 1986 Toyota Celica. Luong, 
who lived with his parents a block from the gas station, was taken by ambulance 
to Holy Cross Medical Center, where he died of head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they have no description of the killers and no idea why they would 
kill Luong, a Vietnamese immigrant who worked in the Woodland Hills office of 
the Automobile Club of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't appear to be gang-related," Coffey said. "All the information that 
we had is that he was a good kid with a totally clean record. It just seems 
like he might have gotten into a dispute with somebody, but we don't know. His 
car is nothing that anybody would want." 
</P>
<P>
 The stolen car is a green two-door vehicle with California license plates, 
number 2CHT893. The killers were last seen driving south on Coldwater Canyon 
Boulevard, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luong had spent the evening with friends, going out to dinner and then to a 
pinball arcade on Sepulveda Boulevard, police said. He then dropped off his two 
friends at their homes, Coffey said, and was apparently on his way home when he 
was killed.

EXPERIMENTAL MINI-PLANT TO DESALINATE SEAWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Water District board has approved spending $800,000 for an 
experimental seawater desalination project at a Southern California Edison 
power plant here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a small facility, enough to fill four hot tubs," MWD spokesman Rob 
Hallwachs said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,000-gallon mini-plant, which was designed and built by the district's 
facility in La Verne, will be taken to Huntington Beach and should be running 
by the end of October, Hallwachs said. It will operate for one year on an 
experimental basis, but the water will not be fed into the public system. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost of the project is $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's far too expensive for such a small plant to hook it up to the water 
lines," Hallwachs said. "It's a test. For the next year we're not going to be 
putting that water into the drinking supply system." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the MWD hopes to build a 5,000-gallon plant, which would be the 
largest in the country, serving 10,000 households. Hallwachs did not rule out 
the possibility that the larger, permanent facility would be built in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 MWD General Manager John R. Wodraska said the district is committed "to 
developing cost-effective desalination, one of the alternatives we are pursuing 
to improve our region's water supply."

MAN INJURED IN DIVING ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Northridge man was hospitalized in critical condition Saturday after 
breaking his neck in a diving accident in Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Hermosillo, 22, and his friends were diving 30 feet off rocks into a 
shallow pond when Hermosillo was injured, according to Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Deputy Steve Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The pond, a popular swimming hole about 50 feet wide and 6 to 8 feet deep, is 
shallower than normal now due to scanty rainfall. It is located off Angeles 
Forest Highway about 20 miles northwest of La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermosillo was taken by Los Angeles County Fire Department helicopter to Holy 
Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident was reported at 6:50 p.m. Friday night. Sheriff's deputies 
blocked off the road while the helicopter lowered paramedics and supplies into 
the canyon, Anderson said. After lashing Hermosillo onto a backboard, 
paramedics placed him on a gurney, which was pulled up by the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a few of these accidents here," said Anderson. "Someone broke a leg 
about a month or two ago. Kids go out there and use it as a swimming pond."

POLICE DETONATE SYLMAR PIPE BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pipe bomb was detonated by the Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad 
early Friday morning after it was found in a residential neighborhood in 
Sylmar, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-inch bomb -- made out of PVC pipe with caps on both ends -- was found by 
a resident of the 12000 block of Bradley Avenue about 6 a.m., police 
said.Neither the resident's name nor the exact location of the bomb was 
released by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They evacuated the whole block for a few hours," said Officer Sandra 
Castello, adding that the pipe bomb was then taken and destroyed by the bomb 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was injured, police said. There are no suspects or motive in the case, 
and the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a string of these bombs being found in our division," said 
Lt. Joe Hiltner of the LAPD's Foothill Division. "This is just the latest."

TRAVEL BAN SOUGHT ON RAMS CORNERBACK; COURTS: PROSECUTORS SAY DARRYL HENLEY, 
WHO IS CHARGED WITH COCAINE TRAFFICKING, MIGHT FLEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors have asked a federal judge to block Rams cornerback Darryl 
Henley's attempts to play ball out of town, arguing that the player is a proven 
flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief filed Friday, prosecutors said Henley, who recently signed a 
one-year, $350,000 contract with the Rams, took measures to elude arrest for 
five weeks after his indictment on drug charges last October and is "fully 
capable of going into hiding" again. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Henley begins collecting paychecks and gaining economic stability, he also 
gains the financial ability to flee," prosecutors said in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 The player is accused of running a cross-country cocaine trafficking network 
out of his Brea home, using a former Rams cheerleader as a courier. His uncle, 
Rex Henley; a childhood friend, Willie McGowen, and three others also have been 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley is free on $200,000 bail while awaiting his Jan. 10 trial, but under 
the conditions of his release, he may not travel beyond the federal court's 
Central District jurisdiction, which includes seven Southern California 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Gary L. Taylor Tuesday to lift the 
restrictions to allow Henley to travel to nine out-of-town games with the team. 
They detailed Henley's travel plans and promised that he would be accompanied 
by teammates at all times. If Henley can't travel, his contract with the team 
could be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge is expected to review the requests this week.

MISS TEEN USA PUTS A SPECK ON THE MAP; YOUTH: TINY DESERT TOWN SWELLS WITH 
PRIDE OVER VICTORY OF SHAUNA GAMBILL, A CHEERLEADER AND STRAIGHT-A STUDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's probably less exciting to plan a parade when almost everyone involved 
lives within sight of each other but that was the only restraint on the 
jubilation in Acton last week, when a local girl won the national Miss Teen USA 
Pageant. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 people crowded into a Mexican restaurant in the block of rustic 
shops that is central Acton on Tuesday night, because it had a satellite dish 
that could get the real-time broadcast from the pageant in Biloxi, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Some viewers then ran home and videotaped the delayed network TV broadcast 
three hours later, watching Shauna Gambill's victory all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Shauna, 17, won her first beauty pageant at the age of 8 in Acton, a tiny 
desert community tucked against the north slope of the San Gabriel Mountains, 
about 10 miles south of Palmdale. Many residents watched her grow up into a 
blond, green-eyed cheerleader who earned straight A's and just kept winning 
local beauty pageants. 
</P>
<P>
 Many neighbors familiar with her string of successes said they never had a 
doubt about her chances, but Shauna said winning the crown was a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just (Miss) Georgia and I left up there" on stage at the climax of the 
competition, she said Friday. The runner-up was announced first, leaving Shauna 
the winner. "When they got to just the very beginning of the 'G,' I was just, 
'Yeowiee!' " she said. "I could not believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 She became the first Miss Teen California to win the national pageant in its 
30-year history. The title comes with more than $160,000 in prizes, including 
$60,000 in cash and a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, John Gambill, a Los Angeles Police Department sergeant, said his 
visit to a Century City accountant to discuss how to deal with her winnings and 
plan her financial portfolio "was like a slap in the face, realizing my 
daughter was all grown up." 
</P>
<P>
 Shauna's father returned home Friday but her mother, Laurette, a nurse at a 
Santa Clarita hospital, stayed with Shauna at a Beverly Hills hotel to go 
clothes-shopping for a photo session Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The pageant remained the dominant topic of conversation in Acton, a community 
of somewhere between 4,000 and 9,000 residents, depending on whom you ask. 
About 1,500 live near the center of town, but local officials' estimates of the 
population vary with how many of the surrounding hillside homes are considered 
part of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Acton residents are convinced that Shauna's victory will put the 
inconspicuous community on the map -- at least briefly -- but not all are sure 
they like the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now everyone's going to know where Acton is," remarked Nance Shierant, a 
three-year resident of the area. "I sort of liked it being isolated, away from 
everyone else. That's why I moved here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Siebert, president of the Acton Chamber of Commerce, said he doesn't mind 
a little publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a real estate broker, so that's good," he said. "We haven't overly 
promoted this community." 
</P>
<P>
 Locals tout the area as a place where a 5-acre ranch can be bought for the 
price of a small home in Los Angeles and outdoor lights are discouraged because 
they interfere with neighbors' views of the stars. The summer heat is 
punishing, but enough snow falls in the winter to occasionally block cars in 
their driveways. 
</P>
<P>
 Shauna has succeeded in virtually everything she's tried since the family 
moved from Simi Valley to Acton in 1984, according to those who know her. 
</P>
<P>
 She won the Little Miss Acton crown in 1985 and the Junior Miss Acton award in 
1990. She was one of four valedictorians this spring at Highland High School in 
Palmdale with a 4.62 grade-point average, as well as the school's senior 
homecoming princess and founding president of the Acton Leos Club, a Lions Club 
youth group. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager's run at the Miss Teen USA crown began in June of last year, 
when she won the Miss North Los Angeles County Teen USA competition. She was 
encouraged to enter by Shannon Mercier, 19, a longtime friend who competed in 
the Miss North Los Angeles County contest the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both won, and that was real exciting because we got to spend the whole 
year doing things together," said Shannon, who recently moved from Acton to 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Both competed for statewide honors and the right to represent California in 
their respective national pageants. Shannon didn't win, but Shauna did, earlier 
this year. That was when many of her friends saw the national title coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since she won California, I knew she had it," said Amy Murray, 18, the 
current Miss Acton and a friend of Shauna's since the third grade. "She's so 
perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 locals crammed into the Mexican restaurant Tuesday for the live 
broadcast of the pageant at 6 p.m., three hours before it was shown on regular 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was jubilant, even though few actually heard what was going on during 
the event because "anytime she just appeared on the screen, the place went 
ecstatic," said Vivian Oswell, aerobics coordinator at the Gym, where Shauna 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 Oswell rushed home after the victory cheers to tape the 9 o'clock broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen it four times now, and every time I've cried," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't the only one taping the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came into work the day after the pageant, there were six people who 
had videotaped it and it was being shown all over the building," said Highland 
High School Principal Jay Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Acton residents hope to throw a welcome-home bash for Shauna, complete with 
bands and local politicians. An impromptu parade has been mentioned as a 
possibility, although organizers are keeping mum because they are cool to the 
idea of shelling out $1,500 for a formal permit for such a small, casual event. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem with planning the celebration is that nobody is certain when 
Shauna will get time off from her new duties to attend. Much of her time over 
the next year will be planned through Miss Universe Inc., the pageant's 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Shauna said she hopes to return home Monday, for a short time at least, but 
last-minute schedule changes are always possible.  
</P>
<P>
 She said she intends to study law at UCLA and become an environmental 
attorney, although she probably will postpone plans to start college from 
January until her pageant duties are completed. But she feels her experience in 
the year ahead will more than make up for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 And she promises not to forget her small-town roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Acton has made me who I am today," she said. "It is such a positive 
environment to grow up in. I've got a good set of morals and values because of 
the community."

MAN ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was arrested while in church Saturday in connection with the shooting 
death of his wife in the couple's home more than a week ago, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Dale Pietz, 38, was arrested on suspicion of murder at a church on 
20th Street East and Avenue R in Palmdale at 4 p.m. Saturday, said Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department spokesman Sgt. Ron Spear. 
</P>
<P>
 TeriLynn Pietz, 38, was found shot to death Aug. 12 in the home she and her 
husband shared in the 37700 block of Cottonwood Street. At the time, Pietz told 
investigators that an acquaintance had entered his living room, shot his wife 
and fled. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors of the couple told detectives they had not seen the suspect, and 
authorities said Saturday that the man Pietz identified as the murderer could 
not have been responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently he told (detectives) he knew who the intruder was, but when they 
investigated, they found that the man was out of the state at the time of the 
shooting, " Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities declined to elaborate on the relationship between Pietz and the 
man he claimed was the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 A search of Pietz's home was conducted after his arrest, but sheriff's 
deputies would not say whether any evidence was found. The motive for the 
killing is still unknown, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pietz was booked at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station and was being held 
without bail.

THREE HURT IN TRAFFIC CRASH THAT CAUSES CHEMICAL SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A pool service truck involved in a three-vehicle collision spilled 15 gallons 
of potentially toxic chemicals onto a busy intersection Saturday, causing 
police to cordon off the area for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people were hurt in the collision, but no one was injured by the 
chemicals and authorities did not evacuate the area, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at 7:30 a.m. at Atlanta Avenue and Newland Street when 
the pool service truck, driven by 27-year-old Martin Mota of Lake Forest, ran a 
red light and hit a car, authorities said. Mota's pickup truck was flipped onto 
its side, spilling 15 gallons of chlorine and muriatic acid on the road, police 
Lt. John Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mota's truck was headed north on Newland when it collided with a car driven by 
Lisa Burroughs, 30, of Huntington Beach, who was headed east on Atlanta, Arnold 
said. The two vehicles then struck another car in the intersection, driven by 
Hana Rada, 46, of Laguna Niguel, Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a Huntington Beach hazardous materials crew and 12 fire units two 
hours to clear the area and free Mota and Burroughs, who were trapped in their 
vehicles, said Battalion Chief Steve Parker of the Huntington Beach Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The hazardous materials team neutralized the combination of chlorine and 
muriatic acid, a commercial term for hydrochloric acid, by spraying water and 
soda ash on the spill, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The common pool chemicals were in a concentrated form and could have formed a 
harmful gas cloud if not neutralized immediately, Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mota suffered head and chest injuries in the crash and was airlifted to UCI 
Medical Center in Orange. Burroughs, who suffered head and back injuries, was 
taken to the same hospital by ambulance. Rada was taken to Hoag Memorial 
Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach with minor injuries, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mota and Burroughs were in stable condition late Saturday. Rada's condition 
was not available.

DOMESTIC DISPUTE LEADS TO STANDOFF WITH SWAT TEAM

 A domestic dispute between a mother and son escalated into a 4 1/2-hour 
standoff between the son and a Sheriff's Department SWAT team Saturday morning, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident, which ended when sheriff's negotiators 
talked 30-year-old Harold Chaplin Fuller into surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation began at 7:15 a.m., when Fuller barricaded himself in his 
garage after his 72-year-old mother, Inez Fuller, called 911 to report an 
assault, said Sheriff's Lt. William Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis said the two were apparently arguing in their home in the 23000 block 
of Plant Avenue over a child custody issue when Harold Fuller hit his mother 
with a planter box, injuring her slightly, and threatened her with a 
.22-caliber handgun.  
</P>
<P>
 When Fuller went into the garage, his mother locked the door behind him and 
escaped through a side door, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies arrived with a special weapons and tactics team and a 
hostage negotiation team, Francis said, prompted by threats Fuller made to his 
mother to kill any officers who tried to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a bomb squad was brought in when Fuller told deputies he "had enough 
explosives to blow up three houses," Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostage negotiation deputies talked with Fuller by telephone, Francis 
said. They persuaded him to surrender 4 1/2 hours after the incident began. 
</P>
<P>
 They discovered "only some gun powder," a knife, the handgun and an 
inoperative .22-caliber rifle, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller was being held on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and 
resisting arrest at County Jail.

Libertarian Thomas E. Reimer of Orange and Republican Rob Hurtt, the incumbent, 
of Garden Grove. "Three Strikes" Crime Law 
</P>
<P>
 Chessen: "I favor 'three strikes.' It's a giant step toward telling criminals 
that there are mandatory consequences for breaking the law. I think there 
should be penalties at least as stringent for all crimes and, in some 
instances, I favor 'one strike and you're out.' There certainly are other 
avenues we should pursue as well in the war against crime. I support crime 
prevention, education, rehabilitation and more police on the street. But none 
of it works without enforcing stricter penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 Reimer: "The 'three strikes' initiative has many flaws in it. The basic reason 
for even proposing it is because most everyone is frustrated by our legal 
system. We have an inconsistent system of punishment and retribution whereby 
violent crime is punished less severely than victimless crime. If a murderer 
would be sentenced, and no parole given except in unusual cases, we wouldn't 
need a 'three strikes' initiative. One 'strike' would be enough as determined 
by a court. Crimes with victims should require compensation to the victims and 
their families by the perpetrator." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt: "In the Legislature, I was a co-author of AB 971, the 'three strikes' 
measure signed by the governor. I also fully support Prop. 184, the 'three 
strikes' measure that will appear on the ballot. Critics who contend we cannot 
afford this new law have been proven wrong. The Office of Planning and Research 
estimates the 'three strikes' law will save the state $23 billion by keeping 
dangerous felons off the streets, where they were costing society lives and 
dollars. Additionally, I released a report itemizing how we can incarcerate 
more prisoners, saving billions of dollars." Save Our State Initiative to 
Curtail Benefits to Illegal Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Chessen: "I am sympathetic to the SOS proposal. Like many Californians, I am 
concerned that full implementation could increase public health risks and hurt 
innocent children. I am also concerned the measure could jeopardize billions of 
dollars in federal funds. However, it is my belief that the full SOS initiative 
will never be completely implemented. By the time it is sorted through the 
courts and the federal government, some of the provisions will be modified or 
thrown out. . . . The SOS measure will put the issue on the front burner and 
force the Legislature and the federal government to meet their 
responsibilities. For that reason, I am inclined to support it." 
</P>
<P>
 Reimer: "I am opposed to the SOS initiative. The purpose is to eliminate the 
cost due to illegal immigration. This may not be accomplished according to some 
studies. It will become discriminatory and helps promote animosity toward other 
nationalities. . . . The best way to settle this problem is to eliminate the 
welfare state. Encouraging people to receive benefits and entitlements causes 
poorer people to leave their country and come here only to collect from our 
system. This country was founded on a moral work ethic where anyone can become 
successful. I see nothing wrong with a more open border policy provided we 
require people to support themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt: "I am fully supportive of Prop. 187, the SOS initiative, because it is 
the only way the people of California can express to the federal and state 
government that illegal immigration must stop. The initiative route is the 
final one we can take, as the federal government has failed to relieve this 
mandate. Granted, this isn't the only wasteful spending in our government, but 
it is a good place to begin reforming how our valuable tax dollars are spent." 
Single-Payer Health Initiative 
</P>
<P>
 Chessen: "The single-payer plan on the ballot includes massive tax increases 
for businesses and wage earners; I can't support that. I would support health 
care reform that provides all citizens with access to basic coverage without 
jeopardizing broader coverage for people who want it. No matter what the health 
care proposal, however, we must demand that it produce better coverage, not 
additional bureaucracy and paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
 Reimer: "A single-payer health plan is a giant step toward socialism. The 
private sector has been proven to provide more service for the dollar than any 
government bureaucracy ever has. We definitely have flaws in the system. One 
problem is a legal system overburdened by medical lawsuits. If we could 
encourage binding arbitration wherever possible, it would help. Another problem 
is deductibility of insurance premiums is allowed only for corporations and 
large businesses, not for an individual or self-employed person. Perhaps the 
biggest problem is the lack of competition in the medical establishment. . . . 
If more people bought their own insurance and paid for their own care, they 
would be more responsible and selective in services." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt: "I strongly oppose Prop. 186. This is perhaps the single most 
destructive initiative to ever appear on our ballot. The tax increase for this 
socialized system would be $40 billion -- the largest tax increase in any 
state's history. It is estimated that the payroll tax increase alone would cost 
California 300,000 lost jobs over the next four years. By socializing medicine 
and insuring everyone, regardless of legal residency, California would become a 
magnet for the uninsured sick for the entire country, and perhaps world. Our 
health care system is not broken, so don't 'fix' it." Future Uses for El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Chessen: "I support anything that would have the greatest ability to create 
jobs and turn around our economy. I hope we can develop a new commercial 
airport and protect the rights of neighboring residents and local taxpayers 
while creating new jobs, businesses and revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Reimer: "The El Toro base gives us an excellent opportunity to make Orange 
County a more productive area, and to help California business in general. . . 
. I would like to see the land sold to private interests, for they would 
develop it more profitably with the best use of the land than any government 
bureaucracy would. A master plan suggested by local governments, including a 
commercial and/or private airport, is the best way to achieve this." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt: As a state legislator, I have no jurisdiction over this matter. 
However, as a local business owner, I feel the (commercial airport) idea has 
merit. This option should not be ruled out, as there could be great benefits to 
Orange County in terms of long-term business development and job creation 
opportunities. This project will ultimately have a major impact on our county's 
future and we must make the best decision possible as we plan to strengthen 
Orange County's role as an economic powerhouse in the next century."

DESTINATION: POLAND; THE SCHINDLER'S LIST TOUR; A JOURNEY, INSPIRED BY 
SPIELBERG'S HOLOCAUST FILM, THROUGH THE REMNANTS OF JEWISH LIFE IN POLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.S. , Schnedler is travel editor of the Chicago Sun-Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind Shimon Holzer, the last Jewish man in Nowy Sacz, stretched the cemetery 
wall, built as a memorial after World War II from broken tombstones that the 
Germans had uprooted to pave the streets in this southern Polish town. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside the stocky factory worker stood 10 solemn Americans, the Jews among us 
reciting the Kaddish -- the ancient Hebrew prayer of mourning -- at the grave 
of his father, Kalman Holzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very important to Shimon, because he doesn't know the words of the 
Kaddish himself, and there's nobody else to pray for his father," said tour 
leader Stu Feiler. A Chicagoan who lost more than 30 relatives in the 
Holocaust, Feiler was spurred by Steven Spielberg's Academy Award-winning movie 
"Schindler's List" to organize several "Oskar Schindler's Poland" tours such as 
the one we joined in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft-spoken Holzer had steered us across the wet morning grass, stopping 
at monuments inscribed in Yiddish, and sometimes in Polish, as well. Erected 
for the most part since democracy took hold in Poland five years ago, they 
memorialize some of the 5,000 Nowy Sacz Jews executed by Nazi firing squads in 
the centuries-old cemetery or deported to the gas chambers of the Nazi death 
camp in Belzec. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were nine synagogues in Nowy Sacz in 1939," Holzer told us through an 
interpreter. "Jews made up a third of the 15,000 population back then. About 20 
surviving Jewish families returned after the war. Some went to Israel in 1956, 
and the others to Sweden and Australia in 1968." 
</P>
<P>
 That slender remnant of survivors departed their native Poland, he said, 
"because the Jewish people were not liked here. But it doesn't make a 
difference to me." 
</P>
<P>
 So Holzer remains, along with one Jewish woman still living in Nowy Sacz, now 
a pollution-shrouded industrial city of 75,000. He tends to his ailing Roman 
Catholic mother, who hid his Jewish father at home during the five years of 
German occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Holzer emigrated to Israel in the '60s, but came back because of bad 
health and died here in 1984 at age 78. Only when the occasional Jewish 
visitors come to Nowy Sacz from Israel or America can the proper prayer be said 
for his soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Deserted Jewish cemeteries, with their haunting echoes of a venerable 
civilization snuffed out overnight, became one leitmotif of our 11-day tour. 
And "Oskar Schindler's Poland" proved to be an emotionally wringing crash 
course in a vibrant culture that all but vanished in a five-year blink of the 
eye beneath the barbarity of Adolf Hitler's Final Solution. 
</P>
<P>
 In Krakow, the trip's hub, we even met a startling apparition -- a Holocaust 
survivor who believes she is the true-life incarnation of a character killed 
off in the movie version of "Schindler's List." Roma Ligocka, a 55-year-old 
painter of ineffably sorrowful portraits with bottomless eyes much like her 
own, believes she was the little "Girl in the Red Coat," the powerful lone 
color image used amid Spielberg's black-and-white footage to pinpoint Oskar 
Schindler's conversion from war profiteer to savior. 
</P>
<P>
 A morning's excursion to "Schindler's List" locations in and around Krakow, 
enlightened by Spielberg production consultant Franciszek Palowski, spotlighted 
the movie's heartening tale of courage and rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of us were inspired enough to see the film again the next afternoon (with 
Polish subtitles, for $1.80, in a sweltering Main Market Square cinema with no 
air-conditioning). 
</P>
<P>
 But our long day at Auschwitz-Birkenau, 30 miles west of Krakow, painted the 
full canvas of the Holocaust in deepest black with vignettes such as these: 
</P>
<P>
 * Two tons of human hair, turned gray by the Zyklon B gas before it was shorn 
from the freshly asphyxiated victims, to be sold for carpet padding and coat 
lining in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * An entire gallery of shoes, some of the 40,000 pairs found when Soviet 
troops reached Auschwitz in January, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another room containing heaps of battered suitcases with their owners' names 
chalked hopefully on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 * The hulking ruins of five huge gas chambers and crematories, the killing 
machines of the Nazi inferno. 
</P>
<P>
 * The slippery feel of the slivered human bones that can be found in almost 
any handful of dirt scooped up near several cloudy ponds still clogged with the 
ashes of men, women and children gassed and burned at a pace that sometimes 
reached 20,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven hours inside Nazi Germany's most prolific death factory hammered home 
the message that the "Schindler's List" saga -- as true and inspirational as it 
surely is -- ranks as an extreme exception to the rule. For the overwhelming 
majority of Jews who fell under the swastika's shadow, the bottom line was 
death by disease, starvation, slave labor, torture, shooting or gassing. 
</P>
<P>
 Oskar Schindler saved 1,300 Jews. Close to 6 million other Jews -- roughly 
half of them Polish citizens -- perished in the Holocaust. At 
Auschwitz-Birkenau, we gazed into the heart of that darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, half the 15 million Jews in the world today (including many 
Americans) are believed to have ancestral roots of some kind in present or 
former Polish soil. In 1939, there were 3.5 million Polish Jews -- a full 10% 
of the national population, comprising Europe's largest Jewish community. When 
the war ended in 1945, about 250,000 remained alive. In Poland today, estimates 
of the Jewish population range from 5,000 to 15,000, well under 1% of the 
prewar total and mostly age 70 or older. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like going to Pompeii," said tour colleague Bob Denlow, a St. Louis 
lawyer whose parents managed to survive the Holocaust. "You're walking past 
buildings still standing from an ancient civilization where all the people are 
long gone. But here, the people disappeared only 50 years ago. It's a ghostly 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who'd done some homework expected to encounter ghosts aplenty on 
the tour, especially during our three days on the road stopping at Nowy Sacz 
and a dozen other towns east of Krakow that boasted thriving Jewish communities 
before the war. As we heard from Joachim Russek, a professor at Jagiellonian 
University's 8-year-old Research Center on Jewish History and Culture in 
Poland, "this entire country is a vast Jewish cemetery." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it was an eye-opening surprise to discover that Poland's Jewish heritage 
has become a highly marketable commodity here, notwithstanding the virtual 
absence of flesh-and-blood Jews. This Jewish chic is thanks in substantial 
measure to "Schindler's List," seen so far by about a million Poles among the 
box-office total of more than 75 million worldwide, but also for reasons that 
predate the movie's powerful impact since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a half-dozen or more brands of kosher vodka have come on the 
market in Poland since 1990 -- including one with a dim-witted label that 
portrays a hook-nosed Jew much like the hateful stereotype propagated by the 
Nazis. Primary customers for this rising tide of kosher vodka, we were told, 
are Polish yuppies who serve it at parties as a fashionable flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 A more salutary development is Krakow's Jewish Culture Festival, which staged 
its fourth annual potpourri of films, concerts, exhibits and seminars two 
months ago. And Russek's research center recently signed an agreement with New 
York University to bring American students to Krakow starting next summer for 
an intensive Jewish studies program. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tourism front, the Kazimierz neighborhood -- a bustling hub for 
Krakow's 65,000 prewar Jews -- boasts three Jewish-themed cafes. Two are fierce 
side-by-side competitors, both claiming the name Ariel and both presenting 
Yiddish folk music, usually performed by non-Jews. The third, Cafe Sara, is 
housed at the Jewish Cultural Center, which opened last November with U.S. 
funding in a former prayer house. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same Szeroka Street square as the two Ariels, the Jordan bookshop sells 
not only guidebooks and souvenirs but also two-hour escorted tours of locations 
from "Schindler's List," which Spielberg shot mainly in Krakow from March 
through May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Krakow is famous because of this wonderful film," Russek said. "But 
'Schindler's List' will be a great victory only if people who see it are 
impelled to go to the library and learn more. It will be a small disaster if 
people see the film and say, 'Now I know all about the Holocaust.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Holocaust learning curve spanned a wide spectrum among our group -- from 
Bob Denlow and his non-Jewish wife, Pat, who'd both prepared extensively for 
their mission of tracing his relatives' Holocaust fate, to Mary Randall, an 
Alabaman who said she'd never known any Jews until this trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We credited Feiler with putting together a compelling tour, especially the 
unfailingly superb experts he lined up to brief us. But his overbearing, 
know-it-all style of leading the group became increasingly frustrating as the 
trip went along. Sometimes he seemed to forget that we were his paying 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 All this added a subtext of personal tension to a trip that would have been 
emotionally demanding under any circumstances. Still, the overall experience 
was intensely stimulating, and we had Feiler's vision to thank for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Feiler is propelled by a strong sense of extended-family loss, as became 
evident on the first morning's excursion to Jewish Krakow with well-versed 
guide Renata Zwodzijasz, who'd done graduate work a decade ago at the 
University of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We visited Poland's oldest Jewish cemetery (1552), located behind Remuh 
Synagogue on Szeroka Street, and then the New Jewish Cemetery on Miodowa 
Street, where Feiler showed us the tomb of his great-grandfather. The marker 
lay toppled beneath another stone in the crazy-quilt jumble of grave markers 
that German troops used for target practice when Krakow was the seat of Hans 
Frank's notorious occupation government for the shank of Poland not annexed to 
the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 We also passed the weed-choked vacant lot on Kupa Street where the house of 
Feiler's great-grandparents once stood. In the same block rises the shell of 
Ajzyk (Isaac) Synagogue, one of seven surviving in Krakow (although only Remuh 
is active, with 180 Orthodox members but no resident rabbi). The Germans 
torched Ajzyk's interior, and a dearth of funds has halted restoration of its 
exquisite wall paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour's 400-mile eastward loop from Krakow turned up disused synagogues in 
various states of disrepair. Some were as mournful as the cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tarnow, scene of the first deportation to Auschwitz in June of 1940, we 
found only the towering bimah (the raised central pulpit) standing at the Old 
Synagogue, which was dynamited and burned by the Germans on Nov. 11, 1939. A 
plaque at the 
</P>
<P>
 entrance to Tarnow's Jewish Cemetery reported: "The original gates to this 
cemetery, through which thousands of Jews were marched to be executed, are on 
display at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing special about Rzeszow's two former synagogues, one housing 
municipal offices and a small museum, the other used as an art gallery and 
cafe. But the 17th-Century synagogue in Lancut (pronounced "wine-soot") dazzled 
us with its sumptuous decoration -- a vision of all the splendor wiped out by 
the Germans in their zeal to desecrate the Jewish faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the best-preserved synagogue in Poland, according to Feiler, Lancut was 
saved from demolition by a civic crusader after the war and restored to its 
present majesty. 
</P>
<P>
 The richly hued stucco and polychrome motifs include Hebrew prayers, signs of 
the zodiac, scenes of religious feasts, animals and plants, and Old Testament 
tales. The inside of the bimah dome is painted with a leviathan -- a fantastic 
giant fish curled to swallow its own tail. We saw nothing more glorious 
anywhere on the tour than this synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Lancut's Jewish cemetery is a wasteland of tumbled tombs, some 
barely protruding from the ground. Here and at the next cemetery, in Lezajsk, 
the only spruced-up section surrounds the tombs of several revered Hasidic 
rebbes (rabbis) from past centuries. Hasidic donations have financed the 
mausoleums built in recent years to shelter the graves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We began to go numb the second day out from the flow of similar sights: 
another haunting Jewish cemetery in Sieniawa; a former synagogue used as an art 
school in Jaroslaw, with Hitler graffiti on the wall outside; an upper-class 
cemetery in Przemysl, where one ex-synagogue functions as a bus-repair depot; a 
16th-Century Sephardic synagogue, built like a fortress with walls five feet 
thick, in Lesko. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Rymanow hit us with a synagogue as melancholy as Lancut's was 
magnificent. We climbed over a low wire fence to inspect the ruins left by Nazi 
vandalism: the roof blown off and mostly open to the sky; the bimah severely 
damaged; fragments of murals dimly visible, including one of the Western Wall 
in Jerusalem. Here, indeed, was a place to wail with grief. 
</P>
<P>
 The repertoire varied in Szebnie, where our bus driver located the site of an 
SS forced-labor camp where 14,000 prisoners died from 1941 to 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign describing the camp is posted on the apartment building and grade 
school now on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The moving cemetery encounter with Nowy Sacz's last Jewish man was followed by 
a final synagogue stop in Bobowa at a wood-facaded temple built for an 
18th-Century Hasidic rebbe. The weathered wood cottages on the neighboring 
block struck Pat Denlow as exactly the kinds of homes from which the Jewish 
residents of so many Polish towns were brutally dragged when the Nazis began 
the deportations to the ghettos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Krakow, at the university Jewish research center, Joachim Russek 
helped focus our tangled thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the center is run mainly by non-Jews like him, Russek observed 
that "it's difficult to meet a Jew in Poland without a special effort. That's a 
reflection of the statistical picture. The Jewish community in Poland is 
essentially gone, so we concentrate on preserving the memory of their culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Russek addressed the issues of Polish anti-Semitism, which has surfaced in 
election campaigns here since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have invented anything along these lines in recent years," he said 
wryly, "it is anti-Semitism without Jews." But he expressed hope that programs 
like the center's could help bridge the gaps of understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we watched a marvelous video, "The Unexpected Guest," illustrated with 
paintings from a recent exhibition of Polish art depicting Jewish subjects over 
the centuries. After World War II, the narrator noted, the Poles had their own 
3 million dead to mourn. It was easy to move into an empty Jewish apartment and 
forget who had lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 That brought to the screen the portrait of "The Unexpected Guest," a man 
anxiously pushing open a door. And the narration: "Inside, he will find 
strangers. His descendants are missing . . . In a way, Poles and Jews have 
always been strangers. Yet they fit together like adjacent pieces of a puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
 Our extraordinary tour ended with more puzzles than answers. "In the United 
States, you are an enormously privileged people," Russek had told us. "You can 
afford to think about tomorrow more than yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Overloaded with images and impressions, we would go home prepared to do a lot 
of thinking. GUIDEBOOK Oskar Schindler's Poland 
</P>
<P>
 Schindler's List tours: Space remains on this year's final two "Oskar 
Schindler's Poland" tours led by Stu Feiler, creator of the program. Departure 
dates are Sept. 18 and Oct. 19 for the 12-day package, priced at $1,750 per 
person, double occupancy, including round-trip air fare between Chicago and 
Warsaw on KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, with express-train connections between 
Warsaw and Krakow. More tours are planned for 1995, but dates and prices have 
not been set; it is possible that someone other than Feiler will lead next 
year's trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the price are seven nights at the Hotel Orbis Holiday Inn, a 
comfortable hotel with casino on the outskirts of Krakow. One night is spent at 
the Sieniawa Palace, an 18th-Century baroque mansion, and one night at the 
serviceable Beskid Hotel in Nowy Sacz. Most meals are included, as well as 
touring transportation, and the excellent guides and experts arranged by 
Feiler. The group stays one night in Amsterdam on the return trip to the United 
States. A brief tour of the former Warsaw Ghetto is offered on arrival in 
Poland. 
</P>

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: NO MORE BIG CRUISE LINERS TO GALAPAGOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foreign cruise ships have been banned from dropping anchor at the Galapagos 
Islands and sending their passengers into the ecologically sensitive 
archipelago made famous by Charles Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although two cruise ships -- Cunard's Vistafjord and Paquet French Cruises' 
Mermoz -- were allowed to visit the Galapagos for the first time early this 
year, the Ecuadorean government in May decreed a three-year prohibition on all 
foreign commercial cruise ships, regardless of size. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling does not apply to Ecuadorean vessels, including the many smaller 
boats and ships that take tourists on one- to 10-day cruises around the 
Galapagos. However, even the Ecuadorean cruise ships cannot exceed 90 
passengers, according to Sylvia Moncayo of Quito-based Metropolitan Touring, 
the largest tour operator in Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
 The cruise-ship ban has won the support of environmentalists who say that 
large numbers of tourists would overwhelm the fragile ecosystem of the 13 major 
islands and hundreds of smaller ones that make up Galapagos National Park. 
(Already, a maximum of 50,000 tourists are permitted to visit the islands 
annually, and the park authority allows only one ship at a time to call at any 
Galapagos port.) Although the cruise industry is always on the lookout for new 
and exotic destinations, few tourists actually have cruised to the Galapagos on 
foreign liners. Most travelers fly to the islands and then board the small 
cruisers. However, the ban has forced one cruise line -- the Hanseatic -- to 
make some last-minute changes in plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hanseatic was scheduled to cruise the Galapagos for three nights and four 
days as part of a Nov. 3 sailing that will depart from Caracas, Venezuela, 
cross through the Panama Canal and end in Guayaquil, Ecuador. "In fact, the 
Galapagos was the main reason for booking the cruise," said a Hanseatic 
spokeswoman. The Hanseatic will now tie up in Guayaquil while passengers fly to 
the Galapagos and tour the islands. Letters have gone out to those holding 
reservations alerting them to the change in plans.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: SANTA MONICA; HEAT WAVE HOTEL; IT WASN'T A GLITCH-FREE STAY, 
BUT A ROOM BY THE BAY WAS A PERFECT WAY TO BEAT THE SOARING MERCURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Hubler writes for The Times Metro section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's the image of the quintessential California summer, and then there is 
the blistering reality. The former can be found daily at your favorite breezy 
beach town. The latter is available now in our back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 We live in Whittier, a placid community with one recurring flaw: Summer there 
is hotter than heck. The sun shimmers. The baby whines. The dog pants under the 
orange tree. Run the sprinklers, crank up the fans, crawl in and out of the 
pool -- it's all in vain.  
</P>
<P>
 So naturally, as the mercury began to climb this July, it was time once again 
for our annual conversation about how great it would be to rent a beach house 
-- except that the last two times we rented beach houses, the mattresses were 
mildewed and the kitchens smelled like cigarettes and beer. 
</P>
<P>
 So this year, we tried a different tack: a weekend instead of a week, a nice 
beach hotel instead of an oceanfront shack. Which was how we ended up at 
Shutters on the Beach, one of Southern California's nicest -- and newest -- 
beachfront hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Shutters is the latest luxurious offering from the former owners of the 
Beverly Hills Hotel. Situated on the sand in Santa Monica at the western end of 
Pico Boulevard, it is a homey-looking edifice of shingles, balconies and 
clapboard, painted a fresh gray with white trim and bedecked with pots of 
flowers and jacaranda trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole 186-room, 12-suite setup is scarcely more than a year old, but its 
neighbors must by now feel it has been around forever. By the time it opened 
last June, the hotel had been under construction for more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was completed in June, 1993, when the owners, hoteliers Edward and Thomas 
Slatkin, threw open a set of door-sized shutters to admit a throng of invited 
guests. Since then, the hotel has steadily gained in reputation and prestige 
(Dustin Hoffman was spotted there during World Cup week). With room rates that 
range $225-$325 (suites run from $550 to $1,800), it bills itself as "Los 
Angeles' only beachfront luxury hotel," and the appointments are breathtakingly 
lovely. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobby features two working fireplaces; shelves and shelves of good books; 
deep, comfy couches and a bank of French doors that open onto a balcony and a 
view of Santa Monica Bay as you have never seen it before. Blue waves, white 
sea foam, brown sand, bright sailboats. The beach hasn't looked this good since 
your dad learned to surf. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rooms, too, have a fresh, crisp feel that is almost more Cape Cod than Los 
Angeles. There are big four-poster beds and pristine linen duvets, and a spa 
tub -- complete with candles! -- in every bathroom, not to mention the standard 
luxury accouterments (mini bars, VCRs, marble-topped sinks, toiletries, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
 But if our recent July weekend at the hotel is any indication, Shutters still 
has some pretty aggravating kinks to work out, some of them correctable, others 
not so easily solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of Shutters' more intractable problems has to do with its 
location. Yes, it is on the beach (the paved boardwalk running along the sand 
from the Santa Monica Pier to the Venice border meanders just in front of the 
hotel), and the beach looks inviting from inside. But step outside, and it's a 
classic case of bait and switch: Your beachfront hotel is on one of the most 
polluted stretches of water in all of Los Angeles County, hard by the mouth of 
the Pico-Kenter storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
 True, recent improvements have diverted much of the polluted street-runoff 
water that comes down Pico-Kenter to the Hyperion Treatment Plant, but it's 
still a storm drain and you don't want to swim in it or sunbathe next to it -- 
especially with all those DANGER signs posted around warning people in not one 
but two languages that the bacteria counts in the water are hazardous to their 
health. Also, the hotel boasts that it is in the heart of bustling Santa 
Monica, with all the cultural and civic pleasures that implies. The swanky Main 
Street shopping district and the funky Third Street Promenade are each within a 
10-minute walk. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you actually are planning to walk, the streets that lead to those 
destinations are only a shade or two more wholesome than Skid Row after dark. 
Even the boardwalk, once we got beyond the hotel grounds, was littered with 
trash and human excrement. The area around the Santa Monica Pier, which is on 
the way to the Promenade, was swarming with toughs in gang regalia, and the 
Promenade itself featured the darkly comic spectacle of a woman at a cafe table 
outside a ritzy trattoria rattling her doggie bag at a beggar crossing the 
street and yelling, "Oh, yoo-hoo! Mister Homeless Man! Are you hungry? Would 
you like my food?" 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, this is not the world's greatest spot either for a romantic 
moonlight stroll or a relaxing day at the beach. We began to realize that it 
was probably best not to leave the hotel. And this would have been fine, if it 
weren't for those other problems -- the ones Shutters can, and should, do 
something about. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived about 3:25 p.m., well past the 3 p.m. check-in time. But we were 
told by the desk clerk that our double occupancy room with the partial ocean 
view ($285 per night, plus $34.20 room tax, plus $15 to park) wasn't ready yet. 
Our promised five-minute delay turned into a 40-minute wait in the lobby while 
the housekeeping staff belatedly tidied up. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh floor room was a delight, with a fluffy king-sized bed and lots of 
lovely little touches -- a book of bedtime stories on the night stand; a big 
shuttered window that opened from the bathtub onto the main room; old-fashioned 
slipcovered easy chairs. But the partial ocean view turned out to be a window 
on the old Synanon building across the street, with only a glimpse of beach and 
a sliver of ocean beyond the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then the bellboy arrived with our luggage and my husband's white shirt, which 
he had apparently dropped in the dirt. When my husband pointed out the smudge, 
he was profusely apologetic and offered to have the shirt laundered that 
afternoon for free, and to return it by dinner time. But dinner (at Wolfgang 
Puck's recently opened cafeteria-style pizzeria on a balcony at the Third 
Street Promenade) came and went without the shirt; in fact, we didn't hear word 
one from the hotel staff until the next morning, when they woke us from a sound 
sleep at 7 a.m. to ask whether we had wanted that shirt washed, or just 
pressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cranky, we called the concierge, and again received abject apologies, plus an 
offer of a free breakfast in the hotel cafe, Pedals -- a true peace offering 
because the food was just excellent. Shutters serves one of the best beachfront 
breakfasts around, and the smoked salmon with peppered cream cheese and bagels 
was particularly delicious. But then, when it was time to sign the bill, we 
asked the maitre d' whether the front desk had told him this meal was to have 
been free; he knew nothing about it, and we had to explain the situation, which 
he accommodated graciously once his confusion had passed. 
</P>
<P>
 We spent the day relaxing by the hotel pool -- a lovely affair with plenty of 
whitewashed chaises and vine-covered trellises and umbrellas for shade. When it 
got windy late in the day, we worked out at the well-appointed hotel health 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after they finally returned the missing shirt, we headed down for dinner 
at One Pico, the hotel restaurant. Once again, the food was some of the best 
we've had in Los Angeles. It was capably served in an airy beachfront room with 
a massive fireplace, high, beamed ceilings and panoramic views of the beach.  
</P>
<P>
 But then, at checkout time, the goblins struck again when the bellboy 
accidentally put one of our bags on someone else's baggage cart. We were all 
the way home when we realized that we were missing some of our luggage; we had 
to drive back across town to retrieve it Monday morning.  
</P>
<P>
 "Geez," laughed my husband's teen-age nephew afterward, as we related our tale 
to relatives. "It sounds like a dream hotel, if it weren't for all the 
glitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Which pretty much summed it up. Budget for Two 
</P>
<P>

CRUISE VIEWS: A NEW STAR ON THE HIGH SEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gleaming Star Odyssey from Royal Cruise Line is the newest reincarnation 
of the classic Royal Viking Star, a favorite ship for many frequent cruisers 
since 1972 when it was built for Royal Viking Line. The 750-passenger ship 
replaces the vintage 450-passenger Golden Odyssey in the RCL fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 We thought we knew the Royal Viking Star well, but when we went aboard the 
Star Odyssey in the Port of Los Angeles to spend an afternoon and evening, it 
was almost as if we were boarding a whole new ship. 
</P>
<P>
 The carpeting and upholstery has a muted palate of beiges and pastels instead 
of the bright greens, blues and corals previously used. The expansive dining 
room, always big enough to accommodate all the passengers at a single seating, 
still has its view windows along two walls, but seemed even more spacious with 
pale furniture and sunny Italian frescoes on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Panorama Lounge, pale blue carpeting and chairs replace the large brown 
leather loungers. The show lounge, never one of the strong points of the old 
Royal Viking ships, has been improved with a new sloping floor plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering spot for pre-dinner cocktails is the new Dionysi's Bar adjacent 
to the show lounge with rose tapestry sofas and tub chairs, oval marble tables 
and a long bar with leather swivel stools. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Royal's particular appeals is the wide range of lunch and snack service 
venues aboard, from a full menu in the dining room to a soup and salad bar 
convenient to the card rooms for bridge players. Near the pool buffet is 
Yianni's Hearth, serving hot cinnamon buns in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 An outdoor splash pool with two whirlpool spas has been added to the Penthouse 
deck, while the Horizon deck has an attractive spa with big windows looking out 
to the sea and an array of exercise equipment, including stair climbers, 
stationary bicycles, rowing machines, a treadmill and weights. 
</P>
<P>
 A casino, several large duty-free shops, library and reading room, card rooms, 
a movie theater and beauty salon are also on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers may appreciate such extras as the Heart's Content menus, special 
meals featured on all menus that follow the American Heart Assn. guidelines for 
a low-fat and low-cholesterol diet; a motivational lecture series called New 
Beginnings, tailored especially for Royal's mostly senior audience, and a folk 
music and dance performance given by the Greek crew once during each cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabins have been refurbished and range from penthouse suites with private 
verandas to standard but comfortable inside (windowless) quarters with twin 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Brochure prices for the 10-day Alaska cruise range from $249 per person per 
day, double occupancy, for a standard inside, to $819 per person per day, 
double occupancy, for the top penthouse apartment with separate bedroom and 
sitting room, bath with tub and shower, private veranda, refrigerator and 
butler service. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best buys aboard are the 240-square-foot category H cabins on 
Marina deck with picture window, sitting area, bath with tub and shower and 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Panama Canal transit from San Francisco on Sept. 3 ending in Nassau, 
the Star Odyssey will offer two eight-day Colonial America sailings (Sept. 17 
and Oct. 24) calling in Charleston, Savannah, Williamsburg and Baltimore, the 
latter for Washington, D.C., tours. Prices range from $1,719 to $4,799 per 
person, double occupancy, including air fare from Los Angeles.

DESTINATION: FRANCE; IMPRESSIONS OF VAN GOGH; A PILGRIMAGE TO THE PLACE WHERE 
THE ARTIST DIED AND A LOOK INTO THE CREATIVE SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By P.B. , Brooker is an artist with the Miami Herald. His paintings have been 
displayed in galleries in Paris, New York and Miami.

<P>
 I am obsessed with the life of Vincent van Gogh. This started when I was 11 
years old and saw the movie version of Van Gogh's life, "Lust for Life," 
starring Kirk Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 My obsession has taken me around the world -- to New York, Los Angeles, 
London, Geneva, Paris, Edinburgh -- looking at private and public collections 
that include his work. But most often, I have traveled to Auvers, a small 
village north of Paris where Van Gogh spent the last few months of his life. 
Last autumn I made the most important pilgrimage yet: a visit to the small room 
where he lived, which opened to the public last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was 37. Van Gogh was 37 when he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Auvers is about 32 miles north of Paris. But despite being so near a big city, 
one feels completely in the countryside in the Oise valley. It is a simple 
village of a few thousand people, typical of countless others in France. The 
center is dominated by a few shops and cafes, with narrow streets lined with 
neat houses whose window boxes are filled with geraniums. Notre Dame, the Roman 
Catholic church made famous by a Van Gogh painting, stands near the edge of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors come to Auvers for one reason only, and that is Van Gogh. Nearly all 
of the places he painted during his short stay still exist, and familiar 
paintings come frequently to mind as one wanders about town. Thanks to the 
largess of designer Yves St. Laurent, the town is dotted with signs that point 
out the real scenes and juxtapose them with the paintings. Otherwise, there are 
few other obvious reminders that Van Gogh stayed here. T-shirt shops are, 
thankfully, nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 I always make my way to the church first. Van Gogh painted this church, 
creating a masterpiece that matched the words he wrote about it: "The building 
appears to be violet-hued against the sky of a simple deep blue color, pure 
cobalt; the stained glass windows appear as ultramarine blotches; the roof is 
sand with the pink glow of sunshine on it." 
</P>
<P>
 I never go inside the church anymore; for me there is but one view of it, and 
that is the view that Van Gogh painted. 
</P>
<P>
 A rusty sign across from the church points up the hill toward Van Gogh's tomb; 
the small winding road leading to the cemetery. On my way up, I always look 
back to see the village and the Oise River valley. The view has hardly changed 
over the decades, and it takes little imagination to see what this place looked 
like in Van Gogh's day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This time, as I rounded the bend heading for the cemetery, I noticed on this 
familiar horizon a new horror. Instead of the vicious, darting crows I had come 
to expect, I saw something far more awful: tourists. I must admit that I, too, 
was there as a tourist. Still, for me the area is sacred, and I detested 
sharing it with a horde descended from a pair of belching buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, tourists were everywhere, scattered all over the fields like bad brush 
strokes dressed in fluorescent track suits, hats and sneakers. The whole scene 
looked like a very bad Impressionist painting executed in neon colors by 
someone far more lunatic than Van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
 With the worldwide publicity about the opening of his room, this was bound to 
happen; in fact, more than half a million have visited since the opening last 
September of l'Auberge Ravoux, where the room is located. I will just have to 
accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Vincent, what have you done . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The pack of tourists finally moved from the cemetery to investigate other 
wonders, leaving me to place my flowers on Van Gogh's grave. (I always leave 
something -- irises or a paintbrush.) 
</P>
<P>
 The grave is simple, situated in a typical French cemetery with a high wall 
surrounding it. Next to it is that of his brother, Theo, who died just six 
months after Vincent -- they say, poetically, of a broken heart. Theo's wife 
planted upon the graves a sprig of ivy from the garden of his doctor, Paul 
Gachet, and today the two simple headstones are still swathed in dark green 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 From the graveyard, one can easily wander across the fields to where he 
painted one of his last and most famous paintings, "Crows in the Wheat Field." 
It was there that I met up with the gang of tourists. Cameras flashed in every 
direction. A gentle rain had begun to fall again; the tourists let out a cry of 
dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go, go," I said under my breath. I longed to have this place to myself. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly all was quiet. The rain had given way to a light drizzle and then 
finally a fine mist, which covered the fields like a spectacular dry ice show. 
I touched the soil with my hand and started to walk in the footsteps that Van 
Gogh must have taken many times before as I made my way down the slope and back 
into town. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gogh arrived here in May, 1890, by train. He walked up the gentle slope, 
past the home owned by the artist Daubigny, along the winding Rue des Vessenots 
and finally to Gachet's house. 
</P>
<P>
 It was because of Gachet that Van Gogh came to Auvers. Vincent's brother, 
Theo, knew of the doctor's reputation as one who had helped other artists -- 
including Cezanne -- cope with their sometimes frail states of mind. And Theo, 
who lived in Paris, could rest a little easier knowing he could quickly reach 
Vincent, should he fall ill again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Auvers, Van Gogh found lodging in a small inn owned by Arthur Gustave 
Ravoux and his wife, who charged him about 70 cents a day for full board. The 
room was small and modest, 8 feet by 8 feet, and furnished with only a single 
metal-frame bed, a tiny skylight that let the northern sun shine through, a 
small table and a washbowl. This suited Van Gogh, who would fill the room over 
the next few weeks with many wet canvasses -- one for each day that he stayed. 
What also attracted Van Gogh to the inn was the cozy atmosphere of the cafe 
downstairs, with its billiards room not unlike one he had painted a few years 
before in the south of France. 
</P>
<P>
 A century later, in 1983, when a Belgian businessman named Dominique Janssens 
happened through town, the inn was in total disrepair. Until then, Janssens had 
had no particular interest in the artist. But in Auvers he was involved in an 
auto accident that, according to the police report, occurred outside "the Van 
Gogh house." His interest was piqued, and soon he became enthralled. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Janssens a decade to raise more than $6 million to restore the 
two-story stucco building to its former quiet glory. Last fall, he reopened it 
as l'Auberge Ravoux; today, as then, it houses a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Details have been faithfully reproduced. An old mural was uncovered and 
restored. The chairs, gas lamps and lace curtains are of that period. The 
restaurant offers the sort of hearty country fare -- stews, steaks and 
vegetables -- that was served in Van Gogh's day. 
</P>
<P>
 My friends and I were to have lunch at the inn, then visit Van Gogh's room. We 
entered through the side door. The murmur of voices and aromas of wonderful 
food wafted through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 I was stricken by anxiety. But I proceeded past the small room where Van Gogh 
had painted when the weather was too bad to go outside; past the small 
staircase up to his room and then finally into the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody -- my friends, and the very French patrons with their well-behaved 
children and dogs -- seemed so relaxed. Was it just me? I wanted to stand on my 
chair and scream, "What's wrong with you all? How can you just sit there? He 
died up there. Yes, up there in that tiny room. Doesn't that mean anything to 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I took another large gulp of wine and stared at the ceiling, soaked 
in anticipation for my visit to the room, the visit I had imagined so many 
times. I had painted many scenes based on the end of his life, but I did not 
really know what this room, his last home, looked like. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As I finished my glass of wine, I glanced over at the front entrance of the 
inn and pictured Van Gogh's final return from a day in the fields. On July 29, 
1890, just after lunch, Van Gogh left the inn and walked 1 1/2 kilometers to 
the Chateau d'Auvers, the local manor house. He leaned his easel against a 
haystack, walked down a small dirt track that ran down beside the chateau's 
wall, pulled out a revolver, placed it to his chest and pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether he intended to kill himself or whether this was just 
another of his self-mutilation tantrums. In any event, he lay there for some 
time before rising and making his way back to the inn. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Ravoux stood outside his inn and saw Van Gogh in the distance. Van Gogh 
seemed to be hunched over. He came closer, then he entered the inn and 
staggered up the narrow staircase for the final time. 
</P>
<P>
 Theo arrived the next day from Paris, finding Van Gogh much better than he had 
expected. The two brothers talked in their native Dutch; Van Gogh puffed on a 
pipe. But as the daylight turned to dark, so did Van Gogh's health. Theo knew 
the end was near and climbed onto the small steel bed, cradling his brother's 
head in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could pass away like this," Van Gogh said. Half an hour later he was 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 At last, my own lesser wish was granted -- to see Van Gogh's room. 
</P>
<P>
 I told Janssens, the director, of my fascination with Van Gogh and how I was 
working on a series of paintings based on Van Gogh's stay at Auvers. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, five people at a time are allowed in, and only for a few minutes but 
Janssens did something quite wonderful for me. He closed the room from the 
public for a short while so I could look around in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 As I walked up the stairs, my eyes stung with tears. I had lived this route a 
million times in my mind; finally it was real. I couldn't bring myself to turn 
the small black doorknob; Janssens did it for me. Then he left me alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I stood there in the tiny room, unable to breathe at first. The last gentle 
beam of light poked its way through the window and then disappeared for the 
rest of the day. The room darkened. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried to absorb everything. I could see the nail holes where Van Gogh had 
hung his paintings to dry. There were marks on the wall and floor where his bed 
had once been, and a small cubbyhole where Van Gogh must have stashed his few 
possessions. The room was completely empty, but I could only see it as it must 
have been on that disastrous day. 
</P>
<P>
 With the rain gently starting to tap on the skylight, I took a deep breath and 
left almost running from the scene. I spent the night drawing sketch after 
sketch of Van Gogh in his room. I was frantic and heartbroken. Up to now, 
visiting the little village had been a comfortable experience. Now it was 
unbearably sad. This was a man who painted the sun like nobody has ever painted 
it before, and to end up in this dark little room seemed terribly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy was suddenly real to me, and what was worse was that I knew it 
could happen to me, to anyone. We are all vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 The town of Auvers, too, is in danger. I hope it and the inn can remain quiet 
and untrampled. I worry that Van Gogh's room will somehow collapse under the 
stare of too many visitors. After all, it was never intended as a tourist 
attraction, just a small room where a virtually unknown Dutch painter was to 
stay for a short time. GUIDEBOOK: Van Gogh in Auvers

TAKING THE KIDS: COLLECTING POSTCARDS FROM THE HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Garcias never figured they would care that much about a pile of postcards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started because we were always forgetting the camera," explained Marie 
Garcia, the mother of three who lives in White Bear Lake, Minn. "We'd buy a 
postcard wherever we went and write a little bit on the back about our day." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the Garcia kids got an album for their cards. When they filled that, they 
got another. Now they like looking at their postcards so much they keep the 
albums in the car, adding to the books wherever they go. 
</P>
<P>
 Their collection is still very small -- minuscule compared to that of a 
serious postcard collector such as Howard Woody, who teaches art at the 
University of South Carolina in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been at it for 40 years," he said, resulting in a collection of 20,000 
to 30,000 cards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Woody and his friends started as teen-agers. They'd try to get one from every 
state, then every country, he said, sending them to each other wherever they 
went. The other kids quit eventually. But Woody said his collection has 
"followed me closet to closet ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's affordable and you can tailor it to your own life," Woody said, 
referring to collecting cards about favorite subjects or places. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles pediatrician Jeff Fireman agrees. He has vacation cards dating 
back 30 years or more to when he was a child growing up in suburban Chicago. 
"It's fun to look at them," he said. "You take them out and get the feel of the 
place again." 
</P>
<P>
 He is not alone in his affection for the pastime. Sending and collecting 
vacation postcards has become such an American tradition that the Smithsonian 
Institution's year-old National Postal Museum in Washington is planning an 
exhibit for next year tentatively called "Are We There Yet?" (For museum 
information, call 202-633-9360.) 
</P>
<P>
 A current display at the National Postal Museum chronicles postcard history 
and our continuing love affair with them. The card craze started in Europe in 
the waning days of the 19th Century, said Nancy Pope, the museum's postal 
history curator. 
</P>
<P>
 It soon crossed the Atlantic and by the first decade of the 20th Century, Pope 
said, families were competing to see who had the most postcards. In addition, 
they would hold postcard exchanges and even have family portraits printed on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In those early years when newspapers didn't publish many photographs, 
postcards could also have significant news and historic value, especially after 
a disaster. "There were 100 postcard views of the Great San Francisco 
Earthquake," Pope said. "That was how people would see what it looked like." 
</P>
<P>
 As Americans began to travel more widely, postcards became the preferred way 
to show friends and family where they had been. "It became that cliched, 'Wish 
You Were Here' message," Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, many generations have discovered how much fun sending, receiving 
and collecting them can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an icon of the past and also the present. Postcard collecting is really 
popular now," said Faith Ruffins, a historian at the Smithsonian's National 
Museum of American History and an expert on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live so far from those who have meaning in our lives. Postcards are a way 
of giving evidence to people of what our lives have been about," said Bernard 
Beck, a Northwestern University sociology professor and expert on popular 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Collecting anything and everything is popular now, Beck said, as if "everybody 
needs proof they've had a life." Postcards offer tangible evidence that we've 
been somewhere and done something. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for kids. Too often, they get bored traveling because parents expect them 
to appreciate places from an adult perspective. Sending and collecting 
postcards might be a good way to sustain their interest in someplace new. "At 
least it might keep them out of mischief," Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffins, herself the mother of two young children, agrees that the century-old 
hobby is still a good bet for kids. "Postcards are visual," she said. "They're 
portable and they're cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffins recommends buying the kids multiple copies of the same card. They can 
send one to a friend, keep one and have one to use later for an art project or 
school report. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Garcia was among several who wrote to me recently offering 
postcard-collecting strategies when I asked readers for ideas to help today's 
families create some lasting memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always send a picture postcard back home with a short vacation memory 
written on it," wrote Joan Kohn from Cleveland, Ohio. "Aaron is 3 1/2 and likes 
to get mail," she explained. Besides, it's such an easy thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Helpful too. After Shell Hoskinson's grandmother and friends visited, he gave 
them each a postcard detailing highlights of their stay. That way, he 
explained, they could better recount their adventures when they got home.  
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime they couldn't remember what they did, they pulled out the postcard 
from their purse and continued on with the story," wrote Hoskinson of 
Wilsonville, Ore. "Each of my grandmother's friends called to thank me." 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe we should all stop shooting so much video on vacation and write a few 
more postcards. Jeff Fireman, for one, figures he'll be enjoying his collection 
long after those vacation videos have been misplaced. 
</P>

HIKING: LAKE TAHOE BASIN; PAY ATTENTION TO THE LITTLE LAKES, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lake Tahoe isn't the only lake in the Lake Tahoe Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 A hundred lakes, both named and unnamed, are scattered like jewels in a slice 
of Sierra called Desolation Wilderness, just west of the great lake. Aloha, 
Avalanche, Boomerang, Hemlock and Half Moon are among the colorfully named 
lakes situated about 8,000 feet in elevation and bordered with impressive and 
photogenic granite backdrops. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-mile-long, eight-mile-wide Desolation Wilderness is too popular with 
visitors to be considered desolate, and too close to Tahoe to be considered a 
true wilderness, but it does offer a superb play land for anglers, swimmers and 
hikers. 
</P>
<P>
 One excellent Tahoe trail leads up dramatic, glacially sculpted Eagle Lake 
Canyon to a backcountry basin containing the Velma lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Families with small children will enjoy the one-mile climb through the forest 
to Eagle Lake. More experienced hikers will head for Lower, Middle and Upper 
Velma lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From the junction of California 50 and 89 in South 
Lake Tahoe, drive nine miles north on California 89 to the signed turnoff on 
the left for Eagle Falls Picnic Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Park in the lot if there's room, otherwise park with caution alongside the 
highway. (If you are coming from Tahoe City, follow California 89 south about 
18 1/2 miles to the picnic area.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Forest Service reports that vehicle break-ins have occurred in this lot. 
Lock your car and secure your valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 At the trail head, fill out a wilderness permit. Keep one copy and drop the 
other in the box. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: From the signed trail head, the path ascends the canyon, soon 
crossing Eagle Creek on a pedestrian bridge. The trail ascends a rock-strewn 
rise, enters the Desolation Wilderness, then reaches a second rise offering 
terrific views of Emerald Bay, Lake Tahoe and the Carson Range. 
</P>
<P>
 Just short of a mile from the trail head is a junction. The right fork leads 
200 yards to granite cliff-surrounded Eagle Lake, a perfect picnic spot. 
</P>
<P>
 To continue to the Velma lakes, you will join the trail's left fork and begin 
a steep climb. 
</P>
<P>
 Looming over you is the sheer granite wall of Maggies Peak. The path winds 
through lodgepole pines and scattered stands of Sierra juniper. Almost three 
miles from the trail head, your trail will be joined by another coming up from 
the left -- Bay View Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Your route levels a bit, you pass the left-branching Dicks Lake Trail and 
continue on with Velma Lakes Trail. After passing an unnamed lake on your left 
and crossing its outlet stream, you will arrive at a trail junction. (The 
left-forking trail climbs south one-third mile to Upper Velma Lake.) 
</P>
<P>
 Stay right and walk another quarter-mile to a junction with the famed Pacific 
Crest Trail. Stay right again and continue a short quarter mile to Middle Velma 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunbathe on the shore, swim out to a little rock island, try to catch a 
rainbow trout -- the sprawling lake is a very mellow place to unwind. Eagle 
Lake, Emerald Bay, Velma Lakes Trails 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Velma Lakes area, near Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: To Eagle Lake is 2 miles round trip with 400-foot elevation gain; to 
Middle Velma Lake is 9 miles round trip with 1,600-foot gain. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Glacially carved canyons, pine forests. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Lots of lakes for swimming and fishing reached by one of Tahoe's 
best trails. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Moderate to strenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 PRECAUTIONS: Wilderness permit required. 
</P>

BACKPACK & BUDGET; AH, TO BE CAREFREE, UNDER 21 AND ABLE TO RENT A CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Although minimum age restrictions on car rentals vary in European countries, 
it's rare for anyone under age 21 to be allowed to rent a car. Here's the 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemwel Group based in Harrison, N.Y., operates the Peugeot New Car Student 
Plan. You don't actually have to be a student to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemwel can arrange the rental of a Peugeot for anyone 18 years and older who 
has a valid driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemwel has arranged with Peugeot for participants to receive a new car 
directly from the factory. The cars can be picked up in France, or for an extra 
charge in Belgium, Germany, Holland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and the 
United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Rental agreements are for a minimum of two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Car rentals can be economical when a small group shares the expenses. It is 
important, however, that you consider luggage capacity and consumption of gas 
when you make your choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuel in Europe can be double the price it is in the United States or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Car rental advantages include having the flexibility to explore back roads not 
accessible to train and bus travelers, and not having to lug baggage to your 
hostel. 
</P>
<P>
 A major drawback is that you insulate yourself from exposure to local 
residents by not sharing their much-used forms of public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates for the Peugeot New Car Student Plan include free unlimited mileage, 
full non-deductible collision insurance, 24-hour roadside assistance and a 
complete new-car warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 An all-inclusive two-week rate for a Peugeot 106 four-door hatchback, for 
example, begins at $429 (or $107 per person, four sharing), tax and insurance 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 Compact and larger-sized cars are also available. 
</P>
<P>
 For further information, contact a travel agent or the Kemwel Group at (800) 
678-0678.

</P>
<P>
 Travelers to England and Scotland who want to limit transportation costs but 
avoid trekking with their backpacks between train and bus stations and hostels 
can take an economical door-to-door bus service called the Slow Coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Slow Coach covers a circular, scenic route from London to Windsor, Bath, 
Stratford-upon-Avon, the Lake District, Edinburgh, York and Cambridge before 
returning to London. In summer, it will stop between Edinburgh and York at the 
2nd-Century remains of Hadrian's Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 You can start and stop where you want and take up to two months to complete 
the whole journey. Tickets can also be purchased for segments of the route. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus will deliver and pick up passengers from the doors of the youth 
hostels en route.  
</P>
<P>
 The driver carries a list of economical alternative bed and breakfasts, 
YMCA/YWCAs and campsites in case the youth hostel is full. 
</P>
<P>
 In summer, a Slow Coach visits each hostel almost every day. During the 
winter, the service drops to about twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to cover the complete the 1,000-mile circuit is about $106. Tickets 
can be purchased at youth hostels en route. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, you can buy them at YHA Travel Centre, 14 Southampton St., London 
WC2, or get information by calling (0249) 891959. (From North America 
011-44-249-891959.)

THE MISSING INGREDIENT: CUSTOMERS; BAKERY AND OTHER BUSINESSES NEAR FLORENCE 
AND NORMANDIE ARE STRUGGLING SINCE THE RIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From the porch of her bakery on Florence Avenue, Christine Van Koll watches 
anxiouslyas potential customers zoom by in their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major street and people fly by like crazy," said the owner of Chris 
Cakes and Catering, a few blocks from Normandie Avenue. "After the civil 
unrest, every time we mention Florence, no one wants to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Florence and Normandie, the intersection that became known worldwide as the 
flash point of the 1992 riots, has also become a symbol of suffering small 
businesses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The change is evident in the number of storefronts no longer open around the 
area. Van Koll counted on her fingers as she listed the surrounding businesses 
torched in 1992: Finest Neighborhood Market, George's Louisiana Chicken, 
Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those that managed to survive the riots, the future looks grim. Van 
Koll and other business owners in the area say they are on the verge of 
economic ruin, despite well-publicized campaigns calling for revitalization of 
the area. Excessive borrowing and picking up odd jobs to make ends meet have 
become the norm for some of the small merchants who have long since seen their 
businesses at their prime.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, those of us that made it through (the riots) are not going to 
survive," Van Koll said. Merchants "have managed to borrow, beg or steal to 
make money and survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners and financial analysts in the area say there appears to be 
little relief in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen no concentrated efforts to redevelop the Florence-Normandie 
area," said Roberto Barragan, executive director of the Community Financial 
Resource Center, which started offering loans in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The Resource Center, which has an office south of the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum, provides loan assistance and money management at no cost for 
residents and businesses in South-Central. Barragan said the only financial 
assistance area merchants have received has been through the federal Small 
Business Administration, whose loans the center helps disburse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Those that did survive and had a healthy business received SBA loans in '92," 
Barragan said. "Some businesses are still trying to build after the riots and 
they come to us. But since SBA requires them to use property as collateral, 
it's often difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Barragan cited reduced property values since the riots, destroyed property, 
existing debt and an "area that's not consumer friendly" as factors that have 
contributed to the area's plight. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said another reason for the snail-paced recovery in the area is 
a concerted effort by the community to rebuild a better economic district than 
the liquor-store-dominated area it was. There are 19 liquor stores between 
Manchester and Slauson avenues along Western and Normandie avenues. The closest 
supermarket in that sector is a Boys' Market at Manchester and Western. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now the community is in the process of determining what 
Florence-Normandie is going to look like," said Margaret Diop, planning deputy 
for Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents the Florence-Normandie area. 
"Through redevelopment we want to create a source of revenue in the area to 
bring about community-based economic development." 
</P>
<P>
 Diop said the Western Corridor redevelopment project will probably be adopted 
sometime next year. The commercial corridor is bounded roughly by Vernon Avenue 
to the north, Florence and 80th Street to the south, Van Ness Avenue to the 
east and Vermont Avenue to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This project is one of four recovery study areas in Ridley-Thomas' 8th 
District that focuses on revitalizing the main commercial corridors damaged 
during the riots, Diop said. 
</P>
<P>
 But business owners in the Florence-Normandie area fear that the dwindling 
customer base spurred by the slow economy and negative perceptions of the area 
means they won't survive long enough to see any plans for economic 
revitalization come to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the riots, people are afraid to come to the neighborhood . . . or 
people don't have money," said Isabel Boyce, owner of Boyce and Howard Swap 
Shop, which she has operated for 18 years down the street from Chris Cakes. 
"There's been a great change. People don't come by like they used to. " 
</P>
<P>
 Van Koll said neighboring businesses that remained standing after the riots 
have consistently asked her if she knows where they can secure loans. Others, 
like Boyce, asked if they could work for her. But since 1992, Van Koll said she 
has had to reduce her staff from five full-time employees to two part-timers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were thinking it was going to get better in 1993, but everyone is 
complaining that this year is the worst of all," Van Koll said. "Business for 
me has dropped 50% to 60% since 1992." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to survive, Van Koll has started offering breakfasts and lunches 
on delivery to office workers outside the area.  
</P>
<P>
 A native of South-Central, Van Koll started her bakery with her husband, 
Frank, 16 years ago from her house kitchen. Then she sold baked goods from a 
small space on Van Ness and Florence until she moved to her current location at 
the corner of 7th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have to think about relocating or sit here and die," she said. "I may 
have to go into something completely outside of bakery."

MOCK ELECTIONS IN L.A. SEND A MESSAGE TO MEXICO; POLITICS: EMIGRES 
PARTICIPATING IN BALLOTING HOPE THEIR VOTES WILL FORCE THE COUNTRY'S LEADERSHIP 
TO TAKE NOTICE OF MEXICANS LIVING IN THE SOUTHLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since Mexicans living abroad are effectively cut off from voting in their 
country's monumental elections today, they have had to find other ways to 
participate in the heated debates surrounding the election of their nation's 
next leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a barrage of word-of-mouth proxy campaigns and mock elections, 
Southern California-based representatives from Mexico's leading political 
parties last week attempted to shore up support and send a powerful message 
across the border: Mexicans living in Los Angeles are increasing in power and 
numbers, and the next time their country chooses a president, the candidates 
may have to trek north in search of votes as well as money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government doesn't want us to vote because the government doesn't want to 
lose," Francisco Adame said as he cast his vote last week at a ballot box on 
Pacific Boulevard in Huntington Park. Adame was one of 4,000 Mexicans who voted 
in mock elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Adame, 57, who was born in the state of Zacatecas, said he was dismayed by the 
lack of attention the current administration pays to the millions of Mexicans 
living in the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans living outside their country are technically allowed to vote, but 
Mexican electoral law makes it difficult for most emigres to exercise that 
right. Mexico has no system for voting by absentee ballot, as Americans do. 
Those living abroad must be registered at a permanent address within the 
country, and must return to Mexico to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the mock vote say a goal of their protest is to institute 
absentee-balloting for the next elections in 2000. Marisela Espinosa, 35, an 
organizer of the mock election, said a trip across the border to vote is costly 
and difficult for the many Mexicans who are struggling to make ends meet in the 
United States. And for those lacking documents, the added risk of re-crossing 
the border makes the trip out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures compiled by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, the number of potentially eligible Mexican voters residing in the 
United States is more than 2.5 million. As many as 45.7 million Mexican voters 
are eligible to head to the polls today to elect a new president and National 
Congress, under the watchful eyes of about 35,000 independent Mexican poll 
watchers and, for the first time, several hundred foreign "visitors." The 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has ruled Mexico for 65 years and was 
widely accused of vote fraud in elections six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The mock balloting last week at more than 20 locations in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties was organized by the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), one 
of Mexico's leading opposition parties, and the State Human Rights Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 At a gathering Monday in front of the Mexican Consulate, amid the jingle of 
ice cream bells and the blare of norteno music, representatives from the PRD 
advertised the results to the long lines of people waiting to enter the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 4,000 votes cast in Southern California, the center-left PRD received 
65%, the center-right National Action Party (PAN) received 20% and the ruling 
PRI received 11%. Other parties received 4% of the votes cast.  
</P>
<P>
 These results are in contrast to most of the recent polls in Mexico, which 
show the ruling PRI enjoying a comfortable lead. Most polls showed Ernesto 
Zedillo, the PRI candidate, with more than 40% support, to 20% for the PAN's 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos and 10% going to the PRD's Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. 
About 25% of those polled were still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 "We send billions of dollars back to our families in Mexico every year," said 
Melesio Mejia, a PRD member and one of the organizers of the mock vote. "For 
that reason alone, we should be allowed to vote. We're the backbone of our 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 In reaction to criticism during the last presidential election, the Mexican 
government has set up polling places called casillas especiales -- literally, 
"special booths" -- in large cities along the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Escobar, a spokesman for the Mexican Consulate, said 18 such polling 
places have been placed in Baja California. Going into the election, Escobar 
said it was unknown how many would cross the border to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a rise in interest among Mexicans all over the world 
concerning these elections," said Escobar, who is prohibited from expressing 
sympathies to any party. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park resident Antonio Moreno, however, expresses his sympathies 
loudly to all who will listen. He is head of a pro-PRI committee that receives 
that party's candidates when they visit Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "Those elections held by the PRD last week don't count, and even if they did 
it wouldn't matter -- the PRI has more militantes than any other party in Los 
Angeles," said Moreno.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, 48, said he planned to drive to Tijuana to vote for Zedillo, his 
party's candidate. And if Zedillo doesn't win? "The people will decide who wins 
on Sunday and we will respect that decision."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: RANCHO CIENEGA; RED CROSS SEEKING MARROW DONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles chapter of the American Red Cross is seeking African American 
bone marrow donors and will be testing potential candidates for five days at 
the African Marketplace and Cultural Faire at Rancho Cienega Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials say there is a critical need for marrow from African 
Americans, who make up only about 5% of the roughly 1 million registered 
donors. A patient's chances of finding a matching donor are best when both 
share the same ethnic background.  
</P>
<P>
 Marrow transplants help combat leukemia and other fatal blood diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors will be tested at the fair, at 5001 Rodeo Road, on Saturday and Aug. 28 
and Sept. 3, 4 and 5.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; FINDING SUCCESS IN THEIR SALAD DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY

<TEXT>
<P>
 As temperatures were hitting record highs in the city last weekend, a group of 
student entrepreneurs were busy turning up the heat to promote their salad 
dressing at the latest market chain to sell their product: Mrs. Gooch's health 
food stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten Crenshaw High students wearing Food From the 'Hood aprons and bright 
smiles offered up tastes of their creamy Italian dressing on pita bread squares 
to shoppers in Beverly Hills, West Los Angeles, Redondo Beach, Sherman Oaks, 
Thousand Oaks, Glendale and Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from sales of the salad dressing, "Straight Out the Garden," benefit 
a scholarship fund for the nearly 30 students who co-own Food from the 'Hood, a 
produce business they launched on campus nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict on the dressing from health-conscious Westside and Valley 
customers: "They liked the taste a lot, but everybody asked if we had a low-fat 
or no-fat version," said 17-year-old Natasha Proby, who worked at the Beverly 
Hills store, selling 24 bottles of dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we're going to talk about at our next meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 The venture, which started as a project to rehabilitate a weedy patch of land 
near Crenshaw's football field, has mushroomed into a salad-dressing business 
with nationwide distribution in nearly 100 supermarkets and stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they won't reveal sales figures because of concerns about competition 
from other dressings, students say they are on target with fiscal goals this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 And in January, Food From the 'Hood established an office in a converted 
biology lab on Crenshaw's campus to keep up with all the business.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're just growing by leaps and bounds," said biology teacher Tammy Bird, who 
helped students launch the business and gave up coaching soccer to devote more 
time to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the vision. . . . We just needed someone to believe in us enough to 
give us the money to really get going." 
</P>
<P>
 After getting a combined $100,000 in cash and in-kind donations from the city 
and RLA last December, Food From the 'Hood set up its salad dressing line. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of food manufacturer Sweet Adelaide and salad-dressing 
entrepreneur Norris Bernstein and other professionals, the group was able to 
make, bottle and get its salad dressing onto grocery shelves via food brokers 
and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 After students settled on a recipe, the Hawthorne-based Sweet Adelaide made 
and packaged the dressing and local food brokers got busy selling "Straight Out 
the Garden" to supermarkets and other stores.  
</P>
<P>
 The business was flying so high that even the Jan. 17 earthquake proved 
something of a blessing: The week that Crenshaw High shut down gave students 
time to put their office together without distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of public relations executive Melinda McMullen, who now works 
full time with the business, students cleaned out a room used to house animals 
for a traveling zoo project and set up $8,000 worth of office equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The office features a row of computer terminals, a phone, printer and fax 
machine, and a long marble-topped table where students gather for board 
meetings and ad presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's moving real fast, faster than I thought it would," 16-year-old Ketric 
Jenkins said of the business, which still holds to its original tenet of 
regularly donating at least 25% of its garden-grown produce to charities such 
as Helpers for the Homeless and Hungry, a Crenshaw-based food bank. 
</P>
<P>
 All profits from dressing sales go to a college scholarship fund, and student 
owners receive shares of the pool based on academic performance, college 
preparation work and the amount of work they put into the business. They do not 
receive salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jenkins, a senior this year, the scholarship money will help keep him on 
the track to college. "I'm still tired from working all those stores last 
weekend, but it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Proby, reviewing a set of mock-up ad cards for Food From the 'Hood, said it's 
been gratifying for a cooperative run by young people in the inner city to get 
so much attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But she hopes people won't lose sight of an even more significant fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to focus on our dressing -- it's good," she said. "We don't 
want them to just say, 'Oh, look at these poor kids, let's help them out.' We 
want to be judged by our product." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; HOMELESS SHELTER IS FACING CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year of closure threats, the doors of a homeless shelter at 250 W. 
120th St. are scheduled to be shut at the end of the month, putting more than 
100 residents back on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Tuesday night, more than 20 people, including representatives of 
several elected officials, brainstormed about how to find at least temporary 
residences for the 115 people staying at the Family Services Center. The 
director of the organization has sent out a plea for community leaders and 
elected officials to help keep a roof over the heads of the families. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Smith, founder and director of the 1 1/2-year-old facility, said the 
center has been struggling for the past several months to pay overdue bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith started the Family Services Center in January, 1993, to assist homeless 
families -- couples and single parents with children -- in southern Los 
Angeles. The shelter operates from a former hospital that had been abandoned 
for about three years before Smith's organization occupied and renovated parts 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've wanted to do this for a long time," Smith said about helping homeless 
families. "I found a lot of need for homeless families so I wanted to do 
something to help them." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's troubles began in March, shortly after she assumed the lease for the 
shelter. She faced more than $22,000 in utility bills, mostly from the owner of 
an adult day-care center that shared part of the building until it closed in 
October, 1993. Smith negotiated with the Department of Water and Power to 
reduce the charges to $9,000, but the center has struggled to raise funds to 
pay the bill, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest blow came in April when the building's owner, Dr. Herbert Singer, 
gave Smith three days' notice to vacate the building, she said. After going to 
court in May, Smith was allowed to keep the shelter in the building until Sept. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 With no money and the end of the month quickly approaching, Smith said she is 
out on a limb again. Representatives for Assemblyman Willard Murray 
(D-Paramount), City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., Mayor Richard Riordan and 
County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke agreed to write letters to the 
building's owner requesting that the shelter be allowed to remain in the 
building until another location is found. LUCILLE RENWICK

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; HEALTH CENTER HIT BY BUDGET CUTS, LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Watts Health Foundation has laid off a tenth of its work force and will 
add a 24-hour urgent care center in a move to curb costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation laid off 100 employees Aug. 11 in the wake of a $36-million 
state budget cut in Medi-Cal health services. Administrators said state funding 
to the foundation could be cut by as much as $5 million in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Patient services will not be affected, said Dr. Clyde W. Oden Jr., president 
and chief executive officer of the organization. All the clinic's facilities 
will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 The only notable change for patients, he said, will be referrals. Patients who 
used to see specialists at the foundation will now be referred to the 
specialists' offices.  
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs will not affect the eligibility or benefits of 65,000 
Medi-Cal-supported enrollees in the United Health Plan, Oden said.  
</P>
<P>
 A 24-hour urgent care center is being established at the Watts Health Center 
to provide less costly alternatives for emergency services. It will open in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason to do this is we want to reduce the number of visits to the 
emergency room," Oden said. "It's a cost-cutting measure. Many of the patients 
seen are not emergency but urgent. They're not in life- and death-threatening 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators were left with no choice but to furlough employees after four 
years of budget cutbacks, Oden said. "It's a layoff of indefinite time," he 
said, "but it's not permanent. It will be for at least 18 months." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has been helping laid-off workers with job placement and 
referrals through internal and external agencies, Oden said. 
</P>
<P>
 For 21 years, the Watts Health Foundation has operated one of the state's 
largest, contracted prepaid health plans. It was founded two years after the 
1965 Watts riots as a federally funded community health center for local 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Watts Heath Foundation is an umbrella organization for two health centers, 
26 community health programs and services, and United Health Plan, the 
12th-largest HMO in Southern California. ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH; CITY SEEKS TIGHTER RULES ON SWAP MEETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After heavy debate over a proposed ordinance that some said would loosen 
regulations on swap meet operators, the City Council voted to send it back to 
committee for fine-tuning. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would allow some operators to run their swap meets without 
obtaining a conditional-use permit. Some council members vehemently objected to 
loosening restrictions because they say the proliferation of bazaars in South 
Los Angeles has spawned litter and traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease neighborhood congestion, the ordinance would require swap meets to 
provide five parking spaces for each 1,000 square feet of floor space, and 
restrict them to one vendor per 200 square feet. It would also exempt small 
swap meets in which six or fewer vendors occupy 45% of a property.  
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 14-0 to send the ordinance back to the Planning and Land 
Management Committee for further review. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Aug. 10 meeting, Councilwoman Rita Walters said "there are swap meets 
on top of swap meets" in her district, which includes South Los Angeles. 
Walters blamed swap meet vendors for contributing to the decay of 
neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 Howard Gantman, an aide to Walters, said the councilwoman regularly receives 
calls from residents around Vernon and Central avenues complaining about 
parking problems, noise, litter, loitering and increased crime surrounding a 
swap meet there. But Juan Castaneda, who manages the swap meet at the site, 
disputed those claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "The complaint (Walters) has with us is that we supposedly give a bad image to 
the city," Castaneda said. "But in an economically strapped area we are helping 
20 to 25 people work, people who want to work." 
</P>
<P>
 One South-Central vendor agreed that the swap meet helps the surrounding 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones that complain are the big businesses in the area, not the 
neighbors," said Ines Yanes, 35, an area resident who uses the Vernon-Central 
property to sell goods. "We serve the community with lower prices. We are not 
rich people, and our average shopper is also poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors at the corner swap meet pay $8 a day per lot and take home an average 
of $60 to $70. "And we pay taxes," Yanes said. "This is what we live off of."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; WORKSHOP ON ASIAN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A conference on domestic violence against women in the Asian culture will be 
held Saturday at Centenary United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the Asian Pacific Domestic Violence Conference is to inform 
social service groups, educators and others about the issue -- usually 
considered a "hidden problem" among Asian families, said Bonnie Tang, a staff 
attorney at the Asian Pacific American Legal Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal center and Network Against Asian Pacific Domestic Violence are 
sponsoring the conference from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the church, 300 S. 
Central Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing spousal abuse is often considered a cultural taboo among Asians, 
Tang said. Victims rarely file domestic violence reports.  
</P>
<P>
 "As a wife and a mother, you're taught to endure whatever happens in your 
family -- to not talk about it outside the family," said Yung Hae Kim, a 
victims' advocate with the city attorney's office who will be a panelist. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ELYSIAN VALLEY; FACTORY OWNER LOSES BID FOR PARKING 
LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a cleaning-solvent factory suffered another setback after a city 
zoning appeals board denied his bid to turn a vacant, 1.75-acre parcel into a 
25-space parking lot for employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," said Bob Rosenbaum, president of Mission Kleensweep 
Products Inc., after the hearing Tuesday."I've been trying very hard to do a 
good job for the community. We want to be a good corporate citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 "The people won," said an elated Virginia Adams, one of the Elysian Valley 
residents who led the drive to oppose a parking lot at 2428 Birkdale St., next 
to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents feared that a parking lot would enable Rosenbaum to expand his 
business, creating more noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum asked the Board of Zoning Appeals to overturn a zoning 
administrator's denial of the project earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his attorney said the lot would benefit the community by reducing the 
number of vehicles on residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum also reviewed a list of improvements he has made or is making to 
curb complaints about truck traffic, odor and noise from the factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 80 residents from Elysian Valley, Echo Park and other communities who 
oppose the company's plan packed the meeting. Some played a tape of what they 
said was constant grinding noise from the business, while others showed 
pictures of trucks lining residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he can appeal the board's decision to the City Council, Rosenbaum said 
he first plans to find ways to appease residents, while looking into the 
possibility of moving his company. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; BLOCK CONSIDERED FOR LANDMARK STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A city block that tells the history of early Japanese American life has been 
recommended for national landmark status, but final designation awaits a review 
of earthquake damage to the 1st Street buildings, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks pretty good," said Candice Kim, field deputy for Rep. Lucille 
Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 But first the National Park Service must determine whether to send an 
inspector to evaluate the 13 buildings in the Little Tokyo Historic District or 
to look over damage reports submitted to the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A landmark designation could boost property owners' chances to obtain more 
restoration funding for buildings in the district. The area encompasses the 
north side of 1st Street between Central Avenue and San Pedro Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Do Mar, a co-owner of the Far East Cafe building at 347 E. 1st St., is hoping 
for such a designation to improve his chances of receiving $400,000 in grants 
to pay for quake damage repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another grant applicant from the district, Tony Sperl, has opposed a landmark 
designation, saying it would hinder property owners' plans to develop their 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may want to tear my building down," said Sperl, whose building at 337-339 
1/2 1st St. suffered $120,000 damage in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1882 as a blacksmith shop, the Sperl Building is considered the 
oldest on the block, officials said. Other significant sites include the old 
Union Church at 120 N. San Pedro St., founded in 1918 and once used as a 
processing center for Japanese awaiting internment during World War II, and the 
old Nishi Hongwanji Buddhist Temple, now the Japanese American National Museum.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CHINATOWN; GATEWAY COULD HELP REVIVE AREA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 St. Louis prides itself on the Gateway Arch. San Francisco stands out with its 
Golden Gate Bridge. New York touts the Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Los Angeles' Chinatown may soon have its own monument to identify 
itself as a gateway to the city and the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and merchants have pledged up to $400,000 for construction of an 
entryway at North Broadway and Cesar E. Chavez Avenue. They envision a 16-foot 
bridge that stretches across Broadway, with neon lighting and topped by a 
pagoda. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea for this particular bridge is to identify Chinatown as an entrance 
to the community," said Don Toy, a Chinatown activist and representative of the 
Teo Chew Assn. "People don't know where Chinatown is and where it begins." 
</P>
<P>
 Teo Chew, the province in China from which some residents and merchants in the 
association had emigrated, is the name of the group spearheading the project. 
It started a pledge drive for the gateway late last year and has since 
attracted interest from 10 other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the project received formal support from the City Council, which 
instructed all city departments to cooperate with developers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although two gateways already stand outside Central Plaza -- the site of New 
Chinatown at a small section sandwiched by North Broadway and Hill Street -- 
Toy said new entryways are needed for visitors because the community's 
boundaries have expanded north toward Dodger Stadium and south toward Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Teo Chew Assn. members believe a new gateway facing Downtown could help 
revive Chinatown's struggling economy. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: CYPRESS PARK; PLAN FOR CONDOS AT LAWRY'S SITE OPPOSED

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to develop the Lawry's California Center that has been vacant for two 
years is facing stiff opposition from the community because the developer wants 
to build condominiums.  
</P>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles Community Union, or TELACU, which is seeking to buy the 
property and develop movie theaters, shops, offices and restaurants, as well as 
208 condominiums, has held three meetings for residents in the past two months 
to explain its plans and discuss the community's opposition.  
</P>
<P>
 The most recent meeting was Thursday at Lawry's, which the nonprofit developer 
has renamed the New California Center, 570 W. Avenue 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents do not want housing because the complex would be too dense for the 
neighborhood and units would not be priced low enough, community activist Art 
Pulido said.  
</P>
<P>
 About 120 residents met two weeks ago and voted unanimously against housing at 
the 17-acre site, Pulido said. Community support is crucial because without it, 
Councilman Mike Hernandez will not support the project, which is in his 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones who will ultimately speak there is the community," said Rafael 
Gonzalez, the councilman's senior field deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have asked TELACU officials to build a bank or store in place of the 
condominiums. They fear the project will open the door for the construction of 
dense, low-quality housing in their neighborhoods, Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
 TELACU has suggested reducing the number of housing units, but warns that 
fewer condos would mean higher prices, jeopardizing financing by the Community 
Redevelopment Agency.  
</P>
<P>
 Without the government subsidies, construction of the condominiums would be 
impossible, said Phil Martinez, TELACU project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 If a consensus can be reached with the community, Martinez expects permits to 
be approved within 60 days to start construction. 
</P>
<P>
 If the latest proposal for developing the site falls through, residents hope 
to form a committee to seek out developers who would preserve the center's 
gardens and architecture while meeting the needs of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that whatever comes into the community will complement 
the community," Pulido said. Developers "are there to make their money and 
(then) they're gone, and whatever they leave there we have to put up with."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to increase outreach and educational efforts in the Latino community, 
the American Diabetes Assn. will host classes next month to train bilingual 
volunteers in spreading the word about the causes and effects of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants may choose from two diabetes awareness programs to be offered 
Sept. 17 and 18 at USC University Hospital, 1500 San Pablo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diabetes Instructor Program will train volunteers to speak to community 
groups and organizations on diabetes and its prevalence in the Latino 
community. The program is a 15-hour training and certification course for 
bilingual volunteers who must commit to a minimum of six community 
presentations a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The second program, Consejeras de la Diabetes, coordinates in-home 
presentations to promote awareness about diabetes, risk factors for Latinos and 
community resources for diagnosis and treatment of the disease. It is an 
eight-hour training course, also for bilingual individuals, that requires a 
minimum commitment of six diabetes home "health parties" a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Diabetes prevents the body from making insulin, a hormone that converts sugar 
in food into energy. Instead, the sugar collects in the blood and urine, stalls 
body functions and hardens arteries. The disease can lead to blindness, heart 
or kidney disease, stroke or amputation.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 13 million people nationwide have diabetes, including 700,000 in Los 
Angeles County, according to the American Diabetes Assn. Latinos suffer the 
highest incidence rate in the county, with one in seven afflicted with the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Consejeras de la Diabetes training program will be held Sept. 17 from 8:30 
a.m. to 5 p.m. The Diabetes Instructor Program will be offered Sept. 17 and 18 
from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. both days. Participants in that program must attend 
both sessions.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; TARGET STORE IS HOST FOR POLICE CENTER 
</P>

<P>
 Carjacking prevention hint No. 8: If a suspicious person approaches your car, 
drive away quickly and carefully -- even if you must go through a red light. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move exemplifying cooperation between the private and public sectors, 
police last week opened a police information center in the busy parking lot of 
the Target store at 5700 Firestone Ave. to make crime prevention tips more 
readily available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, located in a trailer under the Target sign, will be open three or 
four days days a week, depending on staff availability, said Police Chief Ron 
George. In addition to providing residents with information on preventing 
crimes such as carjacking and kidnaping, the center will serve as a meeting 
point for area police, who can use the facility to prepare reports and 
communicate with headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff will also provide bicycle safety classes. Officers will not be able 
to detain crime suspects at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 At grand opening festivities Tuesday -- replete with beauty queens, area 
politicians and a police robot called Sparky -- George lauded the new center: 
"This is a win-win situation. The city wins, since its awareness of crime 
prevention increases, and Target wins, since it gains a police presence on its 
property," he said to 40 people on hand for the ribbon-cutting ceremony.  
</P>
<P>
 In the second experiment of this kind, Target is paying all of the police 
center's expenses. Last year, Long Beach police established a center at 
Target's store at 950 E. 33rd St. in that city. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: COMMERCE; HOME DEPOT STORE TO PROVIDE 200 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SIMON ROMERO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 200 new jobs will be available upon completion of a 105,000-square-foot 
Home Depot store being built at Telegraph Road and Garfield Avenue. 
Construction of the household goods and building supply store is expected to be 
completed by October. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Depot spokeswoman Nell Parker said the store will begin hiring two months 
before opening. Parker said the store has a policy of hiring its employees from 
the surrounding community.  
</P>
<P>
 Justin McCarthy, regional director for the city's redevelopment commission, 
said Home Depot officials chose the location because of its high visibility 
next to the Santa Ana Freeway and the city's utility and gross-receipts taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a perfect fit," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $2 million in annual sales tax revenue estimated by Home Depot 
officials, $300,000 will go to the city, McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Depot, based in Atlanta, is leasing the 8.7-acre location from the Sbicca 
family, which operated American Foundry at the site. Founded in 1920 by Dominic 
Sbicca, the foundry melted down old engines and produced cast-iron fittings 
until it closed in 1988.  
</P>

 Manufacturing accounts for 24% of the 1,800 businesses based in Commerce, down 
from 45% 10 years ago. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WESTLAKE; JOB PROGRAM TO AID 14- TO 30-YEAR-OLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an area where opportunities for teens and young adults are sometimes hard 
to find, city, school, business and community representatives recently 
announced the launching of Youth Fair Chance, a federally funded job training 
program that will benefit local 14- to 30-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers -- who include the city, the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, 
Rebuild L.A., the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Ketchum Downtown 
YMCA -- are already at work obtaining job listings and developing training 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Development Department, with the assistance of Councilman Mike 
Hernandez's office, prepared the proposal for the $3-million Department of 
Labor grant, which was awarded to the city in late June and will fund the 
program for 18 months. An additional $1 million in federal funds will be 
disbursed annually for the following three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Once job listings are obtained and the program kicks off with enrollment in 
October, high school students and graduates in need of work will be trained for 
the positions. Tony Perez, press deputy for Hernandez, said this creates a more 
efficient system of job placement.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to solicit jobs as opposed to training people for something 
that's not really out there," he said. "We're saying, 'Give us the job slots 
first, then we'll have a constant pool of people.' " 
</P>
<P>
 College-bound students in search of part-time work will not be ignored, said 
Ken Suto, a career adviser for Belmont High School, which will sponsor 
in-school training. But the target population for Youth Fair Chance is young 
people graduating from high school and looking immediately for work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose of this grant is to make sure that kids who are not going 
to college will have jobs when they graduate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said emphasis will be placed on jobs in higher-paying high-technology 
fields, so that the youths aren't relegated to the low-paying jobs that are 
sometimes the only option open to unskilled, non-college graduates.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, what we're doing is preparing a population base for those 
high-tech jobs," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Flores, director of Youth and Employment Services with the Community 
Development Department, said a waiting list of job-trainee hopefuls is already 
growing. LESLIE BERESTEIN

HAITI MEMORIES; SEARCHING FOR A NEW LIFE, HUNDREDS OF REFUGEES HAVE ARRIVED IN 
L.A. WITH THEIR STORIES OF DESPAIR AND BRUTAL TREATMENT BACK HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1991, as military thugs ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide as 
that country's first democratically elected president, droves of citizens 
started fleeing Haiti for political reprieve in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands have ended up in the United States, and hundreds of those 
refugees have come to Los Angeles in search of a new, safer life. Here, the 
Haitians cope with language barriers that isolate them from a populace that 
generally knows little of their language or culture and struggle to find work. 
Meanwhile, they await word on whether they will be granted political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 U.S. Census counted 2,781 Haitians, including recent refugees as well 
as long-time immigrants, in Southern California, spread from Orange and San 
Bernardino counties to various parts of Los Angeles County. But Gilbert 
Perpignand, president of the board of the Crenshaw-based Haitian Community 
Refugee Center, said many Haitians did not check off their nationality on 
census forms and estimated that at least 5,000 live in Los Angeles, Orange and 
San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 live in the city of Los Angeles, Perpignand said, with 
significant clusters in Van Nuys and Inglewood. About 300 Haitians were 
resettled in Los Angeles -- as well as other cities -- with the help of 
Catholic Charities to disperse the refugees from more common destinations such 
as Miami and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees have brought to Los Angeles little more than stories of 
incredible despair in one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. 
But even more disturbing are accounts of torture as bad, if not worse, than 
anything inflicted during the regime of former dictator Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) 
Duvalier.  
</P>
<P>
 "Your average Haitian today has suffered much more egregious persecution than 
in the 1980s," said Neil Frenzen, an attorney with the public interest law firm 
Public Counsel who specializes in political asylum cases. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, Haitians in Los Angeles are cautious about what they say 
about their homeland. They fear what the military regime might do to their 
families who are still in their own country if their protests somehow make 
their way back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, people won't talk too much about politics, because they're afraid 
of things getting back to Haiti," Perpignand said. "Some also worry that saying 
the wrong thing could ruin their chances of gaining asylum." 
</P>
<P>
 The following are pieces of the lives of a few Haitian refugees, who at one 
time or another relied on the Haitian Community Refugee Center to help them 
adjust after the struggles that forced them to leave Haiti and to their 
sometimes awkward transitions to life in Los Angeles. 
</P>

 Yves can never forget Haiti. If his memory ever fails him, the raised scars 
sliced through his back will remind him of his country, plagued by a brutal 
government that has been accused of random torture and killing. 
</P>
<P>
 For a number of years before the 30-year-old man fled Haiti for the United 
States two years ago, he was beaten, stabbed, cut with machetes and had his 
life threatened repeatedly by soldiers and government supporters, he said. All 
because he followed the orders of a priest for whom he was working and 
supported the National Front for Change and Democracy (FNCD), an umbrella 
organization started in 1987 that joined 64 unions and social and political 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I protested against Duvalier and later was an Aristide supporter. That's why 
the police gave me a hard time," said Yves, who asked that his last name not be 
used to spare his family in Haiti any trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A short, beefy man with closely shorn hair and thick hands, Yves speaks of 
Haiti in bittersweet tones. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, when he was 18 and living in an impoverished section of 
Port-au-Prince, Yves started working for a priest at St. Joseph's Church in the 
city. He helped distribute food to the city's indigent and was able to make 
some money to get ahead. But the job also pitted Yves against poor Haitians who 
demanded to be given some of the free food. 
</P>
<P>
 At various times, these people tried to pummel him, he said. He recalled 
beatings, arrests, days in jail for no reason and death threats, some at the 
hands of police, others from people assisted by the militia. The worst assault 
was in February, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Yves, 20 civilians burst into the priest's home wielding knives, 
guns and machetes. Yves said he stepped between them and the priest to protect 
the vicar. He was cut on the chin and chest, but the most severe wounds were 
the machete slashes to Yves' back -- nearly half a dozen -- that have left 
prominent scars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police called me a troublemaker because I was trying to do good," Yves 
said. "They didn't like that." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year later, in April, 1992, with rumored death threats against 
him, Yves was urged by a friend to leave Haiti. Without a word to his parents 
and siblings, Yves boarded a boat from Port-au-Prince bound for Miami at 4 
a.m., paying his fare with five buckets of pasta he received from the church, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the boat, when a Haitian was in trouble for allegedly stealing money from 
crew members, Yves said he was asked to help the man. His benevolence nearly 
cost him his life. Yves said crew members of the boat pushed him overboard, 
possibly in an attempt to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 After swimming for what felt like an hour, Yves was rescued by another group 
of Haitian boat people. Both boats were seized by the U.S. Coast Guard and 
taken to the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where Yves spent 
nearly two months before being screened by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. He was finally sent to Los Angeles in July, 1992, by Catholic 
Charities. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives in Inglewood and is studying English to take the General Equivalency 
Diploma exam. But ultimately, Yves hopes to return to Haiti once -- and if -- 
Aristide is returned to power. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dream of my country," Yves said in broken English. "I am born (in) Haiti. 
This is my country. I dream of my country." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 There are still times when Estella Fleury dreams of her 6-month-old son -- 
seeing his face or hearing him coo. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she remembers the gunshots allegedly fired by members of the notorious 
Tontons Macoutes hit squad that riddled her shanty home in Port-au-Prince -- 
particularly the bullet that killed her son while he was lying in bed with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years after the incident, Fleury, sitting in a gold velour-covered chair 
in her sparse Van Nuys apartment and cradling her 10-day-old daughter, Sheri, 
recalls the incidents that forced her to flee Haiti for her life. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '80s and into 1990, Fleury was a strong supporter of the FNCD 
party in Haiti, which promoted more democracy in the country and included 
Aristide as one of its members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tontons Macoutes "knew where Aristide supporters were and they would go 
after them and shoot at them," Fleury, 26, said in Creole.  
</P>
<P>
 The first attack was in early 1990 when her son was killed. The second assault 
was later that year during a pro-Aristide meeting in wealthy Petionville, just 
outside Port-au-Prince. Government supporters, allegedly supplied with weapons 
by the police, burst into the meeting and started beating people -- Fleury 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks continued in 1991, when attackers -- also allegedly Tontons 
Macoutes -- broke into Fleury's home and beat her mercilessly, she said. She 
was three months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks after the incident, Fleury returned to her birthplace, La Gonave, a 
Haitian island that lies about 62 miles off the country's mainland. It was on 
her return to La Gonave in late 1991 -- on a boat that took three days to get 
there -- that Fleury decided to flee to America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't care where I went because I knew (the Tontons Macoutes) would kill 
me. I just wanted to get out of Haiti," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boat on which she escaped was intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard and sent 
to Guantanamo Bay. Fleury spent eight days in the hospital with pregnancy 
complications from the beatings she suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1992, with the help of Catholic Charities, Fleury arrived in Los 
Angeles and was resettled in Van Nuys. She spent her first eight days here in a 
hospital, again because of problems with her pregnancy stemming from the 1991 
beating. She gave birth to a girl, Marjorie, now a rambunctious 19-month-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleury said her life here is clearly better than it was in Haiti. She said she 
hopes the United States goes through with its military intervention plan 
against the government of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras. But even if that goes through 
and succeeds, Fleury said she is skeptical of what positive progress it will 
bring to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see much of a future for Haiti right now," Fleury said solemnly 
through an interpreter. "They always talk about changes, but nothing ever 
happens and the little people are always getting killed. Maybe if the Americans 
go in, it will be better." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When he stepped off a plane in Los Angeles in March, 1992, Laguerre Fresnel 
thought his life would be transformed into one of prosperity. At 18, he hoped 
to find work, learn English and be rid of the political pressures he endured in 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at 20, Fresnel is unemployed and shares an apartment with a woman with 
nine children, often sleeping on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought my life would get better, but now it's worse because I'm not 
working," Fresnel said in his lilting Haitian Creole as a volunteer translated. 
</P>
<P>
 For most Haitians in Los Angeles, finding work is one of their greatest 
hurdles, according to the Haitian Community Refugee Center, which helps 
refugees find work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even at such a young age, Fresnel looks worn, perhaps from years of worrying 
and struggle in Haiti. Fresnel says little about his life in Haiti. When asked 
why he fled his country, "political problems" is all he'll say in response. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresnel hails from Dame-Marie, a small spot near the coastal town of Jeremie, 
the point of departure for hundreds of Haitians fleeing the country for better 
prospects in America. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dame-Marie, Fresnel worked packing fish for export to the United States. He 
was hoping to get a similar job when he arrived in the United States after 
spending six months in Guantanamo Bay after the boat he was on was seized by 
the Coast Guard in November, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a choice or notice, he was resettled in Los Angeles by Catholic 
Charities and sent straight to Ventura County for one year to cut and pack 
flowers for a company in Somis along with a handful of other Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 The job was OK, but it was only temporary. Besides, Fresnel explains, he 
couldn't work and go to school at the same time to learn English. Right now, he 
stumbles along with the little English he knows, but mainly relies on staff and 
volunteers at the Haitian Community Refugee Center for help and converses with 
other Haitians in the city.  
</P>
<P>
 "Life would be better if I would be able to go to school . . . to learn a 
trade, something that I can learn for the future," Fresnel said. "I could get 
training in telephone repair, anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Catholic Charities set Fresnel up in an apartment on Dalton 
Street and gave him $450, which lasted for one month. After that ran out, 
Fresnel went on welfare and discontinued it each time he found a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresnel said he doesn't like welfare. A job is really what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresnel has kept the address on Dalton Street for the past 1 1/2 years, but in 
recent months he has been staying with other Haitians -- wherever he can find 
someone to put him up until he can afford to help pay the rent.  
</P>
<P>
 With the help of the Haitian Center, Fresnel has found a few jobs, all of 
which lasted some months, but never long enough to get him on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Fresnel sat for hours in a Spartan office at the 
Haitian Center with a volunteer, poring over business cards and contacts of job 
prospects scribbled on sheets of yellow legal pad. 
</P>
<P>
 If he doesn't find work here after a while, Fresnel said he'll move to Miami, 
where his brother lives. In the meantime, he will look for work and hope for 
the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can find work, things will be better for me," Fresnel said. "I wouldn't 
have to leave."

CRENSHAW CENTER HELPS HAITIAN REFUGEES CHART THEIR COURSE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At 1:30 p.m. on a recent weekday afternoon, the Haitian Community Refugee 
Center is abuzz with the sound of lilting Creole from refugees, interpreters 
and workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Spartan front office, two Haitian men talk and laugh with executive 
director Gerry Gaspard about jobs and other issues of life in Los Angeles, 
their home for about two years. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Haitians recently fleeing the political strife in their country and 
venturing to the unknown in Los Angeles, the Haitian Community Refugee Center 
gives them more than a little feeling of home. It is a lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The center is a haven for these Haitians," said Maggie Barnes, who volunteers 
at the organization as a translator. "They feel safe there and can trust 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian Center -- as it is commonly called -- opened in 1985 in a small 
office of a rundown law office building far in the back of the Santa Barbara 
Plaza off Buckingham Street in the Crenshaw area. Its purpose is to help 
Haitians trickling into Los Angeles from Haiti and the refugee camps of 
Guantanamo Bay adjust to life in this sprawling metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 With a scant Haitian population in Los Angeles and no other organizations with 
workers or volunteers who speak Haitian Creole, the center has become the 
gathering spot for newly arrived Haitians and even those who have been here for 
a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to create an infrastructure to give (the Haitians) a sense of 
community, a place for them to feel like their home," said Gaspard, a native of 
Haiti and head of the center since April.  
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Charities has resettled 200 Haitians in Los Angeles since 1991 
through a program supervised by the U.S. Catholic Conference, which contracted 
with the U.S. Department of Justice. The missionary organization set the 
refugees up with housing and temporary jobs and helped them start the 
application process for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it opened, the Haitian Center has helped about 150 Haitians learn 
English, find jobs and housing and understand the mass transit system.  
</P>
<P>
 It is also a place where Haitian refugees know there are people who understand 
their culture, their language and their plight, and possibly where they can 
connect with other Haitians throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the center's primary objective is helping refugees gain asylum in 
the United States, said Gilbert Perpignand, president of the center's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Haitians who have come to Los Angeles since 1991 are living on 
kind of a "parole" status. They have been granted temporary permission to enter 
the country while they press their bids for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 So they are not legal refugees, but neither are they illegal immigrants, said 
Neil Frenzen, an attorney with Public Counsel, who is providing legal 
assistance to the refugees for their asylum requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 50 or so asylum applications Frenzen has filed since the summer of 
1992, only six or seven have been granted, he said. Others are caught in a 
backlog that could last two years, he said.

GONZALEZ STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS; AFTER LEADING THE CENTRAL CITY IN PASSING 
YARDAGE AS A JUNIOR, WILSON QB WON'T BE ABLE TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Eddie Gonzalez can no longer hide behind the cloak of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's cinematic super-hero impersonation last season was to the T: 
performing wondrous deeds on the football field for Wilson High while remaining 
a mystery to much of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the quarterback led the area in passing yardage as a junior, he will 
be one of the Central City's high-profile football players this season. 
</P>
<P>
 That is Gonzalez's new role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to show other people who I am and what I can do," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a reason Gonzalez established a low-profile image last year: Wilson 
started the 1993 football season with three consecutive shutout losses. 
Gonzalez passed for three yards in the 32-0 season opening loss to South Gate, 
and the following week he left the game in the second quarter with an injured 
ankle in a 20-0 drubbing at the hands of Salesian. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez sat out the third game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beginning of last season was really tough," Gonzalez said, "but I knew 
things would turn around." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as happens in the movies, adversity made the hero stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wilson's fifth game, against Hollywood, Gonzalez bounced back to complete 
14 of 24 passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns to give the Mules their first 
win, 47-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson continued to draw poor reviews as a team, winning only two of 
11 games, Gonzalez solidified his star status, leading the area with 1,623 
total yards. In his best performance of the season, Gonzalez threw for 280 
yards and one touchdown in Wilson's 40-14 loss to Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "(As a quarterback) all the responsibility is on me," Gonzalez said. "Whether 
or not the team has a good day is up to me." 
</P>
<P>
 And like every hero, it's only fitting that Gonzalez have a sidekick. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Buster Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, a 5-10, 155-pound utility player, is one of the area's top athletes. 
He showed his versatility in the game against Hollywood, scoring four 
touchdowns, two on interception returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley led Wilson with 60 points last year and was among the top 20 local 
scorers. He played wide receiver, running back and defensive back but will be 
Gonzalez's primary target this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of confidence in Buster catching the ball and in what he does 
afterward," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said that he is best as a wideout: "I play the receiver position 
better than tailback or defensive back. I am a natural running patterns and 
catching passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez and Bradley, both seniors, have displayed their ability to combine 
for the big play. Bradley, who caught 30 passes for 572 yards and six 
touchdowns, scored on passes from Gonzalez of 32, 40, 56 and 83 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I catch a pass I think, 'touchdown,' " Bradley said. "I think to 
myself, 'I'm better than this guy guarding me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bradley, Gonzalez is small for his position, at 5-foot-9 and 140 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But fewer acts in the Central City are bigger.  
</P>
<P>
 "I sit back in the pocket, read, wait for the passing window, step and throw," 
the right-hander said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bradley, a three-year varsity starter, has nothing but raves for his 
quarterback: "Eddie has good timing, movement and a good arm." This mutual 
admiration and hours of extra practice have made comrades of the two.  
</P>
<P>
 "Last season, we accounted for 80% of the offense, so we talk about what we 
need to work on, like pass patterns and timing," Gonzalez said. "We are good 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley agreed: "We work on new plays and patterns so that everything is 
perfect for the game. That has brought us closer together." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that this tandem has earned individual successes, they hope to make 
Wilson's 1994 act a blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gonzalez: "The team looks good and has the attitude. In the first round 
of this year's playoffs, I want to beat a 4-A team like Sylmar." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some other quarterbacks and receivers expected to raise their 
profiles during the 1994 City high school football season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Regan, Los Angeles -- The 5-9, 160-pound Regan is the second-leading 
passer in total yardage among returnees from last season. Regan completed 73 of 
158 pass attempts for 992 yards and nine touchdowns. In a game against 
Westchester, Regan led the team in rushing with 64 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Vasquez, South Gate -- Vasquez was a pleasant surprise in an otherwise 
disappointing 1993 Rams season. He passed for 642 yards and four touchdowns, 
completing 37 of 95 attempts. The 5-10, 165-pound signal caller will once again 
have the luxury of throwing to two of the area's top receivers in tight end 
Mark Redoval and flanker Eddie Montez. 
</P>
<P>
 Amar Brisco, Washington -- Unfortunately for Washington, Brisco will not have 
the fastest receiver in the Central City to throw to as he did last year in Jim 
McElroy. Brisco threw for only 398 yards and three touchdowns, but he averaged 
12.9 yards per completion.  
</P>
<P>
 Kyle Speilbueler, Loyola -- Speilbueler is one of the many question marks 
facing the Cubs, who were weakened by senior graduation. He completed only 
three passes all of last year, but Speilbueler has a very strong arm and knows 
Loyola's system after serving as Bobby Thomason's understudy. Even though he is 
not battle-tested, the 6-1, 170-pound Speilbueler is worth noting, as Loyola is 
known for its quarterback development. 
</P>
<P>
 Other quarterbacks to watch are Fremont's Robert Loera and Hassan Bailey of 
Locke. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Montez, South Gate -- Montez was Vasquez's favorite target last season, 
catching 21 passes for 386 yards and four touchdowns. The 6-2, 180-pound Montez 
is a possession receiver but has the speed to stretch out a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Freddie Alcala, Bell -- Alcala is Bell's money man. He led the team in catches 
(23), receiving yardage (434) and touchdown receptions (five). He will be 
featured heavily in Bell's offense along with tight end Dicky Purcell. Alcala 
is 5-9, 165 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Dicky Purcell, Bell -- Purcell is one of the top tight ends in the area. The 
6-2, 215-pounder led local tight ends in receiving with 16 catches for 324 
yards and two touchdowns. At 6-2, 215 pounds, Purcell has very good hands and 
deceptive speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Boykins, Manual Arts -- Boykins wasn't featured in Manual Arts' 
offense last season, but he still led the Toilers with six catches for 137 
yards and two touchdowns. Boykins played mostly tight end last season but will 
see more time at flanker. The 6-foot, 175-pound Boykins has good speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalonte Walker, Fremont -- Walker is a converted running back. The 5-10, 
175-pound junior was the Pathfinders' second-leading rusher with 38 carries for 
232 yards and a touchdown. This makes him extremely dangerous after the catch. 
Walker also caught three passes for 48 yards and a touchdown. He will play a 
bigger role for Fremont this season.

NOTEBOOK; GRID CLASSIC WILL STAY AT SAME OLD SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles Classic will be played again at East L.A. College. At 
least for one more year. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual football game between Garfield and Roosevelt high schools at East 
L.A. College had been rumored to be moved to the Rose Bowl for several years, 
but corporate sponsorship to meet the Rose Bowl's $158,000 rental fee has not 
materialized for the Nov. 4 game. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred N. Sanchez, a 1959 Garfield alumnus who is spearheading the campaign to 
move the game to the Rose Bowl, believes fund-raising efforts were hindered by 
this summer's World Cup, which had drained the pocketbooks of potential 
sponsors who had committed to the soccer competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, however, is already working on plans for a move to the Rose Bowl in 
1995, and said Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Bank of America have shown interest in 
sponsoring the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have liked to play at the Rose Bowl this year, but it looks like 
1995 will be the year," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The game typically generates $40,000 to $50,000 in revenue, split equally 
between the high schools, and serves as the primary fund-raiser for the 
school's athletic programs. Proceeds from last year's game were also used to 
outfit Garfield's 220-member band with new uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be out selling candy to make money if it weren't for this game," 
Garfield Principal Maria Tostado said. 
</P>
<P>
 The homecoming game for Garfield and Roosevelt, which began in 1926, has been 
played at East L.A. College for the past 22 years. But there are concerns the 
event has outgrown the 22,000-seat Weingart Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 fans must watch from outside the stadium gates because of lack of 
seating. An additional several thousand, many with advance tickets, are also 
turned away each year. 
</P>
<P>
 East L.A. charges the high schools about $20,000 to cover the cost of 
security, electricity and cleanup and the college keeps the profits from 
concessions. This year's Classic forced an East L.A. men's soccer match to be 
rescheduled and past contests have created conflict with other college events, 
a fact that has angered East L.A. Athletic Director Gil Rozadilla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to take an interest in how it affects East L.A. College," Rozadilla 
said. "It's our stadium, and our athletic events should take precedence." 
</P>
<P>
 A move to the 100,000-seat Rose Bowl would also alleviate parking and traffic 
congestion at East L.A. College, which has 500 parking spaces. Plans are also 
under way to arrange for shuttle buses from the Eastside to Pasadena. Sanchez 
believes the game could attract 40,000 in the game's first year at the Rose 
Bowl and as many as 70,000 by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game has grown this big by just word of mouth," Sanchez said. "With some 
marketing, this could become the biggest Latino event in the country." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Willie Brown, a four-time Pro Bowl defensive back with the Oakland Raiders, 
has been named football coach at Jordan High and will also teach at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who coached at Long Beach State, worked as a volunteer assistant at 
Jordan last year. He takes over a program that has won only one game over the 
past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "In college, you know your players will show up because they're on 
scholarship," Brown said. "I just hope we have enough players show up to play a 
game. In the inner city, a lot of guys have to work to support their families."
