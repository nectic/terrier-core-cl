SLAUGHTER IN PARADISE: YACHT MURDERS HAUNT ANTIGUA; CARIBBEAN: FOR MANY ON 
TOURISM-DEPENDENT ISLAND, THE FRIGHTENING ASPECT OF THE SLAYINGS IS FINANCIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This has not been a good season for a place that bills itself as a Caribbean 
oasis where guests pay as much as $1,700 a day for sun and tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 For their money, tourists seeking refuge from London damp and Manhattan snow 
instead got rain nearly every day this week, along with clouds that hid the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there were the murders, what some here are calling "slaughter in 
paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain will stop and the clouds will blow away," Alan Jeyes, hotel owner 
and yachtsman, said of the unusual bad weather. "But the killings -- I'm afraid 
they're going to be a blight for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The killings: On Jan. 29, four people, two originally from California, were 
found dead on a richly appointed 65-foot, two-masted yacht as it lay at anchor 
just off an isolated beach of the neighboring island of Barbuda. 
</P>
<P>
 Police announced Friday that they had arrested an unidentified 22-year-old 
Barbudan and that two other men were being sought in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Supt. Michael Lawrence from London's Scotland Yard said the apparent 
motive for the killing was robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether solved or not, the murders -- the victims were bound, gagged and shot 
execution-style -- are the first multiple killings in Antigua's history. 
</P>
<P>
 They have stunned and frightened this tiny Caribbean nation, which lives 
almost totally on the money spent by the 500,000 upscale tourists who come 
every year -- most of them at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 There is much to be frightened about. As with nearly all of the minuscule 
island nations left behind by European colonial masters, Antigua is nearly 
totally dependent on the whims of tourists, mostly from the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 70% of Antigua's gross domestic product, the measure of the country's 
economic wealth, comes directly from tourism and provides the population with 
one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean.  
</P>
<P>
 Since most of the islands offer the same thing -- warm weather in the winter 
months of North America and Europe, blue water and fine sand beaches -- 
Antiguans seek a competitive edge in other, intangible ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than go for offering high-volume cheap tours or low prices as do some, 
or easy sex and gambling as do others, Antigua lures guests with some of the 
best harbors in the world and assurances of exclusivity. 
</P>
<P>
 While some other Caribbean islands contend with racial tensions between local 
dark-skinned have-nots and visiting white haves, Antigua boasts of friendly 
citizens who always smile when they say "hello" and "thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure that there is little to offend, there are few long-haired 
backpackers; facilities are fancy and prices too high. 
</P>
<P>
 Few working-class people or couples with large packs of little children come 
to vacation where tourist guides list hotels in the $300-per-person per-day 
range as "moderate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Above all, what we offer is a beach for every day" says Tourism Minister 
Rodney Williams, referring to Antigua's 365 beaches, "sun and tranquillity -- 
and that includes safety." 
</P>
<P>
 So the brutal deaths of two wealthy tourists and what initially seemed to be 
slow and clumsy police work have put everyone on edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday's announcement, the investigation had been confusing, full of 
contradictory and often erroneous police statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of thing that could send them (the tourists) all off to 
Anguilla," says Alberto Ravenello, owner of an expensive Italian restaurant, 
referring to a rival resort island that also caters to the very wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Commented one New Jersey executive who was spending $800 a night for a month's 
stay at the Curtain Bluff resort, where the clientele is mainly elderly and 
white and where the men wear coats and ties each night for dinner: 
</P>
<P>
 "I come here every year because it is safe and I don't have to worry about 
feeling guilty or being threatened because I want to live well. If I can't have 
peace of mind and the lifestyle I want, if I can't go sailing or out to dinner 
at night without worrying about it, then there are many other places to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antigua is nice, but I don't owe it anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he added: "I think these killings were a one-time thing; at least, I 
expect so, and I'm planning on coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 The executive might not be so casual if he knew that Antigua is in the middle 
of what appears to be a crime wave, at least in local terms. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not Los Angeles or Miami -- or even Grand Island, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year there were five murders in this nation of 60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last two months, the head of Antiguan Customs was killed in 
circumstances so mysterious that the detectives from Scotland Yard were called 
in to help the investigation. A prominent shopkeeper was murdered. Then came 
the four on the yacht. And on Feb. 14, an unidentified man was killed, some say 
by the police in shady circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to mention at least two robberies of visitors golfing on one of 
Antigua's most exclusive courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these crimes have been kept from the public. The radio and television 
stations are owned or controlled by the government, as are the 
large-circulation newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the government and the resort owners) don't want people to know," said 
Tim Hector, Antigua's most prominent political dissident and publisher of the 
independent weekly newspaper, the Outlet. "So they suppress all the bad news." 
</P>
<P>
 Or else they blame it on immigrants from nearby islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "All them killings, them golf robberies," claimed tourist guide Denley Henley, 
were done by Jamaican Rastafarians, "or Dominicans." 
</P>
<P>
 But the yacht murders have been too big to keep under wraps, particularly 
because the victims were from very sensitive groups: rich tourists and the 
sailing community. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were William Clever, 58, his wife, Kathleen, 50, the yacht's 
33-year-old captain, Ian Cridland, and crewman Tom Williams, 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clevers, Americans from the Sacramento area, had lived abroad for a 
quarter of a century, sailing the world and operating a yacht-chartering 
service in France before moving to Britain. Clever's last job was as an 
executive in a company developing an estate on one of the Channel Islands in 
the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cridland and Williams were British, although they spent much of the time 
in this southern Antiguan port village, one of the premier sailing centers in 
the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 The million-dollar-plus yacht they were sailing, the Computacenter Challenger, 
is owned by Peter Ogden, Clever's boss in the estate development company and 
owner of one of Britain's largest computer dealerships, Computacenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clevers were taking a sailing vacation on the yacht as a gift from Ogden, 
friends here said. 
</P>
<P>
 They and the two crewmen were well known in the bars and wealthy resorts and 
restaurants that dot the pink sandy beaches of Antigua and Barbuda. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of Friday's arrest, little is known or being admitted about what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Theories, speculation and rumors -- lots of rumors -- are still making the 
rounds: The crew was running drugs. The boat was being used to carry drugs 
without anyone on board knowing. The four victims were silenced because they 
saw an airplane drop drugs that were picked up by another boat. And -- the 
theory possibly borne out by Friday's arrest -- just plain robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 This much is known: According to police and residents, the Computacenter 
Challenger left Nelson's Dockyard, a national park used as a marina by some of 
the world's largest and fanciest boats, on Jan. 29. They were to be gone six 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Mysteriously, at least in the minds of several dockyard regulars, one or 
perhaps two other scheduled guests failed to make the sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days later, a passing sailor noticed the Computacenter Challenger sitting 
at anchor in 20 feet of water at Low Bay, one of the many lonely and unoccupied 
beaches of Barbuda. Low Bay is about 15 miles from Antigua but close to a 
resort that boasts a $1,700-a-day suite. 
</P>
<P>
 His curiosity piqued by the location -- a boat as large as the Computacenter 
Challenger should have been in deeper water -- and by the yacht's open hatches, 
the passer-by clambered on board. 
</P>
<P>
 What he found was horrible. Four badly decomposed bodies, the men in 
undershorts, Kathleen Clever in a night shirt, were lying on the floor of the 
main cabin. Their hands had been tied behind their backs, their mouths gagged 
with duct tape. Police theorize that they had been sitting at a table when they 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 That is about as definite as the police have been. Even in announcing the 
arrest, Lawrence, one of seven Scotland Yard detectives working on the case, 
provided no more details about the actual murders. 
</P>
<P>
 And the investigation itself appeared sketchy, at best. 
</P>
<P>
 The first report from police said the four people had been stabbed and 
mutilated. That prompted talk that the four had been tortured before being 
killed, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
 A later autopsy showed they had all been shot, Clever in the back and side, 
his wife once in the back, Cridland in the chest and Williams in the head and 
back. There were no stab wounds, no mutilations. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining exactly what happened was hampered when Antiguan police sailed the 
yacht to the capital, St. John's, without securing the scene of the killings. 
When the boat arrived after plowing through rough seas, the bodies and other 
evidence had been tossed about. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the island speculation centers on a connection to the drug trade in 
the eastern Caribbean, where both British and American narcotics experts say 
Colombian cocaine dealers have been increasingly active. 
</P>
<P>
 These experts say there is no evidence that the boat had been used in running 
drugs or that the Clevers and the crewmen had any involvement in the drug 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector, the dissident and newspaper publisher who has good sources in the 
government and with the police, said one likely scenario was that the four 
witnessed a drug transaction and were killed to keep them silent. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug experts say the most prevalent narcotic transaction involves 
airplanes dropping bales of cocaine into the seas near Antigua, where 
black-painted speedboats known as stealth boats recover them, passing them over 
to larger mother ships or smuggling them into nearby poorly policed ports. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could happen to any of us," said Judy Harrison, an American bartender 
who has lived here for 15 years. "We all see things that are strange. It really 
makes me nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Ravenello, the wife of restaurant owner Alberto, feels the same way.  
</P>
<P>
 "Today we saw a strange ship sail into a harbor where no one ever goes," she 
said. "I got out of there in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the arrest, Antigua's police commissioner, Edric Potter, and 
Detective Supt. Michael Williamson, another of the Scotland Yard officers, said 
they had always discounted the drug connection as well as speculation about a 
sex crime or a business deal gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked from the start on the theory that it was robbery," Potter said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said investigators found some travelers checks and cigars that were 
traced back to the yacht, as well as some other items that he declined to 
identify, which were buried on the beach near the yacht's anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
 However, questions remain. Williamson would not comment, but other sources 
said large amounts of valuable jewelry were left on board and wallets were 
found containing money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," said Jeyes, the hotelier, when contacted after the arrest 
announcement. "If it were a robbery, why was so much stuff left on the boat? It 
is still very, very unsettling."

COLUMN ONE; CULTURE: A RUSSIAN TRAGEDY; ARTISTS ARE REELING FROM SOVIET-ERA 
DEVASTATION. THEY ARE CONFUSED BY THEIR NEW FREEDOM AND CRIPPLED BY THE 
WITHDRAWAL OF STATE SUBSIDIES. BUT A NEW AND UNPREDICTABLE GENERATION IS SLOWLY 
BLOOMING.

<P>
 The good news for culture fans on the Aeroflot flight here from Moscow is that 
the flight attendants hawk books rather than projecting cinematic tripe. The 
bad news is that the only books they offered recently were a British 
bodice-ripper and a tome of home-grown soft-core porn called "The Lascivious 
Priest." 
</P>
<P>
 This in the country that gave the world Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov -- and on 
the way to what Russia calls its "Cultural Capital." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Petersburg still floats in a lofty atmosphere of art and literature, from 
the classical columns of the pastel palaces lining its canals to the quotes 
from Pushkin that the locals drop into their conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, creators and critics say, Russian culture, for all its past and 
potential greatness, is still reeling from Soviet-era devastation. 
Paradoxically, with the fall of the Soviet regime, it also finds itself 
confused by its new freedom and crippled by the withdrawal of state subsidies. 
Only slowly, haltingly, is it feeling its way forward to some possible, 
unpredictable new blooming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russian culture is truly a great culture because it has made global 
achievements in art, literature and music, (in) painting, the Russian 
avant-garde . . . ," said Dmitri Likhachev, an 87-year-old literary historian 
who is to culture here what Andrei D. Sakharov was to human rights, an 
irreproachable figure of moral authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russian culture can't go from great to small," said Likhachev, seated in his 
high-ceilinged office beneath portraits of Pushkin, Lermontov and Turgenev. 
"But real Russian culture can be crushed -- if the libraries are destroyed and 
if there is general illiteracy." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is just the direction that the country is heading in, many Russians 
worry aloud. Government budgets that supported whole stables of ideologically 
correct writers, artists and performers have shrunk to pitiful sums. Much of 
the country's creative elite, even as it condemns the horrible damage that 
Soviet-era repression did by silencing, exiling, imprisoning and even killing 
nonconformists, is now wringing its hands at the ruthlessness of the raw 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the outburst of creativity that many expected when the Soviet 
regime collapsed, many writers and artists find themselves floundering. Some 
who opposed the regime lack inspiration now that they have nothing to fight, 
and many who supported it long for the cultural force-feeding and comfortable 
life of the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become common for Soviet-era literati to lament that Russian high 
culture is dying. Filmmaker Stanislav Govorukhin's complaint is typical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia reads nothing any longer. . . ," he groused recently. "Right before 
our eyes, it is turning into a spiritless and intensely immoral country. Where 
can the people and the nation find their spiritual strength if not from 
culture, literature, theater and art? From where?" 
</P>
<P>
 Poet Andrei Dementyev complained in the daily Moscow Times that poetry 
readings once packed sports stadiums, theaters overflowed and literary journals 
sold millions of copies. But now, he wrote, "Our life is full of pornography, 
worries about the future . . . conversations about the fantastic prices and 
meager salaries." 
</P>
<P>
 These ominous assessments, however, draw little sympathy from St. Petersburg's 
leading cultural lights. They feel no trace of nostalgia for communism's 
70-year ideological stranglehold on culture. 
</P>
<P>
 As literary historian Alexander Panchenko put it: "Soviet power tried to make 
everyone go to the ballet, and it didn't work. Now we're seeing that it didn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet power did far worse than that. 
</P>
<P>
 In its early days, it not only muzzled many of the best Russian talents, it 
killed them in camps or prisons or Siberian exile -- as in the cases of poet 
Osip Mandelstam and theater director Vsevolod Meyerhold. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, it drove many into foreign exile, among them writers Alexander I. 
Solzhenitsyn, and Joseph Brodsky, cellist-conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, 
dancers Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov and sculptor Ernst Neizvestny. 
</P>
<P>
 "The human or the social or the biological race that produced great writers 
was stamped out of existence in all the period of purges and atrocities," said 
Nikita Tolstoy, a physicist and arts enthusiast whose father, Alexei Tolstoy, 
was a distant relative of the great Leo Tolstoy and one of Russia's best-loved 
writers; Nikita's daughter, Tatyana Tolstaya, is now becoming just as popular 
an author. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tolstoys are a happy exception. More typically, artists and musicians 
bemoan the loss of whole generations of the cream of Russian culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuri Temirkanov, head of St. Petersburg's main orchestra, said that for the 
last 20 years he has watched his best musicians and instructors leave, whether 
for greater artistic freedom or simply for softer living. 
</P>
<P>
 "An orchestra is like a living organism," he said. "It needs to be in touch 
with its progenitors. . . . Youth has to study with somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 The visual arts, too, face a generation gap. Artist Sergei Kovalsky, director 
of an entire building of creative squatters -- from performance artists to jazz 
groups -- at 10 Pushkin St. in St. Petersburg, noted that there is no Russian 
museum of contemporary art. There is nowhere for young artists to see how 
Russian artists who spurned the government-imposed style of socialist realism 
-- lots of tractors and happy proletarians -- used to paint in the underground, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't know (pioneering Abstract artists Kasimir) Malevich or (Wassily) 
Kandinsky if they hadn't left in time," Kovalsky said. "This gap between the 
generations is the worst -- it brings a lot of harm to culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet regime left a more subtly damaging legacy as well. In its 
repressiveness, it made underground heroes of those willing to defy it. And 
that, ironically, is creating problems for the heroes themselves, who tend to 
feel lost without anything to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Boris Grebenshikov, the revered leader of the veteran St. Petersburg rock 
group Aquarium, recalled that back when rock was persecuted, his late and 
legendary colleague, Viktor Tsoy, once commented about another musician: "He's 
beating his head against the wall. What's he going to do when he finds himself 
standing in a field?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Grebenshikov said, "They have to learn to live without an enemy, and 
that's the hardest task." 
</P>
<P>
 Several artists and writers, when asked to define the general mood these days 
of Russia's creative cadres, used the word " rasteryannost " -- perplexity, 
confusion, with a tinge of losing one's head. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, "when lyrics were banned, you had to write about the future, 
when everything would be possible," said St. Petersburg poet Tatiana Voltskaya. 
"Now, there's nothing to write, nothing to say. It's very tragic. The 
underground has felt it, and even the official poets like (Yevgeny) 
Yevtushenko. Now they look like dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
 In the theater world, top directors compensate for the current paucity of 
powerful new dramas by returning to the classics. The recent theater sensations 
this month were the premiere of a Rimsky-Korsakov opera "The Invisible City of 
Kitezh" in St. Petersburg's Marinsky -- formerly Kirov -- Theater, and the 
innovative staging of Chekhov's "The Sea Gull" in Moscow's Taganka Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But rehashing the classics does little to diminish a sense of disappointment 
that Russians sense from many Westerners who, impressed by the talent that has 
emigrated, have been waiting for great things from Russia since the Iron 
Curtain was lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Avant-garde composer Sergei Kuryokhin says he has been confronted at European 
festivals by disappointed music hounds with a now-familiar tune: "The borders 
have been open for a few years now. Where's the greatness? We want something 
fresh and bright and something new to the West. Where is it? Why isn't it 
happening?" 
</P>
<P>
 Part of why it is not happening, critics and artists say, is the horrendous 
financial plight of most of Russian culture. The Russian government continues 
to pay subsidies, but the amounts are a mere fraction of what the Soviet system 
used to give those it favored. Nor, in a market economy, can the arts keep pace 
with inflation and its impact on consumers of culture.  
</P>
<P>
 Kovalsky used to have to worry about secret police raids and harassment; now, 
he said, "The hard part is different -- it's survival in the market, because 
there is no art market in Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Temirkanov said his orchestra, in order to pay its musicians decent salaries, 
must spend as much time as possible on tour abroad, generally playing endless 
quantities of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff.  
</P>
<P>
 "We play the same thing year to year, which is of course very bad for the 
orchestra," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the St. Petersburg Conservatory, Russia's oldest music academy, 
administrators say they have barely enough money to pay the gas bill, and local 
newspapers have warned that the building is in such poor repair that it could 
come crashing down on the heads of practicing students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian Culture Fund, the leading foundation meant to foster hundreds of 
cultural programs across the country, used to enjoy the support of Raisa 
Gorbachev. Now it has less than $100,000 in its coffers, according to its head, 
movie director Nikita Mikhalkov. It is not helped by Russia's confused tax 
code, which does little to encourage contributions to charity and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is absolutely monstrous," Mikhalkov said in Moscow. "It's 
monstrous because culture is seen as an appendage that will return by itself 
when the people are fed and clothed and shoed. . . . (But) culture is the 
mother of the people, and if we lose it and the people are left orphaned, we 
will not be forgiven." 
</P>
<P>
 If freedom has condemned St. Petersburg's Philharmonic to endless Tchaikovsky, 
it has brought a new kind of silence to "Leningrad," the literary journal that 
dictator Josef Stalin banned in 1946 after Communist officials decided they did 
not approve of such 20th-Century literary greats as poet Anna Akhmatova and 
satirist Mikhail Zoshchenko. 
</P>
<P>
 Renamed "St. Petersburg," the journal has put out one hefty edition that 
included an absorbing surreal short story, memoirs, poetry and essays. But that 
will probably be it, Editor in Chief Nikolai Kreshchuk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Government support for the journal is gone, and the patron company that helped 
to pay for the first edition has decided to invest in endeavors that could 
bring more return, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of "St. Petersburg" is typical of much of the publishing industry, 
which is hard-put to print serious literature in the face of high paper costs 
and the public hunger for formerly unobtainable romances, science fiction and 
thrillers.  
</P>
<P>
 Complaints about the death of Russian culture come most loudly from among the 
thousands of "official writers" who lost the soft life of hefty royalties, 
prestige, cheap vacations and special shops that membership in the Soviet 
Writers' Union used to bring.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were all these pseudo-writer, pseudo-artists who all served the regime, 
and now they're the ones who are crying that culture has died," Moscow literary 
critic Benedict Sarnov said. In his view, it is Soviet -- not Russian -- 
culture that is dying, and good riddance. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, slowly but surely, the Russian reader is getting acquainted with 
all the thinkers and authors long forbidden to them, from Freud to Russian 
philosopher Nikolai Berdiayev.  
</P>
<P>
 "It looks ugly, but it's a healthy process," Sarnov said of the publishing 
crisis. "In culture, freedom is a higher value than finances." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Kreshchuk of "St. Petersburg" is philosophical rather than bitter. 
Real literature "shouldn't count on the public. Writers are naturally like 
marathoners without an audience."  
</P>
<P>
 The works of the 1960s that caused a sensation by daring to hint at problems 
in the Workers' Paradise may have faded, but a new generation of Russian 
writers is rising, Kreshchuk believes, authors of about 30 who are so truly 
free that freedom is not an issue for them. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, he said, Soviet-Russian literature was carried away by themes 
centered on the hypocritical lives of the Communist elite or the 
Solzhenitsyn-style horrors of life in prison or in a military construction 
battalion. The new generation, he said, will be different. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might have maybe some religious problems and life experience in some 
little village and also have real high culture -- and with that, a new 
literature is being formed," he said. "That's a normal mix, a rich mix, that 
was impossible before." 
</P>
<P>
 Panchenko, the literary historian, sees a new emphasis on style as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Russian writing, he said, might look like this: "A young man meets a 
girl, he falls in love with her, she falls in love with him, they get married 
and have a lot of kids and die -- but all just very well executed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian music world already appears to be living up to their predictions 
in its own way. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest club band in Russia these days appears to be Dva Samaliota -- 
meaning Two Airplanes -- an African-sounding group guaranteed to get audiences 
on their feet. It has gone to the opposite extreme from the underground 
poet-bards of the Soviet era -- eschewing words altogether and singing in a 
gibberish that its vocalist used to claim was Swahili. 
</P>
<P>
 Grebenshikov, the revered rock artist whose spiritual, subtle lyrics are 
considered by many to be the best poetry around today, said of Dva Samaliota: 
"Unfortunately, they absolutely don't have any substance. They're some kind of 
a big joke." 
</P>
<P>
 The joke, however, is full of released energy -- a happy energy almost never 
found in Russia in the old days.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like this fresh stream," said the group's manager, Arkady Volk. "The 
'Planes send their energy into the hall and create a holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 Kovalsky's colony of squatter artists at 10 Pushkinskaya is also a testament 
to the energy of young Russian artists. Known as "the epicenter of the 
avant-garde," its walls are covered with poetic graffiti and it serves as 
frequent host to '60s-style happenings, art shows and concerts. St. Petersburg 
authorities are trying to kick the squatters out, but they show impressive 
determination to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 And for all his worries about the fate of Russia's libraries, museums and 
theaters, Dmitri Likhachev too says he lives in anticipation of the next wave 
of Russian creation -- perhaps something to rival the literary boom of the late 
19th Century or the Silver Age of poets and artists in the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
 It will come, he thinks, from the Russian provinces, and from some of the 
young people who, instead of turning to vandalism, spend their time putting 
together collections of poetry.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have great hope for when they grow up," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He has much to be proud of now, also, he said -- from the solidly good writing 
of Fazil Iskander, a warmly humorous novelist who some think deserves the Nobel 
Prize, to Alfred Schnittke, considered Russia's leading contemporary composer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, Likhachev and others appear to pin their hopes on the mystery of 
the Russian character, which, no matter what changes it undergoes, appears 
simply to need culture and art more deeply than its Western counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 In America, "Culture is what adds beauty to life," composer Kuryokhin said. 
"But for us in Russia, it's what gives life its point."

HAITI'S EXILED LEADER TO TURN UP HEAT ON U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, concluding that the Clinton 
Administration is backing away from his bid to regain power, plans a series of 
steps to pressure Washington into taking stronger action against the military 
rulers of the impoverished Caribbean nation, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The ousted president may soon call on his supporters in Haiti to set sail for 
the U.S. mainland in a flotilla of small boats, to embarrass the Administration 
and challenge its refugee policy, say the sources, who are close to Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say that Aristide may call on African American leaders to exert more 
public and private pressure on President Clinton. And as a third step, Aristide 
may urge France or Canada to take over the U.S. leadership role in trying to 
force the Haitian military to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's camp concedes that the strategy is born of desperation. But after 
allowing the Administration to set the agenda for the past year, Aristide has 
concluded that his best chance for regaining power may lie in making such a 
nuisance of himself that the United States will throw its full weight behind 
his bid to return to Port-au-Prince -- if only to get him out of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 There can be no doubt that the Administration already is weary of Aristide, a 
populist Roman Catholic priest who in December, 1990, won an overwhelming 
victory in Haiti's only democratic presidential election. He was deposed by the 
military in a bloody coup less than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry complained that Aristide was unwilling 
to explore compromises that could permit him to regain at least some of his 
lost power. Asked whether he was accusing Aristide of intransigence, McCurry 
said: "That's close to our reading, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration wants Aristide to endorse a plan put forward by eight 
members of Haiti's Parliament. It calls on the exiled president to name a new 
prime minister, who would form a coalition government. Once the new government 
was established, Aristide would return to Haiti and reclaim the presidency -- 
although he would have to share power with the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide flatly rejected the plan, maintaining that it does not guarantee he 
would ever regain his lost office. A similar proposal last fall failed when Lt. 
Gen. Raoul Cedras, the army commander, and other military leaders refused to 
keep their promise to step down and the U.S. government did not try to enforce 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's supporters say trying the same approach again would be pointless, 
especially without any sort of commitment from the United States to pressure 
the military into keeping its side of the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide and the Haitian Parliament members met for four hours Thursday. 
Afterward, Aristide said his position was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's supporters also fear that if a prime minister is named before 
Aristide regains power, the military might compromise with the prime minister 
to create the appearance of democracy while freezing out the deposed president. 
Although Aristide enjoys the fanatical support of the island's impoverished 
majority, he is hated and feared by the military command and by the wealthy 
civilian elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's trump card in his relationship with the United States is the 
refugee issue. 
</P>
<P>
 After Aristide was deposed, Haitians who feared political repression began 
trying to flee to the United States in small boats. Shortly after Clinton took 
office last year, Aristide -- encouraged by the President's support of renewed 
efforts to restore democracy to the island nation -- urged Haiti's poor to 
remain at home. He also tacitly approved the Administration's policy of 
intercepting Haitian boat people on the high seas and sending them back. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, Aristide broke with the Administration and criticized it 
for returning the refugees. Now, the sources say, he is considering going much 
further by urging Haitians to flee the island. Such a step could create a flood 
of refugees that would deeply embarrass the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the Congressional Black Caucus and some other African American 
leaders -- joined by white liberals on Capitol Hill and a group of artists and 
celebrities -- have been urging the Administration to take stronger action to 
restore Aristide. Now, Aristide strategists say, the exiled president is ready 
to urge those groups to be far more forceful. That move could be troublesome 
for Clinton because the groups are potentially important segments of his 
political base. 
</P>
<P>
 As if on cue, 40 members of the House of Representatives, led by Rep. Joseph 
P. Kennedy (D-Mass.), on Friday called on the Administration to urge the U.N. 
Security Council to impose an economic embargo on Haiti to force the military 
to allow Aristide to return. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, France, Canada and Venezuela are circulating a draft of 
such a resolution at the United Nations but have not yet introduced it.

U.S. WARY OF RUSSIA OFFER TO BOSNIA; BALKANS: MOSCOW'S PROPOSAL TO SEND 400 
TROOPS TO SARAJEVO GETS MIXED RESPONSE. SOME SAY THEIR PRESENCE COULD 
COMPLICATE ANY NATO DECISION ON AIR STRIKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With two days left before a deadline for allied air strikes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Clinton Administration gave a mixed response Friday to 
Moscow's proposal to move Russian troops there, publicly welcoming the 
initiative but privately expressing concern about the possible effect on 
efforts to end the siege of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Administration officials publicly sought to put a good face on Russia's 
offer to Bosnian Serbs on Thursday to redeploy 400 peacekeepers to Sarajevo if 
the rebels would comply with NATO's demand that they relocate or surrender 
their heavy weapons around the city or face air bombardments. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid signs that the Serbs were continuing to pull back some artillery Friday, 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry told reporters he was "cautiously, 
cautiously optimistic about the developments. . . . We among other nations have 
been requesting the Russians to assist in whatever way they can do to help the 
Serbs comply with the NATO directive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In private, however, some U.S. officials conceded that they were apprehensive 
about any new Russian military presence, particularly about whether Moscow 
might use its troops to bolster U.N. and Western goals in Bosnia or would seek 
to protect Serb interests. The presence of troops from Russia -- the Serbs' 
historic patron -- near Bosnian Serb artillery sites could complicate any North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization decision on the bombing of those targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow's move, which caught the Administration by surprise, raised the 
possibility that Russia could become an unpredictable major player in an 
already tangled and many-sided Bosnian conflict. The United States and other 
allied nations scrambled on diplomatic fronts Friday to determine Moscow's 
objectives and plans, but answers remained murky. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect the Russians will be under U.N operational control," a senior 
Administration official said. But the official stopped short of saying that the 
Russians had committed to follow the lead of the U.N. commander, and signals on 
this point from Moscow were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian peacekeepers could reach Sarajevo within two days, once the United 
Nations grants a request from Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin to transfer 
them there from their current base in Croatia, reported the Itar-Tass news 
agency, which said Yeltsin had made such a request. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, U.S. officials contended that the surprise move by Moscow 
was helping the allied cause by sending a clear signal to the Bosnian Serbs 
that they would have to withdraw or turn over control of their artillery 
outside Sarajevo by the deadline of 1 a.m. local time Monday (4 p.m. PST 
Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
 "We will try to withdraw all of our weapons by 2400 tomorrow (midnight 
today)," Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said after meeting with the 
United Nations' top official for the former Yugoslav federation, Yasushi 
Akashi. That would beat by a day the NATO deadline for the heavy guns to be 
withdrawn or put under U.N. supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also stressed that the Russians, like the Americans, have the most 
to gain from a peaceful settlement of the crisis in the Bosnian capital because 
it would allow the two nations to avoid being drawn into positions that would 
drive a wedge into their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton is to make a televised address to the nation shortly after 7 
a.m. PST today to explain the reasons for the threatened air strikes and to 
describe how far the Bosnian Serbs have gone in removing their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian withdrawal began in earnest on Thursday and continued on Friday, 
although not as rapidly as some planners had wished. Under U.N. rules, the 
Serbs must either pull their artillery back to positions 12 miles outside 
Sarajevo or place it under U.N. control. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, in an apparent effort to spur further action from the Bosnian 
Serbs, stressed that NATO intended to follow through on its threats if the 
terms are not fully met. "The decision was a decision and a deadline is a 
deadline," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the Serbs had removed at least 50 
heavy weapons and were continuing to take them out. U.S. officials have 
estimated the Serbs have at least 200, and possibly as many as 500, heavy 
weapons around Sarajevo.  
</P>
<P>
 "It means they have a lot more to take out (before the deadline)," Christopher 
said in a CNN interview. "They will pay a very heavy price if they don't do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is keeping a low public profile on the question of what the 
Russians might do in Bosnia, to avoid pushing Moscow into a corner politically 
for fear that nationalist pressures at home could propel them to support the 
Serbs more aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, said a new Russian presence would "add a complicating factor." But 
he added that because of Russia's influence with the Serbs, "on balance, it's 
positive." Hamilton said Russia's proposal also demonstrated a more aggressive 
foreign policy "that we've already been seeing in other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former U.S. official now with the Brookings Institution, 
predicted that the Russians "are going to want to be sort of lawyers for the 
Serbs." With their role hard to guess now, "it isn't going to be easy to deal 
with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian troops already have been criticized elsewhere in the former Yugoslav 
federation, Sonnenfeldt noted. Some that were supposedly under U.N. control in 
Croatia have been accused of allowing the removal of arms from Croatian 
warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's top national security advisers met for two hours Friday to discuss 
the Bosnian situation and other issues but announced no major new actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry is scheduled to fly to Aviano air base in Italy late today for a 
last-minute meeting with NATO defense ministers to reaffirm the allies' 
intentions. A U.S. official said the group "will leave no doubt that" the 
allies plan to enforce the NATO withdrawal order. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-country organization has hundreds of planes on aircraft carriers and at 
bases in Italy ready to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply with the War Powers Act, Clinton sent Congress a letter Friday 
explaining his actions in Bosnia. The letter noted that NATO's orders not only 
give it authority to strike artillery positions, but also the flexibility to 
hit Serbian air defenses threatening NATO aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also points out that "it is not now possible to determine the 
length of these operations." 
</P>
<P>
 As U.S. officials were giving credit to Clinton for the progress in Sarajevo, 
the Kremlin's diplomatic point man on Yugoslavia, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaly Churkin, was praising Russia for persuading the Serbs to pull back. 
</P>
<P>
 Churkin, speaking in Moscow, noted with pride that "Russia is now playing a 
central role" in the peacemaking attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, Yeltsin sent letters to Clinton and the leaders of France, 
Britain, Italy and Germany expressing concern that air strikes in Bosnia could 
lead to "unpredictable events" and possibly a broader war. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Italian newspaper La Stampa, the letter spoke of worries "not 
only in Russia but in all the world" that NATO wants "to pursue designs of 
dominance." 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, a spokesman said Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali "is delighted" at the Russian offer to move 400 of its 
peacekeeping troops from Croatia to Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sills, the spokesman, described the offer as a response to a request for 
help made to many governments by Lt. Gen. Michael Rose of Britain, the U.N. 
commander in Sarajevo. 
</P>

Doyle McManus and Stanley Meisler in Washington contributed to this report.

WITH RUSH OVER, QUESTIONS ARISE ON EARTHQUAKE RELIEF; HOUSING: SOME PRAISE 
SWIFT RESPONSE. BUT OFFICIALS WONDER IF IT MEANS SHIFT IN GOALS OF DISASTER 
ASSISTANCE.

 Touring Los Angeles the day after the Northridge quake, U.S. Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development Henry G. Cisneros was moved by the thousands of 
people pouring into outdoor encampments and feared the prospect of a new 
category of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are poor people with no connections," Cisneros said. "We have to help 
them. . . . We'll just keep plugging until we have a way." 
</P>
<P>
 Just 24 hours later, HUD officials said they had a way. The department 
announced an unprecedented package of emergency housing assistance that will 
pay most of the rent for displaced, low-income quake victims for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand has been enormous, and the program has been praised by many as an 
example of President Clinton's strong commitment to the recovery effort. But as 
the hectic rush of early relief efforts gives way to cooler reflection on the 
most expensive disaster relief effort in U.S. history, the housing subsidies 
are posing important questions about the nature, goals and limits of disaster 
relief efforts, according to key legislators, Capitol Hill analysts and housing 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the hastily developed HUD program essential to emergency relief efforts? 
Was the traditional Federal Emergency Management Agency housing assistance 
program incapable of meeting Los Angeles' needs? Why guarantee 18 months of 
rent payments? What will happen to tenants when the voucher subsidies run out? 
Were controls adequate to discourage abuse and duplication and ensure the aid 
went to deserving victims? 
</P>
<P>
 It is too early to know how the Los Angeles housing voucher program will be 
judged, but its relatively generous terms may have helped bring an 
unintentional, ironic shift in disaster assistance policy. Championed by one of 
the highest-ranking Latinos in the Clinton Administration, the housing vouchers 
gave added ammunition to those criticizing public assistance for illegal 
immigrants, Capitol Hill sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It focused a number of senators on that (immigrant) issue," said Sen. Harry 
M. Reid (D-Nev.), who helped draft a precedent-setting amendment to the 
$8.6-billion quake aid bill that denies assistance of more than 90 days to 
undocumented residents. Others argue that the issue would have erupted 
regardless of what relief agencies did because of an anti-immigrant climate in 
California and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD officials say the housing voucher program is needed, has adequate controls 
and strikes the proper balance. "Did we provide immediate relief and a sense 
that government was responsive? Are we offering a program that will help 
low-income people?" said Joseph Shuldiner, HUD's assistant secretary for 
housing. "The answer is yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) applauded Cisneros for initiating 
the voucher program, which had never been used in an emergency. "It was very 
positive, if not courageous . . . knowing he could be subject to criticism," 
she said. But the subsidies warrant close review, said Roybal-Allard, who is a 
member of the House subcommittee that monitors federal housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is our obligation and where does that stop? Do we put people in housing 
that they later can't afford? Is this money going to encourage people to . . . 
be lazy and not work and take advantage of the system? This has to be very 
carefully monitored." 
</P>
<P>
 As with reports of rampant fraud in the free-flowing, post-quake food stamp 
program, and disclosures that FEMA mailed checks to people who had not sought 
assistance, the housing vouchers highlight the conflicting pressures on 
government officials in the wake of a major disaster. If people are not quickly 
rehoused and aid is not swiftly disbursed, officials risk criticism from the 
public, politicians and the media that the needy are going unserved. But 
opening the relief tap too wide can lead to waste, abuse, scandal and 
legislative second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, FEMA's emergency housing grants, given in two-month increments to 
renters and three-month increments to homeowners, are supposed to meet the 
needs of disaster victims. The grants, typically $1,100 per month for 
Northridge earthquake victims, are given without regard to income, although 
inspectors are supposed to confirm the applicant's residence was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA's grant can be extended up to 18 months if a continuing need for 
assistance is demonstrated. FEMA grants are paid to victims, who may spend them 
as they wish on replacement housing or to repair a damaged residence. 
</P>
<P>
 The new vouchers, which are intended exclusively for low-income households, 
were needed, HUD officials said, so poor quake victims could compete for 
suitable replacement units. They note that affordable apartments are scarce in 
Los Angeles, and the supply of older, multiunit apartments was diminished by 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD has budgeted $200 million for the vouchers, which guarantee a landlord 
rent for 18 months. The tenants pay 30% of their income to the landlord and the 
government pays the remaining rent, which can total 90% or more of the monthly 
payment. In many cases, that has allowed quake victims to move into apartments 
they could not have afforded before the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The longer term of the voucher and the direct government payments to landlords 
make low-income apartment hunters more appealing to building owners, housing 
officials say. "No one is going to rent to them" if they only have a guarantee 
of two months' rent, HUD's Shuldiner said. "The reality is that the (FEMA 
grant) would have very little value" to low-income quake victims struggling to 
find housing.  
</P>
<P>
 But some key legislators are not fully convinced. Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los 
Angeles) said it is not clear to him that shorter-term housing assistance, such 
as FEMA's, would not have been more suitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not clear it has been studied through," said Dixon, a member of a special 
House committee, created in the wake of budget battles over the Los Angeles aid 
package, that will review disaster relief programs. "I never envisioned any of 
these programs going beyond the period necessary to find permanent housing or 
move these people back into their original housing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake marked the first time HUD housing vouchers were offered 
immediately in the federal disaster assistance centers. The intent was to 
quickly move poorer applicants directly into longer-term housing. But the 
program has not moved as briskly as officials had initially hoped. It has taken 
many applicants weeks to get an appointment to apply for a voucher, then find a 
suitable unit and complete a process of HUD inspections and rent negotiations 
with landlords. As of late this week, nearly 17,000 tentative vouchers had been 
approved, but less than 2,400 recipients had been given final approval to move 
into new units. 
</P>
<P>
 There also have been concerns about the basis on which the HUD vouchers were 
being distributed, particularly in the beginning. Housing officials have relied 
heavily on computer reports compiled by Los Angeles city building inspectors to 
verify that an applicant's building was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 But building officials note that their inspections were cursory and not 
necessarily reliable for decisions on disbursement of long-term housing grants. 
"These (reports) were not intended for that purpose," said Nick Delli Quadri, a 
spokesman for the Building and Safety Department. "(They) were basically 
intended to develop a statistical analysis of damage . . .things were very 
rough. It was not intended to look at each building point by point and say this 
building is not good and that one is good." 
</P>
<P>
 Housing officials said there was no fast, feasible alternative. "It was the 
best there was," said Gary Squier, general manager of the Los Angeles city 
housing department. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also unclear how many landlords will be willing to accept the vouchers. 
Some have expressed reservations about getting involved in a government 
assistance program, and there have been reports of voucher-holders having 
difficulty finding units. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros convened a meeting with the building owners last week to encourage 
more to accept the vouchers. "Obviously, if we had known what we know today . . 
. we would have done the outreach (to landlords) from the beginning," Shuldiner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, critics warn that the emergency housing vouchers could become a 
costly permanent form of housing assistance in Southern California. "They'll 
come in (in 18 months) and we'll have to renew the damn things," said one GOP 
analyst on the House Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Dade County, Fla., are seeking just such a renewal for HUD 
housing vouchers offered to victims of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Far smaller in 
scope, the Florida vouchers were offered two months after the hurricane. And 
the vouchers, good for two years, went to a different mix of applicants, 
including some who had lived in federally subsidized housing units before the 
hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, with the first batch of vouchers scheduled to expire later this 
year, Dade County officials report that most recipients still can't afford 
adequate housing and are at risk of losing their shelters if the relief program 
is not extended.  
</P>
<P>
 HUD and local housing officials say they hope to minimize such problems here. 
Recipients will be reminded in writing that their subsidies will only last 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe a significant number of the people will not need the program more 
than 18 months," Shuldiner said. "They were making it (on their own) 
beforehand. They do have an ability to get jobs. They will get their act 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say any effort to extend the vouchers would be unfair to tens of 
thousands of needy families in Los Angeles County who have been waiting for 
such federal housing assistance for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Comerio, a UC Berkeley associate professor and expert on disaster housing 
issues, says it is far from clear the 18-month vouchers represented the best 
use of HUD's $200 million. "It doesn't address the underlying supply of 
affordable housing, and it sets people up to delay their real housing choices," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 18 months the world (for low-income renters) isn't going to look a whole 
lot different than it does right now. It's seriously time for the federal 
government to think about a disaster housing policy . . . instead of having a 
kind of knee-jerk reaction in response to each disaster," Comerio said.

 Assemblyman Pat Nolan pleaded guilty in federal district court Friday to 
racketeering and was immediately sentenced to 33 months in prison. His sentence 
begins March 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the onetime GOP Assembly leader was unapologetic and said he had 
only pleaded guilty because he feared a lengthier prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "For six years I have battled (federal prosecutors)," Nolan, of Glendale, said 
outside the courthouse. "I'm worn out, though I think I would have convinced a 
jury of my innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, a one-sentence resignation letter from Nolan was the first 
order of business in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators greeted the resignation with a mixture of sympathy and 
indignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said: "I assume you plead guilty because you are 
guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 But the San Francisco Democrat also expressed concern for his onetime 
political rival: "It's always sad when something happens to one of my members. 
. . . This is obviously the worst of the horrors." 
</P>
<P>
 In pleading guilty, Nolan became the first Republican legislator and the first 
member of the Assembly to be convicted as part of an eight-year federal 
political corruption investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Charles J. Stevens, who signed off on Nolan's plea-bargain 
agreement, said the assemblyman's imprisonment would serve as a warning to 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the incarceration of influential legislators such as Nolan will 
chill to the bones any legislator who would even consider linking votes with 
money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In court before U.S. District Judge Edward J. Garcia, a subdued Nolan declined 
to make a statement, but outside the courthouse, speaking to a throng of 
reporters, he complained about the unpredictability of juries and said that if 
he had been convicted of even one of the six counts included in the grand jury 
indictment against him, he might have faced an 8-year, 4-month prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 "That risk was one I am not willing to take," he said, his voice filled with 
emotion. "But my family is too important to me so I've accepted the 
government's offer, which will limit my time away from them as they grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan, 43, and his wife, Gail, have three children -- all under 6 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now have a great appreciation of what Chief Joseph (the defeated 
19th-Century Nez Perce leader) felt when he said, 'I will fight no more.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker Brown and other legislators acknowledged that the latest guilty plea 
in the federal corruption investigation tarnishes the Legislature's image. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles) put it more bluntly: "It is 
a black eye for the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Nolan's Assembly colleagues said they had taken the former Assembly 
Republican leader at his word when he professed his innocence and vowed to 
fight his case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 All but one of the Republicans in the Assembly had endorsed his bid for 
reelection, according to Assemblyman Paul V. Horcher (R-Diamond Bar), who said 
he was the lone holdout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat Nolan and I had a different view on ethics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan's attorney, Ephraim Margolin, defended his client as an honorable person 
with torn allegiances. 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasized that Nolan had refused to cooperate with authorities in the 
prosecution of other public officials in the government's continuing efforts to 
root out corruption in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 He described Nolan's legal dilemma as a choice of loyalties, between his 
family and his Republican allies. 
</P>
<P>
 "So in the final account, the man who never took one penny for himself in this 
affair, who was perhaps too aggressively loyal to his party, decided to take 
his medicine and get it over with," Margolin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sworn statement filed with the court, Nolan described conducting his 
Assembly office as "a racketeering enterprise" for extorting campaign 
contributions from those who sought his support on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted working in collusion with his former legislative aide, Karin 
Watson, to extort a $10,000 campaign contribution from the Marriott Corp. in 
1988 in return for his vote. At issue was a bill that would have helped a rival 
company, Sunrise Development, build a luxury resort in the city of Indian 
Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the money, Nolan said, he voted against the so-called desert 
wars bill, "which was the position Marriott wanted me to take." 
</P>
<P>
 No charges have been filed against Marriott, which had a competing development 
in nearby Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan also admitted accepting in the same year two $5,000 checks from 
undercover FBI agents, who were posing as Southern businessmen as part of an 
elaborate federal sting operation. The agents were seeking Nolan's support for 
a bill that would help their bogus company, Peachstate Capital, build a shrimp 
processing plant near Sacramento. Nolan said he accepted the checks at a 
meeting in a hotel room across from the Capitol. Watson pleaded guilty to 
extortion in 1989 and was expected to be a crucial witness against Nolan and 
two other defendants in a trial still set to begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Those defendants, Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) and former legislative aide 
Terry E. Frost, say they will continue to fight the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were charged with being part of a conspiracy with Nolan and Watson.  
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who was close to Nolan politically when the two served in the Assembly, 
expressed sympathy for Nolan and his young family, but added: "I don't 
understand all the pressures he was under." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill and Frost had asked to be tried separately from Nolan. Now, in effect, 
their wish has been granted, with Nolan dropped from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to get away from Nolan," said Frost's attorney, Christopher H. 
Wing, who argued that the charges against the Republican legislator would hurt 
the other defendants. "This is good news for us in the long run. If Hill would 
get out of there, then we could try this case (against Frost) on the merits and 
not on the publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost said he was glad for another reason as well. With Nolan as a 
co-defendant, he said, the trial could have run an additional seven weeks and 
cost him an extra $70,000 in attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan was named in six of the eight counts in the grand jury indictment issued 
in April; Hill in two, and Frost in one. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the plea bargain, prosecutors dismissed all other charges 
against Nolan, which originally included conspiracy, extortion and money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said that if he were convicted on all charges, Nolan could have 
faced a sentence of more than eight years. Judge Garcia said that the 
agreed-upon 33-month sentence, on the low end of federal sentencing guidelines, 
nevertheless assured proper punishment and rehabilitation. He also fined Nolan 
$10,000 and gave him three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Stevens said that Nolan will not be required to testify for the 
prosecution against Hill and Frost. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan remains free without bail until reporting to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The guilty plea and resignation close the door on what was once a promising 
political career. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan, a lawyer and USC graduate, was first elected to the Assembly in 1978 -- 
one of a crop of so-called Proposition 13 babies who ran for office while 
supporting that landmark property tax-cutting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Glib and ambitious, Nolan formed a rebellious group of insurgent 
conservatives, who in six years were able to take control of the GOP Assembly 
caucus -- with Nolan named as its leader. Under his leadership, the Republicans 
came within a handful of seats of taking control of the Assembly, only to fall 
back again. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost that title in 1988 after FBI agents raided the Capitol, searching his 
offices and those of three other legislators.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Nolan's staff members began cleaning out their offices. His 
Republican colleagues moved immediately to give his seat on the Assembly Rules 
Committee to a colleague. 
</P>

BACKERS SAY NOLAN'S PLEA IS 'LIKE A DEATH IN THE FAMILY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 When Assemblyman Pat Nolan visited engineering mogul Joseph Jacobs at his 
Pasadena office last year to persuade him of his innocence, he left Jacobs 
believing that the Glendale Republican was merely a target of political 
blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs was so convinced that he wrote checks in 1993 totaling $36,000 to the 
Friends of Nolan defense and campaign fund. In an interview earlier this month, 
Jacobs said: "I've gotten his side of the story and it all hangs together as 
far as I'm concerned. I think he's incorruptible." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs is just one of hundreds of supporters who gave their money and faith to 
Nolan as he prepared to face trial next month on federal political corruption 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In coast-to-coast fund-raisers, Nolan raised $522,734 last year from 
unwavering backers ranging from business executives to homemakers to fellow 
Republican politicians. In his quest, Nolan, 43, managed to enlist the help of 
some big names in the world of conservative GOP politics -- Oliver L. North, Ed 
Rollins, Lyn Nofziger and Robert Novak. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his supporters, like the president of Jacobs Engineering, who could 
not be reached Friday, were visited by the assemblyman. In those face-to-face 
discussions, Nolan explained how he came to accept two $5,000 checks in the 
mid-1980s from an undercover FBI agent who posed as a businessman seeking 
special benefits for a bogus shrimp processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
 But few were prepared for Friday's turn of events, when Nolan, who had 
vigorously asserted his innocence, resigned from office, pleaded guilty to one 
count of racketeering and was sentenced to 33 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 One loyal backer, who spoke to Nolan on Thursday night, said the news hit the 
network of supporters "like a death in the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Nolan's contributors reached Friday said they hold fast to their 
belief that Nolan is innocent, despite his admission in court that he committed 
a crime. They said they view his action as a tough choice made for the benefit 
of his family -- particularly his three young children, the oldest of whom is 
5. Had Nolan not pleaded guilty to the single count, he might have faced more 
than eight years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Even knowing that Nolan had pleaded guilty, Glendale attorney Tom Jeffers, 
another longtime campaign contributor, said he is convinced that "Pat would 
never do anything dishonest, not in the slightest." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale contractor and political contributor John Gregg said: "My enthusiasm 
for Pat has not waned one bit. Now I have an even greater level of sympathy for 
the man. As a matter of fact, that's what they had for Christ when they nailed 
him to the cross." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Nolan were sharing the news with dismay, said Glendale Mayor 
Larry Zarian, who is being mentioned as a possible GOP candidate to fill the 
43rd Assembly District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Pat as a hard-working, giving individual. I'm surprised and I'm 
saddened," Zarian said. "To me it's a shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a California Democratic Party official said Nolan's resignation 
opens up possibilities in a longtime Republican district that has seen an 
increase in the number of traditionally Democratic Latino, African American and 
Asian American registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two credible, good candidates who are running," said Joel Maliniak, 
Democratic Party spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
 Democrats Adam Schiff, a former U.S. attorney, and Ken Kulpa, a community 
activist, are planning to square off in the primary. Three Republicans had also 
filed declarations to run against Nolan -- Taryn McNatt-Lorimer of North 
Hollywood, Matthew Collins of Burbank and Peter Repovich of North Hollywood, a 
Los Angeles police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan's resignation automatically reopens the filing period for the June 
primary for five days. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has 14 days to call a special election to fill the remainder of 
Nolan's term. The special election must be held within 120 days of Wilson's 
proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan never denied to his supporters that he took the FBI's checks, backers 
said. His argument was that he treated the transaction as he did any other 
campaign contribution -- by refusing to let it color his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "They accused him of taking a bribe in exchange for voting for creation of an 
enterprise zone, but since he's been in office he's always supported enterprise 
zones to create jobs," Jeffers said. "He's truly a straight arrow through and 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan's decision Friday "came as a complete surprise to me," Jeffers said, 
"but I know he did it because the cost of defending himself was so high and 
because the courts are so unpredictable." In the last half of 1993, campaign 
records show, Nolan had $200,000 in legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, Nolan's contributors say one thing in particular endeared him to 
them -- his level of commitment to conservative politics, mostly in the area of 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is rare to find the unique character of somebody who understands how a 
free-market economy works and has the guts to fight for it," Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Nolan's decision to plead guilty, Gregg said: "I'm extremely despondent at 
what he's done. I wish he would have gone for the 1 in 10 chance that he would 
be found not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Pat would have gone for broke if he didn't have such a great 
commitment for his wife and children. It's too bad he's not still the bachelor 
he was when he first got into politics 15 years ago."

HEALTH ALLIANCE DETRACTORS GAINING THE UPPER HAND; INSURANCE: THEIR FEARS OF 
HUGE BUREAUCRACIES FIND GROWING SUPPORT. CLINTON PLAN'S FATE MAY HANG IN 
BALANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 To President Clinton, the gigantic purchasing alliances that constitute a 
central pillar of his proposed health reform plan would give consumers wider 
choices of health care plans and greater bargaining power versus hospitals and 
doctors -- plus a welcome guarantee that health insurers could not reject them. 
</P>
<P>
 To critics, the alliances are simply mammoth bureaucracies that would strangle 
competition, deny individual businesses the right to tailor health benefits to 
their own workers' needs and force individuals to give up their family doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Which of these visions comes closer to the probable reality? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Clinton, his critics are making considerable headway in 
convincing Congress of the negative view. And if their efforts ultimately 
succeed, it will be bad news for the President: Without health purchasing 
alliances, his entire plan could come tumbling down. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is counting on the alliances to hold down runaway medical costs. And 
if costs cannot be contained, his reform plan could quickly turn into another 
ruinously expensive government entitlement program run by an entrenched federal 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are looking at the beginning of a monstrous and potentially powerful 
agency . . . a massive bureaucracy erected to hide a government program," said 
Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.). "It's not at all clear who they will answer to, 
and I fear they will be accountable to no one." 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, the alliances offend some of the most powerful special 
interests in the health care debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies fear the alliances would squeeze them out of most of their 
medical business. Big corporations argue that, having only recently gained a 
modicum of control of their employees' health costs, they would lose that 
control to the alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress passes the President's proposal, "we're out of the benefits 
business -- we lose complete control of the system and it's all up to the 
government," said Dan Spiller, manager of benefit plans for the Mead Corp. 
"That's completely unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 These mysterious alliances, in simplest terms, are not quite so exotic as they 
may seem. The basic principle they rest on is one that big businesses, chain 
stores and discount merchandisers have followed for decades: centralize your 
purchasing to take advantage of economies of scale. 
</P>
<P>
 A supermarket chain that orders potatoes by the ton and cornflakes by the 
boxcar can negotiate better prices than the old mom-and-pop groceries that buy 
by the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a health care alliance representing several thousand consumers can 
theoretically drive a sharper bargain with networks of health care providers 
than individual patients could. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, large companies that provide health care benefits for their employees 
are already operating just like Clinton's proposed alliances. They now approach 
hospitals, groups of doctors and other providers and say, in effect, "We will 
deliver large numbers of patients -- and thus profits -- if you will cut us a 
deal on the price." The resulting agreements have brought changes and savings 
to employer-supplied health care programs in almost every corner of American 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 On a smaller scale, farmers in many parts of the country have long joined 
together in cooperatives to buy seed and fertilizer and other commodities at 
lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, families in cities sometimes form food-buying cooperatives to get 
better quality and better prices on such things as fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton's plan became law, almost all Americans would belong to the health 
alliance serving their state or region. The major exceptions would be those who 
were covered by Medicare and, in some cases, those who worked for companies 
with more than 5,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Each alliance would act as the sole health care purchasing agent for almost 
everyone in its region. It would negotiate with health maintenance 
organizations and insurance companies for the best deals for its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from that, their very size would allow the alliances to spread the costs 
of particularly expensive medical treatments over large groups, thus limiting 
insurers' exposure when they have to cover the elderly and the ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alliances are designed to end discrimination in the marketplace," White 
House senior health adviser Ira Magaziner said. "It is not right that because 
of your age or health status you pay more. If you want to achieve an end to 
discrimination, you need a large pool." 
</P>
<P>
 State governments would decide on the alliances' geographical boundaries and 
select their boards of directors, which would have to be equally divided 
between consumers and business representatives. No one working in the health 
industry -- doctors, nurses, hospital employees or insurance company employees 
-- could serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year a newly created federal agency called the National Health Board 
would set a target for total health care spending in the nation and give each 
regional alliance a corresponding budget target. The alliance would use its 
authority over fees and charges to keep spending at the required level. 
</P>
<P>
 A market such as Los Angeles would have one alliance, but the alliance could 
approve 10 or more health plans, probably including such well-known names as 
Kaiser Permanente, Blue Cross, Aetna and Prudential, for its individual members 
to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 All these vendors would be required to offer a standard, comprehensive set of 
benefits more generous than currently offered by most employers. Plans could 
offer extra benefits, such as prescription eyeglasses and cosmetic surgery, for 
extra charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a year, consumers could choose among the approved health plans. They 
could still go outside the doctors and hospitals that participate in their 
plans, but they would have to pay out of their own pockets for the medical care 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the theory. Proponents say it would achieve its goals with little or 
no pain to consumers or to providers -- if they are reasonable in their charges 
and efficient in their operations. Certainly the alliances would be far less 
bureaucratic than the paper shufflers who operate today's health care system, 
says Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.). 
</P>
<P>
 Critics reject that view and argue that the reality of the alliances would 
turn out to be anything but benign. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the impartial Congressional Budget Office, in its analysis of the Clinton 
plan, warned that the inexperienced alliances could be overwhelmed by their 
enormous job. 
</P>
<P>
 And not surprisingly, many segments of the existing health care industry worry 
about what the alliances would mean for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost are health insurance companies. The big ones, such as Aetna and 
Prudential, would probably assume the job of stitching doctors and hospitals 
into the provider networks that the alliances would offer to their members. 
</P>
<P>
 But they resist the degree of government supervision that the Clinton plan 
entails. And the small insurers worry that they would have no role at all. 
</P>
<P>
 In a television commercial sponsored by the Health Insurance Assn. of America, 
a young, concerned couple worries that "thousands of government bureaucrats" 
would dictate their health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses are no happier with the prospect that the alliances would wrest 
from them the control they now exercise over their own benefits programs. They 
don't trust the President enough to surrender that power to him, even in return 
for his promise to hold down health costs nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton launched his crusade for health reform, he counted on big 
business -- beset as it was by rising medical care costs -- to rally around his 
plan. After months of intense flirting, entreating and cajoling, however, the 
White House still has failed to enlist any significant business backing for 
health alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract big business support, the President's plan would allow companies 
with 5,000 or more workers to stay outside the regional alliances and create 
their own "corporate alliances." 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said recently that the 5,000 threshold could 
be lowered. 
</P>
<P>
 Business was not impressed. It argues that the gigantic regional alliances 
would so dominate the purchasing of health care that even the biggest 
companies, unable to compete, would have no choice but to join them. And it 
strongly objects to the 1% payroll tax that business would have to pay for the 
privilege of maintaining corporate alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not one of my Fortune 500 big-company members has expressed any enthusiasm 
for the corporate alliances," said James Klein, executive director of the Assn. 
of Private Pension and Welfare Plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Many executives refuse to believe the White House claim that corporations 
under the Clinton plan would spend no more than 7.9% of their payroll to buy 
insurance packages that include comprehensive coverage for doctor and hospital 
bills plus payments for prescription drugs and home care for the chronically 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Batey, benefits manager at Ameritech, which provides telephone service in 
the Midwest, said: "We're afraid the 7.9% is just a starting point. I don't 
think it's fixed in granite; it will keep moving." 
</P>
<P>
 The Business Roundtable, a collection of the chief executives of 200 of 
America's biggest companies, scorned Clinton's overtures and embarrassed him by 
embracing the rival plan of Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's plan would also create health alliances but make them strictly 
voluntary and allow for competing alliances in a single region. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much support for specifics of the Cooper bill," explained Sun Oil 
benefits manager Mitchell Anderman, "but rather that it moves us away from the 
Clinton plan."

JANSEN STREAKS TO GOLD, LEAVES FAILURES BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six years to the week after his sister Jane died of leukemia, thrusting him 
into the center of one of the most enduring Olympic dramas, speedskater Dan 
Jansen took a victory lap Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 With a gold medal draped around his neck and a spotlight focused on him in the 
otherwise darkened Olympic Hall, Jansen waved to a cheering crowd of 12,000 
while carrying his daughter in the other arm. She was born last May, and her 
name is Jane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our saga started back in Calgary when Dan lost his sister, Jane," said 
Jansen's wife, Robin. "The saga ended today, and we wanted it to end with the 
new Jane in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 It ended with an exclamation point. Not only did Jansen, 28, of Greenfield, 
Wis., win the 1,000 meters in the Winter Olympics, he set a world record, 1 
minute 12.43 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 The favorite, Belarus' Igor Zhelezovsky, was almost three-tenths of a second 
slower in 1:12.72 and finished second. Russia's Sergei Klevchenya was third in 
1:12.85. 
</P>
<P>
 Half an hour after the medal ceremony, Jansen's post-race news conference was 
interrupted by a telephone call from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the whole country is proud, and he said he understood a little bit 
what I've been through because his campaigns have been up and down," Jansen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes later, Hillary Rodham Clinton called to offer congratulations 
from an airplane over South Dakota. She and daughter Chelsea were inside the 
Olympic Hall last Monday to witness the most recent of Jansen's Olympic 
disappointments in the 500 meters, a race he had been expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Speedskaters Eric Heiden and Bonnie Blair became widely known in the United 
States when they won Olympic gold, while others usually toil in obscurity. 
Jansen's high profile was a result not of his many accomplishments in the sport 
but of his failures. 
</P>
<P>
 They began under the most unnerving circumstances. Five hours before he was 
scheduled to compete in the 500 meters in the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary, 
Canada, he learned that his sister, Jane Beres, had died after a lengthy battle 
with leukemia.  
</P>
<P>
 He skated that afternoon because, he said, his sister would have wanted him 
to, but unable to concentrate, he fell only 10 seconds into the race. Four days 
later, on the afternoon he would fly to Wisconsin for his sister's funeral, he 
competed in the 1,000 and fell again. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four years before the next Winter Games, at Albertville, France, Jansen 
established himself as the favorite in the 500 meters and a medal contender in 
the 1,000. But constantly reminded in interviews of his sister's death, he 
admitted later that he was unable to focus on his races. 
</P>
<P>
 He inexplicably hesitated while entering the final curve in the 500 meters and 
finished fourth. His confidence eroded, he was 26th in the 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting advice from his coach and a sports psychologist, Jansen adopted a 
new approach in the months leading to the competition here, deflecting 
questions from reporters about previous Olympic experiences by saying that he 
was focusing only on the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the moment he had Monday in the 500 meters was so reminiscent of others he 
has had in the Olympics that he could not avoid addressing the past. Searching 
for an explanation after he had slipped twice in the last curve and finished 
eighth, he said, "Maybe it's not meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
 He vowed, however, that he would not quit, and when he arrived Friday at the 
Olympic Hall, a state-of-the-art arena designed to resemble an upside-down 
Viking ship, he discovered that the crowd had not quit on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only were the few Americans here cheering him, so were speedskating fans 
from other countries where Jansen has become a heroic yet sympathetic figure. 
The Norwegians waved flags and clanged cowbells for him as if he were one of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jansen crossed the finish line in a time that was unlikely to be beaten 
by remaining competitors, the commentator for Norwegian television screamed, 
"Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen covered his eyes with his hands and began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 So did his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday's race, Robin Jansen, a devout Catholic, admitted that her faith 
had been tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I saw him slip, I said, 'Why, God? Why again?' " she said then. 
"God can't be that cruel." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, she said her husband's perseverance had been rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew when I saw the time that it was going to be first place," she said. "I 
was elated. My hands went to the heavens, and I said: 'Thank you! Thank you! 
Thank you! He finally got what he deserved.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I didn't feel real good. I almost fainted." 
</P>
<P>
 She was taken to the arena's medical center but released after she calmed down 
several minutes later, in plenty of time to see her husband in the emotional 
medal ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears welling in his eyes after he had received the gold medal from Anita 
DeFrantz of Los Angeles, a member of the International Olympic Committee, 
Jansen quietly sang the words to "The Star Spangled Banner." When the music 
stopped, he looked up and gently saluted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was to my sister, Jane," he said later. "When I go through hard times, I 
think about her quite a bit. It's not a sad feeling anymore. That's gone. It's 
just a feeling that she's still with me."

ECONOMICS; UNEMPLOYMENT RAVAGES NATIONS ON GLOBAL SCALE; U.N. REPORT SHOWS 
JOBLESS RATES AT THEIR HIGHEST IN DECADES. BUT ASIAN ECONOMIES DEFY THE BLEAK 
ASSESSMENT. 
</P>

 Whether rich or poor, almost every government on Earth reigns over an economy 
that fails at supplying enough jobs to reduce the dispiriting and growing 
numbers of men and women without work. The only exceptions are the newly flush 
lands of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people are out of work than ever before," reports the International 
Labor Organization, a U.N. agency, "and there is widespread anxiety that these 
numbers will grow." 
</P>
<P>
 ILO, surveying the world, reported recently that the industrialized countries 
-- Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan -- have 
unemployment rates "at their highest levels since the Great Depression" of the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of 1994, the agency predicted, 35 million people will be out of 
work in these industrialized countries, an unemployment rate of 8.6%. To make 
matters worse, an increasing number of the unemployed are finding no work for 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, Belgium and Ireland, more than 60% of the unemployed are such 
long-termers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people are out of work for more than a year," the ILO report says, "they 
lose skills and work habits and cease to be attractive to employers." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia and Eastern Europe, transforming themselves from communism to 
capitalism, are suffering massive job losses, the report said. ILO, in fact, 
says it does not believe official figures that show the unemployment rate in 
Russia at less than 1%. The countries of the former Soviet Union probably have 
an unemployment rate of more than 10%, it asserts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst aspect of the economic restructuring is the appalling growth in the 
number of people living in poverty," ILO says, estimating the number of poor in 
the former Soviet Union at 100 million at the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Latin America, while improving, still has unemployment rates worse than in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 ILO says there has been a disturbing increase in the number of what it called 
"precarious" workers -- part-time, poorly paid laborers -- in picking and 
processing coffee, sugar cane, cotton, fruit and vegetables for export. 
</P>
<P>
 Africa is in a woeful state: The number of those without work is ballooning 
and the wages of those with work plummeting. During the 1980s, wages dropped by 
70% in Tanzania and 40% in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 Unprotected by government safety nets, millions of urban Africans survive by 
living off relatives in the bush or working in what academics call "the 
informal economy" -- selling matches, chewing gum and other petty goods on 
street corners, guarding cars for tips and begging. 
</P>
<P>
 ILO suggested three causes for the worldwide malaise: 
</P>
<P>
 * The decline in economic growth rates since the first "oil shock" of 1973, 
especially among the industrialized countries, which account for 75% of the 
world's gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A veritable technological revolution" in such fields as microelectronics, 
computer science, telecommunications and transportation. ILO said this 
revolution makes it easy for companies to operate swiftly in any part of the 
world, thus intensifying worldwide economic competition. To meet this 
competition, large corporations are slimming down, eliminating well-paying 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Failure of government policies: overprotection of the economies in the 
1970s, a swing too far in the opposite direction toward a liberal free market 
in the 1980s and the imposition of tight money policies on debtor Third World 
countries that proved of little benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 The striking exceptions to this barren landscape are Singapore, Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand.  
</P>
<P>
 ILO, though not wildly optimistic, believes that their success may point a way 
out for the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important of what ILO calls "pointers to possible solutions" is that 
these countries welcomed foreign investment and foreign know-how to a free 
market at a time when most other developing countries were trying to protect 
non-competitive domestic industries with a tariff wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic strategy followed by the East and Southeast Asian economies," the 
report says, "was the antithesis of the protectionist and interventionist 
policies followed by many developing countries in the 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
 To make their economies more competitive, the Asian governments invested 
heavily in infrastructure and education. "No less important were policies to 
reduce poverty, since the poor have never been an asset in international 
competition," ILO says. A World of Job Woes 
</P>
<P>
 "More people are out of work than ever before," reports the International 
Labor Organization, a U.N. agency. Among its findings: 
</P>
<P>
 Latin America, while improving, still has unemployment rates worse than in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ireland and Italy, 60% of jobless are long-termers. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of those without work in Africa is ballooning and the wages of 
those with work plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Countries of the former Soviet Union probably have an unemployment rate of 
more than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea and Singapore are among nations where outlook is improving.

PACKWOOD LOSES LEGAL FIGHT TO KEEP DIARIES FROM PANEL; PROBE: APPEALS COURT 
REFUSES TO ALLOW DELAY IN TURNING OVER MATERIALS TO SENATE ETHICS COMMITTEE. 
TRANSFER COULD BEGIN AS EARLY AS TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court refused on Friday to keep Sen. Bob Packwood's diaries 
from the Senate Ethics Committee while he appeals the panel's subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 The order means the Oregon Republican's diaries could begin making their way 
to the committee as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood "has not satisfied the stringent standards required for a stay 
pending appeal," said a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The order left intact a 15-day timetable set by U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson on Feb. 7 to begin transferring the diaries to the committee 
for its investigation of allegations of sexual misconduct, witness intimidation 
and obstruction of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any comment at this time" on the appeals court's order, said 
Packwood's press secretary, Bobbi Munson. His lawyer, Jacob Stein, was in a 
conference and could not be reached for immediate comment, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood's lawyers say the Ethics Committee's subpoena violates the senator's 
right of privacy under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment as well as his Fifth 
Amendment protection against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 In an order initialed by Judges Harry T. Edwards, David B. Sentelle and A. 
Raymond Randolph, the court said it would expedite Packwood's appeal. Argument 
was scheduled for May 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein argued before Jackson that the challenge to the subpoena would be 
meaningless if the diaries, which include audio recordings and transcripts, 
were given to investigators before the appellate court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate lawyers said in court papers this week that Packwood's refusal to 
cooperate with the committee threatened Congress' self-policing powers. They 
said they "never before needed to issue a subpoena to a senator." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethics Committee is investigating allegations that the senator made 
unwanted sexual advances to more than two dozen women, used his staff to 
intimidate witnesses, solicited job offers from lobbyists for his wife and 
obstructed the congressional probe by altering the diaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood initially gave the committee his diaries, but cut off access to 
diaries covering 1989 to the present after the panel found segments that showed 
lobbyists and business executives offered his wife a job during their divorce 
proceedings.

ISRAEL EMBARKS ON NEIGHBORLY MISSION OF HOPE TO SYRIA; MIDEAST: GOVERNMENT 
REACHES OUT TO BEREAVED ASSAD. IT IS HOPED KINDNESS WILL ALSO SPUR PEACE.

 The head of Israel's Democratic Arab Party said Friday that he will lead an 
official delegation of Israeli Arabs to Damascus, marking the first visit to 
Syria of a member of Israel's Parliament, the Knesset. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-member delegation of municipal leaders, writers, religious figures and 
others will pay condolences to Syrian President Hafez Assad on the death of his 
son, but Israeli officials hope the visit may also indicate an important thaw 
in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a positive signal, and I praise this signal, but it has its 
limitations," said Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. "This is not yet an 
outbreak of opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Knesset member Abdul Wahab Darawshe, who will head the delegation on its trip 
during the next few days, said the group was going on a strictly humanitarian 
mission, but he did not rule out possible advances in the peace process between 
Israel and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may project a better atmosphere. I believe, generally speaking, that the 
visit will have a positive impact on peace," said Darawshe, one of seven 
Israeli Arabs in the 120-seat Knesset and a leading spokesman for Israel's 
800,000 Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Arab Knesset member, Talib Sanaa, will also be part of the delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes as peace talks between Israel and Syria reopened this 
week in Washington, strained by the firing on Wednesday of a Russian-made 
Katyusha rocket into northern Israel from southern Lebanon, the first violation 
of a cease-fire that ended a major Israeli military operation last June 
designed to wipe out guerrilla operations on the Israel-Lebanon border. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Syrian forces control the majority of Lebanese territory, Israel 
quickly raised an alarm, and U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley met with Lebanese 
President Elias Hrawi to urge a halt to the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, conferring in Washington with Israeli 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin, telephoned Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk 
Shareh. The situation reportedly was calmed when U.S. officials transmitted to 
Israel a message that Damascus stands behind the cease-fire agreement and had 
been unaware of the Katyusha firing into the western Galilee. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, Israeli officials sought to lower the temperature, saying they 
believe the rocket was fired by a Palestinian fringe group, the Black 13th of 
September Brigades. That organization was founded in southern Lebanon by 
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat's disgruntled former 
military commander after the signing of the Sept. 13 peace agreement between 
Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand this Katyusha came from the side of a marginal and unimportant 
organization," Peres said. "I would not build the entire policy on the (basis) 
of the shooting of one Katyusha." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel's understanding with Syria concerned 
operations of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon, not 
other organizations. "The understandings in the area with the Syrians regarding 
Hezbollah remain in force," he said. "Our understandings were about the 
operations of Hezbollah, and they are being kept." 
</P>
<P>
 Up to seven more Katyusha rockets were fired into Israel's self-declared 
security zone in southern Lebanon on Thursday and Friday, and Israeli defense 
forces hit back with artillery fire. There were no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement that an Israeli Arab delegation would be permitted to visit 
Syria followed complaints by Rabin that an earlier Syrian refusal to admit the 
group represented Syria's failure to take the peace process seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regretfully, even if I believe that Syria wants peace, according to its 
behavior, Syria is not doing what is necessary in order to truthfully 
demonstrate to the Israeli people that it has genuinely turned toward peace," 
Rabin said after Syria initially rejected the delegation's visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnabout came after intervention from Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir 
Moussa and was conveyed this week to the Israeli Arab delegation by Egypt's 
ambassador to Israel, Mohammed Bassiouny. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I know, it is the first time that the Syrian government is allowing an 
Israeli Arab citizen to enter Syria," Darawshe said. He said that while the 
delegation expects to meet with Assad, they do not have any specific political 
agenda to discuss, nor will they be carrying any messages from Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to express our condolences to the president, his family and the 
Syrian people over the death of his son," he said. "There is no connection with 
the peace efforts, but if anything useful should arise from the visit, I would 
welcome it." 
</P>
<P>
 Assad's son Basil was killed in a traffic accident last month.

MASKED REBEL CUTS SWATH THROUGH MEXICO; REVOLT: SOCIETY MATRONS ARE SAID TO 
SWOON OVER THE INDIANS' SPOKESMAN. BUT AN ARMY OFFICER SAYS: 'PEOPLE HIDE THEIR 
FACES TO COMMIT CRIMES.' 
</P>

 Mexicans love a masked hero. 
</P>
<P>
 From Zorro, the nobleman who righted wrongs in colonial California, to 
Superbarrio, the modern-day wrestler looking out for the rights of the city's 
poor, disguise enhances the legend. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's little wonder that a sharp-witted rebel in a ski mask has become a 
celebrity as Sub-commander Marcos, the voice of the revolution in southern 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The society matrons that columnist Guadalupe Loaeza satirizes in the newspaper 
Reforma are all in love with the mysterious guerrilla, she claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am attracted to him because he is unknown, unreachable," Loaeza recently 
quoted one friend as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Another keeps a poster of him in her closet, where her husband cannot see it, 
the columnist wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The urbane, and admittedly urban, Marcos has created a bridge of sympathy 
between Indian guerrillas and university students, shop clerks and taxi drivers 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "His is a struggle born of the problems in Chiapas," said Juventino, a 
44-year-old Mexico City environmental consultant, who would not reveal his last 
name. "The people have no liberty in their own country. I believe he is doing 
what the people want him to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Other rebels also wear ski masks, which are as much a part of their uniform as 
red bandannas and fatigue pants. Nevertheless, it is Marcos who has made the 
mask his trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos emerged as the most quotable rebel during the New Year's Day guerrilla 
occupation of this colonial town and four other county seats in Chiapas, 
Mexico's most southern state. Mexican reporters who visited him at city hall 
came away with observations of his such as, "Now we will see whether those 
(expletives) keep on saying there are no guerrillas in Mexico."  
</P>
<P>
 Since the Zapatista National Liberation Army, as the revolutionaries call 
themselves, retreated to the jungle, Marcos is the name that has been signed on 
messages to the government and the news media. His communiques intertwine 
lampoons of Televisa, the unpopular television semi-monopoly, and intellectuals 
close to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari with graphic descriptions of the 
desperate poverty in rural Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels do not want Televisa present at the pending peace talks with the 
government, he said, "because they do not need to look for news; they just make 
it up." 
</P>
<P>
 His reaction to the government offer of amnesty: "What are they going to 
pardon us for? For not dying of hunger? For not keeping quiet in our misery? 
For not having humbly accepted the weighty historic burden of scorn and 
abandonment?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he will refer to the military strategy of Mexican Revolution hero 
Francisco Villa or that of Spanish conqueror Hernan Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos has revealed that he is a city boy who set out for the jungle, 
disillusioned, sometime after the 1988 presidential election, which was widely 
reported to have been rife with fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can say: 'You ought to try elections' " as a method for change, he 
told reporters from the independent daily La Jornada who interviewed him in the 
jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos claims to be one of only three non-Indians among the Zapatistas and to 
take orders from an Indian high command, called the Clandestine Indigenous 
Revolutionary Committee. Nearly seven weeks into the rebellion, authorities may 
know less about him now than they thought they did Jan. 2, when he was granting 
interviews in San Cristobal de las Casas. Based on a description of him as 
light-skinned, green-eyed and about 5 feet, 8 inches tall, with a prominent 
nose, the army mistakenly arrested three different men, including a Smithsonian 
Institution biologist. Since then, La Jornada journalists who interviewed 
Marcos have said that he actually has light brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is always the possibility both could be right. After all, three 
different men are known to wear the Superbarrio costume to march in 
demonstrations and wrestle symbols of evil and oppression wherever they are 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 On New Year's Day in San Cristobal, Marcos said, "This masked man may be 
called Marcos here and tomorrow be Pedro in (Las) Margaritas, or Josue in 
Ocosingo or Alfredo in Altamirano," naming other towns then held by rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Marcos claimed then that the ski mask, which has become his 
symbol, was meant to prevent the creation of personality cults among the 
guerrilla leaders, by making them indistinguishable from each other.  
</P>
<P>
 In lighter moods, he has offered other explanations for the mask, from: 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who are the most handsome have to protect ourselves," to: 
</P>
<P>
 "We started wearing them because it was cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone is amused or intrigued by the mask. 
</P>
<P>
 "People hide their faces to commit crimes," said Gen. Miguel Angel Godinez, 
army commander of Mexico's southeastern region, where the rebellion took place. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the public in general, the mask clearly adds to the Marcos mystique. 
As Nobel Literature laureate Octavio Paz wrote in "Labyrinth of Solitude," his 
study of the Mexican character, "The mask is the Mexican's true face." 
</P>
<P>
 If that is true, the growing popularity of Marcos-like ski masks could be an 
additional concern for an already worried government. At recent demonstrations 
in Mexico City, marchers have taken to wearing masks to symbolize their support 
for Marcos and the Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
 And the mystique of the mask seems to have taken over the man. Marcos 
described himself in a recent interview as "Just a ski mask with a prominent 
nose."

CHINA, BRITAIN, BELGIUM ACCEPT NUCLEAR WASTE DUMPING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A ban on nuclear waste dumping at sea moved a step closer to reality Friday 
with news that China, Britain and Belgium would toe the line and accept the 
restrictions in a last-minute change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 All three, along with France and Russia, had abstained when 37 other countries 
agreed in November to ban dumping at sea of low- and intermediate-level 
radioactive waste.Dumping of higher-level waste is already banned. 
</P>
<P>
 France had recently said it would change policy and go along with the ban, and 
the announcements in Britain, China and Belgium on Friday seemed to leave 
Russia in the lurch. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, Agriculture Minister Gillian Shephard said in a statement released 
to Parliament that Britain still believes scientific evidence suggests that a 
ban is unnecessary but that it would bow to international feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brussels, an Environment Ministry official said Belgium had changed its 
mind and would accept the ban. The official New China News Agency said Beijing 
would also fall into line. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban is being established under the terms of the London Convention on 
marine pollution and dumping, and the signatory countries that abstained in the 
November vote had until midnight Sunday to say whether they would toe the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ban is to be reviewed internationally in 25 years, and Britain said it 
would reopen negotiations if the weight of opinion changed in favor of 
radioactive dumping. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not legally binding on dissenting nations who are signatories to the 
London Convention. But they remain bound by its original ruling, approved in 
1972, which prohibits the dumping of higher-level radioactive waste.

 Seven Nobel Peace Prize winners on Friday called on world leaders to meet in 
Sarajevo with the warring sides to try to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition was made public in the Costa Rican capital by former President 
Oscar Arias Sanchez, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts to 
bring peace to Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 A summit in the heart of the former Yugoslav federation "constitutes a 
realistic option to a conflict that threatens to spill over its borders . . . 
and become a danger for peace and security in the entire world," the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also was signed by fellow peace laureates South African Archbishop 
Desmond M. Tutu, 1984; Betty Williams and Mairead Maguire of Northern Ireland, 
co-winners in 1976; Kara Newell, executive director of American Friends Service 
Committee, which won in 1947; Romanian-American writer Elie Wiesel, 1986, and 
Argentine human rights advocate Adolfo Perez Esquivel, 1980.

NEWS ANALYSIS; SARAJEVO ULTIMATUM NOT END OF CLINTON'S POLITICAL QUAGMIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For President Clinton, the apparent decision by the Bosnian Serbs to accept a 
NATO ultimatum and remove their heavy guns from Sarajevo will not resolve a 
long-term political dilemma he has struggled with for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The current hopes for relief of the besieged capital might easily be dashed by 
a last-minute explosion in that volatile land. But even if the Serbs fulfill 
their commitment, Clinton's prominent role in forcing a reluctant Western 
alliance to deliver its ultimatum has raised the profile of American 
involvement in the intractable conflict and made backing away from future 
crises more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 As leader of the world's sole remaining superpower, the President still 
confronts the challenge of using the strife-torn Balkans as a crucible in which 
to fashion a post-Cold War formula for dealing with foreign crises. And he must 
achieve this without plunging the nation into a Vietnam-style quagmire that 
would wreck the activist domestic agenda he is committed to fulfilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens in Sarajevo in the days just ahead, the problem of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will not be over. At its best, the local truce demanded by 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would fall far short of resolving the 
deep-rooted conflicts that have been tearing apart the former Yugoslav 
federation for some two years. And the apparently unilateral decision by Moscow 
to send a contingent of Russian troops into the Sarajevo area only complicates 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 It is equally clear that as long as the threat of violence hangs over Bosnia, 
the demands from European allies and influential cohorts in this country for 
greater U.S. involvement will not cease. In fact, the United States is already 
at least theoretically committed to sending ground forces to the area to help 
maintain a U.N. peacekeeping force, although some analysts say the conditions 
for U.S. participation are so stringent that this may never come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be a huge mistake," Larry DiRita, a Heritage Foundation specialist 
on defense and foreign policy, said of the plan to dispatch about a division of 
U.S. forces to help patrol a partitioned Bosnia. "He (Clinton) sets himself up 
for the Republicans to say in 1996, 'Look, he's got a division bogged down in 
the Balkans.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to play a constructive part in the Bosnian crisis, Clinton must 
contend not only with the murderous religious and ethnic rivalries of the 
Balkans but with the relative indifference of most Americans to the violent 
upheaval abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "In foreign affairs, only two kinds of things matter to most Americans enough 
to be politically significant -- a great success or a great defeat," American 
University presidential scholar Alan J. Lichtman said. As Lichtman sees it, the 
chances of Clinton achieving a great success in Bosnia are slim, "so the best 
he can hope for is to avoid a major defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 How did Clinton get himself into such a pickle? Part of the answer is the new 
complications in international relations -- the penalty the United States and 
the West are paying for prevailing over communism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We no longer have a clear Cold War framework to guide people's thinking," 
says Stanley Greenberg, Clinton's campaign pollster who continues to advise the 
White House on political strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's predecessor, George Bush, also had to cope with this lack of public 
focus in dealing with the first post-Cold War international crisis, in the 
Persian Gulf. But Bush's task was easier because Iraq had committed a clear act 
of aggression by seizing Kuwait and because the Middle East with its oil 
supplies has long been considered vital to U.S. security. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Clinton faces the challenge of finding a convincing justification 
for American involvement in a civil war being waged in a corner of the world 
best known to Americans only as the powder keg that set off World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you could make the case there was a global Communist threat, you could 
justify sending 500,000 men to Vietnam," public-opinion analyst Ben Wattenberg 
said. "But you can't justify sending 500,000 men to Bosnia and take 200 
casualties a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also has himself to blame for his present conundrum, most analysts 
feel, because of his 1992 campaign criticism of Bush for not taking harsher 
measures against the Serbs. Clinton's comments built up expectations for his 
own performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was obsessed by the fact that he was not in service during Vietnam and he 
wanted to look tough," says Ted Van Dyk, a longtime policy adviser to 
Democratic presidential candidates who remembers hiring a young Bill Clinton to 
work as an organizer for George McGovern's 1972 Democratic presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively small but highly influential groups that support an activist U.S. 
role in the world in general and Bosnia in particular have not let the 
President forget his tough rhetoric. Their voices are raised in both parties 
and across the philosophical spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that we have both profound humanitarian and strategic concerns in 
Bosnia," Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, who was President Ronald Reagan's ambassador to 
the United Nations, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a function of presidential leadership to do what needs to be done and 
explain that to the people, and people will respond positively." 
</P>
<P>
 From another corner of the ideological street, Andrew Sullivan, editor of the 
relatively liberal and normally Democratic magazine New Republic, denounced 
Clinton's "dilatory, casuistic response to the Great Crime in the Balkans." 
Sullivan accused Clinton of "transforming the only superpower in the world into 
the only abdicating superpower in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the merits of their cause, many of those who seek to stir outrage 
over the bloodshed in Bosnia make a strong appeal to the emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Benetton, the Italian clothing company known for its promotion of social 
activism, ran a double-page ad in the Washington Post this week as part of a 
worldwide campaign; it depicted the blood-soaked clothes of a Bosnian soldier 
killed in battle along with a message from the soldier's father urging that his 
son's death be used "in the name of peace and against war." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is finding it hard to hold his own against such arguments, despite the 
"bully pulpit" of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton has tried every which way to avoid risks in foreign policy," says 
Bert Rockman, a University of Pittsburgh presidential scholar. "But he is 
discovering that in situations where the highly attentive opinion makers find 
inaction intolerable, he can't afford not to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Clinton supporters say that to have more impact on the public debate, the 
President needs to do a better job of articulating the U.S. position on Bosnia. 
"By going to the American people and stating what the mission here (in Bosnia) 
is," Clinton "would put Americans at ease . . . make himself less a target of 
Republicans . . . (and) send a message to the Serbs and to the world," Delaware 
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, told reporters this week. 
</P>
<P>
 And some advocates of an active U.S. role in Bosnia contend that the cautious 
approach favored by Clinton might be the most dangerous in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "A president's first responsibility is to keep the country safe and secure," 
said American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Joshua Muravchik, foreign 
policy adviser to Clinton's campaign. "If people get the feeling that this 
President is not competent at this No. 1 task, and other problems come up, such 
as the rise of a new dictatorship in Russia, then his inaction in Bosnia 
becomes not just a negative but a fatal weakness."

SERBS' WITHDRAWAL OVERSTATED, U.N. SAYS; BOSNIA: SPOKESMAN TONES DOWN 
ENTHUSIASM OVER PULLBACK. HE SAYS HANDFULS OF ARTILLERY, NOT 'CONVOYS,' ARE 
BEING REMOVED FROM SARAJEVO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief spokesman for U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia on Friday sought to tone 
down earlier enthusiasm over the first sizable pullback of heavy weapons from 
Sarajevo by rebel Serbs, saying he was wrong to have suggested entire convoys 
had been seen leaving the gun batteries ringing the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign that the artillery withdrawal remains sporadic in advance of a 1 
a.m. Monday deadline that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization set for 
punitive air strikes if the weapons are not pulled back or neutralized, Col. 
Bill Aikman amended his previous characterization of the first significant 
Bosnian Serb relocation of heavy weaponry. He said the pace had picked up from 
the few handfuls of aged artillery pieces turned over to the United Nations in 
the first week of the 10-day withdrawal period, "but to describe them as 
convoys was going too far." 
</P>
<P>
 His declaration late Thursday that U.N. monitors had watched entire convoys of 
weaponry being withdrawn suggested a mass-scale pullback by the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 In talks with U.N. Protection Force chief of mission Yasushi Akashi on Friday, 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic reiterated his promise to comply with the 
deadline for relocation or surrender of all tanks, mortars and rocket launchers 
from the high ground around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman declined to give specifics of how much weaponry has been moved out of 
the 12-mile radius of Sarajevo that NATO has ordered demilitarized. But his 
cautious descriptions of the latest withdrawals suggested they included no 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi was given assurances by both Karadzic and the greatly outgunned Bosnian 
government that they would complete the artillery surrender even 24 hours ahead 
of the deadline, said his spokesman, Peter MacFarlane. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been estimated that the Serbian nationalists, who have besieged 
Sarajevo since April, 1992, have as many as 500 heavy artillery pieces on the 
edge of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwelcome side effects of the first serious Western push to end the siege 
became clear as U.N. officials scrambled to aid the Serbs' partial retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the nearly 800 additional troops relocated to Sarajevo within the past 
few days to back 3,000 already deployed in this shattered capital were borrowed 
from other peacekeeping or aid delivery projects in the volatile region, Aikman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a crunch on. These people have jobs where they came from, and they've 
got to go back someday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. appeal for 3,000 to 4,000 more troops to enforce a cease-fire here and 
oversee the capital's demilitarization was met with resounding silence when it 
was issued last week. And the U.N. mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina is already 
short several thousand troops for protection of six "safe areas" proclaimed in 
the republic nine months ago, because contributing countries have become 
fearful of sending soldiers to what they see as a dangerous and largely 
unfocused mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The troop shortage has compelled the newly arrived U.N. commander for 
Bosnian-based forces, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, to borrow troops assigned 
to protect aid convoys in central Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman declined to say whether that action was the cause or a consequence of a 
decision by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees here to 
evacuate about 40% of its aid workers from Bosnia for security regions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a standard security measure. It's better to have a small staff during a 
tense security situation," said one official of the U.N. refugee agency, 
explaining the quiet move to get aid workers out of the areas most vulnerable 
to possible retaliation by rebel Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials have sought to cast the Serbian weapons withdrawals as solid 
evidence that the NATO ultimatum has succeeded, and some have suggested a 
similar formula of regional demilitarization might be applied throughout Bosnia 
in stages as a means of gradually ending the war that has killed well over 
200,000 and driven 2 million from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the persistent dearth of U.N. troops to enforce peace measures threatens 
to lead to a situation in which the besieging rebels simply move their 
artillery from one vulnerable region to another, drawing token U.N. deployments 
that enforce the status quo of fractured enclaves created by "ethnic 
cleansing."

NAGORNO-KARABAKH CEASE-FIRE READIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh moved toward agreement Friday on a 
cease-fire in the 6-year-old war over control of the Armenian enclave inside 
Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Itar-Tass news agency said the accord was reached in Moscow during talks 
mediated by Russian Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev.A protocol was signed by 
the defense ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and a negotiator from the 
enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 The protocol must still be signed by the political leadership of the three 
sides before it can be implemented and a date set for the truce to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 15,000 people have been killed and 1 million have become refugees in 
the battle for control of Nagorno-Karabakh after the mainly Armenian population 
of the enclave began a campaign for independence in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense officials in Nagorno-Karabakh reported heavy fighting Friday after 
Armenian troops repelled an Azerbaijani offensive in the Omar Pass region of 
the mountainous enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said Azerbaijan suffered hundreds of casualties, and Armenian 
forces were in complete control of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides routinely exaggerate the losses of the other, and the figures could 
not be independently confirmed.

 Pope John Paul II may return to the United States this year, on a lightning 
East Coast visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican sources said Friday the 73-year-old pontiff hopes to address the 
United Nations in New York as it observes its 50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning is incomplete, but the late October stop in New York could be 
followed by short pastoral visits to Newark, N.J., and Baltimore, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither city has been among the Pope's stops on three previous U.S. visits, 
the last to Denver in August to mark his church's World Youth Day. John Paul 
last addressed the General Assembly in 1979 on his first U.S. visit the year 
after he was elected.

IN VIRGINIA'S VULTURE CULTURE, GUARD PETS AND 'DON'T LIE DOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYLOU TOUSIGNANT, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a loaded shotgun sitting next to her back door, Lynn O'Hara-Yates says 
she's living in terror of the dozens of black vultures that gather each morning 
on her back fence to stretch their wings, sharpen their talons and wait for 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, "lunch" has meant assorted pets in her Stafford County, Va., 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 When O'Hara-Yates tried to rescue one of her ducks last month, a vulture 
swooped down, whooshing within three feet of her head. The birds attacked again 
this week as she filmed them circling over children getting off a school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like something out of (Alfred Hitchcock's) 'The Birds,' " the 
42-year-old flight attendant said. "They're scary as hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Kings Grant development have counted about 200 vultures 
roosting in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first birds showed up in November, they were a curiosity. As their 
numbers multiplied, curiosity turned into concern despite assurances from state 
wildlife specialists and longtime residents that the huge birds wouldn't harm a 
living thing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last month, O'Hara-Yates has lost eight ducks from her pond, all of 
them picked clean to the bone. Her neighbor's cat, Stripe, was grabbed by the 
tail and carried 25 feet in the air for a distance of 100 yards. A vet stitched 
up the four talon holes in Stripe's body. Dogs and horses also have been 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightmare," said Stripe's owner, Jeude Barrett. "And we can't do 
anything. . . . They have no fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say they've been told that the harsh winter has exacerbated the 
problem, reducing the amount of "road kill" on which the birds normally dine. 
</P>
<P>
 Vultures are federally protected animals and cannot be killed without a 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those spotted in Kings Grant are black vultures, which weigh about 
five pounds and have a wingspan up to six feet. Black vultures are more 
aggressive than their cousin, the red-headed turkey vulture, and are common to 
the South, according to Paul Engman, a naturalist who works for the Fairfax 
County Park Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds, commonly called buzzards, prefer their food either dead or dying, 
Engman said, but on rare occasions have been known to swoop down on live 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Thomas, an inspector for the Virginia Department of Agriculture and 
Consumer Services, says he has seen horses, lambs, pigs and newborn calves 
attacked. Incidents have been reported in four other Virginia counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who is working to rid the Kings Grant area of its vultures, said he 
understands residents' concerns. "I would not be comfortable with a 2-year-old 
child playing around them. When they're hungry, meat's meat." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara-Yates said a game warden advised her that she would be safe while 
feeding the animals on her 14-acre property, but, he warned, "Whatever you do, 
don't lie down."

JUDGE ORDERS KEVORKIAN TO BE TRIED IN ASSISTED SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge refused Friday to dismiss the last remaining charge against retired 
pathologist Jack Kevorkian and ordered him to stand trial in the assisted 
suicide of a man with Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Recorder's Court Judge Thomas E. Jackson set the trial for April 19, 
saying he was not bound by previous rulings that Michigan's blanket ban on 
assisted suicide is unconstitutional. Three other charges have been dismissed 
by other judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, who advocates physician-aided suicide for the terminally ill, said 
a trial would be a "farce." He has been present at the deaths of 20 people 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's going to trample my rights," he said after Friday's hearing. "This 
trial is a touch of the Inquisition." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian is charged with helping Thomas Hyde commit suicide last summer. He 
faces up to four years in prison and a $2,000 fine if convicted in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers want to introduce as evidence a videotape of the 30-year-old 
Hyde -- who could barely speak, swallow or move -- asking Kevorkian to help him 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Tim Kenny is trying to block introduction of 
that tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, it's an emotional tape that generates a lot of sympathy for the 
defense," Kenny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyde died on Aug. 4 in the back of Kevorkian's 1968 Volkswagen van. Kevorkian 
called police to the van, where they found Hyde wearing an oxygen mask hooked 
to a carbon monoxide canister. 
</P>
<P>
 Three circuit court judges in Michigan have found the state's assisted suicide 
law unconstitutional on various grounds and dismissed three other charges 
against Kevorkian. The Michigan Court of Appeals is considering appeals of 
those rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny said he would have preferred to wait for the higher court ruling before 
proceeding with the trial. But Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's attorney, said he 
wanted to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be held hostage here. We want to go to trial," Fieger told 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian has at times gone to jail, staged a hunger strike and worn an 
electronic ankle bracelet under house arrest in his battle against the assisted 
suicide law. It was enacted by the Legislature last year specifically to stop 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Free on bail in the Hyde case, he is now leading a petition drive for a state 
constitutional amendment to declare assisted suicide a fundamental 
constitutional right.

TEXAS OFFICIALS INVESTIGATE DEATH OF PROSTITUTION RING SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state employee who was fired this week after being accused of running a 
prostitution ring from his office was found shot to death Friday, apparently 
from a self-inflicted wound, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 James A. Bunch, 46, who had worked for 23 years at the Department of Human 
Services, was found in a parking lot near his office. He had been fired Tuesday 
after being arrested on charges of aggravated promotion of prostitution, which 
is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest had set off intense speculation in the state capital about the 400 
or so clients of Aimes Escorts whose names and sexual preferences were listed 
on index cards seized by police. Authorities said Bunch ran the business for 
two years by using a state computer and telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Police confirmed that a state legislator was among the clients listed, but 
declined to identify the occupations of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch was interrogated after his arrest but did not appear to be distraught or 
suicidal, Deputy Chief Ken Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been my experience that when people . . . take their own lives, many 
times they do it in an area that is familiar to them, whether that be their 
home or their business," Police Lt. David Parkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent suicide left his co-workers shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our staff is still in a state of shock about the whole incident," said 
Mike Jones, an agency spokesman. "We are just an agency of about 17,000 people 
and most of us come to work every morning and just do our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch had said Thursday that the case had been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to cooperate," he told the Associated Press. "I want to help. But you 
need to talk with my attorney. I'm sorry I can't help more." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they found a .38-caliber pistol near Bunch's body and some 
"written material," which they declined to release, in his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkinson said an employee arriving for work found Bunch's body just after 7 
a.m. in a remote part of the agency's parking lot.

LIBEL SUIT IS REINSTATED FOR BOOK REVIEW IN N.Y. TIMES; LAW: APPEALS COURT 
ALLOWS $10-MILLION ACTION, SAYING CRITICISM IS HELD TO SAME STANDARD AS NEWS 
STORIES. WRITER ON NFL HAD BEEN CALLED 'SLOPPY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S. appeals court reinstated a $10-million lawsuit Friday against the New 
York Times for publishing a harshly critical book review, a decision libel 
experts said could make critics think twice about panning a book, play, movie 
or restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 opinion, the court said that a reviewer's comment that a book on the 
National Football League and organized crime contained "too much sloppy 
journalism" could be the basis for a libel verdict if a jury concludes the 
statement was false. 
</P>
<P>
 Book reviews, like news stories, can result in damage verdicts "if they imply 
a provably false fact," Judge Harry Edwards wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless overturned on appeal, the ruling will give author and investigative 
reporter Dan E. Moldea a chance to convince a jury that his book was factual 
and accurate, not sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
 "For an author, a harsh review in the New York Times Book Review is at least 
as damaging as accusations of incompetence made against an attorney or a 
surgeon in a legal or medical journal," Edwards added. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dissenting judge complained that the opinion "opens up the entire 
arena of artistic criticism to mass defamation suits." 
</P>
<P>
 "If a statement that Mr. Moldea wrote a sloppy book is defamatory, so would be 
a statement that Bette Midler wore a sloppy dress, or that Oliver Stone made a 
sloppy film, or that Itzhak Perlman had a sloppy technique," wrote Chief Judge 
Abner Mikva in his dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ruling illustrates a new trend in libel law. Since 1990, courts have 
increasingly held critics and opinion writers to the same strict standards for 
accuracy as news reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Before then, critics, columnists and editorial writers generally were seen as 
immune from libel suits because their words were labeled opinion, not fact. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Supreme Court threw out that distinction in 1990, ruling that false 
statements of fact in an opinion column can be the basis for a libel verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simply couching a statement -- 'Jones is a liar' -- in terms of opinion -- 
'In my opinion, Jones is liar' -- does not dispel the factual implications 
contained in the statement," wrote Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in the 
case of Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's decision relied heavily on that high court opinion. In recent years, 
other judges have permitted damage suits against restaurant reviewers and news 
commentators who misstated the facts in the midst of a harsh commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 But one leading libel expert said he feared that applying strict libel law to 
critics and commentators could force them to muffle their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sends a message that it is open season on reviewers who make candid, 
acerbic comments," said Rodney Smolla, a First Amendment expert at the College 
of William and Mary. "If you think a book or play was really bad, you would 
have to think twice about saying that. "My question is, do we want these 
decisions made in a courtroom, or do we want to let these matters be settled in 
the marketplace of reviews?" 
</P>
<P>
 But a lawyer who represented Moldea praised the ruling as a "victory for the 
small guy" against the most powerful force in book publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 When Moldea's book, "Interference: How Organized Crime Influences Professional 
Football," first appeared in 1989, it gained quick attention and had good 
prospects for selling well, according to his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Sept. 3, 1989, the New York Times printed a sharply critical review by 
Times sports writer Gerald Eskenazi, which said that the book was full of 
"errors and unfounded insinuations." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Eskenazi wrote: "(Moldea) revives the discredited notion that 
Carroll Rosenbloom, the ornery owner of the (Los Angeles) Rams, met foul play 
when he drowned in Florida 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Edwards noted, however, that while Moldea quotes friends of Rosenbloom 
who believe he was murdered, he concluded this section by saying: "In short, 
the evidence appears to be clear that Rosenbloom died in a tragic accident and 
was not murdered." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Roger C. Simmons, the author's attorney: "We believe we can prove that 
kind of assertion (by Eskenazi) had no factual basis. And it had a devastating 
impact on (Moldea's) career."  
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Moldea sent a letter of reply to the New York Times soon after 
Eskenazi's review appeared, but it was not printed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had printed his reply, there would never (have) been a case," Simmons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the New York Times said that it would ask the full appeals 
court to reconsider the ruling by the three-judge panel. If that fails, the 
newspaper could ask the Supreme Court to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very disappointed in the majority's ruling, which we feel has been 
wrongly decided because it does not give sufficient constitutional protection 
for expressions of opinion in a review," the New York Times said.

RENO UNVEILS 'SWAMP CAMP' IN FLORIDA; CRIME: DETENTION CENTER WILL PUT YOUNG 
OFFENDERS TO WORK ON ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP PROJECTS. THEY WILL ALSO RECEIVE 
COUNSELING AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno traveled Friday to one of the most remote spots in 
Florida -- a vast, watery prairie filled with alligators and poisonous snakes 
-- to announce the Clinton Administration's latest response to violent juvenile 
crime: swamp camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp, modeled on the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, is the 
first of what White House officials envision as "last chance" detention centers 
on federal lands where felons under the age of 18 will work on environmental 
cleanup projects while providing low-cost labor to the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a Senate resolution passed last November, the Youth Environmental 
Service camps will be administered jointly by the Justice Department and the 
Interior Department. Other YES camps are being planned in Utah and at the 
National Arboretum in Washington, D.C., while the Department of Agriculture is 
looking at setting up similar camps in national forests in Oregon, North 
Carolina and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida camp, based at the site of an abandoned sawmill, will house up to 
20 young offenders convicted of crimes such as murder, rape or violent 
robberies. Under the direction of counselors rather than guards, they will 
spend up to a year eradicating exotic weed trees, clearing trails and building 
boardwalks. They also will receive counseling and vocational training. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have messed up the children of America too long over the past 30 to 40 
years," Reno said. "We have been indifferent to their problems. We've also 
messed up the environment." The camps, she said, offer a chance to help both. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno was joined at the dedication ceremony by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt 
and Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), who as the state's governor 12 years ago helped 
design a prototype of the Big Cypress camp. 
</P>
<P>
 That camp -- located near the northern edge of the Everglades in Venus, Fla. 
-- is operated by a private company, Associated Marine Institutes of Tampa, 
which has been contracted to run the Big Cypress camp. The cost will be paid by 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said he hopes to see the YES camps spread across the United States as a 
way "to get dangerous juveniles off the streets and into programs that work." 
He said serious offenders could be placed in remote settings such as Big 
Cypress, which is about 70 miles west of Miami, while nonviolent delinquents 
could work on government lands closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Attending the dedication ceremony were several youths now at the Venus camp, 
as well as a recent graduate who told Reno that the experience changed his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned how to discipline myself, I learned about the work ethic and how to 
have respect," said Demetrice Lee, 18, convicted of murder for his role in a 
1992 St. Petersburg pawn shop robbery in which his accomplice was killed. "This 
camp will work for those who want to help themselves and turn their lives 
around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who has completed one year of community college and works full time in a 
fast-food restaurant, was lauded by Reno as "representing the future of 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us reach out to children like Demetrice Lee and give them the love and 
structure they need," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said that although she supports some version of the so-called 
three-strikes-and-you're-out measure, in which repeat felons could be jailed 
for life, many young offenders could be better served by such camps. 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication ceremony, held in a National Park Service garage rather than at 
the campsite because of heavy rain, was a homecoming for Reno, a Miami native 
and former Dade County state attorney who has a passion for hiking through both 
the Everglades and the adjacent Big Cypress preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive west from Miami, Reno said she delighted in identifying for 
Babbitt the various herons, egrets and other wading birds that are abundant 
along the highway.

RENO SENDS MEDIATORS INTO ANTI-GAY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has ordered Justice Department mediators into their 
first case involving anti-gay harassment and threats, sending them to a tiny 
south Mississippi town where residents led by Baptist ministers are trying to 
close a feminist camp run by two lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 Two mediators from the department's Community Relations Service arrived Friday 
in Ovett, Miss. -- population 400 -- after Reno wrote a gay-rights group: "I 
consider the threat of violence in Ovett to be real." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno's order is the latest sign of the Clinton Administration's sensitivity to 
gay issues. Earlier in the week, President Clinton wrote a letter opposing 
state and local referendums designed to block gay civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Senate for the first time confirmed an openly gay official, 
Roberta Achtenberg, Clinton's nominee for a housing post. But Clinton angered 
as many gays as he pleased by watering down his plan to end the ban on 
homosexuals serving openly in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Reno ordered the FBI to investigate after Wanda Henson, 39, and 
Brenda Henson, 48, who set up Camp Sister Spirit on a 120-acre former pig farm 
outside Ovett, received a handwritten threat in the mail. Mailing such a threat 
could be a federal offense. They have also received telephoned threats and have 
locked the camp entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who consider themselves married, have about 20 women in residence 
helping rebuild the farm. They say they want to hold workshops on sexual 
harassment, sexual abuse and women's legal rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation in Ovett has clearly been dangerous since the time a dead dog 
was hung on the Hensons' mailbox and town meetings were held denouncing the 
women and pledging to drive them from town," said Peri Jude Radecic, director 
of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, which sought Reno's help in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 350 people gathered in nearby Ellisville at a meeting organized by 
the Rev. John Allen, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Richton, who said: 
"We are being invaded by activists with a radical agenda . . . people who are 
different and want to change our community." Donations were collected for a 
lawsuit aimed at closing the camp.

ROSTENKOWSKI'S REELECTION BID CREATING HIGH DRAMA; POLITICS: PRIMARY ELECTION 
IS NO SHOO-IN FOR ONCE UNSTOPPABLE HOUSE LEADER. NOW HE IS A TARGET OF TWO 
PROBES AND FACES TWO STRONG CHALLENGES. 
</P>

<P>
 The Democratic voters of Illinois' 5th Congressional District, a 
conglomeration of wealthy liberals, young families, gays and white ethnic 
working-class households, will make a choice on March 15 that could have an 
impact far beyond their slice of this city's north side. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, the powerful chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee, is making a bid for his 19th term in Washington, and the 
race is by no means decided. 
</P>
<P>
 A key player in the Clinton Administration's strategy for passing health care 
reform, Rostenkowski is under investigation in both Washington and Chicago. 
Allegations range from misuse of House Post Office money to padding his payroll 
with "ghost" employees. He has denied any wrongdoing, though he announced 
recently that he had reimbursed the federal Treasury for $82,000 in 
questionable purchases at the House stationery store. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this backdrop, challengers have created a drama in the upcoming 
primary election that would have been unthinkable a mere two terms ago. 
Rostenkowski has not one, but two, strong challengers from his own party in a 
field of five candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Simpson, a University of Illinois professor and a former Chicago 
alderman, did well against the incumbent in 1992. State Sen. John Cullerton, a 
party regular who entered the fray just last month, has quickly turned the 
rematch into a three-way competition. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Rostenkowski had seemed impervious to any opposition, rarely 
garnering less than 60% of the vote. Two years ago, in a redrawn district, he 
had serious primary opposition from Simpson, who had a political base in the 
liberal lakefront sectors. But Rostenkowski still won his party's nomination -- 
tantamount in Chicago to taking the seat itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, before the general election, the U.S. attorney in Washington issued 
subpoenas in the post office scandal. Rostenkowski took "just" 57% of the vote 
against Elias R. Non-Incumbent Zenkich -- the Republican challenger who had 
officially changed his name. By comparison, Rostenkowski had pulled in 79% of 
the general-election vote in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed even harder as the probe expanded, the 66-year-old Rostenkowski has 
been marshaling his forces of late. This week, U.S. Labor Secretary Robert B. 
Reich and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley offered strong testimonials during an 
appearance in the district. There is talk that President Clinton may visit 
before Election Day as well. And Rostenkowski is expected to launch a costly 
advertising campaign soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Tribune has endorsed him, in what the paper described as "a 
difficult call." An editorial said that "some of his actions have invited 
public distrust," but it cited "his long and impressive record of achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's supporters suspect that Cullerton's belated arrival on the ballot 
could also turn out to be one of Rostenkowski's secret weapons. If the 
anti-Rostenkowski vote splits between the two main challengers, the incumbent 
could snag a narrow victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cullerton has always been a loyal (Democratic) machine guy," said Tom Gradel, 
president of Simpson's campaign committee. "He's always voted with the machine. 
He depends on the machine support so if they really wanted him out of the race, 
they could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Gradel's mind, Cullerton believes "either he would cause Simpson to be 
defeated and get Rostenkowski in, or things split outright, he would be 
elected. He won either way." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Cullerton is ill-cast as an opponent of the Establishment's man. 
Someone from the Cullerton clan has held elective office in Chicago since 1870. 
The congressional candidate's cousins and uncles have held the titles of 
alderman, state representative, county assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 At 45, Cullerton has been a state senator for three years, and a 
representative for the 12 previous years. He had said publicly he would not run 
for Congress unless Rostenkowski decided not to run, but in the fall his 
attitude began to change. Some Democratic committeemen grew alarmed enough 
about the unfolding investigations to pick names out of the phone book and 
place calls in every ward in the 5th District, inquiring about Rostenkowski's 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results we got were astonishing," said Bernie Hansen, the 44th Ward 
committeeman, a Chicago alderman -- and a neighbor of Cullerton's. "It wasn't 
just the charges; they didn't like his attitude, like he was arrogant, like he 
was above it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen said he and others encouraged Cullerton to finance a professional 
survey. In January, he said, the results showed that 67% of the 500 people 
polled wanted a new representative in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Preferring Cullerton to the more maverick-style Simpson, Hansen urged his 
neighbor to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 The state senator differentiates himself from Simpson by arguing that he is 
more effective. He has not concentrated on the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to attack Dan Rostenkowski? No," said Dana DeBeaumont, press 
secretary for the Cullerton campaign. "We don't need to. The media (are) doing 
a very good job of informing the people about his troubles." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Rostenkowski should not be counted out. He "has been underestimated

 In the district, both the arguments for and against are clearly potent. "I 
think he stole," said Matt Furlin, a 33-year-old contractor who has voted for 
"Rosty" in the past. "I have to pay for my sins. Why shouldn't he have to?" But 
in the next breath, he added that Rostenkowski "brings home the bacon."

 William L. Webster, the former Missouri attorney general whose once-golden 
political career was destroyed by scandal, began a two-year sentence in federal 
prison.Webster reported to a prison camp in Florence, Colo., after being 
convicted of conspiring to use state resources for his political campaigns. 
Webster, the 1992 Republican nominee for Missouri governor, accused federal 
prosecutors of a witch hunt to discredit him. He pleaded guilty last summer to 
conspiracy and misapplying state resources to his campaign by using state 
employees, equipment and supplies for political purposes.

 The federal government told parents they never should let their infant 
children ride in the front seat of a car that has a passenger-side air bag.The 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that if an air bag deploys, 
a child facing the rear -- as recommended by safety experts -- could be killed 
or severely injured. The bag inflates with such force, the agency said, that 
the impact can snap a baby's neck or cause severe brain damage. The agency said 
it will require the manufacturers of child-safety seats to put warning labels 
on them stating that children never should be put in the front seat in a car 
with a passenger-side air bag.

U.S. COURT UPHOLDS BAN ON MEDICINAL USE OF POT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court refused Friday to force the government to allow the 
use of marijuana for medical reasons by people suffering from cancer, AIDS and 
other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the 
George Bush Administration's 1992 decision barring doctors from prescribing 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision was supported by substantial evidence, the court said, noting 
that many medical experts testified "that marijuana's medicinal value has never 
been proven in sound scientific studies." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has said it is reconsidering the ban, and Arnold 
Trebach of the private Drug Policy Foundation urged the government to reverse 
the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball is in Mr. Clinton's court," Trebach said. "He can look up and say: 
'Enough of this foolishness.' He can do something compassionate." 
</P>
<P>
 Trebach said an appeal to the Supreme Court would be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the medical use of marijuana say there is strong evidence that 
it eases the nausea and loss of appetite caused by cancer and AIDS treatments, 
eases muscle spasms for people with spinal cord injuries or multiple sclerosis 
and alleviates the eye pressure that blinds glaucoma sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people were allowed to obtain permission from the Food and Drug 
Administration to use marijuana for such purposes starting in 1976. A few of 
those people are still allowed to use marijuana, but new requests have not been 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court said the Bush Administration showed a "reasonable preference 
for rigorous scientific proof over anecdotal evidence, even when reported by 
respected physicians." 
</P>
<P>
 The court also rejected claims that Bush Administration officials had a 
history of prejudice against the medical use of marijuana.

 The 23 states that have taken the brunt of this winter's icy blast will 
receive $300 million in federal emergency home-heating aid, President Clinton 
announced.The money will be distributed by the Department of Health and Human 
Services under a new formula intended to channel aid to those states that have 
had the worst weather and also have large numbers of low-income households. The 
targeted states, in the East and Midwest, had January temperatures totaling 100 
"degree days" more than their 30-year average. Degree days are a measure of 
cold. The higher the number of degree days, the colder the weather.

 The Marie Stopes Health Clinic in London said it has won British Health 
Department approval for American women to use the RU-486 abortion pill, but 
they will have to buy a plane ticket to London and pay a $500 fee to do it. 
Anti-abortion groups called the decision a public relations stunt designed to 
promote what they see as a potentially dangerous pill and to force it on the 
U.S. market. But abortion-rights advocates hailed the decision as a major 
victory for women who want abortions but do not want to undergo a possibly 
dangerous surgical procedure.

HEALTH ALLIANCE DETRACTORS GAINING THE UPPER HAND; INSURANCE: THEIR FEARS OF 
GIGANTIC BUREAUCRACIES FIND GROWING SUPPORT. REJECTION OF PURCHASING NETWORK 
CONCEPT COULD DOOM CLINTON'S PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To President Clinton, the gigantic purchasing alliances that constitute a 
central pillar of his proposed health reform plan would give consumers wider 
choices of health care plans and greater bargaining power versus hospitals and 
doctors -- plus a welcome guarantee that health insurers could not reject them. 
</P>
<P>
 To critics, the alliances are simply mammoth bureaucracies that would strangle 
competition, deny individual businesses the right to tailor health benefits to 
their own workers' needs and force individuals to give up their family doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Which of these visions comes closer to the probable reality? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Clinton, his critics are making considerable headway in 
convincing Congress of the negative view. And if their efforts ultimately 
succeed, it will be bad news for the President: Without health purchasing 
alliances, his entire plan could come tumbling down. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is counting on the alliances to hold down runaway medical costs. And 
if costs cannot be contained, his reform plan could quickly turn into another 
ruinously expensive government entitlement program run by an entrenched federal 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are looking at the beginning of a monstrous and potentially powerful 
agency . . . a massive bureaucracy erected to hide a government program," said 
Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.). "It's not at all clear who they will answer to, 
and I fear they will be accountable to no one." 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, the alliances offend some of the most powerful special 
interests in the health care debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies fear the alliances would squeeze them out of most of their 
medical business. Big corporations argue that, having only recently gained a 
modicum of control of their employees' health costs, they would lose that 
control to the alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress passes the President's proposal, "we're out of the benefits 
business -- we lose complete control of the system and it's all up to the 
government," said Dan Spiller, manager of benefit plans for the Mead Corp. 
"That's completely unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 These mysterious alliances, in simplest terms, are not quite so exotic as they 
may seem. The basic principle they rest on is one that big businesses, chain 
stores and discount merchandisers have followed for decades: centralize your 
purchasing to take advantage of economies of scale. 
</P>
<P>
 A supermarket chain that orders potatoes by the ton and cornflakes by the 
boxcar can negotiate better prices than the old mom-and-pop groceries that buy 
by the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a health care alliance representing several thousand consumers can 
theoretically drive a sharper bargain with networks of health care providers 
than individual patients could. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, large companies that provide health care benefits for their employees 
are already operating just like Clinton's proposed alliances. They now approach 
hospitals, groups of doctors and other providers and say, in effect, "We will 
deliver large numbers of patients -- and thus profits -- if you will cut us a 
deal on the price." The resulting agreements have brought changes and savings 
to employer-supplied health care programs in almost every corner of American 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 On a smaller scale, farmers in many parts of the country have long joined 
together in cooperatives to buy seed and fertilizer and other commodities at 
lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, families in cities sometimes form food-buying cooperatives to get 
better quality and better prices on such things as fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton's plan became law, almost all Americans would belong to the health 
alliance serving their state or region. The major exceptions would be those who 
were covered by Medicare and, in some cases, those who worked for companies 
with more than 5,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Each alliance would act as the sole health care purchasing agent for almost 
everyone in its region. It would negotiate with health maintenance 
organizations and insurance companies for the best deals for its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from that, their very size would allow the alliances to spread the costs 
of particularly expensive medical treatments over large groups, thus limiting 
insurers' exposure when they have to cover the elderly and the ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alliances are designed to end discrimination in the marketplace," White 
House senior health adviser Ira Magaziner said. "It is not right that because 
of your age or health status you pay more. If you want to achieve an end to 
discrimination, you need a large pool." 
</P>
<P>
 State governments would decide on the alliances' geographical boundaries and 
select their boards of directors, which would have to be equally divided 
between consumers and business representatives. No one working in the health 
industry -- doctors, nurses, hospital employees or insurance company employees 
-- could serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year a newly created federal agency called the National Health Board 
would set a target for total health care spending in the nation and give each 
regional alliance a corresponding budget target. The alliance would use its 
authority over fees and charges to keep spending at the required level. 
</P>
<P>
 A market such as Los Angeles would have one alliance, but the alliance could 
approve 10 or more health plans, probably including such well-known names as 
Kaiser Permanente, Blue Cross, Aetna and Prudential, for its individual members 
to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 All these vendors would be required to offer a standard, comprehensive set of 
benefits more generous than currently offered by most employers. Plans could 
offer extra benefits, such as prescription eyeglasses and cosmetic surgery, for 
extra charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a year, consumers could choose among the approved health plans. They 
could still go outside the doctors and hospitals that participate in their 
plans, but they would have to pay out of their own pockets for the medical care 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the theory. Proponents say it would achieve its goals with little or 
no pain to consumers or to providers -- if they are reasonable in their charges 
and efficient in their operations. Certainly the alliances would be far less 
bureaucratic than the paper shufflers who operate today's health care system, 
says Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.). 
</P>
<P>
 Critics reject that view and argue that the reality of the alliances would 
turn out to be anything but benign. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the impartial Congressional Budget Office, in its analysis of the Clinton 
plan, warned that the inexperienced alliances could be overwhelmed by their 
enormous job. 
</P>
<P>
 And not surprisingly, many segments of the existing health care industry worry 
about what the alliances would mean for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost are health insurance companies. The big ones, such as Aetna and 
Prudential, would probably assume the job of stitching doctors and hospitals 
into the provider networks that the alliances would offer to their members. 
</P>
<P>
 But they resist the degree of government supervision that the Clinton plan 
entails. And the small insurers worry that they would have no role at all. 
</P>
<P>
 In a television commercial sponsored by the Health Insurance Assn. of America, 
a young, concerned couple worries that "thousands of government bureaucrats" 
would dictate their health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses are no happier with the prospect that the alliances would wrest 
from them the control they now exercise over their own benefits programs. They 
don't trust the President enough to surrender that power to him, even in return 
for his promise to hold down health costs nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton launched his crusade for health reform, he counted on big 
business -- beset as it was by rising medical care costs -- to rally around his 
plan. After months of intense flirting, entreating and cajoling, however, the 
White House still has failed to enlist any significant business backing for 
health alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract big business support, the President's plan would allow companies 
with 5,000 or more workers to stay outside the regional alliances and create 
their own "corporate alliances." 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said recently that the 5,000 threshold could 
be lowered. 
</P>
<P>
 Business was not impressed. It argues that the gigantic regional alliances 
would so dominate the purchasing of health care that even the biggest 
companies, unable to compete, would have no choice but to join them. And it 
strongly objects to the 1% payroll tax that business would have to pay for the 
privilege of maintaining corporate alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Many executives refuse to believe the White House claim that corporations 
under the Clinton plan would spend no more than 7.9% of their payroll to buy 
insurance packages that include comprehensive coverage for doctor and hospital 
bills plus payments for prescription drugs and home care for the chronically 
ill.

novels about the siege of what was then known as Leningrad. The Soviet Union 
rewarded him with the Stalin Prize in 1950 and the Order of the Red Banner of 
Labor in 1963. He was one of the few Soviet writers allowed to travel abroad 
and his works were regularly published. He lost his job with Literaturnaya

LOIS PEYSER; SCREENWRITER TAUGHT AT AFI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lois Peyser, an award-winning screenwriter and the first person hired to teach 
that subject when the American Film Institute began offering writing classes, 
died Friday at her Brentwood home. She was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman said she had lost a two-year battle with ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 With her husband, Arnold Peyser, she had a string of successes in film and 
television writing. One of the high points of her career came in 1988 when she 
was honored with the Writers Guild Valentine Davies award, given annually to 
one who has "brought dignity and honor to writers everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 She was praised as a writer and mentor, and the couple were regulars on 
episodic television. Their credits include multiple scripts for "My Three 
Sons," "The Dick Van Dyke Show," "Love, American Style," "Mission: Impossible" 
and many more. 
</P>
<P>
 They also wrote for many of the best dramatic shows on TV, including the 
Alcoa, Goodyear and General Electric series. A videocassette of their Elvis 
Presley picture, "The Trouble With Girls," was recently released, while their 
latest work was the Fred Allen play "From Boston to Portland," which opened in 
Boston last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, the American Film Institute hired her to start a screenwriting class 
and she taught and offered seminars at AFI while serving as a consultant for 
the Directing Women's Workshops and as a teacher in Brussels, Moscow and 
Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her husband of 45 years, she is survived by two sons, three 
grandchildren, two sisters and a brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Private services are scheduled for Feb. 25 at noon at the Mark Goodson Theater 
at AFI. Donations may be made to the Lois Peyser Scholarship Fund for beginning 
writers at AFI.

$5.8 MILLION, 1,000 POUNDS OF COCAINE SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Federal and local authorities in Ventura County have seized $5.8 million and 
nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine as part of a three-year nationwide 
money-laundering and drug-trafficking case targeting the two major Colombian 
cartels. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover operation, based in Ventura County, led to the arrest of one 
high-ranking member of the Cali cartel and 17 other members of the Cali and 
Medellin cartels.No details of the arrests were given, nor were the suspects 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 More arrests are expected when authorities seek a dozen federal indictments in 
the case next week. Five suspects have been secretly indicted in Los Angeles 
and Detroit, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Ventura on Friday, Sheriff Larry Carpenter said the 
case represents the largest confiscation of drug money in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to $2 million of the seized cash could be returned to the Sheriff's 
Department through federal asset forfeiture laws, he said. The money was seized 
at a variety of locations in several states over two years, including $1 
million last month in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint investigation by U.S. Customs officials and Ventura County deputies 
was launched in October, 1991, when an informant arranged a meeting at a 
Thousand Oaks hotel between undercover sheriff's deputies and a high-level Cali 
drug trafficker. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover agents infiltrated both Colombian cartels and met with traffickers 
in Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit, Chicago, New York and Newark, the sheriff 
said. Authorities say the two cartels are responsible for most of the cocaine 
imported into this country. 
</P>
<P>
 To gain greater access to the cartels, drug agents set up an illegitimate 
money-laundering organization based in eastern Ventura County that charged a 
fee to deposit drug profits in U.S. and foreign banks. The sums averaged about 
$500,000, but ranged from $100,000 to several million, federal authorities 
said.

SIMI VALLEY BOY, 13, PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO KILLING CLASSMATE, 14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 13-year-old Simi Valley boy charged with fatally stabbing a junior high 
school classmate pleaded not guilty Friday in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Steven Z. Perren set an April 18 trial for the boy, who will be tried as 
a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
 He is charged with a single count of murder in the Feb. 1 death of 14-year-old 
Chad Patrick Hubbard, a popular student and member of the baseball team at 
Valley View Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students have said the two boys had a running feud that escalated a week 
before the stabbing when the boy took Chad's baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen of Chad's relatives and friends appeared at Friday's 
arraignment. The boy's mother, grandmother and an aunt were also present in 
court. Both families declined to comment afterward.

PROSECUTORS WANT MENENDEZ RETRIAL MOVED DOWNTOWN; DEFENSE OBJECTS; COURTS: 
QUAKE DAMAGE IS CITED IN REQUEST FOR TRANSFER FROM VAN NUYS. OBSERVERS SAY 
MANEUVERING SHOWS THAT BOTH SIDES SEE JURY SELECTION AS CRUCIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Prosecutors asked a judge Friday to move the retrial of the Menendez brothers 
Downtown, saying the earthquake-battered Van Nuys courthouse can no longer 
handle the high-profile proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense attorney said she would oppose the move. 
</P>
<P>
 In legal papers that arrived late Friday at Van Nuys Superior Court, 
prosecutors noted that the Jan. 17 quake damaged several floors of that 
courthouse. It also led to the closure of the multilevel parking structure 
across the street that serves court staff and jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under those conditions, prosecutors argued, it would be unreasonable to burden 
the courthouse with the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez, charged with murder 
in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their parents. The Downtown Criminal 
Courts Building, prosecutors noted, is "fully operational." 
</P>
<P>
 A move Downtown would also bring the case closer to Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti 
and his top lieutenants, who are under pressure to produce a conviction at a 
second trial. Garcetti has vowed that there will be no plea bargains, and that 
it will be tried again "as a murder case -- because that's what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, admit they killed their wealthy 
parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and Kitty Menendez, 47, in the TV room of the 
family's Beverly Hills mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend that the brothers killed out of hatred and greed. But the 
brothers said they killed out of fear fed by years of physical, emotional and 
sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 After six months of trial, separate juries, one for each brother, were unable 
last month to reach a verdict on either murder or manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg has scheduled a Feb. 28 hearing to 
set a new trial date. Prosecutors asked Weisberg to also consider the move 
Downtown at that hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Bozanich, the lead prosecutor, declined to elaborate 
on the transfer request. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Jill Lansing said the place for a transfer -- if there is to 
be one -- is to Santa Monica, the courthouse nearest Beverly Hills, where the 
slayings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has always been our request that it be handled in Santa Monica," Lansing 
said. "If not in Santa Monica, I'm not sure what the rationale is for having it 
in the Criminal Courts Building." 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale, prosecutors said in legal papers, is that the brothers were 
indicted Downtown and the transfer would simply be moving the case "back to the 
courthouse from which it came." 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal observers suggested that the maneuvering over the site of a retrial 
was evidence of the belief on both sides that the outcome of the retrial could 
hinge on jury selection. They said prosecutors probably believe that the 
blue-collar jury pool Downtown is likely to be less sympathetic to the 
brothers' emotional claims of abuse than the suburban jury pool in the San 
Fernando Valley -- and far less sympathetic than in affluent Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 From the prosecutors' perspective, said defense lawyer Harland W. Braun, "it 
doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where it should go." 
</P>
<P>
 Some pre-indictment hearings in the case were held in Santa Monica, but the 
trial was moved to Van Nuys when it was assigned to Weisberg, who is based 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the Downtown Criminal Courts Building offers the added 
advantage of high-security courtrooms, which would "be ideal for controlling 
media access to the trial proceedings and for insulating jurors from media 
contact."

MAHONY BACKS LEADERS OF CONFERENCE; CONFERENCE: CARDINAL OPENS GATHERING BY 
OFFERING SUPPORT FOR A NUN AND CONVENTION ORGANIZER WHO HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED BY 
CONSERVATIVE CATHOLICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger M. Mahony on Friday opened a religious congress by declaring 
his uncompromising support for two church officials under attack by 
conservative Catholics as "dissenters in sheep's clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony's backing of a leading nun in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles and a conference organizer of the annual religious event -- said to be 
the largest catechetical gathering in the world -- was greeted with an ovation 
from an estimated 10,000 delegates during the morning's welcoming services at 
the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the three-day convention, more than 20,000 delegates from as far as Poland 
and the Philippines are expected to participate in 240 educational workshops 
offering a range of topics from "Understanding HIV Infection and AIDS" to 
"Getting to Know Jesus Better." 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening remarks, Mahony rose to defend Sister Edith Prendergast and 
conference coordinator Adrian Whitaker. Earlier this month, a small coalition 
of conservative Catholic groups demanded their resignations for inviting 
conference speakers who are critical of the Catholic Church and have supported 
abortion rights, as well as the ordination of women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give my categorical and uncompromising support to the organizers," Mahony 
told the audience. "The overall good of this congress through the years is 
without question." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a dozen picketers distributed leaflets warning that the gathering 
could damage one's spiritual health, Mahony told delegates to smother the 
protesters with love. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cardinal supported Prendergast and Whitaker, Mahony withdrew a 
conference invitation two weeks ago to Daniel Maguire, a former priest and 
abortion rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, for reasons not disclosed, the Rev. John R. Aurelio of Buffalo, N.Y., 
was taken off the list of speakers after allegations surfaced that he molested 
two boys 15 to 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, delegates spent Friday listening to a host of workshop 
speakers in search of new material to incorporate into their church teachings 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming to something like this is a chance to get in touch with what's 
happening in the church as a whole and not just what's going on in your own 
little corner," said Douglas Clipperton, 43, who teaches adult Catholic classes 
in Mojave. "It's a good shot in the arm."

MARLA TRUMP'S EX-PUBLICIST TOLD TO WEAR ELECTRONIC BRACELET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marla Trump's former publicist was ordered Friday to wear an electronic 
bracelet while he appeals his conviction for burglarizing her home and stealing 
her shoes and underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Richard Andrias said he believes Chuck Jones "is a very troubled person" 
but disagreed with a prosecutor that he has violent tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to wearing the bracelet, Andrias ordered Jones to secure bond with 
the deed to his Greenwich, Conn., home, valued at about $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 52, was convicted Wednesday of burglary, possession of stolen property 
and weapon possession. He faces 1 1/2 years to 15 years in prison on the 
burglary count alone. Sentencing is set for April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic bracelet allows correction officials to monitor Jones' 
movements while he is under house arrest. The judge said he can leave home only 
to go to work or to attend to legal matters.

JACKSON BEING PERSECUTED, MINISTERS SAY; CELEBRITIES: REPRESENTATIVES OF SOME 
OF L.A.'S LARGEST BLACK CHURCHES DENOUNCE A 'PROSECUTION FRENZY' OF THE 
ENTERTAINER BY AUTHORITIES AND THE MEDIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jackson is being persecuted by police, prosecutors and the media, 
according to a group of ministers who called a news conference Friday to 
denounce what they called the "prosecution frenzy" surrounding the 
investigation of the world-renowned entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen ministers from some of Los Angeles' largest black churches 
joined in a statement suggesting that authorities are treating Jackson harshly 
because of his fame. The ministers also suggested that the news coverage has 
been unduly harsh in part because Jackson is black. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to think that it's not racially motivated," said William Epps, 
senior minister of the Second Baptist Church. "It does seem strange, however." 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference came as Jackson remains under scrutiny by Los Angeles and 
Santa Barbara prosecutors. A grand jury has been convened in Santa Barbara and 
has begun taking sworn testimony to determine whether Jackson should face 
criminal charges of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 That grand jury has taken testimony from several current and former employees, 
and sheriff's deputies are continuing to conduct an investigation. But neither 
Jackson nor the boy at the center of the case has yet been asked to testify, 
and there is some question as to whether the 14-year-old alleged victim will 
choose to take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, sex abuse victims cannot be compelled to testify against 
their will, a statute that Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has 
asked the Legislature to amend. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministers criticized Garcetti for that move, suggesting that it was 
motivated by a desire to persecute Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Garcetti is not new to the legal scene," the ministers said in their 
statement. "Where was his concern for alleged victims of sexual assault before 
Michael Jackson was accused? Does his degree of concern depend upon the status 
of the accused?" 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the news conference was devoted to the ministers' critique of the 
media coverage of the case, which has attracted international attention since 
last summer, when the allegations by the boy, who was then 13, became public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ministers did not single out news organizations for criticism, 
they said much of the coverage has insinuated that Jackson is guilty of child 
molestation. No charges have been filed against the entertainer, and a civil 
case brought against him by the boy was settled out of court for $15 million to 
$24 million, according to sources familiar with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Cecil L. Murray, pastor of the First African Methodist Episcopal 
Church, urged reporters to use caution in reporting the allegations against 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Curbside justice is no worse," Murray said, "than flashbulb justice."

ASSEMBLYMAN QUACKENBUSH JOINS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that his campaign will focus on obtaining lower insurance rates and 
greater competition between insurers to benefit consumers, Assemblyman Charles 
W. Quackenbush (R-Cupertino) has announced that he is running for state 
insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 A businessman who was first elected to the Assembly in 1986, Quackenbush, 39, 
said Thursday that he understands insurance problems because he and his wife 
started a temporary service that evolved into a consulting firm, a computer 
software company, and ultimately an engineering construction firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need an insurance commissioner who aggressively attacks the root causes of 
fewer insurance choices and stubbornly high insurance rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northern California legislator, who is vice chairman of the Revenue and 
Taxation Committee, recently introduced a bill calling for a "consumers bill of 
rights" designed to help consumers shop for insurance and resolve their 
disputes with insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the June Republican primary, Quackenbush will face Wes Bannister, the 1990 
nominee for state insurance commissioner, and Jim Conran, director of the state 
Department of Consumer Affairs.

DORNAN SAYS HE WILL SEEK 9TH -- AND FINAL -- TERM IN CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of apparent indecision, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) 
announced Friday that he will seek reelection to a ninth -- and final -- term 
in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement by the combative conservative that he will run again in 
central Orange County's 46th Congressional District means a postponement of his 
plans to seek higher office or begin a career as a talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dornan publicly had been coy about his political future, his plans 
were revealed in a fund-raising letter he sent to his supporters in which he 
underscored that this would be his "final race for Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask my supporters to ride with me one more time toward the thunder of the 
political battlefield," he said in a campaign statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the usual hoopla that accompanies campaign kickoffs, Dornan's 
announcement was low-key and limited to a two-page press release. Dornan was 
not available for comment, and his statement did not include his commitment to 
make this his last campaign for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dornan's press secretary, Brian Keeter, said the congressman strongly 
backs term limits and will honor his pledge to step down after the next term if 
he is reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Dornan said he is running again because he believes Congress 
"will be the primary battlefield" in the conservatives' fight against the 
Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not explain his rejection of other options he had considered, including 
a run for the GOP presidential nomination in 1996, going after the U.S. Senate 
seat held by Democrat Dianne Feinstein, or seeking a lucrative broadcasting 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear he waited until the last minute because this was the last thing he 
wanted to do," said Howard Adler, former chairman of the Orange County 
Democratic Party who heads Beat Bob Inc., a fund-raising committee organized 
last year to defeat Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does not want to represent the people of the 46th (district)," Adler said. 
"He has devoted all of his energy to finding another job. . . . I don't think 
he deserves to keep (the seat)."

ON SHAKY GROUND; COMMERCE: VENTURA BOULEVARD HAS BEEN THE ECONOMIC LIFELINE OF 
THE VALLEY. THE QUAKE DEALT IT ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF JOLTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The trembling of the ground has finally abated, but for shop owners up and 
down this once-busy stretch of Ventura Boulevard, business remains shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than the steady clang of cash registers, they hear the grinding of 
wrecking cranes outside their windows, knocking down office and apartment 
buildings rocked by the Northridge earthquake -- the ones that once created the 
clientele they fear may never be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than half of my business comes from a one-mile radius," said Michael 
Ourieff, owner of Michael J's restaurant. "And now they're gone, they're all 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake has been but the latest disaster to send shock waves along the 
once glitzy San Fernando Valley boulevard, which for years has seen its 
business base rocked by recession, where the "Grand Opening" signs of old have 
slowly been replaced by placards of a different sort: "Going Out of Business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the post-World War II consumer boom, the 17-mile-long commercial stretch 
has run across the Valley floor like an unabated river of retail, representing 
a healthy, buying, vibrant America. It was the Melrose Avenue of the San 
Fernando Valley, a sign that people north of the hill had their own economic, 
cultural and aesthetic centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent years have been hard on the boulevard, where vacancy rates have 
soared and discount stores have popped up in choice locations as rents 
plummeted to as low as $1.25 per square foot, roughly half what was being 
charged before the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as planners developed a vision for refurbishing the retail strip into the 
next century -- a plan to create more parking and pedestrian access to compete 
with nearby malls and other retail drags throughout the Valley -- business 
owners squabbled over how the plan's $222-million price tag would be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as their prized boulevard reels from earthquake damage, politicians, 
business owners and residents are more fearful than ever over the future of the 
traffic-choked thoroughfare known as the Valley's Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 And for good reason. Between Studio City and Woodland Hills, 384 properties 
along Ventura Boulevard suffered more than $41 million in earthquake damage, 
according to a city building and safety report. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sherman Oaks, more than 165 buildings along the boulevard were damaged by 
the temblor -- 19 of them deemed unsafe and another 30 confined to limited 
entry, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura Boulevard got a huge punch in the stomach -- it was knocked out, the 
smelling salts are being taken out all over the place," said Michael Lushing, 
vice president of CB Commercial, a commercial real estate firm. "But it's the 
heart of retail in the Valley -- it can't afford to be out." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reassure shaken businesses, U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. 
Brown took a half-hour tour of quake-beleaguered Ventura Boulevard recently, 
looking at buckled buildings and talking to owners about how they planned to 
bring customers back. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with 40 business owners, Brown promised that the Clinton 
Administration would do what it could to cut bureaucratic red tape and see that 
redevelopment money in the form of grants and loans was rushed to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many owners feel economically adrift, waiting for help they fear may 
never come. "Brown said all the right things," Ourieff said. "Now we just have 
to wait to see if they come true. But the clock is ticking away. A lot of 
people can't wait for the life preserver. They're going down too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at a time when a future vision is most badly needed, the floor has 
literally been pulled out from thousands of white-collar workers who have been 
uprooted by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than a million and a half square feet of commercial office tenants have 
been displaced -- 5% of the entire Valley market -- and another 500,000 square 
feet of small business space was damaged," said Bruce Frasco, senior vice 
president of Beitler Commercial Realty, whose business was forced to moved from 
its 10,000-square-foot Sherman Oaks headquarters into a space one-third the 
size in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 "These tenants are out on the street. And the problem is, for many, that their 
leases are still in effect," Frasco said. "In most cases, the landlord has up 
to a year to rebuild the premises and 90 days just to inform you what he is 
going to do -- tear down the building, or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, many landlords aren't willing to lease to businesses on a 
temporary basis until they can move back into their old haunts. So, people are 
literally out in the cold. They're stuck in limbo. Time has become a killer." 
</P>
<P>
 And many small businesspeople are faced with a conundrum: If they walk away 
from their shops, give them back to the banks, their employees will be back on 
the streets, out of work -- adding to the quake's economic blow to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting with Brown, a Bullock's vice president told him that his retail 
chain would lose $120 million in sales to the earthquake. More startling, he 
said, 300 employees had been laid off from the store's Sherman Oaks location 
and another 300 in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even before last month's temblor, the boulevard was at an economic 
crossroads, experts say -- one that has been made more critical by the recent 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Along one popular stretch between Beverly Glenn and Van Nuys boulevards, six 
of 18 shops sat empty at year's start. Now that blight has been joined by 
earthquake-related eyesores: Broken light poles and cracks in the street and 
plywood covering former window displays. 
</P>
<P>
 There are "Now Leasing" and "Available" signs everywhere on most every block, 
as well as ones that cry "Earthquake menus!" and "Earth-shattering sales!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Look around," said Brain, chairman of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan 
Review Board. "We've lost all the building blocks of a balanced community. 
Malls are damaged. Drugstores abandoned. The only hotel in Sherman Oaks has 
been declared unsafe. Grocery stores and multi-business office buildings -- all 
declared unsafe. A local church is holding Masses in a tent out back. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are wondering what this boulevard and this community are going to 
look like a year from now. Are there going to be deserted lots every other 
blocks? We're praying that doesn't come to pass." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one would dare venture that Ventura Boulevard might benefit from 
the quake, many planners see Brown's promises of financial support as the first 
ray of sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has prompted some merchants to take a closer look at the Ventura 
Boulevard Specific Plan, a broad planning blueprint that aims to upgrade the 
infrastructure of the boulevard and control what residents had complained was 
runaway growth. The estimated cost of the project had been $222 million. Much 
of those funds were to come through "trip fees" assessed to businesses, based 
on how much traffic they generated. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, business owners complained that the fees were too high 
and suggested that other funding sources, perhaps an assessment district, be 
explored. Brain and other merchants have asked the city Planning Commission to 
cut the price tag of the plan to $100 million. The panel agreed to consider the 
proposal.

CITYSCAPES / LAURA GALLOWAY: AFTER MIDNIGHT, WHEN GENERATION X TAKES OVER 
CANTER'S; 'IF YOU MEET A GUY AT CANTER'S, NO MATTER HOW STRANGE HE LOOKS, YOU 
KNOW THAT HE HAS MORALS.' 
</P>

<P>
 The flannel shirts are plentiful enough to rival any Midwestern truck stop at 
dawn. Combat boots shine, and pierced body parts are to nighttime patrons what 
mustard is to pastrami sandwiches. At booths and tables, customers flirt, 
klatch and catch up over coffee and knishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Canter's after midnight -- when old-time delicatessen patrons give 
way to Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
 Each weekend, Los Angeles' oldest and most venerated deli undergoes a 
metamorphosis that begins slowly at midnight and gains momentum as the late 
evening turns to early morning. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bars close, weary club-goers in their 20s and 30s come to fill up on 
food and get in a few final hours of schmoozing. After all, where else can one 
get a corned beef on rye, nurse a hangover and feel like part of a Fellini 
film? 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it," says one 25-year-old, clad in a baby-doll dress and oversized 
hat. "This place is where the strangest-looking people come." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mornings and afternoons, the deli is decidedly more staid. The eatery 
is filled with regulars, such as Martin Vimand, who have been coming for the 
food for years. Although he has been a Canter's customer for more than a 
quarter-century, he usually does not venture in after dark, and for good 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little old. I don't go for the real loud noise level. But I have been 
here as late as 10 o'clock," Vimand says over his lunch of chopped liver and 
pastrami. In fact, even the waitresses, known for their crisp pink uniforms and 
in-your-face attitudes, are younger in the late evenings. "(The older 
waitresses) couldn't handle the younger crowd," says Lynn Price, one of the day 
managers at Canter's. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger crowd is not easily categorized. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the grunges, clad in oversize flannel shirts and baggy jeans. There 
are the rockers, who prefer leather to plaid, and those who go undefined, 
including patrons with super-toned bodies and skintight clothing. If they don't 
come to be seen, they come to scam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come to look at the girls, and sometimes to look at the strange people," 
says Peter Corey, an aspiring screenwriter who had ordered a martini extra dry 
and a bowl of matzo ball soup. His friend, Bryce McDonald, a movie producer, 
agrees. "It's kind of like bird-watching," he says. "Except in this case, the 
later the better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Always, there is the chance for love. Once, says a female patron, a man with a 
Harley-Davidson jacket sent her a barrage of poems written on paper napkins. 
When she excused herself from the table to go reapply her lipstick, he followed 
her to the restroom. Phone numbers were exchanged and the pair dated for three 
months. "If you meet a guy at Canter's, no matter how strange he looks, you 
know that he has morals," she says knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Many attribute the success of the deli as an after-hours nightspot not only to 
the colorful clientele, but to the location on Fairfax Avenue, central to many 
clubs and bars that are in vogue. It doesn't hurt, either, that the eatery is 
open 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really relaxing. There's a very diverse crowd here," says a 24-year-old 
band manager who goes by the name Jenz. "We usually come from a club all the 
time because it's still open." Jenz, who has a streak of purple running through 
her raven hair, is clearly not here for the deli fare. The vegetarian has 
ordered coffee and a bowl of pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 Bella Haig, the night manager of the deli and a 30-year Canter's employee, 
says the influx of young people is nothing new. "I've been through the hippie 
generation, then the Hell's Angels, then the punkers. The lines have been so 
long that the windows used to break from people leaning on them," Haig says. It 
was around that time that private security guards had to be hired. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, potentially volatile situations are handled by Jack Baker, 
Canter's 83-year-old, one-man security force. Baker mostly patrols the booths, 
working on noise control and occasionally asking customers who sit cross-legged 
to put their feet on the floor. "It rips the vinyl, you know. Especially big 
high heels." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker has seen quite a lot of heels in his 48 years at Canter's. "You'll see 
guys dressed like girls, and they're good-looking!" he says incredulously. "In 
the old days, we had all the old people. Now you've got this young stuff coming 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the deli's nighttime patrons readily admit it is uncool to be 
star-struck, the frequent appearance of Hollywood notables has proved to be yet 
another draw. "All the Jewish comics come here," says McDonald, ticking off a 
list of sightings that could make a tabloid journalist salivate. 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians often take part in impromptu jam sessions in the Kibbitz Room, a bar 
that adjoins the deli and features live music by local bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tova Oppenheim, a hostess at Canter's, readily admits that all her 
idols are "in Palm Springs and semi-retired," she lights up when she mentions 
the fact that she has seen members of the rock group Guns N' Roses and cast 
members of the daytime soap "The Young and the Restless" in the deli.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here four glorious years," she says. "And the best thing about this 
place is really the people -- the variety of people."

PLAN OKD FOR CITY WORKERS TO OVERSEE QUAKE-RELATED DEMOLITION PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday won approval of a plan to have the 
demolition of hundreds of earthquake-damaged buildings managed by city workers 
instead of by private contractors who he said would charge twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's victory in a vote before the City Council represented a change in 
attitude for Riordan, the Republican who campaigned on a pledge to turn many 
government jobs over to private firms and called city bureaucrats "brain-dead." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, three liberal Democratic council members, who have been 
champions of municipal employees, criticized the city's Bureau of Engineering 
and said private contractors could do the job for less. They lost in a 10-3 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "This demonstrates my commitment to support the most cost-effective way to 
accomplish the public's work, whether we use public employees or private 
contractors, when appropriate," Riordan said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted to place 79 workers from the city's Bureau of 
Engineering into a new Earthquake Recovery Division, which will oversee 
demolition of up to 1,000 buildings. The public employees will award contracts 
to private firms that will raze the buildings and haul away debris. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bureau of Engineering estimated that city workers can do the job for $5.8 
million, compared to $12.3 million that three private partnerships would have 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer Robert Horii said the city can do the work for less because it 
has lower overhead costs and will not factor in a 10% profit margin like the 
private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Horii said the shift to city oversight became possible when the estimated 
number of buildings to be demolished dropped from 10,000 to a maximum of 1,000. 
Officials said they expect at least half to be demolished by owners or 
insurance companies, leaving 500 for the city to destroy. 
</P>
<P>
 With the scope of the work greatly reduced, Riordan Administration officials 
said the final stumbling block to public oversight was whether the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency would reimburse the city for its costs. Regulations 
had limited such payments to prevent cities from propping up city personnel 
costs with emergency funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan called federal budget Director Leon E. Panetta and wrote FEMA 
Director James L. Witt this week to ask for a waiver of regulations. Witt 
agreed to the waiver Thursday because of the projected savings of $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Richard Alatorre noted that city officials had estimated what 
the private contractors would charge instead of allowing the companies to 
submit bids. "Everything depends on us being able to do it cheaper and better," 
he said. "Let's test it. Let's see." 
</P>
<P>
 But his request to give the firms more time to present a counterproposal was 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 George Pla, owner of one of the companies considered for the work, said the 
private firms would have presented lower bids if they had been given a chance. 
"Since when, in the history of the world, does government do something cheaper 
than the private sector?" Pla asked in an interview. "I'd like to know if 
anyone can cite an example." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan had said earlier in the week in an appearance before the League of 
Women Voters that a proposal to have three private partnerships handle the 
oversight work was "a pork barrel" that would benefit "a lot of friends of 
politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan declined to identify the politicians or elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre has ties to four firms that were among about a dozen initially 
recommended for the lucrative contracts. Pla is a political ally and he once 
employed Alatorre's son. Another firm is headed by a former campaign manager 
and a third by a former Alatorre chief of staff. The fourth company supported 
the councilman politically. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre said his connections to the firms had nothing to do with his support 
of private contracting. He said he simply believed that the private companies 
could oversee the work more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 Only council members Richard Alarcon and Mike Hernandez voted with Alatorre 
against the public oversight proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon and Hernandez said they wanted to ensure that the work was done for 
the lowest cost. They also said private contractors would be more effective at 
recruiting minority-owned firms to do the demolition.

OFFICERS GOT GOOD REVIEWS AFTER ALLEGED INCIDENTS; LAPD: PERSONNEL RECORDS 
REVEAL SUPERVISORS GAVE THE TWO GLOWING EVALUATIONS AFTER ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY 
HARASSED FEMALE COLLEAGUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Los Angeles police officers at the center of a massive LAPD sexual 
harassment inquiry received glowing performance evaluations after incidents in 
which they allegedly mistreated female colleagues, copies of personnel records 
obtained by The Times reveal. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1993, Officer Jay A. Varga was given strong ratings in 22 of 28 
categories and was not found to need improvement in any area. The report called 
his work exemplary and credited him with enjoying the respect and trust of 
community leaders, including a homeowners association president and City 
Councilman Marvin Braude, whose district Varga patrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 But those laudatory reports stand in stark contrast to allegations that Varga 
and another officer, Stephen M. McNicholas, made sexist and racist remarks and 
failed to come to the aid of female officers who were in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a copy of the personnel complaint filed against them, Varga and 
McNicholas made sexist remarks on a number of occasions -- allegedly referring 
to a police car containing two female officers as a "bitch car." 
</P>
<P>
 The personnel complaint was completed Oct. 25, 1993, while the audit of the 
West Los Angeles station was under way. It details eight instances of allegedly 
improper comments or actions by McNicholas or Varga in 1990 and 1991. In one 
case, Varga allegedly told a female officer, Paget Mitchell, that "blacks are 
subhumans, blacks can't write and have no capability of learning, and I don't 
want to work with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Varga allegedly made that comment in early 1990. Mitchell also told 
investigators that Varga failed to come to her aid when she was battling a 
combative suspect at the West Los Angeles jail. Mitchell declined to comment on 
the investigation Friday, but she said the allegations in the report were true. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McNicholas also was accused of failing to assist a female officer as she 
struggled with a suspect in the back of a police car. Gary Fullerton, a 
director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which is backing the two 
officers, said the allegation was "totally false." 
</P>
<P>
 Another allegation against McNicholas accuses him of telling a female officer: 
"No white man would want to rape a black woman because they are too ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory G. Petersen, a lawyer who represents Varga and McNicholas, angrily 
rejected every one of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department has not provided me with any formal charges against my 
clients," Petersen said. "But the allegations, as described to me by (a 
reporter), are untrue, unfounded, unsubstantiated and grossly unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity between the comments attributed to the officers in the personnel 
complaint and their glowing performance evaluations bothered some observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe what this is showing is that we need a whole new way of evaluating 
officers," said City Councilwoman Laura Chick, a member of the Public Safety 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick and some other observers commended the LAPD for conducting a massive 
investigation into the sexual harassment allegations at the West Los Angeles 
station, a police division that has long been accused of allowing hostility 
toward women. The LAPD audit, which is nearly complete, took four months and 
involved interviews with more than 100 officers in West Los Angeles, according 
to sources familiar with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But leaders of the Police Protective League called a news conference Friday in 
which they criticized the department for its inquiry, accusing LAPD officials 
of slanting the investigation to bolster the charges against Varga and 
McNicholas. Danny L. Staggs, the league's president, also said that the union 
"resents the fact the 250 officers and supervisors (at West Los Angeles) have 
been branded" as tolerating an environment that is hostile to women. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Department observers and critics delivered sharply different 
assessments of the West Los Angeles station and its reputation as a difficult 
place for women to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Paulette Herman, a day watch commander at West Los Angeles and president 
of the Los Angeles Women Police Officers Assn., told City News Service that 
"believe me, if sexual harassment was going on at West L.A. right now, I would 
be very sensitive and aware of it, and it's just not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Herman was assigned to West Los Angeles after the investigation was under way. 
A source familiar with the LAPD internal investigation said harassment at the 
station has virtually stopped since the inquiry was launched last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Spillar, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation and a 
co-chairwoman of the Women's Advisory Council to the Police Commission, said 
West Los Angeles has earned its reputation as a hostile environment for female 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been so many complaints out of that division," Spillar said. "It's a 
cesspool." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how the LAPD investigation came to be initiated remains a mystery, as 
department officials say there was no specific complaint of misconduct. Police 
union leaders doubt that, and say the investigation was intended to build a 
case against Varga and McNicholas. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two officers were first transferred out of West Los Angeles last year, 
but they went to court to block the transfer. It was after they filed suit that 
the allegations of sexual harassment came to light, according to department 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen and leaders of the police union say the timing is no coincidence, but 
rather bolsters their contention that the LAPD was out to punish Varga and 
McNicholas. The officers echo that argument, and laid out their case in an Aug. 
9, 1993, letter to Deputy Mayor William Violante, a former police union 
president who serves in the Administration of Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 In that letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Times on Friday, Varga 
asked Violante to launch an inquiry into the department's efforts to transfer 
him and McNicholas. Varga requested that the investigation be handled by the 
civilian Police Commission because he doubted the integrity of LAPD management. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Varga said questions about him were first raised in early 1993 
after an officer at the West Los Angeles station reported "perceived 
mistreatment" to a supervisor. That officer's complaint ultimately sparked what 
Varga described as a "clandestine investigation" overseen by Deputy Chief 
Ronald A. Frankle. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Varga, that investigation involved interviews with about 40 
female officers, who were asked leading questions about officers and 
supervisors in the West Los Angeles police station. Varga said in his letter 
that commanders put together a hit list based on those interviews, and soon 
began transferring the officers on that list to other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But when commanders attempted to transfer Varga and McNicholas, they objected, 
saying they had a right to see any material that had been gathered against 
them. Commanders at first insisted there was not an administrative 
investigation under way, but later admitted that they had polled female staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the personnel complaint against Varga and McNicholas lists a number 
of charges against the officers, more may be brought against them or other 
officers, police sources said. The audit is nearly complete, and its results 
are being forwarded to the department's Internal Affairs Division, which will 
consider whether the allegations of misconduct warrant disciplinary hearings.

GUNMAN WHO SHOT POLICE OFFICERS TRIED TO JOIN LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY and JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David J. Fukuto, the gunman who shot two Palos Verdes Estates police officers 
to death this week, was so enraptured with the world of guns and law 
enforcement that he sought to become a Los Angeles police officer shortly after 
the 1992 riots, according to city personnel records and the account of a close 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he wanted to try to do some good," said the friend, who shared 
Fukuto's passion for guns and often went target shooting with him. "Everybody 
wants to take the bad guys off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuto, 32, who died in the still unexplained attack at a motivational seminar 
for Palos Verdes Estates police officers and city officials, passed the Los 
Angeles Police Department's written exam in June, 1992, and scored a 93 out of 
100 on the oral exam a month later, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuto's scores were considered outstanding, but the self-employed life 
insurance agent did not take subsequent tests or land a job because of a 
partial hiring freeze and a flood of applicants with Gulf War military 
experience, a city personnel department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's hiring rules, veterans of Operation Desert Storm are given a 
five-point bonus on the police oral exam, enabling some applicants to score 
above 100. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did very well, but it was kind of cutthroat," said Diana Britt, assistant 
chief of the department's Police and Fire Selection Division. "I doubt they 
hired anyone that year who scored under 98." 
</P>
<P>
 Britt said candidates -- particularly minority applicants, who are typically 
in high demand -- are encouraged to retake the oral exam every three months to 
improve their scores, but Fukuto -- who was Japanese American -- mysteriously 
dropped out and never tried again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lea Cherry, spokeswoman for the California Commission on Police Officer 
Standards and Training, which sets regulations for police agencies statewide, 
said there was no record that Fukuto had received any formal police training or 
had applied to other police departments, although she said the agency would 
know only about applications that resulted in official training. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hermosa Beach police officer, serving Friday as desk officer at the Palos 
Verdes Estates Police Department, said the department was consumed with funeral 
plans for the two slain officers and did not know if Fukuto had ever applied 
for a job there. A Palos Verdes Estates city employee, who asked not to be 
identified, said openings in the 23-member Police Department are rare and 
competition is intense. Last year, the employee said, the city was deluged with 
more than 300 applications for a civilian job in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the close friend who attends Fukuto's Mid-City Los Angeles 
church, Fukuto took the LAPD rejection "with a grain of salt" and never spoke 
of a grudge against law enforcement. The friend said being a cop "wasn't on the 
top of his agenda," but rather a visceral reaction to the lawlessness that 
followed the state verdicts in the Rodney G. King beating trial in the spring 
of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he talked of anything it was getting even with gangbangers or drug 
dealers, but not with cops," said the friend, who refused to be identified out 
of respect to Fukuto's family. "I think everyone has some sort of fantasy about 
being a cop and he probably did too, but I don't think he had an obsession." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Fukuto gradually had grown more concerned over the years about 
issues of personal safety and self-defense, once taking a course at El Camino 
College in defense tactics and later moving to the Mid-City home of his widowed 
grandmother out of fear for her safety in the sometimes dangerous neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Father John Yamazaki, pastor emeritus of St. Mary's Church, where Fukuto was a 
member of the board and was honored for his church service the night before the 
Torrance killings, said Fukuto went searching for his elderly grandmother after 
she wandered off to watch the looting during the riots. Friends said the riots 
convinced Fukuto that Los Angeles was a dangerous place to live, and that 
residents had to be responsible for their own well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 One source who asked not to be identified said the bulletproof vest Fukuto 
wore during the Monday attack had been loaned to him by a friend last year. The 
source said Fukuto feared that the federal verdicts in the King beating trial 
would lead to more rioting, and he wanted to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believed that guns were not evil, that it was the people behind them," one 
friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to friends and acquaintances, Fukuto had a longtime fascination with 
guns and law and order, something he made no attempt to hide. Police found an 
extensive gun and ammunition collection at Fukuto's home, including at least 13 
pistols, three rifles and two shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
 The close friend said Fukuto received his first rifle from his father, state 
District Court of Appeal Justice Morio Fukuto, who, in his only statement about 
the killings, described his son's actions as terrible and unforgivable and said 
he could offer no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just an adventurer type, a gun collector, a shooter," said one friend 
who grew up in Fukuto's childhood neighborhood in Torrance and played 
paint-ball war games with him in the early 1980s. "He was involved in street 
racing, and shooting and hunting. He was pretty well-liked." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper Rafu Shimpo, which serves the Japanese American community in Los 
Angeles, reported this week that Fukuto had an hourlong debate over gun control 
with an acquaintance last Sunday, the day before he killed Capt. Michael Tracy, 
50, and Sgt. Vernon Thomas Vanderpool, 57, on the 12th floor of the Torrance 
Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting an unidentified source, the newspaper said Fukuto insisted "we need 
guns to protect ourselves" and at times raised his voice during the debate. The 
newspaper also said an unidentified source saw Fukuto wearing a blue uniform 
shortly after graduating from North High School in Torrance. "I remember 
laughing at him in his blue uniform and black gloves. I think he was trying to 
be a cop," the newspaper quoted the source.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
COUNCIL LIFTS HIRING FREEZE ON 80 LIBRARY JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council lifted a hiring freeze on 80 library jobs Friday 
so the city's libraries can continue to stay open six days a week.  
</P>
<P>
 The hiring will also allow officials to maintain children's programs, homework 
centers, literacy tutoring and other essential services.Librarians, clerks and 
support workers will be hired, but 25 other positions will remain unfilled. 
Most city agencies have been operating under a hiring freeze for three years as 
a budget-cutting measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously and without comment to authorize the new hiring, 
despite City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie's recommendation not to 
approve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other departments, the library system has absorbed funding cuts in recent 
years, including a 25% reduction in its budget for new books and materials. 
Mayor Richard Riordan wants increased private donations and use of volunteers 
to fill the gap.

 Trojangate (cont'd.): It's no shock that just-resigned Assemblyman Pat Nolan, 
who struck a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to a political corruption 
charge, attended USC. After all, the school has a long history of what 
euphemistically might be called hard-nosed politics, producing such famous 
names as Watergate figures H.R. Haldeman, Dwight L. Chapin, Ronald Ziegler and 
Donald H. Segretti. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, USC politics has been marked by such dirty tricks as the 
secret taping of opponents' conversations, the sprinkling of manure around 
polling places, the theft of school newspapers containing election endorsements 
and ballot box stuffing that caused one election to be invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Student Supreme Court has entered into the spirit of the high jinks, 
once convening secret sessions in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest you think that no white hats practiced politics at USC we should point 
out that another grad is county Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow we find it reassuring that Garcetti was defeated when he ran for 
student body president.

 Memories of a tarnished diamond: Caltrans' announcement that it may implement 
a permanent diamond lane when Santa Monica Freeway II opens may stir 
nightmarish memories for natives of L.A. (By natives, we mean anyone who has 
lived here 20 years or seen the movie "To Live and Die in L.A.") 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans tried it once before in the mid-1970s and the result was huge traffic 
jams, many caused by drivers entering the freeway and trying to move over to 
the car-pool lane. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there were disputes over whether it was fair to count kids as 
passengers. (Everyone agreed that the guy transporting mannequins was in the 
wrong.) 
</P>
<P>
 But a high school classmate of ours has pleasant memories of that brief 
experiment. He would stand near an off-ramp in West L.A. each morning and offer 
to ride with solo motorists for $20. 
</P>
<P>
 When people asked him what he did for a living, he would respond: "I'm in the 
diamond business."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 2 
TEEN-AGERS CHARGED IN SLAYING OF WOMAN, 69 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors filed murder charges Friday against two teen-agers accused of 
shooting a 69-year-old woman in the face when she refused to give up her purse. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty.Sandra Flannery said she will seek to try the 16- and 
17-year-old defendants as adults for the slaying of Amalia Camlas Sison, who 
died Thursday of injuries suffered during the Monday morning attack at a 
Windsor Hills bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, whose names were not released because of their ages, are scheduled 
to be arraigned Tuesday in Inglewood Juvenile Court on murder and robbery 
charges, said district attorney's spokeswoman Suzanne Childs.  
</P>
<P>
 Sison, a volunteer for the Foundation for the Junior Blind, was waiting for 
one of three buses that took her to and from the foundation's campus when the 
11:30 a.m. attack occurred at 54th Street and Alviso Avenue. The location is 
within view of the foundation's 5300 Angeles Vista Boulevard campus. 
Prosecutors allege the older youth fired the shot that hit Sison in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services for Sison were pending, a spokeswoman for the foundation 
said.

A BATTLE FOR RIGHTS; FILIPINO VETERANS OF WWII FIGHT FOR CITIZENSHIP, PENSIONS 
DESPITE MISSING ARMY RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 50 years after fighting on behalf of the United States during World War 
II, Filipino native Estanislao Bargas Beloy, 72, thought he was finally about 
to win his long battle for American citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when the retired Manila dentist arrived in Los Angeles to take 
advantage of a 1990 immigration law extending citizenship rights to Filipino 
World War II veterans, he ran into a brick wall -- namely, that the U.S. Army 
had no record on file of his service with a guerrilla artillery unit near 
Luzon. 
</P>
<P>
 Beloy, one of thousands of Filipino veterans whose military papers were 
apparently destroyed or lost during or after the Japanese occupation of what 
was then a U.S. colony, was among more than 300 Filipino World War II soldiers 
attending a prayer and protest vigil Friday outside the Federal Building in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The elderly veterans, most of whom have become American citizens as a result 
of the 1990 law, were demanding pension and disability benefits equal to those 
granted American war veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fought side by side with the Americans," said Los Angeles resident David 
Sarbilla. "We want equal benefits too." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired U.S. Army Col. Edwin Ramsey, who led World War II guerrilla forces in 
central Luzon, called the lack of benefits reprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for the loyalty and patriotic support 
of the Filipinos during World War II," said Ramsey, a speaker at the rally. 
"The tragedy is that Americans don't appreciate that before the war there were 
18 million Filipinos and after the war there were 17 million. Most would not 
have died if they had accepted the Japanese and turned against the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The morning protest coincided with the anniversary of a 1946 federal act that 
rescinded the rights of Filipinos who fought alongside American soldiers. In 
1941, then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an order incorporating the 
Philippine armed forces into the U.S. military and pledging citizenship to 
Filipinos who took up arms against the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) recently reported that fewer than half 
of the estimated 60,000 veterans who were expected to file for naturalization 
since passage of the 1990 law have actually applied. Pelosi has introduced 
federal legislation to allow Filipinos to use military service records 
authenticated by the Philippine government since many American records were 
lost or later destroyed in a fire at the U.S. processing center. 
</P>
<P>
 Although federal judges have ruled in favor of veterans with substitute papers 
in several court cases, federal Immigration and Naturalization Service 
officials, fearing the potential of fraud, have appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The INS is simply required by law to (only) accept certification by the U.S. 
Army," said Joe Korvisky, a Department of Justice spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Filipino war veterans granted citizenship qualify for Social Security and 
health benefits and can also bring their families to the United States 
permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill sponsored by Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) also would extend full 
U.S. military pension and disability benefits to all Filipino World War II 
veterans, a measure that analysts have said would result in a $1-billion-plus 
annual price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, Filipinos are generally entitled to limited service-connected 
disability compensation, life insurance, burial plots and burial flags, 
according to the Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington. They do not 
qualify for pensions, non-service-connected hospitalization or outpatient 
treatment, or a headstone for their graves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That is just not fair to the nearly 700,000 people of Filipino origin in 
California, protesters contend. There are more Filipinos in the state than in 
any other area outside the Pacific Ocean archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought in Bataan, I fought in Corregidor; we surrendered under Gen. 
(Jonathan) Wainwright," said Ceferino Carino, 77, who traveled to the rally 
from San Diego, where his three sons serve in the U.S. Navy. "I've been 
interviewed for citizenship, I've done everything." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carino, who holds a permanent immigrant visa, said he has yet to receive a 
ruling since his name is not on record at the Army's records center in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Beloy, who hopes to bring his two children to Long Beach from Saudi Arabia 
where they work as dentists, has hired a lawyer to help prove his claim of 
military service by using Philippine Army records. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never lost hope," said the lanky, freckled septuagenarian, who was 
wearing a white-and-yellow baseball cap. "I just keep on waiting because I am 
hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if the INS says no, I will feel disgusted," he added.

AL MARTINEZ: LIFE ON PLANET FANTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have a friend who sits on a hilltop at night, closes her eyes and attempts 
to make contact with unidentified flying objects through mental telepathy. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a sweet lady who told me about this after we attended a secret meeting 
of a private organization called the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial 
Intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 As I understand it, she has not made contact yet but believes that someday she 
will. It is part of a CSEI project called coherent thought sequencing, in which 
meditation is employed to facilitate getting in touch with whoever is out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 I say the meeting was secret because the organization's leader, Dr. Steven 
Greer, an emergency room physician from North Carolina, doesn't think the world 
is ready to know what he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows, for instance, that extraterrestrials are prepared to meet with us, 
that Washington is hiding the bodies of E.T.s killed in a crash and that CSEI 
needs $7 million in donations to continue making friends with the folks from 
Alpha Centauri. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need your love and we need your money," is the way the wife of folk singer 
Burl Ives put it. Ives and actor Eddie Albert were celebrities-in-attendance at 
the meeting, though I'm certain there are many more who belong to CSEI. Actors 
dwell in outer space most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The lady-who-sits-on-a-hilltop invited me to the session and at first asked me 
to sign a non-disclosure form. I said I wouldn't, so she said what the hey, 
come anyhow. I doubt if the woman has ever said hell in her life, though she 
probably wishes now I would go there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was held on Planet Earth at the Portofino Hotel in Redondo Beach. 
About 150 true believers gathered to hear Greer and others discuss the 
extraterrestrials they have seen or heard about. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer founded CSEI four years ago and claims 600 members. Its headquarters are 
in Asheville, N.C., where a lot of good old boys have no doubt had close 
encounters of many kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of the session, slides and home videotapes were shown to 
prove the existence of people from outer space who are visiting this planet. 
</P>
<P>
 They are pictures you have seen before on "Unsolved Mysteries" and "In Search 
Of . . . ": scratches of illumination across distant horizons, and blobs of 
light or shadow that hover in the sky like irregularities on outdated film. 
</P>
<P>
 The most unique photograph was that of a light blob over a man feeding beer to 
his horse in Colorado, although there was no indication that either the man or 
the horse were aware of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the audience were so moved by the blobs they applauded. At first it 
appeared that at least three people had either died or fainted from the 
excitement, but it became clear later that they had simply dozed off. 
</P>
<P>
 By Greer's estimate, there have been hundreds of close encounters with UFOs 
and extraterrestrials since 1947. Then why, I hear you ask, hasn't anyone taken 
pictures of the incidents, other than those photos of distant blobs? 
</P>
<P>
 It is because, Greer explained, cameras mysteriously fail to operate up close 
to aliens and their spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A psychologist, a former NASA scientist and a man who created his own think 
tank were among the, well, experts who believe we are about to shake hands or 
claws or other forms of protuberances with space aliens and ought to prepare 
for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 If the presence of these experts was meant to establish credibility, it failed 
as far as I'm concerned. Forty years as a journalist teaches you can gather 
scientists to swear they've seen fairies dancing on the lawn if there's enough 
money or glory in it. Some even believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 The "secret" part of the meeting, by the way, involved something called 
"Project Starlight," which included a timetable for contacting first the 
extraterrestrials and then CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 "From now on, please don't talk about what you see or hear," Greer said, after 
which he announced that $7 million would be necessary to finance "Project 
Starlight" and that it might include a rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, OK. I think there's probably something out there all right. It ain't 
swamp gas. I mean, Ives' wife, Dolores, was bathed once in a warming beam of 
light she calls her cosmic angel, and others have dined with E.T.s on tasty 
portions of tinted air. How can I not believe? 
</P>
<P>
 But if I were the lady-who-sits-on-a-hilltop, I wouldn't donate my estate to 
any organization that either believes the end of the world is near or the day 
of extraterrestrial contact is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus and E.T. may be coming, but they're not going to demand entrance fees or 
a table of organization to let us know about it.

LEAD TO LUNCHTIME BRAWL AT PARAMOUNT HIGH. A FEW MINOR INJURIES ARE REPORTED.

<P>
 A week of mounting racial tensions between blacks and Latinos at Paramount 
High School erupted into a lunch-period melee involving hundreds of students 
Friday, sheriff's deputies and school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few minor injuries were reported, and there were no immediate arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of sheriff's deputies helped school staff get students back into their 
classrooms, where they were held until they could be escorted off campus. About 
1,000 refused to leave, however, keeping the deputies on campus until about 
4:40 p.m., according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman 
Angie McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of parents, alerted by the commotion and a sheriff's helicopter 
circling above the 3,100-student campus on South Downey Avenue, flocked to the 
high school and the elementary campus across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Elseia Uhleirra arrived to pick up her daughter, Martha, a ninth-grader. "My 
daughter said there is a lot of racial tension here," Uhleirra said. "She said 
things have been getting really bad this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Unified School District officials confirmed there had been tensions 
between the high school's 2,300 Latino students and its 500 black students this 
week but said Friday's brawl involved far fewer students -- perhaps 30 to 50 in 
the initial fight. 
</P>
<P>
 A large crowd formed around the melee, and deputies were called when the 
students would not disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said no weapons were involved. Students will be interviewed 
when classes resume Tuesday to determine whether there will be any suspensions, 
district spokeswoman Norma Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Bruce Cantley, who assumed the post two weeks ago, referred all 
questions to the district office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz said tensions between the two groups had been building since midweek and 
extra administrators were sent to the high school Friday morning. One student 
said there was a fight Tuesday or Wednesday when a Latino grabbed a necklace 
from a black student. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's melee began near the end of the lunch period, when someone pulled a 
fire alarm and a group of students turned over a couple of trash cans, Ortiz 
said. Others then started running around the campus and refused to go back to 
their classrooms. It was then that sheriff's deputies were called, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sophomore identified only as Juan watched much of the melee from his biology 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were just throwing trash cans and just standing around," he said. "I 
could hardly get to my classroom. But nobody was really fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has several efforts under way to promote racial harmony, 
including multicultural activities. Ortiz said there had been no serious 
incidents until Friday, but some students said tensions had been high for quite 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
 With Friday's brawl, Paramount joined a growing list of Los Angeles-area 
schools that have faced racial fights and other problems recently. In November, 
police were called to Pomona High School to help quell several fights, a day 
after nine were arrested in fights at Jordan High School in Long Beach.

CONGREGATIONS JOIN RISING CHORUS IN CALL FOR UPDATED MUSIC; HYMNS: 'WHY DO WE 
INSIST THAT NORTH AMERICAN WORSHIP BE 19TH-CENTURY NORTHERN EUROPEAN?,' ONE 
CHURCH OFFICIAL ASKS.

 Roll over, Handel. Take a step back, John Wesley. Make room in the choir for 
Hank and Dolly and Whoopi. 
</P>
<P>
 In the world of church music, where it is difficult for living composers to 
break into denominational hymnals, a growing chorus of voices is being raised 
for incorporating contemporary music into worship. 
</P>
<P>
 United Methodist scholar Tex Sample, in a speech last month at Emory 
University's Candler School of Theology, said country music is the soul music 
of millions of working-class people and should find its place in liturgies that 
reflect the lives of people in the pews. 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Francis of Assisi Episcopal Church in Novato, Calif., anything from 
reggae music to a selection from the musical "Les Miserables" may be heard in 
the Sunday family service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do we insist that North American worship be 19th-Century Northern 
European? What if we were to use some authentic trappings of American culture?" 
the Rev. Philip Lyon Rountree Jr., the church rector, asked in an article last 
year in the periodical Congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of contemporary music say most church music, even such hymns as "A 
Mighty Fortress Is Our God," had their origins as folk songs. If you want to 
reach today's audiences with a religious message, this generation should be 
given the same freedom to adapt contemporary music to liturgical uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory works well in the movies. In "Sister Act," neighborhood people 
flocked in off the streets after the character played by Whoopi Goldberg livens 
up the music at the Catholic church she is hiding out in. 
</P>
<P>
 Even critics agree that church music should not be entirely other-worldly. 
What they insist, however, is that music directors choose the finest of the 
liturgical tradition, not rush out to perform Billy Ray Cyrus' "Achy Breaky 
Heart" in the processional because it is at the top of the charts that week. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to take the best and the most noble in a culture, and just not go to 
the least common denominator," said Thomas Day, author of "Why Catholics Can't 
Sing." 
</P>
<P>
 Day, chairman of the music department at Salve Regina College in Newport, 
R.I., sees in the rush to contemporary music "a hidden agenda" that has more to 
do with the "tremendous egos" of clergy and soloists than liturgical reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In traditional worship settings, with the organ playing and the congregation 
singing, the song is a form of communal worship that plays an important part in 
the service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, when they're up there singing 'On Eagle's Wings' or even a nice song 
like 'Amazing Grace,' there's always someone up there with the spotlight on 
them and to hell with the congregation," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 But proponents of contemporary music say it is the traditionalists who have 
turned a deaf ear to the pews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a question of giving up 'the word,' if you will. It's a question of 
'the word' being indigenous," Sample said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as religious leaders can find valuable teaching material in biblical 
accounts of killing, lying and adultery, so can they find "great grist for the 
mill" in country music amid the contradictions of suffering and redemption, 
hope and hopelessness, Sample said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, Johnny Paycheck's "Take This Job and Shove It" talks 
about the suffering of people who keep jobs they hate in order to pay the 
bills. Kris Kristofferson's "Sunday Morning Coming Down" speaks about the need 
to have enough meaning in one's life to make it through the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfaction does not come through a job or casual sexual relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes love pretty important," Sample said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Episcopal Church near San Francisco, Rountree found one reason young 
people were not regular churchgoers was that they considered church music 
morose and depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rountree observed that there was something amiss in efforts to attract 
worshipers in California with services dependent on British culture and several 
centuries of Northern European organ music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, the people were simply not coming to church, or they would come 
once," he said. "I began to think, 'What's more important here, preserving the 
culture or giving people access to the Gospel?"' 
</P>
<P>
 The church added a third service on Sundays featuring contemporary music from 
folk, contemporary Christian, gospel music and other sources, including some 
traditional hymns. Within six months, he said, the service was full or nearly 
full every Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 When he started the service in 1987, the service was considered a daring 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years later, he said, "it's very much like their traditional religion 
right now."

COURT BECOMES ARBITER IN CLASH BETWEEN SEXUAL REVOLUTION, RELIGION; 
DISCRIMINATION LAWS: BROTHERS CITE THEIR BELIEFS IN DEFENDING REFUSAL TO RENT 
TO UNMARRIED COUPLE. 
</P>

<P>
 A high court in Massachusetts has become an arbiter in a culture clash pitting 
religion against the sexual revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that bears resemblance to others around the country, two Catholic 
brothers are facing charges of discrimination because they refused to rent an 
apartment to an unmarried couple. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers say they were following their religious beliefs, but the state 
says their rental business doesn't qualify as a religious activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Catholicism is not on trial here, but (the brothers') strongly held religious 
convictions are," said Jay Sekulow, counsel for the American Center for Law and 
Justice, a Virginia group founded by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which is representing the landlords, Paul and Ronald Desilets, 
presented arguments last week before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikolas Nikas, another attorney with the Virginia group, said the landlords 
were justified in refusing to go against their religion. He also noted that 
fornication is still against the law in Massachusetts, although authorities say 
it is rarely, if ever, enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commonwealth is attempting to force the Desilets to violate their 
sincerely held religious beliefs," Nikas said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judith Beals, an assistant attorney general, said the landlords are 
engaged in a commercial activity, not a form of worship that is protected under 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The landlords have not shown how the government has restrained them in their 
religious worship," Beals told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar cases have arisen in other states. In 1990, the Minnesota Supreme 
Court ruled in favor of a landlord who also refused to rent to an unmarried 
couple because of his religious beliefs. In California, the state Court of 
Appeal sided with a landlord, but the state Supreme Court last year refused to 
make a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wisconsin last year, a state judge ruled that a woman violated open housing 
laws by placing an ad for a "Christian handyman" to rent a room in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Such cases evoke different views of how far religious liberties should extend. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne-Marie Amiel, an attorney with the Rutherford Institute, an organization 
that specializes in religious civil liberties, said that if people rent out 
rooms in their homes, "they should be allowed to choose who they want under 
their own roof." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said that if someone owns a string of rental properties, "you are 
basically a commercial landlord. The (fair housing) laws apply to you." 
</P>
<P>
 A federal law passed last year, called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 
prevents any form of government from interfering with a person's exercise of 
religious freedom unless it can show a "compelling" interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some religious groups say the law bolsters the case of landlords such as the 
Desilets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the government has a legitimate interest in ensuring open housing, it 
has a variety of tools to achieve that goal without having to "run roughshod 
over the religious liberties of others," said Brent Walker, general counsel for 
the Baptist Joint Committee, which focuses on religious liberty issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts sided against the landlords in the 
case now before the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We care a lot about free exercise of religion," said Sarah Wunsch, an 
attorney with the organization. "What the landlords want goes way beyond what 
anyone considers free exercise of religion." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she said a small community where most residents share the same 
religious beliefs could essentially screen the people who live in the local 
rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Massachusetts, the state sued the Desilets after they turned away a young 
couple in 1989 from an apartment in the small western Massachusetts town of 
Turners Falls. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, Mark Lattanzi and Cynthia Tarail, had seen the apartment 
advertised in a newspaper. But Paul Desilets asked Tarail whether the couple 
planned to get married, and when she said no, he turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court papers, Desilets told Tarail: "I don't go for that living 
in sin stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 A Franklin County Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the landlords in 
1992, citing their religious rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Beals charged that the brothers violated the state's fair housing law, which 
prohibits discrimination based on marital status. She said that law recognizes 
the rights of unmarried couples, despite the statute against fornication.

IMPORTANCE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS GROWS AS AMERICANS AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE H. GALLUP JR. and ROBERT BEZILLA, Princeton Religion Research Center 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As we grow older, our energy, sex drive, memory, income, health and physical 
senses usually enter a state of gradual decline. But religious belief -- and 
the comfort and happiness it provides -- increases with age for most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some religious organizations even formalize the process of leadership by their 
older members by giving them the title "elders," and for good reason: As people 
mature, more often than not, they attach more importance to religion and step 
up their participation in the affairs of organized church life at all levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the young in this country, belief levels are high, with nearly all 
people believing in God or a universal spirit. But such beliefs are not always 
translated into actions until later in life, as the sense of identity with 
organized religion increases and the focus upon God in this life and the life 
hereafter becomes sharper. 
</P>
<P>
 As Americans grow older, they make firmer choices in religious preference, 
attend religious activities more often, and think more about how they have led 
their lives. For nearly every dimension of religious life we have surveyed over 
the years, an increase generally is found as people mature. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall sense of the importance of religion clearly increases as people 
grow older. More than two in three (69%) 50- to 64-year-olds say religion is 
very important in their lives, and three of every four people 65 and older feel 
this way.  
</P>
<P>
 Only 8% of the population maintain through their senior years that religion is 
unimportant in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 These feelings of importance are not just a state of mind but usually are 
translated into increased involvement in religious affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three in four of those ages 50 to 64 claim membership in a religious 
organization such as a church or synagogue (74%), and membership rises to 80% 
of the people 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, 44% of people ages 50 to 64 attend worship services in a given 
week, and participation rises to more than half (52%) among those 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, among adults under age 30, just 59% report religious group 
membership and 32% say they attend worship services during a given week. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons we do not understand, there is a tendency for seniors to gravitate 
toward Protestant denominations, while the Roman Catholic faith progressively 
loses its older members. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years we have found that three in 10 young adults and a similar 
proportion of teen-agers say they are Roman Catholic by preference. But this 
figure erodes as they grow older. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, just 23% of those ages 50 to 64 and 20% of those 65 and older said 
they are Catholics, compared with 30% of those 30 and younger. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Protestant churches include 45% of all churchgoers under age 
30, more than half of adults 30 to 49, and two in three of those 50 and older.  
</P>
<P>
 Given the higher proportion of older adults who are Protestants, it is not 
surprising to find that people older than 50 describe themselves as "born 
again" or evangelical Christians increasingly as they age. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1988 survey conducted by Gallup for the Los Angeles Times, the belief 
that "we will all be called before God at the judgment day to answer for our 
sins" increased with age. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those under 30, only 45% expect to be called to judgment, but this 
increases to 50% among those 30 to 49, and to 60% by age 50. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1990 Gallup Poll found, however, that as people grow older there also is a 
tendency to believe less in heaven and hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the age of 16, most people (93%) believe in heaven, but by age 50 just 
74% do.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, 76% of younger teen-agers think there is a hell, but that belief is 
sustained by just 54% of those 50 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 Among senior citizens still believing in heaven, 76% rate their own chances of 
going there as excellent or good. Among believers in hell, only 5% fully expect 
to be there when judgment day arrives.

 What does it mean to live a spiritual life in modern times? Naoshwerwan Anzar, 
a writer, publisher and follower of Meher Baba, will ponder the question in a 
keynote address next Saturday at Occidental College's Herrick Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 His speech is part of a two-day celebration at Occidental of the 100th 
anniversary of the birth of the Indian spiritual master. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Avatar Meher Baba Center of Southern California and 
Occidental's HerrickChapel and Interfaith Center, the festivities -- to be held 
from noon to 10 p.m. Friday and from 1 to 10 p.m. next Saturday -- will include 
music, films and skits. Anzar will speak at 4 p.m. next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kerze, who teaches religion and science at Occidental and directs 
Herrick Chapel, said Baba devotees "are a part of the wonderful religious 
variety here in Southern California. I thought it would be good for our 
students to be exposed to one of the significant religious figures of our 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Merwan S. Irani on Feb. 25, 1894 in Poona, India, the Avatar, or Divine 
Incarnation, said his identity as God in human form was unveiled to him through 
a meeting with an old Muslim holy woman. The appellation Meher Baba, which 
means "compassionate father," was given him by his mandali , or "close ones," 
who were of many different castes and creeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Anzar, who has published Glow International, a magazine devoted to Baba, since 
1966, knew the leader when he lived in Anzar's hometown of Dehra Dun, India. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several of his close ones, including my father, were sent to bring lepers and 
other suffering people to him," Anzar said. "He would wash their feet, clothe 
them and send them on their way" transformed by the love they experienced in 
his presence, he recalled. Anzar said he has felt Baba's powerful presence on a 
number of occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Baba said that God takes human form every 700 to 1,400 years to spread the 
word of love, and that he had come to earth to awaken mankind to the universal 
spiritual messages given by such previous avatars as Buddha, Rama, Krishna, 
Mohammed and Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 The spiritualist, who "dropped his body," as his followers say, on Jan. 31, 
1969, wanted no religion created in his name but rather to emphasize the 
oneness of all religions. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Linda Zavala, chairwoman of the centennial event, "He came to 
awaken the love and divine intuition within each person through intimate 
contact, rather than teaching, as gurus do." 
</P>
<P>
 A celebratory dinner will be held at 5:30 p.m. next Saturday. Reservations are 
$10. All other events are free. For information, contact the Avatar Meher Baba

BRIDGE RETROFIT DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Swift Freeway Retrofits Urged" (Feb. 2) and "Public Safety Must Never Take a 
Back Seat" (editorial, Feb. 6) suggested that the court dispute between 
Caltrans and the union representing its engineers is to blame for the delay in 
retrofitting freeway structures. 
</P>
<P>
 We are saddened that top Caltrans officials would choose a time like this to 
try to blame their workers for delays in retrofitting freeway structures while 
Caltrans engineers are working feverishly in overseeing the clearing away of 
debris as well as preparing plans and contracts for repair of the damaged 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 What the public is not being told is that last year the legislative analyst, 
noting that the seismic retrofit program was more that one year behind the 
schedule established by the Legislature, was particularly critical of Gov. Pete 
Wilson for his proposed budget, which "siphons transportation funds" from the 
seismic safety retrofit account to the general fund in order to balance the 
state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The court battle between Caltrans and its engineers did nothing to "siphon" 
funds from the retrofit account or delay its implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 We do want to assure all local residents that the engineers in the Los Angeles 
Caltrans district office are working diligently and speedily to repair damages 
and complete the retrofit repairs. We are proud of Caltrans. We want the public 
to be proud of us too.

YELTSIN MAKES A MOVE: FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE?; WHATEVER, THE WEST MUST SEIZE THE 
OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sarajevo artillery crisis is becoming the Cuban missile crisis of the 
1990s. NATO has sworn that air strikes will follow if the Serb heavy artillery 
ringing the Bosnian capital is not removed by midnight Sunday and has backed up 
its words with the largest military preparations seen anywhere since the Gulf 
War. Meanwhile, Russia's special envoy to Sarajevo has sworn that such air 
strikes will lead to "all-out war," while back in Moscow President Boris N. 
Yeltsin's principal rival, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, has spoken of "World War III." 
</P>
<P>
 ENTER THE RUSSIANS: Uninvited, Russia has pledge 400 troops for Sarajevo. The 
United States has a leased naval base in Albania and 300 troops, not part of 
the NATO operation, in Macedonia. One Bosnian Serb military leader has sworn 
that if air strikes occur, all foreigners will be taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials have nervously welcomed the Russian move, which clearly caught 
them by surprise, and hopefully (or fearfully) reported Serb compliance with 
the ultimatum. But Secretary of State Warren Christopher sees only partial 
compliance, and Sarajevan Muslims fear a bluff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians may indeed be bluffing, but a more hopeful reading of the 
radically ambivalent Russian move is that Yeltsin, unable to bluff NATO, has 
decided -- with a suddenness that might be unbelievable in anyone except this 
most mercurial of leaders -- to join NATO in a South Slav police action. Like 
the Russians themselves, all of the combatants in the Balkans War are Slavs, 
but religion binds the Russians to the Eastern Orthodox Serbs and divides them 
from the Roman Catholic Croatians as well as from the religiously mixed but 
substantially Muslim Bosnians. In 19th and early 20th-Century Great Power 
struggles, Serbia sided with Russia, Croatia with Austro-Hungary, Bosnia with 
Turkey. Serbia remains a potent symbol for Yeltsin's hyper-nationalistic foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just possibly, Yeltsin has found a way to play the Serbian card his own way. 
If he can be seen at home to have rescued the Serbs from NATO, then even if he 
has also checked the Serbs' expansionistic adventure, he will have foiled 
Zhirinovsky. If he is willing to replicate the Sarajevo solution, placing a 
Russian cordon sanitaire around other besieged Bosnian towns, he will be hailed 
as a savior. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin may have realized how a Serbian victory could hurt him. The proposed 
partition of Bosnia would not just reward Serbian aggression, after all, but 
also inspire Russian neo-fascism. Zhirinovsky, Yeltsin's foe, is the Russian 
equivalent of Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's neo-fascist president. Zhirinovsky 
wants to defend the ethnic Russians in Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic states 
by uniting them in a Greater Russia just as Milosevic has sought to unite the 
ethnic Serbs in Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia. The trick, for Yeltsin, is to 
show that he can defend those ethnic Russians without being drawn into actions 
that would drag Russia down as surely as Milosevic's actions have dragged 
Serbia down. The defense of the Serbs may be just the needed demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 EXIT WITH PEACE?: But the implications are broader still. If NATO and Russia 
can stand together as a tacit alliance against ethnic aggression anywhere 
between the Atlantic and the Urals, no European ethnic group would benefit from 
this protection more than the scattered Russians themselves. The wars that may 
be averted elsewhere as East and West together impose peace in the Balkans are 
wars that Russians might otherwise have to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Muslims, understandably, are ready to see nothing more in the 
arrival of Russian ground troops than the reinforcement of the Serbs now that 
the Serbs are on the defensive. They may well be right, but this moment of 
rapidly growing peril is also one of unparalleled opportunity. Yeltsin and the 
NATO leaders, including President Clinton, must help one another to seize it.

THE STING OF SACRAMENTO; BRILLIANT FBI WORK SHOWS THE UNDERBELLY OF CORRUPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another one bites the political dust in Sacramento -- and the dust is still 
stirring. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), in a deal struck with federal prosecutors, 
pleaded guilty to political corruption and has resigned.It's the end to another 
chapter in a continuing, disgusting saga of government for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Republican Assembly leader agreed to enter a guilty plea to one 
racketeering count in exchange for a sentence of two years in prison and nine 
months in a halfway house. He thus avoided a trial on six criminal counts for 
which he could have expected a six-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week lobbyist Clayton R. Jackson was convicted of corruption and 
given a 6 1/2-year sentence. Jackson's co-defendant, disgraced former state 
Sen. Paul Carpenter, also was convicted but fled the country and is a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 All were swept up in the FBI's eight-year investigation of corruption in 
Sacramento, in which agents offered money in return for official action. The 
sting has led to the conviction or indictment of a dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI, to its credit, has relentlessly pursued the investigation, which has 
illuminated the dangerously cozy relationships between legislators and 
lobbyists in the state capital. Are lobbyists indeed the unelected arm of 
government in Sacramento? The investigation sadly demonstrates that too often 
legislating doesn't quite work the way it's described in the civics books.

TO THE MCA STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For months now, MCA Inc. has vigorously lobbied the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority in an attempt to relocate a proposed Red Line subway 
station, slated to open in the year 2000 on Lankershim Boulevard, a steep 
half-mile downhill from MCA's Universal Studios Hollywood theme park. MCA, 
rather late in the game, argued for a site more convenient to its studios and 
other popular venues, such as CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, according to transportation officials, was that MCA's request 
came so late that a change would cause significant additional costs (estimated 
at $41 million) in building the subway, and construction and design delays of 
up to two years. Transportation authority officials were adamant that MCA 
should defray much, if not all, of the new cost. MCA officials were equally 
adamant that they should not be forced to assume the full bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncomfortable truth here is that a Red Line station closer to MCA's 
property does makes more sense. It would be considerably less objectionable to 
MCA's residential neighbors. And it would ease transportation hassles for the 
several million, both tourists and local residents, who visit Universal City's 
attractions each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, a compromise has been proposed that might allay the transit 
agency's concerns over delays and costs and also meet MCA's wishes for a subway 
station that better accommodates visitors. At the request of Mayor Richard 
Riordan, James M. Okazaki, the chief of the city's transit programs, looked 
into the impasse and came up with what appears to be a win-win solution. He 
suggests using the original Lankershim site but adding an entrance to Universal 
Studios, shuttle service up the hill and roadway improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a workable plan, say county transportation officials. To MCA Development 
President Larry Spungin, it's "an 80-to-90% solution." Now, only a formal 
recommendation of the plan is needed. The transportation authority board should 
do just that -- and thank Riordan and Okazaki for their help.

AIDS WATCH; INDIFFERENCE FIGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the true profiles in courage are recorded for the century's last two 
decades, the life of Randy Shilts surely will be among them. The first openly 
gay reporter for a major American newspaper, he traced the rise of the cruel 
AIDS epidemic for the San Francisco Chronicle and in his 1987 book, "And the 
Band Played On." 
</P>
<P>
 His writing -- marked by dogged reporting, compelling narrative and attention 
to detail -- documented the shameful early indifference to the spreading viral 
plague by government, science and even the gay community itself. His work 
helped shut down gay bathhouses over the protests of San Francisco's 
politically potent but often narrow-minded gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last year, in another book, he shed powerful light on the national issue 
of homosexuals in the military. "Conduct Unbecoming: Gays in the U.S. Military 
From the Vietnam War Through the Gulf War" infuriatingly detailed how the 
military has wasted millions of dollars in ruthless witch hunts that purged the 
ranks of many loyal, capable service people who happened to be gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Shilts was no political advocate. He was above all a fair and principled 
professional journalist pledged to finding the truth, however painful. Often he 
was vilified by gay radicals for his reporting on the bathhouses and for his 
opposition to "outing" of prominent gay people. He told the unhappy story of 
AIDS and wrote there was "no excuse" for the spread of the disease. His death 
Thursday at 42 from the very disease he chronicled brings a tragic end to a 
hero's life.

PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to the President's budget call (Feb. 8) to pay for the health care 
reform package by raising the cigarette tax 99 cents per pack (I suspect a $1 
hike would seem too high): 
</P>
<P>
 I make the modest proposal that President Clinton not limit his sights to the 
smoking vice, but consider raising taxes on the real culprits on the well-being 
of our country. Specifically, a tax could be levied on the fat, cholesterol and 
sodium contained in the foods we eat. This fat tax (let us say .01 cent per 
gram of fat, cholesterol and sodium) would not only raise enough money to pay 
for health care many times over, but also these subsequent increased costs of 
fatty foods (one of the leading contributors to heart disease, hypertension and 
stroke) may lead the Clintons of our nation out of the neighborhood fast-food 
restaurants and into the salad bar, thereby improving the overall health of 
everyone.

<P>
 * Some of the comments about the Congressional Budget Office report on 
changing health expenditures and the health financing system are just plain 
foisting a "numbers game" on the public (Feb. 9). Clinton is the first to put 
on the table a plan that offers health care for all Americans by the year 2000 
and at the same time reduces total health care expenditures. The Congressional 
Budget Office report supports that fact. 
</P>
<P>
 It also agrees that the Health Security Act "holds the promise of reducing the 
deficit in the long term." 
</P>
<P>
 This act so far is the best on the table. Cancer patients and potential cancer 
patients are being devastated by illness. Let's not play "numbers games" on 
them when they can least afford game playing. Let's pass the act knowing it's 
not without controversy and get on with creating a system that "betters our 
best."

 * When I watch C-SPAN, I really get a kick out of the members of both houses

What hypocrisy! These same members, along with their dependents and employees, 
get full health care free at the expense of their employer, the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers/employers should pull the covers off Congress and demand that it 
adopt a single standard so both the taxpayer/employer and Congress pay the same 
for health care.

<P>
 Yet, a review of programs eliminated in the new budget (Feb. 8) reveals that 
the largest program cut, and the only program cut totally in the Justice 
Department, is the Byrne Anti-Drug Abuse Formal Grant Program.

<P>
 The Administration has apparently embraced intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for a war protester President and a "caring" attorney general, the lure 
of clandestine raids, automatic weapons and high-tech Defense Department 
surplus is too hard to resist. 
</P>
<P>
 Add drug abuse to the increasingly long list of America's social ills which 
are being institutionalized by government.

REGULATING SEAFOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The seafood industry is in strong support of the new regulatory program 
recently announced by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner David 
Kessler and discussed in the paper's Feb. 1 editorial and in a Jan. 27 article. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several points about the new inspection program and the seafood 
industry that need to be clarified.This program represents a complete change in 
philosophy as to how the federal government will inspect food products in the 
future. The new program takes a proactive approach to food safety by preventing 
problems rather than correcting them after they have occurred. The approach 
that will be used by the seafood industry has been recommended by the 
prestigious National Academy of Sciences and is being considered for the meat 
and poultry industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety record of the seafood industry is a strong one, and under this new 
program, improvements will continue to be made. According to recent statistics 
from the FDA, less than 1% of food-borne illnesses are attributable to seafood, 
and this program aims at reducing this low number even further. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed regulations specifically call for processors to monitor for the 
presence of chemical contaminants in species where such problems are reasonably 
likely to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the new FDA program for fishery products is tough and legally 
enforceable with severe penalties for non-compliance. It is hardly an "honor 
system," even though, as with all laws in this country, full compliance depends 
largely on responsible citizenship. The fact that the seafood industry has 
consistently supported the new regulatory program should amply demonstrate this 
industry's sense of responsibility to its customers and the law.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; HOW NOT TO CONDUCT A TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1992 Santa Ana trial of orthopedic surgeon Thomas A. Gionis on charges of 
arranging an attack on his estranged wife, the daughter of actor John Wayne, 
displayed such a high profile that Court TV, a national cable channel, chose to 
cover it. It also has turned out to be an example of how the district 
attorney's office should not conduct a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal this week overturned Gionis' conviction on 
four felony charges stemming from the alleged attack on Aissa Wayne and her 
boyfriend in 1988, while she and Gionis were engaged in a bitter custody 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said the trial judge wrongly allowed testimony from a lawyer who had 
represented Gionis in a civil case. But even without that, the court said, then 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey A. Robinson engaged in a personal attack on Gionis' 
trial lawyer, Bruce Cutler, that was so over-the-top excessive as to warrant 
reversing the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The court rapped Robinson for his "vitriolic rebuttal and personal attacks" on 
Cutler, best known as the lawyer for New York mobster John Gotti. Robinson, now 
in private practice, rejected the criticism, saying Gionis got a fair trial. 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district attorney's office should make prosecutors aware of the 
court's reasoning. The same appeals court had warned Robinson about his conduct 
in another case, and this time it justifiably noted the unnecessary cost 
taxpayers would bear if the case is tried a third time. Gionis' first trial, 
with a different prosecutor and defense attorney, ended with a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
 More important than money is justice. It would be as bad to be forced to free 
a guilty man or woman because of prosecutorial misconduct as to convict an 
innocent person. This case should remind prosecutors of the need to follow the 
rules.

DUCKS: NORDIQUES SCORE ON TWO-MAN ADVANTAGE, AND WIN, 1-0. FISET RECORDS SECOND 
CAREER SHUTOUT. 
</P>

<P>
 It was a battle of the dullest kind, between two faltering opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a struggle of two pitiful power plays -- powerless power plays, really. 
</P>
<P>
 But though it looked for all the world as if neither team might score, the 
Quebec Nordiques managed to edge the Mighty Ducks by the slimmest of margins 
Friday, 1-0, in front of a sellout crowd of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a 0-0 tie for half a second short of 40 minutes before Scott 
Young scored on a deflection of Alexei Gusarov's point shot at 19:59 of the 
second period with Quebec holding a two-man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take .5 seconds out of the game and it's 0-0," goaltender Ron Tugnutt said. 
He made 24 saves and lost, but there wasn't much difference between him and 
Quebec's Stephane Fiset, who made 28 saves for his second career shutout and 
the Nordiques' first since the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' lackluster performance cost them a chance to open a four-point lead 
on the Kings and close to one point behind San Jose for the last Western 
Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had three or four defensemen who were awful. We had a number of forwards 
who didn't participate. We had guys in neutral, not contributing either way," 
Coach Ron Wilson said. "Every game is important, every point is important, 
especially with L.A. losing. It's inexcusable not to be ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was it more evident than in the ongoing string of power plays in a 
game that matched two of the NHL's worst teams when they have an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks entered the game with a power play that ranked 23rd, scoring on only 
16% of its opportunities. And it is a bad power play on a bad streak -- the 
Ducks had scored in only five of their last 49 opportunities before the game, 
and went 0 for 7 against Quebec to make it 5-56. 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly, the Nordique power play is even worse, entering the game ranked 
25th at 14.8%, only marginally better than Tampa Bay, a team whose power play 
is so bad Lightning Coach Terry Crisp has joked he ought to decline penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nordiques failed on their first five power plays, but finally, with a 
two-man advantage for 1:17 at the end on the second period, even they could 
fail no more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nordiques, skating 5-on-3 after Sean Hill was sent off for slashing and 
Bobby Dollas joined him in the penalty box for roughing. And Quebec effectively 
had a 5-on-2 advantage for a few seconds when Bob Corkum chased a puck and got 
caught behind the play. But the Nordiques still couldn't score, missing high or 
wide or being stopped even after skating to within 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadlock was finally broken when Young deflected Alexei Gusarov's slap 
shot from the left point after the Nordiques won a faceoff with just seconds 
left in the second period. The puck trickled in to the right of Tugnutt and 
crossed the goal line with less than one second left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the third, in a final effort to tie, Wilson pulled Tugnutt for an 
extra attacker with 1:35, but the last-gasp effort was botched by a lost 
faceoff, meaning Tugnutt had to come back out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a sloppy game," Tugnutt said. "When one team is sloppy, then 
the other team gets sloppy." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Left wing Garry Valk was assessed a high-sticking major and game misconduct in 
the first period. "I think (referee Terry Gregson) made the wrong call because 
the guy was going down to block a pass, possibly the highest was waist level. 
We'll have that sent in to the league and I'm sure it will be rescinded. I just 
wish there was a way to review these things so that you don't lose an important 
player so early in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is the only general manager who has not made a trade since the 
season began, Jack Ferreira said he is actively looking for a scorer. "I'm 
trying," he said. "A lot of people don't know who the hell our players are. I'm 
serious ."

EVEN MCSORLEY ISN'T ENOUGH; HOCKEY: HE SCORES QUICKLY IN RETURN AS A KING, BUT 
COMMITS TWO MISCUES TO AID THE FLYERS' 4-3 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 It was Marty McSorley's night at the Forum on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 For 27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the crowd cheering in the pregame warm-ups before his first appearance 
as a King since the end of the Stanley Cup finals eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the adrenaline flowing in his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 He got a huge ovation when he was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 And he got the puck into the net on his first shift, taking a pass from Wayne 
Gretzky and putting it between the pads of Philadelphia Flyer goalie Dominic 
Roussel for his fourth goal of the season 27 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the triumphant return. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory went to the other side, two McSorley turnovers leading to Flyer 
goals that proved crucial as Philadelphia scored a 4-3 victory before a sellout 
crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley was disappointed after failing to get the one thing he most 
desperately wanted on Day 1 of his second tour as a King -- a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost," he said, "so there is nothing to relish or feel good about." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky did his best to temper the great expectations over the return of his 
long-time teammate in both Edmonton and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy can't be a savior," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Kings, Stanley Cup finalists a year ago, reeling dangerously close to 
missing the playoffs, the pressure was on to find someone such as McSorley, who 
had been traded in the off-season -- someone big and aggressive, both at the 
blue line and in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than settle for a reasonable facsimile, the Kings went out and got the 
genuine article, pulling off a trade with Pittsburgh last Tuesday to bring 
McSorley, one of the team's most popular players ever, back to the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pumped," McSorley said of his mood before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the goal, he said, "It was fun. I'll take a few more of those." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Melrose made the most of McSorley, using the defenseman for large 
chunks of time at both even strength and on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great player, a great person and a leader," Melrose said. "And you can 
never have enough of those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley's troubles began at the start of the second period when he lost the 
puck, Philadelphia taking advantage to tie the score on Mark Recchi's 31st 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flyers took the lead when Gretzky drew a rare trip to the penalty box, 
called for holding a stick. 
</P>
<P>
 With a man advantage, Philadelphia's Eric Lindros controlled a rebound that 
King goalie Robb Stauber couldn't hold and put the puck back between Stauber's 
pads for his 31st goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the period had ended, Robert Lang had again tied the score with his 
third goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the third period, McSorley fanned on a shot, Philadelphia taking 
control and moving quickly into the Kings' zone, where Mikael Renberg put the 
puck in the net, smashing it between Stauber and McSorley to give Philadelphia 
a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 When Melrose pulled Stauber with 1:40 to play, Lindros got the clincher, 
putting his team-leading 32nd goal into the empty net. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Rychel's ninth goal in the final minute was too little too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, the Kings' third in a row, drops them to 21-30-6 and leaves them 
five points behind the San Jose Sharks, owners of the final playoff spot in the 
Western Conference and the Kings' opponents tonight in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia is 27-29-4 after sweeping their two-game season series with the 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Can McSorley give the Kings the boost they need to make the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't lead without leading on the ice," McSorley said. "Nobody is going 
to listen to somebody who doesn't show it first." 
</P>
<P>
 * A REAL STRUGGLE: The Mighty Ducks prove to be only slightly more inept on 
offense than Quebec in a 1-0 loss to the Nordiques. C6

TONYA GETS TO SKATE, AND A LOT OF READERS ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In rapid succession, the U.S. Figure Skating Assn., a Clackamas County judge 
and the U.S. Olympic Committee decided not to decide, and the hot potato has 
double-axeled her way onto the practice ice in Hamar, Norway. Astonishingly, 
having so publicly wilted in its faint-hearted defense of the phantom notion of 
an "Olympic ideal," the USOC has summoned the chutzpah to appeal to the 
International Skating Union and even (IOC President) Juan Antonio Samaranch to 
change Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding's practice schedules so they won't have 
to share the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale is clear: The USOC made a spineless decision, and now 
desperately wants someone to kiss and make it better. The USFSA and USOC have 
zambonied their own ice; now let them skate on it.

 Lynch-mob leader, oops, Sports Editor Bill Dwyre (Feb. 13) should be informed 
of the concept of due process. This difficult principle he so cavalierly wishes 
to sidestep is troublesome because, in his mind, Tonya Harding is guilty of 
something worse than having pitiful taste in men. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Dwyre calls the USOC spineless. I call them smart. The USOC, in not 
heeding ill-founded opinions from assassin/journalists such as Mr. Dwyre, who 
are more than willing to shoot first and ask later, showed excellent judgment, 
for they knew they had no legal leg to stand on, good knees or no.

 I give Bill Dwyre a gold for his commentary. Like the Wizard of Oz, the USOC 
is but a shell of the ideals they profess to exemplify. 
</P>
<P>
 If the USOC really wanted to reduce the controversy in Lillehammer, then they 
should have excluded the cause, one admitted liar, from the American team. 
Maybe the USOC should go to Oz and ask the Wizard for some heart, brains and 
courage.

 Bill Dwyre is certainly entitled to his opinion regarding the USOC's decision 
on Tonya Harding. However, Mr. Dwyre does not know what he is talking about 
when he places the blame on Harding's lawyers and the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwyre says: "Tonya Harding might be the greatest bonanza to billable hours in 
the history of the State of Oregon." Tonya's lawyers accomplished for their 
client the ultimate 100% victory with a bare minimum of billable hours. In 
reaching this victory in a very short time, the lawyers very likely cut 
themselves out of a fee of $10 million or so, to which they would have been 
entitled on a recovery of a $25-million judgment.

all the events. Who wants to watch the downhill when you already know Tommy Moe

BLAME THE SCHEDULE FOR USC'S TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Raveling is absolutely correct, he has the same group of people that 
had a 7-2 record prior to Pac-10 play (Feb. 10).This is certainly not any 
accomplishment he should advertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he can review the schedule that made him 7-2. If he could reschedule 
the same teams for the balance of the season, he would end up 14-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it, the Trojans should forget about this season. They got beat by 
30 by Washington State and 29 by UCLA. Something I'm sure Mr. Raveling is proud 
of.

JORDAN RULES MIGHT NOT APPLY TO BASEBALL

 Apparently, Michael Jordan believes his .269 batting average during Babe Ruth 
baseball qualifies him to play in the major leagues. I batted 30 points better 
than that during my Babe Ruth career, and the highest level of success I ever 
achieved was municipal slow-pitch softball.As player-coach of a team in Santa 
Monica, I would certainly consider giving him a tryout. He can call me at 
1-800-GET REAL.

wisdom, Michael Jordan exiled himself. Now we have 12 mortals exercising their 
full powers rather than one. 
</P>

 I agree with Jim Murray's analysis (Feb. 13) of the major league curveball, so 
Mr. Jordan is at small risk to get exiled a second time.

TRADE FOR MCSORLEY TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE?

 As a longtime King fan who had finally seen the team turn the corner to 
respectability, it upsets me to watch General Manager Nick Beverley tear this 
team apart. During his two-year tenure, he has traded the likes of All-Stars 
Paul Coffey, Bob Kudelski, Jimmy Carson and Tomas Sandstrom for players such as 
Gary Shuchuk, Doug Houda, the venerable Jim Thomson and now Jim Paek. 
</P>
<P>
 As Beverley will soon find out, the Kings have many more problems than even 
Marty McSorley's broad shoulders can carry.

 Danny Manning showed where he stood on his left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 With his best friend, Ron Harper, suspended for Friday night's game against 
the Atlanta Hawks for making derogatory comments about the Clippers, Manning 
wore a sweatband with No. 4, Harper's uniform number, on his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a sweatband for No. 4," Manning said. "It's also Spud Webb's number, 
what are you trying to say? You make of it what you like. It was a sweatband 
with No. 4." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning replaced Harper at shooting guard, and came within one assist of 
getting his second triple-double of the season in a 97-91 loss to the Hawks 
before 12,500 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning -- who had 27 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists -- one shy of his 
career high, was visibly upset after not getting the triple-double. 
</P>
<P>
 "One assist!," he said as he studied a stat sheet after the game. "Y'all 
supposed to find me a . . . . assist." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Manning think the suspension of Harper, which cost the guard $48,780.49, 
was fair? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like it holds any water," Manning said. "It doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Manning told a wire service reporter: It's the first time I've heard 
of someone being suspended for speaking the truth. Never assume, he could be 
talking about the city." 
</P>
<P>
 What did the Clippers miss by not having Harper, their second leading scorer? 
</P>
<P>
 "We missed 18 or 19 points a game, that's what we missed," Manning said. "It 
kind of throws off your rotation when you don't have one of your starters that 
you've been depending on all year. Ron's a slasher. This is the type of game he 
excels at." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning didn't have much trouble switching to guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it is just your mind set," Manning said. "You can't crash the 
boards, and you have to make sure we have some type of floor balance when we 
have the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who wasn't allowed to sit on the bench or be in uniform, declined 
comment Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Charles Outlaw, signed to a 10-day contract on Monday, replaced Manning 
at small forward and did a good job against Hawk forward Dominique Wilkins, who 
missed 13 of 20 shots and scored 19 points. Outlaw had 10 points and nine 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clippers couldn't contain reserve guard Craig Ehlo, who sank five 
three-point shots and scored 20 points, including 15 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed, 86-77, outscored Atlanta, 10-3, to cut it to 89-87. 
Manning had the final four points in the run, hitting a pair of free throws and 
a jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hawks outscored the Clippers, 10-4, in the final 4:23 to hand the 
Clippers (17-31) their second loss in a row. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Grantham, executive director of the National Basketball Players Assn., 
said he plans to meet with Ron Harper and his agent, Mark Termini, this weekend 
before deciding whether to file a grievance over Harper's one-game suspension.

PHOENIX SPOILS WORTHY'S NIGHT; PRO BASKETBALL: SUNS GAIN 113-96 VICTORY 
ALTHOUGH FORWARD BECOMES FIFTH LAKER TO REACH 16,000-POINT MILESTONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Current Laker fortunes continued on pace Friday night with another game and 
another defeat, but there was still time for a brief nod to the past. 
</P>
<P>
 James Worthy provided the moment, slashing across the lane and nailing a soft 
jump shot early in the second quarter of a 113-96 loss to the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 For Worthy, eight days short of his 33rd birthday, it was a basket like no 
other because it put him over 16,000 points for his Laker career. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other, bigger Laker names have gone there before him -- Elgin Baylor, 
Jerry West, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson -- but Worthy is there 
nonetheless, even if it is on sore knees and a memory of what he once was. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Worthy wants you to know something. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like '85," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it isn't, because that was nine years ago in one of the Lakers' most 
prized seasons when they defeated the Boston Celtics for the first time to win 
the NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers aren't the same and clearly neither is Worthy, who isn't at all 
upset or sad or worried about what has happened to him as his Laker career 
winds down and Laker defeats pile up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel privileged to be a part of that group who did it before," he said. 
'For some reason, I never felt I was on the same level . . . maybe the next 
level down. I was part of a team where my scoring was not always the main 
objective. It's history now." 
</P>
<P>
 What Worthy accomplished as a Laker is a piece of history still in action. Be 
careful not to say relic. Randy Pfund said the Lakers need him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going through a tough time, trying to do the right thing, blend in the 
young guys, but we still need him," Pfund said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers needed a lot more than Worthy to defeat the Suns, who flexed their 
muscles with 28 offensive rebounds and once again back at full strength with a 
32-point outburst by Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddeningly up and down, the Lakers followed a 37-point first quarter with a 
16-point second quarter yet still hung around long enough to get disappointed 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell, who had 25 points, drove the lane to bring the Lakers to 
within 93-90, but Phoenix scored 10 points in 1 1/2 minutes and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Johnson drove the lane for a basket, Campbell missed with the shot clock 
running out, A.C. Green made one free throw and missed the second, but Barkley 
snagged the rebound and put it back in for a 98-90 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns turned out the Laker lights on Barkley's three-pointer that made it 
106-92 with 2:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy closed out his milestone night with 10 points in 17 minutes. That used 
to be a good half for him, but Worthy knows he isn't what he used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember the last time I dunked or finished a fast break," he said. 
"I can't just outrun anybody down the court. It's nothing to be sad about. 
Those are just the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have made it this far and to still be able to come off the bench, I'm very 
happy. You just have to make adjustments. I can remember Kareem going through 
it, I remember Dr. J going through it." 
</P>
<P>
 And now Worthy is going through it. While he's still a Laker, there's no need 
to feel sorry for him, though. You see, Worthy has a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still got some tricks left up my sleeve," he said. Laker Career Point

NBA ROUNDUP; PAYBACK IS SWEET FOR MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You would think Orlando hadn't been around long enough to spawn any enmity in 
the NBA, but the Magic apparently works fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it just takes things a bit personally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic players avenged what they considered a personal slight of their meal 
ticket, Shaquille O'Neal, feeding him enough for him to score 38 points Friday 
night in a 124-93 rout of the Seattle SuperSonics at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 He fed himself a bit, too, grabbing 20 rebounds against the team with the 
NBA's best record and three all-stars, including Coach George Karl. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently that was the rub. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando lost to Seattle by 24 points on Dec. 14 in a game in which O'Neal was 
ejected for committing a flagrant foul against Shawn Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
 In the All-Star game Sunday, O'Neal was double- and triple-teamed, being held 
to eight points, and his Orlando teammates believed Seattle's all-stars, Kemp, 
Gary Payton and Karl, wanted to make him look bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was motivated, but Penny (Anfernee Hardaway) was real motivated," O'Neal 
said. "He was mad. There were tears in his eyes. He said, 'Those guys tried to 
embarrass you. When we play them, I'll get you the ball 50 times. You'll get 50 
dunks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal made 16 of 19 shots, most of them dunks. He has averaged 37 points and 
22 rebounds in two games since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 113, Washington 110 -- Kenny Anderson missed his first six shots, 
then scored a career-high 42 points, including the game-winning layup over 
7-foot-7 rookie Georghe Muresan with 7.5 seconds to play at Baltimore, as the 
Nets won their fourth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 109, Chicago 84 -- Bryant Stith scored eight of his 28 points as the 
Nuggets started the second half with a 21-9 run that lifted them at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 106, Charlotte 99 -- Ken Norman scored 25 points to lead six players 
in double figures at Charlotte, N.C., as the Bucks ended a three-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 85, Minnesota 78 -- Mark Price and Brad Daugherty combined for 
11-for-31 shooting at Minneapolis, but the Cavaliers' substitutes outscored the 
Timberwolves' reserves, 34-4, in their ninth loss in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 109, Philadelphia 93 -- Clifford Robinson scored 30 points as the 
Trail Blazers won at Portland after 76er rookie center Shawn Bradley strained 
ligaments when he twisted his left knee after a collision with Harvey Grant 37 
seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 90, Utah 81 -- Mitch Richmond of the Kings missed 14 of 17 shots 
through three quarters, then recovered to score 18 of his 27 points in the 
fourth quarter at Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
 Richmond scored five points in a 7-0 run that gave the Kings an 83-75 lead 
with 1:15 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel Simmons scored 18 points for Sacramento, which has won four of its last 
five games.

NHL ROUNDUP; CAPITALS SWITCH ON THE POWER PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Washington Capitals had been playing as though points were awarded for 
style. Their power play was lovely to watch, but basically powerless, as 
witness a one-for-26 performance going into Friday's game against the New York 
Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 It became one for 29 before Randy Burridge and Dimitri Khristich scored 
power-play goals in the second period and Al Iafrate added one in the third in 
a 3-1 victory over the Islanders at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easy enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to shoot to score," center Mike Ridley said. "We've been a little 
guilty of trying to work the pretty play, rolling in and out all over the 
place. The best solution is to keep firing at the goalie." 
</P>
<P>
 The Capitals did in stretching their record to 5-0-1 over the last six games 
and 8-2-1 under new Coach Jim Schoenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 5, Edmonton 1 -- Ray Sheppard scored the 200th goal of his career and 
Paul Coffey had three assists for the Red Wings at home as Edmonton's winless 
streak stretched to six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard's goal, on a power play, was also his 44th of the season, tying 
Toronto's Dave Andreychuk for the NHL lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit won its fourth in five games; Edmonton dropped to 0-5-1 in its last 
six. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 3, Ottawa 0 -- Adam Graves scored two goals and assisted on 
another at New York in a game between the teams with the NHL's best and worst 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senators failed to win for the 11th consecutive game (0-8-3). Their 
NHL-worst record is 9-43-8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers lead the overall NHL standings with a 37-15-4 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 4, Florida 1 -- Donald Audette scored two power-play goals and Dominik 
Hasek stopped 27 shots to lead the Sabres at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Dawe and Brad May also scored as the Sabres beat Florida for the first 
time in three meetings this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 4, Calgary 2 -- Russ Courtnall and Mike Modano each had a goal and an 
assist as the Stars won at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas is 8-2-0 in its last 10 games. Calgary had won six of its previous 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 3, Boston 1 -- Brendan Shanahan and Brett Hull scored power-play 
goals seven seconds apart in the third period, and Curtis Joseph blocked 40 
shots for the Blues at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, Winnipeg 2 -- Michel Goulet moved into a tie with Maurice Richard 
for 11th on the NHL's all-time scoring list with his 544th goal and the 
Blackhawks won at Winnipeg to extend the Jets' winless streak to 14 games.

 Summers in California, winters playing hockey in Rouen, France. . . . As 
French Olympic left wing Eric Lemarque says cheerfully, "Life's a beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Lemarque, the son of a French father and an American mother, grew up in 
Southern California and began playing hockey in the now-defunct Topanga Hockey 
Assn. and in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemarque later went to Detroit for two seasons, finished high school a year 
early and attended Northern Michigan University on a full scholarship. He was 
drafted by the Boston Bruins after his first year -- he earned a degree in 
marketing and a place among the school's top 10 goal scorers -- but wasn't 
offered a contract and so went to France. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my French passport now because European citizens can play in other 
leagues in other countries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemarque, 24, returns to Manhattan Beach each summer, except for the six weeks 
he teaches at hockey schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my third season in the French European League and first on the 
national team," he said. "This has just worked out great."

U.S. GETS ITS LICKS, BUT MISSES BY TICK; LUGE: AMERICAN TEAMS FINISH FOURTH AND 
FIFTH IN TWO-MAN EVENT FOR BEST OLYMPIC SHOWING. 
</P>

<P>
 It's the top man's feet, the bottom man's shoulders. Body language is vital in 
luge doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not communicating it ain't going to work," Mark Grimmette said. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked for U.S. sledders Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not well enough yet to win a medal in this back-to-the-wall sport, but for the 
U.S. Luge Federation, progress is the most important product. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth-place finish by Grimmette and Jonathon Edwards in Winter Olympics 
doubles Friday was the best U.S. luge finish in any Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer were a tick behind in fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Wendel Suckow's fifth place last Monday had been a U.S. best in 
men's singles and that Duncan Kennedy apparently had been on a medal pace when 
he crashed, Ron Rossi, executive director of U.S. Luge, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be tough to improve on what we did here and not win a medal in '98. 
I'm not happy that it didn't happen here, but we're making progress. We're even 
with the Austrians and just behind the Germans and Italians." 
</P>
<P>
 Luge became a permanent Olympic sport in '64. Germans, Italians, Austrians and 
Soviets have won all 81 medals. 
</P>
<P>
 It was viva Italia! Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Brugger and Wilfried Huber, seventh in the Calgary Olympics and fifth at 
Albertville, won the gold by 0.049 seconds over countrymen Hans Raffl and 
Norbert Huber, Wilfried's brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending Olympic champions Stefan Krausse and Jan Behrendt of Germany were 
third, 0.344 of a second ahead of Grimmette and Edwards, who were 0.008 ahead 
of Sheer and Thorpe. 
</P>
<P>
 Luge doubles is a two-heat, one-day event, compared to the four heats and two 
days of singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest ranger Brugger, 24, and police officer Huber, 23, caught first-heat 
leaders Raffl, 35, and Norbert Huber, 29, with a 48.372 second heat compared to 
48.495. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheer and Thorpe, fourth overall in World Cup this season and fourth after the 
first heat, needed to eclipse the Raffl-Huber course record of 48.274 to finish 
third. They did 48.725 and were edged out of fourth by the 48.672 of 
Grimmette-Edwards, who were fifth after the first heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've focused on being best in the world, not just the U.S.," Grimmette said. 
"We're happy to finish fourth, but we're not where we want to be yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes quite a few years to learn luge skills. Hans Raffl has been sliding 
almost as long as I've been alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimmette, 23, and Edwards, 21, fourth in World Cup a year ago but an injured 
and inconsistent 12th this season, have been together since 1988, as have 
Sheer, 22, and Thorpe, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 All four, Thorpe said Friday, felt they were on the bubble in singles but have 
thrived on the teamwork of doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 How close are they to consistently catching the Italians and Germans? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be there next year," Thorpe said, adding that his and Sheer's next goal 
is to win the overall World Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
 The '98 Olympics? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to go, but it's up to Gordy," Thorpe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might move on, and I'd have to start over with a new partner." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheer is a part-time student at Ohio State. Edwards is considering Stanford, 
Yale and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams are taking it year to year. Partnerships are as difficult to 
develop as friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to know each other inside out," Sheer said the other day. "Chris and 
I have literally butted heads a few times, but basically there's total trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pretty much spend every day of our lives together. I mean, we sometimes 
get upset like brothers, but if you hold a grudge on the ice, you're going to 
end up killing each other." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a strange business, two grown men literally lying on top of each other on 
a small sled, traveling up to 75 m.p.h., each with only peripheral vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration and tension are easily transmitted. Any unplanned or unexpected 
movement can upset the aerodynamics -- and relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very much like family, and no one has a better feel for it than the 
Hubers -- Wilfried, Norbert and Arnold, who did not qualify here. Along with 
bobsledding brother Gunther, who begins competition today, Italy's royal family 
of sledding has won 42 medals in Olympics, World Cup and European 
championships. While the U.S. attempts to build teams, the Hubers have their 
own.

NOTEBOOK; BEDARD OF CANADA SCORES HISTORIC FIRST IN WOMEN'S BIATHLON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Canadian Myriam Bedard made history Friday in the women's 15-kilometer 
biathlon, becoming the first Olympic champion from North America. Biathlon 
combines cross-country skiing and target shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard, who finished third in the 1992 Olympics, missed only two targets on 
the shooting range and skied the tough course in 52 minutes 6.6 seconds. Anne 
Briand of France was second. She skied 46.7 seconds slower than Bedard and had 
three misses. Uschi Disl of Germany also missed three times and finished 1:08.7 
behind Bedard, taking the bronze medal.

<P>
 Joan Smith of Honeoye Falls, N.Y., placed 14th, the best finish ever by a U.S. 
woman, and her teammate, Joan Guetschow of Minnetonka, Minn., was 17th, marking 
the first time that two U.S. athletes finished in the top 20.

 According to a Lillehammer press agency, Rodney Woolford of the Trinidad 
bobsled team "has had enough of Lillehammer." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Rodney's luggage containing all his warm clothing and training 
gear failed to arrive with Rodney from the islands. Then, when it did turn up, 
half his gear was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 A cardboard box full of team gear also has disappeared, then Woolford got sick 
and will be unable to compete.

 Possibly more good news for U.S. skiers? 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo Street of Sun Valley, Ida., won the final training run for the women's 
downhill, to be raced today. 
</P>
<P>
 Street's time of 1 minute 36.50 seconds was .19 faster than German's Katja 
Seizinger, the race favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the downhill here," Street said. "There's a lot going on all the way 
down. And the snow is really hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Hilary Lindh, the defending Olympic silver medalist, was 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Parisien, meanwhile, is looking like a medal threat in the women's 
combined, a two-day event that combines the times for a separate downhill and 
slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien, not noted as much of a speed skier, has taken a liking to the 
Kvitfjell downhill course and has been among the training leaders for skiers 
who will also ski combined. 
</P>
<P>
 If Parisien can finish high in the downhill, she figures to make up 
considerable time on the others in the slalom, her specialty.

 After much soul searching, Canada's Kerrin Lee-Gartner has decided to race in 
today's downhill.

 Lee-Gartner has been deeply affected by the recent death of her good friend, 
Austrian Ulrike Maier, killed Jan. 29 in a downhill crash at 
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.

<P>
 Lee-Gartner, the defending Olympic champion, has not competed in a downhill 
race since Maier's death.

 "I made a lot of mistakes today," she said after placing 31st in downhill 
training. "But it was fun to race again." CHRIS DUFRESNE

NOW GERMANS TAKE IT OUT ON RUSSIANS

 Beating the Tulsa Oilers was never like this. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludek Bukac, who played for Oklahoma City of the old Central Hockey League in 
1964, achieved a first in German Olympic hockey history Friday when he coached 
his team to a 4-2 victory over Russia.Germany was 0-8 in the Olympics against 
Russia and its predecessors, having scored only nine goals and given up 61. 
Germany was 1-79-2 against Russia in all matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winning of games is pushing us forward, making progress for hockey in 
Germany," said Bukac, who also coached the Czech national team for six years 
and had never defeated the Soviets. "If you play successfully, the coach lives 
for another day." 
</P>
<P>
 Bukac seems to have little to fear after leading Germany to a fifth-place 
finish in the 1993 World Championships and a 3-1 record here. Friday's triumph, 
in which three-time Olympian Bernd Truntschka scored his first two Olympic 
goals, gave Germany a berth in the medal round. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia is 2-2 after starting the Games with a 60-6-2 record since its hockey 
debut in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense is the weakest part of our game," assistant Russian coach Igor 
Dmitriev said. "We have to improve in that area. . . . This team is losing its 
self-assurance, and it is not the team it was before." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bukac: "In our day, the Russians were always a strong team, but this 
competition is tougher now because the Russians are not a dominating team. The 
bottom teams are competing better, so it's not easy to play them."

TUGNUTT CAN'T QUITE SAVE THE DAY FOR MIGHTY DUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Goaltender Ron Tugnutt saw the windup clearly. But then the tangle of bodies 
moved in front of the net and he had to rely on guess work. 
</P>
<P>
 In a flash, the puck was past Tugnutt and into the back of the Mighty Duck 
net. Goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec's Mike Ricci won a faceoff, sending the puck along the boards to Martin 
Rucinsky, who passed it back to Alexei Gusarov, who was standing just inside 
the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
 Gusarov faded left, toward the center of the rink, and fired a slap shot 
toward Tugnutt.  
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt had a clear view of all that, but saw nothing after the puck left 
Gusarov's stick. Later, someone told Tugnutt that Scott Young had deflected the 
puck, sending it trickling into the net with 0.5 seconds left in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than anything it's anticipation," Tugnutt said of trying to stop a shot 
he can't see. "You hope it hits you or goes wide." 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt handled every other shot easily, but so did Quebec goalie Stephane 
Fiset and the Nordiques won hockey's version of a pitchers' duel, 1-0, Friday 
at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is only supposed to happen for us not against us," Tugnutt said after 
stopping 24 of the 25 shots he faced against his former team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we played well. Their goalie made some key saves. Give Stephane 
credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's game was ugly from start to finish. Even the simplest passes seemed 
to always be mishandled. Scoring chances came and went . . . awry. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for sharp goaltending from Tugnutt and Fiset, it would have been a 
truly forgettable night. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt hadn't donned a Quebec uniform since 1991-92, but he said the 
competitive juices were flowing right from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 He had already beaten the Edmonton Oilers, who did not protect him in the 
expansion draft, three times, including a 6-3 victory Sunday. And there was no 
question that Coach Ron Wilson would start Tugnutt against Quebec, where he 
played for all or part of five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (he and Hebert) have won five out of seven against our former teams," 
Tugnutt said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tugnutt couldn't stop a shot he never saw and a deflection he only heard 
about later and the Ducks lost, 1-0. It was as simply as that.

SOCCER; U.S. RALLIES TO TIE BOLIVIA, 1-1, IN JOE ROBBIE CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. national soccer team graciously accepted the congratulations of Vice 
President Al Gore, who waded through the locker room slapping the backs of 
players as if they had done something spectacular and not merely tied Bolivia, 
1-1, Friday night in the Joe Robbie Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Americans, who played before 15,676 at Joe Robbie Stadium, hardly 
merited such accolades, although they are making some progress and now have a 
1-1-4 record this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in a gusty wind on a rain-soaked field, the United States again came 
from behind, a characteristic that would be more cheering except for the fact 
that it so consistently finds itself behind. Spotting World Cup opponents early 
goals this summer probably won't permit similar results. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a problem," U.S. defender Desmond Armstrong said. "But I think we showed 
a lot of character to be able to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Colombia and Sweden played to a scoreless tie in an earlier game, all 
four teams in the tournament share first place. The United States will play 
Sweden on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team's inability to finish on a winning note has become an ongoing 
problem. What materialized Friday night was a lack of organization on defense. 
Goalkeeper Tony Meola faced more breakaways than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, assistant coach Timo Liekoski had emphatically maintained that 
the team had solved its defensive problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong said: "There were some misjudgments on head balls, but I think we 
settled down in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Cobi Jones got the tying goal in the 78th minute after Mike Burns sent a free 
kick his way on the left side. Jones, shifty and deceptive on the ball and 
difficult to mark, dribbled toward the goal with only a backpedaling defender 
in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 His sharp shot was almost saved by a sliding Bolivian, who only succeeded in 
knocking the ball after it crossed the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burnsie looked at me and I knew he was going to get me the ball," Jones said. 
"I didn't have anyone to cross to and I dribbled it in. I wasn't at a good 
angle, and I hoped it would hit something." 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia's goal came in the 44th minute and resulted from a U.S. defensive 
lapse and a creative play by the goalscorer, Jaime Moreno. He got the ball from 
Alvaro Pena and raced down the right side. Desmond Armstrong went back to 
defend, but didn't make it in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong said he was stuck in the midfield when the team got caught on a 
counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 Meola lunged to his left, and Moreno took off the other way. His bouncing kick 
went in off the hand of Alexi Lalas of the the United States. The referee 
apparently ignored the inadvertent handball because Moreno's shot was clearly 
going in. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno was the game's most active player and was able to exploit the frequent 
instances when American players were out of position.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier game between Colombia and Sweden was played in driving rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams were a man short as Joachim Bjorkland of Sweden and Carlos 
Valderrama were sent off. Neither player may take part in Sunday's matches. 
Colombia will play Bolivia before the United States-Sweden game. 
</P>
<P>
 Valderrama revealed after the game that he had an injured right knee. Team 
officials said Valderrama would undergo an MRI examination.

ESTANCIA UP TO SPEED, BUT PACIFICA STILL WINS; DIVISION III-A: EAGLES COME OUT 
RUNNING, BUT THE MARINERS STREAK OFF WITH A 94-72 VICTORY TO ADVANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Pacifica, that whirlwind of a basketball team, found someone who would come 
out and play Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia wasn't going to hold the ball or play it cagey. The Eagles were going 
to throw caution to the wind and run with the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 When the running was done, the Mariners had a 94-72 victory at Pacifica to 
advance to the second round of the Southern Section III-A boys' basketball 
playoffs. They will play Pasadena Blair on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came to run," said Mariner center Jonathan Surface, who had 15 points and 
10 rebounds. "They did to. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
 It was, that is, from the Pacifica side. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles played at their normal tempo; Pacifica was just better at it. As 
any Garden Grove League coach will attest, you don't run-and-gun with the 
Mariners (24-1). You don't even jog with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica rolled to the league title with a press-and-stress style. Opposing 
teams made a point not to play tag with the Mariners, but Estancia (15-11) 
would have none of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were a running team," guard Chris Vlasic said. "We were anxious 
for this game to begin." 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic certainly was ready. He scored six points in 30 seconds in the first 
quarter. Vlasic made 10 of 16 shots and finished with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
 He had plenty of help. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Alliman scored 17 and Ryan Teague 15. The Mariners came at the Eagles in 
waves. They used 11 players in the first quarter and wore the Eagles down. 
Pacifica forced 29 turnovers, many of which were converted into points off the 
fast break. 
</P>
<P>
 "When love to play at the pace," Surface said. "We have lots of players and we 
keep coming at people." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica didn't waste much time in its set offense, either. The Mariners made 
11 three-pointers. Even Surface, their 6-foot-8 center, stepped outside -- but 
not out of character -- and sank three three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia never had a chance. Whatever the Eagles did, the Mariners did better. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' Mike Drake did a sharp stop-and-pop move, slicing between two 
defenders in the third quarter. Vlasic came right back and, sandwiched between 
two defenders, scooped a shot in under their arms and was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners pulled away with a series of runs. They outscored Estancia, 11-2, 
to take a 25-16 lead at the end of the first quarter. Pacifica went on a 14-0 
tear in the second quarter and led, 57-37 at halftime. A 14-2 run made it 76-47 
with 1 minute 16 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're relentless," Pacifica Coach Bob Becker said. "We don't back off." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did the Eagles. They were just run off.

DIVISION III-AA ROUNDUP; HENDERSON'S 22 POINTS KEY MAGNOLIA VICTORY

<P>
 Senior point guard Frank Henderson scored 22 points and had nine rebounds to 
lead Magnolia to a 52-47 victory over Newport Harbor at Magnolia in a Division 
III-AA boys' basketball playoff game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia will meet Servite in Tuesday's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels (19-7) trailed, 12-10, after one quarter, but outscored the 
Sailors, 15-6, in the second quarter to take a 25-18 halftime lead. Magnolia, 
which recorded its 17th consecutive home victory, extended the lead to 11 
points, 29-18, early in the third quarter. But Newport Harbor (13-14) fought 
back, cutting the lead to four on Will Rankin's basket early in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were in control with that lead, but we didn't play good defense 
and they stayed with us," Magnolia Coach Al Wallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor played without starting center Ramy Shoukry, who underwent an 
emergency appendectomy Monday. His replacement, John Giordani, was brought up 
from the junior varsity. He responded by scoring 11 points, all in the second 
half, to keep the Sailors close. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia's LaShawn Neal sealed the victory, scoring two key baskets in the 
last 1:30 and blocking two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting this first game out of the way is always tough. I was pleased with 
our performance tonight," Wallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Tayyar led Newport Harbor with 12 points. SCOTT JONES

DIVISION I-A ROUNDUP; KROEGER'S BIG PLAY HELPS EDISON WIN IN OVERTIME, 58-57

 Edison needed something extra, and Micah Kroeger delivered it -- a four-point 
play -- to help send the game into overtime before Edison edged Century, 58-57, 
in a Southern Section Division I-A second-round boys' basketball playoff game 
Friday at Edison High. 
</P>
<P>
 With Edison trailing, 54-50, Kroeger, who had 24 points and 10 rebounds, made 
a three-pointer while Ronnie Arristondo fouled him with 12 seconds remaining, 
then made the free throw to send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had our fannies beat," Edison Coach Larry Hirst said. "That was probably 
a game we shouldn't have won, but we'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Century missed the front end of eight one-and-ones in the fourth quarter and 
overtime to help Edison (18-8) advance to the quarterfinals to play Orange, a 
69-61 winner over Corona. Century (23-5) ended its most successful season. 
</P>
<P>
 In overtime, Edison made four of six free throws; Century made three of six. 
Although Thomas Harmon, who had a game-high 26 points for Century, got two good 
shots in the overtime, neither fell and Edison managed to play keep-away and 
run out the final 14 seconds before Century could foul anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Century is the most physical, quick, defensive team we've played," Hirst 
said. "We weren't playing well offensively, but that's a credit to their 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison committed 24 turnovers and shot 34% (11 of 32) from the field in the 
second half, yet rallied from a nine-point deficit in the final 3 minutes 12 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 After Century missed two front ends of one-and-ones, Ali Tofighi, who had 
seven points and 14 rebounds, scored after an offensive rebound to cut the lead 
to 50-46 with 1:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 After two more missed front ends of one-and-ones, a short hook shot by Ben 
Beard drew the Chargers within 50-48 with 1:06 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Visal Yam made four free throws for Century and Kroeger answered with a 
layup, but Yam missed another front end of a one-and-one with 26 seconds left, 
setting up Kroeger's tying score. 
</P>
<P>
 "It finally caught up with us," Century Coach Greg Coombs said. "You can't 
miss free throws like that in the playoffs and expect to win. But we had a 
great season. How many teams can say they won 23 games?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger helped Edison advance by scoring 16 points in the fourth quarter and 
overtime. Darrell Adams added 12 points and two three-pointers for the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division I-A game: 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 90, El Monte Arroyo 39 -- Clay McKnight and Miles Simon each scored 
21 points to lead top-seeded Mater Dei (28-0) at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight had five three-pointers and Simon had 11 assists for the Monarchs, 
who will play Moreno Valley Valley View -- a 71-67 winner in overtime over 
Moreno Valley Canyon Springs -- in the quarterfinals Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schea Cotton had 19 points and 12 rebounds and Shaun Jackson had 16 points and 
10 rebounds for Mater Dei, which led, 56-20, at halftime. Mater Dei is ranked 
second in the nation by USA Today.

ORANGE'S EDGE ON HOME COURT PROVES VALUABLE; DIVISION I-A: WITH A NOISY CROWD 
BEHIND THEM, THE PANTHERS PRODUCE A 69-61 VICTORY OVER CORONA.

 Never underestimate the power of hardwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange's famous home court turned into the Doom Dome for Corona on Friday 
night as the Panthers boys' basketball team advanced to the third round of the 
Division I-A Southern Section playoffs with a 69-61 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big key for us was the home court," said Orange Coach Richard 
Bossenmeyer. "The fans did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange's players didn't exactly slump. But for third-seeded Orange (22-3), a 
lift of the arms to signal crowd noise by the Orange's coaching staff is as 
effective as an admonition to box out. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Gonzales, who scored a game-high 24 points, said the cozy gym was worth 
seven or eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love to play here," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans enthusiastically backed Orange, especially in the fourth quarter. 
Corona's Randy Knoll tied the game at 45-45 on a turn around jumper to start 
the quarter, before Orange scored eight unanswered points for a 53-45 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Clutch Corona (21-5) free-throw shooting and a layup by Eric Knapp cut 
Orange's margin to four, 59-55, with 1:20 left. But Orange slowed down the 
tempo, Corona was forced to foul and Orange had a field day at the foul line, 
where the Panthers were 14 of 16 in the waning minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach makes us shoot 30 free throws a day," said Gonzales. "At the end of 
practice, if we don't make five in a row, or eight out of 10, we have to to 
stay and run." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Orange strong point was its accuracy from three-point range. Gonzales, 
who sported a 47% shooting average behind the arc going into the game, 
increased that number with Friday's performance. All of Gonzales' baskets, save 
for a layup in the fourth quarter, were three-pointers, including four in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange took a 24-18 lead after the first quarter, which Corona cut to 35-30 by 
halftime. In the third, Knapp converted a steal into a three-pointer to pull 
Corona to 45-43. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Harris added 14 points for Orange. Jonny McKee added 22 points for Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange will meet Edison in Tuesday's quarterfinals at a site to be determined.

<P>
 Downey Pius X finished in a three-way tie for third place in the Del Rey 
League and won the coin flip, thanks, in part, to the call of Principal Michael 
Parmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (12-12) then went out and upended highly regarded Whittier 
Christian, 68-56, in the opening round of the IV-A playoffs Friday at Los 
Angeles Chiropractic College. 
</P>
<P>
 "He beat me to the coin flip," Pius X Coach Deon Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 That turned out to be good for Pius X, but bad for Whittier Christian (21-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Downey Pius X put on a three-point shooting exhibition, especially in the 
second half, behind the likes of Allen Fletcher, Marcel Yates and Robert 
Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher finished with 17 points, Yates had 16 and Hargrove 11. 
</P>
<P>
 When the three weren't hurting Whittier Christian's defense from the outside, 
6-foot-7 Troy Collins did the damage inside and finished with 16 points.

PEPPERDINE RECAPTURES WINNING FORM IN ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its basketball team reeling from three consecutive West Coast Conference 
losses, Pepperdine was hoping a win over second-place San Francisco would 
revive its sagging confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves may have received the boost with an 84-62 rout Friday night of the 
Dons before 1,534 at Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved Pepperdine (13-10, 5-6) into a three-way tie for fourth in 
the WCC, one game behind second-place San Francisco (14-8, 6-5) and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 In what has been a trying season, Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury could savor this 
one. At least until his team plays San Diego tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our energy level was as high as it's been in a long time, if not all year," 
Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 As inspired as Pepperdine played, San Francisco played perhaps its worst game 
since a 110-83 loss to Kentucky earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons took their last lead, 10-9, on a three-point basket by guard Gerald 
Walker with 16:10 remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Pepperdine went on a 13-0 spurt and never looked back. Behind 
seven three-pointers, four by point guard Bryan Parker and three by guard Damin 
Lopez, the Waves opened up a 49-25 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so frustrating for San Francisco Coach Jim Brovelli that he decided to 
start five reserves in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine was led by forward Dana Jones with 23 points and nine rebounds, 
Parker had 16 points and Lopez 12.

 With seniors Detra Lockhart, Amy Jalewalia and Natalie Williams leading the 
way, the UCLA women's basketball team broke open a tight game and defeated 
Arizona, 85-69, on Friday night.

seven minutes to go, after Arizona (12-9, 5-7) had cut an eight-point UCLA 
halftime lead to 63-61.  
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart made a 12-foot jump shot, an 18-footer, passed to Jalewalia for a 
basket and made two free throws to help the Bruins build the lead to 71-61 with 
4:39 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart scored a career-high 23 points and had eight assists and five steals 
in 28 minutes. Williams had 26 points and nine rebounds and Jalewalia had 10

N. HOLLYWOOD EMPLOYS PRESS TO CLAIM TITLE; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: THREE-GUARD 
LINEUP HELPS HUSKIES COAST TO 67-56 VICTORY OVER GRANT. 
</P>

 North Hollywood High basketball Coach Steve Miller didn't need the stress. He 
wasn't about to go through a repeat of last week's two-point, overtime victory 
over Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 That game was much too close for comfort. So Miller exchanged the Husky press 
that struggled against Grant last week for a quicker model -- and it roared 
like a mountain lion against the Lancers in an East Valley League finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant could not recover from nine first-quarter turnovers, and North Hollywood 
coasted to a 67-56 victory to claim the league championship. The second-place 
Lancers (18-5, 9-2) finished two games behind the Huskies (17-5, 11-0).  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a press we haven't used all year," Miller said. "We knew we had to 
show them something they've never seen before.' 
</P>
<P>
 Miller switched to a three-guard press to better match up with Grant's 
quickness. Mo Shivers was inserted in the starting lineup in place of Nelson 
Saenz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mo was the key," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant panicked under the pressure of the press in the first quarter, 
committing nine of its 16 turnovers in that period, while North Hollywood burst 
to a 21-14 lead it would never relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood's Damon Ollie, a 6-foot-5 senior center who was tripled-teamed 
in the Huskies two-point victory over Grant last week, broke free often in the 
rematch. Ollie finished with 20 points and 16 rebounds. The Lancers pulled to 
within five points three times in the final 4 minutes 50 seconds, but could get 
no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's Alvin Castro, however, did make it interesting. Castro, who scored 17 
of his team-high 20 points in the second half, hit three of his four 
three-point baskets during a three-minute stretch in the third quarter to pull 
the Lancers to within 41-34. But North Hollywood buried Grant with free throws 
in the fourth quarter. The Huskies converted 17 of 21 at the line in the final 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Lee (18 points) was eight of nine from the line in the final period. 
Fantasia Johnson added 17 points.

NORTHRIDGE HITTERS COME OUT SWINGING; COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL: FAST START POWERS 
MATADORS PAST LOYOLA, 15-2, 15-13, 15-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The way Cal State Northridge started out against Loyola Marymount on Friday 
night, one might have thought the entire Matador men's volleyball team was late 
for a dinner date. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it was Loyola's fault. Were the Lions sloppy on purpose, perhaps 
preferring to take a loss and bolt rather than stick around the newly 
christened "Epicenter," for fear of another aftershock? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, Northridge needed to work much harder in the last two 
games than it did the first one during a 15-2, 15-13, 15-10 sweep of Loyola in 
a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation match before 391. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game was over in 21 minutes. And it would not have lasted that long 
had the Lions not taken a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point on, however, the Matadors had the Lions by the tail. Or, as 
Northridge setter Gary Reznick put it, "Everyone was on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Heitmann, the Matadors' German import, was a commanding presence in the 
middle alongside Craig Hewitt. The 6-foot-7 twin towers were simply too tall 
and too physical for Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann, who came to Northridge from Hamburg, had 16 kills and had a 
match-high .581 hitting percentage. Hewitt had 14 kills and a .385 attacking 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, Jon Baer was not quite as effective percentage-wise, but he 
had 19 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Baer, making his debut as a starter, was not even on the Northridge roster two 
months ago. Last fall, he quit the team for what Price said were "personal 
reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-5 junior from Los Angeles rejoined the team in January and never skipped 
a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was never Mr. Ball Control to start with, and I expected him to take a 
while to get back in shape," Price said. "He's been a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, has been the play of Collin Smith. The freshman from Santa Cruz had 
11 digs for Northridge (5-3, 1-1 in conference play). 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions (3-8, 2-4) had their only look at the match when they had Northridge 
down, 11-6, in the second game. Loyola led, 9-8, in the third game, but Price 
at that point turned to his bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach summoned Chris McGee, a popular senior, and sent him in to replace 
Reznick. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge on Reznick: "He went away from our bread and butter," Price said. 
In other words, Hewitt and Heitmann weren't getting enough sets. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee changed that, ignited the crowd, and even served out the final two 
points of the match.

MASTER'S THWARTED BY A PAIR OF GUARDS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MUSTANGS CAN'T STOP 
BIOLA FROM PENETRATING AND FALL, 88-84, AS 13-GAME WINNING STREAK IS BROKEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An inability to keep the opposition off the offensive boards and to prevent a 
pair of fleet-footed guards from penetrating proved costly to The Master's 
College in a nonconference men's basketball game at Biola University on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being a half-step slow for much of the game, the Mustangs appeared to 
have a chance at sending the game into overtime down the stretch before losing, 
88-84, before 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss snapped Master's 13-game winning streak and was only its second 
defeat in its last 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't do anything to surprise us, but we just had a very difficult time 
containing those two guys (guards Darryl McMillon and Kevin Griffis)," Coach 
Bill Oates said. "And we didn't do a good job rebounding. They got too many 
second shots." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs (24-4), the No. 14-ranked team in the NAIA, trailed, 76-64, with 
seven minutes left before going on a 16-6 run to cut the deficit to 82-80 with 
1:49 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Penberthy, a freshman from Fresno Hoover High, keyed the surge by hitting 
four consecutive shots while scoring 10 of his 15 points, all of which came in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 McMillon, one of the Eagles' high-octane guards, nailed a leaping, 
double-pumping 10-footer in the lane to extend Biola's lead to four, but Emeka 
Okenwa hit an inside shot to cut the Mustangs' deficit to 84-82 with 1:15 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (21-9) made enough key plays after that to win, however. 
</P>
<P>
 First, McMillon hit one of two free throws with a minute remaining to give 
Biola a three-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Master's turnover, Griffis missed the front end of a one-and-one, but 
Chris Samdahl got the offensive rebound -- one of a career-high 16 rebounds for 
the 6-foot-6 senior -- before passing the ball to Griffis, who was fouled by 
Penberthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis (14 points) made one of two free throws to give Biola an 86-82 
advantage, but Master's appeared to be on the verge of cutting its deficit to 
two again when Okenwa went to the foul line for a pair of free throws with 20 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Okenwa, an 80% free-throw shooter entering the game, missed both shots -- his 
sixth and seventh miss of the game without a make -- and after a scramble for 
the loose ball, Samdahl fed a streaking Griffis for the layup with 10 seconds 
remaining that sealed the win for the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figured that we could take it to them one-on-one," Griffis said. "We 
thought we could do better by slashing through the lanes and dishing off if the 
shot wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
 James Mosley had a game-high 19 for Master's.

ROYAL'S SEASON ENDS AMID SERIES OF SOMBER WARNINGS; HIGH SCHOOL SOCCER: 
TOP-SEEDED HIGHLANDERS CAN'T WEATHER CHALLENGE BY EDISON IN FIRST ROUND, 4-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How's this for a series of portents? 
</P>
<P>
 As the Royal High boys' soccer team -- top-seeded in the Southern Section 
Division I playoffs -- prepared for its first-round match against Huntington 
Beach Edison on Friday, the skies began to cloud over. 
</P>
<P>
 As the match started, it started raining. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Edison jumped to a two-goal advantage in the first half, a brief 
hailstorm hit Royal's field. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitting. The Highlanders' season came to a dismal, stormy end in a 4-2 loss to 
the Chargers, who got three goals from senior forward Phil Urkov. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts the most of any year because we played a good solid game," said 
Royal Coach Kevin Corley, in his third season as the Highlander coach. "We just 
had some individuals in the back make some big mistakes. The kind of goals we 
let in really deflate a team. Their first goal was good. Their next three were 
not quality goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Charger players might argue. But there was no debating that Edison is a 
quality team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers finished third in the Sunset League behind powerhouses Santa Ana 
and Marina, so they earned a playoff berth as a wild-card entry -- which 
ordinarily connotes mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were a wild-card team in name only. The Chargers were ranked first in 
the division earlier this season, and they demolished Redondo, 8-1, in a 
Wednesday playoff match. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal's Corley and assistant Andy Silva attended that encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said, 'Oh, boy, this is going to be tough,' " Corley said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was. Urkov gave Edison (19-5-1) a 1-0 lead 10 minutes into the first 
half with a 15-yard shot to the lower left corner of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes later, Charger midfielder Brett Jorgenson got behind the 
Highlanders' defense and flicked a head ball over Highlander goalie Kevin 
Bell's outstretched hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal (21-4-3), which lost in the first round of the playoffs for the second 
consecutive year, closed to 2-1 at halftime on a penalty shot by Chris 
Fernandez, but Urkov scored twice in the second half. The first goal came on a 
rebound that Bell allowed to slip through his hands. The second came on a 
breakaway, and this shot also went off Bell's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great to beat somebody who's No. 1," Urkov said. "Because we were 
there earlier."

BREAKING THE SILENCE; PARENTS' MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR FOR PALMDALE'S SANDOVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After throwing an interception early in the game, Palmdale High quarterback 
Rocque Sandoval made eye contact with his father, John, high in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the clamor of the crowd, father calmed his son, telling him to refocus 
and play smart. Rocque (pronounced Rocky) understood every word, took the field 
and passed or ran for four touchdowns in Palmdale's 34-14 victory over 
Littlerock last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Well out of earshot, they were able to converse because John Sandoval cannot 
speak. Or hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither can Rocque's mother, Karen. Rocque and his three younger siblings -- 
all of whom have normal hearing -- communicate with their parents by sign 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I can see them, I can hear them," says Sandoval, a senior who 
plays center on the school's Golden League champion basketball team that will 
play a second-round playoff game tonight against Hart at The Master's College. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Sandoval, who threw a school-record 25 touchdown passes in the 
fall, accepted a football scholarship to New Mexico. He carries a 3.7 
grade-point average and plans to study premed. 
</P>
<P>
 Enormous achievements by a young man who has overcome extraordinary obstacles. 
Coaches and friends sing his praises. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet from his parents' standpoint, the theme from Rocque is complete silence. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Karen Sandoval cheer their son as wildly as the most leather-lunged 
fan, leaping out of their seats and exchanging hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the crowd roars, they get into it like other people," Rocque says. "They 
can tell when a touchdown is scored or a big shot is made. 
</P>
<P>
 "And after games, I see what kind of expressions they make." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen, especially, is expressive in all sorts of nonverbal ways, exuding 
enthusiasm and warmth through gestures and a delightful twinkle in her eyes. 
John is more stoic, yet pride in his son is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview this week around their living room table, the Sandovals 
were downright talkative, jabbering on by punctuating their rapid signing with 
riveting eye contact and animated facial expressions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocque, who began signing before he could crawl, concentrates on his parents' 
signing with the same intensity he must use recognizing defensive coverages. He 
answers them quickly, his large hands spelling any word he is unable to sign, 
his neck bobbing, his entire body devoted to the task. 
</P>
<P>
 Deprived of a whisper and a scream, the Sandovals engage in the very essence 
of nonverbal communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom and Dad are proud of me," Rocque says, translating his parents' signing. 
"That I'm a success. That I made it. That I earned a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad says I am a really hard worker." 
</P>
<P>
 That said, John and Karen turn to a listener and smile broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Signing comes in especially handy during football and basketball games. How 
many thousands of fathers yearn to talk to their sons during competition? 
</P>
<P>
 John Sandoval, a man living in silence, is able to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his son, he played high school football (yes, quarterback) and basketball 
(averaging 28 points a game). He attended the California School for the Deaf in 
Berkeley, where he met Karen, his wife of 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad knows what is going on," Rocque says. "He knows sports. He's got an 
impressive scrapbook himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Like father, like son. Rocque was among state leaders with 2,675 passing yards 
last year, his first as a starting quarterback. He racked up nine sacks as a 
junior defensive end, but made the transition from pass rusher to pass thrower 
look startlingly easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval (6-foot-2, 185 pounds) learns quickly, something his parents have 
known since he began to sign for milk and water at the age of eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look what he's done in one year," says Jeff Williams, the Palmdale football 
coach. "He's in watching film as much as any coach on our staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rocque is a very intelligent quarterback. He's done things in the last year 
that usually take three years to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 On the basketball court, Sandoval more than holds his own against taller 
players through positioning and toughness. Turns out those days as a defensive 
end come in handy on the hardwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "He plays inside and always covers the opposing team's top big man," says 
Palmdale basketball Coach Garry Phelps, whose team is 22-3 and ranked No. 3 in 
The Times' area poll. "He uses the strength he developed through football." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocque is smart. Rocque is tough. And Rocque is under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in a household where a gentle tap on the shoulder gains 
immeasurably better results than yelling, Sandoval learned restraint. He has 
passed on that knowledge to his brother, Vince, 14, and sisters Kim, 10, and 
Melissa, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls one shouting match with Vince, a 6-4, 230-pound Palmdale freshman 
tight end. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad actually heard us. You have to yell loud for him to hear you, and it 
hurt his ears," Sandoval says, wincing at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Being acutely aware of what a person is feeling is another product of 
Sandoval's upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 His expression darkens at the memory of last week's basketball game at 
Antelope Valley. A fan made fun of John Sandoval's inability to hear and speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me want to go over there and beat the crap out of them," Rocque 
says, laughing nervously at the thought of doing something that cuts across the 
grain of his personality. 
</P>
<P>
 He throws up his hands. "I mean, show some respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval could be excused for being reluctant to take off for college. But he 
and his parents scoff at any notion that he is needed at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family is the same as anyone else's family," he says as his parents nod in 
agreement. "There is nothing strange about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The familiarity of New Mexico attracted Sandoval, who won't turn 18 until 
October and plans to redshirt next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its appeals: topography similar to Palmdale and a substantial deaf 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll try to get credit for signing as a second language and I might work as 
an interpreter for other students," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Sandoval is studying at Antelope Valley College to be a counselor for 
children who cannot hear. When she earns her degree, the family might relocate 
to Oregon, where they believe job opportunities are greater for her and John, a 
construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
 That would take them even farther from their oldest son. If they live in 
Palmdale, they plan to attend New Mexico games at Fresno State and San Diego 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, Rocque can simply write about the game and send it electronically over 
the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has a typewriter-like instrument called a Telecommunications Device 
for the Deaf attached to their phone that enables them to type a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocque re-enacts the few Palmdale games his parents have missed in either 
sport. He brings the games to life in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I act out what happened," he says as his parents grin gleefully at the 
memory. "I'll stand here and actually show them how I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen and John laugh without making a sound. They look lovingly at their son, 
then at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 So much unspoken. So much conveyed.

Borzoni beat Fontana goalkeeper Omar Hernandez to his left.

skipped past Jose Monroy, his intended target, but was knocked in by a hustling 
Jason Benwell.

pass into the net and Marina led comfortably, 3-0, at halftime. 
</P>

pair of fancy moves around two Steeler defenders and hit the corner of the net 
with a shot off his left foot.

MEDEARIS LAUNCHES COMEBACK AT SUNKIST; TRACK: AFTER MISSING STATE FINALS AND 
MOST OF FOOTBALL SEASON BECAUSE OF INJURIES, HART ATHLETE IS HEALTHY AGAIN AND 
AIMING FOR A SCHOLARSHIP AS A HURDLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After having his junior track season and senior football campaign 
short-circuited by injuries, Jason Medearis of Hart High will be one charged-up 
hurdler when he lines up for the 50-meter highs in today's Sunkist Invitational 
indoor track meet at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis was one of the top hurdlers in the state last season -- with a 
personal best of 14.49 seconds in the 110 highs and 38.02 in the 300 
intermediates -- but two unwise decisions prevented him from proving it in the 
state championships. 
</P>
<P>
 He had no control over the first decision -- the cancellation of the state 
finals after California Interscholastic Federation officials ruled that the 
all-weather track at Cerritos College was unsafe for competition when it rained 
the morning of the June event. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the CIF rescheduled the finals after an avalanche of criticism, but 
Medearis didn't run because he suffered a broken bone in his left foot while 
playing football in the L.A. Watts Summer Games passing league tournament June 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned up field and on the second step I heard this huge crack like a cue 
ball landing on concrete," Medearis said. "I realize now that I shouldn't have 
been playing football at that time. . . . It wasn't worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis wore a cast for three weeks, but that was a minor inconvenience 
compared to the nagging thoughts of what might have been had he been able to 
run in the state finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was more successful in the intermediate hurdles during the season, 
Medearis produced a surprising wind-aided 14.11-second clocking in the highs to 
win his qualifying heat in the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked when I did that," Medearis said, still amazed at the memory. "I 
couldn't believe that I could run with the big boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis' injury woes continued during football season. He suffered a 
dislocated shoulder during a Sept. 17 game against Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors told Medearis, a wide receiver-defensive back, that it would take five 
months for the injury to heal, but coaches and teammates urged him to come back 
well ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain in his shoulder combined with the knowledge that an identical 
dislocation would require surgery and sideline him for a year or more made his 
decision not to return an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (I dislocated it again), that would mean no senior track season," Medearis 
said. "And I just couldn't take that chance." 
</P>
<P>
 He had hoped to gain a football scholarship as an integral part of Hart's 
high-powered passing offense, but when he went down with the shoulder injury, 
recruiters lost interest. 
</P>

 Whether Medearis earns a scholarship to an NCAA Division I school now depends 
on how well he performs over the 39-inch highs and 33-inch intermediates.

 "He's not a burner," Coach Larry David said about his protege's lack of elite 
sprinting speed. "But he has just enough speed to go with his technique and 
strength that he's going to put most kids away."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; IRVINE VALLEY PLAYS SPOILER FOR 
SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback, which held a one-game lead with four left, lost its bid for even a 
share of the Orange Empire Conference men's basketball title Friday when it was 
upset, 81-80, by Irvine Valley at Capistrano Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (21-8, 11-3 in conference) started the game tied with Riverside. 
But the Tigers beat Cypress, 79-70, to claim the title outright. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley, which had lost five in a row, got the winning basket with 13 
seconds left when Eugene Patterson picked up a loose ball and made a 10-foot 
baseline jumper to put the Lasers up, 81-80. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, who seldom plays, was in the game because three Irvine Valley 
players had fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback moved the ball up court, and called a timeout with eight seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos got the ball to Tes Whitlock in the corner, but his three-point 
attempt bounced away and time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley Coach Bill Mulligan, between shaking hands and being hugged by 
well-wishers, agreed that it was biggest victory in the two-year history of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't do anything special for me," Mulligan said about beating 
Saddleback and preventing the Gauchos from winning a second consecutive title. 
"I just wanted to beat somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback opened a 30-23 lead with about six minutes left in the first half 
but failed to score the rest of the half. Tom Airey (21 points, all on 
three-pointers) made on consecutive shots to start the Lasers' comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley (18-14, 6-8) led at half, 38-30. The Lasers finished the 
conference race tied for fifth with Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback turned to sophomores Antoine Jefferson (25 points) and Whitlock (30 
points) in the second half to rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos controlled the flow early in the second half and were up, 53-47, 
with about 10 minutes left. But then it was Irvine Valley's turn to rally. 
Rashad Wilson, who was a backup defensive back for the Saddleback football team 
last fall, had 22 for Irvine Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback was in trouble even before the start of the game, when starting 
guard Derrick Walsh walked in wearing street clothes. Walsh, who had scored a 
career-high 25 Wednesday, sat on the bench, but Coach Bill Brummel wouldn't say 
why he didn't play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have no comment," Brummel said. "I hope to be able to say more 
Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 99, Golden West 76 -- Kevin Carlson led the Hornets (25-10, 8-6) 
with 34 points and Eddie Cochran had 21 points and 11 rebounds. Fullerton and 
Rancho Santiago tied for third, but Fullerton will be seeded higher in the 
playoffs because the Hornets beat the Dons twice.  
</P>
<P>
 Chris Reiff had 23 points and Gerald Rhoden had 21 for Golden West (9-21, 
2-12). 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago 88, Orange Coast 83 -- Sean Amos had 23 points and seven 
rebounds, Matt Kordik added 20, and Nathan Small had 19 points and seven 
rebounds to lead visiting Rancho Santiago (20-11, 8-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Loewe scored 19 points, including four three-pointers, and Damion Morbley 
added 18 points and 12 rebounds for Orange Coast (13-16, 3-11). 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange Empire Conference women's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West 71, Fullerton 51 -- The Hornets threw a celebration to honor 
Colleen Riley's last regular-season game as coach, but Golden West spoiled the 
party. Golden West (29-4, 11-1) clinched its fifth consecutive conference title 
earlier. Fullerton (19-14, 7-5) finished in a third-place tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast 70, Rancho Santiago 56 -- Leann Karmeo led Orange Coast (19-12, 
7-5) with 18 points and 17 rebounds. Rancho Santiago finished 3-20, 0-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside 77, Cypress 63 -- Riverside dominated from the beginning with strong 
shooting from Audrey McMurry (22 points). Sara Works had 21 points for Cypress 
(22-9, 7-5), which lost the battle for second in the conference.

EXPORTS TO JAPAN IN JEOPARDY, SAY STATE'S FARMERS; TRADE: SOME LEADERS FEAR 
MEDFLY INFESTATION WILL TIP JAPANESE TOWARD BOYCOTT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With trade tensions intensifying between the United States and Japan, farmers 
in California -- growers of the produce favored by the dreaded Mediterranean 
fruit fly -- are afraid of becoming an easy target in what may become a 
bruising struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 And a new University of California study says if Japan follows through on a 
threat to boycott California produce, it would cost the state's 
export-dependent farm economy dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the recent collapse of trade talks between the two countries, 
Japan was threatening a boycott of the state's produce because of the return of 
the Medfly to parts of California. Just last month, the American Embassy in 
Tokyo was warning Washington of "a very critical situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, aerial spraying has finally begun in Riverside County to kill the 
Medfly, a step Japan had urged. But the general trade climate has worsened 
dramatically, and the state's farm lobby fears a boycott would be seen by the 
Japanese as an effective way to respond to President Clinton's recent trade 
complaint over Japan's treatment of U.S. cellular-phone makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture trade officials in Washington say they consider retaliation 
unlikely, but California farm leaders -- having just won a hard-fought battle 
to ship the state's rice to Japan -- are deeply concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The threat is very real," says Bob Vice, president of the California Farm 
Bureau. "Frankly, we've always known that's the way the Japanese would 
retaliate: in agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a boycott would quickly spread to other Far East nations and trim overall 
farm revenues by $564 million while cutting deeply into the plum and citrus 
business, slashing revenues for Valencia oranges alone by 55%, the UC Berkeley 
study says. 
</P>
<P>
 The short-term result would be sharply lower profits or operating losses for 
growers, shippers and packers, while an embargo of more than two years would 
cause "a significant loss in acres, jobs and assets" for about 20 crops, said 
the report by economist Jerome B. Siebert at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Medfly became established in the state, the total losses could reach 
some $1.4 billion a year because of the Far East boycott and other continuing 
costs of fighting the infestation, the study said. California farmers take in 
about $18 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Siebert said a boycott by Japan is especially worrisome because Korea, Taiwan 
and Hong Kong normally follow Japan's lead in these matters. That could spread 
alarm to other regions and to other parts of the United States, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Rim has swollen in importance to California agriculture, 
especially citrus. Fully 60% of the products sold by Sunkist, the state's giant 
citrus cooperative, are exported to Asia. Japan is Sunkist's biggest single 
export market, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After repeated efforts to block the aerial spraying of the insecticide 
malathion, the spraying began Tuesday over an 18-square-mile area of Corona and 
Norco in Riverside County. American Embassy officials in Japan had been urging 
such action. 
</P>
<P>
 A top official in the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday downplayed the 
likelihood of retaliation as a motive for a Japanese boycott, and said he 
expects no action unless the Medfly spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the trappings (of the pest) are confined to that region, our 
concerns are lessened," said Richard Schroeter, acting administrator of the 
USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service. "The action taken by the state of 
California, the aerial spraying, give us optimism here." 
</P>
<P>
 The specific products that would be affected by an embargo are fresh apples, 
apricots, avocados, bell peppers, sweet cherries, dates, figs, table grapes, 
grapefruit, kiwis, lemons, limes, tangerines, oranges, nectarines, peaches, 
pears, persimmons, plums and tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a third of those California crops were exported in 1992, bringing in 
$605 million, the UC Berkeley study said. More than half that total came from 
Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Impact on California 
</P>
<P>
 Should Japan and other East Asian nations boycott California produce, the 
impact would be devasting for certain crops. Total revenue and expected losses, 
in millions of dollars: 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia oranges: Lost revenue under boycott: $166.2 Total revenue: 299.8 
</P>
<P>
 Lemons: Lost revenue under boycott: 128.6 Total revenue: 334.4 
</P>
<P>
 Grapefruit: Lost revenue under boycott: 82.5 Total revenue: 160.2 
</P>
<P>
 Naval oranges: Lost revenue under boycott: 73.5 Total revenue: 482.5 
</P>
<P>
 Plums and prunes: Lost revenue under boycott: 43.6 Total revenue: 118.4 
</P>
<P>
 Table Grapes: Lost revenue under boycott: 39.3 Total revenue: 578.5 
</P>
<P>
 Kiwi: Lost revenue under boycott: 6.4 Total revenue: 45.0 
</P>
<P>
 Avocados: Lost revenue under boycott: 5.2 Total revenue: 177.1

BOND YIELDS LEAP ON FEARS OF INFLATION, HIGHER INTEREST; MARKETS: SOME 
SOUTHLAND LENDERS RAISE MORTGAGE RATES. BLUE-CHIP PRICES TUMBLE FOR THE SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fears that inflation and interest rates could rise again soon sent bond yields 
soaring Friday to the highest levels since last summer, triggering a modest 
selloff in stocks and prompting some Southern California lenders to raise their 
mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp rise in bond yields -- the second in two days -- puts pressure on 
rates to rise throughout the economy, which could boost the cost of borrowing 
for businesses and consumers and dampen future economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond shot up to 6.63%, the highest since 
last July and up from 6.54% Thursday and 6.48% Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield rise sent blue-chip stocks tumbling for the second session in a row, 
with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 35.18 points to close at 3,887.46. 
For the week, the index was off 7.32 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid rise in interest rates had some veteran traders wondering if the 
bond market's long rally is about to run out of gas. Bond prices fall when 
rates rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to pronounce this the beginning of the bear market," said 
Russell Abbott, a bond trader at First Boston Corp. "But it is exhibiting many 
of the characteristics of bear trading." 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp rise in bond yields was triggered by concerns that the Federal 
Reserve Board may soon raise short-term rates again to keep long-term inflation 
in check. Traders were also still reacting to a report issued Thursday showing 
that some manufacturers are beginning to pay higher prices for raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, traders were gearing up for Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's 
testimony before Congress on Tuesday. (Financial markets will be closed Monday 
for the Presidents' Day holiday.) A few days after Greenspan's last 
congressional appearance, on Jan. 31, the Fed boosted the key federal funds 
rate by a quarter-point and touched off a 96-point drop in the Dow Jones 
industrials. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year bond has risen more than 0.3 percentage points since the Fed 
raised the federal funds rate. Rates on 30-year mortgages were at an average 
6.97% just before the Fed moved. This week, they averaged 7.11%, the Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of Southern California lenders raised their rates on fixed 30-year 
mortgages by about one-eighth of a point on Thursday, and a few more followed 
suit on Friday. Rates now are generally between 7.125% and 7.375%, up from 7% 
about three weeks ago. The latest rate hike would add about $13 to the monthly 
payment on a $150,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Joseph Conrad, a director of the Los Angeles County Assn. of Mortgage 
Brokers, said the rate hike probably had more to do with the arrival of a 
three-day weekend than with the selloff in the bond market. Most financial 
institutions will be closed Monday for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some lenders raise their rates a little at the start of a three-day weekend, 
just to give themselves a little protection in case something happens before 
they reopen on Tuesday," said Conrad, a broker and president of the Spectrum 
Group in Woodland Hills. "Rates might go back down a little next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most economists say mortgage rates will climb at least a quarter-point 
and perhaps more than half a point by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still believe the trend is for rates to rise, though slightly over the 
course of the year," said Robert Van Order, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corp.'s chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
 As for stocks, their outlook will depend in part on how much further rates 
will rise, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 A.C. Moore, stock market analyst at SBCM/Argus, said interest rates would have 
to move a half to a full percentage point higher before having an impact on 
what he described as stocks' primary positive trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interest rates can go up a good bit more before that becomes a problem," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues beat advances 1,412 to 702 on New York 
Stock Exchange volume of more than 289 million shares. The Nasdaq Stock Market 
composite index slid 1.39 to 788.85 but gained 7.46 in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Economically sensitive cyclical stocks, which have rallied recently on the 
view they will benefit most from the economy's expansion, lost ground. Among 
cyclical stocks, Chrysler shed 3/4 to 57 7/8, Caterpillar dropped 5/8 to 108 
1/8 and Whirlpool was off 7/8 to 68 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scripps-Howard shot up 7 to 82 after E.W. Scripps offered to buy the 14% of 
the company's stock it did not already own. E.W. Scripps offered three of its 
class A common shares for each Scripps-Howard share. E.W. Scripps ended off 1/8 
to 28 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shares in Mexican telecommunications company Telefonos de Mexico dropped 2 
1/4 to 71 3/8, topping the NYSE's most active list. Traders pinned the drop to 
investors' concern about declines in world stock markets and profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's Financial Times 100 index ended down 42.7 points at 
3,382.6. Frankfurt's DAX index closed at 2,151.97, up 1.09% or 23.25 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's Nikkei average finished 28.21 points, or 0.15%, higher at 18,959.60 
but showed a loss of 1,031.1 points since last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar fell against most European currencies amid disappointment in its 
failure to sustain a rally earlier in the week on news of a German rate cut. 
The dollar was quoted at 1.7133 marks in late New York trading, down from 
1.7265 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar managed to post a minor gain against the yen after Japanese 
officials said they plan steps to make markets more open to U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold plunged, leading other metals lower. Traders said a plunge in bond 
prices, potential violence in South Africa, and faltering trade talks in Japan 
have all failed to spark new demand for gold. Gold bullion fell $2.70 on New 
York's Commodity Exchange, where the most-active April contract settled at 
$381.60 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy futures prices were mostly higher Friday in very light trading ahead 
of the three-day weekend. Light sweet crude oil for delivery in March settled 
at $14.21 per barrel, down 2 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

BARGAIN CENTRAL; DEVELOPERS PROPOSE HUGE OUTLET MALLS IN URBAN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, factory outlet malls have stuck to out-of-the way places like 
Cabazon and Barstow, where manufacturers can sell their wares without 
alienating full-price retailers clustered in regional shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 A few like The Citadel, which opened in 1990 in City of Commerce, have popped 
up in urban areas as manufacturers tested the outlet concept, but they were the 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a handful of off-price centers are being proposed that could put hundreds 
of factory outlets and discount retail stores in the very heart of urban Orange 
and Los Angeles counties, potentially changing the way Southern Californians 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 An East Coast developer is betting that it can resuscitate The City Mall, a 
struggling regional center in Orange that for years has lost customers and 
merchants to newer malls nearby. Mills Corp., a privately held company based in 
Washington, already has four outlet malls -- in Fort Lauderdale, Chicago, 
Philadelphia and suburban Washington -- that together generate $1 billion in 
annual sales and include Nordstrom, Bugle Boy, Sharper Image and Ann Taylor 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, which proposes transforming The City Mall into a million-square-foot 
center with 12 anchor stores and 169 specialty shops, also wants to build an 
outlet mall in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 And Century City developer Robert Sonnenblick plans to build a pair of "value 
outlet super malls" of 1.2 million square feet each in Carson and Colton. The 
Carson City Council in December approved a plan to help finance Sonnenblick's 
LA Metro Mall, which would be at the interchange of the San Diego and Harbor 
freeways. The center is to include half a dozen anchor stores, hundreds of 
outlet shops and a massive food court. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics from Value Retail News, a trade publication, indicate that U.S. 
consumers are hungry for bargains. While conventional retailing stalled during 
the recession, sales at outlet stores grew to $8.3 billion in 1992, up 12% from 
$7.4 billion the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail industry experts say that value-oriented outlet centers can succeed 
even in areas already awash in malls. "We're going to see an increasing mix of 
different kinds of malls," said Linda Crowley, an Irvine-based retail industry 
consultant. "And the consumer will be the winner, with better prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Outlet centers aren't for everyone. Harried shoppers seeking a specific item 
-- say, size 38 Calvin Klein underwear -- probably will stick with the 
convenience of well-stocked stores in regional shopping malls. Outlet centers 
cater to consumers who have time to spare and are looking for an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an entertaining day," said Courtney Lord, a Washington-based mall 
developer who is building centers in San Jose and Seattle. "You'll find brand 
names at great prices. But you'll have to work at your purchases and be willing 
to accept substitutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The new centers aren't going to drive well-established malls out of business, 
developers say. Consumers think of their neighborhood malls "sort of like your 
Main Street," Lord said. "You're in and out of them maybe 40 or 50 times each 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, only the hardiest shoppers make more than two or three trips a 
year to the outlet centers. "Instead of running in for a half hour at your 
regional mall and spending 30 bucks, you'll spend three hours and 400 bucks," 
Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some retail analysts doubt that even heavily populated Southern California 
can support more than two or three outlet malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Orange and Carson proposals already face obstacles. Mills Corp. says 
in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it intends to 
finance The City Mall project with funds generated by a real estate investment 
trust. But the SEC documents show that the company lost money in each of the 
past four years and, like many developers, has a heavy debt load. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers note that Mills has yet to begin work on a similar mall 
that it proposed in the late 1980s for Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carson center, which developer Sonnenblick says will open by 1996, is to 
be built on a 76-acre landfill that's contaminated with heavy metals and 
solvents. Carson officials, eager for the $3 million in annual sales tax 
receipts that the outlet mall is expected to generate, approved a plan to help 
Sonnenblick pay for the cleanup. But the developer has yet to submit a plan to 
the state Department of Toxic Control. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who think new giant off-price centers can thrive question whether 
the Orange and Carson sites are right. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we think there's a place for outlet malls, whether or not these 
locations will work has yet to be determined," said Jan M. Wohlwend, general 
manager of Anaheim Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Plaza briefly considered converting to an outlet center but abandoned 
the idea after determining that "top-of-the-line outlets wouldn't want to 
locate so close to existing regional malls," Wohlwend said. Instead, Anaheim 
Plaza is rebuilding itself as a so-called power center with stores like of 
Wal-Mart, Comp USA and Ross, which offer name brands at cut-rate prices. 
Developer Lord, a strong proponent of outlet malls, acknowledges that the 
outlet-center concept is evolving. "We're still writing the book on how to get 
merchandise to consumers for less," he said. But consumers, he said, "want us 
to give them more for less, and this is one way to do it."

CREDIT CARD WAR ERUPTS AT OLYMPICS; ADVERTISING: IOC ACCUSES AMERICAN EXPRESS 
CO. OF 'AMBUSH MARKETING' IN CAMPAIGN AIMED AT RIVAL VISA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The International Olympic Committee lashed out Friday at American Express Co., 
accusing the company of being a parasite at the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument over what the IOC called "ambush marketing" stems from an 
American Express television commercial promoting the availability of its 
services in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 A voice-over says: "So if you're traveling to Norway, you'll need a passport 
but you don't need a Visa." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad angered both the IOC and rival company Visa, which is an official 
Olympic sponsor with exclusive rights to provide credit card services at Games 
venues. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express was giving a misleading impression it had an Olympic 
connection and had refused to withdraw the ad campaign, the IOC said. The 
committee said it would allow Visa to retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the fifth successive Olympic Games in which American Express has 
falsely implied such a connection," said IOC executive board member Dick Pound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, it appears to be American Express corporate policy, 
deliberately established at the highest level, to try to appropriate the 
goodwill of the Olympics without in any way supporting them. 
</P>
<P>
 "American Express does no service to itself, to its members, to athletes and 
the American public by pretending to hide behind customer service during a 
blatant parasite campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 American Express responded by saying the IOC was engaged in a campaign of 
intimidation and vowed it would not bow to what it said were empty threats. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express spokesman Frank Vaccaro said in Lillehammer that the company 
was countering its rival's campaign to lead the public to believe only Visa 
cards could be used at the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Visa's advertising suggested only its cards would be accepted at the Olympics, 
whereas American Express was welcomed at virtually all hotels, restaurants and 
tourist shops in Lillehammer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "American Express does not require permission from Visa or the IOC to serve 
our card members or to let them know we are present in Norway," he said. "We 
have been in Norway since 1916 and operate customer services throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "A $40-million sponsorship payment by Visa to the IOC will not change that," 
he said. "Visa's purchase of the Olympic rings is not a license to mislead 
consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaccaro said American Express advertising used no Olympic symbols or imagery 
nor did it depict any sports events. 
</P>
<P>
 Visa Senior Vice President John Bennett said in a statement: "Visa stands by 
the accuracy of our advertising. Visa is the only card accepted at the 1994 
Olympic Winter Games." 
</P>
<P>
 IOC Marketing Director Michael Payne said he believed American Express, a 
former Olympic sponsor, was regretting ending its connection with the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're feeling the pinch on sponsorship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said there had been other examples of ambush marketing at the Games. He 
said a third credit card company, Mastercard, had withdrawn 200,000 maps of the 
Olympic region. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota Motor Corp. stopped an ad in Australia suggesting it supported the 
Australian team in Lillehammer after the country's Olympic committee got a 
court injunction, he added.

STRANGE SONY-PETERS PARTNERSHIP REACHES AN END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a rocky five-year marriage that cost hundreds of millions of dollars, 
Sony Pictures Entertainment has given producer Jon Peters his freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony announced Friday that Peters will be allowed to work at other studios 
under a new, non-exclusive deal. The mercurial producer, who never fit into the 
corporate culture at Sony, is widely expected to go back to Warner Bros., where 
he scored his biggest hit with "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, 46, declined comment on his plans Friday. But a return to Warner would 
be seen as ironic, since Sony fought an expensive legal battle with the studio 
to obtain Peters and his former partner, Peter Guber, as co-chairmen in 1989. 
Sony paid more than $500 million in penalties to Warner for making the deal 
while Guber and Peters were still under contract there. In addition to that, it 
paid about $200 million for Guber Peters Entertainment Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about Peters returning to his old stomping ground reportedly 
complicated his exit talks. Sony had no comment on Friday, beyond a terse press 
release in which it said Peters will remain a "special and important member of 
its creative family." Sources expect the studio to go ahead with such 
high-profile Peters projects as "Money Train," possibly starring Wesley Snipes 
and Woody Harrelson, and "Gangland," based on the life of John Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the 12-member staff of Peters Entertainment will remain Sony-based. 
Peters also is on good terms with Guber and Mark Canton, chairman of 
Columbia-TriStar Motion Pictures Companies. 
</P>
<P>
 His departure ends one of Hollywood's strangest partnerships. Much of the 
entertainment community was stunned when Sony Corp., the Japanese electronics 
giant, named Peters and Guber co-chairmen after buying the studio for $3.4 
billion plus sizable debt. While Guber had executive experience, Peters was 
mostly known for his creative skills, having co-produced such hits as "Missing" 
and "Rain Man," in addition to the enormously successful "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
 As a former hairdresser and boyfriend of Barbra Streisand, Peters also had a 
reputation for being tight with talent -- counting Michael Jackson and Jack 
Nicholson among his close friends -- and for having a hair-trigger temper when 
it came to protecting his interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony tried to put a good face on its decision, even after the messy legal 
entanglement with Warner. But Peters never found his niche as an executive. He 
feuded frequently with Sony brass over everything from his ambitious movie 
ideas to his desire to build a Sony theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Things reached an impasse by 1991, when Sony announced that Guber would become 
sole chairman, with Peters accepting a production deal. While Peters 
subsequently spent about $15 million developing "Gangland" and other 
high-profile projects, nothing reached fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 One project, "Mistress of the Seas," fell apart over financial and creative 
disagreements. Others never moved forward. Sources say Peters was frustrated by 
Sony's cautious attitude toward spending, especially in the wake of flops such 
as "Last Action Hero." He also remained embittered about his earlier 
experiences, friends say. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came there to run the company, not to make movies," said one source. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters is expected to spend the next several months lining up financing to 
support his new production company. Rumors that he will rejoin Warner are also 
fueled by the fact that he's very friendly with Warner Bros. President Terry 
Semel. But sources say nothing has been formally decided, since Peters 
apparently wants to get back into filmmaking in a big way.

OFF THE TICKER: ZAPPING ADS INTO 8 SECONDS OF BLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Iggulden of Santa Clarita had a tired fast-forward finger. So he 
invented a device, set to hit stores in June, to zap advertising from 
videotaped television programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The price: $199 for the box called Commercial Break that hooks up to VCRs, 
said Richard Leifer, president of manufacturer Arista Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Iggulden's device lets a VCR record a program, then makes a map of where the 
ads are. You play back the tape, and the device fast-forwards the ads. All you 
see is eight seconds of blue screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony isn't lost on Leifer. "When sales go up," he said, "we'll actually 
run a television commercial for a product that gets rid of television 
commercials."

 Intel Increases Its Share of the Chip Market: The Santa Clara company 
controlled 73% of worldwide sales of microprocessors in 1993, up from 69% the 
year before, according to research firm Dataquest. Motorola, expected to be an 
even stronger rival this year, moved into second place with 8% of the market, 
and Advanced Micro Devices, which makes a version of the Intel line of "86" 
chips, fell to third place and a 6% share.

 Group Makes Offer for America West: Air Partners, the investor group that 
brought Continental Airlines Inc. out of bankruptcy court, has made an offer 
for America West Airlines, a spokesman for the group said.In addition, 
Continental and the New Mexico-based regional carrier Mesa Airlines are said to 
be considering joining in the bid. Investors David Bonderman and James Coulter 
of Fort Worth, Tex., formed Air Partners last year and joined with Air Canada 
to bail out Continental in return for a majority stake. A spokesman for Air 
Partners said the offer already has expired, but the investors group said it is 
still interested. Continental and Mesa would be minority investors in America 
West.

 Viacom, Blockbuster May Revise Merger Terms: Viacom Inc. and Blockbuster 
Entertainment Corp. may revise the terms of their merger agreement in the wake 
of declining stock values of both companies. Wall Street analysts said the 
value of the Viacom-Blockbuster merger has declined to $5 billion from $8.4 
billion when the merger was announced last month, forcing both companies back 
to the negotiating table.Blockbuster's stock has tumbled nearly 40%. 
Blockbuster shareholders are expected to pressure Viacom to sweeten its offer, 
and may possibly recruit TV broadcaster Chris-Craft Industries to buy 
Blockbuster shares in exchange for some of the merged companies' assets. 
Blockbuster is part of a three-way merger with Viacom, which just won the 
five-month-long takeover battle for Paramount Communications.

 Sega Forecasts Profit Decline: Sega Enterprises, the aggressive Japanese video 
game maker that eclipsed archrival Nintendo Co. in the U.S. market last year, 
forecast its first drop in profits in 12 years.It cited the soaring yen, the 
recession in Europe and intensified competition in its home market. Those 
factors, combined spwith heavy spending to develop theme parks, advanced 
computer game machines and electronic toys, will probably cause its earnings in 
the fiscal year ending March 31 to fall to $408 millio9n, off nearly 23% from 
$529 million last year. It had previously forecast profits of $552 million.

PAC BELL: BUZZ THROUGH OR BUZZ OFF

<P>
 For the person who only wants to talk to some of the people some of the time, 
Pacific Bell has introduced a call-blocking service called "Do Not Disturb." 
</P>
<P>
 The service allows customers to block calls from people who don't know a 
prearranged four-letter password.If callers know the password, the call goes 
through. If not, they're told to call back later or leave a message at the 
beep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Participants use their home phones to change their password and turn the 
service on or off just as often as they like," said Jennifer Brunn of Pacific 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is currently letting about 200 customers in Southern California 
try the service out for free as part of a trial. If the trial goes as expected, 
Pacific Bell plans to offer "Do Not Disturb" for about $3.50 to $4.00 a month.

 Blinder Top Candidate for Fed Post: Alan Blinder, a member of President 
Clinton's economic brain trust and former Princeton University economist, is 
the leading candidate to take the No. 2 post at the Federal Reserve, 
Administration officials said.The position at the powerful central bank 
unexpectedly opened up early this month with the departure of David Mullins. 
Blinder, 48, has served the past year on the White House's Council of Economic 
Advisers. As Fed vice chairman, Blinder would play a major role in determining 
the direction of interest rates and the economy and would de facto be a top 
candidate to take over as head of the central bank when Alan Greenspan's term 
ends in 1996.

 The Justice Department said it won't object to plans by a Bay Area coalition 
of big employers to negotiate jointly for the purchase of health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans by the Bay Area Business Group on Health to form a health care 
purchasing cooperative are a preview of the type of large buying alliances 
envisioned by President Clinton's health care reform plan. But a growing number 
of businesses across the country are moving ahead of health care reform to form 
health care buying groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department's decision to not challenge the Bay Area group's plan 
"provides impetus for other employers to do the same," said Patricia Powers, 
executive director of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group's members include 19 public and private businesses, such 
as Bank of America, Chevron Corp. and Pacific Gas & Electric. The group plans 
to negotiate directly with health maintenance organizations for coverage for 
employees, dependents and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 The group had asked the Justice Department last fall for a formal opinion on 
whether its health care buying consortium would violate antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1989, the Bay Area group is among a small but growing number of 
employer health care purchasing cooperatives in cities such as 
Minneapolis-St.Paul. Most of the other groups include mostly small or 
medium-size businesses, said Powers, while the Bay Area group includes some of 
the state's biggest employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, its members account for $3 billion in annual health care spending 
and provide coverage for 2.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers said the coalition "is not just trying to beat on the (health) plans 
and say 'Give us a great price.' " The group has also worked to establish 
standard HMO benefits packages, customer satisfaction surveys and guidelines 
for preventing disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The buying consortium would seek bids from HMOs to provide coverage beginning 
in 1995. Not all of the 19 members would participate during the first year. For 
example, the group includes the giant California Public Employees Retirement 
System, which recently completed negotiations for member health coverage for 
its 1995 contract year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the Bay Area group include the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco, McKesson Corp., Mervyn's, Pacific Telesis Group, Safeway Stores and 
Wells Fargo Bank, among others.

 Galoob Wins Video Lawsuit Appeal: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 
that Lewis Galoob Toys is entitled to a $15-million bond posted by Nintendo of 
America after a lower court judge ruled that Galoob's Game Genie video game 
enhancer had not infringed Nintendo's copyright.The $15 million represents 
profits lost to Galoob, based in South San Francisco, because of an injunction 
blocking Galoob for a time from selling Game Genie. A lower court judge had 
ruled that Galoob was wrongfully enjoined from selling the video-game 
attachment. Nintendo said it would appeal the latest ruling.

VEGAS GALA SHAPES UP AS A JACKSON FAMILY GAMBLE; BENEFIT: SLOW TICKET SALES 
FORCE PRICE CUTS, WHILE MICHAEL'S ROLE IN TONIGHT'S SHOW IS MINIMAL. SOME MONEY 
IS EARMARKED FOR CHARITIES. 
</P>

<P>
 When announced last summer, NBC's "The Jackson Family Honors" was shaping up 
as a massive charity gala featuring a rare live TV performance by Michael 
Jackson. It was to be staged in Atlantic City in December. 
</P>
<P>
 With the concert finally on tap tonight in Las Vegas, much of the sheen has 
rubbed off: 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite indications as late as last week by executive producer Jermaine 
Jackson that his brother would perform a solo number on the show, Michael's 
press representative announced Wednesday that it won't happen. Michael will 
simply sing one song with the family and present humanitarian awards to 
Elizabeth Taylor and Motown Records founder Berry Gordy. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the same 12,000-seat MGM Grand Hotel arena where Barbra Streisand 
recently sold out two shows in less than an hour, tickets were still remaining 
for the two-hour TV taping as of Friday morning. The slow sales are why prices 
on thousands of mid-level tickets were cut Wednesday from $350 to $150, sources 
said. Other tickets range from $50 to $1,000 for special charity packages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Though the "musical benefit" could garner up to $6 million in TV broadcast 
fees and ticket revenues if the concert sells out, only $500,000 is formally 
pledged to charities not controlled by the Jacksons. The remaining $5.5 million 
would be paid to a Jackson Family nonprofit foundation -- never mentioned in 
the concert's ads -- to cover production costs, including expenses incurred 
when the show had to be moved from Atlantic City to Las Vegas, organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hopes for corporate sponsorships to underwrite the cost of the production 
vanished after Michael Jackson was accused by a 13-year-old boy last August of 
sexual molestation. The corporate sponsorship figure once being bounced around 
in the industry was $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge for me was to just make it happen," said Jermaine Jackson, 
executive producer of the show and president of Jackson Communications Inc., 
the corporation staging the event. "It was a major challenge just to overcome 
all the obstacles. Even now, we're still putting out fires." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC will air the MGM Grand Garden arena show on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The event marks Michael Jackson's first formal stage appearance since cutting 
short a world concert tour in November because of a drug addiction he said 
stemmed partially from dealing with the molestation claims. The entertainer 
denied the allegations, but reportedly paid more than $10 million last month to 
settle a lawsuit filed by the boy. No criminal charges have been lodged against 
the singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's sister Janet and brother Jermaine will perform solo and the Jackson 
5 (minus Michael) are expected to stage a number stocked with 29 Jackson 
relatives, including mom and pop Katherine and Joe Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 LaToya Jackson, who has claimed she and her siblings grew up in an abusive 
household and who publicly has questioned brother Michael's sexual behavior, is 
not expected to attend. Other musical guests scheduled to perform include 
Gladys Knight, Smokey Robinson and Celine Dion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was most important to bring the family together to help the less fortunate 
in the world," Jermaine Jackson said. "The idea behind this whole thing is to 
give back. It's a charitable event. We're not getting paid for this. It's been 
a long process and it's been worth it all." 
</P>
<P>
 The executive producer said "net proceeds" from the event will be donated to 
the Permanent Charities Committee of the Entertainment Industry, a Studio 
City-based 52-year-old fund-raising arm of the show business community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is for Permanent Charities Committee to distribute a maximum $500,000 
donation, mostly for California earthquake relief, to Northridge Medical 
Center, St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, the American Red Cross and the 
Salvation Army, with lesser amounts earmarked for the Friends of Conservation 
and the Library of Congress' American Popular Music Program. 
</P>
<P>
 If the show sells out, concert promoters speculate that the 12,000 tickets 
could generate an estimated $2.5 million. Representatives for the Jacksons said 
the family's firm already has secured an additional $3.5 million in broadcast 
fees from NBC in the United States and 25 other stations around the world. The 
company could generate more revenue if successful in marketing the show to 
other countries after it airs next week. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Jackson camp said that if the show sells out, 
approximately $5.5 million would be paid to Jackson Jubilee Inc., a New 
Jersey-based nonprofit group, to cover the administrative and production costs 
of putting on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for the family said that Jackson Jubilee was incorporated under New 
Jersey law on Nov. 8, 1993, and that applications have been filed for nonprofit 
status. The Internal Revenue Service, the New Jersey Charities Registration 
Office and the California Registry of Charitable Trusts have no record of the 
group on file. 
</P>
<P>
 Undisclosed portions of the $5.5 million will be paid to Jackson 
Communications Inc., a family corporation, and Gary Smith, the Emmy-winning 
producer behind the 200-person, $3-million production, as well as to TWI, a New 
York agency that negotiated the international broadcast fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for the Jacksons said no one in the family will make money on 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The "Jackson Family Honors" was originally scheduled for taping in Atlantic 
City on Dec. 11 to be broadcast as an NBC special on Jan. 10. Corporate 
sponsors that expressed interest last year in financing the project dropped out 
after Michael Jackson disappeared and reportedly checked into a London 
drug-treatment clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is being produced by Jackson Communications Inc. The company, based 
in Iselin, N.J., was formed by Jermaine, his parents and real estate attorney 
Robert Petrallia in 1991 to pursue the possible development of an 
entertainment-oriented urban-renewal project in Asbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, which is reportedly involved in real estate and talent management, 
negotiated a six-year deal last April with NBC to broadcast the award show 
annually, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company was set up to give the (Jackson) family an opportunity to develop 
a dynastic quality very much in the tradition of the Rockefellers and the 
Vanderbilts," said Petrallia, who is JCI's chairman and chief executive 
officer. "But it also has a very big interest in participating in activities 
that improve the quality of life around the world. Virtually every project we 
do has some nonprofit aspect to it." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC officials said that when the licensing agreement was first reached between 
the network and Jackson Communications last summer, the event was designed 
strictly as an entertainment special. It was only after the plans were under 
way that the Jacksons decided to turn the event into a benefit, network 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The network added that it researched the listed charities to verify that they 
were legitimate, but that NBC is not involved in the distribution of the funds 
to those charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Reportedly, the controversy surrounding Michael Jackson and the other members 
of the family has not impaired commercial sales for the TV show. The show was 
nearly sold out as of late last week. Major advertisers such as MCI, 
Volkswagen, General Foods and Procter & Gamble bought time at the rate of 
$130,000 per 30 seconds, which is about average for this kind of programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't ignore the adverse publicity, but this is one of these situations 
that you look at from a client-by-client situation," said Douglas Seay, senior 
vice president of national broadcast for Hal Riney & Associates, a New 
York-based agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay said he was considering buying time on the special for clients: "As a 
package, this show makes for good counter-programming for the Olympics. There's 
an automatic interest factor, not unlike a tawdry soap opera."

staff writers John Lippman and James Bates also contributed to this story.

A RETURN TO THE SCENE OF CONQUEST; MAJOR NORMAN EXHIBITION OPENS IN ROME 910 
YEARS AFTER VIKING INVASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Exactly 910 years after they came to pillage this city, the heirs of fierce 
Viking pirates have returned to enchant it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1084, the Northmen sacked parts of the Eternal City in a terror campaign of 
conquest that included Southern Italy and Sicily, which they ruled for two 
centuries. Now they have returned as "The Normans, People of Europe," in a 
groundbreaking exhibition that is drawing enthusiastic crowds to the Palazzo 
Venezia in the heart of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first major Norman exhibition, and we will have succeeded if it 
makes the people of a united Europe realize that they are not products of one 
single culture but of many," said Mario D'Onofrio, organizer of the exhibition 
that will remain in Rome through April, then move to Venice's Palazzo Ducale 
from mid-May until September. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Onofrio, a professor of medieval art at Rome University, spent six years 
assembling a show of intriguing glimpses of a warrior race better known across 
the centuries as conquerors than for their prowess as builders and governors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The result is engrossing, if uneven -- tools, weapons, clothing, jewelry, 
1,000-year-old shoes for small horses, knights' armor, scale models and 
manuscripts. The works are drawn from collections in 11 countries, including 
pieces from museums in New York and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition was assembled with the support of patrons, including the 
presidents of France and Italy and the Queen of England. All three countries 
once feared the Northmen's tread. Vikings sweeping down from what is now 
Scandinavia rooted themselves in Northern France. They learned French, adopted 
Catholicism and rowed across the Channel under William the Conqueror to 
vanquish England. 
</P>
<P>
 They then marched south through the Holy Roman Empire and around it by sea. 
They sent armed expeditions down to the shores of North Africa, and east as far 
as Antioch and Ankara. They mounted the Crusades under knights such as 
England's King Richard I, known as the Lion-Hearted. 
</P>
<P>
 With that as background, note that Rome's thoughtful new exhibition is not for 
the jet-lagged. There is much to absorb. 
</P>
<P>
 The show -- predictably -- opens stressing the Norman's war-tossed ascendancy. 
There are dented war helmets, lovingly hewn battle axes and swords, spurs and 
chain-mail armor that passed reverently from father to son -- all tools of the 
invaders' trade in the mid-11th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition is organized topically. But there is an element of eclecticism. 
One portion focuses on a medical school in Salerno founded under Norman rule by 
the Jew Helinus, the Greek Pontus, the Arab Adela and the Latin Salernus; it 
survived into the 19th Century. Replicas of 1,000-year-old surgeons' and 
dentists' tools -- gruesome drills, saws, pliers, knives -- will, uh, make you 
glad you floss. 
</P>
<P>
 Spare a moment for the forest as you stroll among the Norman trees. The 
Palazzo Venezia, built partially of stones from the nearby Colosseum, was the 
first Renaissance palace in Rome. It was the palace of Popes, the Venetian 
Embassy and, in this century, the headquarters-cum-balcony for Fascist dictator 
Benito Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
 One crowd-stopping Norman work in the breathtaking museum-palace is a 
six-meter square diorama, painstakingly detailed and historically accurate: 
1,600 painted, lead soldiers nervously await trumpet's blare to begin the 
Battle of Hastings, which sealed Norman victory over England in 1066. 
</P>
<P>
 That and other Norman triumphs are also portrayed in a reproduction of a long 
segment of the Bayeux Tapestry -- the 11th-Century's anticipation of the modern 
comic book -- a bloody narration of Norman prowess in battle which, legend has 
it, was stitched with the help of William's wife, Queen Matilda. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more to the Normans than war. While that is the least-known part 
of their story, it is perhaps the most alluring part of the exhibition. "In 
marching across England, France and Italy, they created a territorial, 
juridical and cultural unity that in some cases survived into the 19th 
Century," D'Onofrio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Normans -- militant Christians who defended the Pope and sprang forth as 
Crusaders in vain attempts to conquer the Holy Land -- never cultivated the 
arts. But they did establish some of their era's best governments, 
systematizing feudalism and introducing stability as remedy to Medieval 
anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 They also were remarkable architects: Scale-models feature their fortified 
towns, their high-towered defensive castles (like the Tower of London) and 
their splendid cathedrals. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman churches are still European landmarks in places as diverse as 
Winchester, England; Caen, France, and in Sicily, where the Norman style melded 
with Arab and Byzantine to produce masterpieces like the cathedral of Monreale. 
</P>
<P>
 (Here in Rome, the Normans built fires, not buildings. In fact, the burn marks 
of their sack are still visible at the ancient basilica of the Santissimi 
Coronati, titular church of Los Angeles' Cardinal Roger Mahony.) 
</P>
<P>
 Norman King Roger II wore a gorgeous red and gold silk coronation cape in 1130 
to become the first king of Sicily; his soldiers wagered on dice forged from a 
stag's horn. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are there -- the cape a striking reproduction -- in engaging sections of 
the show that examine the bric-a-brac of daily and ceremonial life and death: 
marble statues and capitals, illuminated Bibles, coins, brooches, cups, 
reliquaries, mosaics, stained glass, household implements and terra cotta jars 
for storing oil and grain. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition also includes an ambitious but unconvincing multimedia 
introduction to the Normans, and -- change of pace -- a high-tech salon where 
the Normans and their civilization come to life from press-the-screen 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 * "I Normanni, Popolo d' Europa," is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., 
8:30 p.m. on weekends, in Palazzo Venezia at the Piazza Venezia in the center 
of Rome until April 30. Admission is about $6. The same exhibition reopens at 
Palazzo Ducale in Venice on May 20 until Sept. 17.

A STREETWISE LATINO BEAMS HIS MESSAGE; RADIO: ON KPCC-FM'S 'SANCHO SHOW,' 
COLLEGE ASSOCIATE DEAN DANIEL CASTRO USES BARRIO VERNACULAR TO URGE HIS 
LISTENERS TO GET AN EDUCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On a cold Saturday night at KPCC-FM (89.3), the Pasadena City College radio 
station, a silvery-haired disc jockey sits hunched over a microphone and 
launches into an odd form of rap found nowhere else on the FM dial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here on the airwaves of Aztlan, that's A-Z-T-L-A-N," he says. "You 
don't know what that means? Look it up! Naaah, it ain't in the dictionary, man, 
it's too hip to be in the dictionary. Go to the library and tell 'em Sancho 
sent you, and they'll even let you use the books for free! I know you don't 
believe it, but it's true! Libraries are free! So jog your mind, La Raza, jog 
your mind!" 
</P>
<P>
 The language is calo , the vernacular of the barrio; the music is all Latino 
and the attitude is street. It's Sancho's message that comes as a surprise: Get 
an education and be an asset to La Raza, your Chicano people, or drop out and 
be a loser. Aztlan, the Promised Land of Aztec mythology, is within reach of 
those who educate themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 10 years on KPCC, "The Sancho Show" has become a cult event, boasting 
an estimated 20,000 listeners, dozens of fan clubs across Southern California 
and a die-hard, mainly Eastside following that tunes in to see what madness 
Sancho and his crew -- engineer Mary Martin and associate producer Richard 
(Riche) Barron -- will cook up from 6 to 10 p.m. each week. 
</P>
<P>
 As Martin and Barron scurry to and fro keeping the show on course, Sancho 
riffs on everything from tortillas and "Monie" girls (from Ramona Convent) to 
"Mary's cool car with the tiger-skin seat covers." He fills his patter with 
inside jokes aimed at friends and family. While careless listeners complain 
that the program is a "cholo show" -- run by what sounds like a dropout from 
the barrio -- his fans recognize it as a celebration of Mexican American 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, Sancho is Daniel Castro, Ph.D., associate dean of student 
activities at East Los Angeles College, former prison educator and reformer, 
one-time real estate developer and longtime education crusader. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the top level, we're playing some music and having fun," says Castro, 49, 
who does his disc jockeying for free. "But the bottom line," he says, is that 
"we're here to educate. The day I quit educating people, I'll be gone." 
</P>
<P>
 If he feels like talking calo , he does. "The hook is to get people to laugh, 
and to understand that I have a choice (in how he speaks)," Castro explains. 
For every "Spanglish" street expression he uses, he says, he's sure to 
construct a sentence that makes it clear he's a home boy with an education. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he's hooked listeners, Castro's goal is to build pride in their Mexican 
American heritage and get them to go to school. (Because he is Chicano himself, 
Castro aims the program at other English-speaking Mexican Americans, but other 
Latinos and whites are welcome.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I started listening in April, and it's become a religious observance," says 
Sancho fan Corina Carrasco, 37, who has come by the station to donate to a 
Sancho-sponsored canned-food drive and to look over the Sancho T-shirts and 
memorabilia being sold for scholarship money. "I like the music but, most of 
all, I like Sancho's manner. I like it when he asks people to call and vote on 
songs, or what kind of chicharrones they like. He's a real person." 
</P>
<P>
 The show was created 10 years ago when Castro, then working in real estate, 
and some of his colleagues on the Pasadena Scholarship Committee set out to 
figure out why the dropout rate among Mexican Americans was so high. Along the 
way, the committee found that 70% of the information young Latinos were getting 
was from the radio, so Castro decided that the best way to reach at-risk kids 
was through a radio program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sancho Show" started out as a temporary gig, one hour a week, but it 
gradually lengthened and took hold. Now, as an outgrowth, Castro organizes the 
annual Chicano Music Awards and has just issued a "Best of Sancho" CD, both to 
raise money for scholarships. He sponsors everything from canned food drives 
for fire victims, to a "burrito brigade" to feed earthquake victims, to a Cinco 
de Mayo 5-K run around the Rose Bowl that ends with a feast of menudo, chorizo 
and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro's alter ego, Sancho, was born the first night of the show. Castro and 
his then-partner, Jesse Gomez, Pasadena City College's track coach, had planned 
to talk about a fictional student named Sancho. Ten seconds before they went on 
the air, Castro recalls, "Jesse looks at me and said, 'You know what? There's 
no use in having two nervous people in here,' and got up and walked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro tried playing himself and talking about Sancho, but by the end of the 
show decided it would be easier simply to play the part of Sancho himself. The 
Sancho character is "someone that's in everyone's family," Castro explains, 
"just happy-go-lucky, having a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 The content of the show varies each week. Between tunes from the Pistoleros of 
Merced, Los Rock Angels and Thee Midniters, Castro's 16-year-old daughter, 
Tonantzin, might guest-star, playing the part of Giant Gretchen from the Glow 
Girls Gorgeous Latinas of Wrassling. On other shows, visitors ranging from 
youngsters who want to learn radio to community activists, musicians, authors 
and educators drop in to chat with Sancho about upcoming projects or community 
lore. 
</P>
<P>
 In one on-air bit, Castro jokes about the "Marrano Beach Club," referring to a 
stream near a former pig ranch in what is now the Whittier Narrows Recreation 
Facility, where Mexican American parents -- including his own -- used to take 
their children to play. Reviving the memory of a bygone community hangout is 
"keeping the culture alive," he says. Now, he says, parents take their kids to 
the site to learn about a piece of Mexican American history. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Pasadena, Castro's interest in education took him through 
UC Santa Barbara, Occidental College, a brief stint at USC law school and to 
Union Graduate School, where he earned a doctorate in sociology. He taught 
Chicano studies at the Terminal Island prison, worked for the bureau of prisons 
in Washington and then spent several years in Sacramento writing prison reform 
legislation. He returned to Pasadena and ran unsuccessfully for the state 
Assembly, then worked in real estate development for a while before arriving at 
East L.A. College in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first two years of the (radio) program, no one knew who Sancho was," 
Castro says. But his anonymity eventually withered. Now he's famous enough that 
at East L.A. College, he jokes, "Half the kids call me Sancho, the other half 
call me Dr. Castro."CASTRO, DANIEL (

O.C. COMEDY REVIEW; IT'S GARRY SHANDLING'S GRAMMY WARM-UP; PERFORMER DELIVERS A 
DISJOINTED ACT IN IRVINE, BUT APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND AS HE 
PREPARES TO HOST AWARDS SHOW.

 After a three-year absence from performing stand-up in front of alive 
audience, it's understandable that Garry Shandling's rhythm would be a little 
off. But how does he explain his inability to finish a sentence or hold a 
thought, much less weave together a story, which is the comic's general style? 
</P>
<P>
 Running roughshod as he did over stand-up comedy's basic tenets (the same way 
he does on TV), Shandling's personality, disarming smile, banter and material 
kept the show from turning into "A Night of Free Association With Garry 
Shandling." But it came close. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of Thursday night's first show at the Irvine Improv, Shandling, 44, 
would start a story, get sidetracked, chat with the crowd and then head back to 
his original point. Not a classic stand-up performance, but, again, what can be 
reasonably expected of someone working from yellow legal pages on a stool? 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-Shandling crowd didn't seem to mind if he was skirting his potential. 
It was as if the performer had invited about 300 of his closest friends for a 
night of trial and error. He also had two shows scheduled Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brentwood resident, however, was not trying to polish or craft a stand-up 
show. He was merely there to work on new material for the Grammys, which he 
will host for the fourth time, on March 1 on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 But when fans are paying $20 a head, it's reasonable to expect something more 
than a tired-looking man thumbing through his notes.  
</P>
<P>
 The sold-out 60-minute set included a few of Shandling's old chestnuts but 
lacked his famous broken-leg trip to Hawaii and the time he met then-Vice 
President George Bush at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we heard how the music awards will be having a gun-for-Grammys swap. 
Referring to some of the nominees who are in trouble with the law, he said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be a very big night." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's show started off as typical Shandling, king of the fret, except 
this time it wasn't his hair he was fretting over. Apparently the applause died 
down too soon for the star of HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show." If he hadn't 
gotten to the stage as quickly as he did, he lamented, the room would've been 
silent by the time he walked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he turned to a new mural of him on the wall and asked: "Geeez. Do I look 
that troubled?" 
</P>
<P>
 From there, he launched into a routine that jumped from the Winter Olympics to 
the Bobbitts to the Grammys, in no particular order. Bantering with the crowd 
served as his segues. During all this, the Arizona-raised comedian found time 
to floss his teeth and pick up broken glass he had found on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, all the disjointed musings and tangential thinking caught up 
with Shandling. (He even kidded he was too tired to do the second show.) The 
ramblin' man's last 10 minutes fairly dribbled off the stage. He closed with a 
quick joke, thanked the audience and disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, Shandling's previous live stand-up show was also in Irvine, at 
the Barclay Theatre, when he recorded his splendid 1991 HBO special, "Garry 
Shandling: Stand-Up." It's a shame he couldn't find any of that same energy 
Thursday, especially when you consider that vintage Shandling is among the best 
in stand-up.

TALES FROM A ROCKY ROADIE; POP MUSIC: PHIL KAUFMAN, THE GRAM PARSONS CREMATOR 
AND CHARLES MANSON-ALBUM PRODUCER, SIGNS HIS RAUCOUS MEMOIRS IN ANAHEIM TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "It is sort of a unique story, stealing a body and burning it in the desert," 
allows Phil Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
 It's such little career highlights that permit Kaufman, a road manager, to 
have an autobiography out at a time when some of his former star clients don't 
even have active careers. Especially the ones he has torched. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, he only stole and cremated one body, and that was actually a noble, if 
thoroughly drunken, act of friendship toward his departed friend, country/rock 
pioneer Gram Parsons. But that's not the only event that makes "Road Mangler 
Deluxe" (written with Colin White, White/Boucke Publishing, $9.75) a 
rambunctious page-turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman also happened to produce the now-infamous "Lie" album by his onetime 
prison-mate Charles Manson. As one of the persons who defined the job of road 
manager , Kaufman has worked for Parsons, the Rolling Stones, Frank Zappa, Joe 
Cocker, Emmylou Harris and others, becoming an industry legend in the process.  
</P>
<P>
 He'll be sharing some of his road stories during a book-signing at Tower 
Records in Anaheim (220 N. Beach Blvd.) at 1 p.m. today and 11 a.m. Sunday at 
Bookstar in Torrance (2730 Pacific Coast Highway). 
</P>
<P>
 Recently at the Burbank "Tonight Show" studio, Kaufman was at work, though 
you'd scarcely know it by seeing the 58-year-old walrus-mustached, tattooed 
half-biker/half-cherub dancing down the halls, casting one-liners at the unwary 
celebrities and crew in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
 His longtime employer and friend Harris was appearing on the show, and he'd 
already done his work -- "a 100% need-to-know-basis responsibility" -- of 
making sure his client was at the gig and in working order.  
</P>
<P>
 That oftentimes is a major task. In the case of working for legendary imbiber 
Cocker, it meant: 
</P>
<P>
 "Take Joe to work on this shoulder, take Joe home on that shoulder," Kaufman 
recalls. "It was a very distasteful, menial job for me. But once I got Joe to 
work, it was almost worth it when he was onstage." 
</P>
<P>
 His job also entails having the foresight to deal with any contingency, so 
that when everyone was snowed-in once at the Denver airport, Harris and her 
band were among the very few to make it out, arriving at their gig in 
four-wheel drive vehicles he'd rented from a ski resort.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Zappa's band missed a connecting flight, Kaufman scoured up private Lear 
jets to get them to the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he gets the logistics out of the way, the other big part of his job 
pretty much is the dancing and joking part.  
</P>
<P>
 "I kinda like me. I feel better than James Brown," he said, and he seems so at 
home, and relaxedly outrageous, in any situation, that it makes the gigs go 
smoother. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I may be so bold, I've made an art form of this job, in getting along with 
people and taking care of business. I've had guys tell me, "Hey, thanks man, 
you're really nice; most road managers are real asses. Usually, the bigger the 
star, the bigger the attitude of the road manager.' The way I see it, my job is 
not to make it difficult; it's to make it easy for the artists and everybody, 
but keep control. If you can make your point with humor, you don't lose a 
friend doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are those Kaufman doesn't especially care if he's friends 
with. He's extremely protective of his artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody's rude to Emmylou, he's gonna really hear it from me. In London 
once, this guy came up to Emmylou backstage at the Wembley Arena, and he 
grabbed me and said 'I got an artist here; she's better than Emmylou; she can 
sing better. . . . Emmylou's gonna be eatin' her shorts.' I said 'Excuse me, 
could you come with me for a second?' I walked him to the door and decked him." 
</P>
<P>
 He took a similar approach on an airliner once. 
</P>
<P>
 "The band's crew was having a food fight, really rowdy. The stewardess came up 
said to me, 'Look, I am gonna have them arrested at the airport unless you do 
something.' So I went up to the biggest guy in the crew, said 'stand up,' and 
(expletive) hit him right in the mouth, sat him down and said, "Now you 
(expletive) sit there and don't get out of that seat until we get to the 
airport." Boy that made it quiet in the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, something like that could have reflected poorly on Emmy. I don't think 
I'm as paternalistic toward my artists as I am pal-istic. I'm their pal. I'm 
not exactly a fatherly image, but if I can help them with something, I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Harris: "I keep hiring Phil because he's the one who remembers all the 
funny anecdotes so I can tell them on the 'Tonight Show.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Their friendship stretches back over two decades to when she was a backup 
singer with Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman has his job wired pretty tight, considering that when Parsons first 
asked him to become a road manager, Kaufman's response was, "What's that?" 
</P>
<P>
 He learned it was simply a mobile version of what he'd already been doing for 
the Rolling Stones while they were in Los Angeles finishing up their "Beggar's 
Banquet" album. Kaufman, fresh out of prison and a self-proclaimed "jazz 
bigot," had never heard of the Stones when a friend lined him up for a job as 
their "executive nanny," as Mick Jagger came to call him.  
</P>
<P>
 When he came home from his first day on the job with a handful of cash and the 
keys to a Cadillac, his girlfriend of the time hit the roof, thinking he'd 
stolen them. "No, it's this thing called rock 'n' roll. They give you money and 
cars." He got to like the life -- and the music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He attributes the confidence he brings to his job to his prison experience, 
which resulted from a botched marijuana-smuggling attempt in the early '60s.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something I want to do again; I don't recommend it as a panacea for 
people with inferiority complexes, but prison gave me a real insight into life. 
It really woke me up. I came out a better person, not because of the penal 
system, but because I decided I wasn't going to let it be a negative 
experience. I actually had some good times in prison." 
</P>
<P>
 And, while there, he made contacts with influential people.  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, some of the finest murderers I know are in prison," he said. When he met 
Charles Manson at Terminal Island in the mid '60s, Manson was a skinny would-be 
musician who Kaufman said sang like Frankie Laine and hung around his "family." 
He wasn't impressed by Manson's rap, but he did like the family's free way with 
sex. Later, when the family was arrested, "I realized I'd had sex with every 
one of those murderesses," he recounts in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 He had already fallen out with Manson before the murders and indeed says he 
may have been one of the intended targets of the La Bianca murders. Until all 
the evidence against Manson came out in the trial, Kaufman hadn't thought the 
"take acid, make love" Mansonites could be capable of such crimes.  
</P>
<P>
 With that belief, and seeing money to be made, in 1971 he released the "Lie" 
album, made from sessions he had previously produced of Manson's music. Though 
quite a collector's item now (and with a song off it recently covered by Guns 
'N Roses), it didn't zoom up the hit parade then.  
</P>
<P>
 "Still, prior to the convictions, I went up to Telegraph Road in Berkeley, the 
most radical place in the world in the '60s, but not one shop would touch that 
record. Granted, it was a real piece of trash. But it's a great interest 
generator, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman claims Manson had signed the rights to the songs over to him, and he's 
having a lawyer look into collecting royalties on Axl Rose's version of "Look 
at Your Game Girl." He doesn't feel any guilt in trying to profit from the 
Manson connection, figuring it's due recompense for having his life threatened 
by family members. And that Rose-covered tune was the song Manson used to 
entice females into the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He meant 'Look at your game, girl,' like 'See the the head game you're 
playing, when you could be free and be with me.' I'd listen to him sing it to 
these new girls, and it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman's most noted participation in rock history came in 1973 when he and a 
friend used a borrowed hearse to steal his friend Parson's body from LAX and 
drive it out to Joshua Tree to cremate it. Parsons had been estranged from his 
wealthy Southern family, and he had a pact with Kaufman that if he died, the 
body would go to his beloved Joshua Tree, not the family plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman's recounting of that tale is moving, hilariously irreverent and too 
involved to detail here, making it a good thing it's all in his book. The 
outcome is that Parsons' charred molecules are now part of the desert scenery, 
and Kaufman was tried and compelled to reimburse a mortuary for the cost of the 
casket. 
</P>
<P>
 While burning corpses can give one a bit of a reputation, Kaufman says it 
hasn't given him a stigma to live down.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people in this business were fans of Gram's. So when they talk to 
me, it isn't 'I heard you stole somebody's body.' They know the story." 
</P>
<P>
 His greatest credibility comes, he says, from working for Harris.  
</P>
<P>
 "Emmylou gives me credibility. When somebody as respectable as Emmylou 
continually asks for me to work for her, it means I must be doing something 
right. I feel very honored to work for her." 
</P>
<P>
 He's not over-enamored of the changes that have taken place in the music 
business since he's been in it, even if its business-like manner makes his job 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, you'd have situations like, (he assumed a mellow hippie 
voice) 'My old lady will make the meals man, and we've got a van; we'll pick 
you up in and take you to your tents .' That's gone now. Years ago small 
entrepreneurs were the promoters. Now it's big promoters. They have gotten more 
callous, too, more corporate, more business. In older days they were fun 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've even changed the title of what I do. Now it's a tour manager. The 
difference between a road manager and a tour manager, the way I see it, is a 
tour manager has Hal Burton briefcases, pagers, at least one cellular phone, an 
incredibly (expletive) attitude, and they are more important than the artists. 
The road manager is the opposite: He takes care of business. I am definitely a 
road manager." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's been considering getting into the more lucrative field of artist 
management.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been entertaining that thought, that or take all the money from this 
book and go buy a Volkswagen camper and (go) off somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he met co-author White, and began dictating his stories into a 
cassette recorder. When the publication of "Road Mangler Deluxe" was feted at 
Brown's Diner in Nashville, Tenn., a few months back, more than 400 friends and 
celebrities showed up. After decades of working behind the scenes for others, 
Kaufman says he doesn't feel odd to have the spotlight on him now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been a celebrity, in my own mind. I'm just getting more coverage 
now."

WHO WILL REPLACE GLENN CLOSE IN 'SUNSET BOULEVARD'?; THEATER: PRODUCERS ARE 
SEARCHING FOR 'A STAR' TO BE L.A.'S SECOND NORMA DESMOND. CLOSE'S CONTRACT 
EXPIRES JUNE 26. SHE WILL OPEN ON BROADWAY IN NOVEMBER. 
</P>

<P>
 Now that it is official that Glenn Close, not Patti LuPone, will be Broadway's 
first Norma Desmond in "Sunset Boulevard," a new guessing game can begin: Who 
will be L.A.'s second Norma Desmond? 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous rumors and months of speculation, a spokesman for "Sunset" 
confirmed on Friday that Close will leave L.A.'s "Sunset Boulevard" when her 
contract expires on June 26. According to the current schedule, she won't open 
at the Minskoff Theater in New York until Nov. 17. A new Norma will have to be 
in place here long before Close opens there. 
</P>
<P>
 John Barlow, a New York-based spokesman for the L.A. production said Friday 
that no one has yet been picked to replace Close but added that we should know 
"shortly. They are now going through the Norma search." Barlow said they are 
looking for "a star." 
</P>
<P>
 The role is "the part of a lifetime. You'd eat somebody's laundry for a year 
to get that part," Meryl Streep recently told Entertainment Weekly. However, a 
spokeswoman for Streep said the actress herself is "not a possibility at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 An unconfirmed report by columnist Liz Smith on Wednesday that Close got the 
New York gig so upset LuPone that she missed three performances in the role in 
London on Wednesday and Thursday, said LuPone spokesman Robert Garlock. 
However, Garlock said she went on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Because LuPone's London contract stipulated that she also would play the role 
in New York, she is likely to receive a hefty sum as a buyout. Garlock said she 
would demand compensation "in the millions." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's disappointed she's not in the show, but she's also disappointed by the 
way she was treated," said Garlock, who added that the diva was informed of 
Close's casting only one hour prior to curtain time on Wednesday -- and it was 
her agent, who had read about it in the papers, who told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Garlock cited several other disagreements between LuPone and the show's 
producer-composer Andrew Lloyd Webber: She was not given approval over who 
would replace her co-star Kevin Anderson in London, as Garlock said she had 
been promised; she was not allowed to sing two songs from the show at the 
Westwood Playhouse in January, 1993, and only later was told that it was 
because Barbra Streisand was recording the same songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The stream of rumors that she might be replaced were upsetting, said Garlock. 
Some of these were fed by Lloyd Webber himself. For example, in a magazine 
article in The Times last month, Lloyd Webber was quoted saying that Close "is 
a joy and fun to work with. Which I must say is a change from, shall we say, 
another Norma we've had." In the same article, Lloyd Webber added that LuPone 
is "a superb performer. But what she must do is to understand not to be 
threatened. Patti just needs to relax a bit. That's all. And not worry." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Lloyd Webber could not be reached by press time. 
</P>
<P>
 Garlock said LuPone was approached by the producers of the new Stephen 
Sondheim/James Lapine musical, "Passion," but didn't consider the request 
because it would have required her to break her "Sunset" contract. A spokesman 
for "Passion" confirmed the show's casting agents had investigated LuPone's 
availability last fall, before a workshop production was held, but were told 
that she was unavailable. Donna Murphy has had the role since then.

 It's a Wrap: Veteran KNBC Entertainment Reporter David Sheehan is leaving the 
station and may wind up soon at his former station, rival KCBS-TV. In a 
statement released by KNBC, officials said that Sheehan "has informed us that 
he has had a great career at KNBC-TV and has accomplished the goals that he set 
for himself nine years ago when he joined the station. He has decided to pursue 
other career opportunities and looks forward to new challenges." Sheehan is the 
latest in a series of anchors and reporters to leave KNBC in recent months. 
KCBS-TV General Manager Bill Applegate said Friday that he had talked with 
Sheehan about joining the "Action News" team but that no formal negotiations 
had taken place. However, Applegate added, "If you were going to make a bet on 
David winding up here, it would be a good bet."

 * Indecency Reprieve?: A federal appeals court in Washington has agreed to 
take another look at government regulations banning indecent programming on 
broadcast and cable TV. The rules were thrown out in November after a 
three-judge panel held them to be unconstitutional. But now the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit says it will reconsider that 
decision. At issue are FCC regulations that had barred indecent TV and radio 
broadcasts between 6 a.m. and midnight and that had allowed cable-TV operators 
to ban what they deemed indecent programming from leased-access channels.

 Comic Sick: Bill Hicks, one of the more bracing figures on the comedy club 
circuit, is reported to be "very ill" with pancreatic cancer and resting at his 
parents' home in Little Rock, Ark. His condition was announced in a written 
statement issued Friday by his management company, which would not comment 
further on how long he has been ill or on prospects for his recovery. A 
longtime cult favorite in England for his dark and biting comic view, Hicks, 
32, has been building a sizable U.S. following in the last two years. In 
October, a comic routine he had taped for David Letterman's "Late Show" was 
completely excised after it was deemed too controversial. STAGE

 The Cold Shoulder: "Unfinished Stories," the Sybille Pearson play that Gordon 
Davidson staged at the Mark Taper Forum in 1992 has opened Off-Broadway to 
discouraging reviews. "It ultimately boils down to a small, whining play about 
some disagreeable people who can't get along," wrote David Richards in the New 
York Times. Jan Stuart of Newsday found it "curiously stillborn" and said 
Davidson's "shockingly reverential direction . . . weighs and sifts through 
every last word as if he were panning for gold." Clive Barnes of the Post found 
Davidson's work "sterling," but "the play rang false." "The title describes the 
work itself," wrote Howard Kissel of the Daily News.

 * Pacino Gets His Own Theater: It won't be called the Al Pacino Theater, but 
the actor is getting his own pocket-size theater on lower Broadway to try out 
new material, including plays and readings for proposed movies. "Al's always 
wanted his own theater . . . and now he's got it," said Michael Hadge, a New 
York stage director and Pacino's partner in his production company, Chal 
Productions. "This is for Al to try out material he's already interested in," 
Hadge said, noting that the location was being kept secret for the moment to

 Not 2 Live: Members of the controversial rap group 2 Live Crew were not as 
nasty as they wanted to be at a concert early Friday in Cincinnati. Lead singer 
Luther Campbell said police had threatened to arrest them and the audience if 
they performed their usual act. "We don't want you all to go to jail," he said. 
"We don't want anybody to get hit in the head." The group left after about 10 
minutes when some fans began climbing on stage. Four years ago, Cincinnati 
record stores stopped selling the group's album "Nasty as They Wanna Be" after 
the Hamilton County sheriff threatened obscenity charges. QUICK TAKES

 Choreographer Lar Lubovitch, whose Dance Company performs this weekend at the

"The Red Shoes." Lubovitch's work will have new life, however, as the American 
Ballet Theatre plans to perform "The Red Shoes" ballet as part of its spring 
season at Lincoln Center. . . . Comedian Paula Poundstone has been signed by E! 
Entertainment Television to co-host the cable network's pre- and post-Academy

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; GOING BY THE GOOD BOOK; MICHAEL W. SMITH, KING OF CHRISTIAN 
POP, GETS BACK TO SOME ATTRACTIVE BASICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his Father's house there are many mansions, and Michael W. Smith has made a 
good move by deciding to play in some of the smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading man in Christian pop, Smith has risen in the past few years to 
arena-headlining stature. He doesn't do those bigger mansions modestly, either. 
Smith's 1991 show at the Bren Events Center in Irvine came complete with 
dazzling lighting effects, while the music replicated the slick, commercial 
sound of his albums, full of chiming synthesizers, swooping electric guitars 
and the occasional machine-driven pop-R&B dance beat. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving even higher on the ladder last year, when he played at the Forum 
in Inglewood, Smith has decided to at least temporarily leave the trappings of 
arena grandeur in storage. A six-week trek dubbed "The Acoustic Tour" skips the 
arenas and brings him to college auditoriums and major churches -- including 
his visit Thursday night to the Vineyard Christian Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3,200 seats, the sold-out sanctuary was the perfect-size hall for a pop 
show: big enough to have the buzz of excitement that comes from being in a 
crowd, and small enough to allow a performer to make an intimate connection 
with everyone in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith spoke gospel when he paused midway through the two-hour show to comment 
on the difference between playing the big mansions and the little ones: In an 
elaborately staged arena concert, he said, "You've gotta go by the book or you 
mess the show up. Here, I can do what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 That involved taking many trips back to the early stages of his decade-long 
recording career, and stripping down his glitzy studio sound to far more 
attractive basics. There is something sweet about a real piano playing off a 
real Hammond B3 organ -- the combination that dominated many of the songs 
(actually, Smith's piano was digital rather than acoustic, but he only once 
programmed it to issue the tinkly-chime instant-schmaltz keyboard tone that 
sugars a lot of his recorded work). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The West Virginia-raised, Nashville-based singer mixed styles well. He and his 
five-man band offered glistening heartland rock a la Bruce Hornsby, the 
polished folk-pop that we're accustomed to hearing from the likes of Shawn 
Colvin and Mary-Chapin Carpenter, and even a harmonically elaborate number, 
"Providence," that recalled Genesis at its most radio-ready. One song flowed 
with a tense Latin current, and another borrowed a reggae rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 These well-crafted surroundings, adorned by a rich, four-part harmony support, 
were enough to compensate for some of the least-commanding singing you'll hear 
from a substantial pop star. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's greatest natural gift is his film-idol looks (he jokingly played to 
the sex symbol image a wee bit during the romantic ballad, "Cross My Heart," by 
tossing in a semi-seductive, Barry White-style aside. "I couldn't resist," he 
said, in wry acknowledgment of the moment's naughtiness). But if the face is 
that of Don Johnson, the voice is more Woody Allen -- scratchy, wispy, and 
pinched, with almost no body or heft. At least Smith's singing is tunefully 
elastic, and he provides himself with flavorful melodies as if they were his 
birthright. Given harmony support that could be Beach Boys lovely one moment 
("I Will Be Here For You") and chain-gang urgent the next ("Nothin' but the 
Blood of Jesus"), he got by with a lot of help from his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's songs are not daring: The aim is to comfort and reaffirm rather than 
to challenge and disturb. There's nothing prickly in his faith as there is with 
that wrathful rock Jeremiah, Bob Dylan (it's a pity that Christian popsters 
don't draw regularly from Dylan, who is this era's greatest and most prolific 
writer of songs-as-prayer and songs-as-prophecy). Nor do you get the mystical 
transports of ecstasy that sweep up Van Morrison in his utterly idiosyncratic 
Christian odes. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Smith avoids adventurous extremes, at least he doesn't deal in fluff. 
</P>
<P>
 Platitudes did crop up in songs like "Give It Away" and "Love One Another," 
but they were less the gist of the set than extra goodies for the fans -- 
rousing, feel-good workouts for listeners who were more than willing to sing 
along, and impressively able to stay in tune while doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith devoted the first third of his show to songs that posed conflicts and 
acknowledged a world of trouble -- including back-to-back ballads in which he 
tried to sort through the shock and pain of a close friend's death. That 
segment ended, in "Leesha," with the inevitable appeal to Christian belief as a 
triumph over death. Still, Smith's plaintive delivery underscored how hard it 
is to live with grief even when one has recourse to the comforts of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith used a long solo segment to reach out to the audience with chatter that 
blended humor and sincerity and showed a nice, personal touch -- something that 
was missing from his Bren Center show in '91. But the solo turn became part of 
an overlong sequence of ballads that had some restless youths in the house 
yelling for more rockin' stuff. Eventually, Smith and band obliged with tougher 
songs such as "Nothin' but the Blood of Jesus" and "Secret Ambition." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has followed the career pattern of his former employer and frequent 
songwriting partner, Amy Grant, in downplaying overtly religious imagery on 
recent albums that have brought him crossover success. But he finished the show 
with some well-received hymns and prayers, indicating he isn't about to forget 
that there is a cross in crossover.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; A BREAK IN THE MIGHTY CLOUDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anybody had the inside track on musical inspiration, you'd think it would 
be a gospel quartet. That goes double for one as noteworthy as the Mighty 
Clouds of Joy. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a performance Thursday that followed mighty clouds of rain across the 
Southland, the veteran quartet sang too often like modest patches of niceness.  
</P>
<P>
 A competent gospel group will elicit nods and murmurs of approval from the 
faithful, which the Grammy Award-winning foursome did several times through the 
90-minute show to a less than capacity audience at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
But a great group in peak form will turn even the biggest skeptics around -- or 
at least get them looking around seriously for the gate where the train to 
glory departs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clouds approached that level of fervor just twice, both in the show's 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was an extended workout on "Heavy Load," in which founding lead 
singer Joe Ligon did some extemporized preaching over a vamped verse. That's 
the Gospel 101 way to build intensity from a whisper to a scream, and Ligon 
seemed, unlike most of the night, to push himself to higher and higher vocal 
heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The other transcendent moment came, ironically, during a show-closing 
rendition of "Shout," the Isley Brothers' secularized R&B version of a old-time 
gospel roof-raiser. The Irvine Barclay's roof stayed securely in place, but at 
least the seats rattled a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 And when a woman took Ligon up on his invitation for audience members to join 
them on stage and do "the Holy Ghost shout," she brought a spontaneity and 
genuine spark to the show that had been largely missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Several elements conspired against the quartet musically breaking free of this 
mortal coil. While the Irvine Barclay is a lovely venue for many types of 
performance, the air-conditioned comfort of a sit-down theater works against 
listeners from taking a more active role in the show. There's nothing like a 
cheap plastic fold-up chair in a sweltering tent on a muggy Sunday morning to 
get folks up and testifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the Clouds' four-man backing band played as lifelessly as a Las 
Vegas show band in the third year of a five-year contract. Guitarist Little 
Joey Williams and keyboardist Alphonso McClain, in particular, looked for all 
the world as though they were toiling away stitching tongues into running 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 They provided little of the dynamic shading and lean-but-solid support that 
marks the best gospel backing bands. The lounge-bar-in-space piano sound 
McClain selected on his synthesizer didn't help.  
</P>
<P>
 The music also suffered from an unflattering sound mix in which the 
instrumentalists often overwhelmed the vocalists. If the striations from 
soprano to bass cannot be distinguished, a gospel quartet is damned.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if the Mighty Clouds don't still possess the raw materials for 
something better. Ligon's gruff roar provides the perfect counterpoint and 
dramatic tension against the silky high harmonies of the other Clouds: Richard 
Wallace, Wilbert Williams and Michael McCowin. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, flashes of brilliance shone through now and then, as with 
Williams' stratospheric solo, reminiscent of Phillip Bailey, in "Walk Around 
Heaven All Day." 
</P>
<P>
 What is so special about such gospel forbears as the Sensational Nightingales 
and contemporaries like the Five Blind Boys of Alabama or the Zion Harmonizers 
is how they can make every performance, even every song, a convincing 
expression of the divine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clouds, by comparison, were all too earthbound. For one who's made a 
career out of focusing his audience's attention on the kingdom of heaven, Ligon 
spent an inordinate amount of time addressing such earthly concerns as their 
souvenir CDs, tapes and photos on sale in the lobby and extending warnings 
against unauthorized videotaping of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Making this substandard performance even more disappointing are how rare it is 
that an ensemble of the stature of the Mighty Clouds visits Orange County and 
what a good year it's been for male traditional gospel groups: The Blind Boys 
and the Fairfield Four both released albums for major labels in 1993, and the 
Mighty Clouds spent a high-profile month last fall appearing with Paul Simon at 
New York's Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, nobody said gospel groups are perfect. After the inevitable off 
night, perhaps they just need to be forgiven.

COMEDY REVIEW; A RAMBLING SHANDLING TESTS GRAMMY JOKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a three-year absence from performing stand-up in front of a live 
audience, it's understandable that Garry Shandling's rhythm would be a little 
off. But how does he explain his inability to finish a sentence or hold a 
thought, much less weave together a story, which is the comic's general style?  
</P>
<P>
 Running roughshod as he did over stand-up comedy's basic tenets (the same way 
he does on TV), Shandling's personality, disarming smile, material and banter 
kept the show from turning into "A Night of Free Association With Garry 
Shandling." But he came close. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of Thursday night's show (the first of four at the Irvine Improv), 
Shandling, 44, would start a story, get sidetracked, chat with the crowd and 
then head back to his original point. Not a classic stand-up performance but, 
again, what can be reasonably expected of someone working from yellow legal 
pages on a stool? 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-Shandling crowd didn't seem to mind if he was skirting his potential. 
It was as if the performer had invited about 300 of his closest friends for a 
night of trial and error. 
</P>
<P>
 Shandling, however, was not trying to polish or craft a stand-up show. He was 
merely there to work on new material for the Grammys, which he will host for 
the fourth time, on March 1 on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 But when fans are paying $20 a head, it's reasonable to expect something more 
than a tired-looking man thumbing through his notes. The 60-minute set included 
a few of Shandling's old chestnuts, but lacked his famous broken-leg trip to 
Hawaii and the time he met then Vice President George Bush at the White House.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we heard how the music awards will be having a gun-for-Grammys swap. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to some of the nominees who are in trouble with the law, he said: "I 
think it's going to be a very big night." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's show started off as typical Shandling, king of the fret, except 
this time it wasn't his hair he was fretting over. Apparently the applause died 
down too soon for the star of HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show." If he hadn't 
gotten to the stage as quickly as he did, he lamented, the room would've been 
silent by the time he walked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he turned to a new mural of him on the wall and asked: "Geez. Do I look 
that troubled?" 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, all the disjointed musings and tangential thinking caught up 
with Shandling. The ramblin' man's last 10 minutes fairly dribbled off the 
stage. He closed with a quick joke, thanked the audience and disappeared.

WRITING FOR CREDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Grazer's stunningly arrogant comment regarding "roundtable" 
screenwriting -- "If a script is good, what does it matter how many people 
wrote it?" -- is typical of the contempt in which Hollywood studio types hold 
writers, brought about by the long and continuing ineffectiveness of the 
Writers Guild of America West ("Roundtable Writing: A Headache for Guild," Feb. 
9). 
</P>
<P>
 Right, Brian.What does it matter who wrote "The Three Sisters"? Or "The Glass 
Menagerie"? Or "All About Eve"? 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to humbly suggest that you "roundtable" the producers and 
directors of your next movie. And I further suggest, since it doesn't matter 
who gets credit for what in films, that you restrict your credit to one among a 
dozen or so others (who probably had more to do with the actual making of the 
movie than you) in a credit roll at the end of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 See how much you like that roundtable.

 Re: "A Lift From Lillith" (Morning Report, Feb. 7): Mine was one of the 20 
million homes that tuned in to "Frasier" for Lillith's return.I loved the first 
part of the show, when she stayed in character. But I hated it when she began 
to cry and beg and whine, which was totally out of character. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, writers, give us the old Lillith; and, producers, please bring her back 
permanently, not necessarily married to Frasier but in a regular role, 
intimidating everybody in sight!

IT'S CASTING DIRECTOR  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times continues to call casting directors casting agents ("South Carolina 
High School Teacher Wins Miss USA Contest," Section A, Feb. 12). There is no 
such thing as a casting agent.Casting directors do not represent actors, and we 
do not receive commissions (as do talent agents). Casting directors are hired 
by producers and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 And one more issue: In the review, " 'Twogether': Uncommonly Reflective Love 
Story" (Calendar, Feb. 11), which I cast, the film is given a wonderful review 
and the casting is mentioned, yet in the crew list costume design and sound 
editing are mentioned but no casting credit is given. Why does The Times 
continue to neglect credit for casting directors?

THEATER REVIEW; CLASSIC 'ANNE' COMES TO LIFE AT WILSHIRE THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Great American Children's Theatre of Wisconsin is in town again for a 
10-day stop at its home away from home, the Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills, 
with a capable and often captivating production about a spunky, red-headed 
orphan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Annie"? Nope, it's the 1908 L.M. Montgomery classic "Anne of Green Gables." 
</P>
<P>
 Staged in period costume, on a large, raked set of muted greens and browns 
resembling a page from a pop-up storybook, this favorite tale about the 
spirited orphan of Prince Edward Island who changes the lives of everyone she 
meets is not for girls only. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent performance, boys were chuckling, too, at Anne Shirley's comic 
misadventures on her bumpy road to young adulthood -- dying her hated red hair 
green, intoxicating her best friend by mistake, breaking her slate over the 
head of a young tormentor, coming to grief over her temper. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while Joanna Blythe's adaptation accents the fun, it offers some 
substance as well, allowing the audience to feel Anne's growing pains and the 
close bond that develops between her and her at first reluctant, adoptive 
guardians -- Marilla (Ellen Lochhead and Matthew (Paul Bentzen). 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Leslie Reidel, the cast (all adults) does a respectable job in 
dual roles -- Candace Taylor and Patrick Lawlor, in particular, are appealing 
as Anne's best friend Diana and as her would-be beau Gilbert, respectively, 
while Carol Zippel is properly snooty as disapproving Rachel Lynde. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Julie Jones' thoroughly enjoyable performance in the title role, 
however, that makes this "Anne" more than just a pleasant introduction to a 
classic. With effervescent charm, Jones captures the essence of the young girl 
whose irrepressible enthusiasm for life and discovery both bemuses and enchants 
those around her. 
</P>
<P>
 Composer Adam Guettel accompanies the action with a light touch; Linda Black 
designed the attractive period costumes and Gary Baehler's lighting is clean 
and effective. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Anne of Green Gables," Wilshire Theatre, 8440 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly 
Hills, todayand next Saturday, 1 and 3 p.m.; Tue.-Fri., 10 a.m. and noon; Sun.,

 Dedicated to early music repertoire since its founding in 1978, the Tallis 
Scholars are no newcomers to the recently popularized realm of centuries-old 
music. Their central role in the movement -- not to mention their commanding 
musical presence -- lured a full house to Ambassador Auditorium on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program devoted almost entirely to vocal music of the 16th Century, the 
Tallis Scholars performance impressed mightily with engaging musicality, an ear 
for authenticity and scholarly interest. Led with a decisive hand by founding 
director Peter Phillips, the dozen-voice Tallis Scholars persuasively conveyed 
the unique and mesmerizing beauty of Renaissance polyphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Purity of tone and a seamless blend are hallmarks of the group, which gives 
proper weight and articulation to the hypnotic weave of the material. 
</P>
<P>
 Programmatically, the concert's first half was of a piece, between Nicolas 
Gombert's "Ego sum qui sum" and Phillippe Rogier's more extended and elaborate 
mass based on the Gombert piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Renaissance titan Orlando de Lassus' "Prophetiae Sibyllarum" opened the second 
half with its beguiling harmonic restlessness, in contrast to the timeless 
languor of the composer's "Lamentations III (for Maundy Thursday)," which was 
also performed. Closing on a note of enigmatic simplicity, Allegri's "Miserere" 
requires a split group, with singers answering the stage-center group with 
unearthly tones from the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 It all added up to a profound and transporting evening of music, courtesy of 
church musicians of 400 years hence, passionately purveyed by this ensemble. 
Testament to the appeal of early music, the music was of heaven and earth, then 
and now.

THEATER REVIEW; 'ABIGAIL'S' OFFERS A GLIMPSE OF LEIGH'S EARLY EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Mike Leigh's controversial film "Naked," about an angry young man on a 
self-destructive odyssey in London, isn't typical of the British artist's body 
of work. Leigh is usually more bittersweet while ironically depicting 
working-class relationships, as in the cult movie "Life Is Sweet" and his early 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fountainhead Theatre Company has mounted an ambitious, timely example of a 
Leigh stage experiment, "Abigail's Party." Although the production ultimately 
is unsatisfying, the 1977 comedy offers valuable perspective on the provocative 
filmmaker's technique. It is not generally known in the United States that 
Leigh's quasi-documentary, collaborative style emerged from his formative years 
in British theater. As Leigh prominently notes in the published script: " 
'Abigail's Party' was evolved from scratch entirely by rehearsal through 
improvisation." A similar approach created "Naked." 
</P>
<P>
 However, this improvisational style poses a major challenge for director Dane 
Holweger. How do you interpret such idiosyncratic material? Is it character? Or 
is it caricature? 
</P>
<P>
 On the page, "Abigail's Party" reads almost like absurdist satire by Edward 
Albee. In a suburban London living room, cocktails are consumed while mundane 
cliches are tediously recited. 
</P>
<P>
 We can either laugh at such characters, or we can feel sorrow and pity. 
Holweger tries to make "Abigail's Party" a party. Leigh, it would seem, would 
be more likely to maintain a respectful, objective eye. Holweger looks down on 
the two major characters without respect, trivializing them, so that when 
something serious does happen, we don't know what to make of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh's style of improvisation is but a distant cousin to Los Angeles comedy 
club sketches. It's rooted in genuine pathos, hard-earned experience and 
blue-collar desperation. It's naked. By contrast, the Fountainhead's version 
seems fashionably dressed in stand-up shtick. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Abigail's Party," Fountainhead Theatre, 1110 N. Hudson Ave., Hollywood.

ART REVIEW; TAKING A JOURNEY INTO 'DESERT DREAMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite endemic denial, the Southland does have a real history. It's not 
always a pretty picture, but one of its happier images involved artist Maynard 
Dixon. His rarely seen paintings and graphics are on view at the Palm Springs 
Desert Museum. The traveling exhibition's title, "Desert Dreams -- The Art of 
Maynard Dixon," comes from a new biography of the artist by UC Davis scholar 
Donald J. Hagerty, who organized the 70-work show for the Museum of Fine Arts, 
Museum of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist was born in Fresno and lived an itinerant life in the Southwest 
until he died at 71 in 1946. Essentially a rail-thin, elegant self-taught 
loner, he was encouraged by cowboy artist Frederick Remington and gained an 
early reputation in the Bay Area as a popular illustrator of stories by 
everybody from Jack London to O. Henry and Clarence Mulford -- of Hopalong 
Cassidy fame. Evidently Dixon's early work had some of the fictional, 
nostalgic, kiss-the-horse flavor of Hopalong's adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one account it was Dixon's L.A.-aesthetic connection that helped 
him decide to get serious. He met Charles Fletcher Lummis, one of Lotus Land's 
original, self-invented, flamboyant entrepreneurs. Lummis championed 
preservation of both the Southland's Latino and Native American legacies. He 
founded the Southwest Museum. His own house, El Alisal, for which Dixon did the 
decorative metal work, remains a local landmark. The house's sculpture was 
executed by John Gutzon Borglum, an artist cradled in Pasadena's 
crafts-oriented Arroyo movement. Borglum, of course, went on to carve the 
World's Largest Sculpture, that lovable mountain of kitsch, Mt. Rushmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Lummis introduced Dixon to the desert and the artist was hooked. He spent the 
rest of his days painting the Southwestern landscape and its original 
inhabitants, whom he revered as living in older and wiser ways. Native American 
philosophy may have inspired Dixon's own motto, "So live that you can look 
every damn man in the eye and tell him to go to hell." 
</P>
<P>
 So far everything about Dixon's life marks him as the period piece that 
current fashion would clearly hold him to be if it thought about him at all. 
But there is another clue. Besides Lummis, Dixon's other major support and 
inspiration was his second wife, Dorothea Lange. This great WPA photographer of 
the Dust Bowl is a decidedly modernist figure. So what was she doing married to 
a Brontosaurus? The likely conclusion is born out by the evidence of the work. 
Dixon was no dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a representational artist, he regularly spoke out in defense of 
abstract art that clearly molded the clean, dynamic composition of his own 
work. Going through the show, one picks up whiffs of everything from Art 
Nouveau to Cubism, from Regionalism to Metaphysical Surrealism. Dixon 
spontaneously employed the aesthetic recipe that has produced the best art in 
this part of the world from John McLaughlin to Ed Kienholz and Richard 
Diebenkorn. He was a synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are things about this art that put off contemporary viewers, that may 
tell us more about the eyes than the art. The dryness of Dixon's surfaces can 
be a real distraction. Nobody wants a world where even the clouds are made of 
adobe. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of Dixon's habit of seeing the desert landscape as sublime, its 
cowboys and Native Americans as stalwart and heroic? If that makes him appear 
sentimental today, it speaks worse of our cynicism than his idealism. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fun to go through the show imagining which of Dixon's fellow artists 
might like particular pieces, finding a bit of themselves in it. Marsden 
Hartley certainly would have responded to the crackling, symbolic sky of "Mesas 
in Shadow." The way "Moonlight Over Zion" hovers on the border of magic and 
abstraction would have gotten the attention of Georgia O'Keeffe. A quality of 
gently humorous poetry in the purple clouds descending over an adobe in "Late 
Afternoon" somehow sends a message to Ed Ruscha, and there is a smart, 
sonorously decorative screen that would take the attention of Billy Al 
Bengston. 
</P>
<P>
 The most heroic of Dixon's paintings is "Earth Knower." The Native American 
depicted is swathed in a dark blanket. Features and folds take on the 
topography of the surrounding hills. The hills have the color and weave of 
tribal patterns, of blankets and baskets that were the unself-conscious 
masterpieces of this land's original inhabitants. Like them, Dixon harmonized 
the human and the earthiness into a single entity.

TV REVIEW; SUSPENSEFUL, HISTORICAL 'RACE TO FREEDOM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Race to Freedom: The Underground Railroad" is terrific TV for young viewers 
unfamiliar with the United States' pre-Civil War racial history. 
</P>
<P>
 And for older audiences familiar with the saga of blacks escaping to Canada 
and outwitting the clutches of the repugnant 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, this 
production is as suspenseful, if not as lavish, as historical drama on TV 
usually gets.(It airs at 8 tonight on two cable outlets -- the Family Channel 
and BET.) 
</P>
<P>
 Following in the tradition of "Roots" and "The Autobiography of Miss Jane 
Pitman," "Race to Freedom" is the story of four slaves fleeing a North Carolina 
plantation for Canada, the "promised land," where bounty hunters can't legally 
touch them. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling by night on the so-called underground railroad -- in essence a 
network of friendly, above-ground shelters identified by candles burning in the 
windows -- the runaway slaves beat a desperate path to the Ohio River, where 
they encounter the underground railroad's real conductor, Harriet Tubman, who 
puts them on a genuine train for the Canadian border, where more trauma awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot in Ontario and co-starring Janet Bailey as a young plantation housekeeper 
reluctant to face the perils of freedom and Courtney Vance as her gritty 
fiancee, the movie is tightly directed by Don McBrearty from a compelling 
teleplay by Diana Braithwaite, Nancy Botkin and Peter Mohan.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the creators take some romantic license but hardly enough to tarnish the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey shines in her growth from docility to heroism, and the movie features 
flinty supporting performances (among them Dawnn Lewis' powerfully etched 
runaway, Glynn Turman's chilly bounty hunter and executive producer Tim Reid's 
Frederick Douglass. 
</P>
<P>
 The show resourcefully captures the 1850s with minimal production sophistry, 
and it's enriched by Melba Moore's soaring off-screen vocal motif of "Oh, 
Freedom."

JAZZ NOTES: ALL WILSON WANTS TO DO IS KEEP COMPOSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask Gerald Wilson and he will tell you that his musical loves have always been 
composing and arranging. In his 55-year career, he's written material that's 
been recorded by Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Ray Charles, 
Ella Fitzgerald and hundreds of others. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, who fronts his Orchestra of the '90s tonight at the Jazz Bakery in 
Culver City, being a bandleader or trumpeter has come second to the writing and 
arranging. In 1946, Wilson's big band was close to its peak. He was playing 
venues all across the country, including the Apollo Theatre in New York, where 
he was on the bill with Ellington and Jimmie Lunceford. But then he quit and 
disbanded his orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Apollo wanted me to play there twice a year for five years, bookings were 
coming in from all over. We were on top, but it was happening too fast," 
recalls the spry Wilson, 73, as he sits in his office at UCLA, where he teaches 
a survey class on the history of jazz. He said he thought: " 'This is fine, but 
this isn't what I'm looking for.' I hadn't even begun to get to where I wanted 
to get with writing." 
</P>
<P>
 So Wilson, who by the mid-'40s had written for Lunceford and others, decided 
to return to Los Angeles and study and write. "I studied very hard," he says. 
"I wanted to be able to handle strings, woodwinds, everything!" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson says that eventually he achieved his goal. "I can make my band sound 
any way I want to," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shelby, Miss., native's compositions have long had a modern bent, and are 
typified by complex interweavings of brass and reed passages that create a 
grand, pulsating sound. Pieces like "The Wailer" and "The Moment of Truth" show 
his ability to give the blues a regal stance, and his fondness for musical 
depictions of matadors and bullfighting can be heard in such long-lasting works 
as "Viva Tirado" and "Carlos." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson says that for several years, his ultimate goal was to write for the 
symphony. That wish was fulfilled in 1972, with his work "Debut: 5/21/72," 
commissioned by then-musical director Zubin Mehta for the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, which had its premiere at the Los Angeles Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he says his goal is to keep cranking out the material. "I want to continue 
writing now that I kind of feel that I can handle my stuff the way I like," he 
says. "And since jazz is a creative art form, I'll try to be creating 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson says he's never far from the process of composing and arranging. "I'm 
at the piano every day, getting things in my head that I can work on," he says. 
"I'm always seeking things to do orchestrally." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, whose most recent album, "Jenna," was recorded on the Discovery label 
in 1991, is currently trying to negotiate a new recording contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters 
Fellowship in 1990 now spends a good deal of his time teaching. He first began 
teaching jazz history classes at Cal State Northridge in 1970 and says he still 
relishes the contact with students that he now has at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're interested," he says, "and it's a chance for me to express my love 
for jazz. I love telling the students about these guys who are so great, who 
helped develop this music. It's beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz Meets Dance: Dancer-choreographer Pat Taylor had always wanted to do a 
piece with jazz musicians. "I liked the idea of jazz music kicking off the 
dance," she says. Two years ago, she found a willing collaborator in bassist 
Mark Shelby, leader of the group Black/Note. Their work, "Midtown Sunset," a 
series of nine pieces based on a collage by noted African American artist 
Romare Bearden, will will be performed Sunday afternoon at 3 at the 
Morgan-Wixson Theatre, 2627 Pico Blvd., in Santa Monica. Tickets are $10. 
Tonight's performance will benefit the Taylor's Dance Collective, which is the 
host of a summer camp for urban teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Midtown Sunset" will feature six dancers from Taylor's Jazzantiqua Dance 
Ensemble performing to music played by Shelby's quartet, which includes Phil 
Vieux (saxes), Ark Sano (piano) and Guy Killim (drums). 
</P>
<P>
 Shelby says his original music comprises a number of moods -- from swing to 
Afro-Cuban to waltzes -- but there's one overall stance: "It's romantic," he 
says. "There aren't a lot of complicated rhythms." 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (310) 828-7519, (310) 657-7115. 
</P>
<P>
 Critic's Choice: In the '60s, pianist McCoy Tyner's playing was often built on 
serpentine long lines that spoke as much of his be-bop roots as of his modern 
openness, exemplified by his work with John Coltrane. These days, the jazz 
giant, who appears with his trio Tuesday through Feb. 27 at Catalina Bar & 
Grill, favors a denser, though still lyrical, style often based on thick 
streams of notes. His trademark buoyancy, however, has never left.

ART REVIEW; DELAP: AT WORK IN 'HOUSE OF THE MAGICIAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Delap's art took wing in the '60s among that flock that distilled the 
youth cults of hot-rod and surfboard into the Southland Slick School. The whole 
enterprise played to the accompaniment of waves of pop music. The pertinent 
ditty for Delap was certainly the Lovin' Spoonful's "Do You Believe in Magic?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now, three decades later, all that is a history to be sorted and mulled. At 
present Cal State Fullerton's gallery director Mike McGee offers contemplation 
of Delap's work in an installation blending re-created works and graphics that 
span the decades, making something of a vest-pocket retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a handsome catalogue designed by Jerry Samuelson that contains 
ponderable essays by Peter Clothier and David Pagel. The whole flies under the 
title "The House of the Magician," bringing us back to the old song. The magic 
it wanted accepted was that old black type called love or, more properly, sex. 
In radical contrast to the puritanical present, sex was immensely fashionable 
in the '60s. It is a great metaphor for Delap's art, which is all about the 
fact that we continue to believe in certain illusions even after we know how 
they work. 
</P>
<P>
 The most uncharacteristic but visually delightful piece on view is "Floating 
Lady." The role is played in rotation by a series of female student volunteers. 
At first glance the piece seems to present an approximation of the old stage 
magician's levitation trick. The woman hovers in the air, suspended above a 
folding chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Mind you, it's perfectly obvious she is resting on a horizontal support, a 
kind of shelf contraption. Yet one wonders how the shelf is held firm by the 
flimsy chair and how it supports the weight of the young woman. But the 
ultimate fascination takes place in the viewer's mind. Rather than denounce the 
piece to ourselves as a cheap trick, we prefer to maintain it as a wonderful 
thing. We insist on believing in it with the same fervor that we cling to 
romance after we know it's a biological joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Floating Lady" inexplicably but firmly brings the Cool School's old master 
guru to mind -- Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp made us see all manner of objects as 
artworks by waving the magic wand of the artist's wit, will and irony. He 
planted the notion that art is a patent illusion that works because artist and 
viewer alike wish to suspend disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Literal suspension dominates much of Delap's work. "Large Blue Beam" greets 
viewers at the door. It hovers nose-high, seeming to emerge at an angle from 
the far wall passing through a glass pane. "Floating Lady III" is a wood beam 
across the gallery space. Ordinary enough, except a gap in the middle seems to 
make it defy gravity. Oh. A piece of Plexiglas spans the gap. That explains it. 
But not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houdin's House" is named for a French magician who inspired Harry Houdini. 
It's a three-sided metal enclosure with two panes of glass angled from the 
center to the open corners. The glass reflects surroundings but the mirrored 
images seem to be on the metal walls where they don't belong. Delap's deadpan 
delivery makes the illusion delightful. Earnest historians will note that the 
work makes a bridge between the Finish Fetish a la Billy Al Bengston and Larry 
Bell's version of Light and Space art. 
</P>
<P>
 Delap's graphic series have more relaxed fun than his minimalist sculpture. He 
shows a Parisian Ferris wheel with only one spoke, an ace disappearing into a 
prestidigitator's palm, and a stick that levitates from a thumb. It doesn't 
minimize the wizardry at all that these effects are simple cut-and-paste 
graphic design devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Delap's greatest achievement may be in providing an open sesame to the 
Southland aesthetic. To this day his colleagues from Ken Price to Ed Moses and 
Bob Graham strive to "make it magic."

 Thinking about planting a "For Sale" sign in front of your house? Better tour 
some model homes first. Then reach for the paint roller, wallpaper remover and 
the phone numbers of your favorite home improvement professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's recession-battered resale market is so competitive, real 
estate agents say, that successful sellers these days are the ones who make 
their properties look like model homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many others for buyers to choose from. Sellers are competing 
with one another and with new-home builders," said Tom Nash of Re/Max of 
Irvine, who specializes in residential sales. Agents who once simply advised 
sellers to clean out their closets and put on soft music to sway buyers now 
offer computerized lists of suggested improvements. Some refer their clients to 
interior designers to get a fresh perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 At the minimum, today's sellers find themselves cleaning, rearranging 
furniture, uncluttering and depersonalizing their homes before they are listed. 
Others install new carpeting, remove wallpaper, repaint walls, redo kitchen 
countertops and send appliances out for refinishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some determined sellers replace old aluminum sliding doors with French doors, 
install new chandeliers or add electric fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who want to sell are competing with the architecture of the '90s -- 
clerestory windows, plant ledges, dramatic high ceilings and lots of light, 
open spaces, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very specific, even adamant about things that need to be changed. When 
you take a car that's been off-road to a dealership, they don't put it on the 
lot that way. Each home should have a good going over, a detailing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers must decide how much time and money they can or will spend polishing 
up the place, weighing factors such as cash available, need for repairs, 
condition of competing properties and importance of a timely sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the basics that designers and real estate agents recommend -- such as 
painting and removing clutter -- are not costly, though. 
</P>
<P>
 To help give their lived-in abodes the look of a model home, some sellers are 
hiring interior designers who specialize in redecorating for resale. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior designer Joan Linder of Newport Beach is among those who will analyze 
a house and present the owner with a checklist of recommendations to make it 
more attractive to buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Nutting, also an interior designer, specializes in resale work as well. 
For years, he has worked on high-end properties on the Newport Beach market, 
but lately owners of properties in the medium price range are also seeking 
help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers typically charge $50 to $100 per hour, but some offer their services 
to home sellers for a set fee that may be lower. 
</P>
<P>
 What they offer, they say, is a fresh look at your house -- a place you may be 
too comfortable with to see through the eyes of a potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Mission Viejo home that had been on the market for six months, Linder 
spent five hours rearranging the furniture. She added a few new accessories, 
but the key change was eliminating unneeded furniture, creating conversational 
groupings and incorporating the stereo equipment that had lined the walls into 
existing bookcases. When the owner returned, she couldn't believe it was the 
same house, Linder said. It sold within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just balance and proportion can do so much. Sometimes all you have to do is 
rearrange the pictures and lamps and create an intimate setting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She often does more than that, though. For one client, Linder began on the 
outside to make an older house look larger and more modern. She had the brown 
trim, brick columns and side fences painted white to blend with the ivory 
stucco. Inside she added a focal point for the living room, an electric 
fireplace with black marble hearth and mantel. Some furniture was rented to 
complete the look; carpets were cleaned, and a soft drapery top was added to 
vertical blinds in the living room. The house sold in four weeks, she said. In 
this case, money spent on improvements boosted the house into a higher sales 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 But in most cases, improvements made to market the house are just going to put 
it one step ahead of the competition, Nutting said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are going to spend money, Nutting says it should be spent on the 
background. His advice: Invest in an inexpensive carpet that looks clean and 
new, bright, white paint, strategically placed blooming plants at the entrance 
and perhaps one piece of furniture in the right spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Many real estate agents are quick to point out that sellers today often have 
financial problems and can't afford to spend money on pre-sale improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents are seeing a lot of deferred maintenance now that they haven't seen in 
the past, said Mission Viejo-based Nancy Gromme of Century 21 Freedom Realty 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sales and buyer interest are up, prices are soft, and in many cases 
the sales price barely covers the sellers' loan, said Cherie Hartman, branch 
manager of Coldwell Banker's Dana Point-San Clemente office. 
</P>
<P>
 In those cases, the sales agents agree that the best thing to do is spend 
whatever you can to make the outside look attractive, clean the inside and 
remove clutter, personal items and large pieces of furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Herrera of Casa Blanca Realtors in Orange tells his clients not to 
spend too much on major remodeling because they are not going to recoup that 
money in the form of a higher sales price. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers, particularly in the older areas of the county where Herrera 
concentrates his efforts, are making very low offers, he said. He says money is 
better spent on a professional home inspection so sellers will know what they 
need to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buyers nowadays bring in their own inspectors to find leaks under the sink, 
loose toilets and improper wiring in the garage. The sellers may not want to 
fix everything, but at least they'll be aware of it" and be one step ahead of 
the potential buyer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After making decisions about repairs, you can concentrate on making your house 
look its best with these tips from designers and real estate agents: 
</P>
<P>
 * Open up spaces and make rooms look bigger by putting excess furniture in 
storage. Nutting says houses actually sell better when they are empty. "People 
are looking at your furniture and family pictures instead of the house," he 
said. Others, however, say it's better to have some furniture, even if you just 
create a fireplace grouping with a wing chair, table and lamp. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let in more light and update the room by taking down heavy window coverings. 
If there's a view, simply leave the windows bare so buyers can see it. If not, 
add window coverings that are light and inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider having appliances from another era refinished. Linder said it costs 
about $125 to refinish a refrigerator, an update she says is often worth the 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create focal points in rooms. Some homes have no focal points, and others 
have too many, Linder said. Simply putting a bright floral arrangement on a 
table can create a focal point. A strategically placed folding screen can 
eliminate focal points in a room with too many windows and doors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take the emphasis off problem spots by directing the viewer's eye elsewhere. 
If a floor is not in good shape, put down an area rug to create a focal point. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buy a new blanket in a compatible color and lay it corner to corner over a 
shabby bedspread, suggests Laguna Niguel interior designer Betty D. Hyde, who 
has done a lot of resale design work. You get a new look for a small price, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clean chrome bathroom fixtures with lemon oil to make them sparkle or buy 
new fixtures, Hyde recommends. She suggests buying a few new towels in fresh, 
bright colors and using scented bath oil often to make the whole house smell 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many designers advise painting dark woods white for a more contemporary 
look. Dark carpeting also has to go, according to Nash. And while you've got 
the paint out, Nutting advises, remember to paint the insides of cabinets as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make a small bedroom look larger by unifying elements. In one house, Linder 
used a decorative screen to cover a window and repeated the screen on a nearby 
wall. Large-scale pictures also make a room look bigger, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * When it's time to show the house, make sure the dishes are put away, the 
toilet seats are down and soft music is playing.

 As familiarity with the cooking styles of Asian countries increases in 
Southern California, so is local interest in growing Oriental vegetables. While 
some of the specialty vegetables are carried at Asian markets and some 
supermarkets, many are still hard to find fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that many are easy to grow and do well in our mild climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are able to grow almost anything here that can be grown in China, Korea, 
Japan and other Asian countries," says certified nurseryman Steve Kawaratani, 
who is landscape manager of Laguna Nursery in Laguna Beach. "We have the added 
bonus of having a 10-month growing season here, compared to two to three months 
in many other areas, which means a higher yield," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although vegetables such as Chinese bitter melon, bok choy and daikon (a type 
of radish) are not common in many Orange County gardens, they are a staple in 
Asian gardens and kitchens. "Southern California gardeners have traditionally 
produced the standard beans, peppers, tomatoes and eggplants," says seed 
specialist Andrew Goldsmith of San Clemente. He oversees the Southern 
California region for Vaughan's Seed Co., which sells vegetable seeds to 
greenhouses, nurseries and farmers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Growing Oriental vegetables gives people a chance to try a variety of 
vegetables with new flavors, colors and textures," says Goldsmith, who 
regularly visits Japan to work with seed companies there to determine what 
Oriental vegetable types grow best in California. "Having these vegetables on 
hand also enables you to prepare authentic ethnic dishes," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you can find Oriental vegetables in the market, they're always much 
fresher and better tasting from your own back yard," Kawaratani says. "You can 
also garden organically."  
</P>
<P>
 While the list of Oriental vegetables is long, there are several popular types 
that do well in Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 If it's peppers you yearn for, Goldsmith suggests growing the shishito pepper, 
a mild light green Japanese pepper about two to three inches long that is often 
used in stir-fries. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also tomatoes to choose from, such as the Japanese tomato odoriko. 
This small pink vegetable has a slightly pointed end and exceptional flavor, 
Goldsmith says.  
</P>
<P>
 In cucumbers you may want to try the Tasty Green, which is a dark green 
burpless Japanese slicer that grows up to 10 inches.  
</P>
<P>
 Market Express is a small white Japanese turnip one to two inches long with 
dark green leaves. This is heat-tolerant and does very well in Southern 
California.  
</P>
<P>
 Also popular is the kabocha, which means winter squash or pumpkin in Japanese. 
These squash are known for their dark golden-orange skin, says Goldsmith, 
noting that this vegetable is often grown here and sent to Japan. He suggests 
the Honey Delite, a large squash with good taste. 
</P>
<P>
 A vegetable that many non-Asians have heard about but aren't familiar with 
growing is bok choy. This white Chinese cabbage is tender, sweet and very mild. 
In Asian cooking, bok choy is often prepared alone or mixed with meats and in 
soups. Because this vegetable tends to be large, gardeners with limited space 
may want to try a dwarf variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all Oriental vegetables, the snow pea is perhaps the most widely known and 
grown. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach gardener Herb Lee regularly grows a large crop of snow peas. 
"They are my favorite vegetable," he says, adding that he will prepare them 
alone or mix them into noodles or in stir-fries.  
</P>
<P>
 Lee also enjoys the shiny purple Japanese eggplant. This he slices and sautes 
with beef, pork or tofu. Two popular varieties are ichiban and Long Tom. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashok Saggar, a native of India and an avid gardener, also names Japanese 
eggplant as a favorite vegetable, but he prepares it differently -- adding 
spices and sauteing it with potatoes.  
</P>
<P>
 Saggar said he began growing Oriental vegetables years ago when he moved to 
the United States and couldn't find any of his favorites. On a visit to India, 
he picked up a supply of seeds, came back and started planting.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Saggar and his family enjoy a variety of Oriental vegetables from his 
Newport Beach garden. Among their favorites is the Chinese bitter melon ( foo 
gwah ), a long, pale-green lumpy vegetable that is bitter even after it's been 
cooked. Saggar likes the bitter melon cut into small pieces and cooked with 
onions, tomatoes and spices.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese winter melon ( doong gwah ) has white firm flesh, and some say it 
looks like a watermelon. Although the Chinese typically make winter melon soup 
with this vegetable, Saggar has a very different use for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grate the entire winter melon, including the skin, and mix it with ground 
lentils and spices," he says. "Then we use the mixture to make small cakes, 
which we dry in the sun for a week." 
</P>
<P>
 These rock-hard cakes can be reconstituted in water and will keep for a couple 
of years if stored properly in an airtight jar, he says. They are considered a 
delicacy and impart great flavor to many dishes.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An unusual variety of bean found in many Oriental vegetable gardens is the 
yard-long bean ( dow gauk ). 
</P>
<P>
 This dark-green Chinese bean can grow to 18 inches long. Saggar likes them, he 
says, because even when cooked, they do not become mushy like other beans. He 
cuts them into small pieces and adds spices, onions and fresh ginger. 
</P>
<P>
 Saggar says the Oriental ginger root he likes to grow flavors nearly every 
dish his wife makes. This is a bulb that grows in the ground for a year and is 
harvested in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustard greens are another Asian delicacy found in many dishes. They are used 
like spinach and can be eaten raw or cooked and mixed into different dishes.  
</P>
<P>
 Another basic vegetable is the daikon, a radish that can grow up to two feet 
long. These are eaten cooked and raw and are commonly used in soups, stir-fries 
and salads. 
</P>
<P>
 To plant Oriental vegetables, seeds are your best choice because they are 
economical and more readily available than plants, although you can find some 
plants in nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 Warm-season plants such as eggplants, cucumbers, melons, tomatoes, beans and 
peppers can be seeded in the next month or so indoors and will be ready for 
transplant in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool-season crops such as snow peas and mustard greens can be seeded directly 
in the ground now and should give a crop before the weather gets too warm.  
</P>
<P>
 When seeding indoors, make sure to use a light potting mix that is high in 
vermiculite and/or perlite, or add these ingredients to lighten your potting 
soil. Let the seeds germinate in a sunny window, and once the plants come up, 
slowly introduce them to the outdoors.  
</P>
<P>
 Before planting Oriental vegetables, soil preparation is very important. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secret to good vegetables is the soil itself," says Saggar, who has 
worked on improving his soil for 10 years. He uses homemade compost and 
fertilizes with composted rabbit and chicken manure.  
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that many of these plants do best in acid soils. In Orange 
County, soil tends to be alkaline. Nurseryman Kawaratani suggests having your 
soil tested by taking a sample to your local nursery or testing it yourself. 
You want the pH to be 6.0 to 6.5.  
</P>
<P>
 To acidify an alkaline soil, there are several amendments you can use, 
including gypsum, which besides lowering pH will lighten heavy clay soil. Leaf 
mold and soil sulfur will also acidify soil. Other good soil lighteners include 
planter's mix, sand, vermiculite and redwood compost. 
</P>
<P>
 Planting location for your vegetables is also important. In general, Oriental 
vegetables require an average of seven hours of sun a day. Some plants such as 
leaf crops can often go with a little less sun, and some fruiting vegetables 
such as eggplant often need all-day sun to do well.  
</P>
<P>
 Many Oriental vegetables thrive in containers, says Kawaratani, who suggests 
using no smaller than a 15-gallon pot. Be careful not to crowd the vegetables 
when planting in containers or the ground, he cautions, as overcrowding will 
lead to reduced yields.  
</P>
<P>
 A 15-gallon container will comfortably hold just one eggplant, a couple snow 
pea plants, one kohlrabi and a couple heads of bok choy, Kawaratani says.  
</P>
<P>
 Fertilize your Oriental vegetable plants on a regular basis with a general 
all-purpose fertilizer. Kawaratani suggests looking for a ratio of 2-1-1 when 
the plant is growing and then switching to 1-2-1 or 1-2-2 once the plant starts 
fruiting.  
</P>
<P>
 One drawback to our mild, almost perpetual growing season is the constant 
presence of pests, which Kawaratani says are able to over-winter in the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent pest damage, keep all vegetables away from the soil. It's also a 
good idea to regularly visually inspect your vegetables and pull off any pests. 
</P>
<P>
 If the infestation is too heavy, try spraying the plants with water, which is 
particularly effective with aphids, or bring in friendly pest predators, such 
as ladybugs. If these methods don't work, try an insecticidal soap.  
</P>
<P>
 Keep plant roots cool in summer by mulching with products such as planter mix 
and homemade compost, and watering on a regular basis. A drip irrigation system 
is often the most expedient method. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Oriental vegetable seeds and even plants are becoming easier to 
obtain, you may want to save your own seeds, as Saggar does. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a complete supply of seeds and never buys unless he finds a new 
variety.  
</P>
<P>
 To save Oriental vegetable seeds, Saggar says, toward the end of a plant's 
growing season single out a piece or two of produce that is healthy and large 
and leave it alone, allowing it to grow big and dry out some.  
</P>
<P>
 Just before the vegetable starts to burst, pick the produce, cut it open and 
spread the seeds on a paper towel. Separate the seeds from the pulp and place 
them in the sun to dry for a couple days.  
</P>
<P>
 Then store the seeds in labeled plastic bags and put them in the refrigerator.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: 2-CHANNEL CORDLESS PHONE HAS DIFFICULTY GETTING 
CLEAR SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I have a 5-year-old cordless telephone that works great; however, 
lately I've been getting a lot of interference on the line. It sounds like 
another conversation my neighbors are having on their phone. Is there anything 
I can do to the phone to prevent it from picking up other conversations? 
</P>
<P>
 D.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "I'd guess that yours is probably a two-channel phone," says telephone 
installer Frank Slemons of Anaheim. "These phones have become so popular lately 
that by using the two-channel models, you just won't get a clear signal. Most 
cordless models today have 10 channels, which gives you a much better chance of 
finding a channel that's clear. Other than switching to a new phone, you could 
try moving it to various places in the house where you could find better 
reception." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'd like to paint the interior of my house, and I want to paint the outlets 
and outlet covers to match the rooms. Do these need to be prepared in some 
special way? 
</P>
<P>
 S.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 A: "First of all, turn the power off to the room you're working on," says 
Barbara Brobst of Hal's Paint & Decorating in Fullerton. "You should remove the 
outlet covers and wash them to remove any dust and dirt. Be sure to also clean 
off the outlets themselves. Paint over them lightly with a good brush. Using 
too thick a coat could make it a problem sticking things into the outlet." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I want to put a wallpaper border up in one of our bedrooms that has already 
been papered. The room has a vaulted ceiling that slants upward. Should I put 
the border along the ceiling or should I drop it lower, where the ceiling 
rises? 
</P>
<P>
 R.E. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Normally, a border follows the lower point in the ceiling and goes all the 
way around the room," says Gene Teramura of Dutch Boy Home Decorating Center in 
Santa Ana. "So if the ceiling is eight feet at its lowest point, the border 
would be applied eight feet high around the room. But, of course, if you like 
the look of the border slanting up to follow the ceiling, you can do it. Also, 
remember that you'll need to use a vinyl adhesive when applying the border to 
paper that's already up, otherwise it won't attach very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have an 8-year-old refrigerator that works except for the light bulb. 
Over the past year and a half, we've had to replace three of them. What could 
be the reason? 
</P>
<P>
 W.W. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
 A: "The problem may not be the refrigerator," says Tom Houlihan of Orange 
County Appliance Parts in Garden Grove. "Usually if there's a short in the 
system, the bulb will burn out immediately. I'd check first to see what kind of 
bulbs you're using. You should be getting appliance bulbs that are designed to 
work in the heat of ovens or the cold of refrigerators.  
</P>
<P>
 "Also, make sure you're getting brand-name bulbs; the cheaper ones don't 
usually last as long. Other than that, make sure your racks are arranged so 
that bottles or cartons aren't hitting the bulb area when you're pulling things 
out of the refrigerator." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: On the second floor of our house, we get all kinds of squeaks when walking 
in various rooms. We're going to be putting in new carpeting soon, and I'd like 
to pull our old carpet up now and correct any problems with the subfloor. I 
could hammer down any nails that have popped up, but wouldn't it be better to 
use screws? 
</P>
<P>
 L.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 A: "If the squeaking is coming from those boards that have popped up over 
time, you probably will notice a difference if they're screwed down," says 
carpenter Nick Howard of Santa Ana. "If they're screwed in, they're less likely 
to be pried upward over time. Drill a pilot hole before trying to drill the 
screw in, and be sure you walk the floor carefully before putting the new 
carpeting down to make sure your squeaking problem is gone."

GARDENING; CHECKING YOUR METHODS IS FAR FROM MADNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever you try something new in gardening, it makes sense to devise ways to 
determine whether it made a difference. Otherwise, you can never be sure that 
it is worth repeating. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you plan to try different pansies, grow some of last season's 
types alongside the new ones. That will provide a side-by-side reference. 
</P>
<P>
 Or in applying a mulch, leave some plants without any. Did those that weren't 
mulched need watering more often? Did the mulch attract damaging insects? Did 
it improve the appearance of the garden? 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if considering a new fertilizer, use the regular type on half the plants 
and the new one on the others. Then judge the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers use double-blind tests on such projects. Gardeners need nothing 
that elaborate. If you feel the new approach was better, you can safely adopt 
it for your conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 But this does require observation. And unless there is some check, there is no 
way to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, it could just mean that the season was particularly good and 
everything would have performed as well anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't be influenced by the "we-have-always-done-it-that-way" factor. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, take the recommended way to dig holes for new plants. For 
generations, the method of choice was a hole about twice the diameter and depth 
of the root ball and the blending of at least 33% soil amendments, such as peat 
moss, into the backfill. 
</P>
<P>
 But the University of Arizona's Jimmy L. Tipton says "new research clearly 
shows traditional techniques aren't best for new plants." He says they work 
against the desirable, quick establishment of a wide, lateral root system that 
supports a plant and absorbs water and nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
 What's better, he believes, is no amended backfill and a planting hole no 
deeper than the root ball but three to five times its diameter. He feels that 
roots will not extend easily beyond a highly amended backfill and, besides 
that, most native soil has a higher water-holding capacity, promoting growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinc sulfate has been touted as a way to control thrips on roses by applying a 
cup under the bush before the bloom period. Try it on half of your roses and 
see if it makes a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 In much of the West, many professionals believe gypsum (calcium sulfate) will 
help cure many soil problems, much as lime does in the East. One common test of 
gypsum's effectiveness is to use a stick to mark a 5-by-5-foot piece of ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Gypsum is sprinkled on one half and nothing on the other half. Both halves are 
watered normally. After the soil dries, gypsum advocates say you will see that 
the gypsum-covered soil will be puffier and looser looking. 
</P>
<P>
 But where sodium in soil or water is not a problem, this won't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Epsom salts provide another example. Many rose growers swear by the 
effectiveness of this soluble form of magnesium sulfate. Plants do need trace 
amounts and magnesium is a little bit stronger than sodium in clinging to soil, 
so it can replace the sodium. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many experts consider gypsum and Epsom salts worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 So it seems to depend on local conditions. Which brings us back to square one: 
Make your own tests and keep records.

DO-IT-YOURSELF; RESTORE HARDWOOD FLOOR, START TO FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you decide to tackle restoring a worn hardwood floor that has a clear 
finish, plan on a week's worth of work. 
</P>
<P>
 You will need a day to prepare the space and gather materials and tools, 
another to sand and several more to apply the finish and allow drying time 
between coats. You can save time by asking someone to help you. Preparation and 
Tools 
</P>
<P>
 If a finish is severely damaged and the flooring is at least one-fourth inch 
thick, it should be stripped with a sander before refinishing. You can rent 
equipment. A drum-type floor sander handles most of the floor refinishing. Use 
a hand-held disc sander, or edger, to sand stair treads and along baseboards, 
in corners, inside closets and in other places that are inaccessible to the 
large drum sander. Hand-sand spots that neither sander reaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Have a salesperson show you how to operate the machines and how to change the 
sandpaper. Stock up on sandpaper and be sure that you have the right tools for 
attaching the sandpaper to the sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare for sanding by removing all rugs, furniture and other furnishings in 
the room. Carefully take off the quarter-round shoe moldings along the 
baseboards. (Number the moldings and their places on the wall so that you can 
put them back.) Cover all vents. Seal doorways and windows from the rest of the 
house with plastic sheeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspect the floor carefully. Pull out any staples left from carpeting. Drive 
any visible nailheads one-eighth inch below the surface using a nail set and 
fill the holes with wood putty. Repair cracks and secure loose floorboards. 
Vacuum and thoroughly inspect the floor once more. Sanding 
</P>
<P>
 For sanding, wear goggles, a dust mask and ear protection. To avoid marring 
the floor, don heavy socks or clean, white-soled sneakers. Remember that 
sanding dust, finishes and finish fumes are flammable. Don't smoke. Extinguish 
pilot lights on nearby appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Sand the floor first with the drum sander and 36-grit paper. Raise the sander 
off the floor, turn on the power, then lower the drum carefully, keeping a firm 
grip on the handles. Work across the floor -- always with the grain -- then 
return to the beginning and strip the next section parallel to and slightly 
overlapping the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an industrial drum floor sander is like walking a headstrong dog. Your 
job is to let it pull you, but not as fast as it can. Always keep the machines 
moving or the sander will "eat down" into the floor and leave an uneven 
surface. Wearing work gloves will ease the pressure on your hands. Repeat the 
sanding process twice, using 80-grit sandpaper, then 100-grit paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, sand along the walls with the edger. Hold both handles firmly and keep 
the disc flat on the floor to avoid gouging. Sand with the same succession of 
paper grades as you used on the main floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a block of wood wrapped with sandpaper or a paint scraper to clean even 
the tightest areas -- in corners and under radiators -- where neither power 
sander can reach. Finally, hand-sand, working with the grain, to remove swirls 
caused by the edger. Vacuum thoroughly between sanding stages. Apply Finish 
</P>
<P>
 After sanding, vacuum the floor and walls using the brush attachment. Wipe 
down moldings, windowsills and door frames so that dust won't fall off later 
and mar the finish. Let dust settle overnight, then vacuum again. Wipe the 
floor thoroughly with a tack cloth, available in hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want floors to be only slightly darker than the bare wood, apply 
sealant of any kind. If you want the finish to have a darker tone, apply wood 
stain before the sealant. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil-base polyurethane is a popular floor finish because of its durability and 
ease of application. You need three coats when you use polyurethane as the 
final finish. Thin the first coat with one part mineral spirits to four parts 
polyurethane; this acts as a sealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Brush polyurethane across the grain and then along it. Use a long-handled 
roller to apply the finish on the main surface of the floor; use a small brush 
for the edges and corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Work in small sections, overlapping the strokes before the previous section is 
dry. Inexpensive foam rollers are best; just throw them away instead of 
cleaning them between coats. 
</P>
<P>
 Let each coat dry as directed before re-coating; observe ventilation 
precautions on the container. In between coats, buff with a rented 
floor-polishing machine equipped with superfine steel wool. After each buffing, 
vacuum well and clean with a tack cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow the finish to dry at least two days, then buff with superfine steel wool 
again and vacuum.

HOME SAFETY; EXTINGUISHER CAN SAVE POSSESSIONS AS WELL AS LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire extinguishers are important safety precautions that every home should 
have. Quick use of an extinguisher on a small fire can prevent it from becoming 
a serious blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 In case of a larger fire, always call the fire department first. Never try to 
fight it by yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 If a small fire begins to spread, have everyone leave the house immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three categories of fire -- A, B and C -- by which fire 
extinguishers are rated. Each kind of fire is extinguished differently: 
</P>
<P>
 * "A" fires burn to ash. They are fueled by wood, cloth, paper, most rubbish 
and some plastics. Water will put them out. 
</P>
<P>
 * "B" fires bubble. They involve flammable liquids and grease. Most kitchen 
fires are of this type. Never throw water on them; it will only splatter and 
spread the flames. For oven or broiler fires, turn off the heat and shut the 
door. If meat catches fire, put a lid over it. If the fire is on top of the 
stove, turn off the burner if possible, leave the pan where it is and smother 
the flames with a lid. Or douse the fire with handfuls of baking soda or salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Never put baking powder, sugar or flour on a fire. Sugar will burn and baking 
powder or flour dust may explode. 
</P>
<P>
 * "C" fires involve electrical power. These occur in electrical wiring or 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Unplug the appliance or shut off the power and use an all-purpose ("ABC") fire 
extinguisher. Never throw water on a "C" fire; a serious shock or even 
electrocution may result. 
</P>
<P>
 An extinguisher's letter rating -- A, B, or C, or a combination of two or 
three -- indicates what kind of fires it can put out. The number preceding the 
letter rating, for example 1-A or 5-B, indicates the size of a standard test 
fire that the extinguisher can put out; the higher the number, the greater the 
extinguisher's firefighting capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire extinguishers are available in rechargeable and non-rechargeable 
(disposable) types. An extinguisher that cannot be recharged or that doesn't 
have a gauge is not as reliable as a rechargeable type. If you have a 
disposable extinguisher, it's a good idea to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rechargeable fire extinguishers are best because they have a gauge that 
indicates the pressure in the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspect the pressure gauge periodically. If the pressure drops, or if the 
extinguisher is used even briefly, have it recharged by an extinguisher service 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Before buying a fire extinguisher, check to see that it is easy to handle, 
especially by an elderly person or a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure that the operating directions, located on the canister, are clear. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also important that the extinguisher carry the Underwriter's Laboratory 
(UL) or Factory Mutual (FM) seal of approval. This indicates that the 
extinguisher model has been tested and provides the protection claimed on the 
label. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Install extinguishers in the kitchen and in or near the living room, bedrooms, 
basement and garage. Locate them in plain view, away from but convenient to 
fire hazards. Make sure the entire family knows how to use them. Keep one 
nearby when you are doing chores such as spray painting or car repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 For a car, select a 2 1/2-pound dry-chemical fire extinguisher (rated for 
class A, B, and C fires) to fight small interior fires that might be caused by 
a stray ash or an electrical malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the extinguisher inside the car, under the front seat or in the glove 
compartment. In the time it would take to retrieve the extinguisher from the 
trunk, the fire could be out of control.

WHAT THE OWNER SEES AS 'CHARM' COULD TURN OFF A POTENTIAL BUYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'DELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've grown accustomed to that crack in the ceiling, and you don't notice it 
anymore. The shrubs and bushes you put in 10 years ago may look overgrown to 
someone else; to you they're familiar friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that you want to sell, it's time to look at your home as a potential 
buyer would. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents and designers offer some tips on how to go about it: 
</P>
<P>
 * Stand at the curb and take a hard look at the exterior. Is the driveway 
greasy or cracked? Does the house need painting? Sometimes just painting the 
fascia and trim will do the trick. Add some bright flowers to the landscaping. 
Real estate agent Carlos Herrera says red, white and yellow blooms are the 
favorites. If the landscaping is in bad condition, it may be time to replace 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check the condition of the entryway flooring, then look up. Potential buyers 
always look up when going through a house, Herrera says. Cobwebs, ceiling 
cracks, water stains and aging light fixtures might be right in their line of 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is the wallpaper dated or too bold? If so, it should come down and be 
replaced by white, not off-white, paint or maybe a faux painting treatment to 
add depth. Never add new wallpaper, advises designer Walter Nutting, who says 
he has seen many cases where the homeowner installed new wallpaper to sell the 
house only to have the new buyer declare that it would be the first thing to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 * Are the appliances and ovens clean? Real estate agent Tom Nash says many 
buyers routinely look in the refrigerator. They believe its condition is a sign 
of how clean the rest of the house is. It's the same with shower stalls, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is there a lingering odor? Homeowners who have indoor pets should buy pet 
deodorizer and use it often. Nothing turns people off more than pet odors, says 
designer Betty Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is it dark inside? Nash recommends increasing the wattage in all lamps and 
turning on every light in the house, even on a sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Are window coverings heavy or outdated? Light and bright are today's 
preferred look. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove ashes from the fireplace. In winter, have fire burning; in summer, 
ferns or flowers can add fresh touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees on what buyers are looking for when they go through a 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Joan Linder says they are trying to see themselves in the home, which 
is why it is so important to remove family photographs, she says. "If there's 
already a family there, it doesn't work," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nutting says people are so used to going through new home models that they are 
comparing the home and the furniture with "the latest thing at Pelican Hill." 
He says houses sell better empty rather than furnished. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers generally breeze through the living room if it's a decent size and head 
for the kitchen and bathrooms, he said. Those rooms are what really date a 
house, and fairly simple changes such as refacing or repainting cabinets or 
replacing old tile counters can have a big impact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agent Nancy Gromme says most home shoppers have some piece of 
furniture in mind that they are trying to place in the room. "If they come from 
back East, they often have huge bedroom sets, and that can sometimes be a 
problem," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash says people have so many houses to choose from that what they are doing 
is eliminating, finding a reason why that house won't work for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's buyers, Nutting says, want to move in and not have to fix anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years back, people would buy 'charm' and spend time and money fixing it 
up. Those days are gone," he says. LYNN O'DELL

DESIGN; LIGHT FIXTURES OF COPPER AND OAK ARE SHINING EXAMPLES OF ARTS AND 
CRAFTS 
</P>

<P>
 There is a resurgence of interest in the straightforward furniture of the Arts 
and Crafts movement, but collectors who want to re-create this 
turn-of-the-century style in their homes face a dilemma -- finding appropriate 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Lighting in the Arts and Crafts era was produced by factories in a wide range 
of lighting styles, including Arts and Crafts, and by individual craftspeople 
who specialized in high-quality, handcrafted lamps and lighting fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best-known craftsman was Dirk van Erp (1860-1933), a metalsmith 
who emigrated from the Netherlands in 1886 and settled in San Francisco. By 
1910 he had developed a reputation as a skilled coppersmith and lighting 
designer. His unique lamps, from 12 to 24 inches high, featured hand-hammered 
copper bases and mica shades. 
</P>
<P>
 By treating copper with various chemicals, van Erp produced a reddish-brown 
patina that was complemented by the orangish hue of the mica. The result was a 
warm glow that provided light while virtually eliminating the harsh glare of 
the electric bulb. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Erp's shopmark -- the metalsmith's name below the outline of a windmill -- 
can command more than $50,000 today for the largest and rarest lamps, while 
smaller, more modest lamps go for $5,000 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Such furniture manufacturers as Gustav Stickley, Charles Limbert and Elbert 
Hubbard also offered lamps in the Arts and Crafts style, produced by skilled 
woodworkers and metalsmiths who created handcrafted lighting fixtures destined 
to last for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the lighting fixtures from Stickley's Craftsman Workshops were 
constructed either of hammered copper or quartersawn oak, with natural wicker 
shades lined with silk. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest number of signed Arts and Crafts lighting fixtures were produced 
by Hubbard's Roycroft Copper Shop in East Aurora, N.Y. Credit for the 
development of the Roycroft Copper Shop goes to Karl Kipp, who arrived in 1908 
and demonstrated a natural ability to both design and craft a variety of copper 
items, from letter openers to massive chandeliers. The table lamps he designed 
and produced for Roycroft feature hand-hammered bases and shades. 
</P>
<P>
 When it became clear that the Arts and Crafts style was more than a passing 
fad, lighting manufacturers that had previously been producing Victorian, 
Colonial and other popular styles began incorporating Arts and Crafts designs 
into their inventories. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of these lighting fixtures -- table lamps, wall sconces and 
ceiling lights -- were made of oak. Their shades generally were fitted with 
sheets of colored glass, making them far more affordable than the 
hammered-copper and mica lamps or the Tiffany-style stained-glass lamps. The 
most popular colors of glass were amber and green. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for even the most basic Arts and Crafts table lamp, consisting of a 
square base, a single square post and a four-sided slag-glass shade, has driven 
prices from the $50-$100 range into the $150-$200 level. Lamps with additional 
detailing can quickly climb into the $250-$500 range. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortage today of affordable period light fixtures has encouraged a number 
of individual craftspeople and lighting manufacturers to produce Arts and 
Crafts-style lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality, designs and prices of these fixtures vary tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
 They range from such coppersmiths as Michael Adams of Oswego, N.Y., and 
Michael Ashford, in Olympia, Wash., who painstakingly retrace van Erp's work to 
produce hand-hammered copper-and-mica lamps, to lighting manufacturers who 
stamp out or import poorly made reproductions.

HOME SAFETY; YOUNG CHILDREN RUN GREATEST RISK OF PLANT POISONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One in 10 inquiries to poison control centers across the nation concern plant 
poisonings. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest danger from poisoning is to young children -- who like to taste 
everything as part of their explorations of the world around them. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the plant-related inquiries to poison centers concern children 
younger than 3 years; in only a small percentage of these cases does the child 
actually have symptoms of poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Philodendron and diffenbachia are responsible for the first and second most 
reported poisonings, respectively. These plants are in the Araceae family, a 
group of plants with needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate in the leaves and 
stems. 
</P>
<P>
 When chewed, the crystals cause immediate pain in the mouth and throat, which 
commonly leads to swelling. This makes speech difficult and is the origin for 
the common name dumbcane for diffenbachia species. 
</P>
<P>
 If enough philodendron or diffenbachia leaves are eaten, vomiting and 
diarrhea, even death, could follow. Other houseplants in this family include 
elephant's ear (Alocasia spp.), flamingo flower (Anthurium spp.) and caladium 
(Caladium bicolor). 
</P>
<P>
 Poinsettias are ranked third as far as the number of reported (not actual) 
poisonings nationwide. Actually, poinsettias are not poisonous -- but they have 
a reputation for being so. While the poinsettia is not toxic, it is a member of 
the spurge family, which includes many toxic plants. Guilt by association, 
perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the spurge family contain a milky latex in their sap, and this 
latex can cause dermatitis. A houseplant spurge that does warrant caution is 
the crown-of-thorns, which, as long as we are talking about danger to children, 
also is heavily armed with stout thorns. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bulbs are in the lily family, another family with many poisonous members. 
The daintiness of lily of the valley belies the fact that it contains a potent 
cardiac glycoside (much like the digitalis found in foxgloves), which even 
leaches into the water of cut flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyacinths are wonderfully fragrant, yet also toxic. All parts of daffodils 
contain lycorine, a toxic substance that can cause dermatitis with skin contact 
and diarrhea and convulsions if ingested. Lycorine is also found in another 
winter bulb, amaryllis (Hippeastrum spp.). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few other houseplants in widely scattered plant families also are toxic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jerusalem cherry ( Solanum pseudocapsicum ), a houseplant with brightly 
colored berries, is in the deadly nightshade family. The family name tells you 
something about the plant's toxic properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistletoe is not a houseplant, per se, yet it is a plant often in the house in 
wintertime. The white berries, which tend to fall to the ground as the plants 
dry, are toxic. The leaves of English ivy, grown indoors and out, are toxic 
also. 
</P>
<P>
 No need to cast a somber cloud over these houseplants. But it is important to 
know which are toxic so as to keep them beyond the inquisitive reach of very 
young hands.  
</P>
<P>
 If a child does ingest a plant, save part of the plant for positive 
identification, then call a poison control center. It is not always advisable 
to induce vomiting, as this can further spread irritating materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Now why does an otherwise friendly looking philodendron have to strike a 
menacing chord with a toxin in its leaves? 
</P>
<P>
 Inside our homes, over-watering or under-watering probably is the biggest 
threat to any houseplant's existence. 
</P>
<P>
 But out in the jungle, a philodendron needs some way to ward off a big gorilla 
who might find the leaves an appetizing salad. In this case, a burning, swollen 
mouth is a good deterrent.

MAINTENANCE; TO FIGHT STAINS, TRY A HOME REMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To avoid airing your dirty household linens in public, you may want to try 
simple household remedies to either eliminate or lighten most spots caused by 
foods, beverages and other familiar offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases a stain or a spot should be treated before you wash the item, 
and as soon as possible after the stain has occurred. Early treatment 
facilitates stain removal and limits damage to fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Eckert, a designer who also restores vintage quilts, recommended this 
formula for lightening the brown spots and yellowed areas on old linens: Add a 
few drops of lemon juice and distilled water to a touch of Orvus, a mild 
PH-neutral cleanser recommended for washable textiles, to form a runny paste. 
Wet the stained area, dab on the mixture and let it set for 15 minutes. Rinse 
the item thoroughly in warm water. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert warned against using the mixture on colored linens, because the acid in 
the lemon can lighten or remove color. 
</P>
<P>
 English author Jane Newdick found a list of cleaning recipes in an old book, 
which included this one: Broil rhubarb stems, strain the juice and dab it, 
while still hot, on the stain. Then wash the item immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhubarb treats stains effectively because it contains oxalic acid, an antidote 
for many of the brown spots found on vintage linen and cotton textiles.

 Textile conservator Nancy Lane Terry, a member of the American Institute of 
Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, warns that you should work 
carefully when applying to fabric any agent that contains acid. In general, it 
is best to use a weak solution. 
</P>
<P>
 If you own a valuable or fragile textile, it is best to determine what caused 
the stain before attempting to remove it. If you cannot identify the cause or 
you are afraid to try to remove the stain yourself, consult a textile 
conservator. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Durkson Clise, author of "The Linen Closet: How to Care for Your Fine 
Linens and Lace," offers a range of antidotes for common stains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Coffee and tea. If you are able to treat the stain immediately, apply a 
solution of one part borax and six parts water to the item. Wash in warm, soapy 
water using a gentle cleanser. If the stain has already dried, loosen it with 
an application of one part glyceride and one part water. To remove stains on 
sturdy fabrics, stretch the area over a bowl and pour a stream of boiling water 
through the stain from a height of 2 to 3 feet until the spot disappears. 
</P>
<P>
 * Berries, sand and fruit. To treat a wet stain, sprinkle the area with salt 
and rub it with damp soap. Allow to stand for a few hours, then rinse well. For 
dried stains, soak the item in a solution of one part borax and six parts 
water. For sturdy fabrics, you can also use the boiling-water technique. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wine. You can usually remove white wine stains with a hot, soapy washing. To 
treat red wine stains, sprinkle salt on the area and immerse the item in cold 
water. If the spot remains, rub it out with salt before washing the item. 
Another remedy for red wine stains is to saturate the area with club soda or a 
solution of baking soda and water.

ELECTRONICS; COMPONENTS CAN BE SPARED SHOCK OF VOLTAGE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Video enthusiasts pour much money and time into their equipment, yet valuable 
units are often left vulnerable to electrical damage. There are several 
products that can protect electronic components and even improve their 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem, under-voltage, occurs when there is a drop below the consistent 
120 volts normally supplied by utility companies. This situation produces 
temporary losses that, although they typically last only a fraction of a 
second, may upset the workings of personal computers and videocassette 
recorders. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the damage caused by under-voltage, users can buy an 
uninterruptible power supply for about $200 to $400 that enables the equipment 
to keep running long enough to be shut down properly. A UPS can also prevent 
VCR timers from "blacking out," ensuring that the system retains programmed 
information even during a prolonged power loss. 
</P>
<P>
 A far more dangerous problem, over-voltage, occurs when power flows into 
circuit boards faster than it can be dissipated. An over-voltage, also known as 
a surge or spike, can produce 6,500 volts, meaning that it has the potential to 
burn a system. Surge suppressors provide a safeguard by absorbing or rerouting 
excess electrical energy during overvoltages. 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems are known as radio frequency interference and electromagnetic 
interference. These cause audio buzzing and video distortion in the form of 
diagonal lines and static. RFI and EMI are most commonly produced by such 
sources as local radio stations, cellular phones and household appliances. Many 
surge suppressors include line conditioners that minimize or eliminate RFI and 
EMI noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Surge suppressors come in a variety of forms, with prices from $5 to more than 
$500. Prospective buyers should make sure the unit they choose has an 
Underwriters Laboratories 1449 listing, which means that the product meets 
minimum safety requirements for its intended use. 
</P>
<P>
 As for warranties, on some of the more expensive units these will cover not 
only the surge suppressor but also the equipment being protected by it. Special 
groundings or hookups may be necessary for the warranty to be valid, however. 
</P>
<P>
 For further protection, many insurance policies will cover electrical spike 
damage, and special riders and schedules are available for additional coverage.

O.C. STUDENT'S DISAPPEARANCE BAFFLES FAMILY, FRIENDS, POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The disappearance of Cathy Torrez doesn't make sense to anyone. Not to her 
family, the police, her teachers, her friends or her bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people run away all the time, they say, but not those like Torrez. 
</P>
<P>
 An honor student at Cal State Fullerton who also holds two jobs, the 
20-year-old Torrez calls her mother if she's going out after work. She has 
never been in trouble, used drugs or barhopped, they say. There are no angry 
ex-boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did Torrez disappear a week ago during her one-mile drive home from 
work? There is no evidence that she ran away or was abducted. She and her 
burgundy Toyota Corolla, license plate 2RMC785, simply vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Earth couldn't have just opened up and swallowed her," her mother, Mary 
Bennett, said Friday. Torrez lives with her mother, stepfather, a brother and 
one of her two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives and friends took calls from well-wishers Friday and distributed 
thousands of flyers to volunteers who are papering north Orange County. A 
week-old letter from a Cal State Fullerton dean congratulating Torrez on making 
last semester's honor roll sits on a table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who knows her knows she wouldn't just go away," Bennett said. 
"Something had to have happened to her, but we don't know what." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has Placentia police baffled. Her bank accounts haven't been touched, 
even though she only had $30 and no credit cards with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have followed leads, but there has been nothing to indicate foul play," 
Placentia police Detective Donna Rose said. "But she is not the type of 
20-year-old who would just leave, and that has us concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and family say that about 7:50 p.m. Feb. 12, Torrez called her mother 
from the Sav-On Drugs store at Bradford Avenue and Yorba Linda Boulevard, where 
she has worked for almost four years as a checker, and indicated she would be 
home shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8 p.m., the 4-foot-10 Torrez walked out of Sav-On to her car with a female 
co-worker, said "see you in the morning," and drove out of the lot, heading 
south on Bradford. Then she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 If she was going home, she would taken Bradford for one mile, passing several 
homes and apartments, Valencia High School -- her alma mater and other employer 
-- and St. Joseph's Catholic Church, where she would have slowed and blessed 
herself with the sign of the cross, her mother said. She would have stopped at 
one stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chapman Avenue, she would have stopped at a light, turned west and driven 
one block to her home. The trip should have taken five minutes at the longest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been back and forth, over and under everything in her life and there 
is nothing that tells us she wouldn't want to come home," said Ron Bennett, her 
stepfather. "It's confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez's mother sat patiently through one television interview after another 
in her living room Friday night, trying to get the word out about her 
daughter's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at the kitchen table, she said she sometimes thinks she hears her 
daughter at night tapping on her bedroom window. Debbie, Torrez's 13-year-old 
sister, awakens sometimes thinking Torrez is whispering to her. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, Bennett calls everyone who knows her daughter, trying to find 
a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless somebody is lying, no one has heard from her," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Lopez, Torrez's 22-year-old sister, keeps a log of everyone who has been 
contacted. She's convinced her sister wouldn't go anyplace alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "She couldn't go anywhere or do anything alone by herself," Lopez said, "not 
even the store. She would try to get somebody to go and if they couldn't, she 
wouldn't go. She couldn't even eat alone. She would make one of us come and sit 
with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Sav-On co-worker Lisa Ripley said that "except when she drove to work, I never 
saw her alone." 
</P>
<P>
 In front of Sav-On on Friday, Martin Torrez, her 19-year-old brother, was 
passing out flyers -- as he has every day since her disappearance -- hoping to 
find a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say they know her," he said as he handed a flyer to another 
Sav-On customer. "They all tell me how nice she is." 
</P>
<P>
 At Valencia High, where Torrez worked as a teacher's aide last semester, 
teacher Clara Rodriguez-Creger said she "is not the flighty type who would just 
take off. She cares too much about her family to leave without even a phone 
call. She is very responsible, and that is what is frightening to anyone who 
knows her." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Bennett says she just wants to know what happened, even if it turns out 
to be bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to know," Bennett said. "We will never be able to get on with our 
lives until we find out."

 ICE TRY: Maybe the gods weren't pleased. In an ice carving exhibition at the 
Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, Newport Beach's Mark Daukas and New Yorker 
Scott Rella sculpted Thor, the Norse god of thunder, from 10 300-pound blocks 
of ice. Daukas, who holds many national and international titles in ice 
carving, was expected to win. But he only got a citation for "innovation." . . 
. . Says a friend: "They were pretty bummed and not really happy with the 
judging." 
</P>
<P>
 FOR SHARON: A highlight of the Orange Coast College Symphony's performance at 
the school's Robert B. Moore Theatre Sunday night will be the seven-minute 
elegy "Ohio Girl." It's packed with meaning. . . . It's Huntington Beach 
composer Jim Weisheit's tribute to his cousin, Sharon Lane, the first Army 
nurse to be killed in the Vietnam War. . . . Says the college's orchestra 
director Alan Remington: "I defy anyone to sit down and listen to it without 
having tears come to their eyes. Jim put his heart and soul into this work." 
</P>
<P>
 DAVE'S SONG: Tony Bennett didn't leave his heart there, so "Seattle on the 
Puget Sound" hasn't caught on as a national treasure. But it's well known in 
Seattle. And native son Dave Holden, a jazz musician who's a regular at the 
Westin South Coast Plaza, wants that city to officially adopt it. He owns the 
rights to the song, written by his father. Says Holden, who lives in Huntington 
Beach: "I've been at this 35 years, and I always play that song. People here 
seem to love it."

 STAYING BUILT: Tonight's Afghan International Concert and Show at UC Irvine's 
Bren Event Center brings together peoples of Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, 
Tajikistan, India and Uzbekistan. They'll perform traditional music and dance 
from each land. Producer Ahmadshah Alam of New York organized the event in part 
to preserve critical but ephemeral aspects of the war-torn region. . . . . Says 
Alam: "You can rebuild the country, the houses, but when you lose the culture, 
you cannot rebuild it."

 GOING MODERN: The headquarters for the Armed Forces Radio and Television 
Network must be a Manhattan or Hollywood high-rise. Wrong! Believe it or not, 
the network broadcasts from Sun Valley in a building originally built as a bank 
computer center.. . . The network, which reaches 1.3 million military personnel 
in 128 countries, plays more Christian rock and fewer Bible services these 
days, and the soldiers like it.(B13)

 SCHOOL LOYALTY: They said they might bail, but the overwhelming majority of 
CalArts students are sticking with the earthquake-ravaged campus. Friday was 
the last day students could withdraw and receive a full refund, but only about 
80 of the 964 left.. . . The school estimates $2 million in bills for satellite 
classrooms and lost tuition. (B20) 
</P>
<P>
 BUMMED BOWLER: Pity Paul Hagerty. Rocket Bowl in Chatsworth, his weekly 
hangout for 14 years, won't reopen till early March because of earthquake 
damage, sending his mood straight into the gutter. "I miss it," he complained. 
"This is my home away from home. Other places charge too much money.". . . 
Besides, many (above) remain closed or overcrowded. (C14) 
</P>
<P>
 MODEL QB: Palmdale High's Rocque Sandoval, who has overcome far more than 
intimidating pass rushers, might find ex-Raider Jim Plunkett a perfect role 
model. Plunkett's parents were blind, yet he became a great player who took his 
team to two Super Bowl titles. . . . Sandoval's parents are deaf, but that 
hasn't stopped him from throwing touchdowns and picking up plenty of support 
from home. (C14) 
</P>
<P>
 EVERYTHING COUNTS: Don't call tonight's taping of "The Jackson Family Honors" 
in Las Vegas a strictly charity event; much of the dough goes to cover 
expenses. (F1) . . . But at least one Valley group, the Permanent Charities 
Committee of the Entertainment Industry in Studio City, will send some money 
raised to quake victims. Michael Arkush

CHAPMAN REVUES THE LATIN ROOTS OF ROCK; MUSIC: UNIVERSITY SHOW TRACES LARGELY 
UNHERALDED ROLE IN RHYTHMS RANGING FROM RAGTIME TO REGGAE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After 20 years of staging rock 'n' roll revues at Chapman University, you'd 
think Paul Frizler would have covered all the bases by now. But when someone 
suggested showcasing the Latin roots of popular music in the United States, 
Frizler was stumped. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there was "La Bamba," Santana and Los Lobos, but beyond that? "I 
thought, 'Oh God, it's going to be a very short show,' " Frizler said. But what 
he found was that music from Latin America and the Caribbean has played a 
surprisingly rich role in popular music, one that goes largely unheralded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the root that nobody explores," Frizler said, as he ticks off the 
Latino influences on performers such as Madonna, Ben E. King, the Police, and 
the group that did "Love Potion No. 9." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, he brings it all together in "From Ragtime to Reggae: The Latin Roots 
of Rock and Roll." Opening tonight in Chapman Auditorium, the splashy revue 
continues for the next three weekends, through March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The original idea for the show came from Allen Levy, an associate professor of 
public relations who had tried to sell it as a TV project a few years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I started researching the actual songs and influences, I noticed two 
things. First, there isn't very much literature" on the subject, Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, he found a much wider influence than even he expected. "What I thought 
was a trickle turned out to be a roaring river," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chronologically, the show ranges from W. C. Handy's 1914 ragtime standard "St. 
Louis Blues" (with its tango-inspired interlude) to such contemporary artists 
as Gloria Estefan and Los Lobos. One of the surprises that greeted Levy in his 
research was the interplay around the end of the 19th Century between tango, 
which swept up from Argentina, and early jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Tango "scandalized white America" because of its overt sexuality, Levy said, 
although a sanitized version later became popular. "Before that, the only 
people who really loved the tango (in the U.S.) were African Americans," Levy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right from there this Latin river flows through all forms of American popular 
music," said Levy, who co-wrote and co-produced the show with Frizler, who 
directs. The point of the revue is "to illuminate and celebrate a trend in 
American popular music that no one has ever revealed, not that I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Levy: "Everybody talks about multiculturalism. It's the buzzword of the 
'90s, right? We are doing something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Latin Roots" show fits right in with the university's current 
"Celebration of Latino Culture," a yearlong project that includes a steady 
calendar of lectures, concerts and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was that we wanted to be able to find a way to bring consciousness 
about various cultures" to the campus, said Cory Salcedo, a Chapman University 
administrator who is coordinating the program. The show, she said, will be a 
central event of the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 As with Frizler's past productions, this is a "clone show," in which costumed 
students and alumni portray the actual performers who sang the hits. Well 
before the "Beatlemania" stage show played across the country and before the 
explosion of Elvis impersonators, Frizler was dressing up his stars and turning 
them into everyone from Peggy Lee to Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 The current show incorporates the research by Frizler and Levy into a 
production that is "painlessly educational," Levy hopes. "It's not just a 
historical travelogue, it's a celebration. We party in this show." 
</P>
<P>
 Opening with Richie Valens' rendition of "La Bamba," a rock 'n' roll 
translation of a Mexican folk tune, the "Latin Roots" show moves into the 
largely unspoken influence of Latin rhythms on such '50s and '60s performers as 
the Clovers ("Love Potion No. 9"), Ben E. King ("Spanish Harlem"), the Drifters 
("Under the Boardwalk") and even Van Morrison, whose "Brown-Eyed Girl" was 
inspired, lyrically and musically, by a trip to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Such roots can be hard to spot, but are undeniably there, especially in the 
rhythms, Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the program reaches back to Handy's "St. Louis Blues" before exploring 
the big-band era, from the Latin influence on mainstream performers (Jimmy 
Dorsey's "Tangerine," for instance) to the Cuban invasion of such stars as Desi 
Arnaz and Xavier Cugat. In the show, Thora Fletcher of Mission Viejo sings a la 
Dinah Washington in a sultry "What a Difference a Day Makes," a hit song that 
was originally written in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 From the pre-rock era until today, Latin music has inspired a succession of 
dance crazes, from the tango and the rumba through to the more recent lambada 
and salsa. The show covers these with a quick history, then explores Cole 
Porter's fascination with the beguine rhythm from Martinique (as in "Night and 
Day"). 
</P>
<P>
 Act One also includes a section on the perpetuation of Latino stereotypes in 
popular music, including "Manana," popularized by Peggy Lee (which exemplifies 
the "lazy Mexican" stereotype, Levy said) and Pat Boone's hit "Speedy 
Gonzalez," with its shifty protagonist and the exaggerated accents of the 
backup singers. ("Rosarita come quickly, down at the Quick Stop they're giving 
Green Stamps with tequila," goes one line.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I was leery of doing it. I wasn't sure the audience would get the ironic 
distance," Levy said. But Frizler, who has explored stereotypes in popular 
music before, was all for including the songs, and they contacted a Latino 
student association on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Frey, president of Macondo, said she finds the approach educational for 
both Latinos and others alike. "It's more objective if you have both sides of 
the coin," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Act Two is heavy on Caribbean influences, starting with calypso and soca (with 
Buster Poindexter's hit remake of "Hot Hot Hot") and moving to reggae. The way 
mainstream performers incorporated these rhythms is a big part of the show: 
there's the Police ("Roxanne"), UB40 ("Red Red Wine"), Blondie ("The Tide Is 
High") and Madonna ("I'm Going Bananas"). 
</P>
<P>
 "La Bamba" is reprised for the closing number, this time as performed by Los 
Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
 The big time spread presents a challenge for performers. Kaja Holland, an 
alumnus appearing in her third production, goes from being one of the Andrews 
Sisters, to Mary Martin to Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of wigs," the brunette said. "I don't get to use my real hair at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Auditions were a monthlong process for Frizler, followed by about six weeks of 
rehearsals. Because Chapman has a strong music department, he said, he has a 
rich pool of vocal talent to draw from, but casting harmony groups such as the 
Andrews Sisters still posed a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally the outgrowth of a fraternity skit, Frizler's musical stage shows 
have over the years turned into a popular celebration of rock's history and 
byways, utilizing almost 100 singers, musicians, dancers and technical people. 
</P>
<P>
 The off-the-cuff, "let's put on a show" spirit of the early days has slowly 
given way to a more polished veneer, but the revue remains an all-volunteer 
labor of love. Many continue to take part in the show long after they leave 
school, although Vicky Miller of Orange holds a particular distinction: She's 
the only person to have appeared in all 20 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 She has watched as the semiannual event has grown in scope, gaining a "bigger 
budget, better equipment, more support from the school," she said. "It used to 
be on a wing and a prayer. Now we've even got a costume budget." 
</P>
<P>
 "I basically do it because it's fun," Miller said, and although the late-night 
rehearsals sometimes test her resolve, "Paul does inspire an incredible amount 
of loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1975 show was billed as a look back at 20 years of rock history, and 
Frizler has updated that every five years since, giving himself a crash course 
in the latest pop trends every time around (the 1990 show included performances 
of songs by such then-new artists as rappers Public Enemy and socially 
conscious folk singer Tracy Chapman). 
</P>
<P>
 In the off years, he's taken time to explore some off-center rock topics, as 
in 1992's satiric revue, "A Comical Look at Rock and Roll and Other Outrageous 
Musical Hilarities." One program explored the African American roots of rock 
'n' roll, an influence that has been much better documented than the Latin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Frizler's revue is now staged every two years, the current show marks 
both the 20th year and the 20th production. That's because, in the beginning, 
Frizler produced a show every semester, a memory that amazes him now. "I can't 
even imagine doing it every year now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said this might be his last production, partly because of all the work, 
partly because he worries about pushing his luck. Most past productions have 
sold out their entire seven-performance runs in the 950-seat hall, and Frizler 
wonders if the streak will someday desert him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've all been too successful," Frizler said. "The law of averages is going 
to catch up with me."

 Pope John Paul II appealed Friday for reconciliation in Nicaragua, where the 
last remnants of Contra rebels have been fighting with the army as the country 
struggles to end decades of guerrilla warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The pontiff asked that Nicaraguans work to "consolidate the democratic process 
and bring about true conditions of peace and justice, which the people of 
Nicaragua aspire to and have a right to." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 200 rebels, the last remnants of the U.S.-backed Contra army that 
battled the leftist Sandinista government for the 1980s, have recently agreed 
to peace talks.

MISSING BOY FOUND; PARENTS ARE JAILED; LAW ENFORCEMENT: POLICE ACCUSE 
BIOLOGICAL MOTHER AND FATHER OF ABDUCTION. CHILD IS OK, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

 A 4-year-old boy who disappeared a week ago from his foster home in Rancho 
Santa Margarita was found Friday with his biological parents, who were arrested 
on suspicion of child abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj Yaser Jayyusi was discovered by sheriff's deputies about 6:45 p.m. Friday 
in a car parked in front of a building at the corner of Studebaker Street and 
Alondra Avenue in Cerritos where his father, Yaser Majed Jayyusi, 55, had gone 
to pick up a paycheck. Also in the car was the boy's mother, Deborah Ann 
Jayyusi, 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parents were taken to the Orange County Jail, where they were being held 
charges of child abduction. Bail was set at $250,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arrest happened without incident," said Lt. Dan Martini. "We can report 
that the boy is in good health and good spirits. He was obviously a little 
shaken over the arrest situation, but he was calmed down very quickly and 
seemed to adapt to the officers at the scene. He seems to be doing very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said that the boy had been taken to Orangewood, a home in Orange for 
abused or abandoned children, and eventually would be released to the custody 
of his foster mother, Susan White, although Martini could not say exactly when 
that would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The case made headlines earlier this week when Taj disappeared from White's 
home, where he had lived since August after being removed from the custody of 
his parents two years ago. While officials would not discuss the reasons for 
the boy's removal, a court hearing to terminate their parental rights had been 
scheduled for last Wednesday and White, 43, already had begun adoption 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the parents moved from their Anaheim home about the time Taj 
disappeared and because the father is a Jordanian national, deputies initially 
feared that the boy had been taken out of the country. Those fears were eased 
somewhat when the youngster was sighted on Wednesday with the Jayyusis in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 White's friends and neighbors, who earlier in the week had crowded into her 
two-bedroom condominium with food, condolences and offers of help, reacted 
Friday with excitement to the news that boy had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 "This abduction was quite traumatic for the entire community," said Diane 
Gaynor, director of public relations for the Santa Margarita Co., which had 
aided in the search. 
</P>
<P>
 A candlelight vigil scheduled for 5 p.m. Sunday at the Santa Margarita Beach 
Club, she said, will now be turned into a celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday night, White was reported to be en route to Orangewood to retrieve 
the little boy. And even normally stoic sheriff's deputies sounded happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real happy ending before this long weekend," Martini said. "We're 
thrilled."

DORNAN ANNOUNCES HE'LL RUN FOR A 9TH TERM IN CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of apparent indecision, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) 
announced Friday that he will seek reelection to a ninth term in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement by the combative conservative to run again in central Orange 
County's 46th Congressional District means a postponement of his plans to seek 
higher office or to begin a career as a talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dornan publicly had been coy in recent weeks about his political 
future, his plans were revealed several weeks ago in a fund-raising letter sent 
to his supporters in which he underscored that this would be his "final race 
for Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask my supporters to ride with me one more time toward the thunder of the 
political battlefield," he said in a campaign statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the usual hoopla that accompanies campaign starts, Dornan's 
announcement was low-key and limited to a two-page press release. Dornan was 
not available for comment, and his statement did not repeat his commitment to 
make this his last campaign for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dornan's press secretary, Brian Keeter, said the congressman strongly 
backs term limits and will honor his pledge to step down after the next term, 
should he be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Dornan said he is running again because he believes Congress 
"will be the primary battlefield" in the conservatives' fight against the 
Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing himself as a "positive and unrelenting force" in Congress for jobs 
creation, a strong national defense and anti-crime measures, Dornan said he 
wants to return to Congress "because I believe that there is still more that I 
can do to improve the quality of life for the citizens of the 46th 
Congressional District and our wonderful country. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 He did not explain his rejection of options he had once considered. These 
included a run for President in 1996, going after the U.S. Senate seat now held 
by Democrat Dianne Feinstein, or seeking a broadcasting contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear he waited until the last minute because this was the last thing he 
wanted to do," said Howard Adler, former chairman of the Orange County 
Democratic Party, who is now head of Beat Bob Inc., a fund-raising committee 
organized last year to defeat Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does not want to represent the people of the 46th," Adler said. "He has 
devoted all of his energy to finding another job. . . . I don't think he 
deserves to keep" the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Democrats said they are determined to make Dornan's current term 
in Congress his last. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46th District, which takes in Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa Ana, is the 
only congressional district in Orange County in which Democrats outnumber 
Republicans in voter registration -- by a margin of 47% to 41.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats see this year's election as an opportunity to capture a seat that 
they lost only narrowly in the 1992 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruised in the 1992 primary contest against moderate Republican Judith M. 
Ryan, Dornan barely held on to win the November election. He received just over 
50% of the vote, even though the Democrat, Robert John Banuelos, rarely 
campaigned and spent only $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Democratic Party officials have since conceded that they mishandled that 
election by ignoring Banuelos. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan "may have been able to slide through the last election; I don't believe 
he will be that lucky this time," Orange County Democratic Party Chairwoman 
Dorianne Garcia said. "I believe the voters in Orange County have wised up to 
just how much he does not represent their interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to Dornan's claim that fighting crime will be his top domestic 
priority, Garcia said: "He does not do anything except get on radio or get in 
the news and say he's anti-crime. I would like to see him on the streets of 
Santa Ana or Anaheim doing something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan is not expected to face major opposition in the June 7 primary. Santa 
Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who announced last year that he would not seek 
reelection, began raising money to enter the Republican primary should Dornan 
step down. As of Friday, no other Republican had filed nomination papers. The 
filing deadline is March 11. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Democratic primary, three candidates have filed so far: Placentia Mayor 
Norman Z. Eckenrode, who ran unsuccessfully for the seat in the Democratic 
primary two years ago; Michael P. Farber, a former San Diego County businessman 
who was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee against Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Oceanside) in 1992; and Don Payne, an Anaheim resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Banuelos has announced his intention to run again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Democratic Party will not officially endorse a candidate in the 
primary, Adler and former state Democratic Party Chairman Richard O'Neill are 
expected to back Farber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mike Farber is setting up to be the strongest candidate we have had 
there in years," Adler said. "I think he will have a successful campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 The Beat Bob committee set $300,000 as its national fund-raising goal to 
defeat Dornan. By the end of 1993, the group had received and spent about 
$40,000, Adler said. More fund-raisers will be held this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler said the campaign came to a standstill at the end of 1993, partly 
because of his poor health. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan's spokesman said the Democratic Party's inability to carry out 
fund-raising shows that there is no steam behind the anti-Dornan campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan himself dismissed the Beat Bob organization when it was formed. In his 
recent fund-raising letter, however, he called it a "potentially destructive 
assault." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though this organization is so low-life, I must say I'm impressed at 
their determination," Dornan stated in his letter seeking campaign 
contributions.

AGENCY FAULTS ITSELF FOR MAJOR TB OUTBREAK; HEALTH: COUNTY OFFICIALS SAY THEY 
FAILED TO PROPERLY MONITOR TUBERCULAR STUDENT WHO DEVELOPED CONTAGIOUS STRAIN 
THAT PROBABLY INFECTED 12 CLASSMATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 County health officials acknowledged Friday that they failed to adequately 
follow the treatment of an Orange County high school student with active 
tuberculosis who probably infected 12 classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said that from what they have learned from the recent TB outbreak at 
La Quinta High School, the Orange County Health Care Agency has initiated 
reforms to assure closer collaboration between the county public health office 
and private physicians and laboratories in the care of tubercular patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have instituted more aggressive systems to assure this will never happen 
again," said Penny Weismuller, the county's manager for disease control. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes come in response to recent critiques of the agency's handling of 
the La Quinta outbreak by the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta 
and the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 After the County Health Care Agency learned in June, 1992, that a student at 
Quinta High School in Westminster had tuberculosis, a county worker made 25 
unsuccessful attempts during a seven-month period to obtain information from 
the girl's physicians about the progress of her treatment, Weismuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, it was determined that the student's erratic practice of taking 
prescribedantibiotics led to her to develop a contagious, mutant form of the 
tuberculosis bacterium that was drug-resistant, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were assuming, maybe it was a false assumption, that the patient was being 
treated adequately," said Dr. Hugh Stallworth, Orange County's public health 
officer. He noted that the student was being seen by both a primary care 
physician and pulmonary specialist who had assured county officials that she 
was not contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state investigators, whom the county invited to critique their 
handling of the tuberculosis outbreak, concluded that the county should have 
been "more aggressive" in its monitoring of the initial infected student, 
Stallworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county ultimately took over the girl's treatment in June when her doctors 
were puzzled why she had a "positive" sputum culture, a sign of active 
tuberculosis, after a year of treatment, Weismuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in September the student was hospitalized because she was violating 
quarantine requirements that she stay out of public places, Weismuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of growing concern that the infected student might be spreading her 
disease, Weismuller said, county health workers last spring tested 225 of her 
La Quinta classmates, followed in the fall by a screening of the entire student 
body.  
</P>
<P>
 In all, 16 cases of active TB were discovered at La Quinta, 12 of which were 
linked to the girl. An additional 178 students were found to be infected with 
the bacteria that causes TB. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth believes that the outbreak was the largest one in an American high 
school this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Weismuller said the La Quinta case illustrates shortcomings of the private 
medical community and the county in monitoring tubercular patients. 
</P>
<P>
 She said a review of medical records shows that the student believed 
responsible for the TB outbreak at La Quinta was infectious since January, 
1991, when she went to a private doctor complaining of a cough. 
</P>
<P>
 The private physician, Weismuller said, misdiagnosed her ailment as 
bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
 The student, who wasn't getting well, went to another physician who, as early 
as January, 1991, suspected that she had tuberculosis but did not report that 
to the county until June when he received laboratory reports that confirmed his 
diagnosis.  
</P>
<P>
 "He should have reported even a suspicion of tuberculosis to us," Weismuller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth and Weismuller said they have taken steps to make certain the 
mistakes at La Quinta will not be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably could have policed the private physicians more," Stallworth said. 
Because tuberculosis had almost disappeared in the United States, and has been 
increasing only since the mid-1980s, he said, many physicians need help in 
diagnosing and treating it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What public health is being asked to do is monitor what private physicians 
are doing," Stallworth said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the problems associated with the outbreak, he said, the county 
has hired a public health nurse to work with doctors who report TB cases to the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth said the physicians will be asked to show the county the kind of 
treatment they are prescribing and will be advised if any change should be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the treatment for tuberculosis can take as long as 12 months, 
Weismuller said, it it especially important to keep tabs on patient compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very difficult for any patient to comply with a long-term course of 
therapy," she said, "and the resources available in a private physician's 
office to keep track, for instance, of broken appointments with doctors, is 
limited. So we have to work together." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Stallworth said, he has added a new position of tuberculosis 
program manager and an epidemiologist to oversee the search for people who have 
had contact with confirmed TB patients and must be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they also plan to hand-deliver letters to all local 
laboratories, asking them to report initial positive TB tests, without waiting 
for final results. Weismuller said the county will be assisted by changes in a 
state law, which became effective in January, that requires the county health 
agency's approval of the treatment plan for every TB patient.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it came out of increased concern for the rising number of TB cases 
nationwide," she said.

MAHONY SUPPORTS 'DISSENTERS'; CARDINAL OPENS CHURCH CONCLAVE IN ANAHEIM; BACKS 
NUN, ORGANIZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger M. Mahony opened one of the largest religious conferences in 
the world Friday by declaring his uncompromising support for two church 
officials now under attack by conservative Catholics as "dissenters in sheep's 
clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony's backing of a leading nun in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles and a conference organizer of the annual religious event was greeted 
with a rousing ovation from an estimated 10,000 delegates during the morning's 
welcoming services at the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the three-day educational congress, more than 20,000 delegates from as far 
away as Poland and the Philippines are expected to participate in 240 
educational workshops offering a range of topics from "Understanding HIV 
Infection and AIDS" to "Getting to Know Jesus Better." 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening remarks, Mahony rose to defend Sister Edith Prendergast and 
conference coordinator Adrian Whitaker. Earlier this month, a small coalition 
of conservative Catholic groups demanded their resignations for inviting 
conference speakers who are critical of the Catholic Church and who have 
supported abortion rights as well as the ordination of women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give my categorical and uncompromising support" to the organizers, Mahony 
told the audience. "The overall good of this congress through the years is 
without question." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a dozen picketers distributed leaflets warning that the gathering 
could damage one's "spiritual health," Mahony told delegates to "smother" the 
protesters with love. The annual conference, he said, is "one of the finest 
expressions of the church." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the cardinal supported Prendergast and Whitaker, Mahony two weeks ago 
withdrew a conference invitation to Daniel Maguire, a former priest and 
abortion rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, for reasons not disclosed, the Rev. John R. Aurelio of Buffalo, N.Y., 
was taken off the list of speakers after allegations surfaced that he had 
molested two boys 15 to 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In wake of the news about Aurelio, Mahony said a system will be implemented to 
do thorough background checks of those invited to speak at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the controversy surrounding the conference organizers, delegate 
Steve Dzida, 43, who attends Sts. Simon and Jude Catholic Church in Huntington 
Beach, urged the archdiocese to continue inviting controversial and provocative 
speakers to the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are the kinds of people who are going to be able to lead us into 
the 21st Century," said Dzida, an attorney. "Putting the wraps around them is 
like trying to take us back to the Dark Ages, when we were holding Inquisitions 
and throwing Galileo in jail because he didn't accept the fact that everything 
revolved around the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Most delegates seemed unruffled by the protesters from two groups calling 
themselves Catholics United for the Splendor of Truth and the Huntington 
Beach-based JP2, after Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always someone out there promoting some cause," said Ted Shaw, a 
volunteer coordinator who has been to the last 20 religious conferences. 
"That's their right." 
</P>
<P>
 Though not familiar with the protesters outside, delegate Celeste Johnson, a 
15-year veteran of the event, said the conference should recruit more minority 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being an African American, I'd like to see a wider range of presenters," said 
Johnson, 33, a teacher at San Miguel Catholic School in the Watts section of 
Los Angeles. "This conference tends to be very white, so is the church. There's 
nothing wrong with that, we just need to broaden our appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Delegates spent most of Friday intently listening to a host of workshop 
speakers in search of new material to incorporate into their church teachings 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming to something like this is a chance to get in touch with what's 
happening in the church as a whole and not just what's going on in your own 
little corner," said Douglas Clipperton, 43, who teaches adult Catholic classes 
in Mojave. "It's a good shot in the arm." 
</P>
<P>
 For Leon Grygorczyk, a priest from Bialystok, Poland, the conference has 
already supplied him with ideas to take back to his church. "This is very 
different from Poland where in church, things are quiet," said Grygorczyk. 
"Everyone here is so involved, waving their hands, singing and dancing. It's 
very unusual to see this."

RADAR TOWER EMISSIONS CALLED SAFE AFTER TEST; OJAI VALLEY: THE DAYLONG STUDY 
FAILS TO EASE RESIDENTS' FEARS. THE RESULTS ARE CONSIDERED BELOW THE NATIONAL 
STANDARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Surrounded by detailed charts and maps, National Weather Service officials on 
Friday pointed to the results of a daylong study of energy emissions from a 
Sulphur Mountain radar tower which they say prove the weather-tracking system 
is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very confident that the microwave energy from the radar tower is way 
below the national standard," said Jim Campbell, deputy director of the 
National Weather Service's Western region. 
</P>
<P>
 Private researchers, hired by the National Weather Service, conducted six 
tests near the tower on Wednesday. Each one showed low levels of energy being 
emitted from the 98-foot radar tower, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were conducted specifically to ease local residents' fears of 
exposure to radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said the national standard for microwave emissions, set by the 
American National Standards Institute, is 1.8 milliwatts per centimeters 
squared. The highest average emission -- .0006 -- was recorded at a site on 
Sulphur Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's 10,000 times below the national standard," Campbell said, pointing to 
a graph behind him. Campbell said an emission of .0006 has the same effect as 
standing 10 feet from a microwave oven while it's on. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers tested emissions at five other sites: two others on Sulphur 
Mountain Road, one from the property where the tower stands, one from an upper 
Ojai elementary school and one from Santa Paula. Lower emissions were recorded 
at all five sites. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents said they weren't worried about an average emission. They wanted 
to know the amount of radiation emitted during peak periods. The radar's energy 
is emitted in pulses. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Martin, one of two researchers from the Illinois Institute of 
Technology Research Institute who conducted the tests, said at their highest 
point, the peaks of energy measured between .01 and .1 milliwatts per 
centimeters squared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overwhelmingly, the conclusions have been that this microwave energy emitted 
is safe for humans," Campbell said, citing airport radar towers as an example 
of a system that has shown no harmful effects. "This has been looked at for 
over 30 years, there's been something like 10,000 studies done . . . there 
would be some evidence that there is some increased risk and that hasn't been 
shown."  
</P>
<P>
 But Ojai Valley residents were not convinced by the recent test results or the 
government's claims. They stand firm in their desire to have the tower moved.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it makes a difference," Ojai Valley resident Lance Bergland 
said of the test results. "We don't believe in the standard." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Givner said the residents will continue to fight the tower's operation in 
the courtroom and in the legislature. The tower is operating at this time, 
while tests are being completed by the firm constructing 165 Doppler radar 
stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to fight this in court," Givner said. "If we had the money we'd 
do it immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 He said residents are trying to raise money to appeal a federal judge's 
decision earlier this month that allowed the government to turn on the radar 
tower. Givner estimates it could cost between $75,000 and $100,000 to appeal. 
</P>

EMERGENCY: EX-LAKER PLAYER A.C. GREEN HELPS FUND THE PROJECT. MEANWHILE, 
INSPECTORS FIND MORE DAMAGE TO BUILDINGS.; ' WITHOUT THE TENT, A LOT OF THESE

 Fillmore merchants devastated by the Jan. 17 earthquake will take a large step 
toward recovery Monday, when they resume business in a huge fabric tent near 
their damaged Central Avenue stores. 
</P>
<P>
 With financial assistance of an undisclosed amount from former Laker 
basketball player A.C. Green, the city of Fillmore has erected the 
11,000-square-foot tent in a downtown park to serve as a makeshift mini-mall 
for displaced businesses. Trailers have been installed nearby to house other 
merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be great," Dale Crockett, president of the Fillmore Chamber of 
Commerce, said Friday. Crockett's photography studio and the chamber's office 
are among the 11 Fillmore businesses that will reopen inside the tent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's been closed a month, with no cash and no cash flow," Crockett 
said. "Without the tent, a lot of these companies would have to fold." 
</P>
<P>
 While the temporary structures will help put Fillmore business owners back on 
their feet, thousands of quake victims in Fillmore and in Simi Valley are still 
staying with friends and family while waiting to repair their homes or find new 
housing, emergency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cities, inspectors continued to find more damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore inspectors have issued 329 red tags to buildings and trailers so 
heavily damaged that they are unsafe to occupy, and another 350 yellow tags to 
buildings considered risky to enter, city building official Jim Scheidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, inspectors have slapped yellow tags on 555 residences and 
businesses and 101 red tags on structures of all types. Inspectors have 
declared more than 7,500 damaged structures safe, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage in Simi Valley is estimated at more than $400 million, and many damaged 
buildings still have not been inspected, Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still a few people living in tents in the front yards of homes that 
they either cannot re-enter or (are) afraid to," Sedell said. "But by and 
large, people have put roofs over their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Just 54 people remain in an emergency shelter countywide, all at the Red Cross 
shelter at Fillmore Middle School, shelter manager John Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are slowing down, but we still have 13 families who haven't found 
housing, especially large families with eight to 10 members," Hernandez said. 
Red Cross volunteers have recruited bands and entertainers to boost sagging 
morale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten to the stage where they're very worried," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Palazuelos, a county mental health counselor, said the crowding and lack 
of privacy at the shelter have taken their toll on volunteers and earthquake 
victims alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's starting to wear on the volunteers," Palazuelos said. "Everybody's tired 
and has complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal disaster officials have spent $171 million in temporary housing 
assistance and housing repairs since the earthquake in Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties, said Russ Edmonston of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants, available without regard to financial need, help homeowners and 
renters pay for temporary housing until their residences are repaired or 
permanent housing is located. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, 147 lower-income Fillmore and Simi Valley residents have 
found permanent replacement housing in communities as far away as Ventura and 
Oxnard with federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Briggs, executive director of the Area Housing Authority of Ventura 
County, said volunteers from Fresno to San Diego have helped interview 
applicants for the aid program, which provides up to 18 months of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for every family that has found new quarters under the program, Briggs 
said, three other families with vouchers have not located new housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still holding out, doing a little house shopping, because they're 
temporarily staying with friends or relatives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to find something closer to home or want to wait until school lets 
out before moving," Briggs said. "Pretty soon they'll start looking farther 
afield."

PIRU'S DAMAGED BANK WILL NOT BE REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Piru's only bank, which has been closed since it was severely damaged in the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, will not reopen because repairs to the building are too 
costly, bank officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors of Citizen's State Bank of Santa Paula had considered 
operating from a mobile unit in Piru, but they decided against it for fear that 
such a site could be easily robbed, said bank President Joseph C. Nesbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a great relationship with the community and they have indicated that 
they need a bank, (but) the board felt that the liability may be more than they 
can handle," Nesbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, which had operated out of a 77-year-old brick building on Center 
Street since 1984, suffered extensive damage. Like many other buildings in the 
tiny rural town of nearly 1,200, the building was determined to be too 
dangerous to enter until the repairs were made. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be at least six months before the building could be repaired, Nesbitt 
said. He did not have an estimate on the cost of the repairs but said it would 
be prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the earthquake, Nesbitt said, bank officials had no intention of 
leaving the area. "We would have stayed there if it had not been for the 
earthquake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure marks the second time since the early 1980s that Piru has been 
left without a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, residents said they were disappointed and angry that now they have 
to drive either to Fillmore or Santa Paula for bank transactions, including 
withdrawing cash. 
</P>
<P>
 As it struggles to recover from the quake, Piru needs its own bank more than 
ever, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the responsibility of the bank to come out now and help us," said Patti 
Alexakis, 46, of Piru. "On top of the earthquake disaster, this is just one 
more disaster. It gives me the feeling that they (the bank) just don't care 
about us." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexakis said she plans to write a letter to the bank's board of directors 
complaining about the decision, and plans to organize a petition drive among 
residents asking the bank to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bank's board has approved the closure of the Piru branch, it 
still needs to submit a request that must be approved by the state and federal 
authorities, Nesbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Creason, president of the Fillmore-Piru Citrus Assn., said the bank 
closing would cause enormous detriment to the community. "We are just on the 
edge of redeveloping the town and the bank is a key holder of that 
development," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the association and several Piru residents were planning to build 
about 150 new houses with the bank's financial backing, but those plans must 
now be put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Creason said when the Bank of America left Piru about 15 years ago, he and 
other members of the association promised to do most of their business with 
Citizen's State Bank if the bank opened a branch in Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, Creason said, the association and the bank agreed that 
the bank would operate in a mobile unit to be located at the association's 
packing facility in Piru while the bank's building was being repaired, Creason 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Creason said he was surprised to learn about the bank board's decision and 
that he and other members of the association intend to address the bank's board 
before they submitted a closure petition to state and federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Sanchez, who owns two businesses in Piru -- Jim 's Video and Sanchez 
Grocery and Liquor -- said that since the earthquake when the bank closed, he 
has had to make two trips to Fillmore for banking transactions.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people depend on me to cash checks," Sanchez said referring to 
citrus workers who do not have a bank account. Since the quake, he said, many 
people have gone weeks without cashing their paychecks because he has 
discontinued the cashing service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be on the road from Fillmore to Piru with a lot of cash," 
Sanchez said. "That is dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Polly Bee, a Ventura County employee who has been helping residents in 
Fillmore rebuild their lives since the quake, said the lack of a bank in Piru 
will affect mostly the city's large elderly community, many of whom do not 
drive.  
</P>
<P>
 "The community has been knocked down with the earthquake and now they are 
getting a punch on the stomach," Bee said. "The community looks up to them (the 
bank) for support." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Bourne, manager of Citizen's State Bank's Fillmore branch, said many 
customers from Piru have been doing business in the Fillmore branch, which was 
barely affected by the earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 But driving eight miles to Fillmore just to cash a check is inconvenient to 
many residents, said Al Gaitan, president of the Piru Neighborhood Council. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, losing their bank is probably the most demoralizing 
event for Piru's residents, said Alexakis. "Not having a bank to call your own 
is discouraging."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; COALITION FORMED TO ATTRACT L.A. BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Insisting that they only want to be good neighbors, Ventura County business 
and government leaders have set up a coalition to attract quake-ravaged San 
Fernando Valley businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Wednesday, the newly formed Partners in Action coalition will offer a 
toll-free telephone line, a fast-track permit process and other relocation 
assistance to Los Angeles County businesses considering a temporary or 
permanent move to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to send the message that we want to keep you in Southern California 
and we want to be good neighbors," coalition spokeswoman Dana Weber Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley business boosters, however, did not take the offer so genially. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these are my neighbors, God forbid what my enemies might do," said Ben 
Reznik, chairman of the Earthquake Recovery Task Force for the Valley Industry 
and Commerce Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're thinking very selfishly," said Reznik, a Sherman Oaks lawyer. "If 
they were thinking about the region, they wouldn't be doing this."  
</P>
<P>
 Some Valley business owners said by attempting to attract businesses -- even 
temporarily -- to Ventura County, the coalition puts the entire Valley economy 
at risk.  
</P>
<P>
 "When businesses move out, it also affects the restaurants employees eat in 
and the stores they shop in," said Joe Kletzel, president of Chatsworth-based 
Devon Industries and a member of VICA. "It will destroy the economic base of 
the Valley."  
</P>
<P>
 Young disputed such talk, saying she doubts desirable commercial rental space 
can be found in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not aimed at stealing businesses," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition plans to spend about $30,000 on promotion and assistance, 
running ads in San Fernando Valley newspapers and on Valley radio stations and 
staffing the toll-free telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members promise that one phone call will be all a business needs to 
get industrial, commercial and residential rental information as well as advice 
on what local city best fits the company's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition includes local chambers of commerce, county government, real 
estate firms, and individual businessmen and businesswomen. Young said although 
only a few cities have so far agreed to join the coalition and donate money 
toward its marketing effort, many others have expressed interest in 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Ventura and Oxnard have each donated $2,500. The Thousand Oaks 
City Council will discuss donating $2,500 to the effort at its council meeting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hayes, economic redevelopment manager for the city of Moorpark, said 
Moorpark is ready to help ease a company's relocation from the Valley. The 
Moorpark City Council has not yet discussed participating in the coalition, he 
said 
</P>
<P>
 "Any Valley business that comes through will receive immediate, special 
attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition's telephone number, which will be in effect Wednesday and 
operating out of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn.'s office in 
Oxnard, is 1-800-880-3700 or 805-988-1106.

200 SUPPORT GALLEGLY ON HEALTH RULES; POLITICS: CONGRESSMAN CO-AUTHORED A BILL 
TO PREVENT THE FDA FROM ISSUING NEW REGULATIONS ON DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health activists and local residents packed a hearing conducted by Rep. Elton 
Gallegly in Ventura on Friday to oppose new regulations on dietary supplements 
and vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Republican is the co-author of pending legislation to head off 
the new rules, which are scheduled to go into effect in July. Opponents of the 
regulations say they would restrict the availability of supplements and in some 
cases eliminate them from the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Food and Drug Administration, which developed the rules, contends 
that they will only ensure that the labeling on supplements is truthful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rhetoric that the FDA plans on banning any supplements or requiring 
prescriptions for vitamins just isn't true," said Mitchell Zeller, an FDA 
spokesman who attended the hearing. "This is a truth-in-labeling issue. We want 
to protect the consumer from unsubstantiated claims." 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA has said that health claims for vitamins, minerals, herbs and other 
supplements will be subjected to the same requirements that currently apply to 
most foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agency's proposal, any claim touting the health benefits of a 
vitamin or supplement must be substantiated by "significant scientific 
agreement among qualified experts." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, held in the Reagan Room at the Ventura Holiday Inn, Zeller was 
almost alone in supporting the rules. Members of the 200-strong audience often 
broke in with objections to his assertions that the regulations would not hurt 
the $4-billion health-supplement industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me decide what goes in my body," a man in the audience yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can see, this is an emotional issue," Gallegly said during the 
intermission. "This really has to do with government regulation and the 
government saying they know better." 
</P>
<P>
 Other panelists gathered by Gallegly and a panel of doctors who practice 
alternative medicine in Southern California wowed the crowd with their claims 
of the benefits of nutritional supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Joan Priestly said the 700 AIDS patients she is treating with supplements 
are healthier than those treated with conventional drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard these kind of claims before," said John Gleason, a senior staff 
attorney for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Gleason was the 
only person to speak in support of the FDA rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those claims lure people into treatment or into purchasing supplements, and 
they're not substantiated," Gleason said. "The new rules are to ensure that 
people get accurate information."  
</P>
<P>
 Priestly said she could substantiate her claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-supplement supporters contend that information from studies such as 
Priestly's would be suppressed by the FDA. Gleason conceded that the 
regulations would prevent health stores from giving out information on vitamins 
and minerals that contains unsubstantiated health claims, even if the 
information was clipped from articles and independent reports. 
</P>
<P>
 This was particularly objectionable to supporters of the 
nutritional-supplement industry who spoke Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a moral obligation to disseminate information that will help my fellow 
citizens," said Dr. Julian Whitaker, president of the American Preventive 
Medical Assn., which is working against regulations on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not abide by the FDA's regime of censorship," Whitaker added. He then 
reached for a canister of vitamins labeled with the claims that Vitamin B 
prevents spina bifida and that Vitamin C may reduce the risk of heart disease 
and some forms of cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 Holding it aloft along with an inch-thick binder of articles on the benefits 
of supplements, Whitaker said: "Does anyone want to buy these truthfully 
labeled nutritional supplements?" 
</P>
<P>
 He sold three canisters amid a din of applause before Gallegly brought the 
hearing back to order.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; RED CROSS SALUTES ITS MAJOR DONORS

<P>
 Orange County Red Cross officials rolled out the red carpet Thursday night for 
companies and individuals who assisted in local disaster relief, including 
donations for last fall's Laguna Beach firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross collected nearly $700,000 to help fire victims and more than 
$500,000 worth of goods including shovels, gloves, food, clothes, sheets, even 
800 cameras for documenting fire damage, Red Cross spokeswoman Judy Iannaccone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the fire our back parking lot here was like Grand Central Station. We 
had one semi-tractor trailer showing up after another," she said. "We're very, 
very fortunate and glad that these corporations have come forward . . . but we 
need this support on an annual basis." 
</P>
<P>
 During an awards ceremony at the Red Cross office in Santa Ana, Red Cross 
officials honored representatives of 160 corporations and 135 individuals. 
Donors included the L.A. Kings, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, FHP Healthcare, 
Kaiser Permanente and Auto Trader magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Those being honored received plaques and chatted with volunteers. In addition 
to the fire relief money, the Irvine Co. and nine other corporations donated 
money to help the Red Cross meet a matching grant of $400,000 from an anonymous 
donor for general operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster preparedness is still on the minds of many Laguna Beach residents. 
Jill Brandenburger, Red Cross Laguna Beach outreach coordinator, said she 
handed out hundreds of disaster guideline pamphlets this week as rain pelted 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandenburger will offer a free introduction to disaster services March 16 
from 7 to 10 p.m. on the third floor of the Wells Fargo Bank Building, 260 
Ocean Ave. To register, call (714) 835-5381, Ext. 140.MARY LOU PICKEL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; TV NEWS SHOW CAN STAY IN CLASSROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children at Isbell Middle School in Santa Paula will continue to watch a 
commercial television news program in the classroom after the district's 
governing board backed away from a proposal to end the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Elementary School District's board of trustees decided not to 
terminate its contract with the company that offers the program called Channel 
One despite objections to advertising that was broadcast with the 15-minute 
news programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at the cash-strapped school said the benefits of the programming far 
outweigh the two minutes per day of flashy advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the agreement with Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle Communications, 
the company provides classrooms with $60,000 worth of equipment, including 
television sets for each classroom, a satellite dish and two video cassette 
recorders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine going back," said Mary Stillman, who teaches eighth grade at 
the school. "It would be crazy to give up all that equipment. I'm remembering 
how I had to carry my TV and VCR from home whenever I wanted to show an 
educational tape." 
</P>
<P>
 The board signed an agreement with Whittle Communications almost three years 
ago and at the time was one of just a handful of schools in California 
subscribing to the service. Nearly 100 public schools in California now 
broadcast Channel One in the classroom, and about 12,000 schools nationwide 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittle reportedly receives about $156,000 for each 30-second commercial, and 
was projected to gross approximately $90 million from the service last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Teachers Assn. has been a strong opponent of allowing 
commercial television into public schools, but no teachers spoke against it at 
the board meeting Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 School board trustee Gene Marzec who pushed to end the contract, echoed 
concerns of the association at the meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 "We already know kids watch too much TV," he said. "We know the parents are 
probably telling them to turn it off and go do their homework, and then they 
come into school and the first thing they do is sit down and watch TV." SCOTT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY PUTS $2.1 MILLION BACK IN ITS COFFERS 
</P>

<P>
 City finance officials have put back into the budget about $2.1 million in 
property tax revenue they feared would be lost to state budget cutbacks last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra money means that city revenue exceeded spending by $2.5 million this 
year.The city general fund reserves are at $15.9 million, a figure that had 
council members smiling this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to a consultant's report released last November that warned of an 
impending fiscal crisis within the next seven years, Councilman Robert D. 
Breton said: "We were told that the city was headed toward being awash in red 
ink . . . but this shows that we are not in a fiscal crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 The report indicated that the city wouldn't be able to balance its budget 
within two years and would deplete its reserves by 1999 if the current rate of 
spending went unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 It pointed to city projects such as its chain of recreation centers, which 
cost about $1 million annually, as a large drain on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the report's conclusions are changed because of the $2.1 million added 
to the budget this year, said city finance chief Irwin Bornstein. According to 
the report, the city by 1999 will have overspent its reserves by at least $2.5 
million, Bornstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will still be a deficit in the reserves" even after adding the $2.1 
million in property tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members have criticized the report as being short-sighted. Income 
from projects under development, such as a 290,000-square-foot mall, weren't 
included in the report, Mayor Susan Withrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also didn't take into account the eventual expansion of the (Mission 
Viejo) Mall," Withrow said. "My opinion is that (the report) was out of balance 
from the outset."FRANK MESSINA

 The Mighty Ducks' one-day tickets-for-guns exchange will be held today from 10 
a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Anaheim Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange specifically targets handguns, but "if someone comes in with a 
bazooka, we'll probably figure something out," said Bill Robertson, spokesman 
for the hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone turning in a firearm will receive two tickets to one of the Ducks' 
remaining home games this season. Depending on how many people take the team up 
on the offer, though, some pairs of seats may not be together. Many of the 
Ducks' remaining games are almost sold out, with only single seats available, 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope it's a big success, but there's no way to gauge it at this point," he 
said. "But our feeling is any handguns that are brought in mean that many more 
off the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange will be held just outside the entrance to the department, at 425 
S. Harbor Blvd.REBECCA TROUNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; FAIR WILL BID GOODBY TO BUFFALO RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're calling this weekend's public celebration at the Buffalo Ranch "the 
last roundup." 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists say the name aptly describes the precarious state of the 
landmark ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The last of the business tenants that rented space on the ranch left this 
month. And the Irvine Co., which owns the site, is talking with the Orange 
County Fair about moving all or some of the ranch's more than a dozen buildings 
to the Costa Mesa fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch has a colorful past that includes being home to an amusement park in 
the 1950s and the headquarters for the architects who designed parts of Irvine 
in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this backdrop, one of the Buffalo Ranch's oldest tenants, Lange 
Financial Corp., plans a family celebration at the site today and Sunday. The 
event will include food, music, hot-air balloon rides, pony rides, a petting 
zoo and other activities. On Sunday, some bison that have grazed on the ranch 
since the mid-1980s will be auctioned off. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Lange said sponsoring the event is a way to bid farewell to a 
property beloved not just by company employees but by residents in the 
surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to say goodby," said Shelia Starnes of Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. said the best way to preserve the ranch buildings is to move 
them to a place where they can be used productively. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Fair proposed using the buildings as classrooms and meeting halls 
at the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said one of the reasons the Irvine Co. decided to clear out all 
tenants from the ranch is that the coming realignment of Ford Road will reduce 
vehicle access to the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The company hopes to eventually build homes on the ranch, situated at the 
corner of Ford Road and MacArthur Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists working to have the spot listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places said they would prefer to have the structures remain intact at 
their current spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last roundup" takes place today and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Admission is $10 for adults and $5 for children.SHELBY GRAD

 The first of two seminars that will focus on ways to prepare Laguna Beach for 
the possibility of flooding will be held today in the City Council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminars are a joint effort of the Laguna Beach Fire Department and the 
governor's office of emergency services, which are preparing a flood 
preparedness program for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will be presented at 2 p.m. today at Laguna Beach City Hall, 505

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; REFRIGERATED WAREHOUSE AT DOCK 
DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the din and clatter of a bustling Port of Hueneme as a backdrop, state 
and local business and political leaders formally dedicated the port's massive 
refrigerated warehouse Friday, with toasts of the Scandinavian aperitif aquavit 
and California wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Built by the port and Cool Carriers -- the giant Scandinavian shipping line -- 
the 140,559-square-foot warehouse was designed to refrigerate citrus from the 
Sunkist Growers Assn. that is awaiting export overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 The warehouse, cooled with a cold-brine refrigeration system with the power of 
100,000 kitchen refrigerators, covers an area the size of three football 
fields. Officials with Cool Carriers say it is the largest refrigerated 
warehouse on any dock in North or South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at the port aboard historic rail cars from the Fillmore Short Line 
were dignitaries that included Cool Carriers President Bo Natt och Dag, Rep. 
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), California Secretary of Agriculture Henry Voss 
and Sunkist Growers President Russ Hanlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony J. Taormina, executive director of the Oxnard Harbor District that 
operates the port, said the warehouse would help increase agricultural business 
at "the port that farmers built." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly summed up the benefits of the new facility with three words: "Jobs, 
jobs, jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside part of the warehouse that had been converted into a banquet hall for 
the dedication, guests spoke about the economic advantages of the $10-million 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Leavens, whose family grows more than 900 acres of lemons, oranges and 
grapefruit, called the refrigerated facility "a real leg up for us." 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a great asset to growers," Leavens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of the facility should also help the Port of Hueneme gain 
visibility among area exporters, said Viola M. Koch of VK International 
Consultants of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may make a difference," Koch said. "It will give people an idea to 
export who have never exported before." PATRICK McCARTNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ILLEGALLY PREPARED FOOD TARGET OF PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county soon will crack down on illegally prepared food sold door-to-door, 
from the back of cars and in ethnic markets and other locations, a public 
health official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Merryman, director of the environmental health division of the 
county Health Care Agency, said his office has noticed an increase in illegally 
prepared and packaged foods in the past four years and is sending out a final 
warning before going after violators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting ready to crack down, but before we do this, we want to reach 
out to the general public," Merryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few weeks, his office has distributed flyers in Spanish, Chinese, 
Vietnamese, Korean and English to various ethnic markets in the county warning 
consumers and grocers to be suspicious of foods that do not appear to be 
properly packaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Merryman said his office has received several complaints about door-to-door 
food vendors and food businesses operating out of private homes. But he has 
received no complaints of illness. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental health division has routinely found full-scale manufacturing 
operations in garages, back yards and homes, Merryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that food sold to the public be prepared and stored in a 
licensed and inspected facility. Those who prepare food in their homes are 
guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and or six months 
in jail.MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; ARTWORK HONORS LEE, GOLD MEDALIST DIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As artist Robert B. Krantz on Friday unveiled a three-foot-tall bronze artwork 
honoring Dr. Sammy Lee, the first Korean American to win a gold medal in the 
Olympics, Krantz offered an anecdote from Lee's coaching days. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as a great but insistent diving teacher, Lee trained two-time Olympic 
gold-medal winners Bob Webster and Greg Louganis. He won a gold medal and a 
bronze medal in the 1948 Olympics in London and a gold in the 1952 Helsinki 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
 But Krantz' story at a Rotary Club luncheon at the Hotel Laguna had to do with 
a young diver. 
</P>
<P>
 "The diver was not getting off the board as high as Lee wanted her to," Krantz 
said. "And, Lee had this stick, a long pointer. No whip. He held it up, about 
three feet above his head, saying to her, 'I want you to get that high off the 
board.' She looked at him and said, 'I can't go up that high.' But Lee was 
insistent. He looked at her and firmly said, 'I didn't ask for your opinion.' 
Well, the diver cleared the mark." 
</P>
<P>
 As Lee was introduced to the Rotarians, the diminutive, five-foot-tall coach 
told them: "Krantz didn't tell you I stood on a box when I held that stick up." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's self-deprecating style of humor always seems to catch audiences off 
guard. It belies a man whose accomplishments include becoming a U.S. Army 
major, a physician, Olympic diver, and diving for the U.S. Olympic diving team. 
Now retired as an ear surgeon and living in Huntington Harbour, the 73-year-old 
dynamo has not lost anything growing older. 
</P>
<P>
 He still, on occasion, helps train a group of high school-level and younger 
divers at the Mission Viejo Recreation Center's Olympic diving complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee doesn't sway from debate on the center's future which is in question due 
to funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame if we lose that training facility because it has produced more 
gold medal Olympic winners in swimming and diving than anywhere else in the 
United States," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Krantz said it was this energy, Lee's motivation for trying to get the maximum 
from everyone he trained, condensed and put in visual form in the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 The artwork, commissioned by the Laguna Beach-based Kalos Kagathos Foundation, 
is a three-piece representational bronze that has a world globe at its base, 
with two hands emanating and supporting two statuesque divers of both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Hopping, Kalos foundation chairman, said the artwork will be known as 
the Sammy Lee Award, which is selected by the World Diving Coaches Assn., every 
four years as the most prestigious award in competitive diving. 
</P>
<P>
 The artwork will be displayed at the International Swimming Hall of Fame 
Museum at Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Hopping said.DAVID REYES

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; YOUTH PLEADS GUILTY IN RACIAL INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old Ventura gang member whom prosecutors describe as a white 
supremacist pleaded guilty Friday to making racial threats against a black 
Ventura High School security guard during a Jan. 26 basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Cecil Lassiter will be sentenced March 21 in Ventura County Superior 
Court on one count of threatening a school employee.Prosecutors dismissed a 
charge against him of disturbing the peace at a school. 
</P>
<P>
 Lassiter had been held in the Ventura County Jail in lieu of a $5,000 bail 
since the basketball game incident, in which he threatened to get a gun and 
shoot a school security guard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard was trying to escort Lassiter and some of his friends away from the 
gymnasium, where the suspects had surrounded two 16-year-old black students and 
yelled racial epithets at them, Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary K. Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett said the district attorney's office will recommend probation for 
Lassiter. "The conduct, just by itself, isn't worth a trip to prison in our 
view," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lassiter told the judge that he is unemployed and a member of a gang that 
frequents the Ventura Avenue area, but denied being a white supremacist. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Bruce A. Clark also agreed to allow Lassiter to be released on his own 
recognizance on the condition that he not come within 100 feet of Ventura High 
School and not associate with fellow gang members. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MOM GETS PROBATION IN CHILD-STEALING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura mother of two who fled to Paris rather than give up her children was 
granted probation Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A probation report and a prosecutor had recommended a one-year jail term for 
32-year-old Nikki Lynn Ruberoe. 
</P>
<P>
 But Superior Court Judge James McNally cited Ruberoe's lack of criminal 
history and the fact that the defendant returned the children safely to their 
father, who is the custodial parent. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge suspended a six-month prison term. Ruberoe had pleaded guilty to 
child stealing, violating a custody agreement, conspiracy and helping her 
fugitive husband flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
 She was granted temporary custody of her two children last summer. But when 
her current husband was convicted of multiple counts of child molestation, she 
took the children out of the country rather than return them to their 
biological father. 
</P>
<P>
 She later admitted to taking the children, ages 10 and 13, to France and then 
arranging for their return after authorities began looking for them. She was 
arrested last September in Sri Lanka, where she had gone to meet her fugitive 
husband, 28-year-old Channa Ruberoe, a Sri Lankan national. Ventura County 
authorities are trying to extradite the husband to sentence him on child 
molestation charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think on some level, the defendant loves her children, but she puts herself 
first," Deputy Dist. Atty. Mandee Sanderson told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nikki Ruberoe's attorney, Steve Pell, said his client was negatively 
influenced by her husband, whom Pell termed "a bum, a flim-flam artist." DWAYNE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; CITY CLERK COMPLETES CERTIFICATION COURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Clerk Elaine M. Capps gets to use the letters CMC behind her name. 
</P>
<P>
 She said being awarded the prestigious designation Certified Municipal Clerk 
brings more credibility and respect among professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The award also gives the city a boost of prestige at a time when it is needed, 
city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 As City Council and staff members have been dealing with controversy over 
redevelopment projects and lawsuits regarding eminent domain over the past 
three years, Capps has been taking classes on improving her job performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Her new title makes her one of only 203 city clerks in California who are 
certified, said Sheri Burdick, spokeswoman for the International Institute of 
Municipal Clerks, the association which awards the designation. There are more 
than 800 city clerks in the state, Burdick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capps, a resident of Brea since 1964, was elected in 1992. She served as the 
city's deputy city clerk for two years before her election. She was hired by 
the city in 1975 as previously worked as a clerk in the community services, 
finance, development and research departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Capps is responsible for preparing City Council agendas and answering public 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 She handles about 100 phone calls a day from people who seek information about 
the city, including questions about legislators, the city codes, the location 
of the dump and the deadline to file papers to run for election for the 
council, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like it a lot," said Capps, a grandmother of eight. "I have a lot of 
public contact because this is a very special city. People are really 
interested in what's happening here." 
</P>
<P>
 Burdick said the certification program began in 1970 in an effort to 
"professionalize the city clerk position." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; ROCK 'JAM' TO AID ORANGEWOOD HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rock 'n' roll bands will be making music Sunday to benefit abused and 
neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Kids Benefit Jam" will be held from 2 p.m. until midnight at Music City, 
18774 Brookhurst St. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the event will benefit Orangewood Children's Home, a 
county-operated facility that provides emergency care and shelter, said Brad 
Morisette, event coordinator for the Fun Book, a recreation and entertainment 
directory that is co-sponsoring the daylong concert with Music City. 
</P>
<P>
 Morisette said the Fun Book will be coordinating a series of events this year 
to raise money for the children at the county facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to create some fun and entertainment for them so it takes the trauma 
and drama out of their lives, because they're not getting a fair shake," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morisette said the bands and entertainers are performing free. Raffles and 
auctions will also be held, and there will be a free buffet from 2 to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $10 before the event and $13 at the door. Morisette said tickets 
are $8 at the door with a toy or item appropriate for a child or teen-ager.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; SINGER-DANCER DOING TIME AS UNDERSTUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What would an 18-year-old runner-up in the Miss La Palma Pageant do in 
mid-town Manhattan for the first time? 
</P>
<P>
 If you are Roxanne Taga, you land a role in the Broadway production of "Miss 
Saigon," move into a studio apartment near Times Square and delay your entrance 
into college by a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer and dancer has spent the past six months living alone and 
performing nightly shows on the Broadway stage. 
</P>
<P>
 She plays a non-speaking part as a prostitute for now, but is also the 
understudy to the title role of Kim, a Vietnamese woman who becomes "Miss 
Saigon" and falls in love with a U.S. soldier during wartime. 
</P>
<P>
 Taga hopes to follow in the footsteps of two other actresses of Filipino 
descent -- Tony award-winning Lea Salonga and Leila Florentino -- who have 
portrayed the role of Kim to critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Taga was given an official city proclamation from the mayor and 
City Council of La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 Taga took to the stage for the first time after only one audition and one 
intense week of rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very nervous knowing that I was on Broadway," she said Friday while on 
a one-week vacation to visit her parents and two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The nervousness and novelty has worn off, and performing on Broadway is like 
any other job, she said: "I do my best every night, even when I am sick. I am 
not a rich superstar." 
</P>
<P>
 Her good fortune is no fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been dancing and singing since she was 4, and has compiled a long list 
of accolades: student body president, homecoming queen, Kennedy High's best 
singer three years straight, a finalist on television's "Star Search Junior," 
and an appearance on "Punky Brewster," not to mention a host of roles in Orange 
County stage performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been involved in dancing my whole life. I have always been in the 
spotlight," she said. "If my parents didn't push me, I would not be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Ernest Taga, 53, went to New York with her last summer to help her 
find a place to live after she signed a contract to join the ensemble cast of 
"Miss Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
 He was shocked to see his daughter appear on stage scantily clad. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would only say that the show was good," she said, adding that he declined 
to critique his daughter's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that, Roxanne's father and mother, Roxanna, are proud of their 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went out there with her to New York for a month. I observed her very 
closely, and she never showed any signs of being lonely," Ernest Taga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxanne Taga is planning to visit with friends this weekend before flying back 
to New York on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very lucky to be in the situation I am now," she said. BOB ELSTON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; FINAL TOUCHES FOR 6.5-MILE BICYCLE 
TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Work crews are expected to paint the last few stripes on fresh blacktop along 
the Arroyo Simi next week, opening a 6.5-mile bike trail that stretches from 
one end of the city almost to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District has been working since summer to 
pave and improve nearly two miles of trail along the drainage canal at the base 
of Sequoia Street and Tapo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews finished installing fences, gates and sign posts along the two-mile 
segment this week, said Jerry Gladden, parks district director. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the path is open, bicyclists will be able to ride all the way from Madera 
Road on the trail's western end to the Metrolink station on Los Angeles Avenue 
at the eastern end. 
</P>
<P>
 That is good news to some cyclists who had to rattle and clatter over rough 
dirt and gravel on the unfinished portions in the middle part of the trail 
before they were done, said Al Bandel, a spokesman for the Rocky Peak Mountain 
Bike Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had a mountain bike, it was not a problem" Bandel said Friday. "But 
10-speeds were not made for that. . . . Each section they open is very 
helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks officials said plans are being drawn for improving the final 2,200-foot 
segment of the trail that extends west from Madera Road west toward Moorpark.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; TRIBE POSTPONES RECOMMENDATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Native American tribal leaders said Thursday that they won't make 
recommendations for the disposition of what they believe to be remains of 
ancestors buried in the Bolsa Chica Wetlands until an investigation into an 
alleged death threat to an archeologist is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal leaders said this week that they are not involved in the recent threat 
reported by archeologist Nancy Whitney-Desautels, who unearthed what some 
believe to be ancient Native American bones in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 One leader said that the FBI had contacted him and told him agents would be 
questioning Native Americans concerning the threat allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI Agent Gary Morley would not confirm or deny the existence of an 
investigation Friday, but he did say he was familiar with the threat report. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll Real Estate Group plans to build more than 4,000 homes in the area. The 
controversy about ancient remains in Bolsa Chica began last month, when 
opponents of the project leaked to the press an internal memo written by a 
forensic anthropologist hired by the Orange County coroner's office to examine 
bones found at the site in 1992. In the memo, the bones were described as "very 
old, approximately 8,000 years." Some of the bones were of human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Project opponents were angered that no mention of the 1992 find was made in 
the county's draft environmental impact report on the project, released late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Native American leaders met with representatives of the Native 
American Heritage Commission, a state body that oversees matters dealing with 
Native Americans. One representative of the developer also attended the meeting 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabrieleno Shoshone Chief Vera Rocha said Native Americans are being singled 
out in the death threat matter and that she won't participate in any 
recommendations process until their names are cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Velasques, another Gabrieleno Shoshone chief, said in an interview this 
week that an FBI agent had contacted him and told him that the agency is 
planning to investigate the death threat report and that Native Americans are 
on the list to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Dunn, senior vice president of the Koll Real Estate Group, said 
Thursday's decision by Native American leaders to delay burial recommendations 
will have no effect on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said she was told by consultant Darlene Shelley, who attended the 
meeting, that Native Americans said they trusted the company and 
Whitney-Desautels to take good care of the remains until reburial with 
appropriate religious ceremony.ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; RECALL EFFORT FACES PETITION DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers have three days left to gather signatures to force Mayor Charles V. 
Smith and three other City Council members to face a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be out there in the rain," Rebecca Danna, one of the leaders of the 
recall drive, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than three months of circulating the recall petitions, Danna said, 
"we feel we have enough (signatures). But we will work until the deadline just 
to make sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Recall proponents have until 5 p.m. Monday to gather 6,938 signatures to 
qualify for the ballot, according to City Clerk Mary Lou Morey. The original 
deadline, today, was changed because it falls on a Saturday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morey said she will count the signatures once the petitions are submitted to 
ensure the required number was gathered, then turn them over to the county 
Registrar of Voters, for verification that the names are of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a sufficient number of verified signatures, a recall election will 
be held in 88 to 125 days, Morey said. Should a majority of the council members 
be recalled, there would be a special election to replace them in the next 114 
to 129 days, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the cost of an extra election to remove Smith and council 
members Craig Schweisinger, Charmayne S. Bohman and Tony Lam would be about 
$150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort was prompted by last year's $1-million cut in the Fire 
Department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the firefighters union, who are supporting the recall, said the 
council put public safety in jeopardy. BERT ELJERA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITIZENS WILL JOIN HOUSING ISSUES 
PANEL

<P>
 Thousand Oaks' housing issues committee will expand its roster next month to 
include citizens as well as council members and planning commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the panel has invited residents to apply for five at-large 
seats.Applications, available in the city clerk's office, are due March 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaired by Mayor Elois Zeanah, the committee examines housing issues in 
Thousand Oaks, focusing on the best ways to provide low-cost housing and help 
first-time buyers. Other committee members are Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski and 
planning commissioners Merv Kopp and Linda Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants should have backgrounds in real estate, social services or urban 
planning as well as a general interest in neighborhoods and housing issues, 
Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had very little citizen input -- that's what seems to be missing in 
the equation," Zukowski said. "We need people who can keep a balanced 
perspective, (looking at) not just profitability of developments but also 
livability." 
</P>
<P>
 The term for the citizen members has not yet been decided, City Clerk Nancy 
Dillon said. STEPHANIE SIMON

 A 13-year-old Simi Valley boy charged with fatally stabbing one of his Valley 
View Junior High School classmates pleaded not guilty in Ventura County 
Superior Court on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Steven Z. Perren set an April 18 trial for Phillip Hernandez, who will 
not be tried as an adult because he is under 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip is charged with a single count of murder in the Feb. 1 death of 
14-year-old Chad Patrick Hubbard, a popular student and member of the school 
baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students have said the two boys had a running feud that escalated a week 
before the stabbing when Hernandez took Chad's baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen of Chad's relatives and friends appeared at Friday's 
arraignment. Phillip's mother, grandmother and an aunt were also present in 
court. Both families declined to comment afterward. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PLAN FOR 50-FOOT-TALL AMGEN LAB 
REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Planning Commission, seeking to uphold strict city limits on 
building height, rejected Amgen's request Friday to build a 50-foot-tall 
research facility in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The biotechnology firm had proposed building a 247,000-square-foot laboratory 
with underground parking at Hillcrest Drive and Rancho Conejo Boulevard as part 
of a planned decades-long expansion program. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hastily scheduled meeting that started Thursday evening and stretched 
past 1 a.m. Friday, the Planning Commission rejected the building because it 
exceeds the city's 35-foot height limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen officials argued that the extra height was necessary because the 
building contains elaborate laboratories that require space for special heating 
and cooling ducts and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see the (building's highest point) if you're on the Borchard Road 
overpass or on top of a hill in Lynn Ranch," said Ed Bjurstrom, the company's 
director of engineering and construction. "But it won't be obtrusive." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the height, commissioners expressed concern that the proposed 
research building would crowd nearby streets. Amgen had asked for waivers of 
the city's standard requirements that buildings be set back a certain distance 
from the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council made it clear that they want exceptions made for this community 
resource, which is providing jobs," Commissioner Marilyn Carpenter said. Yet 
she added that the height and setback waivers Amgen requested seemed too 
drastic. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came just days after the Planning Commission approved other 
aspects of Amgen's plan, including closing a section of Camino Dos Rios to 
create an insulated corporate campus. The City Council will review the entire 
expansion plan, including the street closure and the 50-foot research facility, 
on March 1. STEPHANIE SIMON

UCI PROPOSALS PROMPT STRONG REACTIONS; EDUCATION: PROFESSORS AND STAFF MEMBERS 
WHOSE PROGRAMS WOULD BE CUT PROTEST. THE LEADER OF ONE BUDGET PANEL SAYS HE HAS 
RECEIVED SUPPORTIVE CALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 UC Irvine professors who face elimination of their programs registered strong 
reactions Friday to the university's proposed budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Across campus, heads of departments with courses of study on the chopping 
block questioned whether the proposals would save much money and asserted that 
the budget cuts would come at the expense of students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the recommendations) show a great ignorance," said Juan Bruce-Novoa, 
who heads the Spanish department, which may be merged with two unrelated Latin 
studies programs. "I don't think the people who wrote this report really 
understand the fields they are talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dennis Aigner, dean of UCI's Graduate School of Management, said all 
departments must try to save money in the financial crisis and that he welcomed 
the challenge of making sure his school survives despite the economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, two university task forces issued a series of sweeping 
recommendations to help reduce the 1994-95 budget by an estimated $4 million. 
The dozens of proposals include eliminating UCI's teacher credentialing 
program, its comparative cultural and physical education programs and reducing 
the number of vice chancellors by half. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI has lost about $35 million in permanent state funding since 1990. Since 
then, university officials have made administrative cuts, used reserve funds, 
reduced salaries, increased student fees and offered early retirements to 
faculty and staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks ahead, five elected committees will evaluate the task force 
recommendations. These will ultimately be rejected or accepted by Chancellor 
Laurel Wilkening on or before April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 At the UCI department of education, Chairman Alan Hoffer said the programs 
selected for elimination were hit hard because they had no faculty 
representatives on the task forces. The committees recommend that Hoffer's 
teacher credentialing program be transferred to the California State University 
system, which is separate from the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took down some of the (departments) they could attack," Hoffer said, 
adding that the recommendations to cut academic departments were "ludicrous." 
The proposals will not result in saving that much money anyway, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Also recommended for closure is the physical education department, which has 
served an estimated 6,700 students over the last three quarters. P.E. classes 
are so popular that they are running at or near capacity, and there have been 
waiting lists with over 3,000 students on them, according to department 
Chairman Timothy Tift. 
</P>
<P>
 "The student population will be the losers of an opportunity to take part in 
the program," Tift said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many academics were quick to criticize the recommendations, earth 
system science professor Ralph Cicerone, leader of the task force that proposed 
academic cuts, said he received many positive calls of support on Friday from 
the faculty and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't usually hear from the negative ones," Cicerone said. "I'm not 
supposed to be advancing or defending these reports. We (did) the first step, 
and I think we did it well." 
</P>
<P>
 "We all take our share" of the cuts, said Aigner, of the Graduate Management 
School. "I saw it coming. We positioned ourselves well. I'm happy to get on 
with growing on our own without any increase in state money." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force recommended that the management school be privatized, although 
it would be allowed to retain its present enrollment, with any future expansion 
to be paid for through agreements with private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the academic proposals, the recommendations also call for some student 
services and administrative positions to be scaled back. One proposal would cut 
health services and require students to pay for their medical care out of 
pocket instead of through insurance from the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dorcas Eaves, director of Student Health Services, acknowledged that UCI 
needs to make some changes, but she called the proposal unfair for students and 
the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to cut the services for the students, but these are the 
services we pay for in our fees," said Rhedis Thomas, 19, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students Friday had not yet considered how the proposals might affect 
their academic lives, and others were "reactionless," as Aaron Mukhopadhyay put 
it. Said the 21-year-old student with a smirk: "They're always cutting funding! 
It's hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior David Kesselman, president of undergraduate student government at UCI, 
said students were not represented on either budget task force. There will be 
student representatives, however, on the committees that review the 
recommendations. Kesselman said the chancellor assured him that the their 
suggestions will be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cicerone on Friday questioned whether the task force proposals can solve 
the school's budget problems. "My fear is that with the budget so bad, even if 
we adopt all of these recommendations, we will still be in financial trouble," 
he said. "We're not expecting the University of California to be healed for a 
long time."

BRISTOL STREET EXPANSION FIGHT RENEWED AT COURT HEARING; REDEVELOPMENT: 
RESIDENTS WHO WOULD BE DISPLACED CHARGE THAT SANTA ANA HAS NOT FOUND THEM NEW 
HOUSING. 
</P>

<P>
 Opponents of Santa Ana's controversial Bristol Corridor Redevelopment Project 
faced off with city officials in Superior Court on Friday, arguing that the 
city has not complied with a state appellate court ruling that it find new 
housing for hundreds of families. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for a businessman and single mother in the proposed 783-acre project 
area who filed suit in 1990 also said the city has not adequately explained why 
non-blighted property next to a stretch of Bristol Street, which is slated for 
widening, is included in the project boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 4th District Court of Appeal agreed early last year that the general 
project area was blighted, it ordered city officials to resolve those two 
remaining issues before proceeding with the redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana City Atty. Edward J. Cooper countered Friday that the city has met 
its obligations, saying there is ample housing in Santa Ana for families who 
would be forced to move during the 35-year span of the plan. That housing 
includes homes for sale as well as rentals that accept federal subsidy 
vouchers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert A. Knox listened to both sides and took the matter 
under advisement. He said he expects to rule within a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the city's $355-million plan to expand Bristol Street from four 
lanes to six between Memory Lane and Central Avenue, and revamp more than a 
dozen commercial areas along the strip. The council approved the project in 
late 1989 after 2 1/2 years of planning, but the lawsuit has ensured that all 
tax money generated by property in the proposed zone be frozen in an escrow 
account. In addition, the city has only been able to acquire property from 
those volunteering to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they have nevertheless proceeded with plans for the 
street-widening. Since 1989, the city has spent about $5 million in federal 
grants to purchase roughly 30 properties along Bristol Street between McFadden 
and Edinger avenues, and to relocate the displaced residents and businesses, 
said Robert B. Hoffman, redevelopment and real estate manager for the Community 
Development Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But those residents and business owners who want to stay in the area have not 
been able to apply for rehabilitation loans, which would be available if the 
project had been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has been controversial from the start, and required a four-fifths 
council majority vote for approval after a committee of businesses and 
residents formed to review the plan overwhelmingly rejected it in 1988. 
Residents in the area also complained that they had never been informed of the 
project details in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 While most residents in the area -- parts of which have been plagued by 
drug-dealing -- agreed that the neighborhood should be improved, the fear of 
displacement quickly took center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Richard Spix, who represents Robert T. Gonzales, an optometrist with 
offices in the project area, and Evangelina Avalos, a single mother in the 
zone, said Friday that the city failed to identify exactly how many families 
would be displaced by the project. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the housing that city officials are pointing to as available is either 
too expensive for many of the Bristol project-area residents, or substandard. 
Spix visited and photographed at least six addresses listed by the city as 
potential replacement housing units that accept federal vouchers, and said he 
found them roach-infested, with deteriorated sewage systems and other 
structural problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Spix entered his photographs as evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throwing (them) out onto the less-than-tender mercies of the Santa Ana 
housing market really does these hundreds of families a disservice," he told 
the judge, asking him to abide by the appellate decision and bring an end to 
the project. "The city has totally failed to do what the Court of Appeal has 
requested." 
</P>
<P>
 Spix said he found it ironic that a city plagued by residential overcrowding 
would point to such an availability of housing. He also said the city should 
have explained in more detail why the properties off Bristol Street qualify as 
blighted. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials countered that a staff report prepared late last year 
adequately addresses all of those concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The area off Bristol Street should be included in the project area because 
overcrowding and high crime qualify the entire neighborhood as blighted, Cooper 
said. It was included in the project area in order "to keep boundaries 
uniform," not solely for the purpose of generating tax revenue for the 
redevelopment zone, which is against the law, city documents filed with the 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our staff has made a very good effort in answering the questions 
raised by the 4th District Court of Appeal," Cooper told Knox, adding that 
redevelopment law ensures no one will be left on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the Redevelopment Agency can move anybody out of a house, it has to 
have replacement housing for that family," he said. "That's what the law says." 
</P>
<P>
 Families would be moved out gradually, over the life-span of the redevelopment 
project, making it nearly impossible to identify who they will be, or find 
housing for them now, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the project has been held up by legal action possibly 
longer than any other redevelopment plan in the city's history. But they vowed 
to persevere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a grind, but I'm not frustrated. We just think it's part of the 
process," Hoffman said. "For every (redevelopment) project the city has 
adopted, there seems to be some kind of legal challenge. We'll keep working on 
it until the court says we've got it right."

3-YEAR UNDERCOVER OPERATION YIELDS 1,000 POUNDS OF COCAINE; CRIME: VENTURA 
COUNTY-BASED PROGRAM DISRUPTS COLOMBIAN CARTELS' U.S. BUSINESS. EIGHTEEN ARE 
ARRESTED AND $5.8 MILLION SEIZED. 
</P>

<P>
 Federal and local authorities in Ventura County have seized $5.8 million in 
cash and nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine as part of a three-year nationwide 
money-laundering and drug-trafficking case targeting major Colombian cartels. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover operation, which was based in Ventura County, led to the arrest 
of one high-ranking member of the Cali cartel and 17 other members of the Cali 
and Medellin cartels. No details of the arrests were given, nor were the 
suspects identified. 
</P>
<P>
 More arrests are expected as authorities seek a dozen federal indictments in 
the case next week. Five suspects have been secretly indicted in Los Angeles 
and Detroit, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference in Ventura on Friday, Ventura County Sheriff Larry 
Carpenter said the case represents the largest confiscation of drug money in 
county history and the second-largest seizure of drugs. The largest was a 1989 
Simi Valley case involving 2,100 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will become the benchmark," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to $2 million of the seized cash could be returned to the Sheriff's 
Department through federal asset-forfeiture laws, he said. The money was seized 
at a variety of locations in several states over two years, including $1 
million last month in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint investigation by U.S. Customs officials and Ventura County deputies 
was launched in October, 1991, when an informant arranged a meeting at a 
Thousand Oaks hotel between undercover sheriff's deputies and a high-level Cali 
trafficker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out with the cartel, so we knew we were going to be at a very 
significant level," Carpenter said.  
</P>
<P>
 Before long, undercover agents from Ventura County had infiltrated both 
Colombian cartels and met with traffickers in Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit, 
Chicago, New York and Newark, N.J., the sheriff said. Authorities consider the 
two cartels responsible for most of the cocaine imported into this country. 
</P>
<P>
 To gain greater access to the cartels, drug agents set up an illegitimate 
money-laundering organization based in eastern Ventura County that would, for a 
fee, deposit drug profits in U.S. and foreign banks. The sums averaged about 
$500,000 and ranged from $100,000 to several million, said James D. Donahue, 
resident agent in charge of the U.S. Customs office in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the investigation expanded into drug trafficking. On half a 
dozen occasions, agents were paid to transport cocaine, all of which was seized 
by other authorities before it reached the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, they came to us to not only launder the money, but to transport 
drugs," Donahue said. "We couldn't get into the narcotics early or we would 
have had to seize it. And that could have tipped them off." 
</P>
<P>
 The case was novel because it involved both money laundering and drug 
trafficking, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said the 960-pound cocaine seizure, worth about $44 million on the 
street, will not set the cartels back significantly. But he said the busts have 
disrupted drug operations within several subgroups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confusion has reigned supreme in the past month, as we had hoped," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By posing as money launderers, authorities identified 30 bank accounts in 
Miami, Atlanta, Los Angeles and overseas tied to the cartels' operations. About 
$300,000 has been seized in recent weeks from 21 accounts, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities decided to end the investigation last month, when they saw a 
chance to seize large amounts of both cocaine and cash. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 12, undercover agents were given 458 pounds of cocaine at an 
undisclosed location in Thousand Oaks to deliver to drug sellers. Two days 
later, authorities seized $1 million in cash in Thousand Oaks. Another $1.5 
million was then confiscated in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, authorities laid out piles of cocaine, packaged in 
white, black and tan wrapping, along with bundles of bills in denominations of 
$5, $10, $20, and $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators would not say whether the suspects are Ventura County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sgt. Gary Pentis, who heads the sheriff's unit that began the 
investigation, said, "There has been involvement by county residents from the 
onset of this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Some suspects remained unaware of the broader investigation even after they 
were arrested, because local police stopped them under the guise of traffic 
violations, then feigned surprise when discovering cash or cocaine in the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have not yet tied together this particular investigation with why they 
lost a large amount of cocaine or why a bag of money disappeared," Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to customs agents and sheriff's deputies, the FBI and police in 
Chicago, Houston, Detroit, New York, Los Angeles, Glendale, Orange County and 
Santa Paula assisted in the investigation.

PARENTS ASK COUNCIL TO BACK CHILDREN'S MUSEUM; THOUSAND OAKS: A NATIVE PEOPLES 
CENTER IS ALSO PROPOSED FOR LAND ADJACENT TO THE CIVIC ARTS PLAZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Parents in Thousand Oaks are urging the City Council to consider building a 
children's museum next to the Civic Arts Plaza, which they say would make the 
new cultural center more appealing to families. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is set to decide Tuesday whether they want staff members to 
research the request for a children's museum while also reviewing a proposal 
for a native peoples museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents began campaigning for a children's museum several months ago, and 
presented the council with a letter signed by about 3,000 residents on Tuesday. 
The letter recommends construction of the museum on 11 acres at the eastern end 
of the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Jaime Zukowski said the council should recognize that the need 
for such a museum has been ignored for too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been tremendous support for a children's museum in the community, 
and this seemed to be an appropriate time to look into it," Zukowski said. 
"It's really something that this area needs and does not have." 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski said the city has known about public interest in a children's museum 
for some time, but hasn't aggressively pursued the idea because it is not 
viewed as a revenue producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the council approved 60 hours of staff time to review a plan for a 
native peoples museum, and Zukowski said it would be unfair not to consider the 
idea of a children's museum as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all fairness, this has been an identified desire for some time," she said. 
"The idea of putting a museum up should involve looking into more than just one 
type of museum." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who supported the idea of a children's museum said they were excited 
that the council may finally take up their issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an incredible children's museum in downtown L.A. and there's a nice 
little one in Oxnard. We just wanted the city to think about putting one in 
between," said Mary Ann Downs, who helped draft the letter to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started as a bunch of parents sitting around with this idea, and we'd like 
to see it become something more than that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Downs said she envisions a museum where children can learn about the world 
around them by touching and exploring items that would normally be off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have to be anything super-duper fancy," said Downs, who has a 
3-year-old child and has worked as a child development specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "A children's exhibit is something hands-on, where they can play with skeletal 
bones or try on a firefighter's uniform or go into a recording studio and make 
up a song," she said. "Interactive learning plays a crucial role in a child's 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah said she supports the idea of a children's museum because 
it would fit into the Thousand Oaks community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousand Oaks has always been a magnet for families," Zeanah said. "I think 
this is a very desirable endeavor."

PRECIPITATION PELTS AREA, MORE DUE; DRIVING IS RISKY

 An unstable mass of air trailing Thursday's chilly storm dropped scattered 
rain, hail and snow on Southern California on Friday evening, and forecasters 
said a new storm should bring more precipitation tonight and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite briefly heavy rain in a number of areas Friday, there were no reports 
of new mudslides on the hillsides denuded during last fall's destructive brush 
fires in Laguna Beach, Malibu and Altadena.There were some slides in Malibu on 
Thursday, but damage was generally light. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Clemente, 12 cars collided on the rain-slick Interstate 5 Friday 
afternoon, slightly injuring one driver. All northbound lanes were shut down 
for about 15 minutes at Camino de Estrella as tow trucks moved the cars, said 
California Highway Patrol Officer Rick Pena. Traffic backed up for about a mile 
and a half, and was delayed about 45 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About a 10th of an inch of rain fell in southern Orange County Friday. 
Temperatures were expected to be in the mid -- 50s today. 
</P>
<P>
 Pea-size hail was reported during a blustery thundershower in Banning on 
Friday, and National Weather Service observers said their radar showed ice 
pellets in several cloudbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said heavy snow fell Friday afternoon at Idyllwild, Wrightwood and 
Big Bear City, with as much as six inches piling up in some areas by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow levels as low as 3,000 feet, with temperatures dropping into the 20s, 
were reported in some parts of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains 
Friday night. Police said driving conditions were hazardous in most mountain 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the center of the new storm will pass to the north of the Los 
Angeles area. They said there's a slight chance of a few additional sprinkles 
through Monday, with skies clearing again on Tuesday.

POLICE QUESTION MAN ON ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Port Hueneme police said Friday that a man arrested after allegedly trying to 
rob an Oxnard dairy store may be the suspect sought in two earlier armed 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 James Kenneth Myers, 29, was arrested on Thursday after a clerk at Chase 
Bros.Dairy foiled his robbery attempt by refusing to give him money and then 
chasing him down the street, police said. The clerk said he believed Myers' gun 
was fake. 
</P>
<P>
 After Myers was arrested following a foot chase, police found his car parked a 
short distance from the dairy store on Channel Islands Boulevard. It matched a 
vehicle linked to a robbery the day before at the Waffle Factory in Port 
Hueneme, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers also resembled a composite sketch drawn from witness descriptions of the 
man who robbed the Video Store on North Ventura Road on Feb. 4, Port Hueneme 
Police Sgt. Jerry Beck said.

SUSPECT SOUGHT IN 2 BANK ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back-to-back robberies at Bank of America branches on Friday may have been the 
work of one man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch at 3475 Via Lido was robbed about 1:15 p.m. of an unknown amount of 
money, Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said.A gunman walked in, confronted 
a teller and demanded cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five minutes later, the branch at 3300 E. Coast Highway was hit, also 
by a lone gunman, who escaped with an unknown amount of money, Gonis said. In 
that robbery, the gunman confronted several tellers simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses of each robbery described the suspect as a white man with a mustache 
who was wearing a jacket and a baseball cap, Gonis said.  
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in either incident, and no shots were fired, Gonis said.

MAN SHOT TO DEATH AT MARKET IN COSTA MESA IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man shot to death in a supermarket parking lot was identified Friday as 
Oscar Serrano Miramontes, 40, of Costa Mesa, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 21-year-old suspect, Salvador Beltran-Duarte of Santa Ana, was being held 
Friday in the city jail without bail, police investigator George Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beltran-Duarte was to be arraigned Tuesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators still did not know the motive in the shooting that occurred 
about 2 p.m. Thursday at the Stater Bros. market at 2180 Newport Blvd., Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not say whether the victim knew his suspected killer. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman accompanying Miramontes watched the shooting helplessly and cried 
loudly next to his body as the gunman fled in a Volkswagen Golf, witnesses told 
police. An onlooker reported the getaway car's license number, which allowed 
officers to spot and follow the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 During the chase, the driver of the Volkswagen threw out a revolver at a gas 
station at Newport Boulevard and 19th Street, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Ana officer saw the car as it entered Santa Ana. Police forced it to 
the side of the road in the 1100 block of North English Street and arrested 
Beltran-Duarte, Wilson said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; THE CASE OF THE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING; 
NORTHRIDGE: MALL CLEANUP WORKERS ARE CAUGHT WEARING ASBESTOS-TAINTED INVENTORY 
SLATED FOR DISPOSAL. BUT ARE THEY GUILTY OF ANY CRIME?

 When police showed up at the heavily damaged Sears store in the Northridge 
Fashion Center to investigate complaints that the cleanup crew was clearing out 
more than asbestos in the wake of the earthquake, they were puzzled at first. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 members of the asbestos cleanup crew were wearing brand-new clothes 
out of contaminated and sealed-off areas inside the store, despite orders from 
Sears, Roebuck & Co. to legally dispose of the tainted items by sealing them 
and taking them to a toxic-waste dump, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But can you be charged with stealing something that has already been deemed 
rubbish? 
</P>
<P>
 After detaining crew members Thursday, police conferred with prosecutors in 
the city attorney and district attorney's offices. They determined that the 
answer is no -- that no theft had occurred, said Lt. John Dunkin of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. The men were released, and no charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean the cleanup crew is in the clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will also be meeting with the district attorney's staff and other 
authorities, Dunkin said, to ascertain whether crew members broke environmental 
laws regulating the disposal of hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is still to be explored is whether taking those contaminated items 
constitutes some health-and-safety violation," he said. "We will explore that 
so we can answer the questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said the items apparently were exposed to asbestos as a result of the 
earthquake and were "commingled" with the debris. Sears "considered the 
clothing contaminated and wanted it disposed of," Dunkin said. "Apparently, 
rather than disposing it, the cleaning crew kept some part or all of the 
clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Regulations concerning the removal of asbestos -- who may do it and where and 
how it must be disposed of -- are stringent because the material is considered 
a potentially deadly carcinogen. If inhaled, asbestos fibers can cause lung and 
other cancers. However, the substance is considered safe when left intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Objects contaminated by asbestos, as the clothing may have been, would have to 
be thoroughly decontaminated before being removed from the site or would have 
to be disposed of by being properly bagged, labeled and hauled to a landfill 
approved to accept such waste, according to asbestos-removal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Sgt. Roger Dowis said mall security guards first noticed 
something was amiss and then caught the crew members late Thursday as they were 
wearing or carrying goods out of the closed-off store. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew stuff was being (taken) because they'd look at it and it was 
brand-new," Dowis said. "Security guards were looking at these guys and saying, 
'Hey! You're wearing Sears clothing, and Sears shoes that were brand-new.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of the workers were involved in this," Dowis said. "For two or 
three days, when they were working on the asbestos." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Graham, a Sears manager, said Friday that the company was investigating 
but had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos cleanup at the shopping center has required a massive, 
multimillion-dollar effort. The mall, located about a mile from the epicenter, 
was badly damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake and is expected to remain closed 
for at least several months. 
</P>
<P>
 One Sears employee familiar with the situation said, "They wouldn't let us go 
in and get our personal effects because they are tainted with asbestos." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he said, the cleanup crew "were wearing new shoes when they were caught, 
and a few pair of pants each."

MYSTERY SURROUNDS MISSING MAN; INVESTIGATION: JAMES YOUNG, 73, OF QUARTZ HILL 
DISAPPEARED 13 MONTHS AGO. DETECTIVES ARE NOW LOOKING AT THE CASE AS A POSSIBLE 
MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirteen months ago, 73-year-old James Young went to Las Vegas for what was to 
be a short getaway and he still hasn't come home. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors feared for months that Young met with foul play. And it 
appears those fears are finally being taken seriously -- the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department Homicide Bureau began investigating Young's disappearance 
earlier this month as a possible murder. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no charges filed and homicide detectives say they are facing 
what they expect will be a long investigation. When Young was first reported 
missing, detectives from that bureau interviewed neighbors and a man named 
Michael Benanti, a 35-year-old landscaper and ex-convict who had moved into 
Young's spacious Quartz Hill home shortly after Young's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Benanti, who said he was Young's business partner, told a missing persons 
investigator that Young had met a woman named Rosie, married her and moved to 
Mexico -- leaving him in charge of his business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives spent Friday sifting through Young's home and personal records. 
</P>
<P>
 Making their job that much harder is the man at the center of the mystery: 
Young was a complicated person who led an eccentric life. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove a Porsche whose license plate letters stood for Greek God -- symbolic 
of his belief that he was the consummate ladies' man, even though friends say 
they never saw him do anything more than talk about women. 
</P>
<P>
 His huge back yard resembled a junk yard, littered with machinery he bought at 
auctions and the many cars and trucks he owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz and Trixie, his two Rottweilers, shared his water bed with him at night. 
Friends say he loved the ferocious-looking dogs like the children he never had. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all else, Young was a penny-pinching, cantankerous old man who got along 
best with those who yelled back as he cursed them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a pain in the ass," said friend Cindy McEuen of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Porsche and its vanity plates are gone. Much of the back yard's 
contents are missing. Fritz and Trixie, who were left unattended when Young 
went to Las Vegas, are nowhere to be found. And neither is Young. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 2, more than a year after his disappearance and 12 months after a 
friend reported him missing, Young's case was moved from missing persons to the 
homicide bureau because of the "suspicious circumstances," said Detective 
Michael Scott of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Homicide Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Young just fell off the face of the Earth," the detective said. Young's 
bank accounts have sat idle for more than a year; there's no evidence he's 
received medical care in either California or Nevada, and all other paths of 
inquiry to find Young alive have led nowhere. Now they're trying to find a 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors have feared for months that Young met with foul play. 
</P>
<P>
 Running off, leaving behind his dogs, and abandoning all the possessions he 
had amassed are too out of character for Young to be even remotely plausible, 
friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 Possessions were important to Young, a retired machinist who liked to wheel 
and deal and buy equipment. "He liked to go to auctions and buy crates of 
things," said his friend, McEuen. 
</P>
<P>
 He was only going to Las Vegas to drop off one of his three campers at a 
trailer park. He was doing it, friends said, so he could avoid the expense of 
hotels when he went to gamble, a recreation he enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very frugal, to say the least," said Martin Vogel, a neighbor who said 
when he had Young to breakfast "the old man" complained about the eggs and 
coffee so much Vogel almost threw him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaining was as much a part of life for Young as eating and drinking. If 
the food at a restaurant wasn't served the way Young had ordered it, "he'd send 
it back, with a loud voice," McEuen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a man who was used to getting his way," she said. "It was his way or 
no way." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogel said, "He would ask for help, then you'd go over and help him and he'd 
start screaming at you." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as 30 years ago, McEuen said, Young completely cut off relations with 
his only sibling, a sister, because of a disagreement. Most people who knew 
Young didn't know he had any relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim always told me, 'I ain't got no God-damn relatives,' that all his money 
was going to (the state)," said Herb Williams, a friend who lives in Young's 
North Hollywood home, which is one of at least two facing foreclosure because 
the mortgage payments haven't been made in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even some confusion about how many times Young was married; it's 
either once or twice depending on who you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple years ago Young had considered marrying a young Filipino woman with 
whom he had become acquainted through letters and pictures. He was attracted to 
younger, foreign women, some say because he was looking for a caretaker as much 
as a wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before Christmas in 1990, Young suffered a stroke. A couple years ago he 
had another one. Although he recovered quickly, he was left with a limp and a 
speech impediment. The strokes frustrated Young. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his inability to do heavy labor that led Young to befriend Benanti, the 
man who said Young ran off to Mexico. Benanti worked for the landscape company 
that installed the shrubs and grass in the pricey Quartz Hill tract where Young 
moved in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was, not surprisingly, unhappy with the landscaping work at his new 
home. Benanti came to Young's house in response to the complaints and within a 
short time, Benanti was mowing Young's lawn and maintaining the plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither neighbors or friends knew much about Benanti and when he moved into 
Young's house shortly after Young's Las Vegas trip it raised some eyebrows. 
Other than Fritz and Trixie, Young did not have housemates. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say Benanti hasn't been at Young's house much in the past few weeks. 
After a date for the foreclosure sale was set earlier this month, Benanti began 
removing a lot of things from the house, including the back-yard spa. Benanti's 
whereabouts are unknown to detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives are now trying to freeze Young's assets and halt the foreclosures, 
Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, investigators changed the locks on the house and put yellow 
police tape around it. 
</P>
<P>
 While friends and neighbors fear the worst, they still maintain some hope that 
Young is alive. Investigators are just beginning what is expected to be a long 
search for some sign of the cantankerous old man, a sign that now may have 
faded.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; LAST 2 DISTRICT SCHOOLS CLOSED BY QUAKE BRACE 
FOR REOPENINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When the school bell finally marks the beginning of the new semester at John 
F. Kennedy High School on Tuesday morning, students will find a campus where 
bungalows have replaced many of the once-familiar classrooms that were made 
unsafe by last month's massive earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy and El Camino Real High School, which is scheduled to resume classes 
Wednesday, are the last L.A. Unified District schools to reopen. They have been 
closed since the 6.8-magnitude Northridge quake caused major damage to both 
campuses Jan. 17.  
</P>
<P>
 Using a patchwork of trucked-in trailers and parts of buildings not damaged by 
the temblor, school officials have been working tirelessly to reconstruct their 
campuses and maintain their humor in the face of what will almost certainly be 
a trying start to the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always mass confusion the first day of the semester; this will just 
be a little more," joked Kennedy office assistant Roberta Thompson.  
</P>
<P>
 Pete Fries, Kennedy's assistant principal, has been hoping that good planning 
will forestall some of the chaos on the Granada Hills campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Huddling with groups of teachers who wandered through the campus and told him 
their concerns, Fries on Friday was still trying to distribute bungalow keys, 
paint new parking stalls in the rain, set up classroom furniture and equip 
classrooms with such basic educational tools as pencils and paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try to anticipate everything that's going to happen, and you try to plan 
for everything," Fries said. "You sit home at night and say, 'What's going to 
come up and what's the solution to that problem?' But there is always that one 
thing that's going to get you." 
</P>
<P>
 Since several projects will not be finished until Monday, El Camino Principal 
Joyce Washington said that reserving a day for staff orientation and 
last-minute problems means that she cannot open the Woodland Hills school until 
Wednesday at the earliest.  
</P>
<P>
 And it has been that way all along. District officials initially surveyed the 
damage to the two high schools and said they could not open before March 7. 
When groups of parents demanded a quicker response, the district pledged to 
open sooner.  
</P>
<P>
 But as a revised start date of Feb. 15 drew closer, officials were forced to 
acknowledge that the new plans were too ambitious. A series of new 
complications, including rain and high wind, hampered the delivery and 
installation of the bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, district officials warned that they had notebooks full of 
problems at both schools. Asbestos exposed during the quake had to be removed. 
Heating and cooling apparatus needed to be revamped. Downed ceiling and 
lighting systems had to be replaced. School books, papers, and files had to be 
relocated. Some damaged buildings had to be redesigned to be brought up to 
current building codes.  
</P>
<P>
 And students had to be graded for their fall work, placed into spring 
programs, offered interim classes and informed of each of those plans. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Camino, almost all regular classrooms will be uninhabitable for the next 
two months; at Kennedy, students will be out of their regular rooms for at 
least the rest of the semester. District officials decided in the first days 
after the quake that for students, all bets were off. Finals, which were 
supposed to have been been in the last week of January, were canceled. Extra 
work or outstanding assignments could be turned in but were not mandatory, and 
semester grades would be recorded as they stood -- although there was some room 
for negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The physical plant was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first week after the quake, neither school had gas, water or 
electricity, said Doug Brown, the district's director of facilities. After 
utilities were back on line, they revealed the water and gas-line ruptures 
caused by the quake, meaning they had to be shut off again for repairs.  
</P>
<P>
 Once leaks were fixed, aftershocks kicked in automatic shut-offs and sent 
workers back to check for new breaks in the lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a roller coaster," Brown said. "You go down to the bottom and 
get things fixed, and then you get another significant aftershock and you go 
back down to the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 At El Camino, district officials determined that 102 classrooms were not 
usable because of stress cracks in the masonry, downed ceilings and loosened 
non-bearing partition walls. The roof on the cafeteria and school store 
building was also deemed unsafe and rain ruined the gymnasium floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said 51 rooms at El Camino will be repaired within the next 30 days; 51 
more will be ready 30 days after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems at Kennedy were more serious. The administration building, with all 
the school's offices and two floors of classrooms, was condemned, and a 
replacement or significantly revamped building is not likely to be ready for 
two years, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the B and C buildings, minor stress damage to interior walls, cracked 
plaster, falling light systems, ceilings that must be redesigned, and water 
damage will likely render the buildings useless for the next three to four 
months, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bungalows themselves have been an unending headache. Getting them to the 
schools -- and wired for power and gas -- was one matter. At Kennedy, Fries 
said, the last bungalow was not in place until Feb. 10 because the truck 
bringing it broke down. At El Camino, workers were scrambling to carpet the 
last of 39 bungalows that had arrived during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the reconstruction process, parents and students have given the 
district a mixed review: alternating between quiet acceptance at a Kennedy 
parents' meeting to hostile jeering at a similar meeting for El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials say the best referendum on their performance has been the 
low transfer rate: Although rules for changing schools were liberalized for 
students within the hardest-hit areas, Dick Browning, the district's director 
of the senior high school division, estimates that fewer than 1% have done so. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really an emergency drill," El Camino's Washington said with a sigh. 
"But it's not a practice. It's the real thing where you put into practice 
everything you have learned. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this were an ongoing thing, I'm sure it would get better over time. As it 
was, everyone did the best they could." 
</P>
<P>
 At Kennedy, Fries noted how far the school has come. He remembered his first 
view of the school: The windows were boarded up. Huge cracks rimmed the windows 
and crisscrossed the bricks. A walkway roof sagged out of alignment.  
</P>
<P>
 "Where do we start?" Fries recalled thinking. "The concept of having to build 
a school with 60 bungalows, a new boiler, a new set of wiring and all new 
phones in five weeks had not hit at that time."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; RUMORS ENHANCE ACTUAL SIZE OF QUAKE, EXPERTS 
SAY; SEISMOLOGY: CONFUSION AMONG DIFFERENT SCALES FUELS BELIEFS THAT TEMBLOR 
WAS LARGER THAN REPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Confusion over different kinds of measurements of the size of the Northridge 
earthquake has led to rumors, growing into convictions in some quarters, that 
the quake was bigger than it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that numbers used in some measurements -- such as the 
Modified Mercalli scale, or gravity force readings from strong motion 
accelerographs -- are frequently higher than those used by scientists in news 
reports of the magnitude of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A 9 or 10 reading on the Mercalli scale, normally stated in Roman numerals as 
IX or X, is not a magnitude reading, does not measure the same phenomena, and 
does not alter the 6.8-magnitude now used by the National Earthquake 
Information Center in Golden, Colo., to describe the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a chart that has been circulating in the San Fernando Valley by 
fax, or passed hand to hand, seems to say that the quake reached an unheard-of 
magnitude 9.8 in San Fernando and 9.5 in Northridge, among other spots. But 
these are not magnitude readings, seismologists and Caltech researchers pointed 
out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some callers to The Times have said the chart comes from Caltech. But Caltech 
spokesmen say the school put out no such chart, noting that, in any case, there 
is only one magnitude reading per quake, which does not vary from one community 
to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magnitude of an earthquake does not change with location," a Caltech 
spokesman said. "The Northridge earthquake was (the same) whether you live in 
Northridge or in San Diego."  
</P>
<P>
 The commonly used magnitude scales are based on the power of the earthquake at 
the spot where it started, although they also reflect the length of the fault 
rupture and the duration of the shaking. The Northridge earthquake could not 
have been an 8, scientists say, because the fault rupture was not long enough, 
nor did the shaking last long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.8-magnitude quake lasted, including reverberations of quake waves, no 
more than 30 seconds. By contrast, the shaking from the great Alaska earthquake 
of 1964, whose magnitude was put by some scientists at 8.9, lasted as long as 
seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity of the shaking, moment by moment, might not have been much 
stronger than the worst moments of the Northridge earthquake, but the Alaska 
quake is rated as more powerful because it lasted longer and affected a bigger 
area, seismologists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge magnitude, first put at 6.6, was later officially upgraded to 
6.8 by the scientists at Golden, using a surface wave scale, and to 6.7 by 
Caltech, the U.S. Geological Survey and UC Berkeley, using a moment magnitude 
scale of quake waves that have passed through the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these groups used the old Richter scale, which has fallen into disuse 
because it distorts readings of quakes larger than magnitude 5. Caltech 
scientist Egill Hauksson noted recently that the Richter reading of the 
Northridge quake would have been only 6.4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercalli scale, developed by the Italian seismologist Giuseppi Mercalli in 
1902, and modified by American seismologists Harry Wood and Frank Neumann in 
1931, is a set of criteria, numbered from I to XII, that is used to describe a 
quake as it is variably experienced at many different locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a quake may rate a XII ("Damage is total, and practically all works of 
construction are damaged greatly or destroyed") near the epicenter. But the 
same quake would rate only a I ("Not felt by people, except under especially 
favorable circumstances") at another place, several hundred miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the scale is based on subjectively perceived affects, rather than 
objectively measured ground movement, it has fallen out of use by 
seismologists. 
</P>
<P>
 The authorized descriptions are fairly lengthy, and most anyone who has felt a 
quake, by reading through the criteria under each Roman numeral, can form a 
conclusion as to what the Mercalli scale reading was where he or she felt the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, at a hearing of the California Seismic Safety Commission, Richard 
Andrews, the director of the state Office of Emergency Services, released a map 
of "estimated Modified Mercalli intensities" for the Northridge quake, 
developed by EQE, a firm in San Francisco. Andrews hoped the map would show the 
quake in a different perspective, with its widely varying affects. 
</P>
<P>
 The map showed various Mercalli intensities, ranging from X in Northridge and 
Reseda, down to VI in Malibu, Torrance, Carson, Long Beach and other points, 
and less than VI farther away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercalli definition for X shown on the map was: "Most masonry and frame 
structures destroyed with their foundations. Some well-built wooden structures 
and bridges destroyed. Serious damage to dams, dikes, embankments. Large 
landslides . . . Rails bent slightly." 
</P>
<P>
 The definition for VI was: "Felt by all. Many frightened and run outdoors. 
Persons walk unsteadily. Windows, dishes, glassware broken. Knick knacks, 
books, etc. off shelves. Pictures off walls. Furniture moved or overturned. 
Weak plaster and masonry cracked." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people from Van Nuys, which was mostly assigned a IX, felt that the 
shaking in their neighborhood was, instead, a VI, and they also questioned why 
nearby Sherman Oaks, where damage was greater, was assigned only an VIII, less 
than Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews, when asked about such matters, noted that the map reflected a 
computer model and not interviews with residents of specific neighborhoods 
coming to a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Scawthorne, EQE's vice president for research and development, readily 
agreed Friday that the map released last week "is based on certain 
approximations," and where more than one type of shaking occurred within a 
neighborhood, he acknowledged that the Mercalli measurement had split the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the main message is, this map is a simplified picture of the effects 
of the earthquake," he concluded. "In general, it's accurate. In detail, it may 
not be." 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, the chart being circulated by unknown parties in the Valley 
appears to list EQE's assigned Mercalli levels as if they were magnitudes. 
Changing Roman numerals to Arabic ones, it conveys the false impression that 
the magnitude for the quake was higher than announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Scawthorne said he believes that another type of quake measurement -- 
accelerographic instruments measuring gravity forces, which has come more into 
vogue in the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake -- should be a preferred 
form of measurement. 
</P>
<P>
 These numbers, such as the extraordinarily high 1.82g Tarzana reading reported 
in a Times story Friday, show shaking intensities at various points, and may be 
a better way of gauging the strength of an earthquake at various points than 
either magnitude or Mercalli scales. 
</P>
<P>
 But accelerographs must be there before the quake occurs, and in most recent 
quakes, they have been too widely scattered to provide a comprehensive picture.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; FOURTH MALL GARAGE TO BE DEMOLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fourth and final parking garage at Northridge Fashion Center has been 
slated for demolition, mall managers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Miller, general manager, said a garage on the east side of the mall off 
Tampa Avenue will be torn down within 10 days for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The garage was heavily damaged in the Jan. 17 quake. The rubble of one garage, 
which collapsed in the quake, has already been removed. The others were left 
standing, but were structurally damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 A garage on the north side of the mall is being removed this week, and last 
week officials announced the largest parking structure, situated on the west 
side of the mall, would also be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said engineers completed an analysis of the garage on Tampa Avenue and 
found that some of the pillars inside were leaning. Miller stopped short of 
saying the fourth garage would be impossible to render safe. He said only: "We 
have some doubts so we are going to remove it." 
</P>
<P>
 The garage was built in 1971 using concrete poured in place, as was the garage 
on the west side of the mall. The two other parking structures were built in 
1988 and 1989 using precast concrete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are to replace all four garages, Miller added. JILL LEOVY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RAIN EXPECTED TO TAPER OFF THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Showers were expected to taper off this weekend and give way to sunny skies by 
Monday as the Alaskan storm that dropped from one to three inches of rain on 
Ventura County moves eastward, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 20% chance of showers remains today, with dark and cloudy skies throughout 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have some lingering rain showers," said David Gomberg, a 
meteorologist for the National Weather Service. "But it looks like we will be 
back to more of the usual -- warm and dry -- through most of next week," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm brought up to 1.5 inches to the coast and inland valleys, and left 
two to three inches in the mountain areas, Gomberg said. Snow levels dropped to 
3,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Pinos, which stands at 8,900 feet, was dusted with six inches of snow, 
said Tracie Welton, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman. A break in the 
threatening skies could trigger an influx of people heading to the mountains 
above Ojai over the Presidents' Day weekend, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could get up to 10,000 to 20,000 cars a day," Welton said. "The weekend 
brings a lot of cross-country skiers and people who like to play in the snow." 
</P>
<P>
 Welton warned visitors to drive cautiously and carry chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain caused several minor accidents around the county, California Highway 
Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also helped efforts to clean up an oil spill caused when a pipeline 
ruptured during last month's earthquake. Crews have been working since then to 
clean up an estimated 147,000 gallons of crude oil that poured into the Santa 
Clara River from a ruptured Atlantic Richfield pipeline in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water helped a bit because it flushed out remaining oil trapped in 
sediments and vegetation," said Bob Schlichting, California Department of Fish 
and Game spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlichting said the remaining oil is difficult to remove. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a light sheen of oil on the river now; unfortunately it's not 
thick enough for us to recover," he said. The remaining oil has also mixed with 
dirt and vegetation, he said. "There's still oil out there that birds and 
animals can get into." County Rainfall

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; BUSINESSES ASSESSING FULL IMPACT OF QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake has dealt a more serious blow to San Fernando's 
small business community than was previously thought, according to the city's 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on preliminary estimates, the temblor caused $12 million to $24 million 
in structural damage to businesses, said Bruce Cohen, executive vice president 
of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you, that is just the tip of the iceberg," Cohen said Friday. 
"We're trying to take a look at what it will take to bring these businesses 
back, and that's a lot of money. In addition, some businesses are up and 
running, but they're on one leg." 
</P>
<P>
 There are between 800 and 850 licensed businesses operating in the 
2.4-square-mile city, and officials are bracing for a serious jolt to sales tax 
revenues, City Administrator Mary Strenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando gets a 1% return from the state's 6.5% sales tax -- amounting to 
$4 million a year, Strenn said. That represents nearly a third of the city's 
general fund -- the part of the budget that pays for such things as police and 
daily operating expenses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sales tax is the most vulnerable," she said. "A lot of the impacts we won't 
feel immediately. It usually takes a minimum of a quarter (of a fiscal year) 
for sales tax receipts to be returned to us." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that 12 commercial structures housing 14 businesses 
were destroyed; another 52 buildings housing 61 businesses have been deemed 
unsafe, and 25 structures with 35 businesses are posted for limited access. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber and city officials fear that even those businesses that still can 
function might not survive the downturn in customer flow and the expense of 
replacing destroyed inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think about the fact that these businesses already had come through 
three years of recession, their cushion is gone," Strenn said. "Their staying 
power is depleted." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not all is doom and gloom. Construction and repairs could bring in more 
tax receipts and boost some businesses. The chamber also has found some of the 
businesses it is helping are more willing to join and pay dues, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, perhaps following the adage "If life gives you lemons, make lemonade," 
the chamber will hold a seminar next week to delve into ways to use the 
earthquake as a marketing tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain things you can do after an earthquake to improve business, 
like earthquake sales," Cohen said. GEOFFREY MOHAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; MALL CAN'T SERVE ALCOHOL IN PATIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials denied a popular mini-mall permission to serve alcohol in an 
open-air patio because the mall lacks sufficient parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Landini, a city zoning administrator, said the owners of the Laurel 
Promenade on Ventura Boulevard failed to provide enough parking spaces, more 
than one valet to park cars and reneged on a promise to not develop the 
2,021-square-foot covered patio. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they submitted just wasn't adequate," Landini said. "We found that some 
parking spaces were unusable. They had equipment in them or gas meter boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Landini said owners of the property had only one valet to park 
cars on a two-level parking area and had previously promised the city that they 
would use the patio area for pedestrian traffic only. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will deal with this as we have addressed everything else," said Tom 
O'Brien of Handelman Catherman Inc., who represents the owners of the 
mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The setback is the latest in a string of problems for the mini-mall. Residents 
protested the mall's opening when the developer failed to install additional 
turn lanes at the congested intersection as promised and again when the 
developer installed more signs than is allowed under local ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said the owners will appeal the decision this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said owners of the mini-mall failed to recognize the scale of the 
parking problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be hard to plan with what is already a built-in parking 
disaster," said Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City Residents Assn. "The 
mini-mall's demands are too big for the space allotted. They are trying to 
squeeze in too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Henry, planning deputy to Councilman Joel Wachs, said the decision was 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not working. The cars are on top of each other. No one would want to 
park there," he said, calling the mall owners "a victim of their own success."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; CHILDREN'S SERVICES GETS 2 NEW OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regional employees of the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services 
who were displaced by the earthquake were relocated this week to two new 
temporary offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake shook the Panorama City offices of the department's 
Region 5 so severely that the building was deemed unsafe for occupancy by the 
department's 200 employees.In the weeks that followed, social workers resorted 
to doing casework from home using their own telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 Region 5 provides children's services to an area stretching from the Antelope 
Valley to the San Fernando Valley. The agency is responsible for foster care, 
placement services, and intervention in child abuse cases. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, 60 clerical and supervisory workers finished moving into newly 
leased temporary offices at 6454 Van Nuys Blvd., said Evelyn Syvertsen, deputy 
regional administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Berger, director of DCS special services, said Thursday that officials 
were in the final stages of negotiation for a lease on a second building in the 
vicinity. Syvertsen said some employees may continue working from home for 
several months because of limited space in the new quarters.  
</P>
<P>
 The department is evaluating what equipment and supplies are needed to 
function efficiently, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing has been so traumatic," Syvertsen said, adding that several 
employees have lost homes or property in the quake. Asked whether the 
displacement had affected services, she said: "I really couldn't give you an 
honest answer. Workers are making every effort to provide services." JILL LEOVY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; PANEL URGES RAZING 47-YEAR-OLD STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 47-year-old Olive Memorial Stadium, once the site of the St. Louis Browns' 
spring training and professional football tryouts, should be torn down and 
replaced with a modern facility, a special study committee has recommended to 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful stadium," said John Dominguez, a member of the Burbank Parks 
and Recreation board, who once played baseball there for John Burroughs High 
School. "It's reminiscent of yesteryear." 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium has been closed in recent years for safety reasons. Although city 
officials have long considered tearing it down, there has been some public 
opposition, especially from those who remember the stadium's heyday when 
baseball legends like Satchel Paige, Bobby Thompson and others played there. 
</P>
<P>
 Park board member Terre Hirsch began a campaign to save the building, which 
led to the formation of the special committee made up of representatives of 
various community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a very sensitive issue," Hirsch said Wednesday night after 
committee members overwhelming voted in favor of tearing down the stadium to 
build a new one. The recommendation goes to the parks and recreation board, 
which will vote March 10 on whether to send the proposal to the City Council. 
"But this is the best way to deal with this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saying we should bite the bullet now and build a new facility," said Gary 
Sutliff, a member of the Burbank Historical Society and a committee member. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the committee members acknowledged the sentiment attached to the 
building, but voted for tearing down the structure in favor of a more modern 
facility for the city's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore Garcia, president of the Burbank Historical Society, said the 
society's board had voted not to try to protect the building because it did not 
have enough historic merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because it is old does not mean it is historically significant," Garcia 
said. "When we reviewed the building, we did not find anything architecturally 
significant." 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch said he would not predict yet what the parks and recreation board will 
do with the recommendation. ED BOND

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BERMAN PUSHES FOR QUAKE TAX RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) on Friday pledged to push Congress to 
grant income tax relief to Los Angeles residents whose damages from the 
Northridge earthquake aren't high enough to be deducted from their federal 
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman told a meeting of the San Fernando Chamber of Commerce that a bill he 
introduced this month would remove a restriction on deductible casualty losses, 
which now must exceed 10% of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income before they can 
be subtracted. If the restriction is removed, taxpayers could deduct the full 
amount of the casualty loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake insurance typically carries a steep deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Many taxpayers face losses too low to meet their insurance deductible or the 
10% threshold, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huge numbers of people will not be getting grants or loans," said Berman, 
whose 26th Congressional District includes San Fernando. "It's going to wipe 
out the life savings of people." 
</P>
<P>
 With a host of California co-sponsors, Berman introduced the tax reform bill 
Feb. 8. It is currently in the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodded by business owners irritated over government regulation, Berman agreed 
that the disaster showed federal officials could cut red tape if they had the 
will.  
</P>
<P>
 He said Congress might reconsider some of the regulations it enacted, however 
well-intentioned they may have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the procedures bogging down government were enacted to deal with 
other abuses," Berman noted. "Maybe there's a logic to re-examining how much of 
what we were hoping to achieve we actually accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman also pledged to keep the federal government focused on 
California's more long-term disasters: the collapse of the defense industry and 
the deep recession plaguing the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the defense-conversion issues will be continued," Berman said after 
the address. "They (the White House) are aware of the importance of California 
to the economy and to the elections." 
</P>
<P>
 For Berman, Friday's appearance also was a chance to hear praise for the 
federal relief effort in the San Fernando Valley, particularly in the city of 
San Fernando.  
</P>
<P>
 City and chamber officials credit him with persuading federal agency heads to 
open a disaster aid center in San Fernando, and ensuring that the small city 
did not get lost in wider relief efforts. GEOFFREY MOHAN

DOG'S OWNER JAILED FOR ORDERING ATTACK; HATE CRIME: PAUL MICHAEL KUNS, WHO IS 
WHITE, GETS SIX MONTHS FOR SENDING PIT BULL AFTER CARL JOHNSON, A BLACK 
TEEN-AGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In an attack described as a hate crime by prosecutors, a West Hollywood man 
has been sentenced to six months in jail for ordering his pit bull to attack a 
black teen-ager who was skateboarding in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Michael Kuns, a 38-year-old white man, was sentenced immediately after a 
Van Nuys Municipal Court jury convicted him on misdemeanor charges of assault 
and interfering with a person's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Following two hours of deliberations, the jury determined Thursday that Kuns 
sent his dog after Carl Johnson, 15, as Johnson and a friend, Michael Hynes, 
16, of Van Nuys, skateboarded Oct. 24 in the 4800 block of Laurel Canyon 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dog ran up to him and attempted to bite his lower legs, Johnson was 
forced to jump from his skateboard and into the street, according to Deputy 
City Atty. KjehlT. Johansen. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog never bit Johnson, according to the evidence presented during a 
three-day trial, but the animal did bite into the skateboard. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dog returned to Kuns, Hynes asked Kuns, "Are you crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kuns replied with a racial epithet, according to the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Johnson fled the scene, according to the prosecutor, Kuns asked Hynes "in 
essence, why he wasn't hanging around with his own kind." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuns was arrested six weeks after the attack after police tracked him using a 
license plate number that Hynes had obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Virginia Montecino did not present a defense in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the trial and sentencing, Judge Robert Wallerstein called Johnson, 
Hynes and Johnson's mother into his chambers. "He took some time to reassure 
them the system does work," Johansen said.

<P>
 Actor and environmentalist Ed Begley Jr. was unanimously confirmed Friday by 
the Los Angeles City Council to represent the city on the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy board. 
</P>
<P>
 Begley, who was nominated by Mayor Richard Riordan, was appointed to the 
eight-member panel that sets policy for the conservancy, a state agency that 
buys parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains and neighboring ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Begley, a Studio City resident who is best known for his role in the 
television series "St. Elsewhere," was previously named to the city's 
Environmental Affairs Commission, an advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking briefly to the council after being confirmed, Begley said he will 
"fulfill all the needs the city has" of him on the conservancy board. 
</P>
<P>
 Begley replaces Anton Calleia, a chief aide to former Mayor Tom Bradley and 
the city's representative on the conservancy board since 1982. HUGO MARTIN

BURBANK HIGH'S PROGRESSIVE PRINCIPAL DEMOTED BY SCHOOL BOARD; PERSONNEL: KEIKO 
HENTELL ENCOURAGED MULTIETHNIC GROUPS AT THE SCHOOL. OFFICIALS WON'T DISCUSS 
THE ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The principal of Burbank High School has been demoted to English teacher, in a 
move made by the Burbank school board behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither board members nor top administrators would discuss the reasoning 
behind the decision announced at the close of Thursday night's meeting of the 
Burbank Unified School District Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 But some teachers and community members speculated that Keiko Hentell, 
principal since 1991, was being replaced at least partly because of her 
progressive policies in encouraging multiethnic groups at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some programs in place which Burbank, not traditionally a 
minority's school, might not have been ready for," said Jack Kemp, a health 
teacher at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in a state of shock. I think we had a lady who was taking the school in 
a direction that was very positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell said Friday she was told by Supt. Arthur Pierce on Feb. 4 that her 
contract would not be renewed. Because she had recently received tenure in the 
district, the board had to offer her a teaching position in the fall, she said. 
She will continue to serve as principal until the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although you have attempted to address the needs of the increasingly diverse 
student body at Burbank High School, the decision-making process and 
relationships within the community at large need considerable improvement," 
Hentell said Pierce wrote to her in a memo. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials refused to comment Friday. "It's a personnel issue and I 
can't discuss it," board President Elena Hubbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hentell joined the district three years ago from a job as an assistant 
principal at University High School in Los Angeles, she inherited a school that 
was becoming increasingly more diverse with growing Latino, Armenian and Asian 
populations.  
</P>
<P>
 The school traditionally had had a large white enrollment. But now, white 
students are barely in the minority at 48%. Latinos make up 39% of the student 
body; blacks 3%, and 7.4% are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for ethnic diversity have applauded Hentell's efforts to work with 
the groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a tragedy, without a doubt," the Rev. John Simmons, a retired 
Lutheran minister and head of the Burbank Human Relations Council, said of the 
board's action. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was created to promote understanding among ethnic groups, and 
Hentell had asked for its help in solving many of the growing racial tensions 
she found at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We applauded it when she came here and we have applauded her ever since she 
arrived," Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Hentell's leadership, student groups formed to promote ethic culture and 
Latino groups and other programs were encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell said she also focused on decentralizing decision-making at the school, 
involving students, parents and teachers in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the absence of any direction from the board, I had no choice but to forge 
a new direction," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell said she will seek employment elsewhere.

JEWELRY STORE WORKER KILLED IN ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jewelry store employee was shot and killed in a robbery Friday, Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies responded to a 911 call at 1:11 p.m. from a person who looked into 
Charles Jewelers, at 38513 Sierra Highway, and saw smashed display cases, said 
Deputy Larry Mead of the Sheriff's Headquarters Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deputies arrived and looked through the open door and saw the store's 
employee lying on the floor," Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who was working alone at the time, was a 45-year-old man, Mead 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man's name was not released pending notification of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 An undetermined amount of jewelry was taken from the store and there were no 
clues to the identity of the killer, Mead said.

MAN APPARENTLY DIED OF HEART ATTACK IN FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who died on Valentine's Day after he was punched by the live-in friend 
of his estranged wife apparently died of a heart attack and not head injuries 
he suffered during the altercation, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives originally believed that Charles Lovinggood, 45, died after he hit 
his head on a slate tile floor after Steven Cartrett, 29, slugged him twice 
Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the incident, police said Lovinggood was upset because Cartrett was 
living in a house with Marilyn Lovinggood, 45, who had been separated from her 
husband for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Lovinggood told police that she and Cartrett were only friends and 
that Cartrett was living there because the earthquake had damaged his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartrett was not charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office has not released the results of 
Lovinggood's autopsy, a spokesman said.

POLICE ARREST 2 MEN IN CONDEMNED BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested two men at a condemned apartment building Friday -- one for 
allegedly attempting to loot the building and the other for entering the 
building and giving the first man permission to take what he wanted, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Devonshire's Volunteer Surveillance Team, a citizens watch group, 
noticed Edgar Pearson Jr., 56, of Van Nuys, carrying a pickax into an apartment 
building in the 8500 block of Balboa Boulevard that had been red-tagged after 
the quake, Officer Martin Pinner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers later watched the man climb onto the roof and throw materials 
over the side, Pinner said. By the time police arrived, the suspect was loading 
copper wire and a sink into his truck, Pinner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told us there was a guy living in the building who gave him permission," 
Pinner said. "So we went in and arrested him too because he was living in 
someone else's apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 The second man, Leon Outten, 34, of Van Nuys, was arrested for entering a 
condemned building, Pinner said.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; MILITARY BROADCASTS CHANGE TUNE; AIRWAVES: TO KEEP PACE 
WITH MODERN AUDIENCES, ARMED FORCES RADIO AND TELEVISION RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS ARE 
LIVELIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Armed Forces Radio and Television broadcasts religious programs for the 1.3 
million servicemen and women overseas, but for many years the military airwaves 
typically carried worship services, Bible studies and music by the likes of the 
Mormon Tabernacle Choir. 
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder then that surveys of the predominantly young military personnel 
ranked religious shows at the bottom, almost as expendable in their minds as 
big band and classical music. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, Christian rock music -- including the metal variety -- black 
gospel singing, and Top 10 contemporary Christian music dominate the five 
weekly hours of religious radio offered to military stations. And the religious 
television package is livelier too, with magazine-format shows and religious 
video shows done in the MTV style. 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation was largely the effort of two chaplains who have acted as 
religious program coordinators at a little-known military facility in the San 
Fernando Valley -- the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service Broadcast 
Center in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, both radio and television religious programming . . . 
will be compatible with our audience's lifestyles and tastes," Army Maj. David 
Smith, the current religious program coordinator, wrote to fellow chaplains 
after the revamped schedules were introduced last April. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feedback was extremely positive from programmers at a meeting here last 
December, because 70% of our audience is between the ages of 18 and 28," Smith 
said in an interview. Gerald Fry, a civilian who directs programming and news 
at the Sun Valley center, confirmed that the changes have had a good response. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were my choice, I'd put the Mormon Tabernacle Choir on every week," 
said Fry, who has been in broadcasting since 1952. "But the more contemporary 
the program, the more popular they are compared to the old-style religion 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Fry credited Smith's predecessor, Air Force Maj. Richard Davenport, with 
launching the innovations. One well-received change, Fry said, was the 
introduction of religious-themed children's television programs for military 
families with small children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armed Forces Radio and Television Network, received by U. S. military 
bases in 128 countries and on ships at sea, selects news, sports, sitcoms, 
movies, specials and a variety of programming from the broadcast and cable 
networks. Extra news coverage of disasters such as the Northridge earthquake 
are picked up from the major broadcast networks and CNN and transmitted by 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 With a limited budget, which is diminishing with military cutbacks, the 
broadcast center relies on the patriotism of networks and producers to donate 
their products. 
</P>
<P>
 Some religious broadcasters go even further to accommodate Armed Forces 
Network needs. For instance, Pat Robertson's "700 Club" is pared down to a 
half-hour by his Family Channel editors and the Rev. Robert Schuller's "Hour of 
Power," the top-rated syndicated religious program in this country, is edited 
down to 30 minutes by technicians at the Crystal Cathedral, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "White Heat," the Christian metal program produced by broadcaster Ken Roberts 
of Torrance, is done free of charge solely for the military network. So is 
"Love on a Rock" (top hits) and "Amen Corner" (black gospel). 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't hear these programs anywhere else," said Smith, 38, a United 
Methodist minister who is halfway through his three-year assignment at the 
broadcast center. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a chaplain, I don't want to play the ratings game, but if the servicemen 
and women are not listening or watching, then we are not reaching them," he 
said. "The programmers overseas usually ran worship services and Bible study 
programs on Sunday morning -- when the people who might listen or watch were in 
chapel. We want to reach more than them." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that he changed the radio schedule to run some music programs for 
52 consecutive weeks -- instead of changing them every 13 weeks as before -- in 
order to build up a following. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the biggest concerns, however, are to balance programs for different 
religious faiths and ethnic groups and to assure that the spiritual 
exhortations do not include pleas for money. 
</P>
<P>
 On radio, "East of Eden," a Jewish program of music and talk, is offered at 
eight holiday times during the year. "Passages," an award-winning program with 
interviews of people whose faith helped them overcome traumatic experiences, is 
produced by the Presbyterian Media Mission in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 On television, "The Jesuit Journal" and "Catch the Spirit" offer interviews on 
current religious issues, from the Catholic and Methodist perspectives, 
respectively. When "Hour of Power" is not showing, the military network offers 
the upbeat "Outreach of Love" Sunday service from an African Methodist 
Episcopal church in Baltimore led by Pastor Frank Reid, formerly of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Network documentaries or specials on religious themes -- such as how churches 
and synagogues responded to Hurricane Andrew -- are picked up by the network. 
</P>
<P>
 Final approval of the program selections rests with a three-chaplain committee 
called the Audiovisual Advisory Group, but it is the religious program 
coordinator who searches program listings and monitors network feeds for new 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith picked up two television productions that focused on last September's 
Parliament of World Religions in Chicago -- a documentary from CBS and a series 
of interviews produced by the Faith & Values Cable Network featuring Hindu, 
Buddhist, Muslim, Bahai and other religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will really be beneficial because we have a very diverse audience," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 That very diversity means that the chaplain-coordinators have to review each 
program to make sure that no religious group is criticized or demeaned. The 
military programmers do not censor or edit programs, so the entire show has to 
be free of abusive references to meet government guidelines on fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got one complaint when I first came here that a program was unfair to a 
faith group, and when I looked at it, I had to agree," Smith said. "It turned 
out that was a program that went through the approval process in the three 
months between Maj. Davenport's assignment here and when I started."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ENROLLMENT FALLS BY 80 AT QUAKE-DAMAGED 
CALARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fewer than one in 10 students at earthquake-battered CalArts have withdrawn 
from the school, despite earlier concerns that $12 million to $15 million in 
campus damage would mean a drop in the quality of education. 
</P>
<P>
 According to preliminary figures Friday -- the final day that students could 
withdraw and receive a full refund of their $6,925 semester tuition -- about 80 
of the 964 students enrolled at the college have left. 
</P>
<P>
 In an average year, about 7% of the enrolled students withdraw, said Anita 
Bonnell, CalArts director of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a slightly higher amount of students appear to have left this semester, 
but some believe the 6.8-magnitude Northridge earthquake had a stronger effect 
on them than is now documented. 
</P>
<P>
 CalArts President Steven Lavine suggested 30 to 40 students might have 
abandoned their studies without officially withdrawing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are students that clearly just fled," Lavine said. "I think we'll find 
that out all semester. I think we'll find out there are students who paid their 
fees and registered, so we count them as enrolled (but who left))." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammered in the first week of the new semester by the Jan. 17 quake, CalArts 
twice extended the deadline for students to withdraw and get their money back. 
With limited access to CalArts' main building, courses have continued in an 
array of satellite classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fairly confident that through borrowed and rented facilities we could 
provide a serious education," Lavine said. "We wanted to give the students 
enough time to see that." 
</P>
<P>
 Art, film, critical studies and music composition classes are being held at a 
former Lockheed site in Valencia. Voice, speech and Tai Chi martial arts 
instruction are proceeding within the Valencia Industrial Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater classes have spread to facilities from the Vista Village shopping 
center to Magic Mountain. Dance courses are held at the Santa Clarita YMCA and 
a Pasadena studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that it's different," Lavine said. "We've gone from a 
campus where everything is at one site to where it's all over the Santa Clarita 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Lavine estimated the quake will cost the college up to $2 million for 
satellite classrooms and in lost tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the logistics nightmare, the majority of students apparently believe 
they can learn a lot at the school. An earlier petition that called for the 
college to refund up to one-third of the tuition because students would not get 
the education they had initially signed up to receive appears to have died. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, I think education is where you want it to be," said Wendell Seat, a 
22-year-old CalArts graduate student. "You learn what you want to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Quake damage has delayed shooting dates for Seat's film project -- scheduled 
to have begun Jan. 17 -- and postponed editing classes. But Seat said fewer 
students has meant greater access to instructors and the equipment that is 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
 In only his first year at the college, Seat said he has no plans to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't like to quit, I guess."

LILLEHAMMER: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; HARDING RAISES NEW QUESTIONS; FIGURE SKATING: 
SHE HAS DIFFICULTY IN PRACTICE, THEN AVOIDS QUERIES ABOUT THE ATTACK ON 
KERRIGAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Tonya Harding tried to use spin control at her first Norway news conference 
and restrict questions and comments to her skating, attention veered Friday 
from her legal situation to her physical condition and whether Harding will be 
able to skate in the Winter Olympics at all. 
</P>
<P>
 After observing Harding at practice in Hamar, one professional skating coach, 
Marie Millikan, told The Times, "I can tell something's wrong. She can't even 
stand on her landing leg." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding is experiencing pain in her right ankle. The U.S. Olympic Committee 
has until Monday to replace her if necessary with Michelle Kwan, 13, of 
Torrance, who arrived Thursday and is practicing in Lillestrom, near Oslo, 
where her coach pronounced her ready, willing and able. Competition for the 
women begins Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding quit practice early Friday but downplayed it later, saying, "I don't 
need to be ready right this second." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the landing leg of Nancy Kerrigan that a hired assailant set out to 
harm Jan. 6, after allegedly having been paid by Harding's ex-husband, Jeff 
Gillooly, to eliminate her top American rival. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the sale by Gillooly of film footage of a half-naked Harding that 
appeared on television and in newspapers, Harding, 23, said, "I am very upset 
and I am ashamed. I'm embarrassed. The one thing I have to say is, if everyone 
could put themselves in my position, how would you feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a USA uniform during her 37-minute meeting with media, Harding sat 
with her coach, Diane Rawlinson, to whom she deflected many questions. Harding 
had requested that her attorney also be at her side during the news conference, 
but USOC officials said they would grant her no privileges denied other 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 After fielding a few routine questions from a USOC spokeswoman, Harding 
appeared stunned by the first question from the floor. A New York Times 
reporter asked of Harding that, because she had "lied" about everything from 
smoking cigarettes to what she originally had told the FBI of her knowledge of 
the crime against Kerrigan and had even reportedly flunked polygraph tests, 
"Why should we believe anything you say now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rawlinson rushed to Harding's rescue with, "We're here to talk about Tonya's 
skating." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was nevertheless pressed for a response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with my coach," she finally said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other inquiries went unanswered, Harding calling the questions 
inappropriate. Among the non-skating issues Harding did address was to confirm 
that the American television program "Inside Edition" had signed the skater to 
an exclusive contract for an unspecified sum and that the Oregon-based Nike 
sporting-goods conglomerate also had donated funds to Harding, reportedly 
$25,000 that will go toward coaching expenses and legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 At mention of her having skipped the Winter Olympics' opening ceremony for the 
second time, Harding and her coach contended that a U.S. team leader had 
requested that the skater stay away. Harding viewed the Feb. 12 ceremony on 
television at her home in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how she felt, whether she was hurting inside, Harding replied, 
"Sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 However else she is hurting is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding clutched her right ankle in pain after one awkward landing during 
practice. Millikan, who has no athletes here but is working for the Associated 
Press, observed the difficulties Harding was having with her landing leg, even 
on routine maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 On one triple loop, Millikan said, "She came down really hard. She did it 
perfectly, but then she stepped off the ice and grabbed her ankle. It's 
absolutely hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, something is definitely bothering her. Some of the jumps, she 
just can't handle." 
</P>
<P>
 The skater expressed no concern that she will be unfit to compete. The reason 
she and her coach called off practice prematurely was because, Harding said, "I 
want to be perfect and I wasn't. We just decided I was done." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kwan, who was runner-up to Harding at the national championships 
last month in Detroit, is ready to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michelle skated great today, just great," one eyewitness told The Times. 
"She's ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding did not allude to Kerrigan here Friday except to say, "We both give 
each other respect on the ice. . . . I have a great deal of respect for Nancy." 
</P>
<P>
 She did acknowledge what she described as a "brief encounter" between them in 
the Olympic village two days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harding: "It was very positive. We said hello. It's kind of a private 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Randy Harvey contributed to this story from Hamar.

MAKING A LAST STAND; UCLA: DESPITE PAST SUCCESSES, COACHES OF SWIMMING, 
GYMNASTICS ARE STILL FIGHTING UPHILL BATTLE TO SAVE MEN'S PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon at UCLA, Coach Ron Ballatore stomped up and down the 
deck at the men's gym pool -- stopwatch in his hand, wool cap on his head -- 
bellowing about nothing in particular until his face turned red to the 
amusement of his swim team. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hundred yards away, in UCLA's Yates Gymnasium, Coach Art Shurlock leaned 
against a balance beam, quietly discussing a tumbling sequence with a member of 
his men's gymnastics team. 
</P>
<P>
 These are two men who, combined, have dedicated nearly half a century to 
coaching at UCLA -- with contrasting styles. 
</P>
<P>
 But today they are bonded by one factor: Their programs are scheduled to be 
eliminated after this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing an athletic department budget deficit of $900,000, UCLA announced last 
August it was dropping men's swimming, and men's and women's gymnastics after 
the 1993-94 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
 About two weeks later, facing the threat of a gender-equity lawsuit, school 
officials announced they would reinstate women's gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
 But for men's swimming and gymnastics, the athletes and coaches are preparing 
for the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The swim team will compete at USC today at 1 p.m., in the final dual meet 
between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The gymnastics team will compete in the 12-school UCLA Invitational tonight at 
7 in Pauley Pavilion. It is the last time the Bruin men and women will appear 
in a combined meet. 
</P>
<P>
 For the younger athletes, who accepted scholarships to UCLA because of the 
strong traditions of these programs, there will be opportunities to transfer to 
other schools and continue in athletics. But for many, the decision to continue 
competing or staying at UCLA, where they have built college lives, is 
difficult. The athletes will be allowed to remain on scholarship through 
graduation if they decide to stay in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Ballatore and Shurlock, the notion that it's almost over is nearly 
unfathomable. Ballatore said he will look for a position at another school. 
Shurlock probably will stay at UCLA and run a club team, hoping to get money 
from UCLA's recreation department and possibly from the U.S. Gymnastics 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ballatore and Shurlock do not want to consider the worst right now 
because, along with alumni, they are trying to save their programs. SOMETHING 
TO BRAG ABOUT 
</P>
<P>
 The traditions of these programs are something UCLA has proudly displayed over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Shurlock won NCAA titles in 1984 and '87, Ballatore in 1982. Both programs 
perennially finish among the nation's top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs also have produced a combined total of nearly 40 Olympians, 
including gymnasts Peter Vidmar, Tim Daggett and Mitch Gaylord, who led the 
United States to its first gold medal in 1984 at Pauley Pavilion, and five-time 
swimming gold medalist Tom Jager. 
</P>
<P>
 "(School officials) will sit around and they'll sure brag about that," 
Ballatore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to eliminate these sports, then, seems to send a message that 
success will not necessarily be taken into account when determining budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Before last summer, few realized the programs were in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballatore got his first hint in May when a booster offered to give $260,000 
over a six-year period to the men's swimming program, but school officials 
refused to give the donor a guarantee that the program would be around that 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 A week before the announcement, Shurlock got a call from a colleague at Ohio 
State who said he had heard UCLA was dropping its program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said: 'That's ridiculous. Why would they let us recruit if they were 
dropping the program?' " Shurlock recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Most were shocked when it was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think they would drop a program of such tradition and caliber at 
this school," said Sean Easton, a senior team captain on the men's swim team. 
</P>
<P>
 Easton, whose eligibility ends after this season, said he is sympathetic to 
the underclassmen, some of whom he helped recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, they're really upset," he said. "They say that they love school 
here and they don't want to leave, but they also love swimming, and that's what 
makes it really hard -- that they have to choose between the two." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no need to tell Michael Andrews, a prep All-American backstroker from 
St. Xavier High in Cincinnati, how tough that decision is. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews chose UCLA for its balance of athletics and academics. Now, a year 
later, he must reconsider schools that were his second and third choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure if I'm quite ready to quit (swimming)," Andrews said. "But the 
other teams I would be interested in, academically they just don't have it." 
GENDER EQUITY 
</P>
<P>
 Financial problems were cited as the reason for dropping the programs, but 
many say there is more to it than money. 
</P>
<P>
 If the department was looking to save money, why did it reinstate women's 
gymnastics? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was simple -- Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the 
federal legislation that bars sex discrimination in educational institutions. 
Courts have interpreted the law to encompass equal opportunity in athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 If the men's swimming and gymnastics programs are not reinstated, UCLA will be 
close to complying with the law by the 1994-95 academic year. UCLA would offer 
10 sports for men, 11 for women. But because so many athletes play football, 
men would account for about 57% of all participating athletes. This will bring 
UCLA within an acceptable range of equality. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, UCLA athletic officials maintain that the programs were not cut in an 
effort to comply with Title IX. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three sports we proposed to cut (including women's gymnastics) had 
everything to do with finances and nothing to do with trying to get our numbers 
in line," said Judith Holland, UCLA's associate athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 But at about the same time that the department cut the men's sports, it added 
women's soccer and announced plans to add women's water polo next year and 
still another women's sport by 1997. TWO SOLUTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Although UCLA officials say there is nothing they can do, Ballatore and 
Shurlock have taken steps to save their programs. Not surprisingly, the methods 
they have chosen are as different as their personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Past UCLA swimmers have rallied to try to raise the $6 million the athletic 
department has told them they need to endow the program. They have set a 
deadline of March 31 for raising the funds so the program's current athletes 
can decide whether to stay or transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 As of now, they are nowhere near their goal. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, even if they were to raise the money, gender equity might still 
stand in their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if (men's swimming) raised $6 million, there is no guarantee that it 
would be reinstated," said Mark Dellins, UCLA's sports information director, 
speaking on behalf of Athletic Director Peter Dalis. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that trying to raise that much money would be futile, Shurlock said the 
men's gymnastics team has retained a lawyer to sue the school for breach of 
contract and sex discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Halperin, a Los Angeles attorney who has donated his time to the team's 
cause, sent a letter to Chancellor Charles Young on Feb. 7, informing him of 
his intention to file a suit, but has not received a response. Similar suits by 
male athletes have been unsuccessful in other states. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, athletes and coaches in both programs are placing most of 
their hopes on winning national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 An NCAA title, they reason, might be like a lottery ticket, with the prize 
being reinstatement.

 No retreats, few regrets, one rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March 13, Michael Carbajal arose from the canvas twice to score a 
seventh-round knockout of Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a battle of light-flyweight champions that scorched the Las Vegas 
Hilton ring and allowed Carbajal to retain his International Boxing Federation 
title and take the World Boxing Council version from Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 5 p.m. Las Vegas-quality fight card today at the Forum that also features 
an attractive grudge match between IBF lightweight champion Freddie Pendleton 
and No. 1 contender Rafael Ruelas of Sylmar, the Carbajal-Gonzalez rematch 
dominates. 
</P>
<P>
 Can this bout, probably Los Angeles' biggest in 15 years, possibly be as good 
as their first? And how does Gonzalez, who controlled most of the fight until 
he was floored by a dramatic Carbajal left hook, avoid another Carbajal crash 
course this time? 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez (37-2, 26 knockouts) blames a poor training regimen for the loss and 
has come into this fight looking trimmer, sounding surer and explaining that 
his mediocre conditioning exposed him in the middle rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 He weighed in Friday night at 107 1/4 pounds, a half-pound lighter than 
Carbajal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I expect another war," Gonzalez said this week. "I expect to win. And 
that's why I've prepared like I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said his strategy of aggressively forcing Carbajal backward worked in 
the first fight, as long as Gonzalez had the energy to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carbajal is a slugger; he's not a boxer," Gonzalez said. "Many people say 
he's a boxer. Maybe he used to be a boxer, but not any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's going to change. I think he is going to come to fight, 
like he did last time. And I personally think he is going to try to do the same 
thing because the last time he won by knockout. If he does the same thing, I 
will win by knockout." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez points to his comeback from a shocking knockout loss to Rolando 
Pascua at the Forum in December 1990. Gonzalez lost the WBC title on that day, 
but regained it six months later by defeating Melchor Cob Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carbajal camp scoffs at Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez will get knocked out this time exactly for the same reasons he was 
knocked out last time, the Carbajals say: Because Carbajal (30-0, 18 KOs) hit 
Gonzalez harder than he hit Carbajal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time anybody loses, they always have an excuse," Carbajal said. "I don't 
pay attention to it. He got tired because I made him get tired -- because we 
were throwing punches from the beginning of the first round. That's why he got 
tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weight problems or not, it doesn't matter, I'm still going to make him get 
tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides said the Forum crowd, expected to be between 12,000 and 14,000, 
generating a California-record gate, will be heavily pro-Gonzalez. Gonzalez is 
a Mexican national who is promoted by the Forum and has had seven of his last 
13 bouts there. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 Carbajal fans from his hometown of Phoenix are expected at the 
Forum, but Gonzalez adviser Rafael Mendoza said he thinks the Forum will be 
"90% for Chiquita." 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs the crowd, I know him," Mendoza said of Gonzalez. "He is better when 
the crowd pushes him." 
</P>
<P>
 But Danny Carbajal, Michael's brother and trainer, said the crowd's roars 
might work against Gonzalez, whose only hope, he claimed, is to stay away from 
his brother's inside power. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if he tries to box and move around and not come in at Michael, his fans 
are going to boo the hell out of him," Danny Carbajal said. "They're going to 
say to him, 'Hey, you're from Mexico, you better get in there.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure is on him. He's going to have to stand and fight. That's to 
Michael's advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 In the featured undercard fight, the 31-year-old Pendleton (35-18-4, 23 KOs) 
is making the second defense of a title he won in early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton, 18-3-1 in his last 22 fights, including a disqualification for 
failing to return to his corner in a non-title bout last December against Ed 
Pollard, has come from Miami talking loudly and carrying a load of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton's first title defense was a decision over Jorge Paez, who had 
earlier been knocked out by Ruelas, and possibly his best losing effort 
occurred when he was decisioned by then-IBF and WBC lightweight champion 
Pernell Whitaker on Feb. 3, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 22-year-old Ruelas (39-1, 31 KOs), this is a contest between his youth 
and considerable punching power, and Pendleton's quickness and savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both weighed in at 135 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the card: Paez (50-6-4, 34 KOs) vs. Andres Sandoval (41-16-1, 36 KOs) 
in a lightweight bout, and Scotty Olson (28-1, 22 KOs) vs. Jorge Roman (15-9-2, 
8 KOs) in a flyweight bout.

<P>
 Every day I wake up thinking Tonya Harding is going to pop out of a hole like 
a groundhog, which means six more weeks of Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya, Tonya, Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
 I came 8,000 miles and nine time zones to watch the Olympics, and I just can't 
write another whole story about this woman today, OK? Maybe tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya, Tonya, Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers even wrote letters to my editor, accusing me of having a crush on her. 
</P>
<P>
 A crush on her? At times I wish an avalanche would crush her. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya, Tonya, Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
 My assignment Friday was her first big photo-op, fire-away, 
hit-me-with-your-best-shot news conference. You know, here I am, Tonya Harding, 
love me, hate me, hold me, thrill me, hallelujah, let's all get happy, we're 
gonna chase all the blues away. 
</P>
<P>
 I went. I took down every word. I heard Tonya's voice, but saw her coach's 
mouth move. I haven't seen ventriloquism like this since Edgar Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a cute act, I'll give them that. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya sits to Diane Rawlinson's right. Ten cents says she can't talk while 
Rawlinson is sipping a glass of water. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like watching a bad beauty pageant. Tonya is 23, but the questions are 
just too, too tough for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya, have you been able to focus on your goal?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been able to focus on my goal because . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Tonya, Tonya, Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya, if you could be any tree . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Nah. Never mind. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's this new bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Any time she's cornered, Tonya now mentions God or country. Which is fine, 
except since everyone first began following Tonya Harding in figure skating, 
the number of times she mentioned God or country before this February came to 
somewhere in the general vicinity of zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, wow. This kid doesn't miss a trick. She's here because she wants 
to win one for the ol' US of A, one nation, under God, indivisible, with 
liberty and justice and it's a grand old flag, it's a high-flying flag. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, the woman sat here Friday and said she's made an arrangement with this 
litter box of a TV show called "Inside Edition" and you know what she said she 
would do with some of the money? Institute a "Tonya Harding Trust Fund for 
Special Olympics in Oregon," said her incredible self, Tonya Harding, bless her 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Any day now, I promise you, this woman is going to adopt a stray Norwegian 
puppy. 
</P>
<P>
 So, enough about her. No more today. 
</P>
<P>
 I have some unfinished business. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Dan Jansen and he has had the longest run of bad luck of anybody 
since David Janssen, the old TV fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the sweetest guy on skates and he has been trying to win one for his 
country for 10 years. His wife wears a little American flag sticker on her 
cheek and his baby daughter bounces on her mommy's knee wearing a bib that 
reads, "Go, Daddy, Go!" 
</P>
<P>
 And he won the 1,000 meters in Olympic speedskating Friday in world-record 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to every race Dan raced in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. Didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to every race Dan raced in Calgary, Canada. Didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to every race Dan raced in Albertville, France. Didn't win. I went to 
Dan's first race in Norway. Didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, I missed Dan's race because I had to go hear what Tonya had to say. 
Tonya, Tonya, Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
 I came 8,000 miles and nine time zones and missed it. 
</P>
<P>
 What I'd like to say is that I love the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 But someone will accuse me of having a crush on him.

LANGSTON SEEKS NEW DEAL BY APRIL; BASEBALL: PITCHER HAS TOLD THE ANGELS HE 
WANTS A CONTRACT EXTENSION BEFORE SEASON OPENS, OR THEY RISK LOSING HIM TO FREE 
AGENCY.

<P>
 The Angels have been notified that they must sign All-Star pitcher Mark 
Langston to a contract extension by opening day or risk losing him to free 
agency when the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first and foremost priority is to stay with the Angels," Langston said, 
"but I'd like to have this resolved by the time we get going (April 5).If it's 
not done by then, I'll just play it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want my contract to be a distraction to myself or my teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi: "I think that's fair. We'd like to 
either get it done by then, or say, 'We've done all that we can do . . .' We're 
definitely interested in doing something." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are expected to resume negotiations next week, and requested a 
meeting with Langston's agent, Arn Tellem. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope is that something will happen early in spring training," Tellem said. 
"I'm cautiously optimistic and hopeful that they realize what he means to the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark is happy here and wants to stay, but if it gets to the beginning of the 
season and nothing's happened, they'll have to wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, in the final year of a five-year, $16-million contract, has a clause 
that prohibits him from being traded without his permission. He rejected trade 
proposals this winter from the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox.

 Gerard Agostinello and his wife have jogged past the intersection in Amity 
Harbor, N.Y., for the past five years. But it wasn't until last Wednesday that 
they looked up at the street signs and made an Olympian discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Look, it's Harding,' " Gerard recalled. "And my wife said, 'Look, 
it's Kerrigan.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan have been doing their best to avoid 
each other at the Winter Games, Harding and Kerrigan roads have been meeting 
for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The street signs are half-buried in a snowbank, but Kerrigan clearly stands 
above Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's hope it goes that way in the Olympics," Agostinello said. 
</P>
<P>
 News at 10: While waiting for Judge Patrick D. Gilroy to emerge from the 
Clackamas County Courthouse, where Tonya Harding and the U.S. Olympic Committee 
reached a settlement last week, two Oregonians on mountain bikes approached a 
reporter, asking if she was still in the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya's not here," the reporter replied. "She didn't bother coming to court, 
just her attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya?" the men asked. "We want to see Connie Chung."

 Trivia time: Who is the only college basketball coach to take four different

 Taxing work: Spy magazine recently calculated how much certain athletes impact 
the price of tickets and merchandise through what it calls a Fabulousness-Added 
Tax. Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
 "Doug Drabek: Earned $1.30 on every $12 Houston Astros ticket in 1993; won 
nine games and lost 18. Also choked away 2-0 lead to Atlanta Braves in ninth 
inning of Game 7 of 1992 National League Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrick Ewing: Earned $6.56 on top New York Knicks ticket in 1992-93; . . . 
usually AWOL during the big games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby Bonilla: Raked in $1.05 on every $15 New York Mets ticket in 1993; led 
team to worst record in majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Jordan: Eked out a meager $1.40 from the low-end ticket and only 
$22.20 from the courtside seat; led the (Chicago Bulls) to three championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne Gretzky: Pocketed from 89 cents to $24.93 a head from L.A. Kings fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Sign of the times: Philadelphia Phillies catcher Darren Daulton, in the first 
year of a four-year, $18.5-million guaranteed contract, might be distracted 
this spring when he is at the plate or behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 Daulton's wife, Lynne Austin-Daulton, has filed for divorce and is seeking a 
"lump-sum alimony" of everything Daulton owns and everything the couple has 
acquired jointly since they were married in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation figures to be on Daulton's mind. A restaurant chain has renewed 
an advertising billboard featuring Lynne Austin-Daulton on the center-field 
fence of the Phillies' training stadium in Clearwater, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kidd is a natural: Michael Jordan won three NBA championships before he 
decided to give baseball a try. California guard Jason Kidd said he won't be 
waiting as long. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, a sophomore, wants to play outfield, catch or be the designated hitter 
for the Bear baseball team when basketball season ends.  
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't for fun," Kidd said. 'I take everything seriously. But I know 
people won't take me seriously . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to play baseball. Baseball comes way before the NBA."

LILLEHAMMER: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; JONES PUTS BRAKES ON ATTEMPT BY SHIMER TO 
REPLACE HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Jones, a former Duke football captain who has been Brian Shimer's pusher 
and brakeman for the last two years, will remain in that capacity when two-man 
bobsled competition begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second of two training runs Thursday, Shimer, dissatisfied with his 
start times this season, had switched to former UCLA football player Jeff 
Woodard, the pusher for driver Randy Will. 
</P>
<P>
 Will was eliminated in a race-off for the two U.S. berths in two-man by Shimer 
and Jim Herberich, leaving Woodard available. Under the federation's selection 
criteria, however, Jones had the right to veto the change and did so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if Brian and the coaches felt a change was in order, we couldn't do it," 
said David Kurtz, assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Did they feel a change was in order? Obviously. Woodard had already been 
registered as Shimer's brakeman and the U.S. federation could only change back 
to Jones if Woodard had an injury. Now, conveniently, he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're calling it a strained quad(riceps)," said Kurtz, who added that Shimer 
has to use Jones in next week's race-off for four-man because Woodard is part 
of Will's crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian has been distracted through all of this because he wanted to assemble 
the best two-man team he can," Kurtz said. "However, he's also putting a 
positive spin on it. He just wants to do the best he can." ROSS NEWHAN

 When Alberto Tomba hits town, you can almost hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old Italian slalom star arrived at the Winter Olympics Thursday, 
accompanied by his usual entourage -- photographers, a personal cook, trainers, 
admirers. 
</P>
<P>
 And one bottle of red wine. Tomba wouldn't say whether it was for a victory 
toast. 
</P>
<P>
 He will try to become the first skier to win a gold medal in three consecutive 
Olympic Games. He won the slalom and giant slalom at Calgary in 1988, and 
repeated in GS in 1992 at Albertville. 
</P>
<P>
 First, though, a little fun. The renegade playboy, known for his fast cars and 
insatiable thirsts, fielded questions here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He revealed that 24 phone messages were awaiting him when he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a sex symbol to do? 
</P>
<P>
 At Calgary, Tomba suggested that Canada rename the province Alberta to 
"Alberto" in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, he suggested the "Albertoville Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 What about Norway? 
</P>
<P>
 "Lille-Tomba," Alberto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan saga, Tomba said: "In Italy, if 
that happened, if someone would hit me, I would just hit back." 
</P>
<P>
 A very nervous, female Japanese reporter, trying to get the jump on the 1998 
Winter Games at Nagano, asked Tomba about the cook who travels with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba responded: "I'll cook spaghetti for you in Nagano." 
</P>
<P>
 In a second of seriousness, Tomba did reaffirm that these would be his last 
Olympics, that he would go to Nagano only as a tourist. Tomba said he has 
become more diligent about his work over the years, and that he will, on 
occasion, look at his three gold medals for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when I feel like winning, I will look at them again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba still has a few days to prepare for his events, Wednesday's giant slalom 
at Hafjell, and the slalom there Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm more serious than I used to be," he said. "I laugh because you 
have to laugh. Otherwise, you don't win." CHRIS DUFRESNE

LILLEHAMMER: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; HOCKEY TEAM TRIES AGAIN FOR VICTORY; HOCKEY: 
SWEDEN'S PUCK-POSSESSION GAME AND STRONG DEFENSE PRESENT A STIFFER CHALLENGE 
THAN U.S. HAS FACED IN THREE TIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Having perfected the art of tying games, the U.S. Olympic hockey team felt no 
need to practice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, Coach Tim Taylor gave his players a day off to spend with friends 
and families. With a game today against Sweden, the tournament's second-seeded 
team and Group B co-leader at 2-0-1, Friday figured to be their last chance to 
relax for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Good fortune, favorable calls and desperation on the power play allowed them 
to rally for ties in their first three games against France, Slovakia and 
Canada. They will need all those factors and more against Sweden, which blends 
playmaking and intelligent defense in a high-paced, dynamic style. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States was 0-1-2 in pre-Olympic play against Sweden, including a 
3-3 tie in their last meeting, Feb. 9 at Goteborg, Sweden. Their most recent 
Olympic encounter was a 3-3 tie at Albertville in 1992. No American team has 
beaten Sweden in the Olympics since a 6-3 victory in 1960 at Squaw Valley. 
Sweden holds a 3-0-2 edge since then. 
</P>
<P>
 "They play a puck-possession game and they also, when they don't have the 
puck, clog up the neutral zone very well and play a strong defensive system 
that all the players are committed to," Taylor said. "You go into this knowing, 
No. 1, offensively you're not going to have the puck a lot and, No. 2, when you 
do have the puck, you're going to be facing a formidable defensive system. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "You try, obviously, to be very good defensively. You go into the game knowing 
Sweden is probably going to have the puck more than we are. We have to have a 
good game plan against their neutral-zone trap. France was actually doing 
something similar to what I think we'll see from Sweden." 
</P>
<P>
 Following Taylor's preordained plan, goaltender Mike Dunham, who started the 
tournament-opening 4-4 tie with France but backed up Garth Snow in the next two 
games, will be back in goal today. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems a curious decision, made by calculation rather than reacting to 
circumstances. Snow, who has five games of NHL experience, played exceptionally 
well against Canada, stopping a penalty shot and blunting a dangerous 
two-on-one chance in the waning minutes. Snow also has been a calming presence 
for the young American team in the last two games, with 59 saves in 65 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor had said before the Games that he might stick with one goalie instead 
of alternating if one became hot, and it's difficult to be hotter than Snow was 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Dunham, who at 21 is three years younger than Snow and lacks his 
teammate's NHL experience, acknowledged he was nervous against France and might 
have played better. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor became defensive when questioned about his choice and said the change 
was not a condemnation of Snow's play, but an expression of confidence in both 
goalies. He cited Dunham's strong past play against Sweden. Dunham saved 64 of 
68 shots in the last two games, a loss to Sweden's B team and the 2-2 tie with 
a squad that will strongly resemble today's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mike is a very capable and confident goaltender and I don't think he 
plays defensively. . . ," Taylor said. "I told you all along we have two 
goalies who are very capable of starting each game."

LILLEHAMMER: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER; JANSEN'S GOLD RUSH 
REDUCES CYNICS TO SOFTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sportswriters are not a particularly disciplined lot. Cynical, yes; 
disciplined, no. But there is one rule they generally follow: No cheering in 
the press box. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was that outburst Friday afternoon among the cynics in the main press 
center here? It sounded remarkably like a cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it sounded remarkably like the cheer that resounded one February 
Friday night in 1980 at Lake Placid, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen years ago, the cheer was for the U.S. hockey team, which had just 
beaten the heavily favored Soviets on its remarkable journey to a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the cheer was for Dan Jansen, who had just completed his own 
remarkable journey to a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, even the no-cheering rule doesn't apply. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever there was a gold-medal kid, it's Jansen. Genuine, down-home friendly, 
the world's best sprinter for the last decade or so, he had won everything 
worth winning in speedskating except an Olympic medal. And his Olympic failures 
had been spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in 1988, when he skated as a tribute to his sister, who had just died of 
leukemia, he fell. In 1992, he skated too cautiously in one race and ran out of 
gas in the other. And Monday, while on a world-record pace, he had bobbled 
again in his specialty, the 500-meter race. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Jansen toed the starting line in Hamar, for the last time in four 
Olympics, the cynics harbored no illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't watch," one said, turning away. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't not watch," said another. "It's like witnessing a car accident." 
</P>
<P>
 "Which corner do you think it will be?" asked the biggest cynic of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Jansen was off, skates flashing, again on a world-record pace. The cynics 
held their breath. When he bobbled again slightly, it happened so fast that 
nobody knew how close to disaster he had come until they showed the replays. 
</P>
<P>
 And only a little more than a minute after he had set off, Jansen roared 
across the finish line, the record and the gold medal his. Finally. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the cheering erupted.  
</P>
<P>
 And later, when Jansen stood teary-eyed on the winner's podium, gold medal 
around his neck, "The Star Spangled Banner" playing, he wasn't the only one who 
was teary-eyed. MIKE KUPPER

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; KARIYA'S ARRIVAL DATE IS FAR FROM CERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Kariya is wearing the red-and-white maple leaf of Canada in the Olympics. 
Question is: What jersey will he be wearing next month? 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, his creative and precise passes will be hitting the sticks of Mighty 
Duck teammates. But what are the chances it will be this season? 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I think they're slim," General Manager Jack Ferreira said before 
leaving for Norway to watch the future of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for Ferreira's pessimism is money. Even though Kariya -- drafted 
No. 4 overall by the Ducks last June -- can't formally negotiate with the Ducks 
or sign with an agent without forfeiting his remaining NCAA eligibility, there 
have been enough philosophical discussions and NHL rumors for Ferreira to know 
the sides are far apart financially. 
</P>
<P>
 The players taken before and after Kariya, No. 3 Chris Gratton of Tampa Bay 
and No. 5 Rob Niedermayer of Florida, both signed contracts with an average 
annual salary in the $800,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question that when Kariya signs he will immediately make more than 
any other Duck -- defenseman Alexei Kasatonov holds that distinction at 
$650,000 a year. Ferreira even said he would match No. 3 pick Gratton's 
four-year, $3.45-million deal in the blink of an eye, but it won't be good 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Kariya can't sign with an agent, he is allowed to consult a family 
legal adviser -- in this case attorney Don Baizley, who represents several NHL 
stars. Though Baizley won't discuss Kariya's value, word in NHL circles is that 
it will take at least a million a year to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that that's what it's going to take," Ferreira said. "It might 
be more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 It helps Kariya that the Hockey News called him the second best player in the 
world playing outside the NHL behind Peter Forsberg -- who just signed a deal 
with the Quebec Nordiques that will pay him about $1.2 million a year (U.S. 
funds). 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't the Ducks just ask Michael Eisner to sweep the loose change off the 
top of his dresser and pay Kariya what it takes? Ferreira said he's committed 
to holding the line on salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important (to try to bring him in this season), but we're not going to 
lose focus of where we ought to be two or three years from now in terms of 
salary structure," Ferreira said, mindful that whatever he pays Kariya, he has 
the No. 2 pick at the draft in June and that player will expect to be paid 
more. "We're not crying poor. But it's important it be the right type of deal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya holds the trump card because he has options. He says he'll wait until 
the Olympics end to consider them, along with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know how very focused he always is. We'll talk when he returns to Canada," 
said his mother, Sharon. 
</P>
<P>
 Maine Coach Shawn Walsh hasn't given up hope that Kariya will return to school 
along with Americans Chris and Peter Ferraro. With those three back, the 
11-14-3 Black Bears would suddenly be contenders to repeat as NCAA Division I 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can offer to Paul is we're here, you can come back and be our captain," 
Walsh said. "He could be back for our road trip March 4 and 5 at New Hampshire 
and Boston College." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya said last fall he might be tempted by the chance to win another NCAA 
title -- or to make a run at the playoffs with the Ducks if they were somehow 
in contention. Surprisingly, the Ducks are closer to the playoffs than Maine is 
to the NCAA title after a tumultuous and injury plagued season in Orono. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other factors. After the Olympics, would he prefer to return the 
familiar surroundings at Maine -- or get a head start on the adjustment to the 
NHL? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Paul would like to start his NHL career fresh -- and he's anything 
but fresh right now," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya also is fond of saying that you can go too early, but he has never 
heard of anyone turning professional too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira thinks those are all peripheral issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a question that he'll come if the dollars are right," 
Ferreira said. "I get every indication if we put the right deal on the table, 
he'll be here right after the Olympics. He's never come out and said he's going 
to go back to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh thinks if the Ducks really want Kariya for their stretch run, they'll be 
able to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's their call," Walsh said. "But he's a sensitive guy. It's tough, 
I've learned not to predict what he'll do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Kariya doesn't join the Ducks until next fall, the Ducks could bring in 
three potential stars at training camp -- Kariya, unsigned 1993 third-round 
pick Valeri Karpov and this year's No. 2 overall pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov -- who is playing for Russia in the Olympics -- didn't reach a contract 
agreement with the Ducks last summer, but his new agent, Jay Grossman, said he 
expects Karpov to sign this summer. The No. 2 pick overall -- if Florida 
doesn't take him first -- could be Radek Bonk, who is playing for Las Vegas of 
the International League at 18. Contracts of 1993's Top Draft Picks

OWNER, DRIVER AND A MEETING OF MIND; AUTO RACING: DARRELL WALTRIP GETS FASTER 
AT THE TRACK HE LOVES TO HATE WHEN HE STOPS BEING A 'GOOD BUDDY' IN THE SHOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been 12 years since Darrell Waltrip won the last of his three Winston 
Cup championships, six years since he won his only Daytona 500 and more than a 
year since he won a Winston Cup race anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned 47 two weeks ago and has been in 21 Daytona 500s in a row -- more 
consecutive starts than any other driver in Sunday's field. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does he think of his chances? 
</P>
<P>
 "I firmly believe that this is the best team I've ever had, even including the 
ones in years when I won 12 races," he said. "We (had the sixth-fastest car) 
but ran into some bad luck Thursday when the Hoosier tires didn't do the job 
the way we thought they would. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be back on Goodyears for Sunday's race, and I expect to be back where 
we were when we had the best winter I'd ever had testing at Daytona and 
Talladega (in Alabama)." 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran driver from Franklin, Tenn., was speaking as both owner and driver 
of the gleaming No. 17 Western Auto Chevrolet Lumina he will start in 32nd 
position in Sunday's race. "My rule of thumb at Daytona has been if I qualify 
well, I run well," Waltrip said. "I qualified well, but I didn't run well 
Thursday. But I know why and we've taken care of the problem. I don't see any 
problem in running from where we start. It just means getting through more 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when Waltrip won the 500, he had qualified second. But there is 
precedent for winning from as far back as Waltrip will start. Bobby Allison won 
from 33rd in 1978 and Benny Parsons from 32nd in 1975. More recently, Bill 
Elliott started 38th and won the Firecracker 400 at Daytona in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Waltrip also finished second in 1979 and third three years in a row from 
1984-86. He has also won five Twin 125 heat races, five Busch Grand Nationals, 
one IROC and one Busch Clash at Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell the truth, I have a love-hate relationship with Daytona," Waltrip 
said. "I love to win here, but I hate the price I've had to pay. Of all the 
tracks I've been to in my racing career, none holds a light to Daytona (in) the 
bodily harm it's done to me through the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The accidents seem to run in cycles. From '83 to '89, I had some pretty good 
luck here. Then, from '90 on, it's been a battle." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he formed his own Winston Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he was involved in accidents during both the Daytona 500 and the 
Goody's 300 Grand National, then had the worst accident of his career during 
the 1991 Firecracker 400 in July when his car was destroyed when it flipped 
across the wet infield grass. Waltrip sustained a black eye and multiple 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 When he left Rick Hendrick's team to form his own, most NASCAR observers shook 
their heads in dismay. Other drivers, notably Bobby Allison, Buddy Baker, Cale 
Yarborough and even Richard Petty, had tried to run owner-driver teams and all 
had failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had been a stigma that you couldn't do both successfully, but I think 
that was more because all of them were underfinanced," Waltrip explained. 
"Sponsors were leery of backing them, but when we got Western Auto behind us, I 
felt we were ready for big things." 
</P>
<P>
 Big things happened for a while -- he won two races in 1991 and three in '92, 
including the Southern 500 at Darlington, S.C. -- but 1993 was a loser. He not 
only didn't win, he had only two finishes as high as third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was a major learning year for the owner," he said. "When things 
started going sour, I began to doubt my ability as a driver, but friends, even 
racing competitors, told me the problem was with the owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally got it through my head that I was operating my team on the 'good 
buddy syndrome.' When I was not at the shop, performance dropped. When I was 
there, things were OK, but I couldn't be around all the time. The answer was to 
clean house, get a new guy (Clyde Booth, who had been with Kenny Bernstein's 
team) to run the shop and get tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Waltrip also sold his Grand National, ARCA and All-Pro cars to concentrate on 
one thing -- regaining his Winston Cup success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny how different the driver mentality is from the owner mentality," 
he said. "I should have learned from running for Junior (Johnson) and Rick 
(Hendrick) that when you try to run two teams, instead of ending up with one 
great team, you more likely end up with two mediocre ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just aren't enough hours in a day to do both and do them right." 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors sometimes mentioned as contributing to Waltrip's slump have been 
age, a growing family and the inability to say no to outside commercial 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Waltrip's responses: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On age: "Sure, I have to think about it. I'm no fool. I know I have to work 
harder to compete with guys 25 to 35. I used to be that age myself, and I know 
how I felt, but I think the way I work out, I'm as fit physically as ever. It 
just means more time from the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was younger, 40 seemed like an age to retire. I was winning races and 
winning championships, but the pressure on me to win made it very difficult for 
me. I never thought I could take it for 20 years. I was always battling 
something -- race politics, my car owners, other drivers, the media, the fans. 
It was something all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, I woke up to realize I couldn't win every race, that I couldn't 
worry about the ones I didn't win. It didn't make losing any easier, but it put 
it in a different perspective. That's when I knew I could keep doing this for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On his family -- wife Stevie and daughters Jessica, 7, and Sarah, 1 1/2: 
"My family is the kind you long to work for. It gives me more focus, but it's 
easy for a race driver -- and a race car owner -- to fill his time working to 
make the car better. What I have to do is be sure they get from me what they 
need. That, and a lot of love, which is the easiest to give." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On off-track activity: "I'm the first to admit I like to be out in front. 
It's part of my personality, but there is a limit to how many balls you can 
keep in the air. I hate to say no to an opportunity. . . . There are so many 
more opportunities now than there were a few years ago. Somewhere, you have to 
turn some down, but that's a whole lot better alternative than not having any 
offers." 
</P>
<P>
 An added emotional burden this week for every driver is the memory of Neil 
Bonnett and Rodney Orr, who were killed in accidents during practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wake up in the morning with a knot in my stomach and a heavy heart, and I 
go around all day feeling like that," Waltrip said. "You can't get away from 
it. No one here can. The worst part is when you're off the track. You have more 
time to reflect on it. Your mind thinks of all the 'what ifs?' and there's 
nothing you can do."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; STRAWBERRY SAYS HE'S READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry, talking to reporters on the opening day of training camp at 
Vero Beach, Fla., looked up to see a group of players from Japan's Waseda 
University approaching the batting cages. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's my new team," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the controversy surrounding Strawberry off the field, there has 
been speculation that the Dodgers might try to trade him this spring. But Fred 
Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said Friday that if Strawberry is 
productive, he will stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he hits 20 home runs or more and drives in 100 runs or more, I'm not 
willing to let that pass," Claire said. "I have nothing but positive thoughts 
about it. He has worked hard, he is swinging well and he is highly motivated. 
If he isn't motivated now, I don't know when he would be." 
</P>
<P>
 There remain some unresolved issues that could affect Strawberry, including an 
ongoing investigation by the IRS of allegedly non-reported income from baseball 
card shows. But Claire said he is not expecting bad news, although he is 
willing to react to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry said he is physically sound and would like to finish his career in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Ramon Martinez was the only no-show, and Claire wasn't happy about it. 
When he found out that Martinez wasn't here, he called the club's baseball 
academy in the Dominican Republic and discovered him there, preparing to pitch 
in an intrasquad game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he felt fine and was in a good frame of mind, which is better than 
what I was in," Claire said. "I told him I was glad he felt good, but I thought 
it would be in his best interest if he were here feeling good." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who hadn't bothered to tell the club he wasn't coming, told Claire 
he had some personal business to handle and would arrive Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott, who had 25 saves and a 2.32 earned-run average while filling in for 
closer Todd Worrell last season, came to camp ready to challenge for the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is the team, but I think it is ridiculous that the subject 
hasn't been brought up," Gott said. "I love that job, and in three of my 10 
years I have proved I can do it. I think it's a nice problem for (Manager) Tom 
(Lasorda) to have." 
</P>
<P>
 The job, though, is Worrell's to lose, Lasorda said. MARYANN HUDSON

TRACK AND FIELD; INDOOR MEET IS ON THE MARK DESPITE DROPOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sunkist Invitational indoor track meet, first rocked on Jan. 17 by the 
Northridge earthquake and battered again this week by two big-name dropouts, 
nonetheless will make its 35th go-around at the Sports Arena today. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Al Franken lost perhaps his best race Thursday when Olympic champion 
sprinter Gail Devers withdrew from the 50-meter race after being told that 
Russian sensation Irina Privalova had been added to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Franken said Devers' representatives wanted more appearance money than the 
agreed-to $9,000 to run against Privalova, which Devers' coach, Bob Kersee, 
didn't deny. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Franken lost miler Steve Scott. Still the American mile record-holder, 
Scott called in sick with flu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very rough go this year," Franken said of the meet he has 
promoted since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sports Arena was closed for 10 days for earthquake inspection, right 
after we'd started promoting the meet, and that certainly didn't help advance 
ticket sales. They even closed the box office." 
</P>
<P>
 For several days, before it was known whether the Sports Arena would be 
available, Franken secured alternate dates at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion and at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Franken said he hopes that Devers will reconsider and run against Privalova, 
and he plans to hold Devers' lane assignment open until race time, 7:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring more dropouts, these should be tonight's spotlighted events: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The women's 880, where Maria Mutola of Mozambique will chase Mary Decker 
Slaney's 14-year-old meet record of 1:59.7. Mutola ran a 2:02.85 half-mile in 
this meet last year and later won the indoor and outdoor world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The women's 50-meter hurdles, where Jackie Joyner-Kersee, two-time Olympic 
heptathlon champion, will face two athletes ranked among the top five U.S. 
hurdlers, Marsha Guialdo and Dawn Bowles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The decathlon hurdles and long jump, where 1993 world champion Dan O'Brien 
will begin his drive to a hoped-for 9,000-point decathlon later this year. He 
holds the world record of 8,891.  
</P>
<P>
 -- The featured miler will be Marcus O'Sullivan of Ireland, who has history's 
third-fastest indoor mile, 3:50.84, and three indoor world 1,500-meter 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The men's shotput, where Randy Barnes, outdoor (75-10 1/4) and indoor (74-4 
1/2) world record-holder, towers over the field.  
</P>
<P>
 The first event for about 1,500 high school athletes will be held at 11 a.m. 
and the meet will continue throughout the afternoon. Open competition starts at 
6 p.m. with the pole vault, and the first running event is set for 7:05 p.m.; 
the final race, the mile, starts at 9:55.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The team has been notified that it must sign All-Star pitcher Mark Langston to 
a contract extension by opening day or risk losing him to free agency at 
season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first and foremost priority is to stay with the Angels," Langston said 
Friday, "but I'd like to have this resolved by the time we get going (on April 
5). If it's not done by then, I'll just play it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi: "I think that's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston is in the final year of a five-year, $16-million deal. BOB

JUDGE OVERTURNS BAN ON HORSEMEN'S LOBBYING

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Robert O'Brien of the Los Angeles Superior Court has overturned a 
California Horse Racing Board order that would have limited the ability of the 
California Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn. to lobby public officials 
on issues affecting its membership. 
</P>
<P>
 At its last monthly meeting, the CHRB issued an order limiting the amount that 
could be spent on lobbying to 5% of the CHBPA's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Judge O'Brien's decision is good news, we have little time to revel in 
our victory," CHBPA President Chris Clark said in a prepared statement Friday. 
"Our political voice has been silenced since last November and, now that the 
judge has ruled in our favor, we need to quickly press on with our legislative 
agenda." BOB MIESZERSKI

SANTA ANITA; BENGAL BAY GIVES HIS NEW OWNERS MONEY'S WORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans of Bengal Bay shouldn't fret if they miss him in the $109,800 El Conejo 
Handicap today at Santa Anita. They may get a chance to see him again Monday in 
the $200,000 San Luis Obispo Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Barry Abrams, who has kept Bengal Bay busy since claiming him for 
$12,500 on Nov. 3, will run the son of Woodman in the 5 1/2-furlong El Conejo 
this afternoon after entering him this morning in the 1 1/2-mile San Luis 
Obispo on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Bengal Bay, who ran seven times in one 56-day period, competes in both 
races depends on a couple of factors. "We'll see how he comes out of the (El 
Conejo), but we won't run in the San Luis Obispo if Bien Bien runs," said 
Abrams, a former standardbred trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Bien Bien doesn't run, the field, except for Fanmore, isn't that strong. 
Most of them are $100,000 claimers in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Abrams' brother, David, and Vic Johnson, Bengal Bay has already 
proved to be a bargain buy. After winning only one of his first nine starts in 
1993 for owner 505 Farms and trainer Mark MacDonald, Bengal Bay has won three 
of seven for Abrams and earned $81,975 while moving up the claiming ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 In his most recent appearance, he beat $100,000 claimers by six lengths, six 
days after beating allowance horses by 1 1/4 lengths at 6 1/2 furlongs on the 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Running with minimal rest hasn't bothered the former $425,000 yearling 
purchase. He made his first three starts for Abrams in a span of nine days. 
After finishing fourth on Dec. 11 and Dec. 15, he won against $32,000 claimers 
on Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thrives on racing," said Abrams, who went out on his own with 
thoroughbreds last summer after serving as Roger Stein's assistant for nearly 
three years. "When he ran three times in nine days, his third race was the best 
of the three." 
</P>
<P>
 Highly regarded before his debut, Bengal Bay had basically been a bust through 
the first 16 races of his career and had worked his way down to the $12,500 
level, one step from the bottom at Santa Anita, when Abrams claimed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race when he broke his maiden (on Nov. 15, 1992) stuck in my mind," 
Abrams said. "He won going seven (furlongs by nearly two lengths in 1:21 3/5) 
and he showed the same burst of speed he did when he won the $100,000 claimer 
(on Feb. 5). 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure what I had, because he ran fourth the day I claimed him. 
Physically, he seemed OK, but he had some back problems. We worked with him, 
his back got looser and looser and he got more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 The late-running Bengal Bay is the co-sixth choice at 8-1 in the eight-horse 
El Conejo, which will mark his stakes debut. The 3-1 favorite is Scherando, 
third in the Palos Verdes Handicap behind Concept Win and J.F. Williams, who 
will skip this race, in his last start. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse can run any distance on any track," Abrams said. "That's the great 
thing about him. I wouldn't trade horses with anybody in this race. He's won 
three times in the last two months, and nobody else in there has won (since 
Nov. 27). 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse hasn't run to his best yet. I don't know how good he is. He's got 
the breeding and the class to be any kind of horse."

RAM NOTEBOOK / MIKE REILLEY; RAMS INTERESTED IN QUARTERBACK MITCHELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams have expressed interest in free-agent quarterback Scott Mitchell, 
although there has been no indication they are ready for serious contract 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the Rams have kicked the tires," said Tony Agnone, Mitchell's 
Maryland-based agent. "They have called me to inquire about him." 
</P>
<P>
 With quarterback Jim Everett on the trading block, the team has been 
interested in free agents such as Mitchell, who was with Miami last year, and 
Atlanta's Chris Miller. The team also could explore a trade for Indianapolis' 
Jeff George or Houston's Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warren grew up in Los Angeles and has roots here," said Leigh Steinberg, the 
Newport Beach-based agent for Moon and George, "so Anaheim is definitely an 
attractive place. But Houston has not privately told us they're ready to trade 
him. They would like to keep both quarterbacks (Moon and backup Cody Carlson)." 
</P>
<P>
 But can the Oilers foot the bill? Moon, 37, and Carlson, 30, make a combined 
$6.25 million a year, and the Oilers might have to trade one of them to free 
money under the new $33.8-million salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've read a lot of speculation," he said. "But Warren and Cody together don't 
make what Troy Aikman makes. They make right about what Steve Young makes. So 
it's not only possible, but probable, that Houston could keep both players." 
</P>
<P>
 George, 26, has grown unhappy while languishing in the Colts' offense the last 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are among 11 teams that have inquired about Mitchell, who became an 
unrestricted free agent when his contract with the Dolphins expired Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, 26, replaced the injured Dan Marino as the Dolphins' starting 
quarterback last season and finished as the AFC's fourth-ranked quarterback, 
completing 133 of 233 passes (57.1%) for 1,773 yards, 12 touchdowns and eight 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott's looking for a strong defense and a strong running game to keep him 
competitive," Agnone said. "He's interested in the offensive line situation and 
certainly who the offensive coordinator is." 
</P>
<P>
 Agnone said it was "still too early to tell" if Mitchell would visit the Rams' 
practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox, who's handling the quarterback acquisition, was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add free agency: The Rams have secured the right of first refusal on 
restricted free-agent linebacker Roman Phifer by extending him a $649,000 
qualifying offer sheet. The offer sheet was the minimum to guarantee the Rams a 
first-round draft pick as compensation if another team signs Phifer. Otherwise, 
the Rams would receive a second-round pick as compensation, the round Phifer 
was taken in the 1991 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Injury update: Ram wide receiver Todd Kinchen, the team's punt return 
specialist, underwent a second operation on his injured left knee this month. 
Kinchen underwent reconstructive knee surgery in November to repair ligament 
damage he suffered in a game against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The second operation, arthroscopic surgery, was done in early February to 
smooth a rough edge on some bone in his knee. He is expected to return to the 
team in July or August, just after the start of training camp, Ram trainer Jim 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram tight end Pat Carter, an unrestricted free agent, underwent arthroscopic 
surgery on his knee and shoulder last week. Both were routine surgeries.

GANGSTA RAP ACCOUNTABILITY'S A MUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am saddened that Maxine Waters, who has consistently defended the rights of 
women, now chooses to defend a subculture that depends on violence and hatred 
of women for much of its appeal ("Rap Finds a Supporter in Rep. Maxine Waters," 
Feb. 15). 
</P>
<P>
 It's absurd to claim, as Waters does, that male rappers should be forgiven for 
their misogyny because "it's part of the culture."Negative stereotypes of 
African Americans, in characters such as Amos 'n' Andy, Stepin Fetchit and Aunt 
Jemima, were very popular in this country at one time (so were lynchings and 
Jim Crow laws). That hardly makes them defensible. 
</P>
<P>
 Speech is a political act, with implications far beyond the utterance of the 
words themselves. Creating a musical subculture that denigrates half the human 
race is a political decision. Its creators as well as its defenders should be 
held accountable for their choices.

REGIONAL BOWLING CENTERS TRYING TO PICK UP SPARES; RECOVERY: ALLEYS THAT 
SURVIVED QUAKE OPEN THEIR DOORS TO DISPLACED LEAGUES UNTIL OTHER FACILITIES CAN 
BE REPAIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As an independent owner of an area bowling alley, Bill Mossontte grapples 
daily with an industry giant: the Brunswick Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunswick owns four bowling centers in the Valley, Mossontte one. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most competitive markets in the United States -- the San 
Fernando Valley -- for bowling," Mossontte said. "League bowlers are valuable 
entities. You're always trying to add league bowlers. I'm extremely competitive 
with Brunswick." 
</P>
<P>
 In the month since the Jan. 17 earthquake rocked this area, Mossontte has 
welcomed Brunswick league bowlers by the hundreds to his Mission Hills Bowl. 
But Mossontte is not robbing Brunswick of business. Instead, he has rushed to 
his competitor's aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will take their bowlers here and send them back when their houses are ready 
to reopen," he said. "This is a time to help each other out." 
</P>
<P>
 Few area lanes escaped damage from the 6.8 temblor, and four of the 13 in the 
San Fernando, Simi and Santa Clarita valleys remain closed. A fifth -- 
Brunswick Valley Bowl in Simi Valley -- reopened Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunswick Granada Lanes and Corbin Bowl in Woodland Hills have so much damage 
they might never reopen. Rocket Bowl in Chatsworth won't reopen until early 
March after repairs and remodeling. Brunswick Matador Bowl in Northridge won't 
reopen until at least September, and the future of Granada Lanes hinges on a 
lease that expires in 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Brunswick's four lanes in the area, only Bowlerland Lanes in Van Nuys 
stayed open after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mess," said Warren Flanigan, regional vice president of Brunswick. 
"There's a lot of shuffling going on. I don't think the dust will settle for 
quite some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanigan estimates damage at three Brunswick locations at nearly $1.3 million. 
In addition, Brunswick is losing business. An estimated 2,000 league bowlers 
are either out of action or bowling elsewhere. Flanigan has been forced to 
cancel some leagues that were scheduled to run through May. 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger fear is that the Valley might become another San Bernardino. 
According to Flanigan, nearly two-thirds of that city's league players stopped 
competing last year when two bowling alleys closed. When it comes to the 
livelihood of their sport, the Valley's bowling proprietors -- fierce 
competitors that they are -- stand in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 Mossontte already has one of the busiest league schedules in the area, but he 
has taken in more than 350 daytime bowlers from Brunswick venues and reduced 
their fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see them bowl -- for the industry," Mossontte said. "Otherwise, 
the industry suffers. They quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Mossontte is not the only bowling proprietor to step forward. Bowlerland has 
brought in 10 leagues and an estimated 500 bowlers from Matador and Granada. 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park Bowl is now home to two leagues each from Matador and Granada, 
representing an additional 300 bowlers. Canoga Park has become the temporary 
home to nearly 700 displaced bowlers, including those from 12 Corbin Bowl 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodlake Bowl in Woodland Hills has accommodated nearly 200 bowlers from 
Corbin and Rocket Bowl. And Rocket Bowl, even though it is shut down, has 
promised to accommodate outside leagues without a temporary venue as soon as it 
reopens next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel closer to the competition," said Mike Willis, bowling manager 
at Canoga Park Bowl. "There's a working-together feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from league players, recreational bowlers face even greater 
inconveniences. Most of the nine operating centers in the area have filled what 
used to be open-bowling time with displaced leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mission Hills Bowl, for instance, the only slot for recreational bowling 
Monday through Thursday is from noon to 2:30 p.m. Open play at Canoga Park is 
not available until after 11:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 p.m. Sunday. 
Saturday is open all day, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest obstacle in the aftermath of the earthquake is restoring the four 
bowling alleys that remain closed. Most of them have cracked beams and 
partially collapsed roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 Matador Bowl likely has sustained more than $1 million in damage, Flanigan 
said. The south wall was removed because it was unstable. Rain has warped the 
lanes and rusted the pin-setting machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might just write it off as a loss and rebuild it," Flanigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage at Simi Valley, estimated at $250,000, was primarily superficial. 
Granada Lanes suffered the least damage ($20,000-$30,000), but it has provided 
Brunswick with its biggest headache. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos has been discovered in the cracked ceiling and must be removed. 
Flanigan claims that all repairs at Granada Lanes are the responsibility of the 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't appear they are working too hard on it," he said. "That doesn't 
mean we won't reopen. But maybe the landlord is trying to tell us he doesn't 
want us there." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanigan also said Brunswick has been looking for a new site in the Valley in 
case Granada Lanes' lease is not renewed later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The lounge, restaurant and video game room are open at Corbin Bowl, but no 
repairs will be made to damage in the bowling alley, said owner Allen Shaw, 
until an accurate cost figure is determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said his lease could be dissolved and he could be forced to close if 
repair expenses exceed 25% of the estimated cost to build a new structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely (interested in) repairing this business," Shaw said. "We were 
probably one of the hottest open bowling centers. I could have this reopened in 
a matter of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he spent about $500,000 upgrading the facility a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Rocket Bowl suffered partial lane damage, the venue must be sanctioned 
anew for league play once repairs are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket Bowl manager Donna Adamek said the $400,000 cost to reopen the center 
covers not only repairs but some much-needed refurbishing. For that, the timing 
of the earthquake was ironic. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Adamek, "We had OKd a remodel job the day before."

DIGEST: NORDHOFF KICKER LEACH SIGNS TO PLAY FOR DELAWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nordhoff High kicker Sean Leach has signed a letter of intent with Delaware, 
after he said the Fightin Blue Hens' coaching staff promised to make him the 
No. 1 kicker and punter next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach drew interest from Notre Dame, Syracuse, Oregon, Kansas State and 
several lower division schools.Washington invited him to walk on next fall. But 
Delaware was the only school to offer a full scholarship to Leach, named to the 
all-state medium schools division team by Cal-Hi Sports. USA Today ranked him 
second in the country among punters. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach said the Fighting Irish told him he was their No. 1 choice but later 
opted to "stick with Brian Ford." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, who will be a sophomore next season, was given a scholarship by the 
Irish after he transferred from Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach made seven of 11 field-goal attempts, 33 of 37 extra points and had a 
44.7-yard punting average, including a 77-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the people and the campus at Delaware," Leach said. "It's a good 
atmosphere. Plus, they promised me I would punt and kick for four years, where 
at Notre Dame I'd always have to compete for a job." DANA HADDAD

SLAUGHTER IN PARADISE: YACHT MURDERS HAUNT ANTIGUA; CARIBBEAN: FOR MANY ON 
TOURISM-DEPENDENT ISLAND, THE FRIGHTENING ASPECT OF THE SLAYINGS IS FINANCIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This has not been a good season for a place that bills itself as a Caribbean 
oasis where guests pay as much as $1,700 a day for sun and tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 For their money, tourists seeking refuge from London damp and Manhattan snow 
instead got rain nearly every day this week, along with clouds that hid the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there were the murders, what some here are calling "slaughter in 
paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain will stop and the clouds will blow away," Alan Jeyes, hotel owner 
and yachtsman, said of the unusual bad weather. "But the killings -- I'm afraid 
they're going to be a blight for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The killings: On Jan. 29, four people, two originally from California, were 
found dead on a richly appointed 65-foot, two-masted yacht as it lay at anchor 
just off an isolated beach of the neighboring island of Barbuda. 
</P>
<P>
 Police announced Friday that they had arrested an unidentified 22-year-old 
Barbudan and that two other men were being sought in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Supt. Michael Lawrence from London's Scotland Yard said the apparent 
motive for the killing was robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether solved or not, the murders -- the victims were bound, gagged and shot 
execution-style -- are the first multiple killings in Antigua's history. 
</P>
<P>
 They have stunned and frightened this tiny Caribbean nation, which lives 
almost totally on the money spent by the 500,000 upscale tourists who come 
every year -- most of them at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 There is much to be frightened about. As with nearly all of the minuscule 
island nations left behind by European colonial masters, Antigua is nearly 
totally dependent on the whims of tourists, mostly from the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 70% of Antigua's gross domestic product, the measure of the country's 
economic wealth, comes directly from tourism and provides the population with 
one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean.  
</P>
<P>
 Since most of the islands offer the same thing -- warm weather in the winter 
months of North America and Europe, blue water and fine sand beaches -- 
Antiguans seek a competitive edge in other, intangible ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than go for offering high-volume cheap tours or low prices as do some, 
or easy sex and gambling as do others, Antigua lures guests with some of the 
best harbors in the world and assurances of exclusivity. 
</P>
<P>
 While some other Caribbean islands contend with racial tensions between local 
dark-skinned have-nots and visiting white haves, Antigua boasts of friendly 
citizens who always smile when they say "hello" and "thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure that there is little to offend, there are few long-haired 
backpackers; facilities are fancy and prices too high. 
</P>
<P>
 Few working-class people or couples with large packs of little children come 
to vacation where tourist guides list hotels in the $300-per-person per-day 
range as "moderate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Above all, what we offer is a beach for every day" says Tourism Minister 
Rodney Williams, referring to Antigua's 365 beaches, "sun and tranquillity -- 
and that includes safety." 
</P>
<P>
 So the brutal deaths of two wealthy tourists and what initially seemed to be 
slow and clumsy police work have put everyone on edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday's announcement, the investigation had been confusing, full of 
contradictory and often erroneous police statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of thing that could send them (the tourists) all off to 
Anguilla," says Alberto Ravenello, owner of an expensive Italian restaurant, 
referring to a rival resort island that also caters to the very wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Commented one New Jersey executive who was spending $800 a night for a month's 
stay at the Curtain Bluff resort, where the clientele is mainly elderly and 
white and where the men wear coats and ties each night for dinner: 
</P>
<P>
 "I come here every year because it is safe and I don't have to worry about 
feeling guilty or being threatened because I want to live well. If I can't have 
peace of mind and the lifestyle I want, if I can't go sailing or out to dinner 
at night without worrying about it, then there are many other places to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antigua is nice, but I don't owe it anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he added: "I think these killings were a one-time thing; at least, I 
expect so, and I'm planning on coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 The executive might not be so casual if he knew that Antigua is in the middle 
of what appears to be a crime wave, at least in local terms. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not Los Angeles or Miami -- or even Grand Island, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year there were five murders in this nation of 60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last two months, the head of Antiguan Customs was killed in 
circumstances so mysterious that the detectives from Scotland Yard were called 
in to help the investigation. A prominent shopkeeper was murdered. Then came 
the four on the yacht. And on Feb. 14, an unidentified man was killed, some say 
by the police in shady circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to mention at least two robberies of visitors golfing on one of 
Antigua's most exclusive courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these crimes have been kept from the public. The radio and television 
stations are owned or controlled by the government, as are the 
large-circulation newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the government and the resort owners) don't want people to know," said 
Tim Hector, Antigua's most prominent political dissident and publisher of the 
independent weekly newspaper, the Outlet. "So they suppress all the bad news." 
</P>
<P>
 Or else they blame it on immigrants from nearby islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "All them killings, them golf robberies," claimed tourist guide Denley Henley, 
were done by Jamaican Rastafarians, "or Dominicans." 
</P>
<P>
 But the yacht murders have been too big to keep under wraps, particularly 
because the victims were from very sensitive groups: rich tourists and the 
sailing community. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were William Clever, 58, his wife, Kathleen, 50, the yacht's 
33-year-old captain, Ian Cridland, and crewman Tom Williams, 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clevers, Americans from the Sacramento area, had lived abroad for a 
quarter of a century, sailing the world and operating a yacht-chartering 
service in France before moving to Britain. Clever's last job was as an 
executive in a company developing an estate on one of the Channel Islands in 
the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cridland and Williams were British, although they spent much of the time 
in this southern Antiguan port village, one of the premier sailing centers in 
the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 The million-dollar-plus yacht they were sailing, the Computacenter Challenger, 
is owned by Peter Ogden, Clever's boss in the estate development company and 
owner of one of Britain's largest computer dealerships, Computacenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clevers were taking a sailing vacation on the yacht as a gift from Ogden, 
friends here said. 
</P>
<P>
 They and the two crewmen were well known in the bars and wealthy resorts and 
restaurants that dot the pink sandy beaches of Antigua and Barbuda. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of Friday's arrest, little is known or being admitted about what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Theories, speculation and rumors -- lots of rumors -- are still making the 
rounds: The crew was running drugs. The boat was being used to carry drugs 
without anyone on board knowing. The four victims were silenced because they 
saw an airplane drop drugs that were picked up by another boat. And -- the 
theory possibly borne out by Friday's arrest -- just plain robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 This much is known: According to police and residents, the Computacenter 
Challenger left Nelson's Dockyard, a national park used as a marina by some of 
the world's largest and fanciest boats, on Jan. 29. They were to be gone six 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Mysteriously, at least in the minds of several dockyard regulars, one or 
perhaps two other scheduled guests failed to make the sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days later, a passing sailor noticed the Computacenter Challenger sitting 
at anchor in 20 feet of water at Low Bay, one of the many lonely and unoccupied 
beaches of Barbuda. Low Bay is about 15 miles from Antigua but close to a 
resort that boasts a $1,700-a-day suite. 
</P>
<P>
 His curiosity piqued by the location -- a boat as large as the Computacenter 
Challenger should have been in deeper water -- and by the yacht's open hatches, 
the passer-by clambered on board. 
</P>
<P>
 What he found was horrible. Four badly decomposed bodies, the men in 
undershorts, Kathleen Clever in a night shirt, were lying on the floor of the 
main cabin. Their hands had been tied behind their backs, their mouths gagged 
with duct tape. Police theorize that they had been sitting at a table when they 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 That is about as definite as the police have been. Even in announcing the 
arrest, Lawrence, one of seven Scotland Yard detectives working on the case, 
provided no more details about the actual murders. 
</P>
<P>
 And the investigation itself appeared sketchy, at best. 
</P>
<P>
 The first report from police said the four people had been stabbed and 
mutilated. That prompted talk that the four had been tortured before being 
killed, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
 A later autopsy showed they had all been shot, Clever in the back and side, 
his wife once in the back, Cridland in the chest and Williams in the head and 
back. There were no stab wounds, no mutilations. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining exactly what happened was hampered when Antiguan police sailed the 
yacht to the capital, St. John's, without securing the scene of the killings. 
When the boat arrived after plowing through rough seas, the bodies and other 
evidence had been tossed about. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the island speculation centers on a connection to the drug trade in 
the eastern Caribbean, where both British and American narcotics experts say 
Colombian cocaine dealers have been increasingly active. 
</P>
<P>
 These experts say there is no evidence that the boat had been used in running 
drugs or that the Clevers and the crewmen had any involvement in the drug 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector, the dissident and newspaper publisher who has good sources in the 
government and with the police, said one likely scenario was that the four 
witnessed a drug transaction and were killed to keep them silent. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug experts say the most prevalent narcotic transaction involves 
airplanes dropping bales of cocaine into the seas near Antigua, where 
black-painted speedboats known as stealth boats recover them, passing them over 
to larger mother ships or smuggling them into nearby poorly policed ports. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could happen to any of us," said Judy Harrison, an American bartender 
who has lived here for 15 years. "We all see things that are strange. It really 
makes me nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Ravenello, the wife of restaurant owner Alberto, feels the same way.  
</P>
<P>
 "Today we saw a strange ship sail into a harbor where no one ever goes," she 
said. "I got out of there in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the arrest, Antigua's police commissioner, Edric Potter, and 
Detective Supt. Michael Williamson, another of the Scotland Yard officers, said 
they had always discounted the drug connection as well as speculation about a 
sex crime or a business deal gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked from the start on the theory that it was robbery," Potter said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said investigators found some travelers checks and cigars that were 
traced back to the yacht, as well as some other items that he declined to 
identify, which were buried on the beach near the yacht's anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
 However, questions remain. Williamson would not comment, but other sources 
said large amounts of valuable jewelry were left on board and wallets were 
found containing money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," said Jeyes, the hotelier, when contacted after the arrest 
announcement. "If it were a robbery, why was so much stuff left on the boat? It 
is still very, very unsettling."

COLUMN ONE; CULTURE: A RUSSIAN TRAGEDY; ARTISTS ARE REELING FROM SOVIET-ERA 
DEVASTATION. THEY ARE CONFUSED BY THEIR NEW FREEDOM AND CRIPPLED BY THE 
WITHDRAWAL OF STATE SUBSIDIES. BUT A NEW AND UNPREDICTABLE GENERATION IS SLOWLY 
BLOOMING.

<P>
 The good news for culture fans on the Aeroflot flight here from Moscow is that 
the flight attendants hawk books rather than projecting cinematic tripe. The 
bad news is that the only books they offered recently were a British 
bodice-ripper and a tome of home-grown soft-core porn called "The Lascivious 
Priest." 
</P>
<P>
 This in the country that gave the world Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov -- and on 
the way to what Russia calls its "Cultural Capital." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Petersburg still floats in a lofty atmosphere of art and literature, from 
the classical columns of the pastel palaces lining its canals to the quotes 
from Pushkin that the locals drop into their conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, creators and critics say, Russian culture, for all its past and 
potential greatness, is still reeling from Soviet-era devastation. 
Paradoxically, with the fall of the Soviet regime, it also finds itself 
confused by its new freedom and crippled by the withdrawal of state subsidies. 
Only slowly, haltingly, is it feeling its way forward to some possible, 
unpredictable new blooming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russian culture is truly a great culture because it has made global 
achievements in art, literature and music, (in) painting, the Russian 
avant-garde . . . ," said Dmitri Likhachev, an 87-year-old literary historian 
who is to culture here what Andrei D. Sakharov was to human rights, an 
irreproachable figure of moral authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russian culture can't go from great to small," said Likhachev, seated in his 
high-ceilinged office beneath portraits of Pushkin, Lermontov and Turgenev. 
"But real Russian culture can be crushed -- if the libraries are destroyed and 
if there is general illiteracy." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is just the direction that the country is heading in, many Russians 
worry aloud. Government budgets that supported whole stables of ideologically 
correct writers, artists and performers have shrunk to pitiful sums. Much of 
the country's creative elite, even as it condemns the horrible damage that 
Soviet-era repression did by silencing, exiling, imprisoning and even killing 
nonconformists, is now wringing its hands at the ruthlessness of the raw 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the outburst of creativity that many expected when the Soviet 
regime collapsed, many writers and artists find themselves floundering. Some 
who opposed the regime lack inspiration now that they have nothing to fight, 
and many who supported it long for the cultural force-feeding and comfortable 
life of the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become common for Soviet-era literati to lament that Russian high 
culture is dying. Filmmaker Stanislav Govorukhin's complaint is typical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia reads nothing any longer. . . ," he groused recently. "Right before 
our eyes, it is turning into a spiritless and intensely immoral country. Where 
can the people and the nation find their spiritual strength if not from 
culture, literature, theater and art? From where?" 
</P>
<P>
 Poet Andrei Dementyev complained in the daily Moscow Times that poetry 
readings once packed sports stadiums, theaters overflowed and literary journals 
sold millions of copies. But now, he wrote, "Our life is full of pornography, 
worries about the future . . . conversations about the fantastic prices and 
meager salaries." 
</P>
<P>
 These ominous assessments, however, draw little sympathy from St. Petersburg's 
leading cultural lights. They feel no trace of nostalgia for communism's 
70-year ideological stranglehold on culture. 
</P>
<P>
 As literary historian Alexander Panchenko put it: "Soviet power tried to make 
everyone go to the ballet, and it didn't work. Now we're seeing that it didn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet power did far worse than that. 
</P>
<P>
 In its early days, it not only muzzled many of the best Russian talents, it 
killed them in camps or prisons or Siberian exile -- as in the cases of poet 
Osip Mandelstam and theater director Vsevolod Meyerhold. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, it drove many into foreign exile, among them writers Alexander I. 
Solzhenitsyn, and Joseph Brodsky, cellist-conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, 
dancers Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov and sculptor Ernst Neizvestny. 
</P>
<P>
 "The human or the social or the biological race that produced great writers 
was stamped out of existence in all the period of purges and atrocities," said 
Nikita Tolstoy, a physicist and arts enthusiast whose father, Alexei Tolstoy, 
was a distant relative of the great Leo Tolstoy and one of Russia's best-loved 
writers; Nikita's daughter, Tatyana Tolstaya, is now becoming just as popular 
an author. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tolstoys are a happy exception. More typically, artists and musicians 
bemoan the loss of whole generations of the cream of Russian culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuri Temirkanov, head of St. Petersburg's main orchestra, said that for the 
last 20 years he has watched his best musicians and instructors leave, whether 
for greater artistic freedom or simply for softer living. 
</P>
<P>
 "An orchestra is like a living organism," he said. "It needs to be in touch 
with its progenitors. . . . Youth has to study with somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 The visual arts, too, face a generation gap. Artist Sergei Kovalsky, director 
of an entire building of creative squatters -- from performance artists to jazz 
groups -- at 10 Pushkin St. in St. Petersburg, noted that there is no Russian 
museum of contemporary art. There is nowhere for young artists to see how 
Russian artists who spurned the government-imposed style of socialist realism 
-- lots of tractors and happy proletarians -- used to paint in the underground, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't know (pioneering Abstract artists Kasimir) Malevich or (Wassily) 
Kandinsky if they hadn't left in time," Kovalsky said. "This gap between the 
generations is the worst -- it brings a lot of harm to culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet regime left a more subtly damaging legacy as well. In its 
repressiveness, it made underground heroes of those willing to defy it. And 
that, ironically, is creating problems for the heroes themselves, who tend to 
feel lost without anything to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Boris Grebenshikov, the revered leader of the veteran St. Petersburg rock 
group Aquarium, recalled that back when rock was persecuted, his late and 
legendary colleague, Viktor Tsoy, once commented about another musician: "He's 
beating his head against the wall. What's he going to do when he finds himself 
standing in a field?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Grebenshikov said, "They have to learn to live without an enemy, and 
that's the hardest task." 
</P>
<P>
 Several artists and writers, when asked to define the general mood these days 
of Russia's creative cadres, used the word " rasteryannost " -- perplexity, 
confusion, with a tinge of losing one's head. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, "when lyrics were banned, you had to write about the future, 
when everything would be possible," said St. Petersburg poet Tatiana Voltskaya. 
"Now, there's nothing to write, nothing to say. It's very tragic. The 
underground has felt it, and even the official poets like (Yevgeny) 
Yevtushenko. Now they look like dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
 In the theater world, top directors compensate for the current paucity of 
powerful new dramas by returning to the classics. The recent theater sensations 
this month were the premiere of a Rimsky-Korsakov opera "The Invisible City of 
Kitezh" in St. Petersburg's Marinsky -- formerly Kirov -- Theater, and the 
innovative staging of Chekhov's "The Sea Gull" in Moscow's Taganka Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But rehashing the classics does little to diminish a sense of disappointment 
that Russians sense from many Westerners who, impressed by the talent that has 
emigrated, have been waiting for great things from Russia since the Iron 
Curtain was lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Avant-garde composer Sergei Kuryokhin says he has been confronted at European 
festivals by disappointed music hounds with a now-familiar tune: "The borders 
have been open for a few years now. Where's the greatness? We want something 
fresh and bright and something new to the West. Where is it? Why isn't it 
happening?" 
</P>
<P>
 Part of why it is not happening, critics and artists say, is the horrendous 
financial plight of most of Russian culture. The Russian government continues 
to pay subsidies, but the amounts are a mere fraction of what the Soviet system 
used to give those it favored. Nor, in a market economy, can the arts keep pace 
with inflation and its impact on consumers of culture.  
</P>
<P>
 Kovalsky used to have to worry about secret police raids and harassment; now, 
he said, "The hard part is different -- it's survival in the market, because 
there is no art market in Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Temirkanov said his orchestra, in order to pay its musicians decent salaries, 
must spend as much time as possible on tour abroad, generally playing endless 
quantities of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff.  
</P>
<P>
 "We play the same thing year to year, which is of course very bad for the 
orchestra," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the St. Petersburg Conservatory, Russia's oldest music academy, 
administrators say they have barely enough money to pay the gas bill, and local 
newspapers have warned that the building is in such poor repair that it could 
come crashing down on the heads of practicing students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian Culture Fund, the leading foundation meant to foster hundreds of 
cultural programs across the country, used to enjoy the support of Raisa 
Gorbachev. Now it has less than $100,000 in its coffers, according to its head, 
movie director Nikita Mikhalkov. It is not helped by Russia's confused tax 
code, which does little to encourage contributions to charity and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is absolutely monstrous," Mikhalkov said in Moscow. "It's 
monstrous because culture is seen as an appendage that will return by itself 
when the people are fed and clothed and shoed. . . . (But) culture is the 
mother of the people, and if we lose it and the people are left orphaned, we 
will not be forgiven." 
</P>
<P>
 If freedom has condemned St. Petersburg's Philharmonic to endless Tchaikovsky, 
it has brought a new kind of silence to "Leningrad," the literary journal that 
dictator Josef Stalin banned in 1946 after Communist officials decided they did 
not approve of such 20th-Century literary greats as poet Anna Akhmatova and 
satirist Mikhail Zoshchenko. 
</P>
<P>
 Renamed "St. Petersburg," the journal has put out one hefty edition that 
included an absorbing surreal short story, memoirs, poetry and essays. But that 
will probably be it, Editor in Chief Nikolai Kreshchuk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Government support for the journal is gone, and the patron company that helped 
to pay for the first edition has decided to invest in endeavors that could 
bring more return, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of "St. Petersburg" is typical of much of the publishing industry, 
which is hard-put to print serious literature in the face of high paper costs 
and the public hunger for formerly unobtainable romances, science fiction and 
thrillers.  
</P>
<P>
 Complaints about the death of Russian culture come most loudly from among the 
thousands of "official writers" who lost the soft life of hefty royalties, 
prestige, cheap vacations and special shops that membership in the Soviet 
Writers' Union used to bring.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were all these pseudo-writer, pseudo-artists who all served the regime, 
and now they're the ones who are crying that culture has died," Moscow literary 
critic Benedict Sarnov said. In his view, it is Soviet -- not Russian -- 
culture that is dying, and good riddance. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, slowly but surely, the Russian reader is getting acquainted with 
all the thinkers and authors long forbidden to them, from Freud to Russian 
philosopher Nikolai Berdiayev.  
</P>
<P>
 "It looks ugly, but it's a healthy process," Sarnov said of the publishing 
crisis. "In culture, freedom is a higher value than finances." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Kreshchuk of "St. Petersburg" is philosophical rather than bitter. 
Real literature "shouldn't count on the public. Writers are naturally like 
marathoners without an audience."  
</P>
<P>
 The works of the 1960s that caused a sensation by daring to hint at problems 
in the Workers' Paradise may have faded, but a new generation of Russian 
writers is rising, Kreshchuk believes, authors of about 30 who are so truly 
free that freedom is not an issue for them. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, he said, Soviet-Russian literature was carried away by themes 
centered on the hypocritical lives of the Communist elite or the 
Solzhenitsyn-style horrors of life in prison or in a military construction 
battalion. The new generation, he said, will be different. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might have maybe some religious problems and life experience in some 
little village and also have real high culture -- and with that, a new 
literature is being formed," he said. "That's a normal mix, a rich mix, that 
was impossible before." 
</P>
<P>
 Panchenko, the literary historian, sees a new emphasis on style as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Russian writing, he said, might look like this: "A young man meets a 
girl, he falls in love with her, she falls in love with him, they get married 
and have a lot of kids and die -- but all just very well executed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian music world already appears to be living up to their predictions 
in its own way. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest club band in Russia these days appears to be Dva Samaliota -- 
meaning Two Airplanes -- an African-sounding group guaranteed to get audiences 
on their feet. It has gone to the opposite extreme from the underground 
poet-bards of the Soviet era -- eschewing words altogether and singing in a 
gibberish that its vocalist used to claim was Swahili. 
</P>
<P>
 Grebenshikov, the revered rock artist whose spiritual, subtle lyrics are 
considered by many to be the best poetry around today, said of Dva Samaliota: 
"Unfortunately, they absolutely don't have any substance. They're some kind of 
a big joke." 
</P>
<P>
 The joke, however, is full of released energy -- a happy energy almost never 
found in Russia in the old days.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like this fresh stream," said the group's manager, Arkady Volk. "The 
'Planes send their energy into the hall and create a holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 Kovalsky's colony of squatter artists at 10 Pushkinskaya is also a testament 
to the energy of young Russian artists. Known as "the epicenter of the 
avant-garde," its walls are covered with poetic graffiti and it serves as 
frequent host to '60s-style happenings, art shows and concerts. St. Petersburg 
authorities are trying to kick the squatters out, but they show impressive 
determination to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 And for all his worries about the fate of Russia's libraries, museums and 
theaters, Dmitri Likhachev too says he lives in anticipation of the next wave 
of Russian creation -- perhaps something to rival the literary boom of the late 
19th Century or the Silver Age of poets and artists in the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
 It will come, he thinks, from the Russian provinces, and from some of the 
young people who, instead of turning to vandalism, spend their time putting 
together collections of poetry.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have great hope for when they grow up," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He has much to be proud of now, also, he said -- from the solidly good writing 
of Fazil Iskander, a warmly humorous novelist who some think deserves the Nobel 
Prize, to Alfred Schnittke, considered Russia's leading contemporary composer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, Likhachev and others appear to pin their hopes on the mystery of 
the Russian character, which, no matter what changes it undergoes, appears 
simply to need culture and art more deeply than its Western counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 In America, "Culture is what adds beauty to life," composer Kuryokhin said. 
"But for us in Russia, it's what gives life its point."

HAITI'S EXILED LEADER TO TURN UP HEAT ON U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, concluding that the Clinton 
Administration is backing away from his bid to regain power, plans a series of 
steps to pressure Washington into taking stronger action against the military 
rulers of the impoverished Caribbean nation, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The ousted president may soon call on his supporters in Haiti to set sail for 
the U.S. mainland in a flotilla of small boats, to embarrass the Administration 
and challenge its refugee policy, say the sources, who are close to Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say that Aristide may call on African American leaders to exert more 
public and private pressure on President Clinton. And as a third step, Aristide 
may urge France or Canada to take over the U.S. leadership role in trying to 
force the Haitian military to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's camp concedes that the strategy is born of desperation. But after 
allowing the Administration to set the agenda for the past year, Aristide has 
concluded that his best chance for regaining power may lie in making such a 
nuisance of himself that the United States will throw its full weight behind 
his bid to return to Port-au-Prince -- if only to get him out of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 There can be no doubt that the Administration already is weary of Aristide, a 
populist Roman Catholic priest who in December, 1990, won an overwhelming 
victory in Haiti's only democratic presidential election. He was deposed by the 
military in a bloody coup less than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry complained that Aristide was unwilling 
to explore compromises that could permit him to regain at least some of his 
lost power. Asked whether he was accusing Aristide of intransigence, McCurry 
said: "That's close to our reading, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration wants Aristide to endorse a plan put forward by eight 
members of Haiti's Parliament. It calls on the exiled president to name a new 
prime minister, who would form a coalition government. Once the new government 
was established, Aristide would return to Haiti and reclaim the presidency -- 
although he would have to share power with the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide flatly rejected the plan, maintaining that it does not guarantee he 
would ever regain his lost office. A similar proposal last fall failed when Lt. 
Gen. Raoul Cedras, the army commander, and other military leaders refused to 
keep their promise to step down and the U.S. government did not try to enforce 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's supporters say trying the same approach again would be pointless, 
especially without any sort of commitment from the United States to pressure 
the military into keeping its side of the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide and the Haitian Parliament members met for four hours Thursday. 
Afterward, Aristide said his position was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's supporters also fear that if a prime minister is named before 
Aristide regains power, the military might compromise with the prime minister 
to create the appearance of democracy while freezing out the deposed president. 
Although Aristide enjoys the fanatical support of the island's impoverished 
majority, he is hated and feared by the military command and by the wealthy 
civilian elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's trump card in his relationship with the United States is the 
refugee issue. 
</P>
<P>
 After Aristide was deposed, Haitians who feared political repression began 
trying to flee to the United States in small boats. Shortly after Clinton took 
office last year, Aristide -- encouraged by the President's support of renewed 
efforts to restore democracy to the island nation -- urged Haiti's poor to 
remain at home. He also tacitly approved the Administration's policy of 
intercepting Haitian boat people on the high seas and sending them back. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, Aristide broke with the Administration and criticized it 
for returning the refugees. Now, the sources say, he is considering going much 
further by urging Haitians to flee the island. Such a step could create a flood 
of refugees that would deeply embarrass the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the Congressional Black Caucus and some other African American 
leaders -- joined by white liberals on Capitol Hill and a group of artists and 
celebrities -- have been urging the Administration to take stronger action to 
restore Aristide. Now, Aristide strategists say, the exiled president is ready 
to urge those groups to be far more forceful. That move could be troublesome 
for Clinton because the groups are potentially important segments of his 
political base. 
</P>
<P>
 As if on cue, 40 members of the House of Representatives, led by Rep. Joseph 
P. Kennedy (D-Mass.), on Friday called on the Administration to urge the U.N. 
Security Council to impose an economic embargo on Haiti to force the military 
to allow Aristide to return. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, France, Canada and Venezuela are circulating a draft of 
such a resolution at the United Nations but have not yet introduced it.

U.S. WARY OF RUSSIA OFFER TO BOSNIA; BALKANS: MOSCOW'S PROPOSAL TO SEND 400 
TROOPS TO SARAJEVO GETS MIXED RESPONSE. SOME SAY THEIR PRESENCE COULD 
COMPLICATE ANY NATO DECISION ON AIR STRIKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With two days left before a deadline for allied air strikes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Clinton Administration gave a mixed response Friday to 
Moscow's proposal to move Russian troops there, publicly welcoming the 
initiative but privately expressing concern about the possible effect on 
efforts to end the siege of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Administration officials publicly sought to put a good face on Russia's 
offer to Bosnian Serbs on Thursday to redeploy 400 peacekeepers to Sarajevo if 
the rebels would comply with NATO's demand that they relocate or surrender 
their heavy weapons around the city or face air bombardments. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid signs that the Serbs were continuing to pull back some artillery Friday, 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry told reporters he was "cautiously, 
cautiously optimistic about the developments. . . . We among other nations have 
been requesting the Russians to assist in whatever way they can do to help the 
Serbs comply with the NATO directive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In private, however, some U.S. officials conceded that they were apprehensive 
about any new Russian military presence, particularly about whether Moscow 
might use its troops to bolster U.N. and Western goals in Bosnia or would seek 
to protect Serb interests. The presence of troops from Russia -- the Serbs' 
historic patron -- near Bosnian Serb artillery sites could complicate any North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization decision on the bombing of those targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow's move, which caught the Administration by surprise, raised the 
possibility that Russia could become an unpredictable major player in an 
already tangled and many-sided Bosnian conflict. The United States and other 
allied nations scrambled on diplomatic fronts Friday to determine Moscow's 
objectives and plans, but answers remained murky. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect the Russians will be under U.N operational control," a senior 
Administration official said. But the official stopped short of saying that the 
Russians had committed to follow the lead of the U.N. commander, and signals on 
this point from Moscow were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian peacekeepers could reach Sarajevo within two days, once the United 
Nations grants a request from Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin to transfer 
them there from their current base in Croatia, reported the Itar-Tass news 
agency, which said Yeltsin had made such a request. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, U.S. officials contended that the surprise move by Moscow 
was helping the allied cause by sending a clear signal to the Bosnian Serbs 
that they would have to withdraw or turn over control of their artillery 
outside Sarajevo by the deadline of 1 a.m. local time Monday (4 p.m. PST 
Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
 "We will try to withdraw all of our weapons by 2400 tomorrow (midnight 
today)," Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said after meeting with the 
United Nations' top official for the former Yugoslav federation, Yasushi 
Akashi. That would beat by a day the NATO deadline for the heavy guns to be 
withdrawn or put under U.N. supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also stressed that the Russians, like the Americans, have the most 
to gain from a peaceful settlement of the crisis in the Bosnian capital because 
it would allow the two nations to avoid being drawn into positions that would 
drive a wedge into their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton is to make a televised address to the nation shortly after 7 
a.m. PST today to explain the reasons for the threatened air strikes and to 
describe how far the Bosnian Serbs have gone in removing their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian withdrawal began in earnest on Thursday and continued on Friday, 
although not as rapidly as some planners had wished. Under U.N. rules, the 
Serbs must either pull their artillery back to positions 12 miles outside 
Sarajevo or place it under U.N. control. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, in an apparent effort to spur further action from the Bosnian 
Serbs, stressed that NATO intended to follow through on its threats if the 
terms are not fully met. "The decision was a decision and a deadline is a 
deadline," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the Serbs had removed at least 50 
heavy weapons and were continuing to take them out. U.S. officials have 
estimated the Serbs have at least 200, and possibly as many as 500, heavy 
weapons around Sarajevo.  
</P>
<P>
 "It means they have a lot more to take out (before the deadline)," Christopher 
said in a CNN interview. "They will pay a very heavy price if they don't do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is keeping a low public profile on the question of what the 
Russians might do in Bosnia, to avoid pushing Moscow into a corner politically 
for fear that nationalist pressures at home could propel them to support the 
Serbs more aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, said a new Russian presence would "add a complicating factor." But 
he added that because of Russia's influence with the Serbs, "on balance, it's 
positive." Hamilton said Russia's proposal also demonstrated a more aggressive 
foreign policy "that we've already been seeing in other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former U.S. official now with the Brookings Institution, 
predicted that the Russians "are going to want to be sort of lawyers for the 
Serbs." With their role hard to guess now, "it isn't going to be easy to deal 
with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian troops already have been criticized elsewhere in the former Yugoslav 
federation, Sonnenfeldt noted. Some that were supposedly under U.N. control in 
Croatia have been accused of allowing the removal of arms from Croatian 
warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's top national security advisers met for two hours Friday to discuss 
the Bosnian situation and other issues but announced no major new actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry is scheduled to fly to Aviano air base in Italy late today for a 
last-minute meeting with NATO defense ministers to reaffirm the allies' 
intentions. A U.S. official said the group "will leave no doubt that" the 
allies plan to enforce the NATO withdrawal order. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-country organization has hundreds of planes on aircraft carriers and at 
bases in Italy ready to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply with the War Powers Act, Clinton sent Congress a letter Friday 
explaining his actions in Bosnia. The letter noted that NATO's orders not only 
give it authority to strike artillery positions, but also the flexibility to 
hit Serbian air defenses threatening NATO aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also points out that "it is not now possible to determine the 
length of these operations." 
</P>
<P>
 As U.S. officials were giving credit to Clinton for the progress in Sarajevo, 
the Kremlin's diplomatic point man on Yugoslavia, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaly Churkin, was praising Russia for persuading the Serbs to pull back. 
</P>
<P>
 Churkin, speaking in Moscow, noted with pride that "Russia is now playing a 
central role" in the peacemaking attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, Yeltsin sent letters to Clinton and the leaders of France, 
Britain, Italy and Germany expressing concern that air strikes in Bosnia could 
lead to "unpredictable events" and possibly a broader war. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Italian newspaper La Stampa, the letter spoke of worries "not 
only in Russia but in all the world" that NATO wants "to pursue designs of 
dominance." 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, a spokesman said Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali "is delighted" at the Russian offer to move 400 of its 
peacekeeping troops from Croatia to Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sills, the spokesman, described the offer as a response to a request for 
help made to many governments by Lt. Gen. Michael Rose of Britain, the U.N. 
commander in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Carey Goldberg in Moscow and Art Pine, Norman Kempster, 
Doyle McManus and Stanley Meisler in Washington contributed to this report.

WITH RUSH OVER, QUESTIONS ARISE ON EARTHQUAKE RELIEF; HOUSING: SOME PRAISE 
SWIFT RESPONSE. BUT OFFICIALS WONDER IF IT MEANS SHIFT IN GOALS OF DISASTER 
ASSISTANCE.

 Touring Los Angeles the day after the Northridge quake, U.S. Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development Henry G. Cisneros was moved by the thousands of 
people pouring into outdoor encampments and feared the prospect of a new 
category of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are poor people with no connections," Cisneros said. "We have to help 
them. . . . We'll just keep plugging until we have a way." 
</P>
<P>
 Just 24 hours later, HUD officials said they had a way. The department 
announced an unprecedented package of emergency housing assistance that will 
pay most of the rent for displaced, low-income quake victims for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand has been enormous, and the program has been praised by many as an 
example of President Clinton's strong commitment to the recovery effort. But as 
the hectic rush of early relief efforts gives way to cooler reflection on the 
most expensive disaster relief effort in U.S. history, the housing subsidies 
are posing important questions about the nature, goals and limits of disaster 
relief efforts, according to key legislators, Capitol Hill analysts and housing 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the hastily developed HUD program essential to emergency relief efforts? 
Was the traditional Federal Emergency Management Agency housing assistance 
program incapable of meeting Los Angeles' needs? Why guarantee 18 months of 
rent payments? What will happen to tenants when the voucher subsidies run out? 
Were controls adequate to discourage abuse and duplication and ensure the aid 
went to deserving victims? 
</P>
<P>
 It is too early to know how the Los Angeles housing voucher program will be 
judged, but its relatively generous terms may have helped bring an 
unintentional, ironic shift in disaster assistance policy. Championed by one of 
the highest-ranking Latinos in the Clinton Administration, the housing vouchers 
gave added ammunition to those criticizing public assistance for illegal 
immigrants, Capitol Hill sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It focused a number of senators on that (immigrant) issue," said Sen. Harry 
M. Reid (D-Nev.), who helped draft a precedent-setting amendment to the 
$8.6-billion quake aid bill that denies assistance of more than 90 days to 
undocumented residents. Others argue that the issue would have erupted 
regardless of what relief agencies did because of an anti-immigrant climate in 
California and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD officials say the housing voucher program is needed, has adequate controls 
and strikes the proper balance. "Did we provide immediate relief and a sense 
that government was responsive? Are we offering a program that will help 
low-income people?" said Joseph Shuldiner, HUD's assistant secretary for 
housing. "The answer is yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) applauded Cisneros for initiating 
the voucher program, which had never been used in an emergency. "It was very 
positive, if not courageous . . . knowing he could be subject to criticism," 
she said. But the subsidies warrant close review, said Roybal-Allard, who is a 
member of the House subcommittee that monitors federal housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is our obligation and where does that stop? Do we put people in housing 
that they later can't afford? Is this money going to encourage people to . . . 
be lazy and not work and take advantage of the system? This has to be very 
carefully monitored." 
</P>
<P>
 As with reports of rampant fraud in the free-flowing, post-quake food stamp 
program, and disclosures that FEMA mailed checks to people who had not sought 
assistance, the housing vouchers highlight the conflicting pressures on 
government officials in the wake of a major disaster. If people are not quickly 
rehoused and aid is not swiftly disbursed, officials risk criticism from the 
public, politicians and the media that the needy are going unserved. But 
opening the relief tap too wide can lead to waste, abuse, scandal and 
legislative second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, FEMA's emergency housing grants, given in two-month increments to 
renters and three-month increments to homeowners, are supposed to meet the 
needs of disaster victims. The grants, typically $1,100 per month for 
Northridge earthquake victims, are given without regard to income, although 
inspectors are supposed to confirm the applicant's residence was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA's grant can be extended up to 18 months if a continuing need for 
assistance is demonstrated. FEMA grants are paid to victims, who may spend them 
as they wish on replacement housing or to repair a damaged residence. 
</P>
<P>
 The new vouchers, which are intended exclusively for low-income households, 
were needed, HUD officials said, so poor quake victims could compete for 
suitable replacement units. They note that affordable apartments are scarce in 
Los Angeles, and the supply of older, multiunit apartments was diminished by 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD has budgeted $200 million for the vouchers, which guarantee a landlord 
rent for 18 months. The tenants pay 30% of their income to the landlord and the 
government pays the remaining rent, which can total 90% or more of the monthly 
payment. In many cases, that has allowed quake victims to move into apartments 
they could not have afforded before the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The longer term of the voucher and the direct government payments to landlords 
make low-income apartment hunters more appealing to building owners, housing 
officials say. "No one is going to rent to them" if they only have a guarantee 
of two months' rent, HUD's Shuldiner said. "The reality is that the (FEMA 
grant) would have very little value" to low-income quake victims struggling to 
find housing.  
</P>
<P>
 But some key legislators are not fully convinced. Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los 
Angeles) said it is not clear to him that shorter-term housing assistance, such 
as FEMA's, would not have been more suitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not clear it has been studied through," said Dixon, a member of a special 
House committee, created in the wake of budget battles over the Los Angeles aid 
package, that will review disaster relief programs. "I never envisioned any of 
these programs going beyond the period necessary to find permanent housing or 
move these people back into their original housing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake marked the first time HUD housing vouchers were offered 
immediately in the federal disaster assistance centers. The intent was to 
quickly move poorer applicants directly into longer-term housing. But the 
program has not moved as briskly as officials had initially hoped. It has taken 
many applicants weeks to get an appointment to apply for a voucher, then find a 
suitable unit and complete a process of HUD inspections and rent negotiations 
with landlords. As of late this week, nearly 17,000 tentative vouchers had been 
approved, but less than 2,400 recipients had been given final approval to move 
into new units. 
</P>
<P>
 There also have been concerns about the basis on which the HUD vouchers were 
being distributed, particularly in the beginning. Housing officials have relied 
heavily on computer reports compiled by Los Angeles city building inspectors to 
verify that an applicant's building was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 But building officials note that their inspections were cursory and not 
necessarily reliable for decisions on disbursement of long-term housing grants. 
"These (reports) were not intended for that purpose," said Nick Delli Quadri, a 
spokesman for the Building and Safety Department. "(They) were basically 
intended to develop a statistical analysis of damage . . .things were very 
rough. It was not intended to look at each building point by point and say this 
building is not good and that one is good." 
</P>
<P>
 Housing officials said there was no fast, feasible alternative. "It was the 
best there was," said Gary Squier, general manager of the Los Angeles city 
housing department. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also unclear how many landlords will be willing to accept the vouchers. 
Some have expressed reservations about getting involved in a government 
assistance program, and there have been reports of voucher-holders having 
difficulty finding units. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros convened a meeting with the building owners last week to encourage 
more to accept the vouchers. "Obviously, if we had known what we know today . . 
. we would have done the outreach (to landlords) from the beginning," Shuldiner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, critics warn that the emergency housing vouchers could become a 
costly permanent form of housing assistance in Southern California. "They'll 
come in (in 18 months) and we'll have to renew the damn things," said one GOP 
analyst on the House Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Dade County, Fla., are seeking just such a renewal for HUD 
housing vouchers offered to victims of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Far smaller in 
scope, the Florida vouchers were offered two months after the hurricane. And 
the vouchers, good for two years, went to a different mix of applicants, 
including some who had lived in federally subsidized housing units before the 
hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, with the first batch of vouchers scheduled to expire later this 
year, Dade County officials report that most recipients still can't afford 
adequate housing and are at risk of losing their shelters if the relief program 
is not extended.  
</P>
<P>
 HUD and local housing officials say they hope to minimize such problems here. 
Recipients will be reminded in writing that their subsidies will only last 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe a significant number of the people will not need the program more 
than 18 months," Shuldiner said. "They were making it (on their own) 
beforehand. They do have an ability to get jobs. They will get their act 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say any effort to extend the vouchers would be unfair to tens of 
thousands of needy families in Los Angeles County who have been waiting for 
such federal housing assistance for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Comerio, a UC Berkeley associate professor and expert on disaster housing 
issues, says it is far from clear the 18-month vouchers represented the best 
use of HUD's $200 million. "It doesn't address the underlying supply of 
affordable housing, and it sets people up to delay their real housing choices," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 18 months the world (for low-income renters) isn't going to look a whole 
lot different than it does right now. It's seriously time for the federal 
government to think about a disaster housing policy . . . instead of having a 
kind of knee-jerk reaction in response to each disaster," Comerio said.

A 'WORN OUT' NOLAN RESIGNS, GETS 33 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS and MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Pat Nolan pleaded guilty in federal district court Friday to 
racketeering and was immediately sentenced to 33 months in prison. His sentence 
begins March 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the onetime GOP Assembly leader was unapologetic and said he had 
only pleaded guilty because he feared a lengthier prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "For six years I have battled (federal prosecutors)," Nolan, of Glendale, said 
outside the courthouse. "I'm worn out, though I think I would have convinced a 
jury of my innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, a one-sentence resignation letter from Nolan was the first 
order of business in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators greeted the resignation with a mixture of sympathy and 
indignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said: "I assume you plead guilty because you are 
guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 But the San Francisco Democrat also expressed concern for his onetime 
political rival: "It's always sad when something happens to one of my members. 
. . . This is obviously the worst of the horrors." 
</P>
<P>
 In pleading guilty, Nolan became the first Republican legislator and the first 
member of the Assembly to be convicted as part of an eight-year federal 
political corruption investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Charles J. Stevens, who signed off on Nolan's plea-bargain 
agreement, said the assemblyman's imprisonment would serve as a warning to 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the incarceration of influential legislators such as Nolan will 
chill to the bones any legislator who would even consider linking votes with 
money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In court before U.S. District Judge Edward J. Garcia, a subdued Nolan declined 
to make a statement, but outside the courthouse, speaking to a throng of 
reporters, he complained about the unpredictability of juries and said that if 
he had been convicted of even one of the six counts included in the grand jury 
indictment against him, he might have faced an 8-year, 4-month prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 "That risk was one I am not willing to take," he said, his voice filled with 
emotion. "But my family is too important to me so I've accepted the 
government's offer, which will limit my time away from them as they grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan, 43, and his wife, Gail, have three children -- all under 6 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now have a great appreciation of what Chief Joseph (the defeated 
19th-Century Nez Perce leader) felt when he said, 'I will fight no more.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker Brown and other legislators acknowledged that the latest guilty plea 
in the federal corruption investigation tarnishes the Legislature's image. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles) put it more bluntly: "It is 
a black eye for the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Nolan's Assembly colleagues said they had taken the former Assembly 
Republican leader at his word when he professed his innocence and vowed to 
fight his case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 All but one of the Republicans in the Assembly had endorsed his bid for 
reelection, according to Assemblyman Paul V. Horcher (R-Diamond Bar), who said 
he was the lone holdout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat Nolan and I had a different view on ethics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan's attorney, Ephraim Margolin, defended his client as an honorable person 
with torn allegiances. 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasized that Nolan had refused to cooperate with authorities in the 
prosecution of other public officials in the government's continuing efforts to 
root out corruption in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 He described Nolan's legal dilemma as a choice of loyalties, between his 
family and his Republican allies. 
</P>
<P>
 "So in the final account, the man who never took one penny for himself in this 
affair, who was perhaps too aggressively loyal to his party, decided to take 
his medicine and get it over with," Margolin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sworn statement filed with the court, Nolan described conducting his 
Assembly office as "a racketeering enterprise" for extorting campaign 
contributions from those who sought his support on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted working in collusion with his former legislative aide, Karin 
Watson, to extort a $10,000 campaign contribution from the Marriott Corp. in 
1988 in return for his vote. At issue was a bill that would have helped a rival 
company, Sunrise Development, build a luxury resort in the city of Indian 
Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the money, Nolan said, he voted against the so-called desert 
wars bill, "which was the position Marriott wanted me to take." 
</P>
<P>
 No charges have been filed against Marriott, which had a competing development 
in nearby Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan also admitted accepting in the same year two $5,000 checks from 
undercover FBI agents, who were posing as Southern businessmen as part of an 
elaborate federal sting operation. The agents were seeking Nolan's support for 
a bill that would help their bogus company, Peachstate Capital, build a shrimp 
processing plant near Sacramento. Nolan said he accepted the checks at a 
meeting in a hotel room across from the Capitol. Watson pleaded guilty to 
extortion in 1989 and was expected to be a crucial witness against Nolan and 
two other defendants in a trial still set to begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Those defendants, Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) and former legislative aide 
Terry E. Frost, say they will continue to fight the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were charged with being part of a conspiracy with Nolan and Watson.  
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who was close to Nolan politically when the two served in the Assembly, 
expressed sympathy for Nolan and his young family, but added: "I don't 
understand all the pressures he was under." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill and Frost had asked to be tried separately from Nolan. Now, in effect, 
their wish has been granted, with Nolan dropped from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to get away from Nolan," said Frost's attorney, Christopher H. 
Wing, who argued that the charges against the Republican legislator would hurt 
the other defendants. "This is good news for us in the long run. If Hill would 
get out of there, then we could try this case (against Frost) on the merits and 
not on the publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost said he was glad for another reason as well. With Nolan as a 
co-defendant, he said, the trial could have run an additional seven weeks and 
cost him an extra $70,000 in attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan was named in six of the eight counts in the grand jury indictment issued 
in April; Hill in two, and Frost in one. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the plea bargain, prosecutors dismissed all other charges 
against Nolan, which originally included conspiracy, extortion and money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said that if he were convicted on all charges, Nolan could have 
faced a sentence of more than eight years. Judge Garcia said that the 
agreed-upon 33-month sentence, on the low end of federal sentencing guidelines, 
nevertheless assured proper punishment and rehabilitation. He also fined Nolan 
$10,000 and gave him three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Stevens said that Nolan will not be required to testify for the 
prosecution against Hill and Frost. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan remains free without bail until reporting to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The guilty plea and resignation close the door on what was once a promising 
political career. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan, a lawyer and USC graduate, was first elected to the Assembly in 1978 -- 
one of a crop of so-called Proposition 13 babies who ran for office while 
supporting that landmark property tax-cutting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Glib and ambitious, Nolan formed a rebellious group of insurgent 
conservatives, who in six years were able to take control of the GOP Assembly 
caucus -- with Nolan named as its leader. Under his leadership, the Republicans 
came within a handful of seats of taking control of the Assembly, only to fall 
back again. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost that title in 1988 after FBI agents raided the Capitol, searching his 
offices and those of three other legislators.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Nolan's staff members began cleaning out their offices. His 
Republican colleagues moved immediately to give his seat on the Assembly Rules 
Committee to a colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Carl Ingram and Jerry Gillam also contributed to this 
story.

BACKERS SAY NOLAN'S PLEA IS 'LIKE A DEATH IN THE FAMILY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Assemblyman Pat Nolan visited engineering mogul Joseph Jacobs at his 
Pasadena office last year to persuade him of his innocence, he left Jacobs 
believing that the Glendale Republican was merely a target of political 
blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs was so convinced that he wrote checks in 1993 totaling $36,000 to the 
Friends of Nolan defense and campaign fund. In an interview earlier this month, 
Jacobs said: "I've gotten his side of the story and it all hangs together as 
far as I'm concerned. I think he's incorruptible." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs is just one of hundreds of supporters who gave their money and faith to 
Nolan as he prepared to face trial next month on federal political corruption 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In coast-to-coast fund-raisers, Nolan raised $522,734 last year from 
unwavering backers ranging from business executives to homemakers to fellow 
Republican politicians. In his quest, Nolan, 43, managed to enlist the help of 
some big names in the world of conservative GOP politics -- Oliver L. North, Ed 
Rollins, Lyn Nofziger and Robert Novak. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his supporters, like the president of Jacobs Engineering, who could 
not be reached Friday, were visited by the assemblyman. In those face-to-face 
discussions, Nolan explained how he came to accept two $5,000 checks in the 
mid-1980s from an undercover FBI agent who posed as a businessman seeking 
special benefits for a bogus shrimp processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
 But few were prepared for Friday's turn of events, when Nolan, who had 
vigorously asserted his innocence, resigned from office, pleaded guilty to one 
count of racketeering and was sentenced to 33 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 One loyal backer, who spoke to Nolan on Thursday night, said the news hit the 
network of supporters "like a death in the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Nolan's contributors reached Friday said they hold fast to their 
belief that Nolan is innocent, despite his admission in court that he committed 
a crime. They said they view his action as a tough choice made for the benefit 
of his family -- particularly his three young children, the oldest of whom is 
5. Had Nolan not pleaded guilty to the single count, he might have faced more 
than eight years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Even knowing that Nolan had pleaded guilty, Glendale attorney Tom Jeffers, 
another longtime campaign contributor, said he is convinced that "Pat would 
never do anything dishonest, not in the slightest." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale contractor and political contributor John Gregg said: "My enthusiasm 
for Pat has not waned one bit. Now I have an even greater level of sympathy for 
the man. As a matter of fact, that's what they had for Christ when they nailed 
him to the cross." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Nolan were sharing the news with dismay, said Glendale Mayor 
Larry Zarian, who is being mentioned as a possible GOP candidate to fill the 
43rd Assembly District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Pat as a hard-working, giving individual. I'm surprised and I'm 
saddened," Zarian said. "To me it's a shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a California Democratic Party official said Nolan's resignation 
opens up possibilities in a longtime Republican district that has seen an 
increase in the number of traditionally Democratic Latino, African American and 
Asian American registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two credible, good candidates who are running," said Joel Maliniak, 
Democratic Party spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
 Democrats Adam Schiff, a former U.S. attorney, and Ken Kulpa, a community 
activist, are planning to square off in the primary. Three Republicans had also 
filed declarations to run against Nolan -- Taryn McNatt-Lorimer of North 
Hollywood, Matthew Collins of Burbank and Peter Repovich of North Hollywood, a 
Los Angeles police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan's resignation automatically reopens the filing period for the June 
primary for five days. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has 14 days to call a special election to fill the remainder of 
Nolan's term. The special election must be held within 120 days of Wilson's 
proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan never denied to his supporters that he took the FBI's checks, backers 
said. His argument was that he treated the transaction as he did any other 
campaign contribution -- by refusing to let it color his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "They accused him of taking a bribe in exchange for voting for creation of an 
enterprise zone, but since he's been in office he's always supported enterprise 
zones to create jobs," Jeffers said. "He's truly a straight arrow through and 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan's decision Friday "came as a complete surprise to me," Jeffers said, 
"but I know he did it because the cost of defending himself was so high and 
because the courts are so unpredictable." In the last half of 1993, campaign 
records show, Nolan had $200,000 in legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, Nolan's contributors say one thing in particular endeared him to 
them -- his level of commitment to conservative politics, mostly in the area of 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is rare to find the unique character of somebody who understands how a 
free-market economy works and has the guts to fight for it," Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Nolan's decision to plead guilty, Gregg said: "I'm extremely despondent at 
what he's done. I wish he would have gone for the 1 in 10 chance that he would 
be found not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Pat would have gone for broke if he didn't have such a great 
commitment for his wife and children. It's too bad he's not still the bachelor 
he was when he first got into politics 15 years ago."

JANSEN STREAKS TO GOLD, LEAVES FAILURES BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six years to the week after his sister Jane died of leukemia, thrusting him 
into the center of one of the most enduring Olympic dramas, speedskater Dan 
Jansen took a victory lap Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 With a gold medal draped around his neck and a spotlight focused on him in the 
otherwise darkened Olympic Hall, Jansen waved to a cheering crowd of 12,000 
while carrying his daughter in the other arm. She was born last May, and her 
name is Jane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our saga started back in Calgary when Dan lost his sister, Jane," said 
Jansen's wife, Robin. "The saga ended today, and we wanted it to end with the 
new Jane in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 It ended with an exclamation point. Not only did Jansen, 28, of Greenfield, 
Wis., win the 1,000 meters in the Winter Olympics, he set a world record, 1 
minute 12.43 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 The favorite, Belarus' Igor Zhelezovsky, was almost three-tenths of a second 
slower in 1:12.72 and finished second. Russia's Sergei Klevchenya was third in 
1:12.85. 
</P>
<P>
 Half an hour after the medal ceremony, Jansen's post-race news conference was 
interrupted by a telephone call from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the whole country is proud, and he said he understood a little bit 
what I've been through because his campaigns have been up and down," Jansen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes later, Hillary Rodham Clinton called to offer congratulations 
from an airplane over South Dakota. She and daughter Chelsea were inside the 
Olympic Hall last Monday to witness the most recent of Jansen's Olympic 
disappointments in the 500 meters, a race he had been expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Speedskaters Eric Heiden and Bonnie Blair became widely known in the United 
States when they won Olympic gold, while others usually toil in obscurity. 
Jansen's high profile was a result not of his many accomplishments in the sport 
but of his failures. 
</P>
<P>
 They began under the most unnerving circumstances. Five hours before he was 
scheduled to compete in the 500 meters in the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary, 
Canada, he learned that his sister, Jane Beres, had died after a lengthy battle 
with leukemia.  
</P>
<P>
 He skated that afternoon because, he said, his sister would have wanted him 
to, but unable to concentrate, he fell only 10 seconds into the race. Four days 
later, on the afternoon he would fly to Wisconsin for his sister's funeral, he 
competed in the 1,000 and fell again. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four years before the next Winter Games, at Albertville, France, Jansen 
established himself as the favorite in the 500 meters and a medal contender in 
the 1,000. But constantly reminded in interviews of his sister's death, he 
admitted later that he was unable to focus on his races. 
</P>
<P>
 He inexplicably hesitated while entering the final curve in the 500 meters and 
finished fourth. His confidence eroded, he was 26th in the 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting advice from his coach and a sports psychologist, Jansen adopted a 
new approach in the months leading to the competition here, deflecting 
questions from reporters about previous Olympic experiences by saying that he 
was focusing only on the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the moment he had Monday in the 500 meters was so reminiscent of others he 
has had in the Olympics that he could not avoid addressing the past. Searching 
for an explanation after he had slipped twice in the last curve and finished 
eighth, he said, "Maybe it's not meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
 He vowed, however, that he would not quit, and when he arrived Friday at the 
Olympic Hall, a state-of-the-art arena designed to resemble an upside-down 
Viking ship, he discovered that the crowd had not quit on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only were the few Americans here cheering him, so were speedskating fans 
from other countries where Jansen has become a heroic yet sympathetic figure. 
The Norwegians waved flags and clanged cowbells for him as if he were one of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jansen crossed the finish line in a time that was unlikely to be beaten 
by remaining competitors, the commentator for Norwegian television screamed, 
"Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen covered his eyes with his hands and began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 So did his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday's race, Robin Jansen, a devout Catholic, admitted that her faith 
had been tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I saw him slip, I said, 'Why, God? Why again?' " she said then. 
"God can't be that cruel." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, she said her husband's perseverance had been rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew when I saw the time that it was going to be first place," she said. "I 
was elated. My hands went to the heavens, and I said: 'Thank you! Thank you! 
Thank you! He finally got what he deserved.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I didn't feel real good. I almost fainted." 
</P>
<P>
 She was taken to the arena's medical center but released after she calmed down 
several minutes later, in plenty of time to see her husband in the emotional 
medal ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears welling in his eyes after he had received the gold medal from Anita 
DeFrantz of Los Angeles, a member of the International Olympic Committee, 
Jansen quietly sang the words to "The Star Spangled Banner." When the music 
stopped, he looked up and gently saluted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was to my sister, Jane," he said later. "When I go through hard times, I 
think about her quite a bit. It's not a sad feeling anymore. That's gone. It's 
just a feeling that she's still with me."

MIDEAST; LONG A HAVEN FOR THE LAWLESS, BEIRUT DECLARES WAR ON CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN and MARILYN RASCHKA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Naeb Maaytah was pulling out of a parking lot near his Beirut home one morning 
late last month, en route to work at the nearby Jordanian Embassy, when a young 
man approached his car. 
</P>
<P>
 He said nothing to Maaytah, 43, Jordan's second-ranking diplomat in the 
Lebanese capital. He simply leveled a pistol, fired seven times into Maaytah's 
head and neck and walked casually away. 
</P>
<P>
 It was murder as usual in war-weary Beirut, a city long synonymous with 
terror, assassination and anarchy. But in the weeks since Maaytah was gunned 
down like thousands of other victims of political killings during Beirut's 
decades of turmoil, something extraordinary has happened: Lebanese police 
actually arrested a suspect in the case, along with a gang of alleged 
accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
 A young Palestinian, Youssef Mahmoud Shaaban, was identified by Lebanon's 
Internal Security Forces as the suspected gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests were the first in such a case since Lebanon's 15-year civil war 
erupted in 1975, leaving much of its capital a lawless ruin and a world 
headquarters for international terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 They resulted from one of the most intensive investigations in the nation's 
history, directed by the brigadier general who heads Lebanon's judicial police 
and spurred on by almost daily personal inquiries from Lebanese Prime Minister 
Rafik Hariri. 
</P>
<P>
 If that weren't enough to show that times are changing in Beirut, police also 
picked up five additional suspects in the case Thursday. In coming weeks, 
Lebanese prosecutors say, officials hope to set yet another precedent: to try 
to convict the suspects on murder charges in a court of law. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the case has taken on enormous symbolic importance for the Lebanese 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid and efficient police work in the case has become a new centerpiece 
of Hariri's crusade to prove to his neighbors, to America and to the West that 
a new age of law and order has dawned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 29 assassination threatened to sidetrack Hariri's campaign to 
re-establish international respectability for a land desperate for outside aid 
and investment. Throughout the last year, relative calm and economic growth 
rates of about 7% had led to the reopening of such key foreign missions as the 
Saudi Arabian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confidence had begun to return, and the Lebanese had begun to revel in it, 
boast about it," Ghassan Tueni, a former Cabinet minister and diplomat, wrote 
in Beirut's leading Arabic daily newspaper, An Nahar. "Has confidence now 
melted in the furnace of fiery statements about wars that refuse to end?" 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent Lebanese analysts say the tough police work and the arrests in the 
Maaytah case were not merely a product of Hariri's resolve to quell such fears. 
Most saw it in a broader regional context, as a sign of a potentially even more 
significant change in attitude on the part of Syria.  
</P>
<P>
 With 25,000 troops on Lebanese soil, Syria commands ultimate influence in 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
 Hariri conceded that Syrian secret police helped to track down Maaytah's 
suspected killers, most of them members of a radical Palestinian faction that 
Syria has permitted to operate in Lebanon for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Syria is more responsible about security here because of the peace process," 
said An Nahar's executive editor, Edmond Saab, who linked the investigation 
directly to Syria's broader desire for progress in ongoing peace talks with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 For the battle-fatigued Lebanese, other events in the aftermath of the arrests 
in the Maaytah case seem to confirm that calmer times lie ahead for Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 11, police arrested another suspect in an unrelated case: Ghaleb 
Hussein Jamal, 38, was charged with running an "academy of terrorism" in a 
local Palestinian refugee camp, where he allegedly charged $50 per session to 
teach young radicals how to stage terrorist attacks. And, four days later, the 
International Pilots Union formally removed Beirut Airport, the site of many a 
hijacking in the past, from its terrorism-advisory list, citing "improvements 
in security conditions (for) incoming and outgoing aircraft." 
</P>

correspondent Raschka from Beirut.

ECONOMICS; UNEMPLOYMENT RAVAGES NATIONS ON GLOBAL SCALE; U.N. REPORT SHOWS 
JOBLESS RATES AT THEIR HIGHEST IN DECADES. BUT ASIAN ECONOMIES DEFY THE BLEAK 
ASSESSMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Whether rich or poor, almost every government on Earth reigns over an economy 
that fails at supplying enough jobs to reduce the dispiriting and growing 
numbers of men and women without work. The only exceptions are the newly flush 
lands of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people are out of work than ever before," reports the International 
Labor Organization, a U.N. agency, "and there is widespread anxiety that these 
numbers will grow." 
</P>
<P>
 ILO, surveying the world, reported recently that the industrialized countries 
-- Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan -- have 
unemployment rates "at their highest levels since the Great Depression" of the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of 1994, the agency predicted, 35 million people will be out of 
work in these industrialized countries, an unemployment rate of 8.6%. To make 
matters worse, an increasing number of the unemployed are finding no work for 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, Belgium and Ireland, more than 60% of the unemployed are such 
long-termers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people are out of work for more than a year," the ILO report says, "they 
lose skills and work habits and cease to be attractive to employers." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia and Eastern Europe, transforming themselves from communism to 
capitalism, are suffering massive job losses, the report said. ILO, in fact, 
says it does not believe official figures that show the unemployment rate in 
Russia at less than 1%. The countries of the former Soviet Union probably have 
an unemployment rate of more than 10%, it asserts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst aspect of the economic restructuring is the appalling growth in the 
number of people living in poverty," ILO says, estimating the number of poor in 
the former Soviet Union at 100 million at the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Latin America, while improving, still has unemployment rates worse than in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 ILO says there has been a disturbing increase in the number of what it called 
"precarious" workers -- part-time, poorly paid laborers -- in picking and 
processing coffee, sugar cane, cotton, fruit and vegetables for export. 
</P>
<P>
 Africa is in a woeful state: The number of those without work is ballooning 
and the wages of those with work plummeting. During the 1980s, wages dropped by 
70% in Tanzania and 40% in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 Unprotected by government safety nets, millions of urban Africans survive by 
living off relatives in the bush or working in what academics call "the 
informal economy" -- selling matches, chewing gum and other petty goods on 
street corners, guarding cars for tips and begging. 
</P>
<P>
 ILO suggested three causes for the worldwide malaise: 
</P>
<P>
 * The decline in economic growth rates since the first "oil shock" of 1973, 
especially among the industrialized countries, which account for 75% of the 
world's gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A veritable technological revolution" in such fields as microelectronics, 
computer science, telecommunications and transportation. ILO said this 
revolution makes it easy for companies to operate swiftly in any part of the 
world, thus intensifying worldwide economic competition. To meet this 
competition, large corporations are slimming down, eliminating well-paying 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Failure of government policies: overprotection of the economies in the 
1970s, a swing too far in the opposite direction toward a liberal free market 
in the 1980s and the imposition of tight money policies on debtor Third World 
countries that proved of little benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 The striking exceptions to this barren landscape are Singapore, Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand.  
</P>
<P>
 ILO, though not wildly optimistic, believes that their success may point a way 
out for the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important of what ILO calls "pointers to possible solutions" is that 
these countries welcomed foreign investment and foreign know-how to a free 
market at a time when most other developing countries were trying to protect 
non-competitive domestic industries with a tariff wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic strategy followed by the East and Southeast Asian economies," the 
report says, "was the antithesis of the protectionist and interventionist 
policies followed by many developing countries in the 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
 To make their economies more competitive, the Asian governments invested 
heavily in infrastructure and education. "No less important were policies to 
reduce poverty, since the poor have never been an asset in international 
competition," ILO says. A World of Job Woes 
</P>
<P>
 "More people are out of work than ever before," reports the International 
Labor Organization, a U.N. agency. Among its findings: 
</P>
<P>
 Latin America, while improving, still has unemployment rates worse than in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ireland and Italy, 60% of jobless are long-termers. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of those without work in Africa is ballooning and the wages of 
those with work plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Countries of the former Soviet Union probably have an unemployment rate of 
more than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea and Singapore are among nations where outlook is improving.

PACKWOOD LOSES LEGAL FIGHT TO KEEP DIARIES FROM PANEL; PROBE: APPEALS COURT 
REFUSES TO ALLOW DELAY IN TURNING OVER MATERIALS TO SENATE ETHICS COMMITTEE. 
TRANSFER COULD BEGIN AS EARLY AS TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A federal appeals court refused on Friday to keep Sen. Bob Packwood's diaries 
from the Senate Ethics Committee while he appeals the panel's subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 The order means the Oregon Republican's diaries could begin making their way 
to the committee as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood "has not satisfied the stringent standards required for a stay 
pending appeal," said a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The order left intact a 15-day timetable set by U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson on Feb. 7 to begin transferring the diaries to the committee 
for its investigation of allegations of sexual misconduct, witness intimidation 
and obstruction of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any comment at this time" on the appeals court's order, said 
Packwood's press secretary, Bobbi Munson. His lawyer, Jacob Stein, was in a 
conference and could not be reached for immediate comment, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood's lawyers say the Ethics Committee's subpoena violates the senator's 
right of privacy under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment as well as his Fifth 
Amendment protection against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 In an order initialed by Judges Harry T. Edwards, David B. Sentelle and A. 
Raymond Randolph, the court said it would expedite Packwood's appeal. Argument 
was scheduled for May 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein argued before Jackson that the challenge to the subpoena would be 
meaningless if the diaries, which include audio recordings and transcripts, 
were given to investigators before the appellate court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate lawyers said in court papers this week that Packwood's refusal to 
cooperate with the committee threatened Congress' self-policing powers. They 
said they "never before needed to issue a subpoena to a senator." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethics Committee is investigating allegations that the senator made 
unwanted sexual advances to more than two dozen women, used his staff to 
intimidate witnesses, solicited job offers from lobbyists for his wife and 
obstructed the congressional probe by altering the diaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood initially gave the committee his diaries, but cut off access to 
diaries covering 1989 to the present after the panel found segments that showed 
lobbyists and business executives offered his wife a job during their divorce 
proceedings.

ISRAEL EMBARKS ON NEIGHBORLY MISSION OF HOPE TO SYRIA; MIDEAST: GOVERNMENT 
REACHES OUT TO BEREAVED ASSAD. IT IS HOPED KINDNESS WILL ALSO SPUR PEACE.

 The head of Israel's Democratic Arab Party said Friday that he will lead an 
official delegation of Israeli Arabs to Damascus, marking the first visit to 
Syria of a member of Israel's Parliament, the Knesset. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-member delegation of municipal leaders, writers, religious figures and 
others will pay condolences to Syrian President Hafez Assad on the death of his 
son, but Israeli officials hope the visit may also indicate an important thaw 
in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a positive signal, and I praise this signal, but it has its 
limitations," said Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. "This is not yet an 
outbreak of opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Knesset member Abdul Wahab Darawshe, who will head the delegation on its trip 
during the next few days, said the group was going on a strictly humanitarian 
mission, but he did not rule out possible advances in the peace process between 
Israel and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may project a better atmosphere. I believe, generally speaking, that the 
visit will have a positive impact on peace," said Darawshe, one of seven 
Israeli Arabs in the 120-seat Knesset and a leading spokesman for Israel's 
800,000 Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Arab Knesset member, Talib Sanaa, will also be part of the delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes as peace talks between Israel and Syria reopened this 
week in Washington, strained by the firing on Wednesday of a Russian-made 
Katyusha rocket into northern Israel from southern Lebanon, the first violation 
of a cease-fire that ended a major Israeli military operation last June 
designed to wipe out guerrilla operations on the Israel-Lebanon border. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Syrian forces control the majority of Lebanese territory, Israel 
quickly raised an alarm, and U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley met with Lebanese 
President Elias Hrawi to urge a halt to the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, conferring in Washington with Israeli 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin, telephoned Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk 
Shareh. The situation reportedly was calmed when U.S. officials transmitted to 
Israel a message that Damascus stands behind the cease-fire agreement and had 
been unaware of the Katyusha firing into the western Galilee. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, Israeli officials sought to lower the temperature, saying they 
believe the rocket was fired by a Palestinian fringe group, the Black 13th of 
September Brigades. That organization was founded in southern Lebanon by 
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat's disgruntled former 
military commander after the signing of the Sept. 13 peace agreement between 
Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand this Katyusha came from the side of a marginal and unimportant 
organization," Peres said. "I would not build the entire policy on the (basis) 
of the shooting of one Katyusha." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel's understanding with Syria concerned 
operations of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon, not 
other organizations. "The understandings in the area with the Syrians regarding 
Hezbollah remain in force," he said. "Our understandings were about the 
operations of Hezbollah, and they are being kept." 
</P>
<P>
 Up to seven more Katyusha rockets were fired into Israel's self-declared 
security zone in southern Lebanon on Thursday and Friday, and Israeli defense 
forces hit back with artillery fire. There were no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement that an Israeli Arab delegation would be permitted to visit 
Syria followed complaints by Rabin that an earlier Syrian refusal to admit the 
group represented Syria's failure to take the peace process seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regretfully, even if I believe that Syria wants peace, according to its 
behavior, Syria is not doing what is necessary in order to truthfully 
demonstrate to the Israeli people that it has genuinely turned toward peace," 
Rabin said after Syria initially rejected the delegation's visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnabout came after intervention from Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir 
Moussa and was conveyed this week to the Israeli Arab delegation by Egypt's 
ambassador to Israel, Mohammed Bassiouny. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I know, it is the first time that the Syrian government is allowing an 
Israeli Arab citizen to enter Syria," Darawshe said. He said that while the 
delegation expects to meet with Assad, they do not have any specific political 
agenda to discuss, nor will they be carrying any messages from Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to express our condolences to the president, his family and the 
Syrian people over the death of his son," he said. "There is no connection with 
the peace efforts, but if anything useful should arise from the visit, I would 
welcome it." 
</P>
<P>
 Assad's son Basil was killed in a traffic accident last month.

MASKED REBEL CUTS SWATH THROUGH MEXICO; REVOLT: SOCIETY MATRONS ARE SAID TO

 Mexicans love a masked hero. 
</P>
<P>
 From Zorro, the nobleman who righted wrongs in colonial California, to 
Superbarrio, the modern-day wrestler looking out for the rights of the city's 
poor, disguise enhances the legend. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's little wonder that a sharp-witted rebel in a ski mask has become a 
celebrity as Sub-commander Marcos, the voice of the revolution in southern 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The society matrons that columnist Guadalupe Loaeza satirizes in the newspaper 
Reforma are all in love with the mysterious guerrilla, she claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am attracted to him because he is unknown, unreachable," Loaeza recently 
quoted one friend as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Another keeps a poster of him in her closet, where her husband cannot see it, 
the columnist wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The urbane, and admittedly urban, Marcos has created a bridge of sympathy 
between Indian guerrillas and university students, shop clerks and taxi drivers 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "His is a struggle born of the problems in Chiapas," said Juventino, a 
44-year-old Mexico City environmental consultant, who would not reveal his last 
name. "The people have no liberty in their own country. I believe he is doing 
what the people want him to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Other rebels also wear ski masks, which are as much a part of their uniform as 
red bandannas and fatigue pants. Nevertheless, it is Marcos who has made the 
mask his trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos emerged as the most quotable rebel during the New Year's Day guerrilla 
occupation of this colonial town and four other county seats in Chiapas, 
Mexico's most southern state. Mexican reporters who visited him at city hall 
came away with observations of his such as, "Now we will see whether those 
(expletives) keep on saying there are no guerrillas in Mexico."  
</P>
<P>
 Since the Zapatista National Liberation Army, as the revolutionaries call 
themselves, retreated to the jungle, Marcos is the name that has been signed on 
messages to the government and the news media. His communiques intertwine 
lampoons of Televisa, the unpopular television semi-monopoly, and intellectuals 
close to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari with graphic descriptions of the 
desperate poverty in rural Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels do not want Televisa present at the pending peace talks with the 
government, he said, "because they do not need to look for news; they just make 
it up." 
</P>
<P>
 His reaction to the government offer of amnesty: "What are they going to 
pardon us for? For not dying of hunger? For not keeping quiet in our misery? 
For not having humbly accepted the weighty historic burden of scorn and 
abandonment?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he will refer to the military strategy of Mexican Revolution hero 
Francisco Villa or that of Spanish conqueror Hernan Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos has revealed that he is a city boy who set out for the jungle, 
disillusioned, sometime after the 1988 presidential election, which was widely 
reported to have been rife with fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can say: 'You ought to try elections' " as a method for change, he 
told reporters from the independent daily La Jornada who interviewed him in the 
jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos claims to be one of only three non-Indians among the Zapatistas and to 
take orders from an Indian high command, called the Clandestine Indigenous 
Revolutionary Committee. Nearly seven weeks into the rebellion, authorities may 
know less about him now than they thought they did Jan. 2, when he was granting 
interviews in San Cristobal de las Casas. Based on a description of him as 
light-skinned, green-eyed and about 5 feet, 8 inches tall, with a prominent 
nose, the army mistakenly arrested three different men, including a Smithsonian 
Institution biologist. Since then, La Jornada journalists who interviewed 
Marcos have said that he actually has light brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is always the possibility both could be right. After all, three 
different men are known to wear the Superbarrio costume to march in 
demonstrations and wrestle symbols of evil and oppression wherever they are 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 On New Year's Day in San Cristobal, Marcos said, "This masked man may be 
called Marcos here and tomorrow be Pedro in (Las) Margaritas, or Josue in 
Ocosingo or Alfredo in Altamirano," naming other towns then held by rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Marcos claimed then that the ski mask, which has become his 
symbol, was meant to prevent the creation of personality cults among the 
guerrilla leaders, by making them indistinguishable from each other.  
</P>
<P>
 In lighter moods, he has offered other explanations for the mask, from: 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who are the most handsome have to protect ourselves," to: 
</P>
<P>
 "We started wearing them because it was cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone is amused or intrigued by the mask. 
</P>
<P>
 "People hide their faces to commit crimes," said Gen. Miguel Angel Godinez, 
army commander of Mexico's southeastern region, where the rebellion took place. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the public in general, the mask clearly adds to the Marcos mystique. 
As Nobel Literature laureate Octavio Paz wrote in "Labyrinth of Solitude," his 
study of the Mexican character, "The mask is the Mexican's true face." 
</P>
<P>
 If that is true, the growing popularity of Marcos-like ski masks could be an 
additional concern for an already worried government. At recent demonstrations 
in Mexico City, marchers have taken to wearing masks to symbolize their support 
for Marcos and the Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
 And the mystique of the mask seems to have taken over the man. Marcos 
described himself in a recent interview as "Just a ski mask with a prominent 
nose."

CHINA, BRITAIN, BELGIUM ACCEPT NUCLEAR WASTE DUMPING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A ban on nuclear waste dumping at sea moved a step closer to reality Friday 
with news that China, Britain and Belgium would toe the line and accept the 
restrictions in a last-minute change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 All three, along with France and Russia, had abstained when 37 other countries 
agreed in November to ban dumping at sea of low- and intermediate-level 
radioactive waste.Dumping of higher-level waste is already banned. 
</P>
<P>
 France had recently said it would change policy and go along with the ban, and 
the announcements in Britain, China and Belgium on Friday seemed to leave 
Russia in the lurch. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, Agriculture Minister Gillian Shephard said in a statement released 
to Parliament that Britain still believes scientific evidence suggests that a 
ban is unnecessary but that it would bow to international feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brussels, an Environment Ministry official said Belgium had changed its 
mind and would accept the ban. The official New China News Agency said Beijing 
would also fall into line. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban is being established under the terms of the London Convention on 
marine pollution and dumping, and the signatory countries that abstained in the 
November vote had until midnight Sunday to say whether they would toe the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ban is to be reviewed internationally in 25 years, and Britain said it 
would reopen negotiations if the weight of opinion changed in favor of 
radioactive dumping. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not legally binding on dissenting nations who are signatories to the 
London Convention. But they remain bound by its original ruling, approved in 
1972, which prohibits the dumping of higher-level radioactive waste.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven Nobel Peace Prize winners on Friday called on world leaders to meet in 
Sarajevo with the warring sides to try to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition was made public in the Costa Rican capital by former President 
Oscar Arias Sanchez, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts to 
bring peace to Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 A summit in the heart of the former Yugoslav federation "constitutes a 
realistic option to a conflict that threatens to spill over its borders . . . 
and become a danger for peace and security in the entire world," the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also was signed by fellow peace laureates South African Archbishop 
Desmond M. Tutu, 1984; Betty Williams and Mairead Maguire of Northern Ireland, 
co-winners in 1976; Kara Newell, executive director of American Friends Service 
Committee, which won in 1947; Romanian-American writer Elie Wiesel, 1986, and 
Argentine human rights advocate Adolfo Perez Esquivel, 1980.

NEWS ANALYSIS; SARAJEVO ULTIMATUM NOT END OF CLINTON'S POLITICAL QUAGMIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For President Clinton, the apparent decision by the Bosnian Serbs to accept a 
NATO ultimatum and remove their heavy guns from Sarajevo will not resolve a 
long-term political dilemma he has struggled with for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The current hopes for relief of the besieged capital might easily be dashed by 
a last-minute explosion in that volatile land. But even if the Serbs fulfill 
their commitment, Clinton's prominent role in forcing a reluctant Western 
alliance to deliver its ultimatum has raised the profile of American 
involvement in the intractable conflict and made backing away from future 
crises more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 As leader of the world's sole remaining superpower, the President still 
confronts the challenge of using the strife-torn Balkans as a crucible in which 
to fashion a post-Cold War formula for dealing with foreign crises. And he must 
achieve this without plunging the nation into a Vietnam-style quagmire that 
would wreck the activist domestic agenda he is committed to fulfilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens in Sarajevo in the days just ahead, the problem of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will not be over. At its best, the local truce demanded by 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would fall far short of resolving the 
deep-rooted conflicts that have been tearing apart the former Yugoslav 
federation for some two years. And the apparently unilateral decision by Moscow 
to send a contingent of Russian troops into the Sarajevo area only complicates 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 It is equally clear that as long as the threat of violence hangs over Bosnia, 
the demands from European allies and influential cohorts in this country for 
greater U.S. involvement will not cease. In fact, the United States is already 
at least theoretically committed to sending ground forces to the area to help 
maintain a U.N. peacekeeping force, although some analysts say the conditions 
for U.S. participation are so stringent that this may never come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be a huge mistake," Larry DiRita, a Heritage Foundation specialist 
on defense and foreign policy, said of the plan to dispatch about a division of 
U.S. forces to help patrol a partitioned Bosnia. "He (Clinton) sets himself up 
for the Republicans to say in 1996, 'Look, he's got a division bogged down in 
the Balkans.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to play a constructive part in the Bosnian crisis, Clinton must 
contend not only with the murderous religious and ethnic rivalries of the 
Balkans but with the relative indifference of most Americans to the violent 
upheaval abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "In foreign affairs, only two kinds of things matter to most Americans enough 
to be politically significant -- a great success or a great defeat," American 
University presidential scholar Alan J. Lichtman said. As Lichtman sees it, the 
chances of Clinton achieving a great success in Bosnia are slim, "so the best 
he can hope for is to avoid a major defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 How did Clinton get himself into such a pickle? Part of the answer is the new 
complications in international relations -- the penalty the United States and 
the West are paying for prevailing over communism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We no longer have a clear Cold War framework to guide people's thinking," 
says Stanley Greenberg, Clinton's campaign pollster who continues to advise the 
White House on political strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's predecessor, George Bush, also had to cope with this lack of public 
focus in dealing with the first post-Cold War international crisis, in the 
Persian Gulf. But Bush's task was easier because Iraq had committed a clear act 
of aggression by seizing Kuwait and because the Middle East with its oil 
supplies has long been considered vital to U.S. security. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Clinton faces the challenge of finding a convincing justification 
for American involvement in a civil war being waged in a corner of the world 
best known to Americans only as the powder keg that set off World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you could make the case there was a global Communist threat, you could 
justify sending 500,000 men to Vietnam," public-opinion analyst Ben Wattenberg 
said. "But you can't justify sending 500,000 men to Bosnia and take 200 
casualties a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also has himself to blame for his present conundrum, most analysts 
feel, because of his 1992 campaign criticism of Bush for not taking harsher 
measures against the Serbs. Clinton's comments built up expectations for his 
own performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was obsessed by the fact that he was not in service during Vietnam and he 
wanted to look tough," says Ted Van Dyk, a longtime policy adviser to 
Democratic presidential candidates who remembers hiring a young Bill Clinton to 
work as an organizer for George McGovern's 1972 Democratic presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively small but highly influential groups that support an activist U.S. 
role in the world in general and Bosnia in particular have not let the 
President forget his tough rhetoric. Their voices are raised in both parties 
and across the philosophical spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that we have both profound humanitarian and strategic concerns in 
Bosnia," Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, who was President Ronald Reagan's ambassador to 
the United Nations, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a function of presidential leadership to do what needs to be done and 
explain that to the people, and people will respond positively." 
</P>
<P>
 From another corner of the ideological street, Andrew Sullivan, editor of the 
relatively liberal and normally Democratic magazine New Republic, denounced 
Clinton's "dilatory, casuistic response to the Great Crime in the Balkans." 
Sullivan accused Clinton of "transforming the only superpower in the world into 
the only abdicating superpower in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the merits of their cause, many of those who seek to stir outrage 
over the bloodshed in Bosnia make a strong appeal to the emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Benetton, the Italian clothing company known for its promotion of social 
activism, ran a double-page ad in the Washington Post this week as part of a 
worldwide campaign; it depicted the blood-soaked clothes of a Bosnian soldier 
killed in battle along with a message from the soldier's father urging that his 
son's death be used "in the name of peace and against war." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is finding it hard to hold his own against such arguments, despite the 
"bully pulpit" of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton has tried every which way to avoid risks in foreign policy," says 
Bert Rockman, a University of Pittsburgh presidential scholar. "But he is 
discovering that in situations where the highly attentive opinion makers find 
inaction intolerable, he can't afford not to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Clinton supporters say that to have more impact on the public debate, the 
President needs to do a better job of articulating the U.S. position on Bosnia. 
"By going to the American people and stating what the mission here (in Bosnia) 
is," Clinton "would put Americans at ease . . . make himself less a target of 
Republicans . . . (and) send a message to the Serbs and to the world," Delaware 
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, told reporters this week. 
</P>
<P>
 And some advocates of an active U.S. role in Bosnia contend that the cautious 
approach favored by Clinton might be the most dangerous in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "A president's first responsibility is to keep the country safe and secure," 
said American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Joshua Muravchik, foreign 
policy adviser to Clinton's campaign. "If people get the feeling that this 
President is not competent at this No. 1 task, and other problems come up, such 
as the rise of a new dictatorship in Russia, then his inaction in Bosnia 
becomes not just a negative but a fatal weakness."

SERBS' WITHDRAWAL OVERSTATED, U.N. SAYS; BOSNIA: SPOKESMAN TONES DOWN 
ENTHUSIASM OVER PULLBACK. HE SAYS HANDFULS OF ARTILLERY, NOT 'CONVOYS,' ARE 
BEING REMOVED FROM SARAJEVO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief spokesman for U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia on Friday sought to tone 
down earlier enthusiasm over the first sizable pullback of heavy weapons from 
Sarajevo by rebel Serbs, saying he was wrong to have suggested entire convoys 
had been seen leaving the gun batteries ringing the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign that the artillery withdrawal remains sporadic in advance of a 1 
a.m. Monday deadline that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization set for 
punitive air strikes if the weapons are not pulled back or neutralized, Col. 
Bill Aikman amended his previous characterization of the first significant 
Bosnian Serb relocation of heavy weaponry. He said the pace had picked up from 
the few handfuls of aged artillery pieces turned over to the United Nations in 
the first week of the 10-day withdrawal period, "but to describe them as 
convoys was going too far." 
</P>
<P>
 His declaration late Thursday that U.N. monitors had watched entire convoys of 
weaponry being withdrawn suggested a mass-scale pullback by the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 In talks with U.N. Protection Force chief of mission Yasushi Akashi on Friday, 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic reiterated his promise to comply with the 
deadline for relocation or surrender of all tanks, mortars and rocket launchers 
from the high ground around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman declined to give specifics of how much weaponry has been moved out of 
the 12-mile radius of Sarajevo that NATO has ordered demilitarized. But his 
cautious descriptions of the latest withdrawals suggested they included no 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi was given assurances by both Karadzic and the greatly outgunned Bosnian 
government that they would complete the artillery surrender even 24 hours ahead 
of the deadline, said his spokesman, Peter MacFarlane. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been estimated that the Serbian nationalists, who have besieged 
Sarajevo since April, 1992, have as many as 500 heavy artillery pieces on the 
edge of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwelcome side effects of the first serious Western push to end the siege 
became clear as U.N. officials scrambled to aid the Serbs' partial retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the nearly 800 additional troops relocated to Sarajevo within the past 
few days to back 3,000 already deployed in this shattered capital were borrowed 
from other peacekeeping or aid delivery projects in the volatile region, Aikman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a crunch on. These people have jobs where they came from, and they've 
got to go back someday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. appeal for 3,000 to 4,000 more troops to enforce a cease-fire here and 
oversee the capital's demilitarization was met with resounding silence when it 
was issued last week. And the U.N. mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina is already 
short several thousand troops for protection of six "safe areas" proclaimed in 
the republic nine months ago, because contributing countries have become 
fearful of sending soldiers to what they see as a dangerous and largely 
unfocused mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The troop shortage has compelled the newly arrived U.N. commander for 
Bosnian-based forces, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, to borrow troops assigned 
to protect aid convoys in central Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman declined to say whether that action was the cause or a consequence of a 
decision by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees here to 
evacuate about 40% of its aid workers from Bosnia for security regions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a standard security measure. It's better to have a small staff during a 
tense security situation," said one official of the U.N. refugee agency, 
explaining the quiet move to get aid workers out of the areas most vulnerable 
to possible retaliation by rebel Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials have sought to cast the Serbian weapons withdrawals as solid 
evidence that the NATO ultimatum has succeeded, and some have suggested a 
similar formula of regional demilitarization might be applied throughout Bosnia 
in stages as a means of gradually ending the war that has killed well over 
200,000 and driven 2 million from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the persistent dearth of U.N. troops to enforce peace measures threatens 
to lead to a situation in which the besieging rebels simply move their 
artillery from one vulnerable region to another, drawing token U.N. deployments 
that enforce the status quo of fractured enclaves created by "ethnic 
cleansing."

NAGORNO-KARABAKH CEASE-FIRE READIED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh moved toward agreement Friday on a 
cease-fire in the 6-year-old war over control of the Armenian enclave inside 
Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Itar-Tass news agency said the accord was reached in Moscow during talks 
mediated by Russian Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev.A protocol was signed by 
the defense ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and a negotiator from the 
enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 The protocol must still be signed by the political leadership of the three 
sides before it can be implemented and a date set for the truce to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 15,000 people have been killed and 1 million have become refugees in 
the battle for control of Nagorno-Karabakh after the mainly Armenian population 
of the enclave began a campaign for independence in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense officials in Nagorno-Karabakh reported heavy fighting Friday after 
Armenian troops repelled an Azerbaijani offensive in the Omar Pass region of 
the mountainous enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said Azerbaijan suffered hundreds of casualties, and Armenian 
forces were in complete control of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides routinely exaggerate the losses of the other, and the figures could 
not be independently confirmed.

 A Chinese asylum-seeker posing as a policeman and accompanied by his family 
hijacked a Chinese airliner to Taiwan on Friday, the 11th such hijacking since 
April.  
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan detained the man for trial on air piracy charges.But in a break with 
previous practice, it forcibly sent the four family members who had traveled 
with him -- his foster mother, wife and two sons, aged 8 and 10 -- back to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin Wenqiang, 35, dressed in the uniform of a Chinese policeman, used a fruit 
knife and a fake bomb -- a teacup stuffed with toilet paper -- to force a China 
Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 to Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
 He surrendered to Taiwan authorities and requested asylum for himself and his 
family. The plane and its crew members and other passengers, including Lin's 
family, were sent back to China four hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time that Taiwan had forcibly repatriated family members not 
accused of air piracy.

POPE PLANS U.N. PILGRIMAGE, EAST COAST TREK

<P>
 Pope John Paul II may return to the United States this year, on a lightning 
East Coast visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican sources said Friday the 73-year-old pontiff hopes to address the 
United Nations in New York as it observes its 50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning is incomplete, but the late October stop in New York could be 
followed by short pastoral visits to Newark, N.J., and Baltimore, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither city has been among the Pope's stops on three previous U.S. visits,

IN VIRGINIA'S VULTURE CULTURE, GUARD PETS AND 'DON'T LIE DOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 With a loaded shotgun sitting next to her back door, Lynn O'Hara-Yates says 
she's living in terror of the dozens of black vultures that gather each morning 
on her back fence to stretch their wings, sharpen their talons and wait for 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, "lunch" has meant assorted pets in her Stafford County, Va., 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 When O'Hara-Yates tried to rescue one of her ducks last month, a vulture 
swooped down, whooshing within three feet of her head. The birds attacked again 
this week as she filmed them circling over children getting off a school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like something out of (Alfred Hitchcock's) 'The Birds,' " the 
42-year-old flight attendant said. "They're scary as hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Kings Grant development have counted about 200 vultures 
roosting in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first birds showed up in November, they were a curiosity. As their 
numbers multiplied, curiosity turned into concern despite assurances from state 
wildlife specialists and longtime residents that the huge birds wouldn't harm a 
living thing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last month, O'Hara-Yates has lost eight ducks from her pond, all of 
them picked clean to the bone. Her neighbor's cat, Stripe, was grabbed by the 
tail and carried 25 feet in the air for a distance of 100 yards. A vet stitched 
up the four talon holes in Stripe's body. Dogs and horses also have been 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightmare," said Stripe's owner, Jeude Barrett. "And we can't do 
anything. . . . They have no fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say they've been told that the harsh winter has exacerbated the 
problem, reducing the amount of "road kill" on which the birds normally dine. 
</P>
<P>
 Vultures are federally protected animals and cannot be killed without a 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those spotted in Kings Grant are black vultures, which weigh about 
five pounds and have a wingspan up to six feet. Black vultures are more 
aggressive than their cousin, the red-headed turkey vulture, and are common to 
the South, according to Paul Engman, a naturalist who works for the Fairfax 
County Park Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds, commonly called buzzards, prefer their food either dead or dying, 
Engman said, but on rare occasions have been known to swoop down on live 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Thomas, an inspector for the Virginia Department of Agriculture and 
Consumer Services, says he has seen horses, lambs, pigs and newborn calves 
attacked. Incidents have been reported in four other Virginia counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who is working to rid the Kings Grant area of its vultures, said he 
understands residents' concerns. "I would not be comfortable with a 2-year-old 
child playing around them. When they're hungry, meat's meat." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara-Yates said a game warden advised her that she would be safe while 
feeding the animals on her 14-acre property, but, he warned, "Whatever you do, 
don't lie down."

JUDGE ORDERS KEVORKIAN TO BE TRIED IN ASSISTED SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge refused Friday to dismiss the last remaining charge against retired 
pathologist Jack Kevorkian and ordered him to stand trial in the assisted 
suicide of a man with Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Recorder's Court Judge Thomas E. Jackson set the trial for April 19, 
saying he was not bound by previous rulings that Michigan's blanket ban on 
assisted suicide is unconstitutional. Three other charges have been dismissed 
by other judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, who advocates physician-aided suicide for the terminally ill, said 
a trial would be a "farce." He has been present at the deaths of 20 people 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's going to trample my rights," he said after Friday's hearing. "This 
trial is a touch of the Inquisition." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian is charged with helping Thomas Hyde commit suicide last summer. He 
faces up to four years in prison and a $2,000 fine if convicted in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers want to introduce as evidence a videotape of the 30-year-old 
Hyde -- who could barely speak, swallow or move -- asking Kevorkian to help him 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Tim Kenny is trying to block introduction of 
that tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, it's an emotional tape that generates a lot of sympathy for the 
defense," Kenny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyde died on Aug. 4 in the back of Kevorkian's 1968 Volkswagen van. Kevorkian 
called police to the van, where they found Hyde wearing an oxygen mask hooked 
to a carbon monoxide canister. 
</P>
<P>
 Three circuit court judges in Michigan have found the state's assisted suicide 
law unconstitutional on various grounds and dismissed three other charges 
against Kevorkian. The Michigan Court of Appeals is considering appeals of 
those rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny said he would have preferred to wait for the higher court ruling before 
proceeding with the trial. But Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's attorney, said he 
wanted to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be held hostage here. We want to go to trial," Fieger told 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian has at times gone to jail, staged a hunger strike and worn an 
electronic ankle bracelet under house arrest in his battle against the assisted 
suicide law. It was enacted by the Legislature last year specifically to stop 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Free on bail in the Hyde case, he is now leading a petition drive for a state 
constitutional amendment to declare assisted suicide a fundamental 
constitutional right.

TEXAS OFFICIALS INVESTIGATE DEATH OF PROSTITUTION RING SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state employee who was fired this week after being accused of running a 
prostitution ring from his office was found shot to death Friday, apparently 
from a self-inflicted wound, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 James A. Bunch, 46, who had worked for 23 years at the Department of Human 
Services, was found in a parking lot near his office. He had been fired Tuesday 
after being arrested on charges of aggravated promotion of prostitution, which 
is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest had set off intense speculation in the state capital about the 400 
or so clients of Aimes Escorts whose names and sexual preferences were listed 
on index cards seized by police. Authorities said Bunch ran the business for 
two years by using a state computer and telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Police confirmed that a state legislator was among the clients listed, but 
declined to identify the occupations of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch was interrogated after his arrest but did not appear to be distraught or 
suicidal, Deputy Chief Ken Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been my experience that when people . . . take their own lives, many 
times they do it in an area that is familiar to them, whether that be their 
home or their business," Police Lt. David Parkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent suicide left his co-workers shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our staff is still in a state of shock about the whole incident," said 
Mike Jones, an agency spokesman. "We are just an agency of about 17,000 people 
and most of us come to work every morning and just do our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch had said Thursday that the case had been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to cooperate," he told the Associated Press. "I want to help. But you 
need to talk with my attorney. I'm sorry I can't help more." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they found a .38-caliber pistol near Bunch's body and some 
"written material," which they declined to release, in his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkinson said an employee arriving for work found Bunch's body just after 7 
a.m. in a remote part of the agency's parking lot.

LIBEL SUIT IS REINSTATED FOR BOOK REVIEW IN N.Y. TIMES; LAW: APPEALS COURT 
ALLOWS $10-MILLION ACTION, SAYING CRITICISM IS HELD TO SAME STANDARD AS NEWS 
STORIES. WRITER ON NFL HAD BEEN CALLED 'SLOPPY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S. appeals court reinstated a $10-million lawsuit Friday against the New 
York Times for publishing a harshly critical book review, a decision libel 
experts said could make critics think twice about panning a book, play, movie 
or restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 opinion, the court said that a reviewer's comment that a book on the 
National Football League and organized crime contained "too much sloppy 
journalism" could be the basis for a libel verdict if a jury concludes the 
statement was false. 
</P>
<P>
 Book reviews, like news stories, can result in damage verdicts "if they imply 
a provably false fact," Judge Harry Edwards wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless overturned on appeal, the ruling will give author and investigative 
reporter Dan E. Moldea a chance to convince a jury that his book was factual 
and accurate, not sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
 "For an author, a harsh review in the New York Times Book Review is at least 
as damaging as accusations of incompetence made against an attorney or a 
surgeon in a legal or medical journal," Edwards added. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dissenting judge complained that the opinion "opens up the entire 
arena of artistic criticism to mass defamation suits." 
</P>
<P>
 "If a statement that Mr. Moldea wrote a sloppy book is defamatory, so would be 
a statement that Bette Midler wore a sloppy dress, or that Oliver Stone made a 
sloppy film, or that Itzhak Perlman had a sloppy technique," wrote Chief Judge 
Abner Mikva in his dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ruling illustrates a new trend in libel law. Since 1990, courts have 
increasingly held critics and opinion writers to the same strict standards for 
accuracy as news reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Before then, critics, columnists and editorial writers generally were seen as 
immune from libel suits because their words were labeled opinion, not fact. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Supreme Court threw out that distinction in 1990, ruling that false 
statements of fact in an opinion column can be the basis for a libel verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simply couching a statement -- 'Jones is a liar' -- in terms of opinion -- 
'In my opinion, Jones is liar' -- does not dispel the factual implications 
contained in the statement," wrote Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in the 
case of Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's decision relied heavily on that high court opinion. In recent years, 
other judges have permitted damage suits against restaurant reviewers and news 
commentators who misstated the facts in the midst of a harsh commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 But one leading libel expert said he feared that applying strict libel law to 
critics and commentators could force them to muffle their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sends a message that it is open season on reviewers who make candid, 
acerbic comments," said Rodney Smolla, a First Amendment expert at the College 
of William and Mary. "If you think a book or play was really bad, you would 
have to think twice about saying that. "My question is, do we want these 
decisions made in a courtroom, or do we want to let these matters be settled in 
the marketplace of reviews?" 
</P>
<P>
 But a lawyer who represented Moldea praised the ruling as a "victory for the 
small guy" against the most powerful force in book publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 When Moldea's book, "Interference: How Organized Crime Influences Professional 
Football," first appeared in 1989, it gained quick attention and had good 
prospects for selling well, according to his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Sept. 3, 1989, the New York Times printed a sharply critical review by 
Times sports writer Gerald Eskenazi, which said that the book was full of 
"errors and unfounded insinuations." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Eskenazi wrote: "(Moldea) revives the discredited notion that 
Carroll Rosenbloom, the ornery owner of the (Los Angeles) Rams, met foul play 
when he drowned in Florida 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Edwards noted, however, that while Moldea quotes friends of Rosenbloom 
who believe he was murdered, he concluded this section by saying: "In short, 
the evidence appears to be clear that Rosenbloom died in a tragic accident and 
was not murdered." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Roger C. Simmons, the author's attorney: "We believe we can prove that 
kind of assertion (by Eskenazi) had no factual basis. And it had a devastating 
impact on (Moldea's) career."  
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Moldea sent a letter of reply to the New York Times soon after 
Eskenazi's review appeared, but it was not printed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had printed his reply, there would never (have) been a case," Simmons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the New York Times said that it would ask the full appeals 
court to reconsider the ruling by the three-judge panel. If that fails, the 
newspaper could ask the Supreme Court to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very disappointed in the majority's ruling, which we feel has been 
wrongly decided because it does not give sufficient constitutional protection 
for expressions of opinion in a review," the New York Times said.

RENO UNVEILS 'SWAMP CAMP' IN FLORIDA; CRIME: DETENTION CENTER WILL PUT YOUNG 
OFFENDERS TO WORK ON ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP PROJECTS. THEY WILL ALSO RECEIVE 
COUNSELING AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno traveled Friday to one of the most remote spots in 
Florida -- a vast, watery prairie filled with alligators and poisonous snakes 
-- to announce the Clinton Administration's latest response to violent juvenile 
crime: swamp camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp, modeled on the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, is the 
first of what White House officials envision as "last chance" detention centers 
on federal lands where felons under the age of 18 will work on environmental 
cleanup projects while providing low-cost labor to the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a Senate resolution passed last November, the Youth Environmental 
Service camps will be administered jointly by the Justice Department and the 
Interior Department. Other YES camps are being planned in Utah and at the 
National Arboretum in Washington, D.C., while the Department of Agriculture is 
looking at setting up similar camps in national forests in Oregon, North 
Carolina and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida camp, based at the site of an abandoned sawmill, will house up to 
20 young offenders convicted of crimes such as murder, rape or violent 
robberies. Under the direction of counselors rather than guards, they will 
spend up to a year eradicating exotic weed trees, clearing trails and building 
boardwalks. They also will receive counseling and vocational training. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have messed up the children of America too long over the past 30 to 40 
years," Reno said. "We have been indifferent to their problems. We've also 
messed up the environment." The camps, she said, offer a chance to help both. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno was joined at the dedication ceremony by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt 
and Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), who as the state's governor 12 years ago helped 
design a prototype of the Big Cypress camp. 
</P>
<P>
 That camp -- located near the northern edge of the Everglades in Venus, Fla. 
-- is operated by a private company, Associated Marine Institutes of Tampa, 
which has been contracted to run the Big Cypress camp. The cost will be paid by 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said he hopes to see the YES camps spread across the United States as a 
way "to get dangerous juveniles off the streets and into programs that work." 
He said serious offenders could be placed in remote settings such as Big 
Cypress, which is about 70 miles west of Miami, while nonviolent delinquents 
could work on government lands closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Attending the dedication ceremony were several youths now at the Venus camp, 
as well as a recent graduate who told Reno that the experience changed his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned how to discipline myself, I learned about the work ethic and how to 
have respect," said Demetrice Lee, 18, convicted of murder for his role in a 
1992 St. Petersburg pawn shop robbery in which his accomplice was killed. "This 
camp will work for those who want to help themselves and turn their lives 
around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who has completed one year of community college and works full time in a 
fast-food restaurant, was lauded by Reno as "representing the future of 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us reach out to children like Demetrice Lee and give them the love and 
structure they need," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said that although she supports some version of the so-called 
three-strikes-and-you're-out measure, in which repeat felons could be jailed 
for life, many young offenders could be better served by such camps. 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication ceremony, held in a National Park Service garage rather than at 
the campsite because of heavy rain, was a homecoming for Reno, a Miami native 
and former Dade County state attorney who has a passion for hiking through both 
the Everglades and the adjacent Big Cypress preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive west from Miami, Reno said she delighted in identifying for 
Babbitt the various herons, egrets and other wading birds that are abundant 
along the highway.

RENO SENDS MEDIATORS INTO ANTI-GAY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has ordered Justice Department mediators into their 
first case involving anti-gay harassment and threats, sending them to a tiny 
south Mississippi town where residents led by Baptist ministers are trying to 
close a feminist camp run by two lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 Two mediators from the department's Community Relations Service arrived Friday 
in Ovett, Miss. -- population 400 -- after Reno wrote a gay-rights group: "I 
consider the threat of violence in Ovett to be real." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno's order is the latest sign of the Clinton Administration's sensitivity to 
gay issues. Earlier in the week, President Clinton wrote a letter opposing 
state and local referendums designed to block gay civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Senate for the first time confirmed an openly gay official, 
Roberta Achtenberg, Clinton's nominee for a housing post. But Clinton angered 
as many gays as he pleased by watering down his plan to end the ban on 
homosexuals serving openly in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Reno ordered the FBI to investigate after Wanda Henson, 39, and 
Brenda Henson, 48, who set up Camp Sister Spirit on a 120-acre former pig farm 
outside Ovett, received a handwritten threat in the mail. Mailing such a threat 
could be a federal offense. They have also received telephoned threats and have 
locked the camp entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who consider themselves married, have about 20 women in residence 
helping rebuild the farm. They say they want to hold workshops on sexual 
harassment, sexual abuse and women's legal rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation in Ovett has clearly been dangerous since the time a dead dog 
was hung on the Hensons' mailbox and town meetings were held denouncing the 
women and pledging to drive them from town," said Peri Jude Radecic, director 
of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, which sought Reno's help in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 350 people gathered in nearby Ellisville at a meeting organized by 
the Rev. John Allen, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Richton, who said: 
"We are being invaded by activists with a radical agenda . . . people who are 
different and want to change our community." Donations were collected for a 
lawsuit aimed at closing the camp.

ROSTENKOWSKI'S REELECTION BID CREATING HIGH DRAMA; POLITICS: PRIMARY ELECTION

 The Democratic voters of Illinois' 5th Congressional District, a 
conglomeration of wealthy liberals, young families, gays and white ethnic 
working-class households, will make a choice on March 15 that could have an 
impact far beyond their slice of this city's north side. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, the powerful chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee, is making a bid for his 19th term in Washington, and the 
race is by no means decided. 
</P>
<P>
 A key player in the Clinton Administration's strategy for passing health care 
reform, Rostenkowski is under investigation in both Washington and Chicago. 
Allegations range from misuse of House Post Office money to padding his payroll 
with "ghost" employees. He has denied any wrongdoing, though he announced 
recently that he had reimbursed the federal Treasury for $82,000 in 
questionable purchases at the House stationery store. 
</P>

 Against this backdrop, challengers have created a drama in the upcoming 
primary election that would have been unthinkable a mere two terms ago. 
Rostenkowski has not one, but two, strong challengers from his own party in a 
field of five candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Simpson, a University of Illinois professor and a former Chicago 
alderman, did well against the incumbent in 1992. State Sen. John Cullerton, a 
party regular who entered the fray just last month, has quickly turned the 
rematch into a three-way competition. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Rostenkowski had seemed impervious to any opposition, rarely 
garnering less than 60% of the vote. Two years ago, in a redrawn district, he 
had serious primary opposition from Simpson, who had a political base in the 
liberal lakefront sectors. But Rostenkowski still won his party's nomination -- 
tantamount in Chicago to taking the seat itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, before the general election, the U.S. attorney in Washington issued 
subpoenas in the post office scandal. Rostenkowski took "just" 57% of the vote 
against Elias R. Non-Incumbent Zenkich -- the Republican challenger who had 
officially changed his name. By comparison, Rostenkowski had pulled in 79% of 
the general-election vote in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed even harder as the probe expanded, the 66-year-old Rostenkowski has 
been marshaling his forces of late. This week, U.S. Labor Secretary Robert B. 
Reich and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley offered strong testimonials during an 
appearance in the district. There is talk that President Clinton may visit 
before Election Day as well. And Rostenkowski is expected to launch a costly 
advertising campaign soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Tribune has endorsed him, in what the paper described as "a 
difficult call." An editorial said that "some of his actions have invited 
public distrust," but it cited "his long and impressive record of achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's supporters suspect that Cullerton's belated arrival on the ballot 
could also turn out to be one of Rostenkowski's secret weapons. If the 
anti-Rostenkowski vote splits between the two main challengers, the incumbent 
could snag a narrow victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cullerton has always been a loyal (Democratic) machine guy," said Tom Gradel, 
president of Simpson's campaign committee. "He's always voted with the machine. 
He depends on the machine support so if they really wanted him out of the race, 
they could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Gradel's mind, Cullerton believes "either he would cause Simpson to be 
defeated and get Rostenkowski in, or things split outright, he would be 
elected. He won either way." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Cullerton is ill-cast as an opponent of the Establishment's man. 
Someone from the Cullerton clan has held elective office in Chicago since 1870. 
The congressional candidate's cousins and uncles have held the titles of 
alderman, state representative, county assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 At 45, Cullerton has been a state senator for three years, and a 
representative for the 12 previous years. He had said publicly he would not run 
for Congress unless Rostenkowski decided not to run, but in the fall his 
attitude began to change. Some Democratic committeemen grew alarmed enough 
about the unfolding investigations to pick names out of the phone book and 
place calls in every ward in the 5th District, inquiring about Rostenkowski's 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results we got were astonishing," said Bernie Hansen, the 44th Ward 
committeeman, a Chicago alderman -- and a neighbor of Cullerton's. "It wasn't 
just the charges; they didn't like his attitude, like he was arrogant, like he 
was above it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen said he and others encouraged Cullerton to finance a professional 
survey. In January, he said, the results showed that 67% of the 500 people 
polled wanted a new representative in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Preferring Cullerton to the more maverick-style Simpson, Hansen urged his 
neighbor to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 The state senator differentiates himself from Simpson by arguing that he is 
more effective. He has not concentrated on the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to attack Dan Rostenkowski? No," said Dana DeBeaumont, press 
secretary for the Cullerton campaign. "We don't need to. The media (are) doing 
a very good job of informing the people about his troubles." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Rostenkowski should not be counted out. He "has been underestimated 
before," cautions the Almanac of American Politics. He will boast that he has 
brought an impressive share of federal money to Chicago and Illinois, and that 
he is needed to shepherd the Administration's legislative agenda on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the district, both the arguments for and against are clearly potent. "I 
think he stole," said Matt Furlin, a 33-year-old contractor who has voted for 
"Rosty" in the past. "I have to pay for my sins. Why shouldn't he have to?" But 
in the next breath, he added that Rostenkowski "brings home the bacon."

 A baby-sitter who killed a 10-month-old boy by hurling him across a room after 
he pulled her hair was sentenced in White Plains, N.Y., to up to 25 years in 
prison.The parents of Kieran Dunne referred to Ann Franklin as a "monster" and 
a "liar" as they spoke at her sentencing. After months of denial, Franklin, 26, 
pleaded guilty to manslaughter in December. Franklin said she had smoked 
marijuana and went to put Kieran in his crib Feb. 25, when he pulled her hair. 
She said she "got annoyed" and threw him across the room, smashing his head 
against the floor.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that if an air bag deploys, 
a child facing the rear -- as recommended by safety experts -- could be killed 
or severely injured. The bag inflates with such force, the agency said, that 
the impact can snap a baby's neck or cause severe brain damage. The agency said 
it will require the manufacturers of child-safety seats to put warning labels 
on them stating that children never should be put in the front seat in a car 
with a passenger-side air bag.

U.S. COURT UPHOLDS BAN ON MEDICINAL USE OF POT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court refused Friday to force the government to allow the 
use of marijuana for medical reasons by people suffering from cancer, AIDS and 
other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the 
George Bush Administration's 1992 decision barring doctors from prescribing 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision was supported by substantial evidence, the court said, noting 
that many medical experts testified "that marijuana's medicinal value has never 
been proven in sound scientific studies." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has said it is reconsidering the ban, and Arnold 
Trebach of the private Drug Policy Foundation urged the government to reverse 
the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball is in Mr. Clinton's court," Trebach said. "He can look up and say: 
'Enough of this foolishness.' He can do something compassionate." 
</P>
<P>
 Trebach said an appeal to the Supreme Court would be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the medical use of marijuana say there is strong evidence that 
it eases the nausea and loss of appetite caused by cancer and AIDS treatments, 
eases muscle spasms for people with spinal cord injuries or multiple sclerosis 
and alleviates the eye pressure that blinds glaucoma sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people were allowed to obtain permission from the Food and Drug 
Administration to use marijuana for such purposes starting in 1976. A few of 
those people are still allowed to use marijuana, but new requests have not been 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court said the Bush Administration showed a "reasonable preference 
for rigorous scientific proof over anecdotal evidence, even when reported by 
respected physicians." 
</P>
<P>
 The court also rejected claims that Bush Administration officials had a 
history of prejudice against the medical use of marijuana.

 The 23 states that have taken the brunt of this winter's icy blast will 
receive $300 million in federal emergency home-heating aid, President Clinton 
announced.The money will be distributed by the Department of Health and Human 
Services under a new formula intended to channel aid to those states that have 
had the worst weather and also have large numbers of low-income households. The 
targeted states, in the East and Midwest, had January temperatures totaling 100 
"degree days" more than their 30-year average. Degree days are a measure of 
cold. The higher the number of degree days, the colder the weather.

 The Marie Stopes Health Clinic in London said it has won British Health

they will have to buy a plane ticket to London and pay a $500 fee to do it. 
Anti-abortion groups called the decision a public relations stunt designed to 
promote what they see as a potentially dangerous pill and to force it on the 
U.S. market. But abortion-rights advocates hailed the decision as a major 
victory for women who want abortions but do not want to undergo a possibly

HEALTH ALLIANCE DETRACTORS GAINING THE UPPER HAND; INSURANCE: THEIR FEARS OF 
GIGANTIC BUREAUCRACIES FIND GROWING SUPPORT. REJECTION OF PURCHASING NETWORK 
CONCEPT COULD DOOM CLINTON'S PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To President Clinton, the gigantic purchasing alliances that constitute a 
central pillar of his proposed health reform plan would give consumers wider 
choices of health care plans and greater bargaining power versus hospitals and 
doctors -- plus a welcome guarantee that health insurers could not reject them. 
</P>
<P>
 To critics, the alliances are simply mammoth bureaucracies that would strangle 
competition, deny individual businesses the right to tailor health benefits to 
their own workers' needs and force individuals to give up their family doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Which of these visions comes closer to the probable reality? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Clinton, his critics are making considerable headway in 
convincing Congress of the negative view. And if their efforts ultimately 
succeed, it will be bad news for the President: Without health purchasing 
alliances, his entire plan could come tumbling down. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is counting on the alliances to hold down runaway medical costs. And 
if costs cannot be contained, his reform plan could quickly turn into another 
ruinously expensive government entitlement program run by an entrenched federal 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are looking at the beginning of a monstrous and potentially powerful 
agency . . . a massive bureaucracy erected to hide a government program," said 
Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.). "It's not at all clear who they will answer to, 
and I fear they will be accountable to no one." 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, the alliances offend some of the most powerful special 
interests in the health care debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies fear the alliances would squeeze them out of most of their 
medical business. Big corporations argue that, having only recently gained a 
modicum of control of their employees' health costs, they would lose that 
control to the alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress passes the President's proposal, "we're out of the benefits 
business -- we lose complete control of the system and it's all up to the 
government," said Dan Spiller, manager of benefit plans for the Mead Corp. 
"That's completely unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 These mysterious alliances, in simplest terms, are not quite so exotic as they 
may seem. The basic principle they rest on is one that big businesses, chain 
stores and discount merchandisers have followed for decades: centralize your 
purchasing to take advantage of economies of scale. 
</P>
<P>
 A supermarket chain that orders potatoes by the ton and cornflakes by the 
boxcar can negotiate better prices than the old mom-and-pop groceries that buy 
by the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a health care alliance representing several thousand consumers can 
theoretically drive a sharper bargain with networks of health care providers 
than individual patients could. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, large companies that provide health care benefits for their employees 
are already operating just like Clinton's proposed alliances. They now approach 
hospitals, groups of doctors and other providers and say, in effect, "We will 
deliver large numbers of patients -- and thus profits -- if you will cut us a 
deal on the price." The resulting agreements have brought changes and savings 
to employer-supplied health care programs in almost every corner of American 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 On a smaller scale, farmers in many parts of the country have long joined 
together in cooperatives to buy seed and fertilizer and other commodities at 
lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, families in cities sometimes form food-buying cooperatives to get 
better quality and better prices on such things as fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton's plan became law, almost all Americans would belong to the health 
alliance serving their state or region. The major exceptions would be those who 
were covered by Medicare and, in some cases, those who worked for companies 
with more than 5,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Each alliance would act as the sole health care purchasing agent for almost 
everyone in its region. It would negotiate with health maintenance 
organizations and insurance companies for the best deals for its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from that, their very size would allow the alliances to spread the costs 
of particularly expensive medical treatments over large groups, thus limiting 
insurers' exposure when they have to cover the elderly and the ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alliances are designed to end discrimination in the marketplace," White 
House senior health adviser Ira Magaziner said. "It is not right that because 
of your age or health status you pay more. If you want to achieve an end to 
discrimination, you need a large pool." 
</P>
<P>
 State governments would decide on the alliances' geographical boundaries and 
select their boards of directors, which would have to be equally divided 
between consumers and business representatives. No one working in the health 
industry -- doctors, nurses, hospital employees or insurance company employees 
-- could serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year a newly created federal agency called the National Health Board 
would set a target for total health care spending in the nation and give each 
regional alliance a corresponding budget target. The alliance would use its 
authority over fees and charges to keep spending at the required level. 
</P>
<P>
 A market such as Los Angeles would have one alliance, but the alliance could 
approve 10 or more health plans, probably including such well-known names as 
Kaiser Permanente, Blue Cross, Aetna and Prudential, for its individual members 
to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 All these vendors would be required to offer a standard, comprehensive set of 
benefits more generous than currently offered by most employers. Plans could 
offer extra benefits, such as prescription eyeglasses and cosmetic surgery, for 
extra charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a year, consumers could choose among the approved health plans. They 
could still go outside the doctors and hospitals that participate in their 
plans, but they would have to pay out of their own pockets for the medical care 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the theory. Proponents say it would achieve its goals with little or 
no pain to consumers or to providers -- if they are reasonable in their charges 
and efficient in their operations. Certainly the alliances would be far less 
bureaucratic than the paper shufflers who operate today's health care system, 
says Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.). 
</P>
<P>
 Critics reject that view and argue that the reality of the alliances would 
turn out to be anything but benign. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the impartial Congressional Budget Office, in its analysis of the Clinton 
plan, warned that the inexperienced alliances could be overwhelmed by their 
enormous job. 
</P>
<P>
 And not surprisingly, many segments of the existing health care industry worry 
about what the alliances would mean for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost are health insurance companies. The big ones, such as Aetna and 
Prudential, would probably assume the job of stitching doctors and hospitals 
into the provider networks that the alliances would offer to their members. 
</P>
<P>
 But they resist the degree of government supervision that the Clinton plan 
entails. And the small insurers worry that they would have no role at all. 
</P>
<P>
 In a television commercial sponsored by the Health Insurance Assn. of America, 
a young, concerned couple worries that "thousands of government bureaucrats" 
would dictate their health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses are no happier with the prospect that the alliances would wrest 
from them the control they now exercise over their own benefits programs. They 
don't trust the President enough to surrender that power to him, even in return 
for his promise to hold down health costs nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton launched his crusade for health reform, he counted on big 
business -- beset as it was by rising medical care costs -- to rally around his 
plan. After months of intense flirting, entreating and cajoling, however, the 
White House still has failed to enlist any significant business backing for 
health alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract big business support, the President's plan would allow companies 
with 5,000 or more workers to stay outside the regional alliances and create 
their own "corporate alliances." 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said recently that the 5,000 threshold could 
be lowered. 
</P>
<P>
 Business was not impressed. It argues that the gigantic regional alliances 
would so dominate the purchasing of health care that even the biggest 
companies, unable to compete, would have no choice but to join them. And it 
strongly objects to the 1% payroll tax that business would have to pay for the 
privilege of maintaining corporate alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Many executives refuse to believe the White House claim that corporations 
under the Clinton plan would spend no more than 7.9% of their payroll to buy 
insurance packages that include comprehensive coverage for doctor and hospital 
bills plus payments for prescription drugs and home care for the chronically 
ill.

LOIS PEYSER; SCREENWRITER TAUGHT AT AFI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lois Peyser, an award-winning screenwriter and the first person hired to teach 
that subject when the American Film Institute began offering writing classes, 
died Friday at her Brentwood home. She was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman said she had lost a two-year battle with ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 With her husband, Arnold Peyser, she had a string of successes in film and 
television writing. One of the high points of her career came in 1988 when she 
was honored with the Writers Guild Valentine Davies award, given annually to 
one who has "brought dignity and honor to writers everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 She was praised as a writer and mentor, and the couple were regulars on 
episodic television. Their credits include multiple scripts for "My Three 
Sons," "The Dick Van Dyke Show," "Love, American Style," "Mission: Impossible" 
and many more. 
</P>
<P>
 They also wrote for many of the best dramatic shows on TV, including the 
Alcoa, Goodyear and General Electric series. A videocassette of their Elvis 
Presley picture, "The Trouble With Girls," was recently released, while their 
latest work was the Fred Allen play "From Boston to Portland," which opened in 
Boston last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, the American Film Institute hired her to start a screenwriting class 
and she taught and offered seminars at AFI while serving as a consultant for 
the Directing Women's Workshops and as a teacher in Brussels, Moscow and 
Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her husband of 45 years, she is survived by two sons, three 
grandchildren, two sisters and a brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Private services are scheduled for Feb. 25 at noon at the Mark Goodson Theater 
at AFI. Donations may be made to the Lois Peyser Scholarship Fund for beginning 
writers at AFI.

STORM SCATTERS RAIN, HAIL AND SNOW ON SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unstable mass of air trailing Thursday's chilly storm dropped scattered 
rain, hail and snow on Southern California on Friday evening, and forecasters 
said a new storm should bring more precipitation tonight and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite briefly heavy rain in a number of areas Friday, there were no reports 
of new mudslides on the hillsides that were denuded during last fall's 
destructive brush fires in Malibu, Altadena and Laguna Beach. There were some 
slides in Malibu on Thursday, but damage was generally light. 
</P>
<P>
 Pea-size hail was reported during a blustery thundershower in Banning on 
Friday, and National Weather Service observers said their radar showed ice 
pellets in several cloudbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said heavy snow fell Friday afternoon in Idyllwild, Wrightwood and 
Big Bear City, with as much as six inches piling up in some areas by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow levels as low as 3,000 feet, with temperatures dropping into the 20s, 
were reported in some parts of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains 
Friday night. Police said driving conditions were hazardous in most mountain 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 No measurable rain had fallen at the Los Angeles Civic Center by 5 p.m., the 
time at which each day's last measurements are reported. The 0.77 of an inch 
that fell there Thursday raised the total for the season -- which is measured 
from July 1 to June 30 -- to 4.41 inches, less than half the normal season's 
total for the date and about one-fifth of the 21.85 inches that had fallen by 
Feb. 18 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the center of the new storm will pass to the north of the Los 
Angeles area, with only about half an inch of rain expected in the city and 
perhaps twice that much in some foothill communities by Sunday afternoon. They 
said there is a slight chance of a few additional sprinkles through Monday, 
with skies clearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures should remain on the chilly side in Los Angeles today, Sunday and 
Monday, with highs ranging from the mid-50s to the low 60s. High readings in 
the upper 60s and low 70s are expected Tuesday.

$5.8 MILLION, 1,000 POUNDS OF COCAINE SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal and local authorities in Ventura County have seized $5.8 million and 
nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine as part of a three-year nationwide 
money-laundering and drug-trafficking case targeting the two major Colombian 
cartels. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover operation, based in Ventura County, led to the arrest of one 
high-ranking member of the Cali cartel and 17 other members of the Cali and 
Medellin cartels.No details of the arrests were given, nor were the suspects 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 More arrests are expected when authorities seek a dozen federal indictments in 
the case next week. Five suspects have been secretly indicted in Los Angeles 
and Detroit, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Ventura on Friday, Sheriff Larry Carpenter said the 
case represents the largest confiscation of drug money in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to $2 million of the seized cash could be returned to the Sheriff's 
Department through federal asset forfeiture laws, he said. The money was seized 
at a variety of locations in several states over two years, including $1 
million last month in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint investigation by U.S. Customs officials and Ventura County deputies 
was launched in October, 1991, when an informant arranged a meeting at a 
Thousand Oaks hotel between undercover sheriff's deputies and a high-level Cali 
drug trafficker. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover agents infiltrated both Colombian cartels and met with traffickers 
in Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit, Chicago, New York and Newark, the sheriff 
said. Authorities say the two cartels are responsible for most of the cocaine 
imported into this country. 
</P>
<P>
 To gain greater access to the cartels, drug agents set up an illegitimate 
money-laundering organization based in eastern Ventura County that charged a 
fee to deposit drug profits in U.S. and foreign banks. The sums averaged about 
$500,000, but ranged from $100,000 to several million, federal authorities 
said.

SIMI VALLEY BOY, 13, PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO KILLING CLASSMATE, 14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 13-year-old Simi Valley boy charged with fatally stabbing a junior high 
school classmate pleaded not guilty Friday in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Steven Z. Perren set an April 18 trial for the boy, who will be tried as 
a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
 He is charged with a single count of murder in the Feb. 1 death of 14-year-old 
Chad Patrick Hubbard, a popular student and member of the baseball team at 
Valley View Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students have said the two boys had a running feud that escalated a week 
before the stabbing when the boy took Chad's baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen of Chad's relatives and friends appeared at Friday's 
arraignment. The boy's mother, grandmother and an aunt were also present in 
court. Both families declined to comment afterward.

PROSECUTORS WANT MENENDEZ RETRIAL MOVED DOWNTOWN; DEFENSE OBJECTS; COURTS: 
QUAKE DAMAGE IS CITED IN REQUEST FOR TRANSFER FROM VAN NUYS. OBSERVERS SAY 
MANEUVERING SHOWS THAT BOTH SIDES SEE JURY SELECTION AS CRUCIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors asked a judge Friday to move the retrial of the Menendez brothers 
Downtown, saying the earthquake-battered Van Nuys courthouse can no longer 
handle the high-profile proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense attorney said she would oppose the move. 
</P>
<P>
 In legal papers that arrived late Friday at Van Nuys Superior Court, 
prosecutors noted that the Jan. 17 quake damaged several floors of that 
courthouse. It also led to the closure of the multilevel parking structure 
across the street that serves court staff and jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under those conditions, prosecutors argued, it would be unreasonable to burden 
the courthouse with the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez, charged with murder 
in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their parents. The Downtown Criminal 
Courts Building, prosecutors noted, is "fully operational." 
</P>
<P>
 A move Downtown would also bring the case closer to Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti 
and his top lieutenants, who are under pressure to produce a conviction at a 
second trial. Garcetti has vowed that there will be no plea bargains, and that 
it will be tried again "as a murder case -- because that's what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, admit they killed their wealthy 
parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and Kitty Menendez, 47, in the TV room of the 
family's Beverly Hills mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend that the brothers killed out of hatred and greed. But the 
brothers said they killed out of fear fed by years of physical, emotional and 
sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 After six months of trial, separate juries, one for each brother, were unable 
last month to reach a verdict on either murder or manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg has scheduled a Feb. 28 hearing to 
set a new trial date. Prosecutors asked Weisberg to also consider the move 
Downtown at that hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Bozanich, the lead prosecutor, declined to elaborate 
on the transfer request. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Jill Lansing said the place for a transfer -- if there is to 
be one -- is to Santa Monica, the courthouse nearest Beverly Hills, where the 
slayings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has always been our request that it be handled in Santa Monica," Lansing 
said. "If not in Santa Monica, I'm not sure what the rationale is for having it 
in the Criminal Courts Building." 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale, prosecutors said in legal papers, is that the brothers were 
indicted Downtown and the transfer would simply be moving the case "back to the 
courthouse from which it came." 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal observers suggested that the maneuvering over the site of a retrial 
was evidence of the belief on both sides that the outcome of the retrial could 
hinge on jury selection. They said prosecutors probably believe that the 
blue-collar jury pool Downtown is likely to be less sympathetic to the 
brothers' emotional claims of abuse than the suburban jury pool in the San 
Fernando Valley -- and far less sympathetic than in affluent Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 From the prosecutors' perspective, said defense lawyer Harland W. Braun, "it 
doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where it should go." 
</P>
<P>
 Some pre-indictment hearings in the case were held in Santa Monica, but the 
trial was moved to Van Nuys when it was assigned to Weisberg, who is based 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the Downtown Criminal Courts Building offers the added 
advantage of high-security courtrooms, which would "be ideal for controlling 
media access to the trial proceedings and for insulating jurors from media 
contact."

MAHONY BACKS LEADERS OF CONFERENCE; CONFERENCE: CARDINAL OPENS GATHERING BY 
OFFERING SUPPORT FOR A NUN AND CONVENTION ORGANIZER WHO HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED BY 
CONSERVATIVE CATHOLICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger M. Mahony on Friday opened a religious congress by declaring 
his uncompromising support for two church officials under attack by 
conservative Catholics as "dissenters in sheep's clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony's backing of a leading nun in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles and a conference organizer of the annual religious event -- said to be 
the largest catechetical gathering in the world -- was greeted with an ovation 
from an estimated 10,000 delegates during the morning's welcoming services at 
the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the three-day convention, more than 20,000 delegates from as far as Poland 
and the Philippines are expected to participate in 240 educational workshops 
offering a range of topics from "Understanding HIV Infection and AIDS" to 
"Getting to Know Jesus Better." 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening remarks, Mahony rose to defend Sister Edith Prendergast and 
conference coordinator Adrian Whitaker. Earlier this month, a small coalition 
of conservative Catholic groups demanded their resignations for inviting 
conference speakers who are critical of the Catholic Church and have supported 
abortion rights, as well as the ordination of women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give my categorical and uncompromising support to the organizers," Mahony 
told the audience. "The overall good of this congress through the years is 
without question." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a dozen picketers distributed leaflets warning that the gathering 
could damage one's spiritual health, Mahony told delegates to smother the 
protesters with love. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cardinal supported Prendergast and Whitaker, Mahony withdrew a 
conference invitation two weeks ago to Daniel Maguire, a former priest and 
abortion rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, for reasons not disclosed, the Rev. John R. Aurelio of Buffalo, N.Y., 
was taken off the list of speakers after allegations surfaced that he molested 
two boys 15 to 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, delegates spent Friday listening to a host of workshop 
speakers in search of new material to incorporate into their church teachings 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming to something like this is a chance to get in touch with what's 
happening in the church as a whole and not just what's going on in your own 
little corner," said Douglas Clipperton, 43, who teaches adult Catholic classes 
in Mojave. "It's a good shot in the arm."

MARLA TRUMP'S EX-PUBLICIST TOLD TO WEAR ELECTRONIC BRACELET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marla Trump's former publicist was ordered Friday to wear an electronic 
bracelet while he appeals his conviction for burglarizing her home and stealing 
her shoes and underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Richard Andrias said he believes Chuck Jones "is a very troubled person" 
but disagreed with a prosecutor that he has violent tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to wearing the bracelet, Andrias ordered Jones to secure bond with 
the deed to his Greenwich, Conn., home, valued at about $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 52, was convicted Wednesday of burglary, possession of stolen property 
and weapon possession. He faces 1 1/2 years to 15 years in prison on the 
burglary count alone. Sentencing is set for April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic bracelet allows correction officials to monitor Jones' 
movements while he is under house arrest. The judge said he can leave home only 
to go to work or to attend to legal matters.

JACKSON BEING PERSECUTED, MINISTERS SAY; CELEBRITIES: REPRESENTATIVES OF SOME 
OF L.A.'S LARGEST BLACK CHURCHES DENOUNCE A 'PROSECUTION FRENZY' OF THE 
ENTERTAINER BY AUTHORITIES AND THE MEDIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jackson is being persecuted by police, prosecutors and the media, 
according to a group of ministers who called a news conference Friday to 
denounce what they called the "prosecution frenzy" surrounding the 
investigation of the world-renowned entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen ministers from some of Los Angeles' largest black churches 
joined in a statement suggesting that authorities are treating Jackson harshly 
because of his fame. The ministers also suggested that the news coverage has 
been unduly harsh in part because Jackson is black. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to think that it's not racially motivated," said William Epps, 
senior minister of the Second Baptist Church. "It does seem strange, however." 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference came as Jackson remains under scrutiny by Los Angeles and 
Santa Barbara prosecutors. A grand jury has been convened in Santa Barbara and 
has begun taking sworn testimony to determine whether Jackson should face 
criminal charges of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 That grand jury has taken testimony from several current and former employees, 
and sheriff's deputies are continuing to conduct an investigation. But neither 
Jackson nor the boy at the center of the case has yet been asked to testify, 
and there is some question as to whether the 14-year-old alleged victim will 
choose to take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, sex abuse victims cannot be compelled to testify against 
their will, a statute that Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has 
asked the Legislature to amend. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministers criticized Garcetti for that move, suggesting that it was 
motivated by a desire to persecute Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Garcetti is not new to the legal scene," the ministers said in their 
statement. "Where was his concern for alleged victims of sexual assault before 
Michael Jackson was accused? Does his degree of concern depend upon the status 
of the accused?" 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the news conference was devoted to the ministers' critique of the 
media coverage of the case, which has attracted international attention since 
last summer, when the allegations by the boy, who was then 13, became public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ministers did not single out news organizations for criticism, 
they said much of the coverage has insinuated that Jackson is guilty of child 
molestation. No charges have been filed against the entertainer, and a civil 
case brought against him by the boy was settled out of court for $15 million to 
$24 million, according to sources familiar with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Cecil L. Murray, pastor of the First African Methodist Episcopal 
Church, urged reporters to use caution in reporting the allegations against 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Curbside justice is no worse," Murray said, "than flashbulb justice."

DORNAN SAYS HE WILL SEEK 9TH -- AND FINAL -- TERM IN CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of apparent indecision, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) 
announced Friday that he will seek reelection to a ninth -- and final -- term 
in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement by the combative conservative that he will run again in 
central Orange County's 46th Congressional District means a postponement of his 
plans to seek higher office or begin a career as a talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dornan publicly had been coy about his political future, his plans 
were revealed in a fund-raising letter he sent to his supporters in which he 
underscored that this would be his "final race for Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask my supporters to ride with me one more time toward the thunder of the 
political battlefield," he said in a campaign statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the usual hoopla that accompanies campaign kickoffs, Dornan's 
announcement was low-key and limited to a two-page press release. Dornan was 
not available for comment, and his statement did not include his commitment to 
make this his last campaign for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dornan's press secretary, Brian Keeter, said the congressman strongly 
backs term limits and will honor his pledge to step down after the next term if 
he is reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Dornan said he is running again because he believes Congress 
"will be the primary battlefield" in the conservatives' fight against the 
Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not explain his rejection of other options he had considered, including 
a run for the GOP presidential nomination in 1996, going after the U.S. Senate 
seat held by Democrat Dianne Feinstein, or seeking a lucrative broadcasting 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear he waited until the last minute because this was the last thing he 
wanted to do," said Howard Adler, former chairman of the Orange County 
Democratic Party who heads Beat Bob Inc., a fund-raising committee organized 
last year to defeat Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does not want to represent the people of the 46th (district)," Adler said. 
"He has devoted all of his energy to finding another job. . . . I don't think 
he deserves to keep (the seat)."

HEALTH OFFICIALS PLAN INQUIRY OF GAS IN SUBWAY; RED LINE: FOUL ODOR IS BLAMED 
ON HYDROGEN SULFIDE, ABOUT WHICH SOME RIDERS AND WORKERS HAVE COMPLAINED. THERE 
IS NO CAUSE FOR WORRY, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
 The stench greeted passengers arriving Friday at the Civic Center subway 
station like hard-boiled eggs left too long in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unpleasant, to say the least," said Bart Blakesley, who when asked his 
opinion was already discussing the aroma with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, transit officials have said that water leaks and incursions of a 
different, odorless gas into the Los Angeles subway were no cause for worry -- 
although millions of dollars were spent during construction to keep the 
structures virtually sealed to gas. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, two public health officials said they will take steps to 
examine the pervasiveness of the sulfur-smelling gas, called hydrogen sulfide, 
in the tunnels and stations of the 4.4-mile Red Line subway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an issue that I think needs to be looked into," said Dr. James W. 
Stratton, a chief deputy director of the California Environmental Protection 
Agency in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments of Stratton and Dr. Paul J. Pananek, of the county Health 
Department's toxics epidemiology unit, came after they learned during 
interviews with The Times that levels of hydrogen sulfide in the subway 
typically range from 5 parts per million to 8 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
 Those quantities of hydrogen sulfide "are not uncommon" on any day, said Ralph 
de la Cruz, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's deputy executive 
officer for operations. Records obtained for Jan. 17, the day of the Northridge 
earthquake, show that hydrogen sulfide levels of 5 to 8 parts per million 
occurred at three different times -- volumes that doctors say could cause 
headaches, nausea or malaise. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal health standards warn against human exposure to hydrogen sulfide, 
among the most toxic gases, at a level of 10 parts per million or greater for 
more than 10 minutes. According to the National Institute of Occupational 
Safety and Health, hydrogen sulfide at levels of at least 50 parts per million 
can cause serious eye injuries and, at 300 parts per million or greater, can 
cause death. 
</P>
<P>
 Pananek and Stratton said that hydrogen sulfide at the levels detected in the 
Los Angeles subway could make people temporarily sick but would not be life 
threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Symptoms of nausea or headaches or malaise would not be unexpected," Stratton 
said. "At 5 (ppm) to 8 (ppm), it's up in the range where further scrutiny is 
warranted." 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious danger, the doctors said, would be if someone encountered a 
random pocket of the gas at a higher concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fatalities from hydrogen sulfide are an ongoing, perennial problem," said 
Pananek, referring to industrial accidents that occur when workers succumb to 
such pockets of gas, which is heavier than air and is typically concentrated at 
foot level. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton and Pananek said they believe the MTA should, on an experimental 
basis, place gas sensors at the lowest levels of the tunnels and stations to 
see if the volumes detected differ from the levels found by the raised sensors 
being relied upon. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials confirmed that the sensors for hydrogen sulfide and methane gas 
are at the tops of the tunnels and stations. Methane is lighter than air and 
concentrates most heavily at the crown of a structure. As for the 
heavier-than-air hydrogen sulfide, MTA officials said the elevated sensors are 
still reliable because the turbulence caused by trains and fans mixes and 
raises the gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once mixed with air, hydrogen sulfide does not again separate from it, 
especially in the tunnel's turbulent airflow," said MTA spokesman Bill Heard, 
who along with De la Cruz said the agency has no reason to suspect a health 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 De la Cruz said the MTA staff is reviewing the question of whether the same 
sensors can be relied upon to detect methane and hydrogen sulfide.  
</P>
<P>
 Franklin E. White, the MTA's chief executive officer, said the matter has not 
been brought to his attention. "I'm confident my people will look at the 
situation and make sure our present arrangement is suitable," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of hydrogen sulfide and methane were noted in reports prepared in 
advance of subway construction. De la Cruz said Friday that he believes the 
hydrogen sulfide is entering the subway through the many cracks in the tunnel 
and through breaches in a plastic gas and water barrier, installed at an extra 
cost of about $2 million a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the health dangers hydrogen sulfide poses in air, the gas is 
extremely corrosive to cement and steel when contained in water. The potential 
effect of water on the durability of the $1.45-billion subway is expected to be 
addressed by a panel of three specialists appointed last fall by the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, formed in response to a Times article reporting that numerous 
segments of the tunnels were built with concrete thinner than called for by 
design plans, is expected to announce its findings regarding the soundness of 
the structures within days. Investigations by the FBI and the inspector 
general's office of the U.S. Department of Transportation also were launched. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the smell of sulfur was only faintly noticeable when the Downtown 
subway opened a year ago, the aroma over the past few months has become, for 
some, sickening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you a headache," a train operator said Friday. He is one of several 
people interviewed over the past months who have described symptoms that they 
believe are caused by the hydrogen sulfide. MTA officials said at least one 
train operator has filed a disability claim based on the smell.

ON SHAKY GROUND; COMMERCE: VENTURA BOULEVARD HAS BEEN THE ECONOMIC LIFELINE OF 
THE VALLEY. THE QUAKE DEALT IT ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF JOLTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The trembling of the ground has finally abated, but for shop owners up and 
down this once-busy stretch of Ventura Boulevard, business remains shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than the steady clang of cash registers, they hear the grinding of 
wrecking cranes outside their windows, knocking down office and apartment 
buildings rocked by the Northridge earthquake -- the ones that once created the 
clientele they fear may never be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than half of my business comes from a one-mile radius," said Michael 
Ourieff, owner of Michael J's restaurant. "And now they're gone, they're all 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake has been but the latest disaster to send shock waves along the 
once glitzy San Fernando Valley boulevard, which for years has seen its 
business base rocked by recession, where the "Grand Opening" signs of old have 
slowly been replaced by placards of a different sort: "Going Out of Business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the post-World War II consumer boom, the 17-mile-long commercial stretch 
has run across the Valley floor like an unabated river of retail, representing 
a healthy, buying, vibrant America. It was the Melrose Avenue of the San 
Fernando Valley, a sign that people north of the hill had their own economic, 
cultural and aesthetic centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent years have been hard on the boulevard, where vacancy rates have 
soared and discount stores have popped up in choice locations as rents 
plummeted to as low as $1.25 per square foot, roughly half what was being 
charged before the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as planners developed a vision for refurbishing the retail strip into the 
next century -- a plan to create more parking and pedestrian access to compete 
with nearby malls and other retail drags throughout the Valley -- business 
owners squabbled over how the plan's $222-million price tag would be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as their prized boulevard reels from earthquake damage, politicians, 
business owners and residents are more fearful than ever over the future of the 
traffic-choked thoroughfare known as the Valley's Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 And for good reason. Between Studio City and Woodland Hills, 384 properties 
along Ventura Boulevard suffered more than $41 million in earthquake damage, 
according to a city building and safety report. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sherman Oaks, more than 165 buildings along the boulevard were damaged by 
the temblor -- 19 of them deemed unsafe and another 30 confined to limited 
entry, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura Boulevard got a huge punch in the stomach -- it was knocked out, the 
smelling salts are being taken out all over the place," said Michael Lushing, 
vice president of CB Commercial, a commercial real estate firm. "But it's the 
heart of retail in the Valley -- it can't afford to be out." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reassure shaken businesses, U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. 
Brown took a half-hour tour of quake-beleaguered Ventura Boulevard recently, 
looking at buckled buildings and talking to owners about how they planned to 
bring customers back. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with 40 business owners, Brown promised that the Clinton 
Administration would do what it could to cut bureaucratic red tape and see that 
redevelopment money in the form of grants and loans was rushed to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many owners feel economically adrift, waiting for help they fear may 
never come. "Brown said all the right things," Ourieff said. "Now we just have 
to wait to see if they come true. But the clock is ticking away. A lot of 
people can't wait for the life preserver. They're going down too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at a time when a future vision is most badly needed, the floor has 
literally been pulled out from thousands of white-collar workers who have been 
uprooted by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than a million and a half square feet of commercial office tenants have 
been displaced -- 5% of the entire Valley market -- and another 500,000 square 
feet of small business space was damaged," said Bruce Frasco, senior vice 
president of Beitler Commercial Realty, whose business was forced to moved from 
its 10,000-square-foot Sherman Oaks headquarters into a space one-third the 
size in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 "These tenants are out on the street. And the problem is, for many, that their 
leases are still in effect," Frasco said. "In most cases, the landlord has up 
to a year to rebuild the premises and 90 days just to inform you what he is 
going to do -- tear down the building, or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, many landlords aren't willing to lease to businesses on a 
temporary basis until they can move back into their old haunts. So, people are 
literally out in the cold. They're stuck in limbo. Time has become a killer." 
</P>
<P>
 And many small businesspeople are faced with a conundrum: If they walk away 
from their shops, give them back to the banks, their employees will be back on 
the streets, out of work -- adding to the quake's economic blow to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting with Brown, a Bullock's vice president told him that his retail 
chain would lose $120 million in sales to the earthquake. More startling, he 
said, 300 employees had been laid off from the store's Sherman Oaks location 
and another 300 in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even before last month's temblor, the boulevard was at an economic 
crossroads, experts say -- one that has been made more critical by the recent 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Along one popular stretch between Beverly Glenn and Van Nuys boulevards, six 
of 18 shops sat empty at year's start. Now that blight has been joined by 
earthquake-related eyesores: Broken light poles and cracks in the street and 
plywood covering former window displays. 
</P>
<P>
 There are "Now Leasing" and "Available" signs everywhere on most every block, 
as well as ones that cry "Earthquake menus!" and "Earth-shattering sales!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Look around," said Brain, chairman of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan 
Review Board. "We've lost all the building blocks of a balanced community. 
Malls are damaged. Drugstores abandoned. The only hotel in Sherman Oaks has 
been declared unsafe. Grocery stores and multi-business office buildings -- all 
declared unsafe. A local church is holding Masses in a tent out back. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are wondering what this boulevard and this community are going to 
look like a year from now. Are there going to be deserted lots every other 
blocks? We're praying that doesn't come to pass." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one would dare venture that Ventura Boulevard might benefit from 
the quake, many planners see Brown's promises of financial support as the first 
ray of sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has prompted some merchants to take a closer look at the Ventura 
Boulevard Specific Plan, a broad planning blueprint that aims to upgrade the 
infrastructure of the boulevard and control what residents had complained was 
runaway growth. The estimated cost of the project had been $222 million. Much 
of those funds were to come through "trip fees" assessed to businesses, based 
on how much traffic they generated. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, business owners complained that the fees were too high 
and suggested that other funding sources, perhaps an assessment district, be 
explored. Brain and other merchants have asked the city Planning Commission to 
cut the price tag of the plan to $100 million. The panel agreed to consider the 
proposal.

CITYSCAPES / LAURA GALLOWAY: AFTER MIDNIGHT, WHEN GENERATION X TAKES OVER 
CANTER'S; 'IF YOU MEET A GUY AT CANTER'S, NO MATTER HOW STRANGE HE LOOKS, YOU 
KNOW THAT HE HAS MORALS.' 
</P>

 The flannel shirts are plentiful enough to rival any Midwestern truck stop at 
dawn. Combat boots shine, and pierced body parts are to nighttime patrons what 
mustard is to pastrami sandwiches. At booths and tables, customers flirt, 
klatch and catch up over coffee and knishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Canter's after midnight -- when old-time delicatessen patrons give 
way to Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
 Each weekend, Los Angeles' oldest and most venerated deli undergoes a 
metamorphosis that begins slowly at midnight and gains momentum as the late 
evening turns to early morning. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bars close, weary club-goers in their 20s and 30s come to fill up on 
food and get in a few final hours of schmoozing. After all, where else can one 
get a corned beef on rye, nurse a hangover and feel like part of a Fellini 
film? 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it," says one 25-year-old, clad in a baby-doll dress and oversized 
hat. "This place is where the strangest-looking people come." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mornings and afternoons, the deli is decidedly more staid. The eatery 
is filled with regulars, such as Martin Vimand, who have been coming for the 
food for years. Although he has been a Canter's customer for more than a 
quarter-century, he usually does not venture in after dark, and for good 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little old. I don't go for the real loud noise level. But I have been 
here as late as 10 o'clock," Vimand says over his lunch of chopped liver and 
pastrami. In fact, even the waitresses, known for their crisp pink uniforms and 
in-your-face attitudes, are younger in the late evenings. "(The older 
waitresses) couldn't handle the younger crowd," says Lynn Price, one of the day 
managers at Canter's. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger crowd is not easily categorized. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the grunges, clad in oversize flannel shirts and baggy jeans. There 
are the rockers, who prefer leather to plaid, and those who go undefined, 
including patrons with super-toned bodies and skintight clothing. If they don't 
come to be seen, they come to scam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come to look at the girls, and sometimes to look at the strange people," 
says Peter Corey, an aspiring screenwriter who had ordered a martini extra dry 
and a bowl of matzo ball soup. His friend, Bryce McDonald, a movie producer, 
agrees. "It's kind of like bird-watching," he says. "Except in this case, the 
later the better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Always, there is the chance for love. Once, says a female patron, a man with a 
Harley-Davidson jacket sent her a barrage of poems written on paper napkins. 
When she excused herself from the table to go reapply her lipstick, he followed 
her to the restroom. Phone numbers were exchanged and the pair dated for three 
months. "If you meet a guy at Canter's, no matter how strange he looks, you 
know that he has morals," she says knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Many attribute the success of the deli as an after-hours nightspot not only to 
the colorful clientele, but to the location on Fairfax Avenue, central to many 
clubs and bars that are in vogue. It doesn't hurt, either, that the eatery is 
open 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really relaxing. There's a very diverse crowd here," says a 24-year-old 
band manager who goes by the name Jenz. "We usually come from a club all the 
time because it's still open." Jenz, who has a streak of purple running through 
her raven hair, is clearly not here for the deli fare. The vegetarian has 
ordered coffee and a bowl of pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 Bella Haig, the night manager of the deli and a 30-year Canter's employee, 
says the influx of young people is nothing new. "I've been through the hippie 
generation, then the Hell's Angels, then the punkers. The lines have been so 
long that the windows used to break from people leaning on them," Haig says. It 
was around that time that private security guards had to be hired. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, potentially volatile situations are handled by Jack Baker, 
Canter's 83-year-old, one-man security force. Baker mostly patrols the booths, 
working on noise control and occasionally asking customers who sit cross-legged 
to put their feet on the floor. "It rips the vinyl, you know. Especially big 
high heels." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker has seen quite a lot of heels in his 48 years at Canter's. "You'll see 
guys dressed like girls, and they're good-looking!" he says incredulously. "In 
the old days, we had all the old people. Now you've got this young stuff coming 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the deli's nighttime patrons readily admit it is uncool to be 
star-struck, the frequent appearance of Hollywood notables has proved to be yet 
another draw. "All the Jewish comics come here," says McDonald, ticking off a 
list of sightings that could make a tabloid journalist salivate. 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians often take part in impromptu jam sessions in the Kibbitz Room, a bar 
that adjoins the deli and features live music by local bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tova Oppenheim, a hostess at Canter's, readily admits that all her 
idols are "in Palm Springs and semi-retired," she lights up when she mentions 
the fact that she has seen members of the rock group Guns N' Roses and cast 
members of the daytime soap "The Young and the Restless" in the deli.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here four glorious years," she says. "And the best thing about this 
place is really the people -- the variety of people."

PLAN OKD FOR CITY WORKERS TO OVERSEE QUAKE-RELATED DEMOLITION PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday won approval of a plan to have the 
demolition of hundreds of earthquake-damaged buildings managed by city workers 
instead of by private contractors who he said would charge twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's victory in a vote before the City Council represented a change in 
attitude for Riordan, the Republican who campaigned on a pledge to turn many 
government jobs over to private firms and called city bureaucrats "brain-dead." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, three liberal Democratic council members, who have been 
champions of municipal employees, criticized the city's Bureau of Engineering 
and said private contractors could do the job for less. They lost in a 10-3 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "This demonstrates my commitment to support the most cost-effective way to 
accomplish the public's work, whether we use public employees or private 
contractors, when appropriate," Riordan said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted to place 79 workers from the city's Bureau of 
Engineering into a new Earthquake Recovery Division, which will oversee 
demolition of up to 1,000 buildings. The public employees will award contracts 
to private firms that will raze the buildings and haul away debris. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bureau of Engineering estimated that city workers can do the job for $5.8 
million, compared to $12.3 million that three private partnerships would have 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer Robert Horii said the city can do the work for less because it 
has lower overhead costs and will not factor in a 10% profit margin like the 
private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Horii said the shift to city oversight became possible when the estimated 
number of buildings to be demolished dropped from 10,000 to a maximum of 1,000. 
Officials said they expect at least half to be demolished by owners or 
insurance companies, leaving 500 for the city to destroy. 
</P>
<P>
 With the scope of the work greatly reduced, Riordan Administration officials 
said the final stumbling block to public oversight was whether the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency would reimburse the city for its costs. Regulations 
had limited such payments to prevent cities from propping up city personnel 
costs with emergency funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan called federal budget Director Leon E. Panetta and wrote FEMA 
Director James L. Witt this week to ask for a waiver of regulations. Witt 
agreed to the waiver Thursday because of the projected savings of $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Richard Alatorre noted that city officials had estimated what 
the private contractors would charge instead of allowing the companies to 
submit bids. "Everything depends on us being able to do it cheaper and better," 
he said. "Let's test it. Let's see." 
</P>
<P>
 But his request to give the firms more time to present a counterproposal was 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 George Pla, owner of one of the companies considered for the work, said the 
private firms would have presented lower bids if they had been given a chance. 
"Since when, in the history of the world, does government do something cheaper 
than the private sector?" Pla asked in an interview. "I'd like to know if 
anyone can cite an example." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan had said earlier in the week in an appearance before the League of 
Women Voters that a proposal to have three private partnerships handle the 
oversight work was "a pork barrel" that would benefit "a lot of friends of 
politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan declined to identify the politicians or elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre has ties to four firms that were among about a dozen initially 
recommended for the lucrative contracts. Pla is a political ally and he once 
employed Alatorre's son. Another firm is headed by a former campaign manager 
and a third by a former Alatorre chief of staff. The fourth company supported 
the councilman politically. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre said his connections to the firms had nothing to do with his support 
of private contracting. He said he simply believed that the private companies 
could oversee the work more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 Only council members Richard Alarcon and Mike Hernandez voted with Alatorre 
against the public oversight proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon and Hernandez said they wanted to ensure that the work was done for 
the lowest cost. They also said private contractors would be more effective at 
recruiting minority-owned firms to do the demolition.

OFFICERS GOT GOOD REVIEWS AFTER ALLEGED INCIDENTS; LAPD: PERSONNEL RECORDS 
REVEAL SUPERVISORS GAVE THE TWO GLOWING EVALUATIONS AFTER ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY 
HARASSED FEMALE COLLEAGUES.

<P>
 Two Los Angeles police officers at the center of a massive LAPD sexual 
harassment inquiry received glowing performance evaluations after incidents in 
which they allegedly mistreated female colleagues, copies of personnel records 
obtained by The Times reveal. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1993, Officer Jay A. Varga was given strong ratings in 22 of 28 
categories and was not found to need improvement in any area. The report called 
his work exemplary and credited him with enjoying the respect and trust of 
community leaders, including a homeowners association president and City 
Councilman Marvin Braude, whose district Varga patrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 But those laudatory reports stand in stark contrast to allegations that Varga 
and another officer, Stephen M. McNicholas, made sexist and racist remarks and 
failed to come to the aid of female officers who were in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a copy of the personnel complaint filed against them, Varga and 
McNicholas made sexist remarks on a number of occasions -- allegedly referring 
to a police car containing two female officers as a "bitch car." 
</P>
<P>
 The personnel complaint was completed Oct. 25, 1993, while the audit of the 
West Los Angeles station was under way. It details eight instances of allegedly 
improper comments or actions by McNicholas or Varga in 1990 and 1991. In one 
case, Varga allegedly told a female officer, Paget Mitchell, that "blacks are 
subhumans, blacks can't write and have no capability of learning, and I don't 
want to work with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Varga allegedly made that comment in early 1990. Mitchell also told 
investigators that Varga failed to come to her aid when she was battling a 
combative suspect at the West Los Angeles jail. Mitchell declined to comment on 
the investigation Friday, but she said the allegations in the report were true. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McNicholas also was accused of failing to assist a female officer as she 
struggled with a suspect in the back of a police car. Gary Fullerton, a 
director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which is backing the two 
officers, said the allegation was "totally false." 
</P>
<P>
 Another allegation against McNicholas accuses him of telling a female officer: 
"No white man would want to rape a black woman because they are too ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory G. Petersen, a lawyer who represents Varga and McNicholas, angrily 
rejected every one of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department has not provided me with any formal charges against my 
clients," Petersen said. "But the allegations, as described to me by (a 
reporter), are untrue, unfounded, unsubstantiated and grossly unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity between the comments attributed to the officers in the personnel 
complaint and their glowing performance evaluations bothered some observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe what this is showing is that we need a whole new way of evaluating 
officers," said City Councilwoman Laura Chick, a member of the Public Safety 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick and some other observers commended the LAPD for conducting a massive 
investigation into the sexual harassment allegations at the West Los Angeles 
station, a police division that has long been accused of allowing hostility 
toward women. The LAPD audit, which is nearly complete, took four months and 
involved interviews with more than 100 officers in West Los Angeles, according 
to sources familiar with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But leaders of the Police Protective League called a news conference Friday in 
which they criticized the department for its inquiry, accusing LAPD officials 
of slanting the investigation to bolster the charges against Varga and 
McNicholas. Danny L. Staggs, the league's president, also said that the union 
"resents the fact the 250 officers and supervisors (at West Los Angeles) have 
been branded" as tolerating an environment that is hostile to women. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Department observers and critics delivered sharply different 
assessments of the West Los Angeles station and its reputation as a difficult 
place for women to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Paulette Herman, a day watch commander at West Los Angeles and president 
of the Los Angeles Women Police Officers Assn., told City News Service that 
"believe me, if sexual harassment was going on at West L.A. right now, I would 
be very sensitive and aware of it, and it's just not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Herman was assigned to West Los Angeles after the investigation was under way. 
A source familiar with the LAPD internal investigation said harassment at the 
station has virtually stopped since the inquiry was launched last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Spillar, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation and a 
co-chairwoman of the Women's Advisory Council to the Police Commission, said 
West Los Angeles has earned its reputation as a hostile environment for female 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been so many complaints out of that division," Spillar said. "It's a 
cesspool." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how the LAPD investigation came to be initiated remains a mystery, as 
department officials say there was no specific complaint of misconduct. Police 
union leaders doubt that, and say the investigation was intended to build a 
case against Varga and McNicholas. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two officers were first transferred out of West Los Angeles last year, 
but they went to court to block the transfer. It was after they filed suit that 
the allegations of sexual harassment came to light, according to department 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen and leaders of the police union say the timing is no coincidence, but 
rather bolsters their contention that the LAPD was out to punish Varga and 
McNicholas. The officers echo that argument, and laid out their case in an Aug. 
9, 1993, letter to Deputy Mayor William Violante, a former police union 
president who serves in the Administration of Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 In that letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Times on Friday, Varga 
asked Violante to launch an inquiry into the department's efforts to transfer 
him and McNicholas. Varga requested that the investigation be handled by the 
civilian Police Commission because he doubted the integrity of LAPD management. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Varga said questions about him were first raised in early 1993 
after an officer at the West Los Angeles station reported "perceived 
mistreatment" to a supervisor. That officer's complaint ultimately sparked what 
Varga described as a "clandestine investigation" overseen by Deputy Chief 
Ronald A. Frankle. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Varga, that investigation involved interviews with about 40 
female officers, who were asked leading questions about officers and 
supervisors in the West Los Angeles police station. Varga said in his letter 
that commanders put together a hit list based on those interviews, and soon 
began transferring the officers on that list to other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But when commanders attempted to transfer Varga and McNicholas, they objected, 
saying they had a right to see any material that had been gathered against 
them. Commanders at first insisted there was not an administrative 
investigation under way, but later admitted that they had polled female staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the personnel complaint against Varga and McNicholas lists a number 
of charges against the officers, more may be brought against them or other 
officers, police sources said. The audit is nearly complete, and its results 
are being forwarded to the department's Internal Affairs Division, which will 
consider whether the allegations of misconduct warrant disciplinary hearings.

GUNMAN WHO SHOT POLICE OFFICERS TRIED TO JOIN LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David J. Fukuto, the gunman who shot two Palos Verdes Estates police officers 
to death this week, was so enraptured with the world of guns and law 
enforcement that he sought to become a Los Angeles police officer shortly after 
the 1992 riots, according to city personnel records and the account of a close 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he wanted to try to do some good," said the friend, who shared 
Fukuto's passion for guns and often went target shooting with him. "Everybody 
wants to take the bad guys off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuto, 32, who died in the still unexplained attack at a motivational seminar 
for Palos Verdes Estates police officers and city officials, passed the Los 
Angeles Police Department's written exam in June, 1992, and scored a 93 out of 
100 on the oral exam a month later, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuto's scores were considered outstanding, but the self-employed life 
insurance agent did not take subsequent tests or land a job because of a 
partial hiring freeze and a flood of applicants with Gulf War military 
experience, a city personnel department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's hiring rules, veterans of Operation Desert Storm are given a 
five-point bonus on the police oral exam, enabling some applicants to score 
above 100. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did very well, but it was kind of cutthroat," said Diana Britt, assistant 
chief of the department's Police and Fire Selection Division. "I doubt they 
hired anyone that year who scored under 98." 
</P>
<P>
 Britt said candidates -- particularly minority applicants, who are typically 
in high demand -- are encouraged to retake the oral exam every three months to 
improve their scores, but Fukuto -- who was Japanese American -- mysteriously 
dropped out and never tried again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lea Cherry, spokeswoman for the California Commission on Police Officer 
Standards and Training, which sets regulations for police agencies statewide, 
said there was no record that Fukuto had received any formal police training or 
had applied to other police departments, although she said the agency would 
know only about applications that resulted in official training. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hermosa Beach police officer, serving Friday as desk officer at the Palos 
Verdes Estates Police Department, said the department was consumed with funeral 
plans for the two slain officers and did not know if Fukuto had ever applied 
for a job there. A Palos Verdes Estates city employee, who asked not to be 
identified, said openings in the 23-member Police Department are rare and 
competition is intense. Last year, the employee said, the city was deluged with 
more than 300 applications for a civilian job in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the close friend who attends Fukuto's Mid-City Los Angeles 
church, Fukuto took the LAPD rejection "with a grain of salt" and never spoke 
of a grudge against law enforcement. The friend said being a cop "wasn't on the 
top of his agenda," but rather a visceral reaction to the lawlessness that 
followed the state verdicts in the Rodney G. King beating trial in the spring 
of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he talked of anything it was getting even with gangbangers or drug 
dealers, but not with cops," said the friend, who refused to be identified out 
of respect to Fukuto's family. "I think everyone has some sort of fantasy about 
being a cop and he probably did too, but I don't think he had an obsession." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Fukuto gradually had grown more concerned over the years about 
issues of personal safety and self-defense, once taking a course at El Camino 
College in defense tactics and later moving to the Mid-City home of his widowed 
grandmother out of fear for her safety in the sometimes dangerous neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Father John Yamazaki, pastor emeritus of St. Mary's Church, where Fukuto was a 
member of the board and was honored for his church service the night before the 
Torrance killings, said Fukuto went searching for his elderly grandmother after 
she wandered off to watch the looting during the riots. Friends said the riots 
convinced Fukuto that Los Angeles was a dangerous place to live, and that 
residents had to be responsible for their own well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 One source who asked not to be identified said the bulletproof vest Fukuto 
wore during the Monday attack had been loaned to him by a friend last year. The 
source said Fukuto feared that the federal verdicts in the King beating trial 
would lead to more rioting, and he wanted to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believed that guns were not evil, that it was the people behind them," one 
friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to friends and acquaintances, Fukuto had a longtime fascination with 
guns and law and order, something he made no attempt to hide. Police found an 
extensive gun and ammunition collection at Fukuto's home, including at least 13 
pistols, three rifles and two shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
 The close friend said Fukuto received his first rifle from his father, state 
District Court of Appeal Justice Morio Fukuto, who, in his only statement about 
the killings, described his son's actions as terrible and unforgivable and said 
he could offer no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just an adventurer type, a gun collector, a shooter," said one friend 
who grew up in Fukuto's childhood neighborhood in Torrance and played 
paint-ball war games with him in the early 1980s. "He was involved in street 
racing, and shooting and hunting. He was pretty well-liked." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper Rafu Shimpo, which serves the Japanese American community in Los 
Angeles, reported this week that Fukuto had an hourlong debate over gun control 
with an acquaintance last Sunday, the day before he killed Capt. Michael Tracy, 
50, and Sgt. Vernon Thomas Vanderpool, 57, on the 12th floor of the Torrance 
Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting an unidentified source, the newspaper said Fukuto insisted "we need 
guns to protect ourselves" and at times raised his voice during the debate. The 
newspaper also said an unidentified source saw Fukuto wearing a blue uniform 
shortly after graduating from North High School in Torrance. "I remember 
laughing at him in his blue uniform and black gloves. I think he was trying to 
be a cop," the newspaper quoted the source.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
COUNCIL LIFTS HIRING FREEZE ON 80 LIBRARY JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council lifted a hiring freeze on 80 library jobs Friday 
so the city's libraries can continue to stay open six days a week.  
</P>
<P>
 The hiring will also allow officials to maintain children's programs, homework 
centers, literacy tutoring and other essential services.Librarians, clerks and 
support workers will be hired, but 25 other positions will remain unfilled. 
Most city agencies have been operating under a hiring freeze for three years as 
a budget-cutting measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously and without comment to authorize the new hiring, 
despite City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie's recommendation not to 
approve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other departments, the library system has absorbed funding cuts in recent 
years, including a 25% reduction in its budget for new books and materials. 
Mayor Richard Riordan wants increased private donations and use of volunteers 
to fill the gap.

 Trojangate (cont'd.): It's no shock that just-resigned Assemblyman Pat Nolan, 
who struck a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to a political corruption 
charge, attended USC. After all, the school has a long history of what 
euphemistically might be called hard-nosed politics, producing such famous 
names as Watergate figures H.R. Haldeman, Dwight L. Chapin, Ronald Ziegler and 
Donald H. Segretti. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, USC politics has been marked by such dirty tricks as the 
secret taping of opponents' conversations, the sprinkling of manure around 
polling places, the theft of school newspapers containing election endorsements 
and ballot box stuffing that caused one election to be invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Student Supreme Court has entered into the spirit of the high jinks, 
once convening secret sessions in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest you think that no white hats practiced politics at USC we should point 
out that another grad is county Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow we find it reassuring that Garcetti was defeated when he ran for 
student body president.

 Memories of a tarnished diamond: Caltrans' announcement that it may implement 
a permanent diamond lane when Santa Monica Freeway II opens may stir 
nightmarish memories for natives of L.A. (By natives, we mean anyone who has 
lived here 20 years or seen the movie "To Live and Die in L.A.") 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans tried it once before in the mid-1970s and the result was huge traffic 
jams, many caused by drivers entering the freeway and trying to move over to 
the car-pool lane. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there were disputes over whether it was fair to count kids as 
passengers. (Everyone agreed that the guy transporting mannequins was in the 
wrong.) 
</P>
<P>
 But a high school classmate of ours has pleasant memories of that brief 
experiment. He would stand near an off-ramp in West L.A. each morning and offer 
to ride with solo motorists for $20. 
</P>
<P>
 When people asked him what he did for a living, he would respond: "I'm in the 
diamond business." 
</P>

 But enough about driving: Let's talk about parking. It's tough enough to find 
a spot these days. But Wanda Estes sent us a photo of a lot in Whittier that 
seems to require customers to take an IQ test.

 We Kind of Love L.A.: Winifred Meiser of Thousand Oaks isn't about to give up 
on L.A., as she illustrated with the bumper sticker she sent us.

 That got us to thinking that perhaps it's time for songwriter Randy Newman to 
adjust the lyrics to his ode to the City of Angels. 
</P>

 In case you were wondering, today's photo was taken in the lot of the Bright

 Nearly 50 years after fighting on behalf of the United States during World War 
II, Filipino native Estanislao Bargas Beloy, 72, thought he was finally about 
to win his long battle for American citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when the retired Manila dentist arrived in Los Angeles to take 
advantage of a 1990 immigration law extending citizenship rights to Filipino 
World War II veterans, he ran into a brick wall -- namely, that the U.S. Army 
had no record on file of his service with a guerrilla artillery unit near 
Luzon. 
</P>
<P>
 Beloy, one of thousands of Filipino veterans whose military papers were 
apparently destroyed or lost during or after the Japanese occupation of what 
was then a U.S. colony, was among more than 300 Filipino World War II soldiers 
attending a prayer and protest vigil Friday outside the Federal Building in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The elderly veterans, most of whom have become American citizens as a result 
of the 1990 law, were demanding pension and disability benefits equal to those 
granted American war veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fought side by side with the Americans," said Los Angeles resident David 
Sarbilla. "We want equal benefits too." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired U.S. Army Col. Edwin Ramsey, who led World War II guerrilla forces in 
central Luzon, called the lack of benefits reprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for the loyalty and patriotic support 
of the Filipinos during World War II," said Ramsey, a speaker at the rally. 
"The tragedy is that Americans don't appreciate that before the war there were 
18 million Filipinos and after the war there were 17 million. Most would not 
have died if they had accepted the Japanese and turned against the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The morning protest coincided with the anniversary of a 1946 federal act that 
rescinded the rights of Filipinos who fought alongside American soldiers. In 
1941, then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an order incorporating the 
Philippine armed forces into the U.S. military and pledging citizenship to 
Filipinos who took up arms against the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) recently reported that fewer than half 
of the estimated 60,000 veterans who were expected to file for naturalization 
since passage of the 1990 law have actually applied. Pelosi has introduced 
federal legislation to allow Filipinos to use military service records 
authenticated by the Philippine government since many American records were 
lost or later destroyed in a fire at the U.S. processing center. 
</P>
<P>
 Although federal judges have ruled in favor of veterans with substitute papers 
in several court cases, federal Immigration and Naturalization Service 
officials, fearing the potential of fraud, have appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The INS is simply required by law to (only) accept certification by the U.S. 
Army," said Joe Korvisky, a Department of Justice spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Filipino war veterans granted citizenship qualify for Social Security and 
health benefits and can also bring their families to the United States 
permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill sponsored by Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) also would extend full 
U.S. military pension and disability benefits to all Filipino World War II 
veterans, a measure that analysts have said would result in a $1-billion-plus 
annual price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, Filipinos are generally entitled to limited service-connected 
disability compensation, life insurance, burial plots and burial flags, 
according to the Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington. They do not 
qualify for pensions, non-service-connected hospitalization or outpatient 
treatment, or a headstone for their graves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That is just not fair to the nearly 700,000 people of Filipino origin in 
California, protesters contend. There are more Filipinos in the state than in 
any other area outside the Pacific Ocean archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought in Bataan, I fought in Corregidor; we surrendered under Gen. 
(Jonathan) Wainwright," said Ceferino Carino, 77, who traveled to the rally 
from San Diego, where his three sons serve in the U.S. Navy. "I've been 
interviewed for citizenship, I've done everything." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carino, who holds a permanent immigrant visa, said he has yet to receive a 
ruling since his name is not on record at the Army's records center in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Beloy, who hopes to bring his two children to Long Beach from Saudi Arabia 
where they work as dentists, has hired a lawyer to help prove his claim of 
military service by using Philippine Army records. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never lost hope," said the lanky, freckled septuagenarian, who was 
wearing a white-and-yellow baseball cap. "I just keep on waiting because I am 
hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if the INS says no, I will feel disgusted," he added.

AL MARTINEZ: LIFE ON PLANET FANTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have a friend who sits on a hilltop at night, closes her eyes and attempts 
to make contact with unidentified flying objects through mental telepathy. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a sweet lady who told me about this after we attended a secret meeting 
of a private organization called the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial 
Intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 As I understand it, she has not made contact yet but believes that someday she 
will. It is part of a CSEI project called coherent thought sequencing, in which 
meditation is employed to facilitate getting in touch with whoever is out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 I say the meeting was secret because the organization's leader, Dr. Steven 
Greer, an emergency room physician from North Carolina, doesn't think the world 
is ready to know what he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows, for instance, that extraterrestrials are prepared to meet with us, 
that Washington is hiding the bodies of E.T.s killed in a crash and that CSEI 
needs $7 million in donations to continue making friends with the folks from 
Alpha Centauri. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need your love and we need your money," is the way the wife of folk singer 
Burl Ives put it. Ives and actor Eddie Albert were celebrities-in-attendance at 
the meeting, though I'm certain there are many more who belong to CSEI. Actors 
dwell in outer space most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The lady-who-sits-on-a-hilltop invited me to the session and at first asked me 
to sign a non-disclosure form. I said I wouldn't, so she said what the hey, 
come anyhow. I doubt if the woman has ever said hell in her life, though she 
probably wishes now I would go there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was held on Planet Earth at the Portofino Hotel in Redondo Beach. 
About 150 true believers gathered to hear Greer and others discuss the 
extraterrestrials they have seen or heard about. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer founded CSEI four years ago and claims 600 members. Its headquarters are 
in Asheville, N.C., where a lot of good old boys have no doubt had close 
encounters of many kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of the session, slides and home videotapes were shown to 
prove the existence of people from outer space who are visiting this planet. 
</P>
<P>
 They are pictures you have seen before on "Unsolved Mysteries" and "In Search 
Of . . . ": scratches of illumination across distant horizons, and blobs of 
light or shadow that hover in the sky like irregularities on outdated film. 
</P>
<P>
 The most unique photograph was that of a light blob over a man feeding beer to 
his horse in Colorado, although there was no indication that either the man or 
the horse were aware of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the audience were so moved by the blobs they applauded. At first it 
appeared that at least three people had either died or fainted from the 
excitement, but it became clear later that they had simply dozed off. 
</P>
<P>
 By Greer's estimate, there have been hundreds of close encounters with UFOs 
and extraterrestrials since 1947. Then why, I hear you ask, hasn't anyone taken 
pictures of the incidents, other than those photos of distant blobs? 
</P>
<P>
 It is because, Greer explained, cameras mysteriously fail to operate up close 
to aliens and their spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A psychologist, a former NASA scientist and a man who created his own think 
tank were among the, well, experts who believe we are about to shake hands or 
claws or other forms of protuberances with space aliens and ought to prepare 
for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 If the presence of these experts was meant to establish credibility, it failed 
as far as I'm concerned. Forty years as a journalist teaches you can gather 
scientists to swear they've seen fairies dancing on the lawn if there's enough 
money or glory in it. Some even believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 The "secret" part of the meeting, by the way, involved something called 
"Project Starlight," which included a timetable for contacting first the 
extraterrestrials and then CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 "From now on, please don't talk about what you see or hear," Greer said, after 
which he announced that $7 million would be necessary to finance "Project 
Starlight" and that it might include a rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, OK. I think there's probably something out there all right. It ain't 
swamp gas. I mean, Ives' wife, Dolores, was bathed once in a warming beam of 
light she calls her cosmic angel, and others have dined with E.T.s on tasty 
portions of tinted air. How can I not believe? 
</P>
<P>
 But if I were the lady-who-sits-on-a-hilltop, I wouldn't donate my estate to 
any organization that either believes the end of the world is near or the day 
of extraterrestrial contact is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus and E.T. may be coming, but they're not going to demand entrance fees or 
a table of organization to let us know about it.

MELEE ERUPTS BETWEEN BLACK, LATINO STUDENTS; VIOLENCE: MOUNTING RACIAL TENSIONS 
LEAD TO LUNCHTIME BRAWL AT PARAMOUNT HIGH. A FEW MINOR INJURIES ARE REPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

correspondent; Merl is a Times education writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A week of mounting racial tensions between blacks and Latinos at Paramount 
High School erupted into a lunch-period melee involving hundreds of students 
Friday, sheriff's deputies and school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few minor injuries were reported, and there were no immediate arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of sheriff's deputies helped school staff get students back into their 
classrooms, where they were held until they could be escorted off campus. About 
1,000 refused to leave, however, keeping the deputies on campus until about 
4:40 p.m., according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman 
Angie McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of parents, alerted by the commotion and a sheriff's helicopter 
circling above the 3,100-student campus on South Downey Avenue, flocked to the 
high school and the elementary campus across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Elseia Uhleirra arrived to pick up her daughter, Martha, a ninth-grader. "My 
daughter said there is a lot of racial tension here," Uhleirra said. "She said 
things have been getting really bad this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Unified School District officials confirmed there had been tensions 
between the high school's 2,300 Latino students and its 500 black students this 
week but said Friday's brawl involved far fewer students -- perhaps 30 to 50 in 
the initial fight. 
</P>
<P>
 A large crowd formed around the melee, and deputies were called when the 
students would not disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said no weapons were involved. Students will be interviewed 
when classes resume Tuesday to determine whether there will be any suspensions, 
district spokeswoman Norma Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Bruce Cantley, who assumed the post two weeks ago, referred all 
questions to the district office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz said tensions between the two groups had been building since midweek and 
extra administrators were sent to the high school Friday morning. One student 
said there was a fight Tuesday or Wednesday when a Latino grabbed a necklace 
from a black student. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's melee began near the end of the lunch period, when someone pulled a 
fire alarm and a group of students turned over a couple of trash cans, Ortiz 
said. Others then started running around the campus and refused to go back to 
their classrooms. It was then that sheriff's deputies were called, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sophomore identified only as Juan watched much of the melee from his biology 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were just throwing trash cans and just standing around," he said. "I 
could hardly get to my classroom. But nobody was really fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has several efforts under way to promote racial harmony, 
including multicultural activities. Ortiz said there had been no serious 
incidents until Friday, but some students said tensions had been high for quite 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
 With Friday's brawl, Paramount joined a growing list of Los Angeles-area 
schools that have faced racial fights and other problems recently. In November, 
police were called to Pomona High School to help quell several fights, a day 
after nine were arrested in fights at Jordan High School in Long Beach.

CONGREGATIONS JOIN RISING CHORUS IN CALL FOR UPDATED MUSIC; HYMNS: 'WHY DO WE 
INSIST THAT NORTH AMERICAN WORSHIP BE 19TH-CENTURY NORTHERN EUROPEAN?,' ONE 
CHURCH OFFICIAL ASKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Roll over, Handel. Take a step back, John Wesley. Make room in the choir for 
Hank and Dolly and Whoopi. 
</P>
<P>
 In the world of church music, where it is difficult for living composers to 
break into denominational hymnals, a growing chorus of voices is being raised 
for incorporating contemporary music into worship. 
</P>
<P>
 United Methodist scholar Tex Sample, in a speech last month at Emory 
University's Candler School of Theology, said country music is the soul music 
of millions of working-class people and should find its place in liturgies that 
reflect the lives of people in the pews. 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Francis of Assisi Episcopal Church in Novato, Calif., anything from 
reggae music to a selection from the musical "Les Miserables" may be heard in 
the Sunday family service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do we insist that North American worship be 19th-Century Northern 
European? What if we were to use some authentic trappings of American culture?" 
the Rev. Philip Lyon Rountree Jr., the church rector, asked in an article last 
year in the periodical Congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of contemporary music say most church music, even such hymns as "A 
Mighty Fortress Is Our God," had their origins as folk songs. If you want to 
reach today's audiences with a religious message, this generation should be 
given the same freedom to adapt contemporary music to liturgical uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory works well in the movies. In "Sister Act," neighborhood people 
flocked in off the streets after the character played by Whoopi Goldberg livens 
up the music at the Catholic church she is hiding out in. 
</P>
<P>
 Even critics agree that church music should not be entirely other-worldly. 
What they insist, however, is that music directors choose the finest of the 
liturgical tradition, not rush out to perform Billy Ray Cyrus' "Achy Breaky 
Heart" in the processional because it is at the top of the charts that week. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to take the best and the most noble in a culture, and just not go to 
the least common denominator," said Thomas Day, author of "Why Catholics Can't 
Sing." 
</P>
<P>
 Day, chairman of the music department at Salve Regina College in Newport, 
R.I., sees in the rush to contemporary music "a hidden agenda" that has more to 
do with the "tremendous egos" of clergy and soloists than liturgical reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In traditional worship settings, with the organ playing and the congregation 
singing, the song is a form of communal worship that plays an important part in 
the service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, when they're up there singing 'On Eagle's Wings' or even a nice song 
like 'Amazing Grace,' there's always someone up there with the spotlight on 
them and to hell with the congregation," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 But proponents of contemporary music say it is the traditionalists who have 
turned a deaf ear to the pews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a question of giving up 'the word,' if you will. It's a question of 
'the word' being indigenous," Sample said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as religious leaders can find valuable teaching material in biblical 
accounts of killing, lying and adultery, so can they find "great grist for the 
mill" in country music amid the contradictions of suffering and redemption, 
hope and hopelessness, Sample said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, Johnny Paycheck's "Take This Job and Shove It" talks 
about the suffering of people who keep jobs they hate in order to pay the 
bills. Kris Kristofferson's "Sunday Morning Coming Down" speaks about the need 
to have enough meaning in one's life to make it through the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfaction does not come through a job or casual sexual relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes love pretty important," Sample said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Episcopal Church near San Francisco, Rountree found one reason young 
people were not regular churchgoers was that they considered church music 
morose and depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rountree observed that there was something amiss in efforts to attract 
worshipers in California with services dependent on British culture and several 
centuries of Northern European organ music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, the people were simply not coming to church, or they would come 
once," he said. "I began to think, 'What's more important here, preserving the 
culture or giving people access to the Gospel?"' 
</P>
<P>
 The church added a third service on Sundays featuring contemporary music from 
folk, contemporary Christian, gospel music and other sources, including some 
traditional hymns. Within six months, he said, the service was full or nearly 
full every Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 When he started the service in 1987, the service was considered a daring 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years later, he said, "it's very much like their traditional religion 
right now."

COURT BECOMES ARBITER IN CLASH BETWEEN SEXUAL REVOLUTION, RELIGION; 
DISCRIMINATION LAWS: BROTHERS CITE THEIR BELIEFS IN DEFENDING REFUSAL TO RENT 
TO UNMARRIED COUPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A high court in Massachusetts has become an arbiter in a culture clash pitting 
religion against the sexual revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that bears resemblance to others around the country, two Catholic 
brothers are facing charges of discrimination because they refused to rent an 
apartment to an unmarried couple. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers say they were following their religious beliefs, but the state 
says their rental business doesn't qualify as a religious activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Catholicism is not on trial here, but (the brothers') strongly held religious 
convictions are," said Jay Sekulow, counsel for the American Center for Law and 
Justice, a Virginia group founded by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which is representing the landlords, Paul and Ronald Desilets, 
presented arguments last week before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikolas Nikas, another attorney with the Virginia group, said the landlords 
were justified in refusing to go against their religion. He also noted that 
fornication is still against the law in Massachusetts, although authorities say 
it is rarely, if ever, enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commonwealth is attempting to force the Desilets to violate their 
sincerely held religious beliefs," Nikas said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judith Beals, an assistant attorney general, said the landlords are 
engaged in a commercial activity, not a form of worship that is protected under 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The landlords have not shown how the government has restrained them in their 
religious worship," Beals told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar cases have arisen in other states. In 1990, the Minnesota Supreme 
Court ruled in favor of a landlord who also refused to rent to an unmarried 
couple because of his religious beliefs. In California, the state Court of 
Appeal sided with a landlord, but the state Supreme Court last year refused to 
make a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wisconsin last year, a state judge ruled that a woman violated open housing 
laws by placing an ad for a "Christian handyman" to rent a room in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Such cases evoke different views of how far religious liberties should extend. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne-Marie Amiel, an attorney with the Rutherford Institute, an organization 
that specializes in religious civil liberties, said that if people rent out 
rooms in their homes, "they should be allowed to choose who they want under 
their own roof." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said that if someone owns a string of rental properties, "you are 
basically a commercial landlord. The (fair housing) laws apply to you." 
</P>
<P>
 A federal law passed last year, called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 
prevents any form of government from interfering with a person's exercise of 
religious freedom unless it can show a "compelling" interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some religious groups say the law bolsters the case of landlords such as the 
Desilets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the government has a legitimate interest in ensuring open housing, it 
has a variety of tools to achieve that goal without having to "run roughshod 
over the religious liberties of others," said Brent Walker, general counsel for 
the Baptist Joint Committee, which focuses on religious liberty issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts sided against the landlords in the 
case now before the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We care a lot about free exercise of religion," said Sarah Wunsch, an 
attorney with the organization. "What the landlords want goes way beyond what 
anyone considers free exercise of religion." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she said a small community where most residents share the same 
religious beliefs could essentially screen the people who live in the local 
rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Massachusetts, the state sued the Desilets after they turned away a young 
couple in 1989 from an apartment in the small western Massachusetts town of 
Turners Falls. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, Mark Lattanzi and Cynthia Tarail, had seen the apartment 
advertised in a newspaper. But Paul Desilets asked Tarail whether the couple 
planned to get married, and when she said no, he turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court papers, Desilets told Tarail: "I don't go for that living 
in sin stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 A Franklin County Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the landlords in 
1992, citing their religious rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Beals charged that the brothers violated the state's fair housing law, which 
prohibits discrimination based on marital status. She said that law recognizes 
the rights of unmarried couples, despite the statute against fornication.

IMPORTANCE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS GROWS AS AMERICANS AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE H. GALLUP JR. and ROBERT BEZILLA, Princeton Religion Research Center 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As we grow older, our energy, sex drive, memory, income, health and physical 
senses usually enter a state of gradual decline. But religious belief -- and 
the comfort and happiness it provides -- increases with age for most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some religious organizations even formalize the process of leadership by their 
older members by giving them the title "elders," and for good reason: As people 
mature, more often than not, they attach more importance to religion and step 
up their participation in the affairs of organized church life at all levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the young in this country, belief levels are high, with nearly all 
people believing in God or a universal spirit. But such beliefs are not always 
translated into actions until later in life, as the sense of identity with 
organized religion increases and the focus upon God in this life and the life 
hereafter becomes sharper. 
</P>
<P>
 As Americans grow older, they make firmer choices in religious preference, 
attend religious activities more often, and think more about how they have led 
their lives. For nearly every dimension of religious life we have surveyed over 
the years, an increase generally is found as people mature. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall sense of the importance of religion clearly increases as people 
grow older. More than two in three (69%) 50- to 64-year-olds say religion is 
very important in their lives, and three of every four people 65 and older feel 
this way.  
</P>
<P>
 Only 8% of the population maintain through their senior years that religion is 
unimportant in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 These feelings of importance are not just a state of mind but usually are 
translated into increased involvement in religious affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three in four of those ages 50 to 64 claim membership in a religious 
organization such as a church or synagogue (74%), and membership rises to 80% 
of the people 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, 44% of people ages 50 to 64 attend worship services in a given 
week, and participation rises to more than half (52%) among those 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, among adults under age 30, just 59% report religious group 
membership and 32% say they attend worship services during a given week. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons we do not understand, there is a tendency for seniors to gravitate 
toward Protestant denominations, while the Roman Catholic faith progressively 
loses its older members. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years we have found that three in 10 young adults and a similar 
proportion of teen-agers say they are Roman Catholic by preference. But this 
figure erodes as they grow older. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, just 23% of those ages 50 to 64 and 20% of those 65 and older said 
they are Catholics, compared with 30% of those 30 and younger. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Protestant churches include 45% of all churchgoers under age 
30, more than half of adults 30 to 49, and two in three of those 50 and older.  
</P>
<P>
 Given the higher proportion of older adults who are Protestants, it is not 
surprising to find that people older than 50 describe themselves as "born 
again" or evangelical Christians increasingly as they age. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1988 survey conducted by Gallup for the Los Angeles Times, the belief 
that "we will all be called before God at the judgment day to answer for our 
sins" increased with age. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those under 30, only 45% expect to be called to judgment, but this 
increases to 50% among those 30 to 49, and to 60% by age 50. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1990 Gallup Poll found, however, that as people grow older there also is a 
tendency to believe less in heaven and hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the age of 16, most people (93%) believe in heaven, but by age 50 just 
74% do.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, 76% of younger teen-agers think there is a hell, but that belief is 
sustained by just 54% of those 50 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 Among senior citizens still believing in heaven, 76% rate their own chances of 
going there as excellent or good. Among believers in hell, only 5% fully expect 
to be there when judgment day arrives.

 What does it mean to live a spiritual life in modern times? Naoshwerwan Anzar, 
a writer, publisher and follower of Meher Baba, will ponder the question in a 
keynote address next Saturday at Occidental College's Herrick Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 His speech is part of a two-day celebration at Occidental of the 100th 
anniversary of the birth of the Indian spiritual master. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Avatar Meher Baba Center of Southern California and 
Occidental's HerrickChapel and Interfaith Center, the festivities -- to be held 
from noon to 10 p.m. Friday and from 1 to 10 p.m. next Saturday -- will include 
music, films and skits. Anzar will speak at 4 p.m. next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kerze, who teaches religion and science at Occidental and directs 
Herrick Chapel, said Baba devotees "are a part of the wonderful religious 
variety here in Southern California. I thought it would be good for our 
students to be exposed to one of the significant religious figures of our 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Merwan S. Irani on Feb. 25, 1894 in Poona, India, the Avatar, or Divine 
Incarnation, said his identity as God in human form was unveiled to him through 
a meeting with an old Muslim holy woman. The appellation Meher Baba, which 
means "compassionate father," was given him by his mandali , or "close ones," 
who were of many different castes and creeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Anzar, who has published Glow International, a magazine devoted to Baba, since 
1966, knew the leader when he lived in Anzar's hometown of Dehra Dun, India. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several of his close ones, including my father, were sent to bring lepers and 
other suffering people to him," Anzar said. "He would wash their feet, clothe 
them and send them on their way" transformed by the love they experienced in 
his presence, he recalled. Anzar said he has felt Baba's powerful presence on a 
number of occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Baba said that God takes human form every 700 to 1,400 years to spread the 
word of love, and that he had come to earth to awaken mankind to the universal 
spiritual messages given by such previous avatars as Buddha, Rama, Krishna, 
Mohammed and Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 The spiritualist, who "dropped his body," as his followers say, on Jan. 31, 
1969, wanted no religion created in his name but rather to emphasize the 
oneness of all religions. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Linda Zavala, chairwoman of the centennial event, "He came to 
awaken the love and divine intuition within each person through intimate 
contact, rather than teaching, as gurus do." 
</P>
<P>
 A celebratory dinner will be held at 5:30 p.m. next Saturday. Reservations are 
$10. All other events are free. For information, contact the Avatar Meher Baba

BRIDGE RETROFIT DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Swift Freeway Retrofits Urged" (Feb. 2) and "Public Safety Must Never Take a 
Back Seat" (editorial, Feb. 6) suggested that the court dispute between 
Caltrans and the union representing its engineers is to blame for the delay in 
retrofitting freeway structures. 
</P>
<P>
 We are saddened that top Caltrans officials would choose a time like this to 
try to blame their workers for delays in retrofitting freeway structures while 
Caltrans engineers are working feverishly in overseeing the clearing away of 
debris as well as preparing plans and contracts for repair of the damaged 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 What the public is not being told is that last year the legislative analyst, 
noting that the seismic retrofit program was more that one year behind the 
schedule established by the Legislature, was particularly critical of Gov. Pete 
Wilson for his proposed budget, which "siphons transportation funds" from the 
seismic safety retrofit account to the general fund in order to balance the 
state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The court battle between Caltrans and its engineers did nothing to "siphon" 
funds from the retrofit account or delay its implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 We do want to assure all local residents that the engineers in the Los Angeles 
Caltrans district office are working diligently and speedily to repair damages 
and complete the retrofit repairs. We are proud of Caltrans. We want the public 
to be proud of us too.

NATION OF ISLAM AND RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In light of the recent controversy surrounding Minister Louis Farrakhan, Ron 
Harris' column, "Ugly Words Don't Erase the Good Works of the Nation of Islam" 
(Feb. 11), was far from the mark in seeking to clarify or remove these 
tensions; rather it reinforces the very ideas of Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris begins with a false conclusion, namely that Farrakhan apologized.In 
reality, Farrakhan remains committed to the "truths" expressed by his demoted 
lieutenant, Khallid Abdul Muhammad. For some curious reason, Harris accepts the 
premise that black Americans see in the Nation of Islam "the best of 
themselves." Does he imply by this that the views of Farrakhan on Jews, women, 
gays, lesbians and Catholics, etc., represent the perceived and acceptable 
positions by much of black America? Or, does he believe that the Nation of 
Islam is truly the "conscience" within the African American society?  
</P>
<P>
 It is outrageous that, given the amount of black unemployment and needs, 
Harris would quote the very words of Muhammad that any individual who engages 
him or herself in a business enterprise inside the black community, but who 
comes into that community from outside, "is sucking economic life blood from 
that community." Harris goes beyond Farrakhan. This is neither a "truth" nor 
"undeniable," as it is unproductive at best and hateful at worst. Does he wish 
to allow for racial Balkanization, unemployment and distress to further depress 
America's inner cities? 
</P>
<P>
 If the words of Khallid Abdul Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan are troubling and 
problematic, then we are concerned and outraged when The Times repeats and 
apparently supports the ideas and words that are born of their prejudice and 
hate.

YELTSIN MAKES A MOVE: FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE?; WHATEVER, THE WEST MUST SEIZE THE 
OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sarajevo artillery crisis is becoming the Cuban missile crisis of the 
1990s. NATO has sworn that air strikes will follow if the Serb heavy artillery 
ringing the Bosnian capital is not removed by midnight Sunday and has backed up 
its words with the largest military preparations seen anywhere since the Gulf 
War. Meanwhile, Russia's special envoy to Sarajevo has sworn that such air 
strikes will lead to "all-out war," while back in Moscow President Boris N. 
Yeltsin's principal rival, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, has spoken of "World War III." 
</P>
<P>
 ENTER THE RUSSIANS: Uninvited, Russia has pledge 400 troops for Sarajevo. The 
United States has a leased naval base in Albania and 300 troops, not part of 
the NATO operation, in Macedonia. One Bosnian Serb military leader has sworn 
that if air strikes occur, all foreigners will be taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials have nervously welcomed the Russian move, which clearly caught 
them by surprise, and hopefully (or fearfully) reported Serb compliance with 
the ultimatum. But Secretary of State Warren Christopher sees only partial 
compliance, and Sarajevan Muslims fear a bluff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians may indeed be bluffing, but a more hopeful reading of the 
radically ambivalent Russian move is that Yeltsin, unable to bluff NATO, has 
decided -- with a suddenness that might be unbelievable in anyone except this 
most mercurial of leaders -- to join NATO in a South Slav police action. Like 
the Russians themselves, all of the combatants in the Balkans War are Slavs, 
but religion binds the Russians to the Eastern Orthodox Serbs and divides them 
from the Roman Catholic Croatians as well as from the religiously mixed but 
substantially Muslim Bosnians. In 19th and early 20th-Century Great Power 
struggles, Serbia sided with Russia, Croatia with Austro-Hungary, Bosnia with 
Turkey. Serbia remains a potent symbol for Yeltsin's hyper-nationalistic foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just possibly, Yeltsin has found a way to play the Serbian card his own way. 
If he can be seen at home to have rescued the Serbs from NATO, then even if he 
has also checked the Serbs' expansionistic adventure, he will have foiled 
Zhirinovsky. If he is willing to replicate the Sarajevo solution, placing a 
Russian cordon sanitaire around other besieged Bosnian towns, he will be hailed 
as a savior. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin may have realized how a Serbian victory could hurt him. The proposed 
partition of Bosnia would not just reward Serbian aggression, after all, but 
also inspire Russian neo-fascism. Zhirinovsky, Yeltsin's foe, is the Russian 
equivalent of Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's neo-fascist president. Zhirinovsky 
wants to defend the ethnic Russians in Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic states 
by uniting them in a Greater Russia just as Milosevic has sought to unite the 
ethnic Serbs in Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia. The trick, for Yeltsin, is to 
show that he can defend those ethnic Russians without being drawn into actions 
that would drag Russia down as surely as Milosevic's actions have dragged 
Serbia down. The defense of the Serbs may be just the needed demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 EXIT WITH PEACE?: But the implications are broader still. If NATO and Russia 
can stand together as a tacit alliance against ethnic aggression anywhere 
between the Atlantic and the Urals, no European ethnic group would benefit from 
this protection more than the scattered Russians themselves. The wars that may 
be averted elsewhere as East and West together impose peace in the Balkans are 
wars that Russians might otherwise have to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Muslims, understandably, are ready to see nothing more in the 
arrival of Russian ground troops than the reinforcement of the Serbs now that 
the Serbs are on the defensive. They may well be right, but this moment of 
rapidly growing peril is also one of unparalleled opportunity. Yeltsin and the 
NATO leaders, including President Clinton, must help one another to seize it.

THE STING OF SACRAMENTO; BRILLIANT FBI WORK SHOWS THE UNDERBELLY OF CORRUPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another one bites the political dust in Sacramento -- and the dust is still 
stirring. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), in a deal struck with federal prosecutors, 
pleaded guilty to political corruption and has resigned.It's the end to another 
chapter in a continuing, disgusting saga of government for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Republican Assembly leader agreed to enter a guilty plea to one 
racketeering count in exchange for a sentence of two years in prison and nine 
months in a halfway house. He thus avoided a trial on six criminal counts for 
which he could have expected a six-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week lobbyist Clayton R. Jackson was convicted of corruption and 
given a 6 1/2-year sentence. Jackson's co-defendant, disgraced former state 
Sen. Paul Carpenter, also was convicted but fled the country and is a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 All were swept up in the FBI's eight-year investigation of corruption in 
Sacramento, in which agents offered money in return for official action. The 
sting has led to the conviction or indictment of a dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI, to its credit, has relentlessly pursued the investigation, which has 
illuminated the dangerously cozy relationships between legislators and 
lobbyists in the state capital. Are lobbyists indeed the unelected arm of 
government in Sacramento? The investigation sadly demonstrates that too often 
legislating doesn't quite work the way it's described in the civics books.

TO THE MCA STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For months now, MCA Inc. has vigorously lobbied the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority in an attempt to relocate a proposed Red Line subway 
station, slated to open in the year 2000 on Lankershim Boulevard, a steep 
half-mile downhill from MCA's Universal Studios Hollywood theme park. MCA, 
rather late in the game, argued for a site more convenient to its studios and 
other popular venues, such as CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, according to transportation officials, was that MCA's request 
came so late that a change would cause significant additional costs (estimated 
at $41 million) in building the subway, and construction and design delays of 
up to two years. Transportation authority officials were adamant that MCA 
should defray much, if not all, of the new cost. MCA officials were equally 
adamant that they should not be forced to assume the full bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncomfortable truth here is that a Red Line station closer to MCA's 
property does makes more sense. It would be considerably less objectionable to 
MCA's residential neighbors. And it would ease transportation hassles for the 
several million, both tourists and local residents, who visit Universal City's 
attractions each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, a compromise has been proposed that might allay the transit 
agency's concerns over delays and costs and also meet MCA's wishes for a subway 
station that better accommodates visitors. At the request of Mayor Richard 
Riordan, James M. Okazaki, the chief of the city's transit programs, looked 
into the impasse and came up with what appears to be a win-win solution. He 
suggests using the original Lankershim site but adding an entrance to Universal 
Studios, shuttle service up the hill and roadway improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a workable plan, say county transportation officials. To MCA Development 
President Larry Spungin, it's "an 80-to-90% solution." Now, only a formal 
recommendation of the plan is needed. The transportation authority board should 
do just that -- and thank Riordan and Okazaki for their help.

AIDS WATCH; INDIFFERENCE FIGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the true profiles in courage are recorded for the century's last two 
decades, the life of Randy Shilts surely will be among them. The first openly 
gay reporter for a major American newspaper, he traced the rise of the cruel 
AIDS epidemic for the San Francisco Chronicle and in his 1987 book, "And the 
Band Played On." 
</P>
<P>
 His writing -- marked by dogged reporting, compelling narrative and attention 
to detail -- documented the shameful early indifference to the spreading viral 
plague by government, science and even the gay community itself. His work 
helped shut down gay bathhouses over the protests of San Francisco's 
politically potent but often narrow-minded gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last year, in another book, he shed powerful light on the national issue 
of homosexuals in the military. "Conduct Unbecoming: Gays in the U.S. Military 
From the Vietnam War Through the Gulf War" infuriatingly detailed how the 
military has wasted millions of dollars in ruthless witch hunts that purged the 
ranks of many loyal, capable service people who happened to be gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Shilts was no political advocate. He was above all a fair and principled 
professional journalist pledged to finding the truth, however painful. Often he 
was vilified by gay radicals for his reporting on the bathhouses and for his 
opposition to "outing" of prominent gay people. He told the unhappy story of 
AIDS and wrote there was "no excuse" for the spread of the disease. His death 
Thursday at 42 from the very disease he chronicled brings a tragic end to a 
hero's life.

PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to the President's budget call (Feb. 8) to pay for the health care 
reform package by raising the cigarette tax 99 cents per pack (I suspect a $1 
hike would seem too high): 
</P>
<P>
 I make the modest proposal that President Clinton not limit his sights to the 
smoking vice, but consider raising taxes on the real culprits on the well-being 
of our country. Specifically, a tax could be levied on the fat, cholesterol and 
sodium contained in the foods we eat. This fat tax (let us say .01 cent per 
gram of fat, cholesterol and sodium) would not only raise enough money to pay 
for health care many times over, but also these subsequent increased costs of 
fatty foods (one of the leading contributors to heart disease, hypertension and 
stroke) may lead the Clintons of our nation out of the neighborhood fast-food 
restaurants and into the salad bar, thereby improving the overall health of 
everyone.

 * Some of the comments about the Congressional Budget Office report on 
changing health expenditures and the health financing system are just plain 
foisting a "numbers game" on the public (Feb. 9). Clinton is the first to put 
on the table a plan that offers health care for all Americans by the year 2000 
and at the same time reduces total health care expenditures. The Congressional 
Budget Office report supports that fact. 
</P>
<P>
 It also agrees that the Health Security Act "holds the promise of reducing the 
deficit in the long term." 
</P>
<P>
 This act so far is the best on the table. Cancer patients and potential cancer 
patients are being devastated by illness. Let's not play "numbers games" on 
them when they can least afford game playing. Let's pass the act knowing it's 
not without controversy and get on with creating a system that "betters our 
best."

 * When I watch C-SPAN, I really get a kick out of the members of both houses 
of Congress who rail about "employer mandates" when they discuss health care. 
What hypocrisy! These same members, along with their dependents and employees, 
get full health care free at the expense of their employer, the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers/employers should pull the covers off Congress and demand that it 
adopt a single standard so both the taxpayer/employer and Congress pay the same 
for health care.

 * During Atty. Gen. Janet Reno's confirmation hearings, we all learned of her 
strong convictions in favor of crime prevention, in particular, diversion 
programs, during her emotional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, a review of programs eliminated in the new budget (Feb. 8) reveals that 
the largest program cut, and the only program cut totally in the Justice 
Department, is the Byrne Anti-Drug Abuse Formal Grant Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has apparently embraced intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for a war protester President and a "caring" attorney general, the lure 
of clandestine raids, automatic weapons and high-tech Defense Department 
surplus is too hard to resist. 
</P>
<P>
 Add drug abuse to the increasingly long list of America's social ills which 
are being institutionalized by government.

NATIONAL AGENDA

 A survey by the Times Mirror Center for The People and The Press reveals that 
"A plurality of 43% described the media as the most powerful force in setting 
the national agenda, whereas 22% cited political leaders in Washington" (Feb. 
3). How would such a system of government be characterized -- a media-ocracy?

REGULATING SEAFOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The seafood industry is in strong support of the new regulatory program 
recently announced by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner David 
Kessler and discussed in the paper's Feb. 1 editorial and in a Jan. 27 article. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several points about the new inspection program and the seafood 
industry that need to be clarified.This program represents a complete change in 
philosophy as to how the federal government will inspect food products in the 
future. The new program takes a proactive approach to food safety by preventing 
problems rather than correcting them after they have occurred. The approach 
that will be used by the seafood industry has been recommended by the 
prestigious National Academy of Sciences and is being considered for the meat 
and poultry industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety record of the seafood industry is a strong one, and under this new 
program, improvements will continue to be made. According to recent statistics 
from the FDA, less than 1% of food-borne illnesses are attributable to seafood, 
and this program aims at reducing this low number even further. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed regulations specifically call for processors to monitor for the 
presence of chemical contaminants in species where such problems are reasonably 
likely to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the new FDA program for fishery products is tough and legally 
enforceable with severe penalties for non-compliance. It is hardly an "honor 
system," even though, as with all laws in this country, full compliance depends 
largely on responsible citizenship. The fact that the seafood industry has 
consistently supported the new regulatory program should amply demonstrate this 
industry's sense of responsibility to its customers and the law.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; HOW NOT TO CONDUCT A TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1992 Santa Ana trial of orthopedic surgeon Thomas A. Gionis on charges of 
arranging an attack on his estranged wife, the daughter of actor John Wayne, 
displayed such a high profile that Court TV, a national cable channel, chose to 
cover it. It also has turned out to be an example of how the district 
attorney's office should not conduct a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal this week overturned Gionis' conviction on 
four felony charges stemming from the alleged attack on Aissa Wayne and her 
boyfriend in 1988, while she and Gionis were engaged in a bitter custody 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said the trial judge wrongly allowed testimony from a lawyer who had 
represented Gionis in a civil case. But even without that, the court said, then 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey A. Robinson engaged in a personal attack on Gionis' 
trial lawyer, Bruce Cutler, that was so over-the-top excessive as to warrant 
reversing the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The court rapped Robinson for his "vitriolic rebuttal and personal attacks" on 
Cutler, best known as the lawyer for New York mobster John Gotti. Robinson, now 
in private practice, rejected the criticism, saying Gionis got a fair trial. 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district attorney's office should make prosecutors aware of the 
court's reasoning. The same appeals court had warned Robinson about his conduct 
in another case, and this time it justifiably noted the unnecessary cost 
taxpayers would bear if the case is tried a third time. Gionis' first trial, 
with a different prosecutor and defense attorney, ended with a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
 More important than money is justice. It would be as bad to be forced to free 
a guilty man or woman because of prosecutorial misconduct as to convict an 
innocent person. This case should remind prosecutors of the need to follow the 
rules.

EVEN MCSORLEY ISN'T ENOUGH; HOCKEY: HE SCORES QUICKLY IN RETURN AS A KING, BUT 
COMMITS TWO MISCUES TO AID THE FLYERS' 4-3 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 It was Marty McSorley's night at the Forum on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 For 27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the crowd cheering in the pregame warm-ups before his first appearance 
as a King since the end of the Stanley Cup finals eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the adrenaline flowing in his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 He got a huge ovation when he was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 And he got the puck into the net on his first shift, taking a pass from Wayne 
Gretzky and putting it between the pads of Philadelphia Flyer goalie Dominic 
Roussel for his fourth goal of the season 27 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the triumphant return. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory went to the other side, two McSorley turnovers leading to Flyer 
goals that proved crucial as Philadelphia scored a 4-3 victory before a sellout 
crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley was disappointed after failing to get the one thing he most 
desperately wanted on Day 1 of his second tour as a King -- a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost," he said, "so there is nothing to relish or feel good about." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky did his best to temper the great expectations over the return of his 
long-time teammate in both Edmonton and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy can't be a savior," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Kings, Stanley Cup finalists a year ago, reeling dangerously close to 
missing the playoffs, the pressure was on to find someone such as McSorley, who 
had been traded in the off-season -- someone big and aggressive, both at the 
blue line and in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than settle for a reasonable facsimile, the Kings went out and got the 
genuine article, pulling off a trade with Pittsburgh last Tuesday to bring 
McSorley, one of the team's most popular players ever, back to the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pumped," McSorley said of his mood before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the goal, he said, "It was fun. I'll take a few more of those." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Melrose made the most of McSorley, using the defenseman for large 
chunks of time at both even strength and on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great player, a great person and a leader," Melrose said. "And you can 
never have enough of those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley's troubles began at the start of the second period when he lost the 
puck, Philadelphia taking advantage to tie the score on Mark Recchi's 31st 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flyers took the lead when Gretzky drew a rare trip to the penalty box, 
called for holding a stick. 
</P>
<P>
 With a man advantage, Philadelphia's Eric Lindros controlled a rebound that 
King goalie Robb Stauber couldn't hold and put the puck back between Stauber's 
pads for his 31st goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the period had ended, Robert Lang had again tied the score with his 
third goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the third period, McSorley fanned on a shot, Philadelphia taking 
control and moving quickly into the Kings' zone, where Mikael Renberg put the 
puck in the net, smashing it between Stauber and McSorley to give Philadelphia 
a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 When Melrose pulled Stauber with 1:40 to play, Lindros got the clincher, 
putting his team-leading 32nd goal into the empty net. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Rychel's ninth goal in the final minute was too little too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, the Kings' third in a row, drops them to 21-30-6 and leaves them 
five points behind the San Jose Sharks, owners of the final playoff spot in the 
Western Conference and the Kings' opponents tonight in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia is 27-29-4 after sweeping their two-game season series with the 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Can McSorley give the Kings the boost they need to make the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't lead without leading on the ice," McSorley said. "Nobody is going 
to listen to somebody who doesn't show it first." 
</P>

CLEMENTS A BIRDIE WATCHER; GOLF: HE SPIES 12 OF THEM IN HIS ROUND OF 61 TO TAKE 
THE BOB HOPE CLASSIC LEAD. CRENSHAW CARDS A 13 ON 18TH HOLE AT PGA WEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lennie Clements was on such a high at La Quinta Country Club on Friday, he 
didn't realize how low his score was. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Crenshaw was on such a low at the Palmer Course at PGA West, nobody was 
sure how high his score was at the 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements just kept firing everything at the pin and kept making birdie putts. 
When everything was totaled at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, he had a 
course-record 11-under-par 61, a 54-hole total of 19-under-par 197 and a 
one-stroke lead over Scott Hoch, the second-round leader who shot a 70, also at 
La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw kept pumping shots into the lake and finally ended his misery with a 
chip and two putts. When everything was totaled on No. 18, he had a record 13. 
It was only his ninth hole of the day because he had started his round at No. 
10. The 13 gave him a 45 for nine holes, then he played the front nine in 41 
and wound up with an 86, which left him at 229. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements was still in somewhat of a daze when asked if he could remember the 
last time he had led a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you mean on this tour?" Clements asked. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a legitimate question. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements has had some lean times during his 14-year career on the PGA Tour and 
hit his low in 1992 when he earned only $30,121. He supplemented his income by 
playing in 14 Nike Tour events. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw was still in somewhat of a daze when asked to explain how he took a 
13, declining to talk to the media. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 18 on the Palmer Course is a 532-yard hole that dog-legs to the left. A 
massive lake runs up the entire left side of the fairway. Crenshaw's drive 
found the fairway, but a four-wood, from 224 yards, landed in the water. Then, 
from 160 yards, he hit two seven-irons into the water. He went down to a 
six-iron and put that one into the water, too. He finally got his next shot, 
also a six-iron, over the lake and just past the green, chipped on and 
two-putted for his 13. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the tournament lowlight during a week in which scoring records have 
been threatened, tied or set every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come out here and just expect somebody to shoot a sub-65 round every 
day," said Jay Delsing, who had a 66 at Indian Wells that left him at 200, four 
strokes out of the lead and tied for third place with John Huston, who shot a 
66 on the Palmer Course. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Clearwater, with a 70, and Guy Boros, with a 67 -- both on the Palmer 
Course -- are tied for fifth at 201. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Sutton set the tone for the week with his opening-round 63 at Indian 
Wells; Hoch chipped in with his 62 on the Palmer Course Thursday and now that 
Clements has kept the streak going with his 61, nobody will be surprised with a 
60 today. 
</P>
<P>
 The record Clements broke was the 63 set by Rocco Mediate in 1991 and equaled 
by Blaine McCallister and Hoch the same year and by Mike Springer in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courses are so perfect, you just know there's going to be a lot of 
birdies," Clements said. "Once you get on a roll, you get confident and feel 
like you can make all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 In going over his round, Clements realized it could have been a day to shoot 
60 or better without needing much luck. 
</P>
<P>
 He birdied the first hole, making an 18-foot putt, but bogeyed the second 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a little bit of bad luck," he said. "I had to lay up on that hole 
because I drove it into a bunker. I thought I had hit it close enough to save 
par with a short putt, but the ball spun back about 40 feet." 
</P>
<P>
 That was his lone bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 He made birdie putts from six feet at the fourth hole, from five feet at the 
sixth, from 15 feet at the seventh and from 20 feet at the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was feeling pretty good about my round at the turn," he said. "It's nice to 
get it to four-under on the front nine with a bogey. Then you hope you can make 
another four-under on the back." 
</P>
<P>
 Clements almost birdied the 10th, but lipped out from 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 11th, a 526-yard hole, he hit his third shot from 90 yards to within 
two feet of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 He barely missed a 15-footer at the 12th. It was the last putt he would miss 
the rest of the round. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements laid up at the par-five 13th, then hit a wedge to 12 feet. Birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a six-iron to seven feet at the 14th. Birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a five-iron to 30 feet at the 15th. Birdie. "That was my best putt of 
the day," Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit an eight-iron to two feet at the 16th. Birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a five-iron to five feet at the 17th. Birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a five-iron to six feet at the 18th. Birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really exciting. People were cheering every time I hit an iron to the 
green. That meant it was close and I was going to have a chance at a birdie," 
Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are still two rounds to play, Clements isn't getting too excited 
about his chances -- yet.

TONYA GETS TO SKATE, AND A LOT OF READERS ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In rapid succession, the U.S. Figure Skating Assn., a Clackamas County judge 
and the U.S. Olympic Committee decided not to decide, and the hot potato has 
double-axeled her way onto the practice ice in Hamar, Norway. Astonishingly, 
having so publicly wilted in its faint-hearted defense of the phantom notion of 
an "Olympic ideal," the USOC has summoned the chutzpah to appeal to the 
International Skating Union and even (IOC President) Juan Antonio Samaranch to 
change Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding's practice schedules so they won't have 
to share the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale is clear: The USOC made a spineless decision, and now 
desperately wants someone to kiss and make it better. The USFSA and USOC have 
zambonied their own ice; now let them skate on it.

 Lynch-mob leader, oops, Sports Editor Bill Dwyre (Feb. 13) should be informed 
of the concept of due process. This difficult principle he so cavalierly wishes 
to sidestep is troublesome because, in his mind, Tonya Harding is guilty of 
something worse than having pitiful taste in men. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Dwyre calls the USOC spineless. I call them smart. The USOC, in not 
heeding ill-founded opinions from assassin/journalists such as Mr. Dwyre, who 
are more than willing to shoot first and ask later, showed excellent judgment, 
for they knew they had no legal leg to stand on, good knees or no.

 I give Bill Dwyre a gold for his commentary. Like the Wizard of Oz, the USOC 
is but a shell of the ideals they profess to exemplify. 
</P>
<P>
 If the USOC really wanted to reduce the controversy in Lillehammer, then they 
should have excluded the cause, one admitted liar, from the American team. 
Maybe the USOC should go to Oz and ask the Wizard for some heart, brains and 
courage.

 Bill Dwyre is certainly entitled to his opinion regarding the USOC's decision 
on Tonya Harding. However, Mr. Dwyre does not know what he is talking about 
when he places the blame on Harding's lawyers and the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwyre says: "Tonya Harding might be the greatest bonanza to billable hours in 
the history of the State of Oregon." Tonya's lawyers accomplished for their 
client the ultimate 100% victory with a bare minimum of billable hours. In 
reaching this victory in a very short time, the lawyers very likely cut 
themselves out of a fee of $10 million or so, to which they would have been 
entitled on a recovery of a $25-million judgment.

 I am the ultimate Olympics fan, but I don't think I'll be watching much more 
this year. I watched all day Sunday expecting to see some events.All I saw was 
advertisements for the prime-time show (on which I saw approximately nine 
minutes of competition in the first hour) and heard the anchors tell who won 
all the events. Who wants to watch the downhill when you already know Tommy Moe 
won? 
</P>

 Everyone made fun of NBC's triplecast, but at least you got to see the

BLAME THE SCHEDULE FOR USC'S TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Raveling is absolutely correct, he has the same group of people that 
had a 7-2 record prior to Pac-10 play (Feb. 10).This is certainly not any 
accomplishment he should advertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he can review the schedule that made him 7-2. If he could reschedule 
the same teams for the balance of the season, he would end up 14-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it, the Trojans should forget about this season. They got beat by 
30 by Washington State and 29 by UCLA. Something I'm sure Mr. Raveling is proud 
of.

JORDAN RULES MIGHT NOT APPLY TO BASEBALL

 Apparently, Michael Jordan believes his .269 batting average during Babe Ruth 
baseball qualifies him to play in the major leagues. I batted 30 points better 
than that during my Babe Ruth career, and the highest level of success I ever 
achieved was municipal slow-pitch softball.As player-coach of a team in Santa 
Monica, I would certainly consider giving him a tryout. He can call me at 
1-800-GET REAL.

full powers rather than one.

 I agree with Jim Murray's analysis (Feb. 13) of the major league curveball, so 
Mr. Jordan is at small risk to get exiled a second time.

TRADE FOR MCSORLEY TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE?

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a longtime King fan who had finally seen the team turn the corner to 
respectability, it upsets me to watch General Manager Nick Beverley tear this 
team apart. During his two-year tenure, he has traded the likes of All-Stars 
Paul Coffey, Bob Kudelski, Jimmy Carson and Tomas Sandstrom for players such as 
Gary Shuchuk, Doug Houda, the venerable Jim Thomson and now Jim Paek. 
</P>
<P>
 As Beverley will soon find out, the Kings have many more problems than even 
Marty McSorley's broad shoulders can carry.

MANNING IS NOT AT A LOSS, CLIPPERS ARE; PRO BASKETBALL: FORWARD ALMOST HAS 
TRIPLE-DOUBLE IN 97-91 DEFEAT BY HAWKS, BUT SPEAKS OUT ABOUT HARPER'S ABSENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Danny Manning showed where he stood on his left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 With his best friend, Ron Harper, suspended for Friday night's game against 
the Atlanta Hawks for making derogatory comments about the Clippers, Manning 
wore a sweatband with No. 4, Harper's uniform number, on his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a sweatband for No. 4," Manning said. "It's also Spud Webb's number, 
what are you trying to say? You make of it what you like. It was a sweatband 
with No. 4." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning replaced Harper at shooting guard, and came within one assist of 
getting his second triple-double of the season in a 97-91 loss to the Hawks 
before 12,500 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning -- who had 27 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists -- one shy of his 
career high, was visibly upset after not getting the triple-double. 
</P>
<P>
 "One assist!," he said as he studied a stat sheet after the game. "Y'all 
supposed to find me a . . . . assist." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Manning think the suspension of Harper, which cost the guard $48,780.49, 
was fair? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like it holds any water," Manning said. "It doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Manning told a wire service reporter: It's the first time I've heard 
of someone being suspended for speaking the truth. Never assume, he could be 
talking about the city." 
</P>
<P>
 What did the Clippers miss by not having Harper, their second leading scorer? 
</P>
<P>
 "We missed 18 or 19 points a game, that's what we missed," Manning said. "It 
kind of throws off your rotation when you don't have one of your starters that 
you've been depending on all year. Ron's a slasher. This is the type of game he 
excels at." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning didn't have much trouble switching to guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it is just your mind set," Manning said. "You can't crash the 
boards, and you have to make sure we have some type of floor balance when we 
have the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who wasn't allowed to sit on the bench or be in uniform, declined 
comment Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Charles Outlaw, signed to a 10-day contract on Monday, replaced Manning 
at small forward and did a good job against Hawk forward Dominique Wilkins, who 
missed 13 of 20 shots and scored 19 points. Outlaw had 10 points and nine 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clippers couldn't contain reserve guard Craig Ehlo, who sank five 
three-point shots and scored 20 points, including 15 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed, 86-77, outscored Atlanta, 10-3, to cut it to 89-87. 
Manning had the final four points in the run, hitting a pair of free throws and 
a jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hawks outscored the Clippers, 10-4, in the final 4:23 to hand the 
Clippers (17-31) their second loss in a row. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Grantham, executive director of the National Basketball Players Assn., 
said he plans to meet with Ron Harper and his agent, Mark Termini, this weekend 
before deciding whether to file a grievance over Harper's one-game suspension.

NBA ROUNDUP; PAYBACK IS SWEET FOR MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You would think Orlando hadn't been around long enough to spawn any enmity in 
the NBA, but the Magic apparently works fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it just takes things a bit personally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic players avenged what they considered a personal slight of their meal 
ticket, Shaquille O'Neal, feeding him enough for him to score 38 points Friday 
night in a 124-93 rout of the Seattle SuperSonics at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 He fed himself a bit, too, grabbing 20 rebounds against the team with the 
NBA's best record and three all-stars, including Coach George Karl. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently that was the rub. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando lost to Seattle by 24 points on Dec. 14 in a game in which O'Neal was 
ejected for committing a flagrant foul against Shawn Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
 In the All-Star game Sunday, O'Neal was double- and triple-teamed, being held 
to eight points, and his Orlando teammates believed Seattle's all-stars, Kemp, 
Gary Payton and Karl, wanted to make him look bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was motivated, but Penny (Anfernee Hardaway) was real motivated," O'Neal 
said. "He was mad. There were tears in his eyes. He said, 'Those guys tried to 
embarrass you. When we play them, I'll get you the ball 50 times. You'll get 50 
dunks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal made 16 of 19 shots, most of them dunks. He has averaged 37 points and 
22 rebounds in two games since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 113, Washington 110 -- Kenny Anderson missed his first six shots, 
then scored a career-high 42 points, including the game-winning layup over 
7-foot-7 rookie Georghe Muresan with 7.5 seconds to play at Baltimore, as the 
Nets won their fourth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 109, Chicago 84 -- Bryant Stith scored eight of his 28 points as the 
Nuggets started the second half with a 21-9 run that lifted them at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 106, Charlotte 99 -- Ken Norman scored 25 points to lead six players 
in double figures at Charlotte, N.C., as the Bucks ended a three-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 85, Minnesota 78 -- Mark Price and Brad Daugherty combined for 
11-for-31 shooting at Minneapolis, but the Cavaliers' substitutes outscored the 
Timberwolves' reserves, 34-4, in their ninth loss in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 109, Philadelphia 93 -- Clifford Robinson scored 30 points as the 
Trail Blazers won at Portland after 76er rookie center Shawn Bradley strained 
ligaments when he twisted his left knee after a collision with Harvey Grant 37 
seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 90, Utah 81 -- Mitch Richmond of the Kings missed 14 of 17 shots 
through three quarters, then recovered to score 18 of his 27 points in the 
fourth quarter at Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
 Richmond scored five points in a 7-0 run that gave the Kings an 83-75 lead 
with 1:15 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel Simmons scored 18 points for Sacramento, which has won four of its last 
five games.

DUCKS SUFFER A POWER OUTAGE AS QUEBEC HAS ENOUGH TO WIN; HOCKEY: UNABLE TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF POWER PLAYS, ANAHEIM IS PUT ON THE DEFENSIVE AND LOSES, 1-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a game of two pitiful performances by teams that can't afford to play 
poorly. But somebody was bound to win it, and the Quebec Nordiques did Friday, 
defeating the Mighty Ducks 1-0, before 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no screams for refunds, but maybe there should have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every game is important, every point is important, especially with L.A. 
losing," Coach Ron Wilson said. "It's inexcusable not to be ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had three or four defensemen who were awful. We had a number of forwards 
who didn't play. We had guys in neutral." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was scoreless for a second short of 40 minutes before Scott Young 
scored on a deflection of Alexei Gusarov's point shot at 19:59 of the second 
period with Quebec enjoying a two-man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephane Fiset made 28 saves for his second career shutout and Quebec's first 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a struggle of two weak power plays -- powerless power plays, really. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks entered the game ranked 23rd in the NHL, scoring on only 16% of its 
opportunities. And it is a bad power play on a bad streak -- the Ducks had 
scored in only five of their last 49 opportunities before the game, and went 0 
for seven against Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly, the Nordique power play is even worse, entering the game ranked 
25th at 14.8%, only marginally better than Tampa Bay.  
</P>
<P>
 The Nordiques failed on their first five power plays, but finally, with a 
two-man advantage for 1:17 at the end on the second period, even they could 
fail no more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nordiques, skating 5-on-3 after Sean Hill was sent off for slashing and 
Bobby Dollas joined him in the penalty box for high-sticking. And they 
effectively had a 5-on-2 advantage for a few seconds when Bob Corkum chased a 
puck and got caught behind the play. But Quebec still couldn't score, missing 
high or wide or being stopped even after skating to within 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoreless game finally ended when Young deflected Gusarov's slap shot from 
the left point after the Nordiques won a faceoff with just seconds left in the 
second period. The puck trickled in to the right of goalie Ron Tugnutt and 
crossed the goal line with a second left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 In a final effort to tie the score, Wilson pulled Tugnutt for an extra 
attacker with 1:35 left, but the last-gasp effort was botched by a lost 
faceoff, meaning Tugnutt had to come back out. Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving for the Winter Olympics, General Manager Jack Ferreira said he 
was not optimistic that No. 4 overall draft pick Paul Kariya will join the 
Ducks this season, as had been hoped. "Right now, I think (the chances are) 
slim," he said, adding he believes the sides are far apart financially. Kariya, 
who is playing for Canada in the Lillehammer Games, maintains he has not 
decided whether to return to the University of Maine for one more semester or 
turn professional. "I get every indication if we put the right deal on the 
table, he'll be here right after the Olympics," Ferreira said. . . . Though he 
is the only GM who has not made a trade since the season began, Ferreira said 
he is looking for a scorer. "I'm trying," he said. "A lot of people don't know 
who the hell our players are. I'm serious." . . . Left wing Garry Valk was 
assessed a high-sticking major and game misconduct in the first period, and 
Coach Ron Wilson expected it to be rescinded after a review, though he said 
that couldn't make up for losing Valk for most of the game.

NHL ROUNDUP; CAPITALS SWITCH ON THE POWER PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Washington Capitals had been playing as though points were awarded for 
style. Their power play was lovely to watch, but basically powerless, as 
witness a one-for-26 performance going into Friday's game against the New York 
Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 It became one for 29 before Randy Burridge and Dimitri Khristich scored 
power-play goals in the second period and Al Iafrate added one in the third in 
a 3-1 victory over the Islanders at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easy enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to shoot to score," center Mike Ridley said. "We've been a little 
guilty of trying to work the pretty play, rolling in and out all over the 
place. The best solution is to keep firing at the goalie." 
</P>
<P>
 The Capitals did in stretching their record to 5-0-1 over the last six games 
and 8-2-1 under new Coach Jim Schoenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 5, Edmonton 1 -- Ray Sheppard scored the 200th goal of his career and 
Paul Coffey had three assists for the Red Wings at home as Edmonton's winless 
streak stretched to six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard's goal, on a power play, was also his 44th of the season, tying 
Toronto's Dave Andreychuk for the NHL lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit won its fourth in five games; Edmonton dropped to 0-5-1 in its last 
six. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 3, Ottawa 0 -- Adam Graves scored two goals and assisted on 
another at New York in a game between the teams with the NHL's best and worst 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senators failed to win for the 11th consecutive game (0-8-3). Their 
NHL-worst record is 9-43-8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers lead the overall NHL standings with a 37-15-4 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 4, Florida 1 -- Donald Audette scored two power-play goals and Dominik 
Hasek stopped 27 shots to lead the Sabres at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Dawe and Brad May also scored as the Sabres beat Florida for the first 
time in three meetings this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 4, Calgary 2 -- Russ Courtnall and Mike Modano each had a goal and an 
assist as the Stars won at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas is 8-2-0 in its last 10 games. Calgary had won six of its previous 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 3, Boston 1 -- Brendan Shanahan and Brett Hull scored power-play 
goals seven seconds apart in the third period, and Curtis Joseph blocked 40 
shots for the Blues at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, Winnipeg 2 -- Michel Goulet moved into a tie with Maurice Richard 
for 11th on the NHL's all-time scoring list with his 544th goal and the 
Blackhawks won at Winnipeg to extend the Jets' winless streak to 14 games.

 Summers in California, winters playing hockey in Rouen, France. . . . As 
French Olympic left wing Eric Lemarque says cheerfully, "Life's a beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Lemarque, the son of a French father and an American mother, grew up in 
Southern California and began playing hockey in the now-defunct Topanga Hockey 
Assn. and in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemarque later went to Detroit for two seasons, finished high school a year 
early and attended Northern Michigan University on a full scholarship. He was 
drafted by the Boston Bruins after his first year -- he earned a degree in 
marketing and a place among the school's top 10 goal scorers -- but wasn't 
offered a contract and so went to France. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my French passport now because European citizens can play in other 
leagues in other countries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemarque, 24, returns to Manhattan Beach each summer, except for the six weeks 
he teaches at hockey schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my third season in the French European League and first on the 
national team," he said. "This has just worked out great."

U.S. GETS ITS LICKS, BUT MISSES BY TICK; LUGE: AMERICAN TEAMS FINISH FOURTH AND 
FIFTH IN TWO-MAN EVENT FOR BEST OLYMPIC SHOWING.

 It's the top man's feet, the bottom man's shoulders. Body language is vital in 
luge doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not communicating it ain't going to work," Mark Grimmette said. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked for U.S. sledders Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not well enough yet to win a medal in this back-to-the-wall sport, but for the 
U.S. Luge Federation, progress is the most important product. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth-place finish by Grimmette and Jonathon Edwards in Winter Olympics 
doubles Friday was the best U.S. luge finish in any Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer were a tick behind in fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Wendel Suckow's fifth place last Monday had been a U.S. best in 
men's singles and that Duncan Kennedy apparently had been on a medal pace when 
he crashed, Ron Rossi, executive director of U.S. Luge, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be tough to improve on what we did here and not win a medal in '98. 
I'm not happy that it didn't happen here, but we're making progress. We're even 
with the Austrians and just behind the Germans and Italians." 
</P>
<P>
 Luge became a permanent Olympic sport in '64. Germans, Italians, Austrians and 
Soviets have won all 81 medals. 
</P>
<P>
 It was viva Italia! Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Brugger and Wilfried Huber, seventh in the Calgary Olympics and fifth at 
Albertville, won the gold by 0.049 seconds over countrymen Hans Raffl and 
Norbert Huber, Wilfried's brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending Olympic champions Stefan Krausse and Jan Behrendt of Germany were 
third, 0.344 of a second ahead of Grimmette and Edwards, who were 0.008 ahead 
of Sheer and Thorpe. 
</P>
<P>
 Luge doubles is a two-heat, one-day event, compared to the four heats and two 
days of singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest ranger Brugger, 24, and police officer Huber, 23, caught first-heat 
leaders Raffl, 35, and Norbert Huber, 29, with a 48.372 second heat compared to 
48.495. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheer and Thorpe, fourth overall in World Cup this season and fourth after the 
first heat, needed to eclipse the Raffl-Huber course record of 48.274 to finish 
third. They did 48.725 and were edged out of fourth by the 48.672 of 
Grimmette-Edwards, who were fifth after the first heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've focused on being best in the world, not just the U.S.," Grimmette said. 
"We're happy to finish fourth, but we're not where we want to be yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes quite a few years to learn luge skills. Hans Raffl has been sliding 
almost as long as I've been alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimmette, 23, and Edwards, 21, fourth in World Cup a year ago but an injured 
and inconsistent 12th this season, have been together since 1988, as have 
Sheer, 22, and Thorpe, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 All four, Thorpe said Friday, felt they were on the bubble in singles but have 
thrived on the teamwork of doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 How close are they to consistently catching the Italians and Germans? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be there next year," Thorpe said, adding that his and Sheer's next goal 
is to win the overall World Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
 The '98 Olympics? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to go, but it's up to Gordy," Thorpe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might move on, and I'd have to start over with a new partner." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheer is a part-time student at Ohio State. Edwards is considering Stanford, 
Yale and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams are taking it year to year. Partnerships are as difficult to 
develop as friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to know each other inside out," Sheer said the other day. "Chris and 
I have literally butted heads a few times, but basically there's total trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pretty much spend every day of our lives together. I mean, we sometimes 
get upset like brothers, but if you hold a grudge on the ice, you're going to 
end up killing each other." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a strange business, two grown men literally lying on top of each other on 
a small sled, traveling up to 75 m.p.h., each with only peripheral vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration and tension are easily transmitted. Any unplanned or unexpected 
movement can upset the aerodynamics -- and relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very much like family, and no one has a better feel for it than the 
Hubers -- Wilfried, Norbert and Arnold, who did not qualify here. Along with 
bobsledding brother Gunther, who begins competition today, Italy's royal family 
of sledding has won 42 medals in Olympics, World Cup and European 
championships. While the U.S. attempts to build teams, the Hubers have their 
own.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Canadian Myriam Bedard made history Friday in the women's 15-kilometer 
biathlon, becoming the first Olympic champion from North America. Biathlon 
combines cross-country skiing and target shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard, who finished third in the 1992 Olympics, missed only two targets on 
the shooting range and skied the tough course in 52 minutes 6.6 seconds. Anne 
Briand of France was second. She skied 46.7 seconds slower than Bedard and had 
three misses. Uschi Disl of Germany also missed three times and finished 1:08.7 
behind Bedard, taking the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Smith of Honeoye Falls, N.Y., placed 14th, the best finish ever by a U.S. 
woman, and her teammate, Joan Guetschow of Minnetonka, Minn., was 17th, marking 
the first time that two U.S. athletes finished in the top 20.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Todd Lodwick of Steamboat Springs, Colo., soared to a surprising fifth place 
in the ski jump half of the Nordic combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Lodwick, 17, went 301 feet 10 inches on his first jump off the normal hill, 
then slipped to 285-5 on his second. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished just ahead of world champion Kenmji Ogiwara of Japan with 232 
points and will start 1:40 behind Norwegian Fred Borre Lundberg today in the 
15k cross-country portion of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundberg went 303-5 and 301-10 on his jumps, for 247 points, and will have a 
23-second advantage in the race over Ago Markvardt of Finland. Markvardt sailed 
303-5 and 289-6 for 243.5 points in finishing second. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Norwegian, Bjarte Engen Vik, had 240.5 points on jumps of 300-2 and 
301-10 and will start 43 seconds behind Lundberg.

 Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean of England, Olympic champions 10 years ago,

 Maia Usova and Alexander Zhulin, 1993 world champions, were tied for the lead 
with fellow Russians Oksana Gritschuk and Evgeny Platov after the compulsory 
round.

 The compulsories count for 20% of the total score. Original dance competition 
is scheduled for Sunday and free dance for Monday.

 Americans Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow, skating under difficult

 According to a Lillehammer press agency, Rodney Woolford of the Trinidad 
bobsled team "has had enough of Lillehammer." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Rodney's luggage containing all his warm clothing and training 
gear failed to arrive with Rodney from the islands. Then, when it did turn up, 
half his gear was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 A cardboard box full of team gear also has disappeared, then Woolford got sick 
and will be unable to compete.

 According to the Lillehammer press report, " 'I am longing to get back home,' 
says the distraught Trinidadian."

 Possibly more good news for U.S. skiers? 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo Street of Sun Valley, Ida., won the final training run for the women's 
downhill, to be raced today. 
</P>
<P>
 Street's time of 1 minute 36.50 seconds was .19 faster than German's Katja 
Seizinger, the race favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the downhill here," Street said. "There's a lot going on all the way 
down. And the snow is really hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Hilary Lindh, the defending Olympic silver medalist, was 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Parisien, meanwhile, is looking like a medal threat in the women's 
combined, a two-day event that combines the times for a separate downhill and 
slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien, not noted as much of a speed skier, has taken a liking to the 
Kvitfjell downhill course and has been among the training leaders for skiers 
who will also ski combined. 
</P>
<P>
 If Parisien can finish high in the downhill, she figures to make up 
considerable time on the others in the slalom, her specialty.

 After much soul searching, Canada's Kerrin Lee-Gartner has decided to race in 
today's downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee-Gartner has been deeply affected by the recent death of her good friend, 
Austrian Ulrike Maier, killed Jan. 29 in a downhill crash at 
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee-Gartner, the defending Olympic champion, has not competed in a downhill 
race since Maier's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a lot of mistakes today," she said after placing 31st in downhill 
training. "But it was fun to race again." CHRIS DUFRESNE

 Beating the Tulsa Oilers was never like this. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludek Bukac, who played for Oklahoma City of the old Central Hockey League in 
1964, achieved a first in German Olympic hockey history Friday when he coached 
his team to a 4-2 victory over Russia.Germany was 0-8 in the Olympics against 
Russia and its predecessors, having scored only nine goals and given up 61. 
Germany was 1-79-2 against Russia in all matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winning of games is pushing us forward, making progress for hockey in 
Germany," said Bukac, who also coached the Czech national team for six years 
and had never defeated the Soviets. "If you play successfully, the coach lives 
for another day." 
</P>
<P>
 Bukac seems to have little to fear after leading Germany to a fifth-place 
finish in the 1993 World Championships and a 3-1 record here. Friday's triumph, 
in which three-time Olympian Bernd Truntschka scored his first two Olympic 
goals, gave Germany a berth in the medal round. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia is 2-2 after starting the Games with a 60-6-2 record since its hockey 
debut in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense is the weakest part of our game," assistant Russian coach Igor 
Dmitriev said. "We have to improve in that area. . . . This team is losing its 
self-assurance, and it is not the team it was before." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bukac: "In our day, the Russians were always a strong team, but this 
competition is tougher now because the Russians are not a dominating team. The 
bottom teams are competing better, so it's not easy to play them."

TUGNUTT CAN'T QUITE SAVE THE DAY FOR MIGHTY DUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Goaltender Ron Tugnutt saw the windup clearly. But then the tangle of bodies 
moved in front of the net and he had to rely on guess work. 
</P>
<P>
 In a flash, the puck was past Tugnutt and into the back of the Mighty Duck 
net. Goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec's Mike Ricci won a faceoff, sending the puck along the boards to Martin 
Rucinsky, who passed it back to Alexei Gusarov, who was standing just inside 
the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
 Gusarov faded left, toward the center of the rink, and fired a slap shot 
toward Tugnutt.  
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt had a clear view of all that, but saw nothing after the puck left 
Gusarov's stick. Later, someone told Tugnutt that Scott Young had deflected the 
puck, sending it trickling into the net with 0.5 seconds left in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than anything it's anticipation," Tugnutt said of trying to stop a shot 
he can't see. "You hope it hits you or goes wide." 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt handled every other shot easily, but so did Quebec goalie Stephane 
Fiset and the Nordiques won hockey's version of a pitchers' duel, 1-0, Friday 
at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is only supposed to happen for us not against us," Tugnutt said after 
stopping 24 of the 25 shots he faced against his former team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we played well. Their goalie made some key saves. Give Stephane 
credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's game was ugly from start to finish. Even the simplest passes seemed 
to always be mishandled. Scoring chances came and went . . . awry. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for sharp goaltending from Tugnutt and Fiset, it would have been a 
truly forgettable night. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt hadn't donned a Quebec uniform since 1991-92, but he said the 
competitive juices were flowing right from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 He had already beaten the Edmonton Oilers, who did not protect him in the 
expansion draft, three times, including a 6-3 victory Sunday. And there was no 
question that Coach Ron Wilson would start Tugnutt against Quebec, where he 
played for all or part of five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (he and Hebert) have won five out of seven against our former teams," 
Tugnutt said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tugnutt couldn't stop a shot he never saw and a deflection he only heard 
about later and the Ducks lost, 1-0. It was as simply as that.

ESTANCIA UP TO SPEED, BUT PACIFICA STILL WINS; DIVISION III-A: EAGLES COME OUT 
RUNNING, BUT THE MARINERS STREAK OFF WITH A 94-72 VICTORY TO ADVANCE.

 Pacifica, that whirlwind of a basketball team, found someone who would come 
out and play Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia wasn't going to hold the ball or play it cagey. The Eagles were going 
to throw caution to the wind and run with the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 When the running was done, the Mariners had a 94-72 victory at Pacifica to 
advance to the second round of the Southern Section III-A boys' basketball 
playoffs. They will play Pasadena Blair on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came to run," said Mariner center Jonathan Surface, who had 15 points and 
10 rebounds. "They did to. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
 It was, that is, from the Pacifica side. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles played at their normal tempo; Pacifica was just better at it. As 
any Garden Grove League coach will attest, you don't run-and-gun with the 
Mariners (24-1). You don't even jog with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica rolled to the league title with a press-and-stress style. Opposing 
teams made a point not to play tag with the Mariners, but Estancia (15-11) 
would have none of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were a running team," guard Chris Vlasic said. "We were anxious 
for this game to begin." 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic certainly was ready. He scored six points in 30 seconds in the first 
quarter. Vlasic made 10 of 16 shots and finished with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
 He had plenty of help. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Alliman scored 17 and Ryan Teague 15. The Mariners came at the Eagles in 
waves. They used 11 players in the first quarter and wore the Eagles down. 
Pacifica forced 29 turnovers, many of which were converted into points off the 
fast break. 
</P>
<P>
 "When love to play at the pace," Surface said. "We have lots of players and we 
keep coming at people." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica didn't waste much time in its set offense, either. The Mariners made 
11 three-pointers. Even Surface, their 6-foot-8 center, stepped outside -- but 
not out of character -- and sank three three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia never had a chance. Whatever the Eagles did, the Mariners did better. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' Mike Drake did a sharp stop-and-pop move, slicing between two 
defenders in the third quarter. Vlasic came right back and, sandwiched between 
two defenders, scooped a shot in under their arms and was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners pulled away with a series of runs. They outscored Estancia, 11-2, 
to take a 25-16 lead at the end of the first quarter. Pacifica went on a 14-0 
tear in the second quarter and led, 57-37 at halftime. A 14-2 run made it 76-47 
with 1 minute 16 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're relentless," Pacifica Coach Bob Becker said. "We don't back off." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did the Eagles. They were just run off.

SANTA MARGARITA TWINS TEAM TO BEAT LA QUINTA; DIVISION III-AA: BRIAN FINNERAN 
RETURNS, MAKING KEY PLAYS WITH BROTHER BRAD TO HELP THE EAGLES ADVANCE, 73-58. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Identical twins Brad and Brian Finneran have been a standout tandem for the 
Santa Margarita High boys' basketball team. And unfortunately for La Quinta, 
the senior twin towers (each 6 feet 5) played like a championship tag team 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Reunited in a game for the first time since Brian suffered a broken right foot 
more than three weeks ago, the Finnerans made the key plays in leading Santa 
Margarita to a 73-58 victory over La Quinta in the first round of the Southern 
Section Division III-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad, at center, scored a team-high 19 points with eight rebounds, five blocks 
and four steals, and Brian, at power forward, scored eight of his 10 points 
during the decisive moments of the fourth quarter as the Sea View League 
co-champions improved to 21-6. The Eagles will play Pomona (18-10) in the 
quarterfinals Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita Coach Jerry DeBusk was understandably pleased to have his 
powerful duo at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "As always, it was the combination of Finneran to Finneran," DeBusk said. 
"They made the plays when we needed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad passed to Brian for a layup with 2 minutes 8 seconds to play that gave 
the Eagles a 63-58 lead and sent the Aztecs into desperation mode. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta (15-11), which finished third in the Garden Grove League, forced 
several shots and failed to score in its final five possessions. After having 
only a one-point lead (31-30) at halftime, Santa Margarita outscored La Quinta 
in the second half, 42-28. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we really picked it up defensively in the second half," Brad said. 
"We all were a lot more active and we went after the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta Coach Jim Perry was perplexed by his team's poor showing with the 
game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened . . . no one has been able to guard us all year," 
Perry said. "We just couldn't get the ball to go down after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were getting the same (shots) as in the first half but we couldn't do 
anything with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles gladly took some of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried a lot of different defenses to throw off (La Quinta's outside 
shooters)," DeBusk said, "and some of them started to work in the second half."

DIVISION III-AA ROUNDUP; HENDERSON'S 22 POINTS KEY MAGNOLIA VICTORY

 Senior point guard Frank Henderson scored 22 points and had nine rebounds to 
lead Magnolia to a 52-47 victory over Newport Harbor at Magnolia in a Division 
III-AA boys' basketball playoff game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia will meet Servite in Tuesday's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels (19-7) trailed, 12-10, after one quarter, but outscored the 
Sailors, 15-6, in the second quarter to take a 25-18 halftime lead. Magnolia, 
which recorded its 17th consecutive home victory, extended the lead to 11 
points, 29-18, early in the third quarter. But Newport Harbor (13-14) fought 
back, cutting the lead to four on Will Rankin's basket early in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were in control with that lead, but we didn't play good defense 
and they stayed with us," Magnolia Coach Al Wallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor played without starting center Ramy Shoukry, who underwent an 
emergency appendectomy Monday. His replacement, John Giordani, was brought up 
from the junior varsity. He responded by scoring 11 points, all in the second 
half, to keep the Sailors close. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia's LaShawn Neal sealed the victory, scoring two key baskets in the 
last 1:30 and blocking two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting this first game out of the way is always tough. I was pleased with 
our performance tonight," Wallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Tayyar led Newport Harbor with 12 points. SCOTT JONES

DIVISION I-A ROUNDUP; KROEGER'S BIG PLAY HELPS EDISON WIN IN OVERTIME, 58-57 
</P>

 Edison needed something extra, and Micah Kroeger delivered it -- a four-point 
play -- to help send the game into overtime before Edison edged Century, 58-57, 
in a Southern Section Division I-A second-round boys' basketball playoff game 
Friday at Edison High. 
</P>
<P>
 With Edison trailing, 54-50, Kroeger, who had 24 points and 10 rebounds, made 
a three-pointer while Ronnie Arristondo fouled him with 12 seconds remaining, 
then made the free throw to send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had our fannies beat," Edison Coach Larry Hirst said. "That was probably 
a game we shouldn't have won, but we'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Century missed the front end of eight one-and-ones in the fourth quarter and 
overtime to help Edison (18-8) advance to the quarterfinals to play Orange, a 
69-61 winner over Corona. Century (23-5) ended its most successful season. 
</P>
<P>
 In overtime, Edison made four of six free throws; Century made three of six. 
Although Thomas Harmon, who had a game-high 26 points for Century, got two good 
shots in the overtime, neither fell and Edison managed to play keep-away and 
run out the final 14 seconds before Century could foul anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Century is the most physical, quick, defensive team we've played," Hirst 
said. "We weren't playing well offensively, but that's a credit to their 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison committed 24 turnovers and shot 34% (11 of 32) from the field in the 
second half, yet rallied from a nine-point deficit in the final 3 minutes 12 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 After Century missed two front ends of one-and-ones, Ali Tofighi, who had 
seven points and 14 rebounds, scored after an offensive rebound to cut the lead 
to 50-46 with 1:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 After two more missed front ends of one-and-ones, a short hook shot by Ben 
Beard drew the Chargers within 50-48 with 1:06 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Visal Yam made four free throws for Century and Kroeger answered with a 
layup, but Yam missed another front end of a one-and-one with 26 seconds left, 
setting up Kroeger's tying score. 
</P>
<P>
 "It finally caught up with us," Century Coach Greg Coombs said. "You can't 
miss free throws like that in the playoffs and expect to win. But we had a 
great season. How many teams can say they won 23 games?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger helped Edison advance by scoring 16 points in the fourth quarter and 
overtime. Darrell Adams added 12 points and two three-pointers for the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division I-A game: 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 90, El Monte Arroyo 39 -- Clay McKnight and Miles Simon each scored 
21 points to lead top-seeded Mater Dei (28-0) at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight had five three-pointers and Simon had 11 assists for the Monarchs, 
who will play Moreno Valley Valley View -- a 71-67 winner in overtime over 
Moreno Valley Canyon Springs -- in the quarterfinals Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schea Cotton had 19 points and 12 rebounds and Shaun Jackson had 16 points and 
10 rebounds for Mater Dei, which led, 56-20, at halftime. Mater Dei is ranked 
second in the nation by USA Today.

ORANGE'S EDGE ON HOME COURT PROVES VALUABLE; DIVISION I-A: WITH A NOISY CROWD 
BEHIND THEM, THE PANTHERS PRODUCE A 69-61 VICTORY OVER CORONA.

 Never underestimate the power of hardwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange's famous home court turned into the Doom Dome for Corona on Friday 
night as the Panthers boys' basketball team advanced to the third round of the 
Division I-A Southern Section playoffs with a 69-61 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big key for us was the home court," said Orange Coach Richard 
Bossenmeyer. "The fans did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange's players didn't exactly slump. But for third-seeded Orange (22-3), a 
lift of the arms to signal crowd noise by the Orange's coaching staff is as 
effective as an admonition to box out. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Gonzales, who scored a game-high 24 points, said the cozy gym was worth 
seven or eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love to play here," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans enthusiastically backed Orange, especially in the fourth quarter. 
Corona's Randy Knoll tied the game at 45-45 on a turn around jumper to start 
the quarter, before Orange scored eight unanswered points for a 53-45 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Clutch Corona (21-5) free-throw shooting and a layup by Eric Knapp cut 
Orange's margin to four, 59-55, with 1:20 left. But Orange slowed down the 
tempo, Corona was forced to foul and Orange had a field day at the foul line, 
where the Panthers were 14 of 16 in the waning minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach makes us shoot 30 free throws a day," said Gonzales. "At the end of 
practice, if we don't make five in a row, or eight out of 10, we have to to 
stay and run." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Orange strong point was its accuracy from three-point range. Gonzales, 
who sported a 47% shooting average behind the arc going into the game, 
increased that number with Friday's performance. All of Gonzales' baskets, save 
for a layup in the fourth quarter, were three-pointers, including four in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange took a 24-18 lead after the first quarter, which Corona cut to 35-30 by 
halftime. In the third, Knapp converted a steal into a three-pointer to pull 
Corona to 45-43. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Harris added 14 points for Orange. Jonny McKee added 22 points for Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange will meet Edison in Tuesday's quarterfinals at a site to be determined.

game-winning free throw with four seconds left, as the Falcons defeated Long 
Beach Jordan, 51-50, Friday in a Southern Section Division I-AA second-round 
playoff game.

10 seconds left, he got the rebound and was fouled in the backcourt by Jordan's 
Robert Masing.Mann made the front end of a one-and-one, then Jordan's Brandon 
Boyd launched a half-court shot that bounced off the backboard and rim to end 
the game.

DIVISION IV BOYS' BASKETBALL; WHITTIER CHRISTIAN IS KNOCKED OFF BY DOWNEY PIUS 
X

<P>
 Downey Pius X finished in a three-way tie for third place in the Del Rey 
League and won the coin flip, thanks, in part, to the call of Principal Michael 
Parmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (12-12) then went out and upended highly regarded Whittier 
Christian, 68-56, in the opening round of the IV-A playoffs Friday at Los 
Angeles Chiropractic College. 
</P>
<P>
 "He beat me to the coin flip," Pius X Coach Deon Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 That turned out to be good for Pius X, but bad for Whittier Christian (21-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Downey Pius X put on a three-point shooting exhibition, especially in the 
second half, behind the likes of Allen Fletcher, Marcel Yates and Robert 
Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher finished with 17 points, Yates had 16 and Hargrove 11. 
</P>
<P>
 When the three weren't hurting Whittier Christian's defense from the outside, 
6-foot-7 Troy Collins did the damage inside and finished with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler Ream scored a game-high 23 points for Whittier Christian, including all 
12 of the Heralds' points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwadwo Bochie had 15. RUSSELL BANKS

COLD-SHOOTING LOYOLA LOSES TO SAN DIEGO 
</P>

<P>
 Three-point baskets were once a staple of the Loyola Marymount offense, but 
Friday night the Lions again showed just how far they have fallen in their 
long-range accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 With Loyola making two of 15 three-point shots, San Diego was able to turn 
back several rallies before pulling away in the final minute for an 89-82 West 
Coast Conference victory at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three-pointers have always been a weapon in our offense," Loyola Coach John 
Olive said. "The times we haven't hit our threes have really hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola, 5-17 overall and 4-7 in the WCC, missed all seven of its three-point 
attempts and shot 36% in the first half, when San Diego took a 46-35 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions rallied behind forward Wyking Jones, who scored a game-high 26 
points. They pulled within one three times in the second half. But each time, 
San Diego guard Joe Temple answered with either free throw or a basket. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toreros put the game away with an 8-0 run, including six free throws, 
after Loyola had pulled to within 81-79. ROB FERNAS

PEPPERDINE RECAPTURES WINNING FORM IN ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its basketball team reeling from three consecutive West Coast Conference 
losses, Pepperdine was hoping a win over second-place San Francisco would 
revive its sagging confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves may have received the boost with an 84-62 rout Friday night of the 
Dons before 1,534 at Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved Pepperdine (13-10, 5-6) into a three-way tie for fourth in 
the WCC, one game behind second-place San Francisco (14-8, 6-5) and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 In what has been a trying season, Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury could savor this 
one. At least until his team plays San Diego tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our energy level was as high as it's been in a long time, if not all year," 
Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 As inspired as Pepperdine played, San Francisco played perhaps its worst game 
since a 110-83 loss to Kentucky earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons took their last lead, 10-9, on a three-point basket by guard Gerald 
Walker with 16:10 remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Pepperdine went on a 13-0 spurt and never looked back. Behind 
seven three-pointers, four by point guard Bryan Parker and three by guard Damin 
Lopez, the Waves opened up a 49-25 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so frustrating for San Francisco Coach Jim Brovelli that he decided to 
start five reserves in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine was led by forward Dana Jones with 23 points and nine rebounds, 
Parker had 16 points and Lopez 12.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; SENIOR TRIO LEADS WAY FOR UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With seniors Detra Lockhart, Amy Jalewalia and Natalie Williams leading the 
way, the UCLA women's basketball team broke open a tight game and defeated 
Arizona, 85-69, on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Bruins' third consecutive Pacific 10 Conference victory, their 
fifth in six games and boosted their conference record to 8-4, 13-8 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 427 in the Wooden Center, Lockhart, a 5-foot-6 guard who made three 
three-point shots, single-handedly lifted the Bruins out of harm's way with 
seven minutes to go, after Arizona (12-9, 5-7) had cut an eight-point UCLA 
halftime lead to 63-61.  
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart made a 12-foot jump shot, an 18-footer, passed to Jalewalia for a 
basket and made two free throws to help the Bruins build the lead to 71-61 with 
4:39 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart scored a career-high 23 points and had eight assists and five steals 
in 28 minutes. Williams had 26 points and nine rebounds and Jalewalia had 10 
points, nine rebounds and six assists. EARL GUSTKEY

N. HOLLYWOOD EMPLOYS PRESS TO CLAIM TITLE; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: THREE-GUARD 
LINEUP HELPS HUSKIES COAST TO 67-56 VICTORY OVER GRANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 North Hollywood High basketball Coach Steve Miller didn't need the stress. He 
wasn't about to go through a repeat of last week's two-point, overtime victory 
over Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 That game was much too close for comfort. So Miller exchanged the Husky press 
that struggled against Grant last week for a quicker model -- and it roared 
like a mountain lion against the Lancers in an East Valley League finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant could not recover from nine first-quarter turnovers, and North Hollywood 
coasted to a 67-56 victory to claim the league championship. The second-place 
Lancers (18-5, 9-2) finished two games behind the Huskies (17-5, 11-0).  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a press we haven't used all year," Miller said. "We knew we had to 
show them something they've never seen before.' 
</P>
<P>
 Miller switched to a three-guard press to better match up with Grant's 
quickness. Mo Shivers was inserted in the starting lineup in place of Nelson 
Saenz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mo was the key," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant panicked under the pressure of the press in the first quarter, 
committing nine of its 16 turnovers in that period, while North Hollywood burst 
to a 21-14 lead it would never relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood's Damon Ollie, a 6-foot-5 senior center who was tripled-teamed 
in the Huskies two-point victory over Grant last week, broke free often in the 
rematch. Ollie finished with 20 points and 16 rebounds. The Lancers pulled to 
within five points three times in the final 4 minutes 50 seconds, but could get 
no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's Alvin Castro, however, did make it interesting. Castro, who scored 17 
of his team-high 20 points in the second half, hit three of his four 
three-point baskets during a three-minute stretch in the third quarter to pull 
the Lancers to within 41-34. But North Hollywood buried Grant with free throws 
in the fourth quarter. The Huskies converted 17 of 21 at the line in the final 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Lee (18 points) was eight of nine from the line in the final period. 
Fantasia Johnson added 17 points.

NORTHRIDGE HITTERS COME OUT SWINGING; COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL: FAST START POWERS 
MATADORS PAST LOYOLA, 15-2, 15-13, 15-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The way Cal State Northridge started out against Loyola Marymount on Friday 
night, one might have thought the entire Matador men's volleyball team was late 
for a dinner date. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it was Loyola's fault. Were the Lions sloppy on purpose, perhaps 
preferring to take a loss and bolt rather than stick around the newly 
christened "Epicenter," for fear of another aftershock? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, Northridge needed to work much harder in the last two 
games than it did the first one during a 15-2, 15-13, 15-10 sweep of Loyola in 
a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation match before 391. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game was over in 21 minutes. And it would not have lasted that long 
had the Lions not taken a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point on, however, the Matadors had the Lions by the tail. Or, as 
Northridge setter Gary Reznick put it, "Everyone was on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Heitmann, the Matadors' German import, was a commanding presence in the 
middle alongside Craig Hewitt. The 6-foot-7 twin towers were simply too tall 
and too physical for Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann, who came to Northridge from Hamburg, had 16 kills and had a 
match-high .581 hitting percentage. Hewitt had 14 kills and a .385 attacking 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, Jon Baer was not quite as effective percentage-wise, but he 
had 19 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Baer, making his debut as a starter, was not even on the Northridge roster two 
months ago. Last fall, he quit the team for what Price said were "personal 
reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-5 junior from Los Angeles rejoined the team in January and never skipped 
a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was never Mr. Ball Control to start with, and I expected him to take a 
while to get back in shape," Price said. "He's been a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, has been the play of Collin Smith. The freshman from Santa Cruz had 
11 digs for Northridge (5-3, 1-1 in conference play). 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions (3-8, 2-4) had their only look at the match when they had Northridge 
down, 11-6, in the second game. Loyola led, 9-8, in the third game, but Price 
at that point turned to his bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach summoned Chris McGee, a popular senior, and sent him in to replace 
Reznick. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge on Reznick: "He went away from our bread and butter," Price said. 
In other words, Hewitt and Heitmann weren't getting enough sets. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee changed that, ignited the crowd, and even served out the final two 
points of the match.

MASTER'S THWARTED BY A PAIR OF GUARDS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MUSTANGS CAN'T STOP 
BIOLA FROM PENETRATING AND FALL, 88-84, AS 13-GAME WINNING STREAK IS BROKEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An inability to keep the opposition off the offensive boards and to prevent a 
pair of fleet-footed guards from penetrating proved costly to The Master's 
College in a nonconference men's basketball game at Biola University on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being a half-step slow for much of the game, the Mustangs appeared to 
have a chance at sending the game into overtime down the stretch before losing, 
88-84, before 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss snapped Master's 13-game winning streak and was only its second 
defeat in its last 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't do anything to surprise us, but we just had a very difficult time 
containing those two guys (guards Darryl McMillon and Kevin Griffis)," Coach 
Bill Oates said. "And we didn't do a good job rebounding. They got too many 
second shots." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs (24-4), the No. 14-ranked team in the NAIA, trailed, 76-64, with 
seven minutes left before going on a 16-6 run to cut the deficit to 82-80 with 
1:49 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Penberthy, a freshman from Fresno Hoover High, keyed the surge by hitting 
four consecutive shots while scoring 10 of his 15 points, all of which came in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 McMillon, one of the Eagles' high-octane guards, nailed a leaping, 
double-pumping 10-footer in the lane to extend Biola's lead to four, but Emeka 
Okenwa hit an inside shot to cut the Mustangs' deficit to 84-82 with 1:15 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (21-9) made enough key plays after that to win, however. 
</P>
<P>
 First, McMillon hit one of two free throws with a minute remaining to give 
Biola a three-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Master's turnover, Griffis missed the front end of a one-and-one, but 
Chris Samdahl got the offensive rebound -- one of a career-high 16 rebounds for 
the 6-foot-6 senior -- before passing the ball to Griffis, who was fouled by 
Penberthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis (14 points) made one of two free throws to give Biola an 86-82 
advantage, but Master's appeared to be on the verge of cutting its deficit to 
two again when Okenwa went to the foul line for a pair of free throws with 20 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Okenwa, an 80% free-throw shooter entering the game, missed both shots -- his 
sixth and seventh miss of the game without a make -- and after a scramble for 
the loose ball, Samdahl fed a streaking Griffis for the layup with 10 seconds 
remaining that sealed the win for the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figured that we could take it to them one-on-one," Griffis said. "We 
thought we could do better by slashing through the lanes and dishing off if the 
shot wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
 James Mosley had a game-high 19 for Master's.

ROYAL'S SEASON ENDS AMID SERIES OF SOMBER WARNINGS; HIGH SCHOOL SOCCER: 
TOP-SEEDED HIGHLANDERS CAN'T WEATHER CHALLENGE BY EDISON IN FIRST ROUND, 4-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How's this for a series of portents? 
</P>
<P>
 As the Royal High boys' soccer team -- top-seeded in the Southern Section 
Division I playoffs -- prepared for its first-round match against Huntington 
Beach Edison on Friday, the skies began to cloud over. 
</P>
<P>
 As the match started, it started raining. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Edison jumped to a two-goal advantage in the first half, a brief 
hailstorm hit Royal's field. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitting. The Highlanders' season came to a dismal, stormy end in a 4-2 loss to 
the Chargers, who got three goals from senior forward Phil Urkov. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts the most of any year because we played a good solid game," said 
Royal Coach Kevin Corley, in his third season as the Highlander coach. "We just 
had some individuals in the back make some big mistakes. The kind of goals we 
let in really deflate a team. Their first goal was good. Their next three were 
not quality goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Charger players might argue. But there was no debating that Edison is a 
quality team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers finished third in the Sunset League behind powerhouses Santa Ana 
and Marina, so they earned a playoff berth as a wild-card entry -- which 
ordinarily connotes mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were a wild-card team in name only. The Chargers were ranked first in 
the division earlier this season, and they demolished Redondo, 8-1, in a 
Wednesday playoff match. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal's Corley and assistant Andy Silva attended that encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said, 'Oh, boy, this is going to be tough,' " Corley said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was. Urkov gave Edison (19-5-1) a 1-0 lead 10 minutes into the first 
half with a 15-yard shot to the lower left corner of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes later, Charger midfielder Brett Jorgenson got behind the 
Highlanders' defense and flicked a head ball over Highlander goalie Kevin 
Bell's outstretched hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal (21-4-3), which lost in the first round of the playoffs for the second 
consecutive year, closed to 2-1 at halftime on a penalty shot by Chris 
Fernandez, but Urkov scored twice in the second half. The first goal came on a 
rebound that Bell allowed to slip through his hands. The second came on a 
breakaway, and this shot also went off Bell's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great to beat somebody who's No. 1," Urkov said. "Because we were 
there earlier."

BREAKING THE SILENCE; PARENTS' MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR FOR PALMDALE'S SANDOVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After throwing an interception early in the game, Palmdale High quarterback 
Rocque Sandoval made eye contact with his father, John, high in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the clamor of the crowd, father calmed his son, telling him to refocus 
and play smart. Rocque (pronounced Rocky) understood every word, took the field 
and passed or ran for four touchdowns in Palmdale's 34-14 victory over 
Littlerock last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Well out of earshot, they were able to converse because John Sandoval cannot 
speak. Or hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither can Rocque's mother, Karen. Rocque and his three younger siblings -- 
all of whom have normal hearing -- communicate with their parents by sign 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I can see them, I can hear them," says Sandoval, a senior who 
plays center on the school's Golden League champion basketball team that will 
play a second-round playoff game tonight against Hart at The Master's College. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Sandoval, who threw a school-record 25 touchdown passes in the 
fall, accepted a football scholarship to New Mexico. He carries a 3.7 
grade-point average and plans to study premed. 
</P>
<P>
 Enormous achievements by a young man who has overcome extraordinary obstacles. 
Coaches and friends sing his praises. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet from his parents' standpoint, the theme from Rocque is complete silence. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Karen Sandoval cheer their son as wildly as the most leather-lunged 
fan, leaping out of their seats and exchanging hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the crowd roars, they get into it like other people," Rocque says. "They 
can tell when a touchdown is scored or a big shot is made. 
</P>
<P>
 "And after games, I see what kind of expressions they make." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen, especially, is expressive in all sorts of nonverbal ways, exuding 
enthusiasm and warmth through gestures and a delightful twinkle in her eyes. 
John is more stoic, yet pride in his son is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview this week around their living room table, the Sandovals 
were downright talkative, jabbering on by punctuating their rapid signing with 
riveting eye contact and animated facial expressions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocque, who began signing before he could crawl, concentrates on his parents' 
signing with the same intensity he must use recognizing defensive coverages. He 
answers them quickly, his large hands spelling any word he is unable to sign, 
his neck bobbing, his entire body devoted to the task. 
</P>
<P>
 Deprived of a whisper and a scream, the Sandovals engage in the very essence 
of nonverbal communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom and Dad are proud of me," Rocque says, translating his parents' signing. 
"That I'm a success. That I made it. That I earned a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad says I am a really hard worker." 
</P>
<P>
 That said, John and Karen turn to a listener and smile broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Signing comes in especially handy during football and basketball games. How 
many thousands of fathers yearn to talk to their sons during competition? 
</P>
<P>
 John Sandoval, a man living in silence, is able to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his son, he played high school football (yes, quarterback) and basketball 
(averaging 28 points a game). He attended the California School for the Deaf in 
Berkeley, where he met Karen, his wife of 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad knows what is going on," Rocque says. "He knows sports. He's got an 
impressive scrapbook himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Like father, like son. Rocque was among state leaders with 2,675 passing yards 
last year, his first as a starting quarterback. He racked up nine sacks as a 
junior defensive end, but made the transition from pass rusher to pass thrower 
look startlingly easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval (6-foot-2, 185 pounds) learns quickly, something his parents have 
known since he began to sign for milk and water at the age of eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look what he's done in one year," says Jeff Williams, the Palmdale football 
coach. "He's in watching film as much as any coach on our staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rocque is a very intelligent quarterback. He's done things in the last year 
that usually take three years to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 On the basketball court, Sandoval more than holds his own against taller 
players through positioning and toughness. Turns out those days as a defensive 
end come in handy on the hardwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "He plays inside and always covers the opposing team's top big man," says 
Palmdale basketball Coach Garry Phelps, whose team is 22-3 and ranked No. 3 in 
The Times' area poll. "He uses the strength he developed through football." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocque is smart. Rocque is tough. And Rocque is under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in a household where a gentle tap on the shoulder gains 
immeasurably better results than yelling, Sandoval learned restraint. He has 
passed on that knowledge to his brother, Vince, 14, and sisters Kim, 10, and 
Melissa, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls one shouting match with Vince, a 6-4, 230-pound Palmdale freshman 
tight end. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad actually heard us. You have to yell loud for him to hear you, and it 
hurt his ears," Sandoval says, wincing at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Being acutely aware of what a person is feeling is another product of 
Sandoval's upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 His expression darkens at the memory of last week's basketball game at 
Antelope Valley. A fan made fun of John Sandoval's inability to hear and speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me want to go over there and beat the crap out of them," Rocque 
says, laughing nervously at the thought of doing something that cuts across the 
grain of his personality. 
</P>
<P>
 He throws up his hands. "I mean, show some respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval could be excused for being reluctant to take off for college. But he 
and his parents scoff at any notion that he is needed at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family is the same as anyone else's family," he says as his parents nod in 
agreement. "There is nothing strange about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The familiarity of New Mexico attracted Sandoval, who won't turn 18 until 
October and plans to redshirt next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its appeals: topography similar to Palmdale and a substantial deaf 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll try to get credit for signing as a second language and I might work as 
an interpreter for other students," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Sandoval is studying at Antelope Valley College to be a counselor for 
children who cannot hear. When she earns her degree, the family might relocate 
to Oregon, where they believe job opportunities are greater for her and John, a 
construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
 That would take them even farther from their oldest son. If they live in 
Palmdale, they plan to attend New Mexico games at Fresno State and San Diego 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, Rocque can simply write about the game and send it electronically over 
the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has a typewriter-like instrument called a Telecommunications Device 
for the Deaf attached to their phone that enables them to type a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocque re-enacts the few Palmdale games his parents have missed in either 
sport. He brings the games to life in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I act out what happened," he says as his parents grin gleefully at the 
memory. "I'll stand here and actually show them how I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen and John laugh without making a sound. They look lovingly at their son, 
then at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 So much unspoken. So much conveyed.

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION IV BOYS' SOCCER; SUNNY HILLS CAN'T PREVENT HISTORY 
FROM REPEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunny Hills Coach Mike Schade has to be wondering what he did to the Southern 
Section seeding committee to deserve this. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years of playing Sea View teams in the first round, five losses. The 
latest, a 3-1 defeat Friday to Saddleback in the Southern Section Division IV 
boys' soccer playoffs in Santa Ana, was closer than it appeared. Nonetheless, 
Sunny Hills' season is over, courtesy of the Sea View League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was standing here last year in about this same spot talking to reporters 
about our troubles with the Sea View League," Schade said. "Sunny Hills played 
a great game (Friday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Just not quite great enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills took a 1-0 lead six minutes into the second half on a spectacular 
Chris Roselli goal off a nice feed from Nick Walton. But it evaporated 12 
minutes later when sweeper Oscar Cisneros lined a shot, from about 30 yards 
out, past a diving Jeff Murphy. The goal even appeared to shock Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coach told me I had to go up, because we had to pressure them," Cisneros 
said. "My partner (Juan Arreola) kicked it right to me and I just hit it. It 
was some 20 meters out. I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Within 10 minutes, Saddleback was on the board again when Ramon Alvarado 
rebounded Abdias Avila's shot. Juan Maldonado finished the scoring with three 
minutes left when he scored off a throw-in from Avila. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like when the other team scores on us, the kids really pick up the 
tempo," Saddleback Coach Mel Silva said. "Our league is so tough. We've been 
behind before to good teams and pulled games out." 
</P>
<P>
 Schade said he saw the Saddleback outburst coming, but he felt helpless in 
trying to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the depth of their team and they're so big and strong up front, I knew 
it was just a matter of time," Schade said. "They just have too much 
firepower." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Division IV games: 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra 4, Norwalk 1 -- Hugo Estrella, Miguel Garcia, John Mendrin and Mark 
Lamb each scored and Javier Flores had four saves for La Habra (11-5-5), which 
handed Norwalk (14-1-2) its first loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders will play the winner of La Verne Bonita-San Bernardino Cajon 
in the second round Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita 2, Moreno Valley Valley View 0 -- Chon Kantikovit and Matt 
Blasdel each scored and Brian Casola and Mike Greco each had two saves to lead 
visiting Santa Margarita (14-4-5). Santa Margarita will play the winner of 
Corona Centennial-La Mirada in the second round on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora 2, Lakewood Mayfair 1 (3 OT) -- Chris Fernandez scored off a penalty 
kick in the third overtime to give Sonora the victory. Fernandez scored both 
goals for Sonora (16-3-3). His first goal came off an assist assist by Paul 
Copeland five minutes into the game. Mayfair tied the score, 1-1, with 23 
minutes remaining in the first half on a crossing header by Joe Gritl. Mayfair 
finishes 13-8-4.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob McClung scored a game-high 24 points and Dave Vaccaro was three blocks

 Vaccaro scored 11 of Liberty's 19 first-quarter points, and 15 of the team's 
33 in the first half, as the Minutemen opened a 33-19 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave Vaccaro came to play," Coach Rudy Sass said. "He kept us going in the 
first half." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks (10-8) were led by Roldan Chapple, with 15 points, and Danny 
Chapple (14). 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Shores got as close as 11 points when Tim Collins made a three-pointer 
to start the third quarter, but Liberty scored the next eight points to open a 
41-22 lead and was never threatened again. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division V-AA game: 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana Ambassador Christian 93, Southern California Christian 60 -- No. 
3-seeded Ambassador improved to 20-5. Southern California Christian finished

EDISON UPSETS TOP-SEEDED SIMI VALLEY ROYAL

 What a difference a year can make. 
</P>
<P>
 This time last season, Marina was storing its soccer gear after missing the 
playoffs for only the second time in nine years.Meanwhile, Fontana was 
stringing together victories en route to a Southern Section boys' title. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, it was Fontana's turn to pack up early as fourth-seeded Marina scored 
three first-half goals and defeated the Steelers, 4-1, in a Division I 
first-round game at Marina High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (16-5-1) advance to play Claremont, the Baseline League 
second-place team, in Thursday's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first playoff game is the hardest because of the nerves," Viking Coach 
David McLeish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina looked relaxed, taking a 1-0 lead in the opening minute when Joe 
Borzoni beat Fontana goalkeeper Omar Hernandez to his left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings added to their lead 15 minutes later, when Borzoni's cross pass 
skipped past Jose Monroy, his intended target, but was knocked in by a hustling 
Jason Benwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Benwell scored again in the first half when he used his knee to direct a cross 
pass into the net and Marina led comfortably, 3-0, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroy, the Vikings' leading scorer, scored the fourth goal when he made a 
pair of fancy moves around two Steeler defenders and hit the corner of the net 
with a shot off his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana finished 15-7-5. DAN ARRITT

COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; IRVINE VALLEY PLAYS SPOILER FOR 
SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback, which held a one-game lead with four left, lost its bid for even a 
share of the Orange Empire Conference men's basketball title Friday when it was 
upset, 81-80, by Irvine Valley at Capistrano Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (21-8, 11-3 in conference) started the game tied with Riverside. 
But the Tigers beat Cypress, 79-70, to claim the title outright. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley, which had lost five in a row, got the winning basket with 13 
seconds left when Eugene Patterson picked up a loose ball and made a 10-foot 
baseline jumper to put the Lasers up, 81-80. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, who seldom plays, was in the game because three Irvine Valley 
players had fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback moved the ball up court, and called a timeout with eight seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos got the ball to Tes Whitlock in the corner, but his three-point 
attempt bounced away and time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley Coach Bill Mulligan, between shaking hands and being hugged by 
well-wishers, agreed that it was biggest victory in the two-year history of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't do anything special for me," Mulligan said about beating 
Saddleback and preventing the Gauchos from winning a second consecutive title. 
"I just wanted to beat somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback opened a 30-23 lead with about six minutes left in the first half 
but failed to score the rest of the half. Tom Airey (21 points, all on 
three-pointers) made on consecutive shots to start the Lasers' comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley (18-14, 6-8) led at half, 38-30. The Lasers finished the 
conference race tied for fifth with Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback turned to sophomores Antoine Jefferson (25 points) and Whitlock (30 
points) in the second half to rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos controlled the flow early in the second half and were up, 53-47, 
with about 10 minutes left. But then it was Irvine Valley's turn to rally. 
Rashad Wilson, who was a backup defensive back for the Saddleback football team 
last fall, had 22 for Irvine Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback was in trouble even before the start of the game, when starting 
guard Derrick Walsh walked in wearing street clothes. Walsh, who had scored a 
career-high 25 Wednesday, sat on the bench, but Coach Bill Brummel wouldn't say 
why he didn't play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have no comment," Brummel said. "I hope to be able to say more 
Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 99, Golden West 76 -- Kevin Carlson led the Hornets (25-10, 8-6) 
with 34 points and Eddie Cochran had 21 points and 11 rebounds. Fullerton and 
Rancho Santiago tied for third, but Fullerton will be seeded higher in the 
playoffs because the Hornets beat the Dons twice.  
</P>
<P>
 Chris Reiff had 23 points and Gerald Rhoden had 21 for Golden West (9-21, 
2-12). 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago 88, Orange Coast 83 -- Sean Amos had 23 points and seven 
rebounds, Matt Kordik added 20, and Nathan Small had 19 points and seven 
rebounds to lead visiting Rancho Santiago (20-11, 8-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Loewe scored 19 points, including four three-pointers, and Damion Morbley 
added 18 points and 12 rebounds for Orange Coast (13-16, 3-11). 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange Empire Conference women's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West 71, Fullerton 51 -- The Hornets threw a celebration to honor 
Colleen Riley's last regular-season game as coach, but Golden West spoiled the 
party. Golden West (29-4, 11-1) clinched its fifth consecutive conference title 
earlier. Fullerton (19-14, 7-5) finished in a third-place tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast 70, Rancho Santiago 56 -- Leann Karmeo led Orange Coast (19-12, 
7-5) with 18 points and 17 rebounds. Rancho Santiago finished 3-20, 0-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside 77, Cypress 63 -- Riverside dominated from the beginning with strong 
shooting from Audrey McMurry (22 points). Sara Works had 21 points for Cypress 
(22-9, 7-5), which lost the battle for second in the conference.

EXPORTS TO JAPAN IN JEOPARDY, SAY STATE'S FARMERS; TRADE: SOME LEADERS FEAR 
MEDFLY INFESTATION WILL TIP JAPANESE TOWARD BOYCOTT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With trade tensions intensifying between the United States and Japan, farmers 
in California -- growers of the produce favored by the dreaded Mediterranean 
fruit fly -- are afraid of becoming an easy target in what may become a 
bruising struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 And a new University of California study says if Japan follows through on a 
threat to boycott California produce, it would cost the state's 
export-dependent farm economy dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the recent collapse of trade talks between the two countries, 
Japan was threatening a boycott of the state's produce because of the return of 
the Medfly to parts of California. Just last month, the American Embassy in 
Tokyo was warning Washington of "a very critical situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, aerial spraying has finally begun in Riverside County to kill the 
Medfly, a step Japan had urged. But the general trade climate has worsened 
dramatically, and the state's farm lobby fears a boycott would be seen by the 
Japanese as an effective way to respond to President Clinton's recent trade 
complaint over Japan's treatment of U.S. cellular-phone makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture trade officials in Washington say they consider retaliation 
unlikely, but California farm leaders -- having just won a hard-fought battle 
to ship the state's rice to Japan -- are deeply concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The threat is very real," says Bob Vice, president of the California Farm 
Bureau. "Frankly, we've always known that's the way the Japanese would 
retaliate: in agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a boycott would quickly spread to other Far East nations and trim overall 
farm revenues by $564 million while cutting deeply into the plum and citrus 
business, slashing revenues for Valencia oranges alone by 55%, the UC Berkeley 
study says. 
</P>
<P>
 The short-term result would be sharply lower profits or operating losses for 
growers, shippers and packers, while an embargo of more than two years would 
cause "a significant loss in acres, jobs and assets" for about 20 crops, said 
the report by economist Jerome B. Siebert at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Medfly became established in the state, the total losses could reach 
some $1.4 billion a year because of the Far East boycott and other continuing 
costs of fighting the infestation, the study said. California farmers take in 
about $18 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Siebert said a boycott by Japan is especially worrisome because Korea, Taiwan 
and Hong Kong normally follow Japan's lead in these matters. That could spread 
alarm to other regions and to other parts of the United States, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Rim has swollen in importance to California agriculture, 
especially citrus. Fully 60% of the products sold by Sunkist, the state's giant 
citrus cooperative, are exported to Asia. Japan is Sunkist's biggest single 
export market, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After repeated efforts to block the aerial spraying of the insecticide 
malathion, the spraying began Tuesday over an 18-square-mile area of Corona and 
Norco in Riverside County. American Embassy officials in Japan had been urging 
such action. 
</P>
<P>
 A top official in the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday downplayed the 
likelihood of retaliation as a motive for a Japanese boycott, and said he 
expects no action unless the Medfly spreads. 
</P>

 "As long as the trappings (of the pest) are confined to that region, our 
concerns are lessened," said Richard Schroeter, acting administrator of the 
USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service. "The action taken by the state of 
California, the aerial spraying, give us optimism here."

<P>
 The specific products that would be affected by an embargo are fresh apples, 
apricots, avocados, bell peppers, sweet cherries, dates, figs, table grapes, 
grapefruit, kiwis, lemons, limes, tangerines, oranges, nectarines, peaches, 
pears, persimmons, plums and tomatoes.

 Nearly a third of those California crops were exported in 1992, bringing in 
$605 million, the UC Berkeley study said. More than half that total came from 
Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Impact on California

BOND YIELDS LEAP ON FEARS OF INFLATION, HIGHER INTEREST; MARKETS: SOME 
SOUTHLAND LENDERS RAISE MORTGAGE RATES. BLUE-CHIP PRICES TUMBLE FOR THE SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fears that inflation and interest rates could rise again soon sent bond yields 
soaring Friday to the highest levels since last summer, triggering a modest 
selloff in stocks and prompting some Southern California lenders to raise their 
mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp rise in bond yields -- the second in two days -- puts pressure on 
rates to rise throughout the economy, which could boost the cost of borrowing 
for businesses and consumers and dampen future economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond shot up to 6.63%, the highest since 
last July and up from 6.54% Thursday and 6.48% Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield rise sent blue-chip stocks tumbling for the second session in a row, 
with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 35.18 points to close at 3,887.46. 
For the week, the index was off 7.32 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid rise in interest rates had some veteran traders wondering if the 
bond market's long rally is about to run out of gas. Bond prices fall when 
rates rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to pronounce this the beginning of the bear market," said 
Russell Abbott, a bond trader at First Boston Corp. "But it is exhibiting many 
of the characteristics of bear trading." 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp rise in bond yields was triggered by concerns that the Federal 
Reserve Board may soon raise short-term rates again to keep long-term inflation 
in check. Traders were also still reacting to a report issued Thursday showing 
that some manufacturers are beginning to pay higher prices for raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, traders were gearing up for Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's 
testimony before Congress on Tuesday. (Financial markets will be closed Monday 
for the Presidents' Day holiday.) A few days after Greenspan's last 
congressional appearance, on Jan. 31, the Fed boosted the key federal funds 
rate by a quarter-point and touched off a 96-point drop in the Dow Jones 
industrials. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year bond has risen more than 0.3 percentage points since the Fed 
raised the federal funds rate. Rates on 30-year mortgages were at an average 
6.97% just before the Fed moved. This week, they averaged 7.11%, the Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of Southern California lenders raised their rates on fixed 30-year 
mortgages by about one-eighth of a point on Thursday, and a few more followed 
suit on Friday. Rates now are generally between 7.125% and 7.375%, up from 7% 
about three weeks ago. The latest rate hike would add about $13 to the monthly 
payment on a $150,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Joseph Conrad, a director of the Los Angeles County Assn. of Mortgage 
Brokers, said the rate hike probably had more to do with the arrival of a 
three-day weekend than with the selloff in the bond market. Most financial 
institutions will be closed Monday for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some lenders raise their rates a little at the start of a three-day weekend, 
just to give themselves a little protection in case something happens before 
they reopen on Tuesday," said Conrad, a broker and president of the Spectrum 
Group in Woodland Hills. "Rates might go back down a little next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most economists say mortgage rates will climb at least a quarter-point 
and perhaps more than half a point by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still believe the trend is for rates to rise, though slightly over the 
course of the year," said Robert Van Order, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corp.'s chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
 As for stocks, their outlook will depend in part on how much further rates 
will rise, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 A.C. Moore, stock market analyst at SBCM/Argus, said interest rates would have 
to move a half to a full percentage point higher before having an impact on 
what he described as stocks' primary positive trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interest rates can go up a good bit more before that becomes a problem," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues beat advances 1,412 to 702 on New York 
Stock Exchange volume of more than 289 million shares. The Nasdaq Stock Market 
composite index slid 1.39 to 788.85 but gained 7.46 in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Economically sensitive cyclical stocks, which have rallied recently on the 
view they will benefit most from the economy's expansion, lost ground. Among 
cyclical stocks, Chrysler shed 3/4 to 57 7/8, Caterpillar dropped 5/8 to 108 
1/8 and Whirlpool was off 7/8 to 68 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scripps-Howard shot up 7 to 82 after E.W. Scripps offered to buy the 14% of 
the company's stock it did not already own. E.W. Scripps offered three of its 
class A common shares for each Scripps-Howard share. E.W. Scripps ended off 1/8 
to 28 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shares in Mexican telecommunications company Telefonos de Mexico dropped 2 
1/4 to 71 3/8, topping the NYSE's most active list. Traders pinned the drop to 
investors' concern about declines in world stock markets and profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's Financial Times 100 index ended down 42.7 points at 
3,382.6. Frankfurt's DAX index closed at 2,151.97, up 1.09% or 23.25 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's Nikkei average finished 28.21 points, or 0.15%, higher at 18,959.60 
but showed a loss of 1,031.1 points since last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar fell against most European currencies amid disappointment in its 
failure to sustain a rally earlier in the week on news of a German rate cut. 
The dollar was quoted at 1.7133 marks in late New York trading, down from 
1.7265 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar managed to post a minor gain against the yen after Japanese 
officials said they plan steps to make markets more open to U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold plunged, leading other metals lower. Traders said a plunge in bond 
prices, potential violence in South Africa, and faltering trade talks in Japan 
have all failed to spark new demand for gold. Gold bullion fell $2.70 on New 
York's Commodity Exchange, where the most-active April contract settled at 
$381.60 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy futures prices were mostly higher Friday in very light trading ahead 
of the three-day weekend. Light sweet crude oil for delivery in March settled 
at $14.21 per barrel, down 2 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

BARGAIN CENTRAL; DEVELOPERS PROPOSE HUGE OUTLET MALLS IN URBAN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, factory outlet malls have stuck to out-of-the way places like 
Cabazon and Barstow, where manufacturers can sell their wares without 
alienating full-price retailers clustered in regional shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 A few like The Citadel, which opened in 1990 in City of Commerce, have popped 
up in urban areas as manufacturers tested the outlet concept, but they were the 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a handful of off-price centers are being proposed that could put hundreds 
of factory outlets and discount retail stores in the very heart of urban Orange 
and Los Angeles counties, potentially changing the way Southern Californians 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 An East Coast developer is betting that it can resuscitate The City Mall, a 
struggling regional center in Orange that for years has lost customers and 
merchants to newer malls nearby. Mills Corp., a privately held company based in 
Washington, already has four outlet malls -- in Fort Lauderdale, Chicago, 
Philadelphia and suburban Washington -- that together generate $1 billion in 
annual sales and include Nordstrom, Bugle Boy, Sharper Image and Ann Taylor 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, which proposes transforming The City Mall into a million-square-foot 
center with 12 anchor stores and 169 specialty shops, also wants to build an 
outlet mall in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 And Century City developer Robert Sonnenblick plans to build a pair of "value 
outlet super malls" of 1.2 million square feet each in Carson and Colton. The 
Carson City Council in December approved a plan to help finance Sonnenblick's 
LA Metro Mall, which would be at the interchange of the San Diego and Harbor 
freeways. The center is to include half a dozen anchor stores, hundreds of 
outlet shops and a massive food court. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics from Value Retail News, a trade publication, indicate that U.S. 
consumers are hungry for bargains. While conventional retailing stalled during 
the recession, sales at outlet stores grew to $8.3 billion in 1992, up 12% from 
$7.4 billion the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail industry experts say that value-oriented outlet centers can succeed 
even in areas already awash in malls. "We're going to see an increasing mix of 
different kinds of malls," said Linda Crowley, an Irvine-based retail industry 
consultant. "And the consumer will be the winner, with better prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Outlet centers aren't for everyone. Harried shoppers seeking a specific item 
-- say, size 38 Calvin Klein underwear -- probably will stick with the 
convenience of well-stocked stores in regional shopping malls. Outlet centers 
cater to consumers who have time to spare and are looking for an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an entertaining day," said Courtney Lord, a Washington-based mall 
developer who is building centers in San Jose and Seattle. "You'll find brand 
names at great prices. But you'll have to work at your purchases and be willing 
to accept substitutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The new centers aren't going to drive well-established malls out of business, 
developers say. Consumers think of their neighborhood malls "sort of like your 
Main Street," Lord said. "You're in and out of them maybe 40 or 50 times each 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, only the hardiest shoppers make more than two or three trips a 
year to the outlet centers. "Instead of running in for a half hour at your 
regional mall and spending 30 bucks, you'll spend three hours and 400 bucks," 
Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some retail analysts doubt that even heavily populated Southern California 
can support more than two or three outlet malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Orange and Carson proposals already face obstacles. Mills Corp. says 
in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it intends to 
finance The City Mall project with funds generated by a real estate investment 
trust. But the SEC documents show that the company lost money in each of the 
past four years and, like many developers, has a heavy debt load. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers note that Mills has yet to begin work on a similar mall 
that it proposed in the late 1980s for Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carson center, which developer Sonnenblick says will open by 1996, is to 
be built on a 76-acre landfill that's contaminated with heavy metals and 
solvents. Carson officials, eager for the $3 million in annual sales tax 
receipts that the outlet mall is expected to generate, approved a plan to help 
Sonnenblick pay for the cleanup. But the developer has yet to submit a plan to 
the state Department of Toxic Control. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who think new giant off-price centers can thrive question whether 
the Orange and Carson sites are right. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we think there's a place for outlet malls, whether or not these 
locations will work has yet to be determined," said Jan M. Wohlwend, general 
manager of Anaheim Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Plaza briefly considered converting to an outlet center but abandoned 
the idea after determining that "top-of-the-line outlets wouldn't want to 
locate so close to existing regional malls," Wohlwend said. Instead, Anaheim 
Plaza is rebuilding itself as a so-called power center with stores like of 
Wal-Mart, Comp USA and Ross, which offer name brands at cut-rate prices. 
Developer Lord, a strong proponent of outlet malls, acknowledges that the 
outlet-center concept is evolving. "We're still writing the book on how to get 
merchandise to consumers for less," he said. But consumers, he said, "want us 
to give them more for less, and this is one way to do it."

CREDIT CARD WAR ERUPTS AT OLYMPICS; ADVERTISING: IOC ACCUSES AMERICAN EXPRESS 
CO. OF 'AMBUSH MARKETING' IN CAMPAIGN AIMED AT RIVAL VISA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The International Olympic Committee lashed out Friday at American Express Co., 
accusing the company of being a parasite at the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument over what the IOC called "ambush marketing" stems from an 
American Express television commercial promoting the availability of its 
services in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 A voice-over says: "So if you're traveling to Norway, you'll need a passport 
but you don't need a Visa." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad angered both the IOC and rival company Visa, which is an official 
Olympic sponsor with exclusive rights to provide credit card services at Games 
venues. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express was giving a misleading impression it had an Olympic 
connection and had refused to withdraw the ad campaign, the IOC said. The 
committee said it would allow Visa to retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the fifth successive Olympic Games in which American Express has 
falsely implied such a connection," said IOC executive board member Dick Pound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, it appears to be American Express corporate policy, 
deliberately established at the highest level, to try to appropriate the 
goodwill of the Olympics without in any way supporting them. 
</P>
<P>
 "American Express does no service to itself, to its members, to athletes and 
the American public by pretending to hide behind customer service during a 
blatant parasite campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 American Express responded by saying the IOC was engaged in a campaign of 
intimidation and vowed it would not bow to what it said were empty threats. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express spokesman Frank Vaccaro said in Lillehammer that the company 
was countering its rival's campaign to lead the public to believe only Visa 
cards could be used at the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Visa's advertising suggested only its cards would be accepted at the Olympics, 
whereas American Express was welcomed at virtually all hotels, restaurants and 
tourist shops in Lillehammer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "American Express does not require permission from Visa or the IOC to serve 
our card members or to let them know we are present in Norway," he said. "We 
have been in Norway since 1916 and operate customer services throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "A $40-million sponsorship payment by Visa to the IOC will not change that," 
he said. "Visa's purchase of the Olympic rings is not a license to mislead 
consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaccaro said American Express advertising used no Olympic symbols or imagery 
nor did it depict any sports events. 
</P>
<P>
 Visa Senior Vice President John Bennett said in a statement: "Visa stands by 
the accuracy of our advertising. Visa is the only card accepted at the 1994 
Olympic Winter Games." 
</P>
<P>
 IOC Marketing Director Michael Payne said he believed American Express, a 
former Olympic sponsor, was regretting ending its connection with the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're feeling the pinch on sponsorship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said there had been other examples of ambush marketing at the Games. He 
said a third credit card company, Mastercard, had withdrawn 200,000 maps of the 
Olympic region. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota Motor Corp. stopped an ad in Australia suggesting it supported the 
Australian team in Lillehammer after the country's Olympic committee got a 
court injunction, he added.

STRANGE SONY-PETERS PARTNERSHIP REACHES AN END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a rocky five-year marriage that cost hundreds of millions of dollars, 
Sony Pictures Entertainment has given producer Jon Peters his freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony announced Friday that Peters will be allowed to work at other studios 
under a new, non-exclusive deal. The mercurial producer, who never fit into the 
corporate culture at Sony, is widely expected to go back to Warner Bros., where 
he scored his biggest hit with "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, 46, declined comment on his plans Friday. But a return to Warner would 
be seen as ironic, since Sony fought an expensive legal battle with the studio 
to obtain Peters and his former partner, Peter Guber, as co-chairmen in 1989. 
Sony paid more than $500 million in penalties to Warner for making the deal 
while Guber and Peters were still under contract there. In addition to that, it 
paid about $200 million for Guber Peters Entertainment Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about Peters returning to his old stomping ground reportedly 
complicated his exit talks. Sony had no comment on Friday, beyond a terse press 
release in which it said Peters will remain a "special and important member of 
its creative family." Sources expect the studio to go ahead with such 
high-profile Peters projects as "Money Train," possibly starring Wesley Snipes 
and Woody Harrelson, and "Gangland," based on the life of John Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the 12-member staff of Peters Entertainment will remain Sony-based. 
Peters also is on good terms with Guber and Mark Canton, chairman of 
Columbia-TriStar Motion Pictures Companies. 
</P>
<P>
 His departure ends one of Hollywood's strangest partnerships. Much of the 
entertainment community was stunned when Sony Corp., the Japanese electronics 
giant, named Peters and Guber co-chairmen after buying the studio for $3.4 
billion plus sizable debt. While Guber had executive experience, Peters was 
mostly known for his creative skills, having co-produced such hits as "Missing" 
and "Rain Man," in addition to the enormously successful "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
 As a former hairdresser and boyfriend of Barbra Streisand, Peters also had a 
reputation for being tight with talent -- counting Michael Jackson and Jack 
Nicholson among his close friends -- and for having a hair-trigger temper when 
it came to protecting his interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony tried to put a good face on its decision, even after the messy legal 
entanglement with Warner. But Peters never found his niche as an executive. He 
feuded frequently with Sony brass over everything from his ambitious movie 
ideas to his desire to build a Sony theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Things reached an impasse by 1991, when Sony announced that Guber would become 
sole chairman, with Peters accepting a production deal. While Peters 
subsequently spent about $15 million developing "Gangland" and other 
high-profile projects, nothing reached fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 One project, "Mistress of the Seas," fell apart over financial and creative 
disagreements. Others never moved forward. Sources say Peters was frustrated by 
Sony's cautious attitude toward spending, especially in the wake of flops such 
as "Last Action Hero." He also remained embittered about his earlier 
experiences, friends say. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came there to run the company, not to make movies," said one source. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters is expected to spend the next several months lining up financing to 
support his new production company. Rumors that he will rejoin Warner are also 
fueled by the fact that he's very friendly with Warner Bros. President Terry 
Semel. But sources say nothing has been formally decided, since Peters 
apparently wants to get back into filmmaking in a big way.

OFF THE TICKER: ZAPPING ADS INTO 8 SECONDS OF BLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Iggulden of Santa Clarita had a tired fast-forward finger. So he 
invented a device, set to hit stores in June, to zap advertising from 
videotaped television programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The price: $199 for the box called Commercial Break that hooks up to VCRs, 
said Richard Leifer, president of manufacturer Arista Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Iggulden's device lets a VCR record a program, then makes a map of where the 
ads are. You play back the tape, and the device fast-forwards the ads. All you 
see is eight seconds of blue screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony isn't lost on Leifer. "When sales go up," he said, "we'll actually 
run a television commercial for a product that gets rid of television 
commercials."

 Group Makes Offer for America West: Air Partners, the investor group that 
brought Continental Airlines Inc. out of bankruptcy court, has made an offer 
for America West Airlines, a spokesman for the group said.In addition, 
Continental and the New Mexico-based regional carrier Mesa Airlines are said to 
be considering joining in the bid. Investors David Bonderman and James Coulter 
of Fort Worth, Tex., formed Air Partners last year and joined with Air Canada 
to bail out Continental in return for a majority stake. A spokesman for Air 
Partners said the offer already has expired, but the investors group said it is 
still interested. Continental and Mesa would be minority investors in America 
West.

 Viacom, Blockbuster May Revise Merger Terms: Viacom Inc. and Blockbuster 
Entertainment Corp. may revise the terms of their merger agreement in the wake 
of declining stock values of both companies. Wall Street analysts said the 
value of the Viacom-Blockbuster merger has declined to $5 billion from $8.4 
billion when the merger was announced last month, forcing both companies back 
to the negotiating table.Blockbuster's stock has tumbled nearly 40%. 
Blockbuster shareholders are expected to pressure Viacom to sweeten its offer, 
and may possibly recruit TV broadcaster Chris-Craft Industries to buy 
Blockbuster shares in exchange for some of the merged companies' assets. 
Blockbuster is part of a three-way merger with Viacom, which just won the 
five-month-long takeover battle for Paramount Communications.

 Sega Forecasts Profit Decline: Sega Enterprises, the aggressive Japanese video 
game maker that eclipsed archrival Nintendo Co. in the U.S. market last year, 
forecast its first drop in profits in 12 years.It cited the soaring yen, the 
recession in Europe and intensified competition in its home market. Those 
factors, combined spwith heavy spending to develop theme parks, advanced 
computer game machines and electronic toys, will probably cause its earnings in 
the fiscal year ending March 31 to fall to $408 millio9n, off nearly 23% from 
$529 million last year. It had previously forecast profits of $552 million.

<P>
 For the person who only wants to talk to some of the people some of the time, 
Pacific Bell has introduced a call-blocking service called "Do Not Disturb." 
</P>
<P>
 The service allows customers to block calls from people who don't know a 
prearranged four-letter password.If callers know the password, the call goes 
through. If not, they're told to call back later or leave a message at the 
beep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Participants use their home phones to change their password and turn the 
service on or off just as often as they like," said Jennifer Brunn of Pacific 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is currently letting about 200 customers in Southern California 
try the service out for free as part of a trial. If the trial goes as expected, 
Pacific Bell plans to offer "Do Not Disturb" for about $3.50 to $4.00 a month.

 Blinder Top Candidate for Fed Post: Alan Blinder, a member of President 
Clinton's economic brain trust and former Princeton University economist, is 
the leading candidate to take the No. 2 post at the Federal Reserve, 
Administration officials said.The position at the powerful central bank 
unexpectedly opened up early this month with the departure of David Mullins. 
Blinder, 48, has served the past year on the White House's Council of Economic 
Advisers. As Fed vice chairman, Blinder would play a major role in determining 
the direction of interest rates and the economy and would de facto be a top 
candidate to take over as head of the central bank when Alan Greenspan's term 
ends in 1996.

U.S. LETS BAY AREA FIRMS FORM HEALTH CO-OP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 The Justice Department said it won't object to plans by a Bay Area coalition 
of big employers to negotiate jointly for the purchase of health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans by the Bay Area Business Group on Health to form a health care 
purchasing cooperative are a preview of the type of large buying alliances 
envisioned by President Clinton's health care reform plan. But a growing number 
of businesses across the country are moving ahead of health care reform to form 
health care buying groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department's decision to not challenge the Bay Area group's plan 
"provides impetus for other employers to do the same," said Patricia Powers, 
executive director of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group's members include 19 public and private businesses, such 
as Bank of America, Chevron Corp. and Pacific Gas & Electric. The group plans 
to negotiate directly with health maintenance organizations for coverage for 
employees, dependents and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 The group had asked the Justice Department last fall for a formal opinion on 
whether its health care buying consortium would violate antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1989, the Bay Area group is among a small but growing number of 
employer health care purchasing cooperatives in cities such as 
Minneapolis-St.Paul. Most of the other groups include mostly small or 
medium-size businesses, said Powers, while the Bay Area group includes some of 
the state's biggest employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, its members account for $3 billion in annual health care spending 
and provide coverage for 2.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers said the coalition "is not just trying to beat on the (health) plans 
and say 'Give us a great price.' " The group has also worked to establish 
standard HMO benefits packages, customer satisfaction surveys and guidelines 
for preventing disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The buying consortium would seek bids from HMOs to provide coverage beginning 
in 1995. Not all of the 19 members would participate during the first year. For 
example, the group includes the giant California Public Employees Retirement 
System, which recently completed negotiations for member health coverage for 
its 1995 contract year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the Bay Area group include the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco, McKesson Corp., Mervyn's, Pacific Telesis Group, Safeway Stores and 
Wells Fargo Bank, among others.

 Galoob Wins Video Lawsuit Appeal: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 
that Lewis Galoob Toys is entitled to a $15-million bond posted by Nintendo of 
America after a lower court judge ruled that Galoob's Game Genie video game 
enhancer had not infringed Nintendo's copyright.The $15 million represents 
profits lost to Galoob, based in South San Francisco, because of an injunction 
blocking Galoob for a time from selling Game Genie. A lower court judge had 
ruled that Galoob was wrongfully enjoined from selling the video-game 
attachment. Nintendo said it would appeal the latest ruling.

VEGAS GALA SHAPES UP AS A JACKSON FAMILY GAMBLE; BENEFIT: SLOW TICKET SALES 
FORCE PRICE CUTS, WHILE MICHAEL'S ROLE IN TONIGHT'S SHOW IS MINIMAL. SOME MONEY 
IS EARMARKED FOR CHARITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When announced last summer, NBC's "The Jackson Family Honors" was shaping up 
as a massive charity gala featuring a rare live TV performance by Michael 
Jackson. It was to be staged in Atlantic City in December. 
</P>
<P>
 With the concert finally on tap tonight in Las Vegas, much of the sheen has 
rubbed off: 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite indications as late as last week by executive producer Jermaine 
Jackson that his brother would perform a solo number on the show, Michael's 
press representative announced Wednesday that it won't happen. Michael will 
simply sing one song with the family and present humanitarian awards to 
Elizabeth Taylor and Motown Records founder Berry Gordy. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the same 12,000-seat MGM Grand Hotel arena where Barbra Streisand 
recently sold out two shows in less than an hour, tickets were still remaining 
for the two-hour TV taping as of Friday morning. The slow sales are why prices 
on thousands of mid-level tickets were cut Wednesday from $350 to $150, sources 
said. Other tickets range from $50 to $1,000 for special charity packages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Though the "musical benefit" could garner up to $6 million in TV broadcast 
fees and ticket revenues if the concert sells out, only $500,000 is formally 
pledged to charities not controlled by the Jacksons. The remaining $5.5 million 
would be paid to a Jackson Family nonprofit foundation -- never mentioned in 
the concert's ads -- to cover production costs, including expenses incurred 
when the show had to be moved from Atlantic City to Las Vegas, organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hopes for corporate sponsorships to underwrite the cost of the production 
vanished after Michael Jackson was accused by a 13-year-old boy last August of 
sexual molestation. The corporate sponsorship figure once being bounced around 
in the industry was $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge for me was to just make it happen," said Jermaine Jackson, 
executive producer of the show and president of Jackson Communications Inc., 
the corporation staging the event. "It was a major challenge just to overcome 
all the obstacles. Even now, we're still putting out fires." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC will air the MGM Grand Garden arena show on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The event marks Michael Jackson's first formal stage appearance since cutting 
short a world concert tour in November because of a drug addiction he said 
stemmed partially from dealing with the molestation claims. The entertainer 
denied the allegations, but reportedly paid more than $10 million last month to 
settle a lawsuit filed by the boy. No criminal charges have been lodged against 
the singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's sister Janet and brother Jermaine will perform solo and the Jackson 
5 (minus Michael) are expected to stage a number stocked with 29 Jackson 
relatives, including mom and pop Katherine and Joe Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 LaToya Jackson, who has claimed she and her siblings grew up in an abusive 
household and who publicly has questioned brother Michael's sexual behavior, is 
not expected to attend. Other musical guests scheduled to perform include 
Gladys Knight, Smokey Robinson and Celine Dion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was most important to bring the family together to help the less fortunate 
in the world," Jermaine Jackson said. "The idea behind this whole thing is to 
give back. It's a charitable event. We're not getting paid for this. It's been 
a long process and it's been worth it all." 
</P>
<P>
 The executive producer said "net proceeds" from the event will be donated to 
the Permanent Charities Committee of the Entertainment Industry, a Studio 
City-based 52-year-old fund-raising arm of the show business community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is for Permanent Charities Committee to distribute a maximum $500,000 
donation, mostly for California earthquake relief, to Northridge Medical 
Center, St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, the American Red Cross and the 
Salvation Army, with lesser amounts earmarked for the Friends of Conservation 
and the Library of Congress' American Popular Music Program. 
</P>
<P>
 If the show sells out, concert promoters speculate that the 12,000 tickets 
could generate an estimated $2.5 million. Representatives for the Jacksons said 
the family's firm already has secured an additional $3.5 million in broadcast 
fees from NBC in the United States and 25 other stations around the world. The 
company could generate more revenue if successful in marketing the show to 
other countries after it airs next week. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Jackson camp said that if the show sells out, 
approximately $5.5 million would be paid to Jackson Jubilee Inc., a New 
Jersey-based nonprofit group, to cover the administrative and production costs 
of putting on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for the family said that Jackson Jubilee was incorporated under New 
Jersey law on Nov. 8, 1993, and that applications have been filed for nonprofit 
status. The Internal Revenue Service, the New Jersey Charities Registration 
Office and the California Registry of Charitable Trusts have no record of the 
group on file. 
</P>
<P>
 Undisclosed portions of the $5.5 million will be paid to Jackson 
Communications Inc., a family corporation, and Gary Smith, the Emmy-winning 
producer behind the 200-person, $3-million production, as well as to TWI, a New 
York agency that negotiated the international broadcast fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for the Jacksons said no one in the family will make money on 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The "Jackson Family Honors" was originally scheduled for taping in Atlantic 
City on Dec. 11 to be broadcast as an NBC special on Jan. 10. Corporate 
sponsors that expressed interest last year in financing the project dropped out 
after Michael Jackson disappeared and reportedly checked into a London 
drug-treatment clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is being produced by Jackson Communications Inc. The company, based 
in Iselin, N.J., was formed by Jermaine, his parents and real estate attorney 
Robert Petrallia in 1991 to pursue the possible development of an 
entertainment-oriented urban-renewal project in Asbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, which is reportedly involved in real estate and talent management, 
negotiated a six-year deal last April with NBC to broadcast the award show 
annually, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company was set up to give the (Jackson) family an opportunity to develop 
a dynastic quality very much in the tradition of the Rockefellers and the 
Vanderbilts," said Petrallia, who is JCI's chairman and chief executive 
officer. "But it also has a very big interest in participating in activities 
that improve the quality of life around the world. Virtually every project we 
do has some nonprofit aspect to it." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC officials said that when the licensing agreement was first reached between 
the network and Jackson Communications last summer, the event was designed 
strictly as an entertainment special. It was only after the plans were under 
way that the Jacksons decided to turn the event into a benefit, network 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The network added that it researched the listed charities to verify that they 
were legitimate, but that NBC is not involved in the distribution of the funds 
to those charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Reportedly, the controversy surrounding Michael Jackson and the other members 
of the family has not impaired commercial sales for the TV show. The show was 
nearly sold out as of late last week. Major advertisers such as MCI, 
Volkswagen, General Foods and Procter & Gamble bought time at the rate of 
$130,000 per 30 seconds, which is about average for this kind of programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't ignore the adverse publicity, but this is one of these situations 
that you look at from a client-by-client situation," said Douglas Seay, senior 
vice president of national broadcast for Hal Riney & Associates, a New 
York-based agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay said he was considering buying time on the special for clients: "As a 
package, this show makes for good counter-programming for the Olympics. There's 
an automatic interest factor, not unlike a tawdry soap opera." 
</P>

staff writers John Lippman and James Bates also contributed to this story.

A STREETWISE LATINO BEAMS HIS MESSAGE; RADIO: ON KPCC-FM'S 'SANCHO SHOW,' 
COLLEGE ASSOCIATE DEAN DANIEL CASTRO USES BARRIO VERNACULAR TO URGE HIS 
LISTENERS TO GET AN EDUCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a cold Saturday night at KPCC-FM (89.3), the Pasadena City College radio 
station, a silvery-haired disc jockey sits hunched over a microphone and 
launches into an odd form of rap found nowhere else on the FM dial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here on the airwaves of Aztlan, that's A-Z-T-L-A-N," he says. "You 
don't know what that means? Look it up! Naaah, it ain't in the dictionary, man, 
it's too hip to be in the dictionary. Go to the library and tell 'em Sancho 
sent you, and they'll even let you use the books for free! I know you don't 
believe it, but it's true! Libraries are free! So jog your mind, La Raza, jog 
your mind!" 
</P>
<P>
 The language is calo , the vernacular of the barrio; the music is all Latino 
and the attitude is street. It's Sancho's message that comes as a surprise: Get 
an education and be an asset to La Raza, your Chicano people, or drop out and 
be a loser. Aztlan, the Promised Land of Aztec mythology, is within reach of 
those who educate themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 10 years on KPCC, "The Sancho Show" has become a cult event, boasting 
an estimated 20,000 listeners, dozens of fan clubs across Southern California 
and a die-hard, mainly Eastside following that tunes in to see what madness 
Sancho and his crew -- engineer Mary Martin and associate producer Richard 
(Riche) Barron -- will cook up from 6 to 10 p.m. each week. 
</P>
<P>
 As Martin and Barron scurry to and fro keeping the show on course, Sancho 
riffs on everything from tortillas and "Monie" girls (from Ramona Convent) to 
"Mary's cool car with the tiger-skin seat covers." He fills his patter with 
inside jokes aimed at friends and family. While careless listeners complain 
that the program is a "cholo show" -- run by what sounds like a dropout from 
the barrio -- his fans recognize it as a celebration of Mexican American 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, Sancho is Daniel Castro, Ph.D., associate dean of student 
activities at East Los Angeles College, former prison educator and reformer, 
one-time real estate developer and longtime education crusader. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the top level, we're playing some music and having fun," says Castro, 49, 
who does his disc jockeying for free. "But the bottom line," he says, is that 
"we're here to educate. The day I quit educating people, I'll be gone." 
</P>
<P>
 If he feels like talking calo , he does. "The hook is to get people to laugh, 
and to understand that I have a choice (in how he speaks)," Castro explains. 
For every "Spanglish" street expression he uses, he says, he's sure to 
construct a sentence that makes it clear he's a home boy with an education. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he's hooked listeners, Castro's goal is to build pride in their Mexican 
American heritage and get them to go to school. (Because he is Chicano himself, 
Castro aims the program at other English-speaking Mexican Americans, but other 
Latinos and whites are welcome.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I started listening in April, and it's become a religious observance," says 
Sancho fan Corina Carrasco, 37, who has come by the station to donate to a 
Sancho-sponsored canned-food drive and to look over the Sancho T-shirts and 
memorabilia being sold for scholarship money. "I like the music but, most of 
all, I like Sancho's manner. I like it when he asks people to call and vote on 
songs, or what kind of chicharrones they like. He's a real person." 
</P>
<P>
 The show was created 10 years ago when Castro, then working in real estate, 
and some of his colleagues on the Pasadena Scholarship Committee set out to 
figure out why the dropout rate among Mexican Americans was so high. Along the 
way, the committee found that 70% of the information young Latinos were getting 
was from the radio, so Castro decided that the best way to reach at-risk kids 
was through a radio program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sancho Show" started out as a temporary gig, one hour a week, but it 
gradually lengthened and took hold. Now, as an outgrowth, Castro organizes the 
annual Chicano Music Awards and has just issued a "Best of Sancho" CD, both to 
raise money for scholarships. He sponsors everything from canned food drives 
for fire victims, to a "burrito brigade" to feed earthquake victims, to a Cinco 
de Mayo 5-K run around the Rose Bowl that ends with a feast of menudo, chorizo 
and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro's alter ego, Sancho, was born the first night of the show. Castro and 
his then-partner, Jesse Gomez, Pasadena City College's track coach, had planned 
to talk about a fictional student named Sancho. Ten seconds before they went on 
the air, Castro recalls, "Jesse looks at me and said, 'You know what? There's 
no use in having two nervous people in here,' and got up and walked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro tried playing himself and talking about Sancho, but by the end of the 
show decided it would be easier simply to play the part of Sancho himself. The 
Sancho character is "someone that's in everyone's family," Castro explains, 
"just happy-go-lucky, having a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 The content of the show varies each week. Between tunes from the Pistoleros of 
Merced, Los Rock Angels and Thee Midniters, Castro's 16-year-old daughter, 
Tonantzin, might guest-star, playing the part of Giant Gretchen from the Glow 
Girls Gorgeous Latinas of Wrassling. On other shows, visitors ranging from 
youngsters who want to learn radio to community activists, musicians, authors 
and educators drop in to chat with Sancho about upcoming projects or community 
lore. 
</P>
<P>
 In one on-air bit, Castro jokes about the "Marrano Beach Club," referring to a 
stream near a former pig ranch in what is now the Whittier Narrows Recreation 
Facility, where Mexican American parents -- including his own -- used to take 
their children to play. Reviving the memory of a bygone community hangout is 
"keeping the culture alive," he says. Now, he says, parents take their kids to 
the site to learn about a piece of Mexican American history. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Pasadena, Castro's interest in education took him through 
UC Santa Barbara, Occidental College, a brief stint at USC law school and to 
Union Graduate School, where he earned a doctorate in sociology. He taught 
Chicano studies at the Terminal Island prison, worked for the bureau of prisons 
in Washington and then spent several years in Sacramento writing prison reform 
legislation. He returned to Pasadena and ran unsuccessfully for the state 
Assembly, then worked in real estate development for a while before arriving at 
East L.A. College in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first two years of the (radio) program, no one knew who Sancho was," 
Castro says. But his anonymity eventually withered. Now he's famous enough that 
at East L.A. College, he jokes, "Half the kids call me Sancho, the other half 
call me Dr. Castro."CASTRO, DANIEL (

POP BEAT: OBSCURE -- AND HAPPY; MEDICINE'S MIX IS AMBIGUOUS, ALLURING -- AND 
SANS HYPE. 'WE WANT IT TO BE AN ORGANIC THING, WHERE PEOPLE DISCOVER THE MUSIC 
THEMSELVES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "When I put our CD on, I want to hear something completely confusing," says 
Medicine's guitarist and founder Brad Laner. "I want to be wondering, 'How the 
hell did they do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Laner, 27, singer Beth Thompson, 26, and drummer Jim Goodall, 41, have reached 
that goal. The band's layers of ethereal and abrasive guitar, synthesized 
effects and smooth, liquid vocals are ambiguous and alluring. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the group's second full album, "The Buried Life," reached the Top 20 on 
the college radio airplay charts after its release last October, it has 
remained an underground entity, creeping slowly toward daylight through word of 
mouth from such fans as Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan and Britain's Cocteau 
Twins. The trio's upcoming EP "The Sounds of Medicine," due in May, features a 
remix by Corgan and a song sung by the Cocteaus' Elizabeth Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
 But Medicine, who opens for Swervedriver at the Whisky on Monday and Tuesday, 
is happy in its obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been no massive media hype or MTV blitz, and that's completely 
intentional," saysLaner, who lives in North Hollywood. "We want it to be an 
organic thing, where people discover the music themselves. That way, if we ever 
do get massively popular, it won't be a fluke. Besides, how would you hype a 
band like Medicine?" 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean Laner wants to keep his music a secret. "Sometimes I get 
frustrated because I think the album is packed with hits. . . . Then I listen 
to what hits are out there, and I realize how weird we are." 
</P>
<P>
 The group formed in L.A.'s underground art rock scene, where Laner played 
guitar, electronics and drums for remote groups like Vox Pop, Nervous Gender 
and Savage Republic. Thompson, Goodall, guitarist Jim Putnam and bassist Eddie 
Ruscha completed the first lineup, which recorded the debut album "Shot Forth 
Self Living" for the British label Creation. American Records (then Def 
American) signed the band and re-released the album in 1992. Medicine released 
the EP "5ive" early last year, then reduced itself to a trio. 
</P>
<P>
 Laner grew up in Van Nuys and Sepulveda, where he formed an early obsession 
with music. Between the third and sixth grades, he recorded 40 albums on 
cassette. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made funny noises and songs. I had a piano in my bedroom I slept next to. I 
was just a little music nerd kid. Still am." 
</P>
<P>
 The Beatles were a favorite until he was 10, when he discovered Frank Zappa 
and Captain Beefheart. But it was the radical Yoko Ono albums of the late '60s 
that laid the groundwork for his current sound. "She was like screaming her 
head off over guitar feedback, and that just blew my mind. It set me off making 
guitar feedback at a really early age and driving my parents crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Laner went on to work on 30 independent albums with various obscure bands 
before starting Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've easily made hundreds of albums worth of music," says Laner, who calls 
songwriting something of a compulsion. "I have whole closets full of cassettes. 
The albums that I'm on are only a tiny fraction of the music I've made." 
</P>
<P>
 Medicine's sound is partly a meltdown of his musical past, but "The Buried 
Life" is so fused with other elements, even he has trouble identifying the 
origins. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I like about this album," he says. "I can't put my finger on it 
as easily as the first album. Before, I was real anxious to give the band a 
defining sound, but with this one, I wanted to lessen that and be all over the 
place. If someone says the album's jangly or noisy or poppy, they're not wrong. 
That's just the way they hear it. There's a hundred ways to interpret it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Medicine's music, sadness seems to come out in contemplative lulls, and 
anger in swirling chaos. But Laner insists that it reflects little of his own 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "My problem with confessional music is that it's mundane," he says. "It's 
like, 'Here's my feelings, here's my life.' With us, we're making a different 
life altogether. We're trying to create a separate reality rather than wallow 
in whatever reality we may be in at the time. It's more fun. There's nothing 
wrong with escapism."

O.C. COMEDY REVIEW; IT'S GARRY SHANDLING'S GRAMMY WARM-UP; PERFORMER DELIVERS A 
DISJOINTED ACT IN IRVINE, BUT APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND AS HE 
PREPARES TO HOST AWARDS SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After a three-year absence from performing stand-up in front of alive 
audience, it's understandable that Garry Shandling's rhythm would be a little 
off. But how does he explain his inability to finish a sentence or hold a 
thought, much less weave together a story, which is the comic's general style? 
</P>
<P>
 Running roughshod as he did over stand-up comedy's basic tenets (the same way 
he does on TV), Shandling's personality, disarming smile, banter and material 
kept the show from turning into "A Night of Free Association With Garry 
Shandling." But it came close. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of Thursday night's first show at the Irvine Improv, Shandling, 44, 
would start a story, get sidetracked, chat with the crowd and then head back to 
his original point. Not a classic stand-up performance, but, again, what can be 
reasonably expected of someone working from yellow legal pages on a stool? 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-Shandling crowd didn't seem to mind if he was skirting his potential. 
It was as if the performer had invited about 300 of his closest friends for a 
night of trial and error. He also had two shows scheduled Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brentwood resident, however, was not trying to polish or craft a stand-up 
show. He was merely there to work on new material for the Grammys, which he 
will host for the fourth time, on March 1 on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 But when fans are paying $20 a head, it's reasonable to expect something more 
than a tired-looking man thumbing through his notes.  
</P>
<P>
 The sold-out 60-minute set included a few of Shandling's old chestnuts but 
lacked his famous broken-leg trip to Hawaii and the time he met then-Vice 
President George Bush at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we heard how the music awards will be having a gun-for-Grammys swap. 
Referring to some of the nominees who are in trouble with the law, he said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be a very big night." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's show started off as typical Shandling, king of the fret, except 
this time it wasn't his hair he was fretting over. Apparently the applause died 
down too soon for the star of HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show." If he hadn't 
gotten to the stage as quickly as he did, he lamented, the room would've been 
silent by the time he walked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he turned to a new mural of him on the wall and asked: "Geeez. Do I look 
that troubled?" 
</P>
<P>
 From there, he launched into a routine that jumped from the Winter Olympics to 
the Bobbitts to the Grammys, in no particular order. Bantering with the crowd 
served as his segues. During all this, the Arizona-raised comedian found time 
to floss his teeth and pick up broken glass he had found on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, all the disjointed musings and tangential thinking caught up 
with Shandling. (He even kidded he was too tired to do the second show.) The 
ramblin' man's last 10 minutes fairly dribbled off the stage. He closed with a 
quick joke, thanked the audience and disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, Shandling's previous live stand-up show was also in Irvine, at 
the Barclay Theatre, when he recorded his splendid 1991 HBO special, "Garry 
Shandling: Stand-Up." It's a shame he couldn't find any of that same energy 
Thursday, especially when you consider that vintage Shandling is among the best 
in stand-up.

TALES FROM A ROCKY ROADIE; POP MUSIC: PHIL KAUFMAN, THE GRAM PARSONS CREMATOR 
AND CHARLES MANSON-ALBUM PRODUCER, SIGNS HIS RAUCOUS MEMOIRS IN ANAHEIM TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "It is sort of a unique story, stealing a body and burning it in the desert," 
allows Phil Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
 It's such little career highlights that permit Kaufman, a road manager, to 
have an autobiography out at a time when some of his former star clients don't 
even have active careers. Especially the ones he has torched. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, he only stole and cremated one body, and that was actually a noble, if 
thoroughly drunken, act of friendship toward his departed friend, country/rock 
pioneer Gram Parsons. But that's not the only event that makes "Road Mangler 
Deluxe" (written with Colin White, White/Boucke Publishing, $9.75) a 
rambunctious page-turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman also happened to produce the now-infamous "Lie" album by his onetime 
prison-mate Charles Manson. As one of the persons who defined the job of road 
manager , Kaufman has worked for Parsons, the Rolling Stones, Frank Zappa, Joe 
Cocker, Emmylou Harris and others, becoming an industry legend in the process.  
</P>
<P>
 He'll be sharing some of his road stories during a book-signing at Tower 
Records in Anaheim (220 N. Beach Blvd.) at 1 p.m. today and 11 a.m. Sunday at 
Bookstar in Torrance (2730 Pacific Coast Highway). 
</P>
<P>
 Recently at the Burbank "Tonight Show" studio, Kaufman was at work, though 
you'd scarcely know it by seeing the 58-year-old walrus-mustached, tattooed 
half-biker/half-cherub dancing down the halls, casting one-liners at the unwary 
celebrities and crew in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
 His longtime employer and friend Harris was appearing on the show, and he'd 
already done his work -- "a 100% need-to-know-basis responsibility" -- of 
making sure his client was at the gig and in working order.  
</P>
<P>
 That oftentimes is a major task. In the case of working for legendary imbiber 
Cocker, it meant: 
</P>
<P>
 "Take Joe to work on this shoulder, take Joe home on that shoulder," Kaufman 
recalls. "It was a very distasteful, menial job for me. But once I got Joe to 
work, it was almost worth it when he was onstage." 
</P>
<P>
 His job also entails having the foresight to deal with any contingency, so 
that when everyone was snowed-in once at the Denver airport, Harris and her 
band were among the very few to make it out, arriving at their gig in 
four-wheel drive vehicles he'd rented from a ski resort.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Zappa's band missed a connecting flight, Kaufman scoured up private Lear 
jets to get them to the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he gets the logistics out of the way, the other big part of his job 
pretty much is the dancing and joking part.  
</P>
<P>
 "I kinda like me. I feel better than James Brown," he said, and he seems so at 
home, and relaxedly outrageous, in any situation, that it makes the gigs go 
smoother. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I may be so bold, I've made an art form of this job, in getting along with 
people and taking care of business. I've had guys tell me, "Hey, thanks man, 
you're really nice; most road managers are real asses. Usually, the bigger the 
star, the bigger the attitude of the road manager.' The way I see it, my job is 
not to make it difficult; it's to make it easy for the artists and everybody, 
but keep control. If you can make your point with humor, you don't lose a 
friend doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are those Kaufman doesn't especially care if he's friends 
with. He's extremely protective of his artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody's rude to Emmylou, he's gonna really hear it from me. In London 
once, this guy came up to Emmylou backstage at the Wembley Arena, and he 
grabbed me and said 'I got an artist here; she's better than Emmylou; she can 
sing better. . . . Emmylou's gonna be eatin' her shorts.' I said 'Excuse me, 
could you come with me for a second?' I walked him to the door and decked him." 
</P>
<P>
 He took a similar approach on an airliner once. 
</P>
<P>
 "The band's crew was having a food fight, really rowdy. The stewardess came up 
said to me, 'Look, I am gonna have them arrested at the airport unless you do 
something.' So I went up to the biggest guy in the crew, said 'stand up,' and 
(expletive) hit him right in the mouth, sat him down and said, "Now you 
(expletive) sit there and don't get out of that seat until we get to the 
airport." Boy that made it quiet in the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, something like that could have reflected poorly on Emmy. I don't think 
I'm as paternalistic toward my artists as I am pal-istic. I'm their pal. I'm 
not exactly a fatherly image, but if I can help them with something, I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Harris: "I keep hiring Phil because he's the one who remembers all the 
funny anecdotes so I can tell them on the 'Tonight Show.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Their friendship stretches back over two decades to when she was a backup 
singer with Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman has his job wired pretty tight, considering that when Parsons first 
asked him to become a road manager, Kaufman's response was, "What's that?" 
</P>
<P>
 He learned it was simply a mobile version of what he'd already been doing for 
the Rolling Stones while they were in Los Angeles finishing up their "Beggar's 
Banquet" album. Kaufman, fresh out of prison and a self-proclaimed "jazz 
bigot," had never heard of the Stones when a friend lined him up for a job as 
their "executive nanny," as Mick Jagger came to call him.  
</P>
<P>
 When he came home from his first day on the job with a handful of cash and the 
keys to a Cadillac, his girlfriend of the time hit the roof, thinking he'd 
stolen them. "No, it's this thing called rock 'n' roll. They give you money and 
cars." He got to like the life -- and the music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He attributes the confidence he brings to his job to his prison experience, 
which resulted from a botched marijuana-smuggling attempt in the early '60s.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something I want to do again; I don't recommend it as a panacea for 
people with inferiority complexes, but prison gave me a real insight into life. 
It really woke me up. I came out a better person, not because of the penal 
system, but because I decided I wasn't going to let it be a negative 
experience. I actually had some good times in prison." 
</P>
<P>
 And, while there, he made contacts with influential people.  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, some of the finest murderers I know are in prison," he said. When he met 
Charles Manson at Terminal Island in the mid '60s, Manson was a skinny would-be 
musician who Kaufman said sang like Frankie Laine and hung around his "family." 
He wasn't impressed by Manson's rap, but he did like the family's free way with 
sex. Later, when the family was arrested, "I realized I'd had sex with every 
one of those murderesses," he recounts in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 He had already fallen out with Manson before the murders and indeed says he 
may have been one of the intended targets of the La Bianca murders. Until all 
the evidence against Manson came out in the trial, Kaufman hadn't thought the 
"take acid, make love" Mansonites could be capable of such crimes.  
</P>
<P>
 With that belief, and seeing money to be made, in 1971 he released the "Lie" 
album, made from sessions he had previously produced of Manson's music. Though 
quite a collector's item now (and with a song off it recently covered by Guns 
'N Roses), it didn't zoom up the hit parade then.  
</P>
<P>
 "Still, prior to the convictions, I went up to Telegraph Road in Berkeley, the 
most radical place in the world in the '60s, but not one shop would touch that 
record. Granted, it was a real piece of trash. But it's a great interest 
generator, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman claims Manson had signed the rights to the songs over to him, and he's 
having a lawyer look into collecting royalties on Axl Rose's version of "Look 
at Your Game Girl." He doesn't feel any guilt in trying to profit from the 
Manson connection, figuring it's due recompense for having his life threatened 
by family members. And that Rose-covered tune was the song Manson used to 
entice females into the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He meant 'Look at your game, girl,' like 'See the the head game you're 
playing, when you could be free and be with me.' I'd listen to him sing it to 
these new girls, and it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman's most noted participation in rock history came in 1973 when he and a 
friend used a borrowed hearse to steal his friend Parson's body from LAX and 
drive it out to Joshua Tree to cremate it. Parsons had been estranged from his 
wealthy Southern family, and he had a pact with Kaufman that if he died, the 
body would go to his beloved Joshua Tree, not the family plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman's recounting of that tale is moving, hilariously irreverent and too 
involved to detail here, making it a good thing it's all in his book. The 
outcome is that Parsons' charred molecules are now part of the desert scenery, 
and Kaufman was tried and compelled to reimburse a mortuary for the cost of the 
casket. 
</P>
<P>
 While burning corpses can give one a bit of a reputation, Kaufman says it 
hasn't given him a stigma to live down.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people in this business were fans of Gram's. So when they talk to 
me, it isn't 'I heard you stole somebody's body.' They know the story." 
</P>
<P>
 His greatest credibility comes, he says, from working for Harris.  
</P>
<P>
 "Emmylou gives me credibility. When somebody as respectable as Emmylou 
continually asks for me to work for her, it means I must be doing something 
right. I feel very honored to work for her." 
</P>
<P>
 He's not over-enamored of the changes that have taken place in the music 
business since he's been in it, even if its business-like manner makes his job 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, you'd have situations like, (he assumed a mellow hippie 
voice) 'My old lady will make the meals man, and we've got a van; we'll pick 
you up in and take you to your tents .' That's gone now. Years ago small 
entrepreneurs were the promoters. Now it's big promoters. They have gotten more 
callous, too, more corporate, more business. In older days they were fun 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've even changed the title of what I do. Now it's a tour manager. The 
difference between a road manager and a tour manager, the way I see it, is a 
tour manager has Hal Burton briefcases, pagers, at least one cellular phone, an 
incredibly (expletive) attitude, and they are more important than the artists. 
The road manager is the opposite: He takes care of business. I am definitely a 
road manager." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's been considering getting into the more lucrative field of artist 
management.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been entertaining that thought, that or take all the money from this 
book and go buy a Volkswagen camper and (go) off somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he met co-author White, and began dictating his stories into a 
cassette recorder. When the publication of "Road Mangler Deluxe" was feted at 
Brown's Diner in Nashville, Tenn., a few months back, more than 400 friends and 
celebrities showed up. After decades of working behind the scenes for others, 
Kaufman says he doesn't feel odd to have the spotlight on him now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been a celebrity, in my own mind. I'm just getting more coverage 
now."

 Now that it is official that Glenn Close, not Patti LuPone, will be Broadway's 
first Norma Desmond in "Sunset Boulevard," a new guessing game can begin: Who 
will be L.A.'s second Norma Desmond? 
</P>

 After numerous rumors and months of speculation, a spokesman for "Sunset" 
confirmed on Friday that Close will leave L.A.'s "Sunset Boulevard" when her 
contract expires on June 26. According to the current schedule, she won't open 
at the Minskoff Theater in New York until Nov. 17. A new Norma will have to be 
in place here long before Close opens there. 
</P>
<P>
 John Barlow, a New York-based spokesman for the L.A. production said Friday 
that no one has yet been picked to replace Close but added that we should know 
"shortly. They are now going through the Norma search." Barlow said they are 
looking for "a star." 
</P>
<P>
 The role is "the part of a lifetime. You'd eat somebody's laundry for a year 
to get that part," Meryl Streep recently told Entertainment Weekly. However, a 
spokeswoman for Streep said the actress herself is "not a possibility at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 An unconfirmed report by columnist Liz Smith on Wednesday that Close got the 
New York gig so upset LuPone that she missed three performances in the role in 
London on Wednesday and Thursday, said LuPone spokesman Robert Garlock. 
However, Garlock said she went on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Because LuPone's London contract stipulated that she also would play the role 
in New York, she is likely to receive a hefty sum as a buyout. Garlock said she 
would demand compensation "in the millions." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's disappointed she's not in the show, but she's also disappointed by the 
way she was treated," said Garlock, who added that the diva was informed of 
Close's casting only one hour prior to curtain time on Wednesday -- and it was 
her agent, who had read about it in the papers, who told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Garlock cited several other disagreements between LuPone and the show's 
producer-composer Andrew Lloyd Webber: She was not given approval over who 
would replace her co-star Kevin Anderson in London, as Garlock said she had 
been promised; she was not allowed to sing two songs from the show at the 
Westwood Playhouse in January, 1993, and only later was told that it was 
because Barbra Streisand was recording the same songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The stream of rumors that she might be replaced were upsetting, said Garlock. 
Some of these were fed by Lloyd Webber himself. For example, in a magazine 
article in The Times last month, Lloyd Webber was quoted saying that Close "is 
a joy and fun to work with. Which I must say is a change from, shall we say, 
another Norma we've had." In the same article, Lloyd Webber added that LuPone 
is "a superb performer. But what she must do is to understand not to be 
threatened. Patti just needs to relax a bit. That's all. And not worry." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Lloyd Webber could not be reached by press time. 
</P>
<P>
 Garlock said LuPone was approached by the producers of the new Stephen 
Sondheim/James Lapine musical, "Passion," but didn't consider the request 
because it would have required her to break her "Sunset" contract. A spokesman 
for "Passion" confirmed the show's casting agents had investigated LuPone's 
availability last fall, before a workshop production was held, but were told 
that she was unavailable. Donna Murphy has had the role since then.

 It's a Wrap: Veteran KNBC Entertainment Reporter David Sheehan is leaving the 
station and may wind up soon at his former station, rival KCBS-TV. In a 
statement released by KNBC, officials said that Sheehan "has informed us that 
he has had a great career at KNBC-TV and has accomplished the goals that he set 
for himself nine years ago when he joined the station. He has decided to pursue 
other career opportunities and looks forward to new challenges." Sheehan is the 
latest in a series of anchors and reporters to leave KNBC in recent months. 
KCBS-TV General Manager Bill Applegate said Friday that he had talked with 
Sheehan about joining the "Action News" team but that no formal negotiations 
had taken place. However, Applegate added, "If you were going to make a bet on 
David winding up here, it would be a good bet."

 * Indecency Reprieve?: A federal appeals court in Washington has agreed to 
take another look at government regulations banning indecent programming on 
broadcast and cable TV. The rules were thrown out in November after a 
three-judge panel held them to be unconstitutional. But now the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit says it will reconsider that 
decision. At issue are FCC regulations that had barred indecent TV and radio 
broadcasts between 6 a.m. and midnight and that had allowed cable-TV operators 
to ban what they deemed indecent programming from leased-access channels.

 Comic Sick: Bill Hicks, one of the more bracing figures on the comedy club 
circuit, is reported to be "very ill" with pancreatic cancer and resting at his 
parents' home in Little Rock, Ark. His condition was announced in a written 
statement issued Friday by his management company, which would not comment 
further on how long he has been ill or on prospects for his recovery. A 
longtime cult favorite in England for his dark and biting comic view, Hicks, 
32, has been building a sizable U.S. following in the last two years. In 
October, a comic routine he had taped for David Letterman's "Late Show" was 
completely excised after it was deemed too controversial. STAGE

 The Cold Shoulder: "Unfinished Stories," the Sybille Pearson play that Gordon 
Davidson staged at the Mark Taper Forum in 1992 has opened Off-Broadway to 
discouraging reviews. "It ultimately boils down to a small, whining play about 
some disagreeable people who can't get along," wrote David Richards in the New 
York Times. Jan Stuart of Newsday found it "curiously stillborn" and said 
Davidson's "shockingly reverential direction . . . weighs and sifts through 
every last word as if he were panning for gold." Clive Barnes of the Post found 
Davidson's work "sterling," but "the play rang false." "The title describes the 
work itself," wrote Howard Kissel of the Daily News.

 * Pacino Gets His Own Theater: It won't be called the Al Pacino Theater, but 
the actor is getting his own pocket-size theater on lower Broadway to try out 
new material, including plays and readings for proposed movies. "Al's always 
wanted his own theater . . . and now he's got it," said Michael Hadge, a New 
York stage director and Pacino's partner in his production company, Chal 
Productions. "This is for Al to try out material he's already interested in," 
Hadge said, noting that the location was being kept secret for the moment to 
preserve Pacino's privacy. POP/ROCK

Luther Campbell said police had threatened to arrest them and the audience if 
they performed their usual act. "We don't want you all to go to jail," he said. 
"We don't want anybody to get hit in the head." The group left after about 10 
minutes when some fans began climbing on stage. Four years ago, Cincinnati 
record stores stopped selling the group's album "Nasty as They Wanna Be" after 
the Hamilton County sheriff threatened obscenity charges. QUICK TAKES

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; GOING BY THE GOOD BOOK; MICHAEL W. SMITH, KING OF CHRISTIAN 
POP, GETS BACK TO SOME ATTRACTIVE BASICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his Father's house there are many mansions, and Michael W. Smith has made a 
good move by deciding to play in some of the smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading man in Christian pop, Smith has risen in the past few years to 
arena-headlining stature. He doesn't do those bigger mansions modestly, either. 
Smith's 1991 show at the Bren Events Center in Irvine came complete with 
dazzling lighting effects, while the music replicated the slick, commercial 
sound of his albums, full of chiming synthesizers, swooping electric guitars 
and the occasional machine-driven pop-R&B dance beat. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving even higher on the ladder last year, when he played at the Forum 
in Inglewood, Smith has decided to at least temporarily leave the trappings of 
arena grandeur in storage. A six-week trek dubbed "The Acoustic Tour" skips the 
arenas and brings him to college auditoriums and major churches -- including 
his visit Thursday night to the Vineyard Christian Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3,200 seats, the sold-out sanctuary was the perfect-size hall for a pop 
show: big enough to have the buzz of excitement that comes from being in a 
crowd, and small enough to allow a performer to make an intimate connection 
with everyone in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith spoke gospel when he paused midway through the two-hour show to comment 
on the difference between playing the big mansions and the little ones: In an 
elaborately staged arena concert, he said, "You've gotta go by the book or you 
mess the show up. Here, I can do what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 That involved taking many trips back to the early stages of his decade-long 
recording career, and stripping down his glitzy studio sound to far more 
attractive basics. There is something sweet about a real piano playing off a 
real Hammond B3 organ -- the combination that dominated many of the songs 
(actually, Smith's piano was digital rather than acoustic, but he only once 
programmed it to issue the tinkly-chime instant-schmaltz keyboard tone that 
sugars a lot of his recorded work). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The West Virginia-raised, Nashville-based singer mixed styles well. He and his 
five-man band offered glistening heartland rock a la Bruce Hornsby, the 
polished folk-pop that we're accustomed to hearing from the likes of Shawn 
Colvin and Mary-Chapin Carpenter, and even a harmonically elaborate number, 
"Providence," that recalled Genesis at its most radio-ready. One song flowed 
with a tense Latin current, and another borrowed a reggae rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 These well-crafted surroundings, adorned by a rich, four-part harmony support, 
were enough to compensate for some of the least-commanding singing you'll hear 
from a substantial pop star. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's greatest natural gift is his film-idol looks (he jokingly played to 
the sex symbol image a wee bit during the romantic ballad, "Cross My Heart," by 
tossing in a semi-seductive, Barry White-style aside. "I couldn't resist," he 
said, in wry acknowledgment of the moment's naughtiness). But if the face is 
that of Don Johnson, the voice is more Woody Allen -- scratchy, wispy, and 
pinched, with almost no body or heft. At least Smith's singing is tunefully 
elastic, and he provides himself with flavorful melodies as if they were his 
birthright. Given harmony support that could be Beach Boys lovely one moment 
("I Will Be Here For You") and chain-gang urgent the next ("Nothin' but the 
Blood of Jesus"), he got by with a lot of help from his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's songs are not daring: The aim is to comfort and reaffirm rather than 
to challenge and disturb. There's nothing prickly in his faith as there is with 
that wrathful rock Jeremiah, Bob Dylan (it's a pity that Christian popsters 
don't draw regularly from Dylan, who is this era's greatest and most prolific 
writer of songs-as-prayer and songs-as-prophecy). Nor do you get the mystical 
transports of ecstasy that sweep up Van Morrison in his utterly idiosyncratic 
Christian odes. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Smith avoids adventurous extremes, at least he doesn't deal in fluff. 
</P>
<P>
 Platitudes did crop up in songs like "Give It Away" and "Love One Another," 
but they were less the gist of the set than extra goodies for the fans -- 
rousing, feel-good workouts for listeners who were more than willing to sing 
along, and impressively able to stay in tune while doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith devoted the first third of his show to songs that posed conflicts and 
acknowledged a world of trouble -- including back-to-back ballads in which he 
tried to sort through the shock and pain of a close friend's death. That 
segment ended, in "Leesha," with the inevitable appeal to Christian belief as a 
triumph over death. Still, Smith's plaintive delivery underscored how hard it 
is to live with grief even when one has recourse to the comforts of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith used a long solo segment to reach out to the audience with chatter that 
blended humor and sincerity and showed a nice, personal touch -- something that 
was missing from his Bren Center show in '91. But the solo turn became part of 
an overlong sequence of ballads that had some restless youths in the house 
yelling for more rockin' stuff. Eventually, Smith and band obliged with tougher 
songs such as "Nothin' but the Blood of Jesus" and "Secret Ambition." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has followed the career pattern of his former employer and frequent 
songwriting partner, Amy Grant, in downplaying overtly religious imagery on 
recent albums that have brought him crossover success. But he finished the show 
with some well-received hymns and prayers, indicating he isn't about to forget 
that there is a cross in crossover.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; A BREAK IN THE MIGHTY CLOUDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anybody had the inside track on musical inspiration, you'd think it would 
be a gospel quartet. That goes double for one as noteworthy as the Mighty 
Clouds of Joy. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a performance Thursday that followed mighty clouds of rain across the 
Southland, the veteran quartet sang too often like modest patches of niceness.  
</P>
<P>
 A competent gospel group will elicit nods and murmurs of approval from the 
faithful, which the Grammy Award-winning foursome did several times through the 
90-minute show to a less than capacity audience at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
But a great group in peak form will turn even the biggest skeptics around -- or 
at least get them looking around seriously for the gate where the train to 
glory departs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clouds approached that level of fervor just twice, both in the show's 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was an extended workout on "Heavy Load," in which founding lead 
singer Joe Ligon did some extemporized preaching over a vamped verse. That's 
the Gospel 101 way to build intensity from a whisper to a scream, and Ligon 
seemed, unlike most of the night, to push himself to higher and higher vocal 
heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The other transcendent moment came, ironically, during a show-closing 
rendition of "Shout," the Isley Brothers' secularized R&B version of a old-time 
gospel roof-raiser. The Irvine Barclay's roof stayed securely in place, but at 
least the seats rattled a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 And when a woman took Ligon up on his invitation for audience members to join 
them on stage and do "the Holy Ghost shout," she brought a spontaneity and 
genuine spark to the show that had been largely missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Several elements conspired against the quartet musically breaking free of this 
mortal coil. While the Irvine Barclay is a lovely venue for many types of 
performance, the air-conditioned comfort of a sit-down theater works against 
listeners from taking a more active role in the show. There's nothing like a 
cheap plastic fold-up chair in a sweltering tent on a muggy Sunday morning to 
get folks up and testifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the Clouds' four-man backing band played as lifelessly as a Las 
Vegas show band in the third year of a five-year contract. Guitarist Little 
Joey Williams and keyboardist Alphonso McClain, in particular, looked for all 
the world as though they were toiling away stitching tongues into running 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 They provided little of the dynamic shading and lean-but-solid support that 
marks the best gospel backing bands. The lounge-bar-in-space piano sound 
McClain selected on his synthesizer didn't help.  
</P>
<P>
 The music also suffered from an unflattering sound mix in which the 
instrumentalists often overwhelmed the vocalists. If the striations from 
soprano to bass cannot be distinguished, a gospel quartet is damned.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if the Mighty Clouds don't still possess the raw materials for 
something better. Ligon's gruff roar provides the perfect counterpoint and 
dramatic tension against the silky high harmonies of the other Clouds: Richard 
Wallace, Wilbert Williams and Michael McCowin. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, flashes of brilliance shone through now and then, as with 
Williams' stratospheric solo, reminiscent of Phillip Bailey, in "Walk Around 
Heaven All Day." 
</P>
<P>
 What is so special about such gospel forbears as the Sensational Nightingales 
and contemporaries like the Five Blind Boys of Alabama or the Zion Harmonizers 
is how they can make every performance, even every song, a convincing 
expression of the divine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clouds, by comparison, were all too earthbound. For one who's made a 
career out of focusing his audience's attention on the kingdom of heaven, Ligon 
spent an inordinate amount of time addressing such earthly concerns as their 
souvenir CDs, tapes and photos on sale in the lobby and extending warnings 
against unauthorized videotaping of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Making this substandard performance even more disappointing are how rare it is 
that an ensemble of the stature of the Mighty Clouds visits Orange County and 
what a good year it's been for male traditional gospel groups: The Blind Boys 
and the Fairfield Four both released albums for major labels in 1993, and the 
Mighty Clouds spent a high-profile month last fall appearing with Paul Simon at 
New York's Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, nobody said gospel groups are perfect. After the inevitable off 
night, perhaps they just need to be forgiven.

COMEDY REVIEW; A RAMBLING SHANDLING TESTS GRAMMY JOKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a three-year absence from performing stand-up in front of a live 
audience, it's understandable that Garry Shandling's rhythm would be a little 
off. But how does he explain his inability to finish a sentence or hold a 
thought, much less weave together a story, which is the comic's general style?  
</P>
<P>
 Running roughshod as he did over stand-up comedy's basic tenets (the same way 
he does on TV), Shandling's personality, disarming smile, material and banter 
kept the show from turning into "A Night of Free Association With Garry 
Shandling." But he came close. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of Thursday night's show (the first of four at the Irvine Improv), 
Shandling, 44, would start a story, get sidetracked, chat with the crowd and 
then head back to his original point. Not a classic stand-up performance but, 
again, what can be reasonably expected of someone working from yellow legal 
pages on a stool? 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-Shandling crowd didn't seem to mind if he was skirting his potential. 
It was as if the performer had invited about 300 of his closest friends for a 
night of trial and error. 
</P>
<P>
 Shandling, however, was not trying to polish or craft a stand-up show. He was 
merely there to work on new material for the Grammys, which he will host for 
the fourth time, on March 1 on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 But when fans are paying $20 a head, it's reasonable to expect something more 
than a tired-looking man thumbing through his notes. The 60-minute set included 
a few of Shandling's old chestnuts, but lacked his famous broken-leg trip to 
Hawaii and the time he met then Vice President George Bush at the White House.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we heard how the music awards will be having a gun-for-Grammys swap. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to some of the nominees who are in trouble with the law, he said: "I 
think it's going to be a very big night." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's show started off as typical Shandling, king of the fret, except 
this time it wasn't his hair he was fretting over. Apparently the applause died 
down too soon for the star of HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show." If he hadn't 
gotten to the stage as quickly as he did, he lamented, the room would've been 
silent by the time he walked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he turned to a new mural of him on the wall and asked: "Geez. Do I look 
that troubled?" 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, all the disjointed musings and tangential thinking caught up 
with Shandling. The ramblin' man's last 10 minutes fairly dribbled off the 
stage. He closed with a quick joke, thanked the audience and disappeared.

WRITING FOR CREDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Grazer's stunningly arrogant comment regarding "roundtable" 
screenwriting -- "If a script is good, what does it matter how many people 
wrote it?" -- is typical of the contempt in which Hollywood studio types hold 
writers, brought about by the long and continuing ineffectiveness of the 
Writers Guild of America West ("Roundtable Writing: A Headache for Guild," Feb. 
9). 
</P>
<P>
 Right, Brian.What does it matter who wrote "The Three Sisters"? Or "The Glass 
Menagerie"? Or "All About Eve"? 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to humbly suggest that you "roundtable" the producers and 
directors of your next movie. And I further suggest, since it doesn't matter 
who gets credit for what in films, that you restrict your credit to one among a 
dozen or so others (who probably had more to do with the actual making of the 
movie than you) in a credit roll at the end of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 See how much you like that roundtable.

THE POWER IN 'OLEANNA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Shirley is right to be concerned that "Oleanna" doesn't reflect the 
reality of sexual harassment ("Casting's Just One Bug in 'Oleanna,' " Feb. 7). 
However, "Oleanna" is not a play about sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 As a UCLA associate dean of students who works with those affected by sexual 
harassment and whose area of academic expertise is gender issues, I am uneasy 
with anyone thinking that the interchange David Mamet sets up in the first act 
bears any realistic relation to the sexual harassment some experience. In fact, 
the behavior trivializes the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of "Oleanna" is its ability to incite -- "My job is to make you mad 
. . . ," says John. As a vehicle for forcing us to rethink power and 
perception, the play is an achievement. 
</P>

<P>
 "Oleanna" neither extols nor vilifies political correctness; instead, it is 
about the debate itself. Each side is hopelessly inarticulate, and neither side 
makes the effort required to understand the other's point of view. Unable to 
reason together, teacher and student, man and woman, are reduced to a struggle 
over power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oleanna" is a deliberately ambiguous play. This frustrates those whose 
ideological blinders prevent them from seeing the ambiguity, but it rewards 
those who think about it.

 Don Shirley, I salute you! You finally and exquisitely demythologized 
"Oleanna." Your "rigged as a play can get" puts it bluntly and succinctly. I 
could never understand the awe in which this play has been held. As you say, 
"It has only one thing going for it: timeliness." And that's not enough to 
cause all the furor. The Mark Taper Forum should have disliked the play for 
reasons other than casting and should have had the guts to say so.

IT'S CASTING DIRECTOR  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times continues to call casting directors casting agents ("South Carolina 
High School Teacher Wins Miss USA Contest," Section A, Feb. 12). There is no 
such thing as a casting agent.Casting directors do not represent actors, and we 
do not receive commissions (as do talent agents). Casting directors are hired 
by producers and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 And one more issue: In the review, " 'Twogether': Uncommonly Reflective Love 
Story" (Calendar, Feb. 11), which I cast, the film is given a wonderful review 
and the casting is mentioned, yet in the crew list costume design and sound 
editing are mentioned but no casting credit is given. Why does The Times 
continue to neglect credit for casting directors?

THEATER REVIEW; CLASSIC 'ANNE' COMES TO LIFE AT WILSHIRE THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Great American Children's Theatre of Wisconsin is in town again for a 
10-day stop at its home away from home, the Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills, 
with a capable and often captivating production about a spunky, red-headed 
orphan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Annie"? Nope, it's the 1908 L.M. Montgomery classic "Anne of Green Gables." 
</P>
<P>
 Staged in period costume, on a large, raked set of muted greens and browns 
resembling a page from a pop-up storybook, this favorite tale about the 
spirited orphan of Prince Edward Island who changes the lives of everyone she 
meets is not for girls only. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent performance, boys were chuckling, too, at Anne Shirley's comic 
misadventures on her bumpy road to young adulthood -- dying her hated red hair 
green, intoxicating her best friend by mistake, breaking her slate over the 
head of a young tormentor, coming to grief over her temper. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while Joanna Blythe's adaptation accents the fun, it offers some 
substance as well, allowing the audience to feel Anne's growing pains and the 
close bond that develops between her and her at first reluctant, adoptive 
guardians -- Marilla (Ellen Lochhead and Matthew (Paul Bentzen). 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Leslie Reidel, the cast (all adults) does a respectable job in 
dual roles -- Candace Taylor and Patrick Lawlor, in particular, are appealing 
as Anne's best friend Diana and as her would-be beau Gilbert, respectively, 
while Carol Zippel is properly snooty as disapproving Rachel Lynde. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Julie Jones' thoroughly enjoyable performance in the title role, 
however, that makes this "Anne" more than just a pleasant introduction to a 
classic. With effervescent charm, Jones captures the essence of the young girl 
whose irrepressible enthusiasm for life and discovery both bemuses and enchants 
those around her. 
</P>
<P>
 Composer Adam Guettel accompanies the action with a light touch; Linda Black 
designed the attractive period costumes and Gary Baehler's lighting is clean 
and effective. 
</P>
<P>

Hills, todayand next Saturday, 1 and 3 p.m.; Tue.-Fri., 10 a.m. and noon; Sun.,

MUSIC REVIEW; PASSION FROM TALLIS SCHOLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dedicated to early music repertoire since its founding in 1978, the Tallis 
Scholars are no newcomers to the recently popularized realm of centuries-old 
music. Their central role in the movement -- not to mention their commanding 
musical presence -- lured a full house to Ambassador Auditorium on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program devoted almost entirely to vocal music of the 16th Century, the 
Tallis Scholars performance impressed mightily with engaging musicality, an ear 
for authenticity and scholarly interest. Led with a decisive hand by founding 
director Peter Phillips, the dozen-voice Tallis Scholars persuasively conveyed 
the unique and mesmerizing beauty of Renaissance polyphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Purity of tone and a seamless blend are hallmarks of the group, which gives 
proper weight and articulation to the hypnotic weave of the material. 
</P>
<P>
 Programmatically, the concert's first half was of a piece, between Nicolas 
Gombert's "Ego sum qui sum" and Phillippe Rogier's more extended and elaborate 
mass based on the Gombert piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Renaissance titan Orlando de Lassus' "Prophetiae Sibyllarum" opened the second 
half with its beguiling harmonic restlessness, in contrast to the timeless 
languor of the composer's "Lamentations III (for Maundy Thursday)," which was 
also performed. Closing on a note of enigmatic simplicity, Allegri's "Miserere" 
requires a split group, with singers answering the stage-center group with 
unearthly tones from the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 It all added up to a profound and transporting evening of music, courtesy of 
church musicians of 400 years hence, passionately purveyed by this ensemble. 
Testament to the appeal of early music, the music was of heaven and earth, then 
and now.

THEATER REVIEW; 'ABIGAIL'S' OFFERS A GLIMPSE OF LEIGH'S EARLY EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Leigh's controversial film "Naked," about an angry young man on a 
self-destructive odyssey in London, isn't typical of the British artist's body 
of work. Leigh is usually more bittersweet while ironically depicting 
working-class relationships, as in the cult movie "Life Is Sweet" and his early 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fountainhead Theatre Company has mounted an ambitious, timely example of a 
Leigh stage experiment, "Abigail's Party." Although the production ultimately 
is unsatisfying, the 1977 comedy offers valuable perspective on the provocative 
filmmaker's technique. It is not generally known in the United States that 
Leigh's quasi-documentary, collaborative style emerged from his formative years 
in British theater. As Leigh prominently notes in the published script: " 
'Abigail's Party' was evolved from scratch entirely by rehearsal through 
improvisation." A similar approach created "Naked." 
</P>
<P>
 However, this improvisational style poses a major challenge for director Dane 
Holweger. How do you interpret such idiosyncratic material? Is it character? Or 
is it caricature? 
</P>
<P>
 On the page, "Abigail's Party" reads almost like absurdist satire by Edward 
Albee. In a suburban London living room, cocktails are consumed while mundane 
cliches are tediously recited. 
</P>
<P>
 We can either laugh at such characters, or we can feel sorrow and pity. 
Holweger tries to make "Abigail's Party" a party. Leigh, it would seem, would 
be more likely to maintain a respectful, objective eye. Holweger looks down on 
the two major characters without respect, trivializing them, so that when 
something serious does happen, we don't know what to make of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh's style of improvisation is but a distant cousin to Los Angeles comedy 
club sketches. It's rooted in genuine pathos, hard-earned experience and 
blue-collar desperation. It's naked. By contrast, the Fountainhead's version 
seems fashionably dressed in stand-up shtick. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Abigail's Party," Fountainhead Theatre, 1110 N. Hudson Ave., Hollywood. 
Thursday-Saturday, 8 p.m. Ends March 3. $10-$12.50. (213) 466-1767. Running

ART REVIEW; TAKING A JOURNEY INTO 'DESERT DREAMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite endemic denial, the Southland does have a real history. It's not 
always a pretty picture, but one of its happier images involved artist Maynard 
Dixon. His rarely seen paintings and graphics are on view at the Palm Springs 
Desert Museum. The traveling exhibition's title, "Desert Dreams -- The Art of 
Maynard Dixon," comes from a new biography of the artist by UC Davis scholar 
Donald J. Hagerty, who organized the 70-work show for the Museum of Fine Arts, 
Museum of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist was born in Fresno and lived an itinerant life in the Southwest 
until he died at 71 in 1946. Essentially a rail-thin, elegant self-taught 
loner, he was encouraged by cowboy artist Frederick Remington and gained an 
early reputation in the Bay Area as a popular illustrator of stories by 
everybody from Jack London to O. Henry and Clarence Mulford -- of Hopalong 
Cassidy fame. Evidently Dixon's early work had some of the fictional, 
nostalgic, kiss-the-horse flavor of Hopalong's adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one account it was Dixon's L.A.-aesthetic connection that helped 
him decide to get serious. He met Charles Fletcher Lummis, one of Lotus Land's 
original, self-invented, flamboyant entrepreneurs. Lummis championed 
preservation of both the Southland's Latino and Native American legacies. He 
founded the Southwest Museum. His own house, El Alisal, for which Dixon did the 
decorative metal work, remains a local landmark. The house's sculpture was 
executed by John Gutzon Borglum, an artist cradled in Pasadena's 
crafts-oriented Arroyo movement. Borglum, of course, went on to carve the 
World's Largest Sculpture, that lovable mountain of kitsch, Mt. Rushmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Lummis introduced Dixon to the desert and the artist was hooked. He spent the 
rest of his days painting the Southwestern landscape and its original 
inhabitants, whom he revered as living in older and wiser ways. Native American 
philosophy may have inspired Dixon's own motto, "So live that you can look 
every damn man in the eye and tell him to go to hell." 
</P>
<P>
 So far everything about Dixon's life marks him as the period piece that 
current fashion would clearly hold him to be if it thought about him at all. 
But there is another clue. Besides Lummis, Dixon's other major support and 
inspiration was his second wife, Dorothea Lange. This great WPA photographer of 
the Dust Bowl is a decidedly modernist figure. So what was she doing married to 
a Brontosaurus? The likely conclusion is born out by the evidence of the work. 
Dixon was no dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a representational artist, he regularly spoke out in defense of 
abstract art that clearly molded the clean, dynamic composition of his own 
work. Going through the show, one picks up whiffs of everything from Art 
Nouveau to Cubism, from Regionalism to Metaphysical Surrealism. Dixon 
spontaneously employed the aesthetic recipe that has produced the best art in 
this part of the world from John McLaughlin to Ed Kienholz and Richard 
Diebenkorn. He was a synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are things about this art that put off contemporary viewers, that may 
tell us more about the eyes than the art. The dryness of Dixon's surfaces can 
be a real distraction. Nobody wants a world where even the clouds are made of 
adobe. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of Dixon's habit of seeing the desert landscape as sublime, its 
cowboys and Native Americans as stalwart and heroic? If that makes him appear 
sentimental today, it speaks worse of our cynicism than his idealism. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fun to go through the show imagining which of Dixon's fellow artists 
might like particular pieces, finding a bit of themselves in it. Marsden 
Hartley certainly would have responded to the crackling, symbolic sky of "Mesas 
in Shadow." The way "Moonlight Over Zion" hovers on the border of magic and 
abstraction would have gotten the attention of Georgia O'Keeffe. A quality of 
gently humorous poetry in the purple clouds descending over an adobe in "Late 
Afternoon" somehow sends a message to Ed Ruscha, and there is a smart, 
sonorously decorative screen that would take the attention of Billy Al 
Bengston. 
</P>
<P>
 The most heroic of Dixon's paintings is "Earth Knower." The Native American 
depicted is swathed in a dark blanket. Features and folds take on the 
topography of the surrounding hills. The hills have the color and weave of 
tribal patterns, of blankets and baskets that were the unself-conscious 
masterpieces of this land's original inhabitants. Like them, Dixon harmonized 
the human and the earthiness into a single entity.

TV REVIEW; SUSPENSEFUL, HISTORICAL 'RACE TO FREEDOM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Race to Freedom: The Underground Railroad" is terrific TV for young viewers 
unfamiliar with the United States' pre-Civil War racial history. 
</P>
<P>
 And for older audiences familiar with the saga of blacks escaping to Canada 
and outwitting the clutches of the repugnant 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, this 
production is as suspenseful, if not as lavish, as historical drama on TV 
usually gets.(It airs at 8 tonight on two cable outlets -- the Family Channel 
and BET.) 
</P>
<P>
 Following in the tradition of "Roots" and "The Autobiography of Miss Jane 
Pitman," "Race to Freedom" is the story of four slaves fleeing a North Carolina 
plantation for Canada, the "promised land," where bounty hunters can't legally 
touch them. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling by night on the so-called underground railroad -- in essence a 
network of friendly, above-ground shelters identified by candles burning in the 
windows -- the runaway slaves beat a desperate path to the Ohio River, where 
they encounter the underground railroad's real conductor, Harriet Tubman, who 
puts them on a genuine train for the Canadian border, where more trauma awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot in Ontario and co-starring Janet Bailey as a young plantation housekeeper 
reluctant to face the perils of freedom and Courtney Vance as her gritty 
fiancee, the movie is tightly directed by Don McBrearty from a compelling 
teleplay by Diana Braithwaite, Nancy Botkin and Peter Mohan.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the creators take some romantic license but hardly enough to tarnish the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey shines in her growth from docility to heroism, and the movie features 
flinty supporting performances (among them Dawnn Lewis' powerfully etched 
runaway, Glynn Turman's chilly bounty hunter and executive producer Tim Reid's 
Frederick Douglass. 
</P>
<P>
 The show resourcefully captures the 1850s with minimal production sophistry, 
and it's enriched by Melba Moore's soaring off-screen vocal motif of "Oh, 
Freedom."

ART REVIEW; DELAP: AT WORK IN 'HOUSE OF THE MAGICIAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Delap's art took wing in the '60s among that flock that distilled the 
youth cults of hot-rod and surfboard into the Southland Slick School. The whole 
enterprise played to the accompaniment of waves of pop music. The pertinent 
ditty for Delap was certainly the Lovin' Spoonful's "Do You Believe in Magic?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now, three decades later, all that is a history to be sorted and mulled. At 
present Cal State Fullerton's gallery director Mike McGee offers contemplation 
of Delap's work in an installation blending re-created works and graphics that 
span the decades, making something of a vest-pocket retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a handsome catalogue designed by Jerry Samuelson that contains 
ponderable essays by Peter Clothier and David Pagel. The whole flies under the 
title "The House of the Magician," bringing us back to the old song. The magic 
it wanted accepted was that old black type called love or, more properly, sex. 
In radical contrast to the puritanical present, sex was immensely fashionable 
in the '60s. It is a great metaphor for Delap's art, which is all about the 
fact that we continue to believe in certain illusions even after we know how 
they work. 
</P>
<P>
 The most uncharacteristic but visually delightful piece on view is "Floating 
Lady." The role is played in rotation by a series of female student volunteers. 
At first glance the piece seems to present an approximation of the old stage 
magician's levitation trick. The woman hovers in the air, suspended above a 
folding chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Mind you, it's perfectly obvious she is resting on a horizontal support, a 
kind of shelf contraption. Yet one wonders how the shelf is held firm by the 
flimsy chair and how it supports the weight of the young woman. But the 
ultimate fascination takes place in the viewer's mind. Rather than denounce the 
piece to ourselves as a cheap trick, we prefer to maintain it as a wonderful 
thing. We insist on believing in it with the same fervor that we cling to 
romance after we know it's a biological joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Floating Lady" inexplicably but firmly brings the Cool School's old master 
guru to mind -- Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp made us see all manner of objects as 
artworks by waving the magic wand of the artist's wit, will and irony. He 
planted the notion that art is a patent illusion that works because artist and 
viewer alike wish to suspend disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Literal suspension dominates much of Delap's work. "Large Blue Beam" greets 
viewers at the door. It hovers nose-high, seeming to emerge at an angle from 
the far wall passing through a glass pane. "Floating Lady III" is a wood beam 
across the gallery space. Ordinary enough, except a gap in the middle seems to 
make it defy gravity. Oh. A piece of Plexiglas spans the gap. That explains it. 
But not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houdin's House" is named for a French magician who inspired Harry Houdini. 
It's a three-sided metal enclosure with two panes of glass angled from the 
center to the open corners. The glass reflects surroundings but the mirrored 
images seem to be on the metal walls where they don't belong. Delap's deadpan 
delivery makes the illusion delightful. Earnest historians will note that the 
work makes a bridge between the Finish Fetish a la Billy Al Bengston and Larry 
Bell's version of Light and Space art. 
</P>
<P>
 Delap's graphic series have more relaxed fun than his minimalist sculpture. He 
shows a Parisian Ferris wheel with only one spoke, an ace disappearing into a 
prestidigitator's palm, and a stick that levitates from a thumb. It doesn't 
minimize the wizardry at all that these effects are simple cut-and-paste 
graphic design devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Delap's greatest achievement may be in providing an open sesame to the 
Southland aesthetic. To this day his colleagues from Ken Price to Ed Moses and 
Bob Graham strive to "make it magic."

THEATER BEAT: 'NAUGHTY!' AT THE MELROSE: TEDIOUS, TERMINALLY CUTE

 Sometimes sin is provocative. And sometimes, as in "Naughty, Naughty!," sin is 
just a three-letter word. This tedious, terminally cute revue at the Melrose 
Theatre is even more more depressing because of the troupe's youth.Evidently 
these California Institute of the Arts alumni have nothing more on their minds 
than careerism, celebrities and whatever is currently selling on the comedy 
cable channel. There's no worry about censorship here. These kids automatically 
censor their material to accommodate the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's most entertaining sketch concerns an alcoholic "Annie." The best 
writing can be located in the program, where director Matt Olmos lists his 
latest achievements: " . . . Yada. Blah blah. Blah." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Naughty, Naughty!," Melrose Theatre, 733 N. Seward, Hollywood. Saturdays, 
10:30 p.m. Ends March 12. $8. (310) 281-1921. Running time: 2 hours, 15 
minutes. Version of 'Elektra' a Murky Venture 
</P>
<P>
 Sophocles' "Elektra" would be difficult under any condition, but director 
James Burke has incorporated quake repairs and scaffolding into his production 
design at Ivy Sub-Station. Furthering his chaotic concept, Burke concocts a 
melange of performance styles, from camp to sitcom to Brechtian, and then 
tosses in a cowboy costume for good measure. (Orestes has returned to right the 
wrongs of yesteryear, and therefore is a cowboy.) The result is murky at best, 
incoherent at its worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaos is compounded by Ezra Pound's translation/adaptation. Pound's 
occasional forays into theater were erratic, and infuriatingly prosaic. This 
mixture of modern and antique styles eludes dramatic coherence. Perhaps Burke 
was trying to accurately stage Pound's esoteric and eclectic theories, but even 
as an academic exercise, this "Elektra" lacks educational focus.

MOVE-IN READY; FRESH PAINT. NEW CARPET. LOTS OF LIGHT AND OPEN SPACE. MUST SEE 
TO APPRECIATE. SOME O.C. AGENTS AND DESIGNERS THINK THEY HAVE THE KEY TO 
UNLOCKING A HOUSE'S SALES POTENTIAL, EVEN IN A SLUGGISH MARKET.

 Thinking about planting a "For Sale" sign in front of your house? Better tour 
some model homes first. Then reach for the paint roller, wallpaper remover and 
the phone numbers of your favorite home improvement professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's recession-battered resale market is so competitive, real 
estate agents say, that successful sellers these days are the ones who make 
their properties look like model homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many others for buyers to choose from. Sellers are competing 
with one another and with new-home builders," said Tom Nash of Re/Max of 
Irvine, who specializes in residential sales. Agents who once simply advised 
sellers to clean out their closets and put on soft music to sway buyers now 
offer computerized lists of suggested improvements. Some refer their clients to 
interior designers to get a fresh perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 At the minimum, today's sellers find themselves cleaning, rearranging 
furniture, uncluttering and depersonalizing their homes before they are listed. 
Others install new carpeting, remove wallpaper, repaint walls, redo kitchen 
countertops and send appliances out for refinishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some determined sellers replace old aluminum sliding doors with French doors, 
install new chandeliers or add electric fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who want to sell are competing with the architecture of the '90s -- 
clerestory windows, plant ledges, dramatic high ceilings and lots of light, 
open spaces, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very specific, even adamant about things that need to be changed. When 
you take a car that's been off-road to a dealership, they don't put it on the 
lot that way. Each home should have a good going over, a detailing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers must decide how much time and money they can or will spend polishing 
up the place, weighing factors such as cash available, need for repairs, 
condition of competing properties and importance of a timely sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the basics that designers and real estate agents recommend -- such as 
painting and removing clutter -- are not costly, though. 
</P>
<P>
 To help give their lived-in abodes the look of a model home, some sellers are 
hiring interior designers who specialize in redecorating for resale. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior designer Joan Linder of Newport Beach is among those who will analyze 
a house and present the owner with a checklist of recommendations to make it 
more attractive to buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Nutting, also an interior designer, specializes in resale work as well. 
For years, he has worked on high-end properties on the Newport Beach market, 
but lately owners of properties in the medium price range are also seeking 
help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers typically charge $50 to $100 per hour, but some offer their services 
to home sellers for a set fee that may be lower. 
</P>
<P>
 What they offer, they say, is a fresh look at your house -- a place you may be 
too comfortable with to see through the eyes of a potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Mission Viejo home that had been on the market for six months, Linder 
spent five hours rearranging the furniture. She added a few new accessories, 
but the key change was eliminating unneeded furniture, creating conversational 
groupings and incorporating the stereo equipment that had lined the walls into 
existing bookcases. When the owner returned, she couldn't believe it was the 
same house, Linder said. It sold within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just balance and proportion can do so much. Sometimes all you have to do is 
rearrange the pictures and lamps and create an intimate setting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She often does more than that, though. For one client, Linder began on the 
outside to make an older house look larger and more modern. She had the brown 
trim, brick columns and side fences painted white to blend with the ivory 
stucco. Inside she added a focal point for the living room, an electric 
fireplace with black marble hearth and mantel. Some furniture was rented to 
complete the look; carpets were cleaned, and a soft drapery top was added to 
vertical blinds in the living room. The house sold in four weeks, she said. In 
this case, money spent on improvements boosted the house into a higher sales 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 But in most cases, improvements made to market the house are just going to put 
it one step ahead of the competition, Nutting said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are going to spend money, Nutting says it should be spent on the 
background. His advice: Invest in an inexpensive carpet that looks clean and 
new, bright, white paint, strategically placed blooming plants at the entrance 
and perhaps one piece of furniture in the right spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Many real estate agents are quick to point out that sellers today often have 
financial problems and can't afford to spend money on pre-sale improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents are seeing a lot of deferred maintenance now that they haven't seen in 
the past, said Mission Viejo-based Nancy Gromme of Century 21 Freedom Realty 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sales and buyer interest are up, prices are soft, and in many cases 
the sales price barely covers the sellers' loan, said Cherie Hartman, branch 
manager of Coldwell Banker's Dana Point-San Clemente office. 
</P>
<P>
 In those cases, the sales agents agree that the best thing to do is spend 
whatever you can to make the outside look attractive, clean the inside and 
remove clutter, personal items and large pieces of furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Herrera of Casa Blanca Realtors in Orange tells his clients not to 
spend too much on major remodeling because they are not going to recoup that 
money in the form of a higher sales price. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers, particularly in the older areas of the county where Herrera 
concentrates his efforts, are making very low offers, he said. He says money is 
better spent on a professional home inspection so sellers will know what they 
need to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buyers nowadays bring in their own inspectors to find leaks under the sink, 
loose toilets and improper wiring in the garage. The sellers may not want to 
fix everything, but at least they'll be aware of it" and be one step ahead of 
the potential buyer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After making decisions about repairs, you can concentrate on making your house 
look its best with these tips from designers and real estate agents: 
</P>
<P>
 * Open up spaces and make rooms look bigger by putting excess furniture in 
storage. Nutting says houses actually sell better when they are empty. "People 
are looking at your furniture and family pictures instead of the house," he 
said. Others, however, say it's better to have some furniture, even if you just 
create a fireplace grouping with a wing chair, table and lamp. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let in more light and update the room by taking down heavy window coverings. 
If there's a view, simply leave the windows bare so buyers can see it. If not, 
add window coverings that are light and inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider having appliances from another era refinished. Linder said it costs 
about $125 to refinish a refrigerator, an update she says is often worth the 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create focal points in rooms. Some homes have no focal points, and others 
have too many, Linder said. Simply putting a bright floral arrangement on a 
table can create a focal point. A strategically placed folding screen can 
eliminate focal points in a room with too many windows and doors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take the emphasis off problem spots by directing the viewer's eye elsewhere. 
If a floor is not in good shape, put down an area rug to create a focal point. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buy a new blanket in a compatible color and lay it corner to corner over a 
shabby bedspread, suggests Laguna Niguel interior designer Betty D. Hyde, who 
has done a lot of resale design work. You get a new look for a small price, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clean chrome bathroom fixtures with lemon oil to make them sparkle or buy 
new fixtures, Hyde recommends. She suggests buying a few new towels in fresh, 
bright colors and using scented bath oil often to make the whole house smell 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many designers advise painting dark woods white for a more contemporary 
look. Dark carpeting also has to go, according to Nash. And while you've got 
the paint out, Nutting advises, remember to paint the insides of cabinets as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make a small bedroom look larger by unifying elements. In one house, Linder 
used a decorative screen to cover a window and repeated the screen on a nearby 
wall. Large-scale pictures also make a room look bigger, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * When it's time to show the house, make sure the dishes are put away, the 
toilet seats are down and soft music is playing.

GARDENING; FRESHEST SOURCE FOR A STIR-FRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As familiarity with the cooking styles of Asian countries increases in 
Southern California, so is local interest in growing Oriental vegetables. While 
some of the specialty vegetables are carried at Asian markets and some 
supermarkets, many are still hard to find fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that many are easy to grow and do well in our mild climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are able to grow almost anything here that can be grown in China, Korea, 
Japan and other Asian countries," says certified nurseryman Steve Kawaratani, 
who is landscape manager of Laguna Nursery in Laguna Beach. "We have the added 
bonus of having a 10-month growing season here, compared to two to three months 
in many other areas, which means a higher yield," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although vegetables such as Chinese bitter melon, bok choy and daikon (a type 
of radish) are not common in many Orange County gardens, they are a staple in 
Asian gardens and kitchens. "Southern California gardeners have traditionally 
produced the standard beans, peppers, tomatoes and eggplants," says seed 
specialist Andrew Goldsmith of San Clemente. He oversees the Southern 
California region for Vaughan's Seed Co., which sells vegetable seeds to 
greenhouses, nurseries and farmers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Growing Oriental vegetables gives people a chance to try a variety of 
vegetables with new flavors, colors and textures," says Goldsmith, who 
regularly visits Japan to work with seed companies there to determine what 
Oriental vegetable types grow best in California. "Having these vegetables on 
hand also enables you to prepare authentic ethnic dishes," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you can find Oriental vegetables in the market, they're always much 
fresher and better tasting from your own back yard," Kawaratani says. "You can 
also garden organically."  
</P>
<P>
 While the list of Oriental vegetables is long, there are several popular types 
that do well in Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 If it's peppers you yearn for, Goldsmith suggests growing the shishito pepper, 
a mild light green Japanese pepper about two to three inches long that is often 
used in stir-fries. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also tomatoes to choose from, such as the Japanese tomato odoriko. 
This small pink vegetable has a slightly pointed end and exceptional flavor, 
Goldsmith says.  
</P>
<P>
 In cucumbers you may want to try the Tasty Green, which is a dark green 
burpless Japanese slicer that grows up to 10 inches.  
</P>
<P>
 Market Express is a small white Japanese turnip one to two inches long with 
dark green leaves. This is heat-tolerant and does very well in Southern 
California.  
</P>
<P>
 Also popular is the kabocha, which means winter squash or pumpkin in Japanese. 
These squash are known for their dark golden-orange skin, says Goldsmith, 
noting that this vegetable is often grown here and sent to Japan. He suggests 
the Honey Delite, a large squash with good taste. 
</P>
<P>
 A vegetable that many non-Asians have heard about but aren't familiar with 
growing is bok choy. This white Chinese cabbage is tender, sweet and very mild. 
In Asian cooking, bok choy is often prepared alone or mixed with meats and in 
soups. Because this vegetable tends to be large, gardeners with limited space 
may want to try a dwarf variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all Oriental vegetables, the snow pea is perhaps the most widely known and 
grown. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach gardener Herb Lee regularly grows a large crop of snow peas. 
"They are my favorite vegetable," he says, adding that he will prepare them 
alone or mix them into noodles or in stir-fries.  
</P>
<P>
 Lee also enjoys the shiny purple Japanese eggplant. This he slices and sautes 
with beef, pork or tofu. Two popular varieties are ichiban and Long Tom. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashok Saggar, a native of India and an avid gardener, also names Japanese 
eggplant as a favorite vegetable, but he prepares it differently -- adding 
spices and sauteing it with potatoes.  
</P>
<P>
 Saggar said he began growing Oriental vegetables years ago when he moved to 
the United States and couldn't find any of his favorites. On a visit to India, 
he picked up a supply of seeds, came back and started planting.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Saggar and his family enjoy a variety of Oriental vegetables from his 
Newport Beach garden. Among their favorites is the Chinese bitter melon ( foo 
gwah ), a long, pale-green lumpy vegetable that is bitter even after it's been 
cooked. Saggar likes the bitter melon cut into small pieces and cooked with 
onions, tomatoes and spices.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese winter melon ( doong gwah ) has white firm flesh, and some say it 
looks like a watermelon. Although the Chinese typically make winter melon soup 
with this vegetable, Saggar has a very different use for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grate the entire winter melon, including the skin, and mix it with ground 
lentils and spices," he says. "Then we use the mixture to make small cakes, 
which we dry in the sun for a week." 
</P>
<P>
 These rock-hard cakes can be reconstituted in water and will keep for a couple 
of years if stored properly in an airtight jar, he says. They are considered a 
delicacy and impart great flavor to many dishes.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An unusual variety of bean found in many Oriental vegetable gardens is the 
yard-long bean ( dow gauk ). 
</P>
<P>
 This dark-green Chinese bean can grow to 18 inches long. Saggar likes them, he 
says, because even when cooked, they do not become mushy like other beans. He 
cuts them into small pieces and adds spices, onions and fresh ginger. 
</P>
<P>
 Saggar says the Oriental ginger root he likes to grow flavors nearly every 
dish his wife makes. This is a bulb that grows in the ground for a year and is 
harvested in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustard greens are another Asian delicacy found in many dishes. They are used 
like spinach and can be eaten raw or cooked and mixed into different dishes.  
</P>
<P>
 Another basic vegetable is the daikon, a radish that can grow up to two feet 
long. These are eaten cooked and raw and are commonly used in soups, stir-fries 
and salads. 
</P>
<P>
 To plant Oriental vegetables, seeds are your best choice because they are 
economical and more readily available than plants, although you can find some 
plants in nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 Warm-season plants such as eggplants, cucumbers, melons, tomatoes, beans and 
peppers can be seeded in the next month or so indoors and will be ready for 
transplant in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool-season crops such as snow peas and mustard greens can be seeded directly 
in the ground now and should give a crop before the weather gets too warm.  
</P>
<P>
 When seeding indoors, make sure to use a light potting mix that is high in 
vermiculite and/or perlite, or add these ingredients to lighten your potting 
soil. Let the seeds germinate in a sunny window, and once the plants come up, 
slowly introduce them to the outdoors.  
</P>
<P>
 Before planting Oriental vegetables, soil preparation is very important. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secret to good vegetables is the soil itself," says Saggar, who has 
worked on improving his soil for 10 years. He uses homemade compost and 
fertilizes with composted rabbit and chicken manure.  
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that many of these plants do best in acid soils. In Orange 
County, soil tends to be alkaline. Nurseryman Kawaratani suggests having your 
soil tested by taking a sample to your local nursery or testing it yourself. 
You want the pH to be 6.0 to 6.5.  
</P>
<P>
 To acidify an alkaline soil, there are several amendments you can use, 
including gypsum, which besides lowering pH will lighten heavy clay soil. Leaf 
mold and soil sulfur will also acidify soil. Other good soil lighteners include 
planter's mix, sand, vermiculite and redwood compost. 
</P>
<P>
 Planting location for your vegetables is also important. In general, Oriental 
vegetables require an average of seven hours of sun a day. Some plants such as 
leaf crops can often go with a little less sun, and some fruiting vegetables 
such as eggplant often need all-day sun to do well.  
</P>
<P>
 Many Oriental vegetables thrive in containers, says Kawaratani, who suggests 
using no smaller than a 15-gallon pot. Be careful not to crowd the vegetables 
when planting in containers or the ground, he cautions, as overcrowding will 
lead to reduced yields.  
</P>
<P>
 A 15-gallon container will comfortably hold just one eggplant, a couple snow 
pea plants, one kohlrabi and a couple heads of bok choy, Kawaratani says.  
</P>
<P>
 Fertilize your Oriental vegetable plants on a regular basis with a general 
all-purpose fertilizer. Kawaratani suggests looking for a ratio of 2-1-1 when 
the plant is growing and then switching to 1-2-1 or 1-2-2 once the plant starts 
fruiting.  
</P>
<P>
 One drawback to our mild, almost perpetual growing season is the constant 
presence of pests, which Kawaratani says are able to over-winter in the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent pest damage, keep all vegetables away from the soil. It's also a 
good idea to regularly visually inspect your vegetables and pull off any pests. 
</P>
<P>
 If the infestation is too heavy, try spraying the plants with water, which is 
particularly effective with aphids, or bring in friendly pest predators, such 
as ladybugs. If these methods don't work, try an insecticidal soap.  
</P>
<P>
 Keep plant roots cool in summer by mulching with products such as planter mix 
and homemade compost, and watering on a regular basis. A drip irrigation system 
is often the most expedient method. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Oriental vegetable seeds and even plants are becoming easier to 
obtain, you may want to save your own seeds, as Saggar does. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a complete supply of seeds and never buys unless he finds a new 
variety.  
</P>
<P>
 To save Oriental vegetable seeds, Saggar says, toward the end of a plant's 
growing season single out a piece or two of produce that is healthy and large 
and leave it alone, allowing it to grow big and dry out some.  
</P>
<P>
 Just before the vegetable starts to burst, pick the produce, cut it open and 
spread the seeds on a paper towel. Separate the seeds from the pulp and place 
them in the sun to dry for a couple days.  
</P>
<P>
 Then store the seeds in labeled plastic bags and put them in the refrigerator.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: 2-CHANNEL CORDLESS PHONE HAS DIFFICULTY GETTING 
CLEAR SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Question: I have a 5-year-old cordless telephone that works great; however, 
lately I've been getting a lot of interference on the line. It sounds like 
another conversation my neighbors are having on their phone. Is there anything 
I can do to the phone to prevent it from picking up other conversations? 
</P>
<P>
 D.H. 
</P>

 Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "I'd guess that yours is probably a two-channel phone," says telephone 
installer Frank Slemons of Anaheim. "These phones have become so popular lately 
that by using the two-channel models, you just won't get a clear signal. Most 
cordless models today have 10 channels, which gives you a much better chance of 
finding a channel that's clear. Other than switching to a new phone, you could 
try moving it to various places in the house where you could find better 
reception." 
</P>

 Q: I'd like to paint the interior of my house, and I want to paint the outlets 
and outlet covers to match the rooms. Do these need to be prepared in some 
special way? 
</P>
<P>
 S.S. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 A: "First of all, turn the power off to the room you're working on," says 
Barbara Brobst of Hal's Paint & Decorating in Fullerton. "You should remove the 
outlet covers and wash them to remove any dust and dirt. Be sure to also clean 
off the outlets themselves. Paint over them lightly with a good brush. Using 
too thick a coat could make it a problem sticking things into the outlet." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I want to put a wallpaper border up in one of our bedrooms that has already 
been papered. The room has a vaulted ceiling that slants upward. Should I put 
the border along the ceiling or should I drop it lower, where the ceiling 
rises? 
</P>
<P>
 R.E. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Normally, a border follows the lower point in the ceiling and goes all the 
way around the room," says Gene Teramura of Dutch Boy Home Decorating Center in 
Santa Ana. "So if the ceiling is eight feet at its lowest point, the border 
would be applied eight feet high around the room. But, of course, if you like 
the look of the border slanting up to follow the ceiling, you can do it. Also, 
remember that you'll need to use a vinyl adhesive when applying the border to 
paper that's already up, otherwise it won't attach very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have an 8-year-old refrigerator that works except for the light bulb. 
Over the past year and a half, we've had to replace three of them. What could 
be the reason? 
</P>
<P>
 W.W. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
 A: "The problem may not be the refrigerator," says Tom Houlihan of Orange 
County Appliance Parts in Garden Grove. "Usually if there's a short in the 
system, the bulb will burn out immediately. I'd check first to see what kind of 
bulbs you're using. You should be getting appliance bulbs that are designed to 
work in the heat of ovens or the cold of refrigerators.  
</P>
<P>
 "Also, make sure you're getting brand-name bulbs; the cheaper ones don't 
usually last as long. Other than that, make sure your racks are arranged so 
that bottles or cartons aren't hitting the bulb area when you're pulling things 
out of the refrigerator." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: On the second floor of our house, we get all kinds of squeaks when walking 
in various rooms. We're going to be putting in new carpeting soon, and I'd like 
to pull our old carpet up now and correct any problems with the subfloor. I 
could hammer down any nails that have popped up, but wouldn't it be better to 
use screws? 
</P>
<P>
 L.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 A: "If the squeaking is coming from those boards that have popped up over 
time, you probably will notice a difference if they're screwed down," says 
carpenter Nick Howard of Santa Ana. "If they're screwed in, they're less likely 
to be pried upward over time. Drill a pilot hole before trying to drill the 
screw in, and be sure you walk the floor carefully before putting the new 
carpeting down to make sure your squeaking problem is gone."

GARDENING; CHECKING YOUR METHODS IS FAR FROM MADNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever you try something new in gardening, it makes sense to devise ways to 
determine whether it made a difference. Otherwise, you can never be sure that 
it is worth repeating. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you plan to try different pansies, grow some of last season's 
types alongside the new ones. That will provide a side-by-side reference. 
</P>
<P>
 Or in applying a mulch, leave some plants without any. Did those that weren't 
mulched need watering more often? Did the mulch attract damaging insects? Did 
it improve the appearance of the garden? 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if considering a new fertilizer, use the regular type on half the plants 
and the new one on the others. Then judge the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers use double-blind tests on such projects. Gardeners need nothing 
that elaborate. If you feel the new approach was better, you can safely adopt 
it for your conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 But this does require observation. And unless there is some check, there is no 
way to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, it could just mean that the season was particularly good and 
everything would have performed as well anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't be influenced by the "we-have-always-done-it-that-way" factor. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, take the recommended way to dig holes for new plants. For 
generations, the method of choice was a hole about twice the diameter and depth 
of the root ball and the blending of at least 33% soil amendments, such as peat 
moss, into the backfill. 
</P>
<P>
 But the University of Arizona's Jimmy L. Tipton says "new research clearly 
shows traditional techniques aren't best for new plants." He says they work 
against the desirable, quick establishment of a wide, lateral root system that 
supports a plant and absorbs water and nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
 What's better, he believes, is no amended backfill and a planting hole no 
deeper than the root ball but three to five times its diameter. He feels that 
roots will not extend easily beyond a highly amended backfill and, besides 
that, most native soil has a higher water-holding capacity, promoting growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinc sulfate has been touted as a way to control thrips on roses by applying a 
cup under the bush before the bloom period. Try it on half of your roses and 
see if it makes a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 In much of the West, many professionals believe gypsum (calcium sulfate) will 
help cure many soil problems, much as lime does in the East. One common test of 
gypsum's effectiveness is to use a stick to mark a 5-by-5-foot piece of ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Gypsum is sprinkled on one half and nothing on the other half. Both halves are 
watered normally. After the soil dries, gypsum advocates say you will see that 
the gypsum-covered soil will be puffier and looser looking. 
</P>
<P>
 But where sodium in soil or water is not a problem, this won't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Epsom salts provide another example. Many rose growers swear by the 
effectiveness of this soluble form of magnesium sulfate. Plants do need trace 
amounts and magnesium is a little bit stronger than sodium in clinging to soil, 
so it can replace the sodium. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many experts consider gypsum and Epsom salts worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 So it seems to depend on local conditions. Which brings us back to square one: 
Make your own tests and keep records.

DO-IT-YOURSELF; RESTORE HARDWOOD FLOOR, START TO FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you decide to tackle restoring a worn hardwood floor that has a clear 
finish, plan on a week's worth of work. 
</P>
<P>
 You will need a day to prepare the space and gather materials and tools, 
another to sand and several more to apply the finish and allow drying time 
between coats. You can save time by asking someone to help you. Preparation and 
Tools 
</P>
<P>
 If a finish is severely damaged and the flooring is at least one-fourth inch 
thick, it should be stripped with a sander before refinishing. You can rent 
equipment. A drum-type floor sander handles most of the floor refinishing. Use 
a hand-held disc sander, or edger, to sand stair treads and along baseboards, 
in corners, inside closets and in other places that are inaccessible to the 
large drum sander. Hand-sand spots that neither sander reaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Have a salesperson show you how to operate the machines and how to change the 
sandpaper. Stock up on sandpaper and be sure that you have the right tools for 
attaching the sandpaper to the sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare for sanding by removing all rugs, furniture and other furnishings in 
the room. Carefully take off the quarter-round shoe moldings along the 
baseboards. (Number the moldings and their places on the wall so that you can 
put them back.) Cover all vents. Seal doorways and windows from the rest of the 
house with plastic sheeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspect the floor carefully. Pull out any staples left from carpeting. Drive 
any visible nailheads one-eighth inch below the surface using a nail set and 
fill the holes with wood putty. Repair cracks and secure loose floorboards. 
Vacuum and thoroughly inspect the floor once more. Sanding 
</P>
<P>
 For sanding, wear goggles, a dust mask and ear protection. To avoid marring 
the floor, don heavy socks or clean, white-soled sneakers. Remember that 
sanding dust, finishes and finish fumes are flammable. Don't smoke. Extinguish 
pilot lights on nearby appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Sand the floor first with the drum sander and 36-grit paper. Raise the sander 
off the floor, turn on the power, then lower the drum carefully, keeping a firm 
grip on the handles. Work across the floor -- always with the grain -- then 
return to the beginning and strip the next section parallel to and slightly 
overlapping the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an industrial drum floor sander is like walking a headstrong dog. Your 
job is to let it pull you, but not as fast as it can. Always keep the machines 
moving or the sander will "eat down" into the floor and leave an uneven 
surface. Wearing work gloves will ease the pressure on your hands. Repeat the 
sanding process twice, using 80-grit sandpaper, then 100-grit paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, sand along the walls with the edger. Hold both handles firmly and keep 
the disc flat on the floor to avoid gouging. Sand with the same succession of 
paper grades as you used on the main floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a block of wood wrapped with sandpaper or a paint scraper to clean even 
the tightest areas -- in corners and under radiators -- where neither power 
sander can reach. Finally, hand-sand, working with the grain, to remove swirls 
caused by the edger. Vacuum thoroughly between sanding stages. Apply Finish 
</P>
<P>
 After sanding, vacuum the floor and walls using the brush attachment. Wipe 
down moldings, windowsills and door frames so that dust won't fall off later 
and mar the finish. Let dust settle overnight, then vacuum again. Wipe the 
floor thoroughly with a tack cloth, available in hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want floors to be only slightly darker than the bare wood, apply 
sealant of any kind. If you want the finish to have a darker tone, apply wood 
stain before the sealant. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil-base polyurethane is a popular floor finish because of its durability and 
ease of application. You need three coats when you use polyurethane as the 
final finish. Thin the first coat with one part mineral spirits to four parts 
polyurethane; this acts as a sealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Brush polyurethane across the grain and then along it. Use a long-handled 
roller to apply the finish on the main surface of the floor; use a small brush 
for the edges and corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Work in small sections, overlapping the strokes before the previous section is 
dry. Inexpensive foam rollers are best; just throw them away instead of 
cleaning them between coats. 
</P>
<P>
 Let each coat dry as directed before re-coating; observe ventilation 
precautions on the container. In between coats, buff with a rented 
floor-polishing machine equipped with superfine steel wool. After each buffing, 
vacuum well and clean with a tack cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow the finish to dry at least two days, then buff with superfine steel wool 
again and vacuum.

HOME SAFETY; EXTINGUISHER CAN SAVE POSSESSIONS AS WELL AS LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire extinguishers are important safety precautions that every home should 
have. Quick use of an extinguisher on a small fire can prevent it from becoming 
a serious blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 In case of a larger fire, always call the fire department first. Never try to 
fight it by yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 If a small fire begins to spread, have everyone leave the house immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three categories of fire -- A, B and C -- by which fire 
extinguishers are rated. Each kind of fire is extinguished differently: 
</P>
<P>
 * "A" fires burn to ash. They are fueled by wood, cloth, paper, most rubbish 
and some plastics. Water will put them out. 
</P>
<P>
 * "B" fires bubble. They involve flammable liquids and grease. Most kitchen 
fires are of this type. Never throw water on them; it will only splatter and 
spread the flames. For oven or broiler fires, turn off the heat and shut the 
door. If meat catches fire, put a lid over it. If the fire is on top of the 
stove, turn off the burner if possible, leave the pan where it is and smother 
the flames with a lid. Or douse the fire with handfuls of baking soda or salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Never put baking powder, sugar or flour on a fire. Sugar will burn and baking 
powder or flour dust may explode. 
</P>
<P>
 * "C" fires involve electrical power. These occur in electrical wiring or 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Unplug the appliance or shut off the power and use an all-purpose ("ABC") fire 
extinguisher. Never throw water on a "C" fire; a serious shock or even 
electrocution may result. 
</P>
<P>
 An extinguisher's letter rating -- A, B, or C, or a combination of two or 
three -- indicates what kind of fires it can put out. The number preceding the 
letter rating, for example 1-A or 5-B, indicates the size of a standard test 
fire that the extinguisher can put out; the higher the number, the greater the 
extinguisher's firefighting capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire extinguishers are available in rechargeable and non-rechargeable 
(disposable) types. An extinguisher that cannot be recharged or that doesn't 
have a gauge is not as reliable as a rechargeable type. If you have a 
disposable extinguisher, it's a good idea to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rechargeable fire extinguishers are best because they have a gauge that 
indicates the pressure in the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspect the pressure gauge periodically. If the pressure drops, or if the 
extinguisher is used even briefly, have it recharged by an extinguisher service 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Before buying a fire extinguisher, check to see that it is easy to handle, 
especially by an elderly person or a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure that the operating directions, located on the canister, are clear. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also important that the extinguisher carry the Underwriter's Laboratory 
(UL) or Factory Mutual (FM) seal of approval. This indicates that the 
extinguisher model has been tested and provides the protection claimed on the 
label. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Install extinguishers in the kitchen and in or near the living room, bedrooms, 
basement and garage. Locate them in plain view, away from but convenient to 
fire hazards. Make sure the entire family knows how to use them. Keep one 
nearby when you are doing chores such as spray painting or car repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 For a car, select a 2 1/2-pound dry-chemical fire extinguisher (rated for 
class A, B, and C fires) to fight small interior fires that might be caused by 
a stray ash or an electrical malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the extinguisher inside the car, under the front seat or in the glove 
compartment. In the time it would take to retrieve the extinguisher from the 
trunk, the fire could be out of control.

WHAT THE OWNER SEES AS 'CHARM' COULD TURN OFF A POTENTIAL BUYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'DELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've grown accustomed to that crack in the ceiling, and you don't notice it 
anymore. The shrubs and bushes you put in 10 years ago may look overgrown to 
someone else; to you they're familiar friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that you want to sell, it's time to look at your home as a potential 
buyer would. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents and designers offer some tips on how to go about it: 
</P>
<P>
 * Stand at the curb and take a hard look at the exterior. Is the driveway 
greasy or cracked? Does the house need painting? Sometimes just painting the 
fascia and trim will do the trick. Add some bright flowers to the landscaping. 
Real estate agent Carlos Herrera says red, white and yellow blooms are the 
favorites. If the landscaping is in bad condition, it may be time to replace 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check the condition of the entryway flooring, then look up. Potential buyers 
always look up when going through a house, Herrera says. Cobwebs, ceiling 
cracks, water stains and aging light fixtures might be right in their line of 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is the wallpaper dated or too bold? If so, it should come down and be 
replaced by white, not off-white, paint or maybe a faux painting treatment to 
add depth. Never add new wallpaper, advises designer Walter Nutting, who says 
he has seen many cases where the homeowner installed new wallpaper to sell the 
house only to have the new buyer declare that it would be the first thing to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 * Are the appliances and ovens clean? Real estate agent Tom Nash says many 
buyers routinely look in the refrigerator. They believe its condition is a sign 
of how clean the rest of the house is. It's the same with shower stalls, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is there a lingering odor? Homeowners who have indoor pets should buy pet 
deodorizer and use it often. Nothing turns people off more than pet odors, says 
designer Betty Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is it dark inside? Nash recommends increasing the wattage in all lamps and 
turning on every light in the house, even on a sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Are window coverings heavy or outdated? Light and bright are today's 
preferred look. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove ashes from the fireplace. In winter, have fire burning; in summer, 
ferns or flowers can add fresh touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees on what buyers are looking for when they go through a 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Joan Linder says they are trying to see themselves in the home, which 
is why it is so important to remove family photographs, she says. "If there's 
already a family there, it doesn't work," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nutting says people are so used to going through new home models that they are 
comparing the home and the furniture with "the latest thing at Pelican Hill." 
He says houses sell better empty rather than furnished. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers generally breeze through the living room if it's a decent size and head 
for the kitchen and bathrooms, he said. Those rooms are what really date a 
house, and fairly simple changes such as refacing or repainting cabinets or 
replacing old tile counters can have a big impact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agent Nancy Gromme says most home shoppers have some piece of 
furniture in mind that they are trying to place in the room. "If they come from 
back East, they often have huge bedroom sets, and that can sometimes be a 
problem," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash says people have so many houses to choose from that what they are doing 
is eliminating, finding a reason why that house won't work for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's buyers, Nutting says, want to move in and not have to fix anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years back, people would buy 'charm' and spend time and money fixing it 
up. Those days are gone," he says. LYNN O'DELL

HOME SAFETY; YOUNG CHILDREN RUN GREATEST RISK OF PLANT POISONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One in 10 inquiries to poison control centers across the nation concern plant 
poisonings. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest danger from poisoning is to young children -- who like to taste 
everything as part of their explorations of the world around them. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the plant-related inquiries to poison centers concern children 
younger than 3 years; in only a small percentage of these cases does the child 
actually have symptoms of poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Philodendron and diffenbachia are responsible for the first and second most 
reported poisonings, respectively. These plants are in the Araceae family, a 
group of plants with needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate in the leaves and 
stems. 
</P>
<P>
 When chewed, the crystals cause immediate pain in the mouth and throat, which 
commonly leads to swelling. This makes speech difficult and is the origin for 
the common name dumbcane for diffenbachia species. 
</P>
<P>
 If enough philodendron or diffenbachia leaves are eaten, vomiting and 
diarrhea, even death, could follow. Other houseplants in this family include 
elephant's ear (Alocasia spp.), flamingo flower (Anthurium spp.) and caladium 
(Caladium bicolor). 
</P>
<P>
 Poinsettias are ranked third as far as the number of reported (not actual) 
poisonings nationwide. Actually, poinsettias are not poisonous -- but they have 
a reputation for being so. While the poinsettia is not toxic, it is a member of 
the spurge family, which includes many toxic plants. Guilt by association, 
perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the spurge family contain a milky latex in their sap, and this 
latex can cause dermatitis. A houseplant spurge that does warrant caution is 
the crown-of-thorns, which, as long as we are talking about danger to children, 
also is heavily armed with stout thorns. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bulbs are in the lily family, another family with many poisonous members. 
The daintiness of lily of the valley belies the fact that it contains a potent 
cardiac glycoside (much like the digitalis found in foxgloves), which even 
leaches into the water of cut flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyacinths are wonderfully fragrant, yet also toxic. All parts of daffodils 
contain lycorine, a toxic substance that can cause dermatitis with skin contact 
and diarrhea and convulsions if ingested. Lycorine is also found in another 
winter bulb, amaryllis (Hippeastrum spp.). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few other houseplants in widely scattered plant families also are toxic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jerusalem cherry ( Solanum pseudocapsicum ), a houseplant with brightly 
colored berries, is in the deadly nightshade family. The family name tells you 
something about the plant's toxic properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistletoe is not a houseplant, per se, yet it is a plant often in the house in 
wintertime. The white berries, which tend to fall to the ground as the plants 
dry, are toxic. The leaves of English ivy, grown indoors and out, are toxic 
also. 
</P>
<P>
 No need to cast a somber cloud over these houseplants. But it is important to 
know which are toxic so as to keep them beyond the inquisitive reach of very 
young hands.  
</P>
<P>
 If a child does ingest a plant, save part of the plant for positive 
identification, then call a poison control center. It is not always advisable 
to induce vomiting, as this can further spread irritating materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Now why does an otherwise friendly looking philodendron have to strike a 
menacing chord with a toxin in its leaves? 
</P>
<P>
 Inside our homes, over-watering or under-watering probably is the biggest 
threat to any houseplant's existence. 
</P>
<P>
 But out in the jungle, a philodendron needs some way to ward off a big gorilla 
who might find the leaves an appetizing salad. In this case, a burning, swollen 
mouth is a good deterrent.

DO-IT-YOURSELF; TOILET TIPS KEEP PROBLEMS FROM OVERFLOWING 
</P>

 Before making any repairs, remove the tank lid and study how the various parts 
of a toilet tank work together. Most function the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 When you push down on the flush handle, the lift arm to which it is connected 
raises the tank ball or flapper valve at the bottom of the tank. The discharge 
pipe opens, and water flows from the tank into the bowl. When the tank is 
nearly empty, the tank ball or flapper valve falls back down, cutting off the 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
 The float, which looks like the pump of a large perfume atomizer, descends 
with the water level. It opens the valve at the top of the inlet pipe, called 
the ball-cock valve, just as the discharge pipe is closed. This allows water to 
enter through the thin tank filler tube. The float rises as the tank refills. 
When it reaches a preset level, the tank is filled, and the ball-cock valve 
shuts off the water prompted by the float and its arm. 
</P>
<P>
 When you need a replacement part, look for the manufacturer's name and model 
number, which is often incised inside the lid of the tank. Buy a compatible 
part or bring the old one with you to a hardware store or plumbing shop and try 
to match it. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are points to check if a toilet fails to flush or doesn't flush 
completely: 
</P>
<P>
 * After removing the tank lid, note how the flush handle and flush valve link. 
If the handle is loose, tighten it on its shaft and tighten the screw holding 
it to the lift arm with a wrench. 
</P>
<P>
 * You may need to reconnect or replace the chain or wire that connects the 
lift arm to the flapper valve or tank ball. Make sure the tank ball or flapper 
is securely screwed or hooked to the chain or wire. 
</P>
<P>
 * The water in the toilet tank should be about a half-inch lower than the top 
of the overflow tube. If it's too low, raise the level by bending up the rod 
that connects the float to the ball-cock valve. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the water level is correct, check as you flush to see if the lift chain 
or wires pull the flapper or ball clear of the outlet valve seat. If not, 
reposition the wires or chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some additional trouble-shooting tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * If the tank doesn't fill and the water runs continuously, adjust the lift 
wire or chain so the tank ball or flapper drops straight into the valve seat. 
Gently scour the valve seat (the outlet to the bowl) with fine (No. 0) steel 
wool. Wash the tank ball or flapper. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you hear whistling, put new washers in the ball-cock valve plunger. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminate splashing sounds by repositioning the refill tube to eject water 
directly into the overflow tube. Or the ball-cock valve plunger may need new 
washers. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the tank sweats, insulate it by draining, cleaning and drying the inside. 
Then line it by cementing in sheets of polystyrene or foam rubber. You can get 
these in kit form. You can also have a plumber install a tempering valve that 
will warm the water in the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the tank leaks, check the connections to the water supply line and 
tighten them if necessary. Also check and tighten the bolts holding the tank to 
the bowl. Over-tightening may crack the toilet tank. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the toilet leaks at the base, the bowl may be cracked. Or the wax ring 
sealing the bowl to the drain is worn and must be replaced.

MAINTENANCE; TO FIGHT STAINS, TRY A HOME REMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To avoid airing your dirty household linens in public, you may want to try 
simple household remedies to either eliminate or lighten most spots caused by 
foods, beverages and other familiar offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases a stain or a spot should be treated before you wash the item, 
and as soon as possible after the stain has occurred. Early treatment 
facilitates stain removal and limits damage to fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Eckert, a designer who also restores vintage quilts, recommended this 
formula for lightening the brown spots and yellowed areas on old linens: Add a 
few drops of lemon juice and distilled water to a touch of Orvus, a mild 
PH-neutral cleanser recommended for washable textiles, to form a runny paste. 
Wet the stained area, dab on the mixture and let it set for 15 minutes. Rinse 
the item thoroughly in warm water. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert warned against using the mixture on colored linens, because the acid in 
the lemon can lighten or remove color. 
</P>
<P>
 English author Jane Newdick found a list of cleaning recipes in an old book, 
which included this one: Broil rhubarb stems, strain the juice and dab it, 
while still hot, on the stain. Then wash the item immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhubarb treats stains effectively because it contains oxalic acid, an antidote 
for many of the brown spots found on vintage linen and cotton textiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Textile conservator Nancy Lane Terry, a member of the American Institute of 
Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, warns that you should work 
carefully when applying to fabric any agent that contains acid. In general, it 
is best to use a weak solution. 
</P>
<P>
 If you own a valuable or fragile textile, it is best to determine what caused 
the stain before attempting to remove it. If you cannot identify the cause or 
you are afraid to try to remove the stain yourself, consult a textile 
conservator. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Durkson Clise, author of "The Linen Closet: How to Care for Your Fine 
Linens and Lace," offers a range of antidotes for common stains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Coffee and tea. If you are able to treat the stain immediately, apply a 
solution of one part borax and six parts water to the item. Wash in warm, soapy 
water using a gentle cleanser. If the stain has already dried, loosen it with 
an application of one part glyceride and one part water. To remove stains on 
sturdy fabrics, stretch the area over a bowl and pour a stream of boiling water 
through the stain from a height of 2 to 3 feet until the spot disappears. 
</P>
<P>
 * Berries, sand and fruit. To treat a wet stain, sprinkle the area with salt 
and rub it with damp soap. Allow to stand for a few hours, then rinse well. For 
dried stains, soak the item in a solution of one part borax and six parts 
water. For sturdy fabrics, you can also use the boiling-water technique. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wine. You can usually remove white wine stains with a hot, soapy washing. To 
treat red wine stains, sprinkle salt on the area and immerse the item in cold 
water. If the spot remains, rub it out with salt before washing the item. 
Another remedy for red wine stains is to saturate the area with club soda or a 
solution of baking soda and water.

ELECTRONICS; COMPONENTS CAN BE SPARED SHOCK OF VOLTAGE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Video enthusiasts pour much money and time into their equipment, yet valuable 
units are often left vulnerable to electrical damage. There are several 
products that can protect electronic components and even improve their 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem, under-voltage, occurs when there is a drop below the consistent 
120 volts normally supplied by utility companies. This situation produces 
temporary losses that, although they typically last only a fraction of a 
second, may upset the workings of personal computers and videocassette 
recorders. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the damage caused by under-voltage, users can buy an 
uninterruptible power supply for about $200 to $400 that enables the equipment 
to keep running long enough to be shut down properly. A UPS can also prevent 
VCR timers from "blacking out," ensuring that the system retains programmed 
information even during a prolonged power loss. 
</P>
<P>
 A far more dangerous problem, over-voltage, occurs when power flows into 
circuit boards faster than it can be dissipated. An over-voltage, also known as 
a surge or spike, can produce 6,500 volts, meaning that it has the potential to 
burn a system. Surge suppressors provide a safeguard by absorbing or rerouting 
excess electrical energy during overvoltages. 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems are known as radio frequency interference and electromagnetic 
interference. These cause audio buzzing and video distortion in the form of 
diagonal lines and static. RFI and EMI are most commonly produced by such 
sources as local radio stations, cellular phones and household appliances. Many 
surge suppressors include line conditioners that minimize or eliminate RFI and 
EMI noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Surge suppressors come in a variety of forms, with prices from $5 to more than 
$500. Prospective buyers should make sure the unit they choose has an 
Underwriters Laboratories 1449 listing, which means that the product meets 
minimum safety requirements for its intended use. 
</P>
<P>
 As for warranties, on some of the more expensive units these will cover not 
only the surge suppressor but also the equipment being protected by it. Special 
groundings or hookups may be necessary for the warranty to be valid, however. 
</P>
<P>
 For further protection, many insurance policies will cover electrical spike 
damage, and special riders and schedules are available for additional coverage.

O.C. STUDENT'S DISAPPEARANCE BAFFLES FAMILY, FRIENDS, POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The disappearance of Cathy Torrez doesn't make sense to anyone. Not to her 
family, the police, her teachers, her friends or her bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people run away all the time, they say, but not those like Torrez. 
</P>
<P>
 An honor student at Cal State Fullerton who also holds two jobs, the 
20-year-old Torrez calls her mother if she's going out after work. She has 
never been in trouble, used drugs or barhopped, they say. There are no angry 
ex-boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did Torrez disappear a week ago during her one-mile drive home from 
work? There is no evidence that she ran away or was abducted. She and her 
burgundy Toyota Corolla, license plate 2RMC785, simply vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Earth couldn't have just opened up and swallowed her," her mother, Mary 
Bennett, said Friday. Torrez lives with her mother, stepfather, a brother and 
one of her two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives and friends took calls from well-wishers Friday and distributed 
thousands of flyers to volunteers who are papering north Orange County. A 
week-old letter from a Cal State Fullerton dean congratulating Torrez on making 
last semester's honor roll sits on a table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who knows her knows she wouldn't just go away," Bennett said. 
"Something had to have happened to her, but we don't know what." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has Placentia police baffled. Her bank accounts haven't been touched, 
even though she only had $30 and no credit cards with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have followed leads, but there has been nothing to indicate foul play," 
Placentia police Detective Donna Rose said. "But she is not the type of 
20-year-old who would just leave, and that has us concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and family say that about 7:50 p.m. Feb. 12, Torrez called her mother 
from the Sav-On Drugs store at Bradford Avenue and Yorba Linda Boulevard, where 
she has worked for almost four years as a checker, and indicated she would be 
home shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8 p.m., the 4-foot-10 Torrez walked out of Sav-On to her car with a female 
co-worker, said "see you in the morning," and drove out of the lot, heading 
south on Bradford. Then she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 If she was going home, she would taken Bradford for one mile, passing several 
homes and apartments, Valencia High School -- her alma mater and other employer 
-- and St. Joseph's Catholic Church, where she would have slowed and blessed 
herself with the sign of the cross, her mother said. She would have stopped at 
one stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chapman Avenue, she would have stopped at a light, turned west and driven 
one block to her home. The trip should have taken five minutes at the longest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been back and forth, over and under everything in her life and there 
is nothing that tells us she wouldn't want to come home," said Ron Bennett, her 
stepfather. "It's confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez's mother sat patiently through one television interview after another 
in her living room Friday night, trying to get the word out about her 
daughter's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at the kitchen table, she said she sometimes thinks she hears her 
daughter at night tapping on her bedroom window. Debbie, Torrez's 13-year-old 
sister, awakens sometimes thinking Torrez is whispering to her. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, Bennett calls everyone who knows her daughter, trying to find 
a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless somebody is lying, no one has heard from her," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Lopez, Torrez's 22-year-old sister, keeps a log of everyone who has been 
contacted. She's convinced her sister wouldn't go anyplace alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "She couldn't go anywhere or do anything alone by herself," Lopez said, "not 
even the store. She would try to get somebody to go and if they couldn't, she 
wouldn't go. She couldn't even eat alone. She would make one of us come and sit 
with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Sav-On co-worker Lisa Ripley said that "except when she drove to work, I never 
saw her alone." 
</P>
<P>
 In front of Sav-On on Friday, Martin Torrez, her 19-year-old brother, was 
passing out flyers -- as he has every day since her disappearance -- hoping to 
find a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say they know her," he said as he handed a flyer to another 
Sav-On customer. "They all tell me how nice she is." 
</P>
<P>
 At Valencia High, where Torrez worked as a teacher's aide last semester, 
teacher Clara Rodriguez-Creger said she "is not the flighty type who would just 
take off. She cares too much about her family to leave without even a phone 
call. She is very responsible, and that is what is frightening to anyone who 
knows her." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Bennett says she just wants to know what happened, even if it turns out 
to be bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to know," Bennett said. "We will never be able to get on with our 
lives until we find out."

 ICE TRY: Maybe the gods weren't pleased. In an ice carving exhibition at the 
Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, Newport Beach's Mark Daukas and New Yorker 
Scott Rella sculpted Thor, the Norse god of thunder, from 10 300-pound blocks 
of ice. Daukas, who holds many national and international titles in ice 
carving, was expected to win. But he only got a citation for "innovation." . . 
. . Says a friend: "They were pretty bummed and not really happy with the 
judging." 
</P>
<P>
 FOR SHARON: A highlight of the Orange Coast College Symphony's performance at 
the school's Robert B. Moore Theatre Sunday night will be the seven-minute 
elegy "Ohio Girl." It's packed with meaning. . . . It's Huntington Beach 
composer Jim Weisheit's tribute to his cousin, Sharon Lane, the first Army 
nurse to be killed in the Vietnam War. . . . Says the college's orchestra 
director Alan Remington: "I defy anyone to sit down and listen to it without 
having tears come to their eyes. Jim put his heart and soul into this work." 
</P>
<P>
 DAVE'S SONG: Tony Bennett didn't leave his heart there, so "Seattle on the 
Puget Sound" hasn't caught on as a national treasure. But it's well known in 
Seattle. And native son Dave Holden, a jazz musician who's a regular at the 
Westin South Coast Plaza, wants that city to officially adopt it. He owns the 
rights to the song, written by his father. Says Holden, who lives in Huntington 
Beach: "I've been at this 35 years, and I always play that song. People here 
seem to love it."

 STAYING BUILT: Tonight's Afghan International Concert and Show at UC Irvine's 
Bren Event Center brings together peoples of Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, 
Tajikistan, India and Uzbekistan. They'll perform traditional music and dance 
from each land. Producer Ahmadshah Alam of New York organized the event in part 
to preserve critical but ephemeral aspects of the war-torn region. . . . . Says 
Alam: "You can rebuild the country, the houses, but when you lose the culture, 
you cannot rebuild it."

 GOING MODERN: The headquarters for the Armed Forces Radio and Television 
Network must be a Manhattan or Hollywood high-rise. Wrong! Believe it or not, 
the network broadcasts from Sun Valley in a building originally built as a bank 
computer center.. . . The network, which reaches 1.3 million military personnel 
in 128 countries, plays more Christian rock and fewer Bible services these 
days, and the soldiers like it.(B13)

 SCHOOL LOYALTY: They said they might bail, but the overwhelming majority of 
CalArts students are sticking with the earthquake-ravaged campus. Friday was 
the last day students could withdraw and receive a full refund, but only about 
80 of the 964 left.. . . The school estimates $2 million in bills for satellite 
classrooms and lost tuition. (B20) 
</P>
<P>
 BUMMED BOWLER: Pity Paul Hagerty. Rocket Bowl in Chatsworth, his weekly 
hangout for 14 years, won't reopen till early March because of earthquake 
damage, sending his mood straight into the gutter. "I miss it," he complained. 
"This is my home away from home. Other places charge too much money.". . . 
Besides, many (above) remain closed or overcrowded. (C14) 
</P>
<P>
 MODEL QB: Palmdale High's Rocque Sandoval, who has overcome far more than 
intimidating pass rushers, might find ex-Raider Jim Plunkett a perfect role 
model. Plunkett's parents were blind, yet he became a great player who took his 
team to two Super Bowl titles. . . . Sandoval's parents are deaf, but that 
hasn't stopped him from throwing touchdowns and picking up plenty of support 
from home. (C14)

 EVERYTHING COUNTS: Don't call tonight's taping of "The Jackson Family Honors" 
in Las Vegas a strictly charity event; much of the dough goes to cover

Committee of the Entertainment Industry in Studio City, will send some money 
raised to quake victims. Michael Arkush

CHAPMAN REVUES THE LATIN ROOTS OF ROCK; MUSIC: UNIVERSITY SHOW TRACES LARGELY 
UNHERALDED ROLE IN RHYTHMS RANGING FROM RAGTIME TO REGGAE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After 20 years of staging rock 'n' roll revues at Chapman University, you'd 
think Paul Frizler would have covered all the bases by now. But when someone 
suggested showcasing the Latin roots of popular music in the United States, 
Frizler was stumped. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there was "La Bamba," Santana and Los Lobos, but beyond that? "I 
thought, 'Oh God, it's going to be a very short show,' " Frizler said. But what 
he found was that music from Latin America and the Caribbean has played a 
surprisingly rich role in popular music, one that goes largely unheralded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the root that nobody explores," Frizler said, as he ticks off the 
Latino influences on performers such as Madonna, Ben E. King, the Police, and 
the group that did "Love Potion No. 9." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, he brings it all together in "From Ragtime to Reggae: The Latin Roots 
of Rock and Roll." Opening tonight in Chapman Auditorium, the splashy revue 
continues for the next three weekends, through March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The original idea for the show came from Allen Levy, an associate professor of 
public relations who had tried to sell it as a TV project a few years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I started researching the actual songs and influences, I noticed two 
things. First, there isn't very much literature" on the subject, Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, he found a much wider influence than even he expected. "What I thought 
was a trickle turned out to be a roaring river," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chronologically, the show ranges from W. C. Handy's 1914 ragtime standard "St. 
Louis Blues" (with its tango-inspired interlude) to such contemporary artists 
as Gloria Estefan and Los Lobos. One of the surprises that greeted Levy in his 
research was the interplay around the end of the 19th Century between tango, 
which swept up from Argentina, and early jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Tango "scandalized white America" because of its overt sexuality, Levy said, 
although a sanitized version later became popular. "Before that, the only 
people who really loved the tango (in the U.S.) were African Americans," Levy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right from there this Latin river flows through all forms of American popular 
music," said Levy, who co-wrote and co-produced the show with Frizler, who 
directs. The point of the revue is "to illuminate and celebrate a trend in 
American popular music that no one has ever revealed, not that I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Levy: "Everybody talks about multiculturalism. It's the buzzword of the 
'90s, right? We are doing something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Latin Roots" show fits right in with the university's current 
"Celebration of Latino Culture," a yearlong project that includes a steady 
calendar of lectures, concerts and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was that we wanted to be able to find a way to bring consciousness 
about various cultures" to the campus, said Cory Salcedo, a Chapman University 
administrator who is coordinating the program. The show, she said, will be a 
central event of the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 As with Frizler's past productions, this is a "clone show," in which costumed 
students and alumni portray the actual performers who sang the hits. Well 
before the "Beatlemania" stage show played across the country and before the 
explosion of Elvis impersonators, Frizler was dressing up his stars and turning 
them into everyone from Peggy Lee to Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 The current show incorporates the research by Frizler and Levy into a 
production that is "painlessly educational," Levy hopes. "It's not just a 
historical travelogue, it's a celebration. We party in this show." 
</P>
<P>
 Opening with Richie Valens' rendition of "La Bamba," a rock 'n' roll 
translation of a Mexican folk tune, the "Latin Roots" show moves into the 
largely unspoken influence of Latin rhythms on such '50s and '60s performers as 
the Clovers ("Love Potion No. 9"), Ben E. King ("Spanish Harlem"), the Drifters 
("Under the Boardwalk") and even Van Morrison, whose "Brown-Eyed Girl" was 
inspired, lyrically and musically, by a trip to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Such roots can be hard to spot, but are undeniably there, especially in the 
rhythms, Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the program reaches back to Handy's "St. Louis Blues" before exploring 
the big-band era, from the Latin influence on mainstream performers (Jimmy 
Dorsey's "Tangerine," for instance) to the Cuban invasion of such stars as Desi 
Arnaz and Xavier Cugat. In the show, Thora Fletcher of Mission Viejo sings a la 
Dinah Washington in a sultry "What a Difference a Day Makes," a hit song that 
was originally written in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 From the pre-rock era until today, Latin music has inspired a succession of 
dance crazes, from the tango and the rumba through to the more recent lambada 
and salsa. The show covers these with a quick history, then explores Cole 
Porter's fascination with the beguine rhythm from Martinique (as in "Night and 
Day"). 
</P>
<P>
 Act One also includes a section on the perpetuation of Latino stereotypes in 
popular music, including "Manana," popularized by Peggy Lee (which exemplifies 
the "lazy Mexican" stereotype, Levy said) and Pat Boone's hit "Speedy 
Gonzalez," with its shifty protagonist and the exaggerated accents of the 
backup singers. ("Rosarita come quickly, down at the Quick Stop they're giving 
Green Stamps with tequila," goes one line.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I was leery of doing it. I wasn't sure the audience would get the ironic 
distance," Levy said. But Frizler, who has explored stereotypes in popular 
music before, was all for including the songs, and they contacted a Latino 
student association on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Frey, president of Macondo, said she finds the approach educational for 
both Latinos and others alike. "It's more objective if you have both sides of 
the coin," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Act Two is heavy on Caribbean influences, starting with calypso and soca (with 
Buster Poindexter's hit remake of "Hot Hot Hot") and moving to reggae. The way 
mainstream performers incorporated these rhythms is a big part of the show: 
there's the Police ("Roxanne"), UB40 ("Red Red Wine"), Blondie ("The Tide Is 
High") and Madonna ("I'm Going Bananas"). 
</P>
<P>
 "La Bamba" is reprised for the closing number, this time as performed by Los 
Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
 The big time spread presents a challenge for performers. Kaja Holland, an 
alumnus appearing in her third production, goes from being one of the Andrews 
Sisters, to Mary Martin to Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of wigs," the brunette said. "I don't get to use my real hair at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Auditions were a monthlong process for Frizler, followed by about six weeks of 
rehearsals. Because Chapman has a strong music department, he said, he has a 
rich pool of vocal talent to draw from, but casting harmony groups such as the 
Andrews Sisters still posed a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally the outgrowth of a fraternity skit, Frizler's musical stage shows 
have over the years turned into a popular celebration of rock's history and 
byways, utilizing almost 100 singers, musicians, dancers and technical people. 
</P>
<P>
 The off-the-cuff, "let's put on a show" spirit of the early days has slowly 
given way to a more polished veneer, but the revue remains an all-volunteer 
labor of love. Many continue to take part in the show long after they leave 
school, although Vicky Miller of Orange holds a particular distinction: She's 
the only person to have appeared in all 20 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 She has watched as the semiannual event has grown in scope, gaining a "bigger 
budget, better equipment, more support from the school," she said. "It used to 
be on a wing and a prayer. Now we've even got a costume budget." 
</P>
<P>
 "I basically do it because it's fun," Miller said, and although the late-night 
rehearsals sometimes test her resolve, "Paul does inspire an incredible amount 
of loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1975 show was billed as a look back at 20 years of rock history, and 
Frizler has updated that every five years since, giving himself a crash course 
in the latest pop trends every time around (the 1990 show included performances 
of songs by such then-new artists as rappers Public Enemy and socially 
conscious folk singer Tracy Chapman). 
</P>
<P>
 In the off years, he's taken time to explore some off-center rock topics, as 
in 1992's satiric revue, "A Comical Look at Rock and Roll and Other Outrageous 
Musical Hilarities." One program explored the African American roots of rock 
'n' roll, an influence that has been much better documented than the Latin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Frizler's revue is now staged every two years, the current show marks 
both the 20th year and the 20th production. That's because, in the beginning, 
Frizler produced a show every semester, a memory that amazes him now. "I can't 
even imagine doing it every year now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said this might be his last production, partly because of all the work, 
partly because he worries about pushing his luck. Most past productions have 
sold out their entire seven-performance runs in the 950-seat hall, and Frizler 
wonders if the streak will someday desert him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've all been too successful," Frizler said. "The law of averages is going 
to catch up with me."

POPE ISSUES PLEA FOR NICARAGUA PEACE

<P>
 Pope John Paul II appealed Friday for reconciliation in Nicaragua, where the 
last remnants of Contra rebels have been fighting with the army as the country 
struggles to end decades of guerrilla warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The pontiff asked that Nicaraguans work to "consolidate the democratic process 
and bring about true conditions of peace and justice, which the people of 
Nicaragua aspire to and have a right to." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 200 rebels, the last remnants of the U.S.-backed Contra army that 
battled the leftist Sandinista government for the 1980s, have recently agreed 
to peace talks.

MISSING BOY FOUND; PARENTS ARE JAILED; LAW ENFORCEMENT: POLICE ACCUSE 
BIOLOGICAL MOTHER AND FATHER OF ABDUCTION. CHILD IS OK, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 4-year-old boy who disappeared a week ago from his foster home in Rancho 
Santa Margarita was found Friday with his biological parents, who were arrested 
on suspicion of child abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj Yaser Jayyusi was discovered by sheriff's deputies about 6:45 p.m. Friday 
in a car parked in front of a building at the corner of Studebaker Street and 
Alondra Avenue in Cerritos where his father, Yaser Majed Jayyusi, 55, had gone 
to pick up a paycheck. Also in the car was the boy's mother, Deborah Ann 
Jayyusi, 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parents were taken to the Orange County Jail, where they were being held 
charges of child abduction. Bail was set at $250,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arrest happened without incident," said Lt. Dan Martini. "We can report 
that the boy is in good health and good spirits. He was obviously a little 
shaken over the arrest situation, but he was calmed down very quickly and 
seemed to adapt to the officers at the scene. He seems to be doing very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said that the boy had been taken to Orangewood, a home in Orange for 
abused or abandoned children, and eventually would be released to the custody 
of his foster mother, Susan White, although Martini could not say exactly when 
that would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The case made headlines earlier this week when Taj disappeared from White's 
home, where he had lived since August after being removed from the custody of 
his parents two years ago. While officials would not discuss the reasons for 
the boy's removal, a court hearing to terminate their parental rights had been 
scheduled for last Wednesday and White, 43, already had begun adoption 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the parents moved from their Anaheim home about the time Taj 
disappeared and because the father is a Jordanian national, deputies initially 
feared that the boy had been taken out of the country. Those fears were eased 
somewhat when the youngster was sighted on Wednesday with the Jayyusis in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 White's friends and neighbors, who earlier in the week had crowded into her 
two-bedroom condominium with food, condolences and offers of help, reacted 
Friday with excitement to the news that boy had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 "This abduction was quite traumatic for the entire community," said Diane 
Gaynor, director of public relations for the Santa Margarita Co., which had 
aided in the search. 
</P>
<P>
 A candlelight vigil scheduled for 5 p.m. Sunday at the Santa Margarita Beach 
Club, she said, will now be turned into a celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday night, White was reported to be en route to Orangewood to retrieve 
the little boy. And even normally stoic sheriff's deputies sounded happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real happy ending before this long weekend," Martini said. "We're 
thrilled."

AGENCY FAULTS ITSELF FOR MAJOR TB OUTBREAK; HEALTH: COUNTY OFFICIALS SAY THEY 
FAILED TO PROPERLY MONITOR TUBERCULAR STUDENT WHO DEVELOPED CONTAGIOUS STRAIN 
THAT PROBABLY INFECTED 12 CLASSMATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 County health officials acknowledged Friday that they failed to adequately 
follow the treatment of an Orange County high school student with active 
tuberculosis who probably infected 12 classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said that from what they have learned from the recent TB outbreak at 
La Quinta High School, the Orange County Health Care Agency has initiated 
reforms to assure closer collaboration between the county public health office 
and private physicians and laboratories in the care of tubercular patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have instituted more aggressive systems to assure this will never happen 
again," said Penny Weismuller, the county's manager for disease control. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes come in response to recent critiques of the agency's handling of 
the La Quinta outbreak by the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta 
and the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 After the County Health Care Agency learned in June, 1992, that a student at 
Quinta High School in Westminster had tuberculosis, a county worker made 25 
unsuccessful attempts during a seven-month period to obtain information from 
the girl's physicians about the progress of her treatment, Weismuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, it was determined that the student's erratic practice of taking 
prescribedantibiotics led to her to develop a contagious, mutant form of the 
tuberculosis bacterium that was drug-resistant, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were assuming, maybe it was a false assumption, that the patient was being 
treated adequately," said Dr. Hugh Stallworth, Orange County's public health 
officer. He noted that the student was being seen by both a primary care 
physician and pulmonary specialist who had assured county officials that she 
was not contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state investigators, whom the county invited to critique their 
handling of the tuberculosis outbreak, concluded that the county should have 
been "more aggressive" in its monitoring of the initial infected student, 
Stallworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county ultimately took over the girl's treatment in June when her doctors 
were puzzled why she had a "positive" sputum culture, a sign of active 
tuberculosis, after a year of treatment, Weismuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in September the student was hospitalized because she was violating 
quarantine requirements that she stay out of public places, Weismuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of growing concern that the infected student might be spreading her 
disease, Weismuller said, county health workers last spring tested 225 of her 
La Quinta classmates, followed in the fall by a screening of the entire student 
body.  
</P>
<P>
 In all, 16 cases of active TB were discovered at La Quinta, 12 of which were 
linked to the girl. An additional 178 students were found to be infected with 
the bacteria that causes TB. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth believes that the outbreak was the largest one in an American high 
school this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Weismuller said the La Quinta case illustrates shortcomings of the private 
medical community and the county in monitoring tubercular patients. 
</P>
<P>
 She said a review of medical records shows that the student believed 
responsible for the TB outbreak at La Quinta was infectious since January, 
1991, when she went to a private doctor complaining of a cough. 
</P>
<P>
 The private physician, Weismuller said, misdiagnosed her ailment as 
bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
 The student, who wasn't getting well, went to another physician who, as early 
as January, 1991, suspected that she had tuberculosis but did not report that 
to the county until June when he received laboratory reports that confirmed his 
diagnosis.  
</P>
<P>
 "He should have reported even a suspicion of tuberculosis to us," Weismuller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth and Weismuller said they have taken steps to make certain the 
mistakes at La Quinta will not be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably could have policed the private physicians more," Stallworth said. 
Because tuberculosis had almost disappeared in the United States, and has been 
increasing only since the mid-1980s, he said, many physicians need help in 
diagnosing and treating it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What public health is being asked to do is monitor what private physicians 
are doing," Stallworth said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the problems associated with the outbreak, he said, the county 
has hired a public health nurse to work with doctors who report TB cases to the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth said the physicians will be asked to show the county the kind of 
treatment they are prescribing and will be advised if any change should be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the treatment for tuberculosis can take as long as 12 months, 
Weismuller said, it it especially important to keep tabs on patient compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very difficult for any patient to comply with a long-term course of 
therapy," she said, "and the resources available in a private physician's 
office to keep track, for instance, of broken appointments with doctors, is 
limited. So we have to work together." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Stallworth said, he has added a new position of tuberculosis 
program manager and an epidemiologist to oversee the search for people who have 
had contact with confirmed TB patients and must be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they also plan to hand-deliver letters to all local 
laboratories, asking them to report initial positive TB tests, without waiting 
for final results. Weismuller said the county will be assisted by changes in a 
state law, which became effective in January, that requires the county health 
agency's approval of the treatment plan for every TB patient.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it came out of increased concern for the rising number of TB cases 
nationwide," she said.

MAN SUES EX-WIFE, TRUE FATHER OF KIDS SHE TOLD HIM WERE HIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 For more than nine years, David Reese did all of the things that he thought a 
father should. 
</P>
<P>
 He sent the children to private schools, paid their medical bills, enrolled 
them in dance lessons and planned family vacations. And when he and his wife, 
Rebecca Reese, separated in 1992 with the intention of dissolving their 17-year 
marriage, David Reese says he paid child support and scheduled regular weekend 
visitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last year a bomb fell. In an angry telephone conversation during a 
dispute over child support, Rebecca Reese informed her ex-husband that his 
children, now ages 9 and 5, weren't biologically his. Genetic testing showed 
she was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was horrified," said Reese of Orange. "I was stunned." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more stunning though, he said, was a ruling by a Riverside County 
Superior Court judge that Reese was still their legal father with all parental 
responsibilities and obligations, including child support. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese and his lawyer have appealed that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week they went a step further. In a lawsuit filed in Santa Ana 
Superior Court, Reese, 39, accuses his ex-wife and the admitted father of her 
children of fraud, demanding reimbursement for the more than $200,000 he says 
he spent on raising the kids from birth, indemnity from all future child 
support payments and an additional $1 million each for emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 "David relied upon the representations . . . that (the children) were his 
biological children and held himself out to be their father," the suit 
maintains. "He expended time, energy, care, emotion and money on the children; 
established emotional and psychological bonds with them; and performed all acts 
that a father generally would toward children." 
</P>
<P>
 John L. Dodd, Reese's lawyer, said Rebecca Reese "essentially defrauded David 
by lying to him as to who the father of the children is. They are the (natural 
father's) children and he should be required to live up to that 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Reese, who lives in San Jacinto in Riverside County and works as a 
recreation director in a convalescent home, said of the lawsuit: "I just feel 
it's nonsense. I've been in and out of court for 18 months. This is a very 
private situation and I wish very much not to exploit my children nor the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee O'Conner, the La Habra grocery clerk named in the lawsuit as the 
children's biological father, said Friday night that he had fathered the 
children at the request of Rebecca Reese, a longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I did for them was a favor because they couldn't have any kids," said 
O'Conner, 38. "That's the extent I had to do with it. I thought (David Reese) 
knew about it all along." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging his paternity, O'Conner, who is single, said he rarely 
sees the children now and keeps in touch with their mother only intermittently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be their dad," he said. "I wasn't there while they were 
raised. I just don't feel like a father to them." 
</P>
<P>
 And while he has sympathy for the children, he says, he is in no position to 
assume financial responsibility for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately (the Reeses') relationship failed, and Dave tried to bail out 
of the situation, so I might have some problems with the lawsuit," O'Conner 
said. "It's too bad for the kids that things didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, meanwhile, said that he hasn't seen the children he said he still loves 
since last June and stopped paying child support in May after he couldn't find 
work as a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months ago, he remarried. Eventually, he would like to re-establish 
contact with the children he once thought were his, perhaps in "some kind of 
big brother or stepfather relationship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel deeply hurt," Reese said. "It was the greatest deception that ever 
was; nothing worse can happen to a man. If you can't have faith in your wife, 
what can you have faith in? It seems like our whole life was a lie."

MAHONY SUPPORTS 'DISSENTERS'; CARDINAL OPENS CHURCH CONCLAVE IN ANAHEIM; BACKS 
NUN, ORGANIZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger M. Mahony opened one of the largest religious conferences in 
the world Friday by declaring his uncompromising support for two church 
officials now under attack by conservative Catholics as "dissenters in sheep's 
clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony's backing of a leading nun in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles and a conference organizer of the annual religious event was greeted 
with a rousing ovation from an estimated 10,000 delegates during the morning's 
welcoming services at the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the three-day educational congress, more than 20,000 delegates from as far 
away as Poland and the Philippines are expected to participate in 240 
educational workshops offering a range of topics from "Understanding HIV 
Infection and AIDS" to "Getting to Know Jesus Better." 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening remarks, Mahony rose to defend Sister Edith Prendergast and 
conference coordinator Adrian Whitaker. Earlier this month, a small coalition 
of conservative Catholic groups demanded their resignations for inviting 
conference speakers who are critical of the Catholic Church and who have 
supported abortion rights as well as the ordination of women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give my categorical and uncompromising support" to the organizers, Mahony 
told the audience. "The overall good of this congress through the years is 
without question." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a dozen picketers distributed leaflets warning that the gathering 
could damage one's "spiritual health," Mahony told delegates to "smother" the 
protesters with love. The annual conference, he said, is "one of the finest 
expressions of the church." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the cardinal supported Prendergast and Whitaker, Mahony two weeks ago 
withdrew a conference invitation to Daniel Maguire, a former priest and 
abortion rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, for reasons not disclosed, the Rev. John R. Aurelio of Buffalo, N.Y., 
was taken off the list of speakers after allegations surfaced that he had 
molested two boys 15 to 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In wake of the news about Aurelio, Mahony said a system will be implemented to 
do thorough background checks of those invited to speak at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the controversy surrounding the conference organizers, delegate 
Steve Dzida, 43, who attends Sts. Simon and Jude Catholic Church in Huntington 
Beach, urged the archdiocese to continue inviting controversial and provocative 
speakers to the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are the kinds of people who are going to be able to lead us into 
the 21st Century," said Dzida, an attorney. "Putting the wraps around them is 
like trying to take us back to the Dark Ages, when we were holding Inquisitions 
and throwing Galileo in jail because he didn't accept the fact that everything 
revolved around the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Most delegates seemed unruffled by the protesters from two groups calling 
themselves Catholics United for the Splendor of Truth and the Huntington 
Beach-based JP2, after Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always someone out there promoting some cause," said Ted Shaw, a 
volunteer coordinator who has been to the last 20 religious conferences. 
"That's their right." 
</P>
<P>
 Though not familiar with the protesters outside, delegate Celeste Johnson, a 
15-year veteran of the event, said the conference should recruit more minority 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being an African American, I'd like to see a wider range of presenters," said 
Johnson, 33, a teacher at San Miguel Catholic School in the Watts section of 
Los Angeles. "This conference tends to be very white, so is the church. There's 
nothing wrong with that, we just need to broaden our appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Delegates spent most of Friday intently listening to a host of workshop 
speakers in search of new material to incorporate into their church teachings 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming to something like this is a chance to get in touch with what's 
happening in the church as a whole and not just what's going on in your own 
little corner," said Douglas Clipperton, 43, who teaches adult Catholic classes 
in Mojave. "It's a good shot in the arm." 
</P>
<P>
 For Leon Grygorczyk, a priest from Bialystok, Poland, the conference has 
already supplied him with ideas to take back to his church. "This is very 
different from Poland where in church, things are quiet," said Grygorczyk. 
"Everyone here is so involved, waving their hands, singing and dancing. It's 
very unusual to see this."

RADAR TOWER EMISSIONS CALLED SAFE AFTER TEST; OJAI VALLEY: THE DAYLONG STUDY 
FAILS TO EASE RESIDENTS' FEARS. THE RESULTS ARE CONSIDERED BELOW THE NATIONAL 
STANDARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Surrounded by detailed charts and maps, National Weather Service officials on 
Friday pointed to the results of a daylong study of energy emissions from a 
Sulphur Mountain radar tower which they say prove the weather-tracking system 
is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very confident that the microwave energy from the radar tower is way 
below the national standard," said Jim Campbell, deputy director of the 
National Weather Service's Western region. 
</P>
<P>
 Private researchers, hired by the National Weather Service, conducted six 
tests near the tower on Wednesday. Each one showed low levels of energy being 
emitted from the 98-foot radar tower, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were conducted specifically to ease local residents' fears of 
exposure to radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said the national standard for microwave emissions, set by the 
American National Standards Institute, is 1.8 milliwatts per centimeters 
squared. The highest average emission -- .0006 -- was recorded at a site on 
Sulphur Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's 10,000 times below the national standard," Campbell said, pointing to 
a graph behind him. Campbell said an emission of .0006 has the same effect as 
standing 10 feet from a microwave oven while it's on. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers tested emissions at five other sites: two others on Sulphur 
Mountain Road, one from the property where the tower stands, one from an upper 
Ojai elementary school and one from Santa Paula. Lower emissions were recorded 
at all five sites. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents said they weren't worried about an average emission. They wanted 
to know the amount of radiation emitted during peak periods. The radar's energy 
is emitted in pulses. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Martin, one of two researchers from the Illinois Institute of 
Technology Research Institute who conducted the tests, said at their highest 
point, the peaks of energy measured between .01 and .1 milliwatts per 
centimeters squared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overwhelmingly, the conclusions have been that this microwave energy emitted 
is safe for humans," Campbell said, citing airport radar towers as an example 
of a system that has shown no harmful effects. "This has been looked at for 
over 30 years, there's been something like 10,000 studies done . . . there 
would be some evidence that there is some increased risk and that hasn't been 
shown."  
</P>
<P>
 But Ojai Valley residents were not convinced by the recent test results or the 
government's claims. They stand firm in their desire to have the tower moved.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it makes a difference," Ojai Valley resident Lance Bergland 
said of the test results. "We don't believe in the standard." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Givner said the residents will continue to fight the tower's operation in 
the courtroom and in the legislature. The tower is operating at this time, 
while tests are being completed by the firm constructing 165 Doppler radar 
stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to fight this in court," Givner said. "If we had the money we'd 
do it immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 He said residents are trying to raise money to appeal a federal judge's 
decision earlier this month that allowed the government to turn on the radar 
tower. Givner estimates it could cost between $75,000 and $100,000 to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 He said they are also trying to enlist local politicians to help them in their 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) introduced legislation to two 
congressional committees asking for the tower's operation to be suspended while 
a 12-month study is conducted to look at potential heath risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were pleased by Gallegly's political move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to push very hard to get that passed," Bergland said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; FILLMORE STORES TO REOPEN IN BIG TENT; 
EMERGENCY: EX-LAKER PLAYER A.C. GREEN HELPS FUND THE PROJECT. MEANWHILE, 
INSPECTORS FIND MORE DAMAGE TO BUILDINGS.; ' WITHOUT THE TENT, A LOT OF THESE 
COMPANIES WOULD HAVE TO FOLD. ' DALE CROCKETT PRESIDENT OF THE FILLMORE CHAMBER 
OF COMMERCE

 Fillmore merchants devastated by the Jan. 17 earthquake will take a large step 
toward recovery Monday, when they resume business in a huge fabric tent near 
their damaged Central Avenue stores. 
</P>
<P>
 With financial assistance of an undisclosed amount from former Laker 
basketball player A.C. Green, the city of Fillmore has erected the 
11,000-square-foot tent in a downtown park to serve as a makeshift mini-mall 
for displaced businesses. Trailers have been installed nearby to house other 
merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be great," Dale Crockett, president of the Fillmore Chamber of 
Commerce, said Friday. Crockett's photography studio and the chamber's office 
are among the 11 Fillmore businesses that will reopen inside the tent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's been closed a month, with no cash and no cash flow," Crockett 
said. "Without the tent, a lot of these companies would have to fold." 
</P>
<P>
 While the temporary structures will help put Fillmore business owners back on 
their feet, thousands of quake victims in Fillmore and in Simi Valley are still 
staying with friends and family while waiting to repair their homes or find new 
housing, emergency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cities, inspectors continued to find more damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore inspectors have issued 329 red tags to buildings and trailers so 
heavily damaged that they are unsafe to occupy, and another 350 yellow tags to 
buildings considered risky to enter, city building official Jim Scheidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, inspectors have slapped yellow tags on 555 residences and 
businesses and 101 red tags on structures of all types. Inspectors have 
declared more than 7,500 damaged structures safe, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage in Simi Valley is estimated at more than $400 million, and many damaged 
buildings still have not been inspected, Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still a few people living in tents in the front yards of homes that 
they either cannot re-enter or (are) afraid to," Sedell said. "But by and 
large, people have put roofs over their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Just 54 people remain in an emergency shelter countywide, all at the Red Cross 
shelter at Fillmore Middle School, shelter manager John Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are slowing down, but we still have 13 families who haven't found 
housing, especially large families with eight to 10 members," Hernandez said. 
Red Cross volunteers have recruited bands and entertainers to boost sagging 
morale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten to the stage where they're very worried," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Palazuelos, a county mental health counselor, said the crowding and lack 
of privacy at the shelter have taken their toll on volunteers and earthquake 
victims alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's starting to wear on the volunteers," Palazuelos said. "Everybody's tired 
and has complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal disaster officials have spent $171 million in temporary housing 
assistance and housing repairs since the earthquake in Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties, said Russ Edmonston of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants, available without regard to financial need, help homeowners and 
renters pay for temporary housing until their residences are repaired or 
permanent housing is located. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, 147 lower-income Fillmore and Simi Valley residents have 
found permanent replacement housing in communities as far away as Ventura and 
Oxnard with federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Briggs, executive director of the Area Housing Authority of Ventura 
County, said volunteers from Fresno to San Diego have helped interview 
applicants for the aid program, which provides up to 18 months of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for every family that has found new quarters under the program, Briggs 
said, three other families with vouchers have not located new housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still holding out, doing a little house shopping, because they're 
temporarily staying with friends or relatives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to find something closer to home or want to wait until school lets 
out before moving," Briggs said. "Pretty soon they'll start looking farther 
afield."

PIRU'S DAMAGED BANK WILL NOT BE REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Piru's only bank, which has been closed since it was severely damaged in the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, will not reopen because repairs to the building are too 
costly, bank officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors of Citizen's State Bank of Santa Paula had considered 
operating from a mobile unit in Piru, but they decided against it for fear that 
such a site could be easily robbed, said bank President Joseph C. Nesbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a great relationship with the community and they have indicated that 
they need a bank, (but) the board felt that the liability may be more than they 
can handle," Nesbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, which had operated out of a 77-year-old brick building on Center 
Street since 1984, suffered extensive damage. Like many other buildings in the 
tiny rural town of nearly 1,200, the building was determined to be too 
dangerous to enter until the repairs were made. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be at least six months before the building could be repaired, Nesbitt 
said. He did not have an estimate on the cost of the repairs but said it would 
be prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the earthquake, Nesbitt said, bank officials had no intention of 
leaving the area. "We would have stayed there if it had not been for the 
earthquake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure marks the second time since the early 1980s that Piru has been 
left without a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, residents said they were disappointed and angry that now they have 
to drive either to Fillmore or Santa Paula for bank transactions, including 
withdrawing cash. 
</P>
<P>
 As it struggles to recover from the quake, Piru needs its own bank more than 
ever, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the responsibility of the bank to come out now and help us," said Patti 
Alexakis, 46, of Piru. "On top of the earthquake disaster, this is just one 
more disaster. It gives me the feeling that they (the bank) just don't care 
about us." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexakis said she plans to write a letter to the bank's board of directors 
complaining about the decision, and plans to organize a petition drive among 
residents asking the bank to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bank's board has approved the closure of the Piru branch, it 
still needs to submit a request that must be approved by the state and federal 
authorities, Nesbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Creason, president of the Fillmore-Piru Citrus Assn., said the bank 
closing would cause enormous detriment to the community. "We are just on the 
edge of redeveloping the town and the bank is a key holder of that 
development," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the association and several Piru residents were planning to build 
about 150 new houses with the bank's financial backing, but those plans must 
now be put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Creason said when the Bank of America left Piru about 15 years ago, he and 
other members of the association promised to do most of their business with 
Citizen's State Bank if the bank opened a branch in Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, Creason said, the association and the bank agreed that 
the bank would operate in a mobile unit to be located at the association's 
packing facility in Piru while the bank's building was being repaired, Creason 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Creason said he was surprised to learn about the bank board's decision and 
that he and other members of the association intend to address the bank's board 
before they submitted a closure petition to state and federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Sanchez, who owns two businesses in Piru -- Jim 's Video and Sanchez 
Grocery and Liquor -- said that since the earthquake when the bank closed, he 
has had to make two trips to Fillmore for banking transactions.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people depend on me to cash checks," Sanchez said referring to 
citrus workers who do not have a bank account. Since the quake, he said, many 
people have gone weeks without cashing their paychecks because he has 
discontinued the cashing service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be on the road from Fillmore to Piru with a lot of cash," 
Sanchez said. "That is dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Polly Bee, a Ventura County employee who has been helping residents in 
Fillmore rebuild their lives since the quake, said the lack of a bank in Piru 
will affect mostly the city's large elderly community, many of whom do not 
drive.  
</P>
<P>
 "The community has been knocked down with the earthquake and now they are 
getting a punch on the stomach," Bee said. "The community looks up to them (the 
bank) for support." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Bourne, manager of Citizen's State Bank's Fillmore branch, said many 
customers from Piru have been doing business in the Fillmore branch, which was 
barely affected by the earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 But driving eight miles to Fillmore just to cash a check is inconvenient to 
many residents, said Al Gaitan, president of the Piru Neighborhood Council. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, losing their bank is probably the most demoralizing 
event for Piru's residents, said Alexakis. "Not having a bank to call your own 
is discouraging."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; COALITION FORMED TO ATTRACT L.A. BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Insisting that they only want to be good neighbors, Ventura County business 
and government leaders have set up a coalition to attract quake-ravaged San 
Fernando Valley businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Wednesday, the newly formed Partners in Action coalition will offer a 
toll-free telephone line, a fast-track permit process and other relocation 
assistance to Los Angeles County businesses considering a temporary or 
permanent move to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to send the message that we want to keep you in Southern California 
and we want to be good neighbors," coalition spokeswoman Dana Weber Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley business boosters, however, did not take the offer so genially. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these are my neighbors, God forbid what my enemies might do," said Ben 
Reznik, chairman of the Earthquake Recovery Task Force for the Valley Industry 
and Commerce Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're thinking very selfishly," said Reznik, a Sherman Oaks lawyer. "If 
they were thinking about the region, they wouldn't be doing this."  
</P>
<P>
 Some Valley business owners said by attempting to attract businesses -- even 
temporarily -- to Ventura County, the coalition puts the entire Valley economy 
at risk.  
</P>
<P>
 "When businesses move out, it also affects the restaurants employees eat in 
and the stores they shop in," said Joe Kletzel, president of Chatsworth-based 
Devon Industries and a member of VICA. "It will destroy the economic base of 
the Valley."  
</P>
<P>
 Young disputed such talk, saying she doubts desirable commercial rental space 
can be found in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not aimed at stealing businesses," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition plans to spend about $30,000 on promotion and assistance, 
running ads in San Fernando Valley newspapers and on Valley radio stations and 
staffing the toll-free telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members promise that one phone call will be all a business needs to 
get industrial, commercial and residential rental information as well as advice 
on what local city best fits the company's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition includes local chambers of commerce, county government, real 
estate firms, and individual businessmen and businesswomen. Young said although 
only a few cities have so far agreed to join the coalition and donate money 
toward its marketing effort, many others have expressed interest in 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Ventura and Oxnard have each donated $2,500. The Thousand Oaks 
City Council will discuss donating $2,500 to the effort at its council meeting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hayes, economic redevelopment manager for the city of Moorpark, said 
Moorpark is ready to help ease a company's relocation from the Valley. The 
Moorpark City Council has not yet discussed participating in the coalition, he 
said 
</P>
<P>
 "Any Valley business that comes through will receive immediate, special 
attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition's telephone number, which will be in effect Wednesday and 
operating out of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn.'s office in 
Oxnard, is 1-800-880-3700 or 805-988-1106.

200 SUPPORT GALLEGLY ON HEALTH RULES; POLITICS: CONGRESSMAN CO-AUTHORED A BILL 
TO PREVENT THE FDA FROM ISSUING NEW REGULATIONS ON DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health activists and local residents packed a hearing conducted by Rep. Elton 
Gallegly in Ventura on Friday to oppose new regulations on dietary supplements 
and vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Republican is the co-author of pending legislation to head off 
the new rules, which are scheduled to go into effect in July. Opponents of the 
regulations say they would restrict the availability of supplements and in some 
cases eliminate them from the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Food and Drug Administration, which developed the rules, contends 
that they will only ensure that the labeling on supplements is truthful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rhetoric that the FDA plans on banning any supplements or requiring 
prescriptions for vitamins just isn't true," said Mitchell Zeller, an FDA 
spokesman who attended the hearing. "This is a truth-in-labeling issue. We want 
to protect the consumer from unsubstantiated claims." 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA has said that health claims for vitamins, minerals, herbs and other 
supplements will be subjected to the same requirements that currently apply to 
most foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agency's proposal, any claim touting the health benefits of a 
vitamin or supplement must be substantiated by "significant scientific 
agreement among qualified experts." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, held in the Reagan Room at the Ventura Holiday Inn, Zeller was 
almost alone in supporting the rules. Members of the 200-strong audience often 
broke in with objections to his assertions that the regulations would not hurt 
the $4-billion health-supplement industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me decide what goes in my body," a man in the audience yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can see, this is an emotional issue," Gallegly said during the 
intermission. "This really has to do with government regulation and the 
government saying they know better." 
</P>
<P>
 Other panelists gathered by Gallegly and a panel of doctors who practice 
alternative medicine in Southern California wowed the crowd with their claims 
of the benefits of nutritional supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Joan Priestly said the 700 AIDS patients she is treating with supplements 
are healthier than those treated with conventional drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard these kind of claims before," said John Gleason, a senior staff 
attorney for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Gleason was the 
only person to speak in support of the FDA rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those claims lure people into treatment or into purchasing supplements, and 
they're not substantiated," Gleason said. "The new rules are to ensure that 
people get accurate information."  
</P>
<P>
 Priestly said she could substantiate her claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-supplement supporters contend that information from studies such as 
Priestly's would be suppressed by the FDA. Gleason conceded that the 
regulations would prevent health stores from giving out information on vitamins 
and minerals that contains unsubstantiated health claims, even if the 
information was clipped from articles and independent reports. 
</P>
<P>
 This was particularly objectionable to supporters of the 
nutritional-supplement industry who spoke Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a moral obligation to disseminate information that will help my fellow 
citizens," said Dr. Julian Whitaker, president of the American Preventive 
Medical Assn., which is working against regulations on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not abide by the FDA's regime of censorship," Whitaker added. He then 
reached for a canister of vitamins labeled with the claims that Vitamin B 
prevents spina bifida and that Vitamin C may reduce the risk of heart disease 
and some forms of cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 Holding it aloft along with an inch-thick binder of articles on the benefits 
of supplements, Whitaker said: "Does anyone want to buy these truthfully 
labeled nutritional supplements?" 
</P>
<P>
 He sold three canisters amid a din of applause before Gallegly brought the 
hearing back to order.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; RED CROSS SALUTES ITS MAJOR DONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Red Cross officials rolled out the red carpet Thursday night for 
companies and individuals who assisted in local disaster relief, including 
donations for last fall's Laguna Beach firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross collected nearly $700,000 to help fire victims and more than 
$500,000 worth of goods including shovels, gloves, food, clothes, sheets, even 
800 cameras for documenting fire damage, Red Cross spokeswoman Judy Iannaccone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the fire our back parking lot here was like Grand Central Station. We 
had one semi-tractor trailer showing up after another," she said. "We're very, 
very fortunate and glad that these corporations have come forward . . . but we 
need this support on an annual basis." 
</P>
<P>
 During an awards ceremony at the Red Cross office in Santa Ana, Red Cross 
officials honored representatives of 160 corporations and 135 individuals. 
Donors included the L.A. Kings, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, FHP Healthcare, 
Kaiser Permanente and Auto Trader magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Those being honored received plaques and chatted with volunteers. In addition 
to the fire relief money, the Irvine Co. and nine other corporations donated 
money to help the Red Cross meet a matching grant of $400,000 from an anonymous 
donor for general operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster preparedness is still on the minds of many Laguna Beach residents. 
Jill Brandenburger, Red Cross Laguna Beach outreach coordinator, said she 
handed out hundreds of disaster guideline pamphlets this week as rain pelted 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandenburger will offer a free introduction to disaster services March 16 
from 7 to 10 p.m. on the third floor of the Wells Fargo Bank Building, 260 
Ocean Ave. To register, call (714) 835-5381, Ext. 140.MARY LOU PICKEL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; TV NEWS SHOW CAN STAY IN CLASSROOMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Children at Isbell Middle School in Santa Paula will continue to watch a 
commercial television news program in the classroom after the district's 
governing board backed away from a proposal to end the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Elementary School District's board of trustees decided not to 
terminate its contract with the company that offers the program called Channel 
One despite objections to advertising that was broadcast with the 15-minute 
news programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at the cash-strapped school said the benefits of the programming far 
outweigh the two minutes per day of flashy advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the agreement with Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle Communications, 
the company provides classrooms with $60,000 worth of equipment, including 
television sets for each classroom, a satellite dish and two video cassette 
recorders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine going back," said Mary Stillman, who teaches eighth grade at 
the school. "It would be crazy to give up all that equipment. I'm remembering 
how I had to carry my TV and VCR from home whenever I wanted to show an 
educational tape." 
</P>
<P>
 The board signed an agreement with Whittle Communications almost three years 
ago and at the time was one of just a handful of schools in California 
subscribing to the service. Nearly 100 public schools in California now 
broadcast Channel One in the classroom, and about 12,000 schools nationwide 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittle reportedly receives about $156,000 for each 30-second commercial, and 
was projected to gross approximately $90 million from the service last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Teachers Assn. has been a strong opponent of allowing 
commercial television into public schools, but no teachers spoke against it at 
the board meeting Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 School board trustee Gene Marzec who pushed to end the contract, echoed 
concerns of the association at the meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 "We already know kids watch too much TV," he said. "We know the parents are 
probably telling them to turn it off and go do their homework, and then they 
come into school and the first thing they do is sit down and watch TV." SCOTT

 The Mighty Ducks' one-day tickets-for-guns exchange will be held today from 10 
a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Anaheim Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange specifically targets handguns, but "if someone comes in with a 
bazooka, we'll probably figure something out," said Bill Robertson, spokesman 
for the hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone turning in a firearm will receive two tickets to one of the Ducks' 
remaining home games this season. Depending on how many people take the team up 
on the offer, though, some pairs of seats may not be together. Many of the 
Ducks' remaining games are almost sold out, with only single seats available, 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope it's a big success, but there's no way to gauge it at this point," he 
said. "But our feeling is any handguns that are brought in mean that many more 
off the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange will be held just outside the entrance to the department, at 425 
S. Harbor Blvd.REBECCA TROUNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; FAIR WILL BID GOODBY TO BUFFALO RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're calling this weekend's public celebration at the Buffalo Ranch "the 
last roundup." 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists say the name aptly describes the precarious state of the 
landmark ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The last of the business tenants that rented space on the ranch left this 
month. And the Irvine Co., which owns the site, is talking with the Orange 
County Fair about moving all or some of the ranch's more than a dozen buildings 
to the Costa Mesa fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch has a colorful past that includes being home to an amusement park in 
the 1950s and the headquarters for the architects who designed parts of Irvine 
in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this backdrop, one of the Buffalo Ranch's oldest tenants, Lange 
Financial Corp., plans a family celebration at the site today and Sunday. The 
event will include food, music, hot-air balloon rides, pony rides, a petting 
zoo and other activities. On Sunday, some bison that have grazed on the ranch 
since the mid-1980s will be auctioned off. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Lange said sponsoring the event is a way to bid farewell to a 
property beloved not just by company employees but by residents in the 
surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to say goodby," said Shelia Starnes of Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. said the best way to preserve the ranch buildings is to move 
them to a place where they can be used productively. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Fair proposed using the buildings as classrooms and meeting halls 
at the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said one of the reasons the Irvine Co. decided to clear out all 
tenants from the ranch is that the coming realignment of Ford Road will reduce 
vehicle access to the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The company hopes to eventually build homes on the ranch, situated at the 
corner of Ford Road and MacArthur Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists working to have the spot listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places said they would prefer to have the structures remain intact at 
their current spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last roundup" takes place today and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Admission is $10 for adults and $5 for children.SHELBY GRAD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; REFRIGERATED WAREHOUSE AT DOCK 
DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the din and clatter of a bustling Port of Hueneme as a backdrop, state 
and local business and political leaders formally dedicated the port's massive 
refrigerated warehouse Friday, with toasts of the Scandinavian aperitif aquavit 
and California wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Built by the port and Cool Carriers -- the giant Scandinavian shipping line -- 
the 140,559-square-foot warehouse was designed to refrigerate citrus from the 
Sunkist Growers Assn. that is awaiting export overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 The warehouse, cooled with a cold-brine refrigeration system with the power of 
100,000 kitchen refrigerators, covers an area the size of three football 
fields. Officials with Cool Carriers say it is the largest refrigerated 
warehouse on any dock in North or South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at the port aboard historic rail cars from the Fillmore Short Line 
were dignitaries that included Cool Carriers President Bo Natt och Dag, Rep. 
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), California Secretary of Agriculture Henry Voss 
and Sunkist Growers President Russ Hanlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony J. Taormina, executive director of the Oxnard Harbor District that 
operates the port, said the warehouse would help increase agricultural business 
at "the port that farmers built." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly summed up the benefits of the new facility with three words: "Jobs, 
jobs, jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside part of the warehouse that had been converted into a banquet hall for 
the dedication, guests spoke about the economic advantages of the $10-million 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Leavens, whose family grows more than 900 acres of lemons, oranges and 
grapefruit, called the refrigerated facility "a real leg up for us." 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a great asset to growers," Leavens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of the facility should also help the Port of Hueneme gain 
visibility among area exporters, said Viola M. Koch of VK International 
Consultants of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may make a difference," Koch said. "It will give people an idea to 
export who have never exported before." PATRICK McCARTNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ILLEGALLY PREPARED FOOD TARGET OF PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county soon will crack down on illegally prepared food sold door-to-door, 
from the back of cars and in ethnic markets and other locations, a public 
health official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Merryman, director of the environmental health division of the 
county Health Care Agency, said his office has noticed an increase in illegally 
prepared and packaged foods in the past four years and is sending out a final 
warning before going after violators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting ready to crack down, but before we do this, we want to reach 
out to the general public," Merryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few weeks, his office has distributed flyers in Spanish, Chinese, 
Vietnamese, Korean and English to various ethnic markets in the county warning 
consumers and grocers to be suspicious of foods that do not appear to be 
properly packaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Merryman said his office has received several complaints about door-to-door 
food vendors and food businesses operating out of private homes. But he has 
received no complaints of illness. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental health division has routinely found full-scale manufacturing 
operations in garages, back yards and homes, Merryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that food sold to the public be prepared and stored in a 
licensed and inspected facility. Those who prepare food in their homes are 
guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and or six months 
in jail.MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; ARTWORK HONORS LEE, GOLD MEDALIST DIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As artist Robert B. Krantz on Friday unveiled a three-foot-tall bronze artwork 
honoring Dr. Sammy Lee, the first Korean American to win a gold medal in the 
Olympics, Krantz offered an anecdote from Lee's coaching days. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as a great but insistent diving teacher, Lee trained two-time Olympic 
gold-medal winners Bob Webster and Greg Louganis. He won a gold medal and a 
bronze medal in the 1948 Olympics in London and a gold in the 1952 Helsinki 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
 But Krantz' story at a Rotary Club luncheon at the Hotel Laguna had to do with 
a young diver. 
</P>
<P>
 "The diver was not getting off the board as high as Lee wanted her to," Krantz 
said. "And, Lee had this stick, a long pointer. No whip. He held it up, about 
three feet above his head, saying to her, 'I want you to get that high off the 
board.' She looked at him and said, 'I can't go up that high.' But Lee was 
insistent. He looked at her and firmly said, 'I didn't ask for your opinion.' 
Well, the diver cleared the mark." 
</P>
<P>
 As Lee was introduced to the Rotarians, the diminutive, five-foot-tall coach 
told them: "Krantz didn't tell you I stood on a box when I held that stick up." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's self-deprecating style of humor always seems to catch audiences off 
guard. It belies a man whose accomplishments include becoming a U.S. Army 
major, a physician, Olympic diver, and diving for the U.S. Olympic diving team. 
Now retired as an ear surgeon and living in Huntington Harbour, the 73-year-old 
dynamo has not lost anything growing older. 
</P>
<P>
 He still, on occasion, helps train a group of high school-level and younger 
divers at the Mission Viejo Recreation Center's Olympic diving complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee doesn't sway from debate on the center's future which is in question due 
to funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame if we lose that training facility because it has produced more 
gold medal Olympic winners in swimming and diving than anywhere else in the 
United States," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Krantz said it was this energy, Lee's motivation for trying to get the maximum 
from everyone he trained, condensed and put in visual form in the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 The artwork, commissioned by the Laguna Beach-based Kalos Kagathos Foundation, 
is a three-piece representational bronze that has a world globe at its base, 
with two hands emanating and supporting two statuesque divers of both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Hopping, Kalos foundation chairman, said the artwork will be known as 
the Sammy Lee Award, which is selected by the World Diving Coaches Assn., every 
four years as the most prestigious award in competitive diving. 
</P>
<P>
 The artwork will be displayed at the International Swimming Hall of Fame 
Museum at Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Hopping said.DAVID REYES

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; YOUTH PLEADS GUILTY IN RACIAL INCIDENT

<P>
 An 18-year-old Ventura gang member whom prosecutors describe as a white 
supremacist pleaded guilty Friday to making racial threats against a black 
Ventura High School security guard during a Jan. 26 basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Cecil Lassiter will be sentenced March 21 in Ventura County Superior 
Court on one count of threatening a school employee.Prosecutors dismissed a 
charge against him of disturbing the peace at a school. 
</P>
<P>
 Lassiter had been held in the Ventura County Jail in lieu of a $5,000 bail 
since the basketball game incident, in which he threatened to get a gun and 
shoot a school security guard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard was trying to escort Lassiter and some of his friends away from the 
gymnasium, where the suspects had surrounded two 16-year-old black students and 
yelled racial epithets at them, Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary K. Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett said the district attorney's office will recommend probation for 
Lassiter. "The conduct, just by itself, isn't worth a trip to prison in our 
view," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lassiter told the judge that he is unemployed and a member of a gang that 
frequents the Ventura Avenue area, but denied being a white supremacist. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Bruce A. Clark also agreed to allow Lassiter to be released on his own 
recognizance on the condition that he not come within 100 feet of Ventura High 
School and not associate with fellow gang members. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MOM GETS PROBATION IN CHILD-STEALING CASE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura mother of two who fled to Paris rather than give up her children was 
granted probation Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A probation report and a prosecutor had recommended a one-year jail term for 
32-year-old Nikki Lynn Ruberoe. 
</P>
<P>
 But Superior Court Judge James McNally cited Ruberoe's lack of criminal 
history and the fact that the defendant returned the children safely to their 
father, who is the custodial parent. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge suspended a six-month prison term. Ruberoe had pleaded guilty to 
child stealing, violating a custody agreement, conspiracy and helping her 
fugitive husband flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
 She was granted temporary custody of her two children last summer. But when 
her current husband was convicted of multiple counts of child molestation, she 
took the children out of the country rather than return them to their 
biological father. 
</P>
<P>
 She later admitted to taking the children, ages 10 and 13, to France and then 
arranging for their return after authorities began looking for them. She was 
arrested last September in Sri Lanka, where she had gone to meet her fugitive 
husband, 28-year-old Channa Ruberoe, a Sri Lankan national. Ventura County 
authorities are trying to extradite the husband to sentence him on child 
molestation charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think on some level, the defendant loves her children, but she puts herself 
first," Deputy Dist. Atty. Mandee Sanderson told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nikki Ruberoe's attorney, Steve Pell, said his client was negatively 
influenced by her husband, whom Pell termed "a bum, a flim-flam artist." DWAYNE

 City Clerk Elaine M. Capps gets to use the letters CMC behind her name. 
</P>
<P>
 She said being awarded the prestigious designation Certified Municipal Clerk 
brings more credibility and respect among professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The award also gives the city a boost of prestige at a time when it is needed, 
city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 As City Council and staff members have been dealing with controversy over 
redevelopment projects and lawsuits regarding eminent domain over the past 
three years, Capps has been taking classes on improving her job performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Her new title makes her one of only 203 city clerks in California who are 
certified, said Sheri Burdick, spokeswoman for the International Institute of 
Municipal Clerks, the association which awards the designation. There are more 
than 800 city clerks in the state, Burdick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capps, a resident of Brea since 1964, was elected in 1992. She served as the 
city's deputy city clerk for two years before her election. She was hired by 
the city in 1975 as previously worked as a clerk in the community services, 
finance, development and research departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Capps is responsible for preparing City Council agendas and answering public 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 She handles about 100 phone calls a day from people who seek information about 
the city, including questions about legislators, the city codes, the location 
of the dump and the deadline to file papers to run for election for the 
council, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like it a lot," said Capps, a grandmother of eight. "I have a lot of 
public contact because this is a very special city. People are really 
interested in what's happening here." 
</P>
<P>
 Burdick said the certification program began in 1970 in an effort to 
"professionalize the city clerk position." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; SINGER-DANCER DOING TIME AS UNDERSTUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What would an 18-year-old runner-up in the Miss La Palma Pageant do in 
mid-town Manhattan for the first time? 
</P>
<P>
 If you are Roxanne Taga, you land a role in the Broadway production of "Miss 
Saigon," move into a studio apartment near Times Square and delay your entrance 
into college by a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer and dancer has spent the past six months living alone and 
performing nightly shows on the Broadway stage. 
</P>
<P>
 She plays a non-speaking part as a prostitute for now, but is also the 
understudy to the title role of Kim, a Vietnamese woman who becomes "Miss 
Saigon" and falls in love with a U.S. soldier during wartime. 
</P>
<P>
 Taga hopes to follow in the footsteps of two other actresses of Filipino 
descent -- Tony award-winning Lea Salonga and Leila Florentino -- who have 
portrayed the role of Kim to critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Taga was given an official city proclamation from the mayor and 
City Council of La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 Taga took to the stage for the first time after only one audition and one 
intense week of rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very nervous knowing that I was on Broadway," she said Friday while on 
a one-week vacation to visit her parents and two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The nervousness and novelty has worn off, and performing on Broadway is like 
any other job, she said: "I do my best every night, even when I am sick. I am 
not a rich superstar." 
</P>
<P>
 Her good fortune is no fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been dancing and singing since she was 4, and has compiled a long list 
of accolades: student body president, homecoming queen, Kennedy High's best 
singer three years straight, a finalist on television's "Star Search Junior," 
and an appearance on "Punky Brewster," not to mention a host of roles in Orange 
County stage performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been involved in dancing my whole life. I have always been in the 
spotlight," she said. "If my parents didn't push me, I would not be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Ernest Taga, 53, went to New York with her last summer to help her 
find a place to live after she signed a contract to join the ensemble cast of 
"Miss Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
 He was shocked to see his daughter appear on stage scantily clad. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would only say that the show was good," she said, adding that he declined 
to critique his daughter's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that, Roxanne's father and mother, Roxanna, are proud of their 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went out there with her to New York for a month. I observed her very 
closely, and she never showed any signs of being lonely," Ernest Taga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxanne Taga is planning to visit with friends this weekend before flying back 
to New York on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very lucky to be in the situation I am now," she said. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; ALL PATROL CARS WILL GET VIDEO CAMERAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About a third of the city's police patrol cars have been fitted with video 
cameras, and by the first week of August all will carry the recording devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last week, a technician from Crimtech Systems Inc. has been installing 
the video cameras, according to Lt. Houston Williams. So far, six patrol cars 
have been fitted with the device, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a psychological boost to both police officers and citizens," 
Williams said. "People are generally on their best behavior when they know they 
are being taped. It works both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the City Council authorized spending $100,000 from the city's 
forfeiture asset fund, money generally derived from drug cases, to buy and 
install the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason was to protect the patrol officers. Council members said 
they are concerned with the increasing number of assaults against police 
officers, among them the recent killing of a Manhattan Beach police officer who 
was shot to death by an unidentified man during a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The video cameras could help prevent such assaults or at least provide 
evidence that could help identify the assailants, said Mayor Jim Potts, who 
pushed for the purchase of the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 When the installations are complete, Tustin will be the first Orange County 
city to equip all its patrol cars with video cameras, Williams said. The Orange 
County Sheriff's Department has video cameras on all patrol cars, he noted. Los 
Alamitos has cameras on some of its patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Brown, a technician from Crimtech System Inc., the Michigan-based 
company that provided the video cameras, said that several other police 
agencies, including Buena Park and Fountain Valley, have requested 
demonstrations of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's valuable in a lot of ways, including as a training tool," said Brown, 
whose job includes teaching police officers how to operate the system. "They 
could review the tapes to check if proper procedures were followed" during 
traffic stops, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Each system costs $4,500. It consists of the video camera, a computer trunk 
box that houses a computer and a videocassette recorder, a three-inch color 
monitor and a control panel that allows the officer to start or stop recording 
and to operate the camera's zoom lens. A wireless microphone that could be 
attached to the officer's lapel provides the sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that the videotape is tamper-proof and cannot be edited or erased 
because of built-in safeguards in the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It provides unbiased evidence," said Officer Pat Welch. "From that standpoint 
alone, it's a major benefit to police officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said that three patrol cars had used video cameras before the council 
decided to install them in all unit. Officers at first were reluctant to use 
them but have come to like them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, for instance, Williams said, officers stopped a motorist who ran 
three red lights and made an illegal turn. The motorist argued that he had not 
made any traffic violation. "But when the officers told him that the entire 
incident was on tape, he could only say, 'Oh,' " Williams said. "Complaints 
have been reduced substantially when the cameras were used." BERT ELJERA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; FINAL TOUCHES FOR 6.5-MILE BICYCLE 
TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Work crews are expected to paint the last few stripes on fresh blacktop along 
the Arroyo Simi next week, opening a 6.5-mile bike trail that stretches from 
one end of the city almost to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District has been working since summer to 
pave and improve nearly two miles of trail along the drainage canal at the base 
of Sequoia Street and Tapo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews finished installing fences, gates and sign posts along the two-mile 
segment this week, said Jerry Gladden, parks district director. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the path is open, bicyclists will be able to ride all the way from Madera 
Road on the trail's western end to the Metrolink station on Los Angeles Avenue 
at the eastern end. 
</P>
<P>
 That is good news to some cyclists who had to rattle and clatter over rough 
dirt and gravel on the unfinished portions in the middle part of the trail 
before they were done, said Al Bandel, a spokesman for the Rocky Peak Mountain 
Bike Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had a mountain bike, it was not a problem" Bandel said Friday. "But 
10-speeds were not made for that. . . . Each section they open is very 
helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks officials said plans are being drawn for improving the final 2,200-foot 
segment of the trail that extends west from Madera Road west toward Moorpark.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; TRIBE POSTPONES RECOMMENDATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Native American tribal leaders said Thursday that they won't make 
recommendations for the disposition of what they believe to be remains of 
ancestors buried in the Bolsa Chica Wetlands until an investigation into an 
alleged death threat to an archeologist is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal leaders said this week that they are not involved in the recent threat 
reported by archeologist Nancy Whitney-Desautels, who unearthed what some 
believe to be ancient Native American bones in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 One leader said that the FBI had contacted him and told him agents would be 
questioning Native Americans concerning the threat allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI Agent Gary Morley would not confirm or deny the existence of an 
investigation Friday, but he did say he was familiar with the threat report. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll Real Estate Group plans to build more than 4,000 homes in the area. The 
controversy about ancient remains in Bolsa Chica began last month, when 
opponents of the project leaked to the press an internal memo written by a 
forensic anthropologist hired by the Orange County coroner's office to examine 
bones found at the site in 1992. In the memo, the bones were described as "very 
old, approximately 8,000 years." Some of the bones were of human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Project opponents were angered that no mention of the 1992 find was made in 
the county's draft environmental impact report on the project, released late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Native American leaders met with representatives of the Native 
American Heritage Commission, a state body that oversees matters dealing with 
Native Americans. One representative of the developer also attended the meeting 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabrieleno Shoshone Chief Vera Rocha said Native Americans are being singled 
out in the death threat matter and that she won't participate in any 
recommendations process until their names are cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Velasques, another Gabrieleno Shoshone chief, said in an interview this 
week that an FBI agent had contacted him and told him that the agency is 
planning to investigate the death threat report and that Native Americans are 
on the list to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Dunn, senior vice president of the Koll Real Estate Group, said 
Thursday's decision by Native American leaders to delay burial recommendations 
will have no effect on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said she was told by consultant Darlene Shelley, who attended the 
meeting, that Native Americans said they trusted the company and 
Whitney-Desautels to take good care of the remains until reburial with 
appropriate religious ceremony.ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; RECALL EFFORT FACES PETITION DEADLINE 
</P>

<P>
 Organizers have three days left to gather signatures to force Mayor Charles V. 
Smith and three other City Council members to face a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be out there in the rain," Rebecca Danna, one of the leaders of the 
recall drive, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than three months of circulating the recall petitions, Danna said, 
"we feel we have enough (signatures). But we will work until the deadline just 
to make sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Recall proponents have until 5 p.m. Monday to gather 6,938 signatures to 
qualify for the ballot, according to City Clerk Mary Lou Morey. The original 
deadline, today, was changed because it falls on a Saturday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morey said she will count the signatures once the petitions are submitted to 
ensure the required number was gathered, then turn them over to the county 
Registrar of Voters, for verification that the names are of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a sufficient number of verified signatures, a recall election will 
be held in 88 to 125 days, Morey said. Should a majority of the council members 
be recalled, there would be a special election to replace them in the next 114 
to 129 days, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the cost of an extra election to remove Smith and council 
members Craig Schweisinger, Charmayne S. Bohman and Tony Lam would be about 
$150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort was prompted by last year's $1-million cut in the Fire 
Department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the firefighters union, who are supporting the recall, said the 
council put public safety in jeopardy. BERT ELJERA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITIZENS WILL JOIN HOUSING ISSUES 
PANEL

<P>
 Thousand Oaks' housing issues committee will expand its roster next month to 
include citizens as well as council members and planning commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the panel has invited residents to apply for five at-large 
seats.Applications, available in the city clerk's office, are due March 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaired by Mayor Elois Zeanah, the committee examines housing issues in 
Thousand Oaks, focusing on the best ways to provide low-cost housing and help 
first-time buyers. Other committee members are Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski and 
planning commissioners Merv Kopp and Linda Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants should have backgrounds in real estate, social services or urban 
planning as well as a general interest in neighborhoods and housing issues, 
Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had very little citizen input -- that's what seems to be missing in 
the equation," Zukowski said. "We need people who can keep a balanced 
perspective, (looking at) not just profitability of developments but also 
livability." 
</P>
<P>
 The term for the citizen members has not yet been decided, City Clerk Nancy 
Dillon said. STEPHANIE SIMON

 A 13-year-old Simi Valley boy charged with fatally stabbing one of his Valley 
View Junior High School classmates pleaded not guilty in Ventura County 
Superior Court on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Steven Z. Perren set an April 18 trial for Phillip Hernandez, who will 
not be tried as an adult because he is under 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip is charged with a single count of murder in the Feb. 1 death of 
14-year-old Chad Patrick Hubbard, a popular student and member of the school 
baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students have said the two boys had a running feud that escalated a week 
before the stabbing when Hernandez took Chad's baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen of Chad's relatives and friends appeared at Friday's 
arraignment. Phillip's mother, grandmother and an aunt were also present in 
court. Both families declined to comment afterward. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PLAN FOR 50-FOOT-TALL AMGEN LAB 
REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Planning Commission, seeking to uphold strict city limits on 
building height, rejected Amgen's request Friday to build a 50-foot-tall 
research facility in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The biotechnology firm had proposed building a 247,000-square-foot laboratory 
with underground parking at Hillcrest Drive and Rancho Conejo Boulevard as part 
of a planned decades-long expansion program. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hastily scheduled meeting that started Thursday evening and stretched 
past 1 a.m. Friday, the Planning Commission rejected the building because it 
exceeds the city's 35-foot height limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen officials argued that the extra height was necessary because the 
building contains elaborate laboratories that require space for special heating 
and cooling ducts and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see the (building's highest point) if you're on the Borchard Road 
overpass or on top of a hill in Lynn Ranch," said Ed Bjurstrom, the company's 
director of engineering and construction. "But it won't be obtrusive." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the height, commissioners expressed concern that the proposed 
research building would crowd nearby streets. Amgen had asked for waivers of 
the city's standard requirements that buildings be set back a certain distance 
from the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council made it clear that they want exceptions made for this community 
resource, which is providing jobs," Commissioner Marilyn Carpenter said. Yet 
she added that the height and setback waivers Amgen requested seemed too 
drastic. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came just days after the Planning Commission approved other 
aspects of Amgen's plan, including closing a section of Camino Dos Rios to 
create an insulated corporate campus. The City Council will review the entire 
expansion plan, including the street closure and the 50-foot research facility, 
on March 1. STEPHANIE SIMON

UCI PROPOSALS PROMPT STRONG REACTIONS; EDUCATION: PROFESSORS AND STAFF MEMBERS 
WHOSE PROGRAMS WOULD BE CUT PROTEST. THE LEADER OF ONE BUDGET PANEL SAYS HE HAS 
RECEIVED SUPPORTIVE CALLS. 
</P>

<P>
 UC Irvine professors who face elimination of their programs registered strong 
reactions Friday to the university's proposed budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Across campus, heads of departments with courses of study on the chopping 
block questioned whether the proposals would save much money and asserted that 
the budget cuts would come at the expense of students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the recommendations) show a great ignorance," said Juan Bruce-Novoa, 
who heads the Spanish department, which may be merged with two unrelated Latin 
studies programs. "I don't think the people who wrote this report really 
understand the fields they are talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dennis Aigner, dean of UCI's Graduate School of Management, said all 
departments must try to save money in the financial crisis and that he welcomed 
the challenge of making sure his school survives despite the economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, two university task forces issued a series of sweeping 
recommendations to help reduce the 1994-95 budget by an estimated $4 million. 
The dozens of proposals include eliminating UCI's teacher credentialing 
program, its comparative cultural and physical education programs and reducing 
the number of vice chancellors by half. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI has lost about $35 million in permanent state funding since 1990. Since 
then, university officials have made administrative cuts, used reserve funds, 
reduced salaries, increased student fees and offered early retirements to 
faculty and staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks ahead, five elected committees will evaluate the task force 
recommendations. These will ultimately be rejected or accepted by Chancellor 
Laurel Wilkening on or before April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 At the UCI department of education, Chairman Alan Hoffer said the programs 
selected for elimination were hit hard because they had no faculty 
representatives on the task forces. The committees recommend that Hoffer's 
teacher credentialing program be transferred to the California State University 
system, which is separate from the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took down some of the (departments) they could attack," Hoffer said, 
adding that the recommendations to cut academic departments were "ludicrous." 
The proposals will not result in saving that much money anyway, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Also recommended for closure is the physical education department, which has 
served an estimated 6,700 students over the last three quarters. P.E. classes 
are so popular that they are running at or near capacity, and there have been 
waiting lists with over 3,000 students on them, according to department 
Chairman Timothy Tift. 
</P>
<P>
 "The student population will be the losers of an opportunity to take part in 
the program," Tift said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many academics were quick to criticize the recommendations, earth 
system science professor Ralph Cicerone, leader of the task force that proposed 
academic cuts, said he received many positive calls of support on Friday from 
the faculty and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't usually hear from the negative ones," Cicerone said. "I'm not 
supposed to be advancing or defending these reports. We (did) the first step, 
and I think we did it well." 
</P>
<P>
 "We all take our share" of the cuts, said Aigner, of the Graduate Management 
School. "I saw it coming. We positioned ourselves well. I'm happy to get on 
with growing on our own without any increase in state money." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force recommended that the management school be privatized, although 
it would be allowed to retain its present enrollment, with any future expansion 
to be paid for through agreements with private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the academic proposals, the recommendations also call for some student 
services and administrative positions to be scaled back. One proposal would cut 
health services and require students to pay for their medical care out of 
pocket instead of through insurance from the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dorcas Eaves, director of Student Health Services, acknowledged that UCI 
needs to make some changes, but she called the proposal unfair for students and 
the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to cut the services for the students, but these are the 
services we pay for in our fees," said Rhedis Thomas, 19, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students Friday had not yet considered how the proposals might affect 
their academic lives, and others were "reactionless," as Aaron Mukhopadhyay put 
it. Said the 21-year-old student with a smirk: "They're always cutting funding! 
It's hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior David Kesselman, president of undergraduate student government at UCI, 
said students were not represented on either budget task force. There will be 
student representatives, however, on the committees that review the 
recommendations. Kesselman said the chancellor assured him that the their 
suggestions will be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cicerone on Friday questioned whether the task force proposals can solve 
the school's budget problems. "My fear is that with the budget so bad, even if 
we adopt all of these recommendations, we will still be in financial trouble," 
he said. "We're not expecting the University of California to be healed for a 
long time."

BRISTOL STREET EXPANSION FIGHT RENEWED AT COURT HEARING; REDEVELOPMENT: 
RESIDENTS WHO WOULD BE DISPLACED CHARGE THAT SANTA ANA HAS NOT FOUND THEM NEW 
HOUSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Opponents of Santa Ana's controversial Bristol Corridor Redevelopment Project 
faced off with city officials in Superior Court on Friday, arguing that the 
city has not complied with a state appellate court ruling that it find new 
housing for hundreds of families. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for a businessman and single mother in the proposed 783-acre project 
area who filed suit in 1990 also said the city has not adequately explained why 
non-blighted property next to a stretch of Bristol Street, which is slated for 
widening, is included in the project boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 4th District Court of Appeal agreed early last year that the general 
project area was blighted, it ordered city officials to resolve those two 
remaining issues before proceeding with the redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana City Atty. Edward J. Cooper countered Friday that the city has met 
its obligations, saying there is ample housing in Santa Ana for families who 
would be forced to move during the 35-year span of the plan. That housing 
includes homes for sale as well as rentals that accept federal subsidy 
vouchers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert A. Knox listened to both sides and took the matter 
under advisement. He said he expects to rule within a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the city's $355-million plan to expand Bristol Street from four 
lanes to six between Memory Lane and Central Avenue, and revamp more than a 
dozen commercial areas along the strip. The council approved the project in 
late 1989 after 2 1/2 years of planning, but the lawsuit has ensured that all 
tax money generated by property in the proposed zone be frozen in an escrow 
account. In addition, the city has only been able to acquire property from 
those volunteering to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they have nevertheless proceeded with plans for the 
street-widening. Since 1989, the city has spent about $5 million in federal 
grants to purchase roughly 30 properties along Bristol Street between McFadden 
and Edinger avenues, and to relocate the displaced residents and businesses, 
said Robert B. Hoffman, redevelopment and real estate manager for the Community 
Development Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But those residents and business owners who want to stay in the area have not 
been able to apply for rehabilitation loans, which would be available if the 
project had been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has been controversial from the start, and required a four-fifths 
council majority vote for approval after a committee of businesses and 
residents formed to review the plan overwhelmingly rejected it in 1988. 
Residents in the area also complained that they had never been informed of the 
project details in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 While most residents in the area -- parts of which have been plagued by 
drug-dealing -- agreed that the neighborhood should be improved, the fear of 
displacement quickly took center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Richard Spix, who represents Robert T. Gonzales, an optometrist with 
offices in the project area, and Evangelina Avalos, a single mother in the 
zone, said Friday that the city failed to identify exactly how many families 
would be displaced by the project. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the housing that city officials are pointing to as available is either 
too expensive for many of the Bristol project-area residents, or substandard. 
Spix visited and photographed at least six addresses listed by the city as 
potential replacement housing units that accept federal vouchers, and said he 
found them roach-infested, with deteriorated sewage systems and other 
structural problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Spix entered his photographs as evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throwing (them) out onto the less-than-tender mercies of the Santa Ana 
housing market really does these hundreds of families a disservice," he told 
the judge, asking him to abide by the appellate decision and bring an end to 
the project. "The city has totally failed to do what the Court of Appeal has 
requested." 
</P>
<P>
 Spix said he found it ironic that a city plagued by residential overcrowding 
would point to such an availability of housing. He also said the city should 
have explained in more detail why the properties off Bristol Street qualify as 
blighted. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials countered that a staff report prepared late last year 
adequately addresses all of those concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The area off Bristol Street should be included in the project area because 
overcrowding and high crime qualify the entire neighborhood as blighted, Cooper 
said. It was included in the project area in order "to keep boundaries 
uniform," not solely for the purpose of generating tax revenue for the 
redevelopment zone, which is against the law, city documents filed with the 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our staff has made a very good effort in answering the questions 
raised by the 4th District Court of Appeal," Cooper told Knox, adding that 
redevelopment law ensures no one will be left on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the Redevelopment Agency can move anybody out of a house, it has to 
have replacement housing for that family," he said. "That's what the law says." 
</P>
<P>
 Families would be moved out gradually, over the life-span of the redevelopment 
project, making it nearly impossible to identify who they will be, or find 
housing for them now, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the project has been held up by legal action possibly 
longer than any other redevelopment plan in the city's history. But they vowed 
to persevere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a grind, but I'm not frustrated. We just think it's part of the 
process," Hoffman said. "For every (redevelopment) project the city has 
adopted, there seems to be some kind of legal challenge. We'll keep working on 
it until the court says we've got it right."

PARENTS ASK COUNCIL TO BACK CHILDREN'S MUSEUM; THOUSAND OAKS: A NATIVE PEOPLES 
CENTER IS ALSO PROPOSED FOR LAND ADJACENT TO THE CIVIC ARTS PLAZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents in Thousand Oaks are urging the City Council to consider building a 
children's museum next to the Civic Arts Plaza, which they say would make the 
new cultural center more appealing to families. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is set to decide Tuesday whether they want staff members to 
research the request for a children's museum while also reviewing a proposal 
for a native peoples museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents began campaigning for a children's museum several months ago, and 
presented the council with a letter signed by about 3,000 residents on Tuesday. 
The letter recommends construction of the museum on 11 acres at the eastern end 
of the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Jaime Zukowski said the council should recognize that the need 
for such a museum has been ignored for too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been tremendous support for a children's museum in the community, 
and this seemed to be an appropriate time to look into it," Zukowski said. 
"It's really something that this area needs and does not have." 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski said the city has known about public interest in a children's museum 
for some time, but hasn't aggressively pursued the idea because it is not 
viewed as a revenue producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the council approved 60 hours of staff time to review a plan for a 
native peoples museum, and Zukowski said it would be unfair not to consider the 
idea of a children's museum as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all fairness, this has been an identified desire for some time," she said. 
"The idea of putting a museum up should involve looking into more than just one 
type of museum." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who supported the idea of a children's museum said they were excited 
that the council may finally take up their issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an incredible children's museum in downtown L.A. and there's a nice 
little one in Oxnard. We just wanted the city to think about putting one in 
between," said Mary Ann Downs, who helped draft the letter to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started as a bunch of parents sitting around with this idea, and we'd like 
to see it become something more than that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Downs said she envisions a museum where children can learn about the world 
around them by touching and exploring items that would normally be off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have to be anything super-duper fancy," said Downs, who has a 
3-year-old child and has worked as a child development specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "A children's exhibit is something hands-on, where they can play with skeletal 
bones or try on a firefighter's uniform or go into a recording studio and make 
up a song," she said. "Interactive learning plays a crucial role in a child's 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah said she supports the idea of a children's museum because 
it would fit into the Thousand Oaks community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousand Oaks has always been a magnet for families," Zeanah said. "I think 
this is a very desirable endeavor."

OPERATION SECOND CHANCE PREPARES FOR 3RD MEDICAL MISSION TO BALKANS; 
HUMANITARIAN: FOUNDER AND HUNTINGTON BEACH RESIDENT SONJA HAGEL DECIDES TO GO 
AS PLANNED DESPITE THE THREAT OF NATO AIR STRIKES ON BOSNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Sonja Hagel made last-minute preparations this week to take a team of 
physicians on her third medical mission to the Balkans, she was wondering if 
the threatened NATO air strike on Bosnia would alter her plans. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bosnian Serbs did not comply with NATO's disarmament ultimatum, she 
knew she wouldn't be able to fly safely into Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I have other options. There would be alternative locations for us to go 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina," said the Huntington Beach resident who is determined to 
help that war-torn region through Operation Second Chance, the medical aid 
organization she founded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our compulsion is to keep going back to help them," said Hagel, who leaves 
today. "If we were in their shoes, we would want the outside world to reach 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, convoys of Serbian artillery began pulling out Thursday after 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin promised to commit Russian troops to new 
peacekeeping duties in Sarajevo if the Serbs would withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the 17 surgeons recruited for the mission are aware of the risk 
of continuing warfare, Hagel said, noting, "I have had heart-to-heart talks 
with all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagel said she also has given them the World Health Organization's security 
guidelines for traveling in Bosnia, which recommends, among other things, that 
they pack flak jackets and helmets. She said the group also will pack dried 
food with them because of a severe shortage of local food supplies. And they 
will take flashlights so they can work after nightfall in field hospitals that 
lack electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagel, the associate director of Century City Hospital in Los Angeles, said 
the physician volunteers, most of whom are paying their own travel expenses, 
are trained in specialties needed by the war-wounded: emergency medicine, 
orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery and plastic surgery.  
</P>
<P>
 The doctors come from various parts of the United States and three have been 
recruited from Hagel's hometown of Klagenfurt, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 The physicians have been divided into two groups, Hagel said: One team will be 
deployed to hospitals outside the war zone in Zagreb and Split, Croatia, where 
many wounded Bosnians have been transported. The other will help at makeshift 
field hospitals somewhere in Bosnia, depending on where the United Nations will 
permit the team to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "The objective of the trip is to provide relief to local doctors and to take 
care of patients in their homeland," Hagel said.  
</P>
<P>
 The doctors expect to perform 80 to 100 surgical procedures during their 
two-week stay, Hagel said, with a special focus on treating children who are 
war victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she said, visiting physicians will take with them medical 
supplies donated by American vendors and provide educational materials and 
mini-lectures to local physicians who have been unable to keep up with advances 
in their specialized fields during wartime. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagel said that while the physicians will strive to treat war victims in their 
homeland, "every time we go, we bring patients back." She said that 
"inevitably" the doctors identify difficult cases that require more 
sophisticated medical attention in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagel last August found American hospitals and doctors who agreed to accept 
and treat without charge 19 disabled Bosnians who were airlifted from Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she said, Operation Second Chance has brought four more patients, 
including a 10-year-old girl and 11-year-old boy, to the United States for free 
medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Antoine Kazzi, an emergency medicine specialist at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, planned to board a Delta Air Lines jet with Hagel this morning at Los 
Angeles International Airport. The first leg of the journey will take them to 
Frankfurt, Germany. From there they will fly to Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazzi, who will turn 31 while on the trip, is going to Bosnia for the second 
time. He said Hagel arranged for him last December to spend three weeks at a 
field hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazzi said he was impressed by the dedication and skill of the Bosnian 
doctors, who have learned to make do with a shortage of ventilators and other 
equipment. "Some are very exhausted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazzi also observed that at the Balkan hospitals, doctors of diverse ethnic 
backgrounds are working side by side to save the lives of ethnically diverse 
patients, despite the inter-ethnic war raging around them. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are doing is just a drop in a sea of pain," Kazzi conceded, but 
emphasizing that the trip is still worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a gesture to people who are in severe suffering and distress that other 
humans care," he said.

PRECIPITATION PELTS AREA, MORE DUE; DRIVING IS RISKY

 An unstable mass of air trailing Thursday's chilly storm dropped scattered 
rain, hail and snow on Southern California on Friday evening, and forecasters 
said a new storm should bring more precipitation tonight and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite briefly heavy rain in a number of areas Friday, there were no reports 
of new mudslides on the hillsides denuded during last fall's destructive brush 
fires in Laguna Beach, Malibu and Altadena.There were some slides in Malibu on 
Thursday, but damage was generally light. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Clemente, 12 cars collided on the rain-slick Interstate 5 Friday 
afternoon, slightly injuring one driver. All northbound lanes were shut down 
for about 15 minutes at Camino de Estrella as tow trucks moved the cars, said 
California Highway Patrol Officer Rick Pena. Traffic backed up for about a mile 
and a half, and was delayed about 45 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About a 10th of an inch of rain fell in southern Orange County Friday. 
Temperatures were expected to be in the mid -- 50s today. 
</P>
<P>
 Pea-size hail was reported during a blustery thundershower in Banning on 
Friday, and National Weather Service observers said their radar showed ice 
pellets in several cloudbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said heavy snow fell Friday afternoon at Idyllwild, Wrightwood and 
Big Bear City, with as much as six inches piling up in some areas by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow levels as low as 3,000 feet, with temperatures dropping into the 20s, 
were reported in some parts of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains 
Friday night. Police said driving conditions were hazardous in most mountain 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the center of the new storm will pass to the north of the Los 
Angeles area. They said there's a slight chance of a few additional sprinkles 
through Monday, with skies clearing again on Tuesday.

POLICE QUESTION MAN ON ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Port Hueneme police said Friday that a man arrested after allegedly trying to 
rob an Oxnard dairy store may be the suspect sought in two earlier armed 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 James Kenneth Myers, 29, was arrested on Thursday after a clerk at Chase 
Bros.Dairy foiled his robbery attempt by refusing to give him money and then 
chasing him down the street, police said. The clerk said he believed Myers' gun 
was fake. 
</P>
<P>
 After Myers was arrested following a foot chase, police found his car parked a 
short distance from the dairy store on Channel Islands Boulevard. It matched a 
vehicle linked to a robbery the day before at the Waffle Factory in Port 
Hueneme, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers also resembled a composite sketch drawn from witness descriptions of the 
man who robbed the Video Store on North Ventura Road on Feb. 4, Port Hueneme 
Police Sgt. Jerry Beck said.

SUSPECT SOUGHT IN 2 BANK ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back-to-back robberies at Bank of America branches on Friday may have been the 
work of one man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch at 3475 Via Lido was robbed about 1:15 p.m. of an unknown amount of 
money, Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said.A gunman walked in, confronted 
a teller and demanded cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five minutes later, the branch at 3300 E. Coast Highway was hit, also 
by a lone gunman, who escaped with an unknown amount of money, Gonis said. In 
that robbery, the gunman confronted several tellers simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses of each robbery described the suspect as a white man with a mustache 
who was wearing a jacket and a baseball cap, Gonis said.  
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in either incident, and no shots were fired, Gonis said.

<P>
 A man shot to death in a supermarket parking lot was identified Friday as 
Oscar Serrano Miramontes, 40, of Costa Mesa, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 21-year-old suspect, Salvador Beltran-Duarte of Santa Ana, was being held 
Friday in the city jail without bail, police investigator George Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beltran-Duarte was to be arraigned Tuesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators still did not know the motive in the shooting that occurred 
about 2 p.m. Thursday at the Stater Bros. market at 2180 Newport Blvd., Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not say whether the victim knew his suspected killer. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman accompanying Miramontes watched the shooting helplessly and cried 
loudly next to his body as the gunman fled in a Volkswagen Golf, witnesses told 
police. An onlooker reported the getaway car's license number, which allowed 
officers to spot and follow the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 During the chase, the driver of the Volkswagen threw out a revolver at a gas 
station at Newport Boulevard and 19th Street, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Ana officer saw the car as it entered Santa Ana. Police forced it to 
the side of the road in the 1100 block of North English Street and arrested 
Beltran-Duarte, Wilson said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; THE CASE OF THE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING; 
NORTHRIDGE: MALL CLEANUP WORKERS ARE CAUGHT WEARING ASBESTOS-TAINTED INVENTORY 
SLATED FOR DISPOSAL. BUT ARE THEY GUILTY OF ANY CRIME? 
</P>

<P>
 When police showed up at the heavily damaged Sears store in the Northridge 
Fashion Center to investigate complaints that the cleanup crew was clearing out 
more than asbestos in the wake of the earthquake, they were puzzled at first. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 members of the asbestos cleanup crew were wearing brand-new clothes 
out of contaminated and sealed-off areas inside the store, despite orders from 
Sears, Roebuck & Co. to legally dispose of the tainted items by sealing them 
and taking them to a toxic-waste dump, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But can you be charged with stealing something that has already been deemed 
rubbish? 
</P>
<P>
 After detaining crew members Thursday, police conferred with prosecutors in 
the city attorney and district attorney's offices. They determined that the 
answer is no -- that no theft had occurred, said Lt. John Dunkin of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. The men were released, and no charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean the cleanup crew is in the clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will also be meeting with the district attorney's staff and other 
authorities, Dunkin said, to ascertain whether crew members broke environmental 
laws regulating the disposal of hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is still to be explored is whether taking those contaminated items 
constitutes some health-and-safety violation," he said. "We will explore that 
so we can answer the questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said the items apparently were exposed to asbestos as a result of the 
earthquake and were "commingled" with the debris. Sears "considered the 
clothing contaminated and wanted it disposed of," Dunkin said. "Apparently, 
rather than disposing it, the cleaning crew kept some part or all of the 
clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Regulations concerning the removal of asbestos -- who may do it and where and 
how it must be disposed of -- are stringent because the material is considered 
a potentially deadly carcinogen. If inhaled, asbestos fibers can cause lung and 
other cancers. However, the substance is considered safe when left intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Objects contaminated by asbestos, as the clothing may have been, would have to 
be thoroughly decontaminated before being removed from the site or would have 
to be disposed of by being properly bagged, labeled and hauled to a landfill 
approved to accept such waste, according to asbestos-removal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Sgt. Roger Dowis said mall security guards first noticed 
something was amiss and then caught the crew members late Thursday as they were 
wearing or carrying goods out of the closed-off store. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew stuff was being (taken) because they'd look at it and it was 
brand-new," Dowis said. "Security guards were looking at these guys and saying, 
'Hey! You're wearing Sears clothing, and Sears shoes that were brand-new.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of the workers were involved in this," Dowis said. "For two or 
three days, when they were working on the asbestos." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Graham, a Sears manager, said Friday that the company was investigating 
but had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos cleanup at the shopping center has required a massive, 
multimillion-dollar effort. The mall, located about a mile from the epicenter, 
was badly damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake and is expected to remain closed 
for at least several months. 
</P>
<P>
 One Sears employee familiar with the situation said, "They wouldn't let us go 
in and get our personal effects because they are tainted with asbestos." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he said, the cleanup crew "were wearing new shoes when they were caught, 
and a few pair of pants each."

MYSTERY SURROUNDS MISSING MAN; INVESTIGATION: JAMES YOUNG, 73, OF QUARTZ HILL 
DISAPPEARED 13 MONTHS AGO. DETECTIVES ARE NOW LOOKING AT THE CASE AS A POSSIBLE 
MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirteen months ago, 73-year-old James Young went to Las Vegas for what was to 
be a short getaway and he still hasn't come home. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors feared for months that Young met with foul play. And it 
appears those fears are finally being taken seriously -- the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department Homicide Bureau began investigating Young's disappearance 
earlier this month as a possible murder. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no charges filed and homicide detectives say they are facing 
what they expect will be a long investigation. When Young was first reported 
missing, detectives from that bureau interviewed neighbors and a man named 
Michael Benanti, a 35-year-old landscaper and ex-convict who had moved into 
Young's spacious Quartz Hill home shortly after Young's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Benanti, who said he was Young's business partner, told a missing persons 
investigator that Young had met a woman named Rosie, married her and moved to 
Mexico -- leaving him in charge of his business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives spent Friday sifting through Young's home and personal records. 
</P>
<P>
 Making their job that much harder is the man at the center of the mystery: 
Young was a complicated person who led an eccentric life. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove a Porsche whose license plate letters stood for Greek God -- symbolic 
of his belief that he was the consummate ladies' man, even though friends say 
they never saw him do anything more than talk about women. 
</P>
<P>
 His huge back yard resembled a junk yard, littered with machinery he bought at 
auctions and the many cars and trucks he owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz and Trixie, his two Rottweilers, shared his water bed with him at night. 
Friends say he loved the ferocious-looking dogs like the children he never had. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all else, Young was a penny-pinching, cantankerous old man who got along 
best with those who yelled back as he cursed them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a pain in the ass," said friend Cindy McEuen of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Porsche and its vanity plates are gone. Much of the back yard's 
contents are missing. Fritz and Trixie, who were left unattended when Young 
went to Las Vegas, are nowhere to be found. And neither is Young. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 2, more than a year after his disappearance and 12 months after a 
friend reported him missing, Young's case was moved from missing persons to the 
homicide bureau because of the "suspicious circumstances," said Detective 
Michael Scott of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Homicide Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Young just fell off the face of the Earth," the detective said. Young's 
bank accounts have sat idle for more than a year; there's no evidence he's 
received medical care in either California or Nevada, and all other paths of 
inquiry to find Young alive have led nowhere. Now they're trying to find a 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors have feared for months that Young met with foul play. 
</P>
<P>
 Running off, leaving behind his dogs, and abandoning all the possessions he 
had amassed are too out of character for Young to be even remotely plausible, 
friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 Possessions were important to Young, a retired machinist who liked to wheel 
and deal and buy equipment. "He liked to go to auctions and buy crates of 
things," said his friend, McEuen. 
</P>
<P>
 He was only going to Las Vegas to drop off one of his three campers at a 
trailer park. He was doing it, friends said, so he could avoid the expense of 
hotels when he went to gamble, a recreation he enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very frugal, to say the least," said Martin Vogel, a neighbor who said 
when he had Young to breakfast "the old man" complained about the eggs and 
coffee so much Vogel almost threw him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaining was as much a part of life for Young as eating and drinking. If 
the food at a restaurant wasn't served the way Young had ordered it, "he'd send 
it back, with a loud voice," McEuen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a man who was used to getting his way," she said. "It was his way or 
no way." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogel said, "He would ask for help, then you'd go over and help him and he'd 
start screaming at you." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as 30 years ago, McEuen said, Young completely cut off relations with 
his only sibling, a sister, because of a disagreement. Most people who knew 
Young didn't know he had any relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim always told me, 'I ain't got no God-damn relatives,' that all his money 
was going to (the state)," said Herb Williams, a friend who lives in Young's 
North Hollywood home, which is one of at least two facing foreclosure because 
the mortgage payments haven't been made in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even some confusion about how many times Young was married; it's 
either once or twice depending on who you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple years ago Young had considered marrying a young Filipino woman with 
whom he had become acquainted through letters and pictures. He was attracted to 
younger, foreign women, some say because he was looking for a caretaker as much 
as a wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before Christmas in 1990, Young suffered a stroke. A couple years ago he 
had another one. Although he recovered quickly, he was left with a limp and a 
speech impediment. The strokes frustrated Young. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his inability to do heavy labor that led Young to befriend Benanti, the 
man who said Young ran off to Mexico. Benanti worked for the landscape company 
that installed the shrubs and grass in the pricey Quartz Hill tract where Young 
moved in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was, not surprisingly, unhappy with the landscaping work at his new 
home. Benanti came to Young's house in response to the complaints and within a 
short time, Benanti was mowing Young's lawn and maintaining the plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither neighbors or friends knew much about Benanti and when he moved into 
Young's house shortly after Young's Las Vegas trip it raised some eyebrows. 
Other than Fritz and Trixie, Young did not have housemates. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say Benanti hasn't been at Young's house much in the past few weeks. 
After a date for the foreclosure sale was set earlier this month, Benanti began 
removing a lot of things from the house, including the back-yard spa. Benanti's 
whereabouts are unknown to detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives are now trying to freeze Young's assets and halt the foreclosures, 
Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, investigators changed the locks on the house and put yellow 
police tape around it. 
</P>
<P>
 While friends and neighbors fear the worst, they still maintain some hope that 
Young is alive. Investigators are just beginning what is expected to be a long 
search for some sign of the cantankerous old man, a sign that now may have 
faded.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; RUMORS ENHANCE ACTUAL SIZE OF QUAKE, EXPERTS 
SAY; SEISMOLOGY: CONFUSION AMONG DIFFERENT SCALES FUELS BELIEFS THAT TEMBLOR 
WAS LARGER THAN REPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Confusion over different kinds of measurements of the size of the Northridge 
earthquake has led to rumors, growing into convictions in some quarters, that 
the quake was bigger than it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that numbers used in some measurements -- such as the 
Modified Mercalli scale, or gravity force readings from strong motion 
accelerographs -- are frequently higher than those used by scientists in news 
reports of the magnitude of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A 9 or 10 reading on the Mercalli scale, normally stated in Roman numerals as 
IX or X, is not a magnitude reading, does not measure the same phenomena, and 
does not alter the 6.8-magnitude now used by the National Earthquake 
Information Center in Golden, Colo., to describe the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a chart that has been circulating in the San Fernando Valley by 
fax, or passed hand to hand, seems to say that the quake reached an unheard-of 
magnitude 9.8 in San Fernando and 9.5 in Northridge, among other spots. But 
these are not magnitude readings, seismologists and Caltech researchers pointed 
out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some callers to The Times have said the chart comes from Caltech. But Caltech 
spokesmen say the school put out no such chart, noting that, in any case, there 
is only one magnitude reading per quake, which does not vary from one community 
to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magnitude of an earthquake does not change with location," a Caltech 
spokesman said. "The Northridge earthquake was (the same) whether you live in 
Northridge or in San Diego."  
</P>
<P>
 The commonly used magnitude scales are based on the power of the earthquake at 
the spot where it started, although they also reflect the length of the fault 
rupture and the duration of the shaking. The Northridge earthquake could not 
have been an 8, scientists say, because the fault rupture was not long enough, 
nor did the shaking last long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.8-magnitude quake lasted, including reverberations of quake waves, no 
more than 30 seconds. By contrast, the shaking from the great Alaska earthquake 
of 1964, whose magnitude was put by some scientists at 8.9, lasted as long as 
seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity of the shaking, moment by moment, might not have been much 
stronger than the worst moments of the Northridge earthquake, but the Alaska 
quake is rated as more powerful because it lasted longer and affected a bigger 
area, seismologists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge magnitude, first put at 6.6, was later officially upgraded to 
6.8 by the scientists at Golden, using a surface wave scale, and to 6.7 by 
Caltech, the U.S. Geological Survey and UC Berkeley, using a moment magnitude 
scale of quake waves that have passed through the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these groups used the old Richter scale, which has fallen into disuse 
because it distorts readings of quakes larger than magnitude 5. Caltech 
scientist Egill Hauksson noted recently that the Richter reading of the 
Northridge quake would have been only 6.4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercalli scale, developed by the Italian seismologist Giuseppi Mercalli in 
1902, and modified by American seismologists Harry Wood and Frank Neumann in 
1931, is a set of criteria, numbered from I to XII, that is used to describe a 
quake as it is variably experienced at many different locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a quake may rate a XII ("Damage is total, and practically all works of 
construction are damaged greatly or destroyed") near the epicenter. But the 
same quake would rate only a I ("Not felt by people, except under especially 
favorable circumstances") at another place, several hundred miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the scale is based on subjectively perceived affects, rather than 
objectively measured ground movement, it has fallen out of use by 
seismologists. 
</P>
<P>
 The authorized descriptions are fairly lengthy, and most anyone who has felt a 
quake, by reading through the criteria under each Roman numeral, can form a 
conclusion as to what the Mercalli scale reading was where he or she felt the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, at a hearing of the California Seismic Safety Commission, Richard 
Andrews, the director of the state Office of Emergency Services, released a map 
of "estimated Modified Mercalli intensities" for the Northridge quake, 
developed by EQE, a firm in San Francisco. Andrews hoped the map would show the 
quake in a different perspective, with its widely varying affects. 
</P>
<P>
 The map showed various Mercalli intensities, ranging from X in Northridge and 
Reseda, down to VI in Malibu, Torrance, Carson, Long Beach and other points, 
and less than VI farther away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercalli definition for X shown on the map was: "Most masonry and frame 
structures destroyed with their foundations. Some well-built wooden structures 
and bridges destroyed. Serious damage to dams, dikes, embankments. Large 
landslides . . . Rails bent slightly." 
</P>
<P>
 The definition for VI was: "Felt by all. Many frightened and run outdoors. 
Persons walk unsteadily. Windows, dishes, glassware broken. Knick knacks, 
books, etc. off shelves. Pictures off walls. Furniture moved or overturned. 
Weak plaster and masonry cracked." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people from Van Nuys, which was mostly assigned a IX, felt that the 
shaking in their neighborhood was, instead, a VI, and they also questioned why 
nearby Sherman Oaks, where damage was greater, was assigned only an VIII, less 
than Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews, when asked about such matters, noted that the map reflected a 
computer model and not interviews with residents of specific neighborhoods 
coming to a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Scawthorne, EQE's vice president for research and development, readily 
agreed Friday that the map released last week "is based on certain 
approximations," and where more than one type of shaking occurred within a 
neighborhood, he acknowledged that the Mercalli measurement had split the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the main message is, this map is a simplified picture of the effects 
of the earthquake," he concluded. "In general, it's accurate. In detail, it may 
not be." 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, the chart being circulated by unknown parties in the Valley 
appears to list EQE's assigned Mercalli levels as if they were magnitudes. 
Changing Roman numerals to Arabic ones, it conveys the false impression that 
the magnitude for the quake was higher than announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Scawthorne said he believes that another type of quake measurement -- 
accelerographic instruments measuring gravity forces, which has come more into 
vogue in the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake -- should be a preferred 
form of measurement. 
</P>
<P>
 These numbers, such as the extraordinarily high 1.82g Tarzana reading reported 
in a Times story Friday, show shaking intensities at various points, and may be 
a better way of gauging the strength of an earthquake at various points than 
either magnitude or Mercalli scales. 
</P>
<P>
 But accelerographs must be there before the quake occurs, and in most recent 
quakes, they have been too widely scattered to provide a comprehensive picture.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; HISTORIC GROUP REVIVES INTEREST IN TREATY 
SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The doors of the park building at Campo de Cahuenga are nearly always locked. 
Inside, the portraits of Lt. Col. John C. Fremont and Gen. Andres Pico spend 
most of the year in darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 To Guy W. McCreary, fourth-generation descendant of North Hollywood's pioneer 
Weddington family, the portraits seem to peer reproachfully back at him through 
the gloom on the rare days he comes to press his face to the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 McCreary is determined to bring these long-dead soldiers back into the public 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 As the new head of a recently formed group of Campo de Cahuenga enthusiasts, 
he has launched an effort to revive the memorial which marks their noteworthy 
contribution: the 1847 Capitulation at Cahuenga. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty, signed by both men somewhere near the Campo de Cahuenga Memorial, 
officially ended hostilities between the U.S. forces of Fremont and the Mexican 
forces of Pico. Its terms paved the way for U.S. annexation of the California 
province. 
</P>
<P>
 The Campo de Cahuenga Memorial, located at 3919 Lankershim Blvd., was built 
with city funds in 1950 in honor of the treaty signing. Although the park built 
there was constructed in Spanish rancho style, it is only an approximation of 
what the original ranch house on the site may have looked like. 
</P>
<P>
 McCreary calls Campo de Cahuenga "the greatest little unknown place in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by the parks department and officially recognized by the city of Los 
Angeles as a historic monument, Campo de Cahuenga now serves as a park and 
occasional meeting place for community groups. So far, it has never lived up to 
its promise as a historic landmark, McCreary said. 
</P>
<P>
 But late last year, McCreary and 20 others formed the Campo de Cahuenga 
Historic Memorial Assn., a group dedicated to making the memorial a destination 
for students and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly named Campo curator Jim Gulbranson is drafting a master plan outlining 
the group's aims. Although the Jan. 17 earthquake caused some cosmetic damage 
to the site, it will not affect the group's plans, McCreary said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCreary and Gulbranson talk of starting a docents program at the site, adding 
a snack bar and bookstore, renovating the interior of the park building and 
installing historic displays, dioramas, costumed mannequins and maps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to try to turn this into something where schoolchildren will come to 
see it," Gulbranson said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCreary, who keeps a picture of Oliver North on his office desk, lauds the 
political prowess of President James K. Polk, and waxes poetic about Manifest 
Destiny. He is passionate that the memorial be revived lest the contribution of 
Pico and Fremont be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, as it stands, Campo de Cahuenga hardly merits a second look from 
motorists whizzing by on Lankershim Boulevard. Few Californians seem to realize 
the full significance of the Capitulation at Cahuenga, he said.

 Gulbranson said the group will seek donations and grants from longtime L.A. 
corporations, historical societies and educational foundations. The group aims 
to have a bona fide historic destination established by 1997, the 150th 
anniversary of the treaty, he said.

 High on their list of goals is getting a visitors parking lot near the site, 
and making sure a future Metrolink station that has been proposed in the 
vicinity will include information to guide travelers to the memorial.

 "People don't understand what this was," said Gulbranson. "We want to try to 
tell them." JILL LEOVY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; FOURTH MALL GARAGE TO BE DEMOLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fourth and final parking garage at Northridge Fashion Center has been 
slated for demolition, mall managers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Miller, general manager, said a garage on the east side of the mall off 
Tampa Avenue will be torn down within 10 days for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The garage was heavily damaged in the Jan. 17 quake. The rubble of one garage, 
which collapsed in the quake, has already been removed. The others were left 
standing, but were structurally damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 A garage on the north side of the mall is being removed this week, and last 
week officials announced the largest parking structure, situated on the west 
side of the mall, would also be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said engineers completed an analysis of the garage on Tampa Avenue and 
found that some of the pillars inside were leaning. Miller stopped short of 
saying the fourth garage would be impossible to render safe. He said only: "We 
have some doubts so we are going to remove it." 
</P>
<P>
 The garage was built in 1971 using concrete poured in place, as was the garage 
on the west side of the mall. The two other parking structures were built in 
1988 and 1989 using precast concrete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are to replace all four garages, Miller added. JILL LEOVY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RAIN EXPECTED TO TAPER OFF THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Showers were expected to taper off this weekend and give way to sunny skies by 
Monday as the Alaskan storm that dropped from one to three inches of rain on 
Ventura County moves eastward, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 20% chance of showers remains today, with dark and cloudy skies throughout 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have some lingering rain showers," said David Gomberg, a 
meteorologist for the National Weather Service. "But it looks like we will be 
back to more of the usual -- warm and dry -- through most of next week," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm brought up to 1.5 inches to the coast and inland valleys, and left 
two to three inches in the mountain areas, Gomberg said. Snow levels dropped to 
3,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Pinos, which stands at 8,900 feet, was dusted with six inches of snow, 
said Tracie Welton, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman. A break in the 
threatening skies could trigger an influx of people heading to the mountains 
above Ojai over the Presidents' Day weekend, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could get up to 10,000 to 20,000 cars a day," Welton said. "The weekend 
brings a lot of cross-country skiers and people who like to play in the snow." 
</P>
<P>
 Welton warned visitors to drive cautiously and carry chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain caused several minor accidents around the county, California Highway 
Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also helped efforts to clean up an oil spill caused when a pipeline 
ruptured during last month's earthquake. Crews have been working since then to 
clean up an estimated 147,000 gallons of crude oil that poured into the Santa 
Clara River from a ruptured Atlantic Richfield pipeline in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water helped a bit because it flushed out remaining oil trapped in 
sediments and vegetation," said Bob Schlichting, California Department of Fish 
and Game spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlichting said the remaining oil is difficult to remove. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a light sheen of oil on the river now; unfortunately it's not 
thick enough for us to recover," he said. The remaining oil has also mixed with 
dirt and vegetation, he said. "There's still oil out there that birds and 
animals can get into." County Rainfall

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; BUSINESSES ASSESSING FULL IMPACT OF QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake has dealt a more serious blow to San Fernando's 
small business community than was previously thought, according to the city's 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on preliminary estimates, the temblor caused $12 million to $24 million 
in structural damage to businesses, said Bruce Cohen, executive vice president 
of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you, that is just the tip of the iceberg," Cohen said Friday. 
"We're trying to take a look at what it will take to bring these businesses 
back, and that's a lot of money. In addition, some businesses are up and 
running, but they're on one leg." 
</P>
<P>
 There are between 800 and 850 licensed businesses operating in the 
2.4-square-mile city, and officials are bracing for a serious jolt to sales tax 
revenues, City Administrator Mary Strenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando gets a 1% return from the state's 6.5% sales tax -- amounting to 
$4 million a year, Strenn said. That represents nearly a third of the city's 
general fund -- the part of the budget that pays for such things as police and 
daily operating expenses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sales tax is the most vulnerable," she said. "A lot of the impacts we won't 
feel immediately. It usually takes a minimum of a quarter (of a fiscal year) 
for sales tax receipts to be returned to us." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that 12 commercial structures housing 14 businesses 
were destroyed; another 52 buildings housing 61 businesses have been deemed 
unsafe, and 25 structures with 35 businesses are posted for limited access. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber and city officials fear that even those businesses that still can 
function might not survive the downturn in customer flow and the expense of 
replacing destroyed inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think about the fact that these businesses already had come through 
three years of recession, their cushion is gone," Strenn said. "Their staying 
power is depleted." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not all is doom and gloom. Construction and repairs could bring in more 
tax receipts and boost some businesses. The chamber also has found some of the 
businesses it is helping are more willing to join and pay dues, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, perhaps following the adage "If life gives you lemons, make lemonade," 
the chamber will hold a seminar next week to delve into ways to use the 
earthquake as a marketing tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain things you can do after an earthquake to improve business, 
like earthquake sales," Cohen said. GEOFFREY MOHAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; MALL CAN'T SERVE ALCOHOL IN PATIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials denied a popular mini-mall permission to serve alcohol in an 
open-air patio because the mall lacks sufficient parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Landini, a city zoning administrator, said the owners of the Laurel 
Promenade on Ventura Boulevard failed to provide enough parking spaces, more 
than one valet to park cars and reneged on a promise to not develop the 
2,021-square-foot covered patio. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they submitted just wasn't adequate," Landini said. "We found that some 
parking spaces were unusable. They had equipment in them or gas meter boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Landini said owners of the property had only one valet to park 
cars on a two-level parking area and had previously promised the city that they 
would use the patio area for pedestrian traffic only. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will deal with this as we have addressed everything else," said Tom 
O'Brien of Handelman Catherman Inc., who represents the owners of the 
mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The setback is the latest in a string of problems for the mini-mall. Residents 
protested the mall's opening when the developer failed to install additional 
turn lanes at the congested intersection as promised and again when the 
developer installed more signs than is allowed under local ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said the owners will appeal the decision this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said owners of the mini-mall failed to recognize the scale of the 
parking problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be hard to plan with what is already a built-in parking 
disaster," said Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City Residents Assn. "The 
mini-mall's demands are too big for the space allotted. They are trying to 
squeeze in too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Henry, planning deputy to Councilman Joel Wachs, said the decision was 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not working. The cars are on top of each other. No one would want to 
park there," he said, calling the mall owners "a victim of their own success."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; CHILDREN'S SERVICES GETS 2 NEW OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regional employees of the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services 
who were displaced by the earthquake were relocated this week to two new 
temporary offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake shook the Panorama City offices of the department's 
Region 5 so severely that the building was deemed unsafe for occupancy by the 
department's 200 employees.In the weeks that followed, social workers resorted 
to doing casework from home using their own telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 Region 5 provides children's services to an area stretching from the Antelope 
Valley to the San Fernando Valley. The agency is responsible for foster care, 
placement services, and intervention in child abuse cases. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, 60 clerical and supervisory workers finished moving into newly 
leased temporary offices at 6454 Van Nuys Blvd., said Evelyn Syvertsen, deputy 
regional administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Berger, director of DCS special services, said Thursday that officials 
were in the final stages of negotiation for a lease on a second building in the 
vicinity. Syvertsen said some employees may continue working from home for 
several months because of limited space in the new quarters.  
</P>
<P>
 The department is evaluating what equipment and supplies are needed to 
function efficiently, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing has been so traumatic," Syvertsen said, adding that several 
employees have lost homes or property in the quake. Asked whether the 
displacement had affected services, she said: "I really couldn't give you an 
honest answer. Workers are making every effort to provide services." JILL LEOVY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; PANEL URGES RAZING 47-YEAR-OLD STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 47-year-old Olive Memorial Stadium, once the site of the St. Louis Browns' 
spring training and professional football tryouts, should be torn down and 
replaced with a modern facility, a special study committee has recommended to 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful stadium," said John Dominguez, a member of the Burbank Parks 
and Recreation board, who once played baseball there for John Burroughs High 
School. "It's reminiscent of yesteryear." 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium has been closed in recent years for safety reasons. Although city 
officials have long considered tearing it down, there has been some public 
opposition, especially from those who remember the stadium's heyday when 
baseball legends like Satchel Paige, Bobby Thompson and others played there. 
</P>
<P>
 Park board member Terre Hirsch began a campaign to save the building, which 
led to the formation of the special committee made up of representatives of 
various community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a very sensitive issue," Hirsch said Wednesday night after 
committee members overwhelming voted in favor of tearing down the stadium to 
build a new one. The recommendation goes to the parks and recreation board, 
which will vote March 10 on whether to send the proposal to the City Council. 
"But this is the best way to deal with this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saying we should bite the bullet now and build a new facility," said Gary 
Sutliff, a member of the Burbank Historical Society and a committee member. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the committee members acknowledged the sentiment attached to the 
building, but voted for tearing down the structure in favor of a more modern 
facility for the city's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore Garcia, president of the Burbank Historical Society, said the 
society's board had voted not to try to protect the building because it did not 
have enough historic merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because it is old does not mean it is historically significant," Garcia 
said. "When we reviewed the building, we did not find anything architecturally 
significant." 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch said he would not predict yet what the parks and recreation board will 
do with the recommendation. ED BOND

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BERMAN PUSHES FOR QUAKE TAX RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) on Friday pledged to push Congress to 
grant income tax relief to Los Angeles residents whose damages from the 
Northridge earthquake aren't high enough to be deducted from their federal 
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman told a meeting of the San Fernando Chamber of Commerce that a bill he 
introduced this month would remove a restriction on deductible casualty losses, 
which now must exceed 10% of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income before they can 
be subtracted. If the restriction is removed, taxpayers could deduct the full 
amount of the casualty loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake insurance typically carries a steep deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Many taxpayers face losses too low to meet their insurance deductible or the 
10% threshold, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huge numbers of people will not be getting grants or loans," said Berman, 
whose 26th Congressional District includes San Fernando. "It's going to wipe 
out the life savings of people." 
</P>
<P>
 With a host of California co-sponsors, Berman introduced the tax reform bill 
Feb. 8. It is currently in the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodded by business owners irritated over government regulation, Berman agreed 
that the disaster showed federal officials could cut red tape if they had the 
will.  
</P>
<P>
 He said Congress might reconsider some of the regulations it enacted, however 
well-intentioned they may have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the procedures bogging down government were enacted to deal with 
other abuses," Berman noted. "Maybe there's a logic to re-examining how much of 
what we were hoping to achieve we actually accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman also pledged to keep the federal government focused on 
California's more long-term disasters: the collapse of the defense industry and 
the deep recession plaguing the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the defense-conversion issues will be continued," Berman said after 
the address. "They (the White House) are aware of the importance of California 
to the economy and to the elections." 
</P>
<P>
 For Berman, Friday's appearance also was a chance to hear praise for the 
federal relief effort in the San Fernando Valley, particularly in the city of 
San Fernando.  
</P>
<P>
 City and chamber officials credit him with persuading federal agency heads to 
open a disaster aid center in San Fernando, and ensuring that the small city 
did not get lost in wider relief efforts. GEOFFREY MOHAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor and environmentalist Ed Begley Jr. was unanimously confirmed Friday by 
the Los Angeles City Council to represent the city on the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy board. 
</P>
<P>
 Begley, who was nominated by Mayor Richard Riordan, was appointed to the 
eight-member panel that sets policy for the conservancy, a state agency that 
buys parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains and neighboring ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Begley, a Studio City resident who is best known for his role in the 
television series "St. Elsewhere," was previously named to the city's 
Environmental Affairs Commission, an advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking briefly to the council after being confirmed, Begley said he will 
"fulfill all the needs the city has" of him on the conservancy board. 
</P>
<P>
 Begley replaces Anton Calleia, a chief aide to former Mayor Tom Bradley and 
the city's representative on the conservancy board since 1982. HUGO MARTIN

JUDGE SAYS ROBBINS IS DUE FEES DESPITE CONVICTION; COURTS: RULING GRANTS FORMER 
VAN NUYS LAWMAKER FUNDS FROM PARTNERSHIP FOR PERIOD HE SPENT IN PRISON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Former state Sen. Alan Robbins is entitled to more than $200,000 in fees from 
a partnership that owns two Marina del Rey apartment complexes, despite his 
conviction and imprisonment on political corruption charges, a judge said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ernest Williams ruled tentatively that the 
onetime Van Nuys lawmaker can collect management fees from the partnership for 
the period between his December, 1991, guilty plea and his release from prison 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the Marina Two partnership said the fees would come to 
"somewhere between $200,000 and $300,000." A lawyer for Robbins said the amount 
would be about $270,000, plus up to $50,000 in interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership owns two complexes in Marina del Rey -- Bar Harbor and 
Deauville Marina -- that include 400 apartments, 700 boat slips and several 
commercial properties, including a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Both apartment complexes are built on county property and operate under 
long-term leases, Bar Harbor until 2022 and Deauville Marina until 2021. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina Two partner Douglas Ring sued Robbins in June, 1992, contending that 
public agencies refused to do business with the partnership because of Robbins' 
guilty plea and subsequent incarceration at Lompoc federal prison camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins countersued, arguing that the partnership's suit was an excuse to cut 
him off from guaranteed payments he was supposed to receive under a contract 
that predated his prison term by several years. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Robbins testified that he put together the purchase of the 
two apartment complexes using funds that came primarily from the late Selden 
Ring, a wealthy developer. After Ring became ill, his share in the partnership 
was transferred to his son, Douglas, a lawyer-lobbyist and Los Angeles city 
library commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership is trying to dissolve itself, and a trial in that matter is 
scheduled for April. But an attorney for Robbins said Friday that action is 
just another attempt to cut Robbins out of Marina Two. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate matter, Robbins is awaiting another judge's decision over 
whether he can keep his real estate broker's license.

BURBANK HIGH'S PROGRESSIVE PRINCIPAL DEMOTED BY SCHOOL BOARD; PERSONNEL: KEIKO 
HENTELL ENCOURAGED MULTIETHNIC GROUPS AT THE SCHOOL. OFFICIALS WON'T DISCUSS 
THE ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The principal of Burbank High School has been demoted to English teacher, in a 
move made by the Burbank school board behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither board members nor top administrators would discuss the reasoning 
behind the decision announced at the close of Thursday night's meeting of the 
Burbank Unified School District Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 But some teachers and community members speculated that Keiko Hentell, 
principal since 1991, was being replaced at least partly because of her 
progressive policies in encouraging multiethnic groups at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some programs in place which Burbank, not traditionally a 
minority's school, might not have been ready for," said Jack Kemp, a health 
teacher at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in a state of shock. I think we had a lady who was taking the school in 
a direction that was very positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell said Friday she was told by Supt. Arthur Pierce on Feb. 4 that her 
contract would not be renewed. Because she had recently received tenure in the 
district, the board had to offer her a teaching position in the fall, she said. 
She will continue to serve as principal until the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although you have attempted to address the needs of the increasingly diverse 
student body at Burbank High School, the decision-making process and 
relationships within the community at large need considerable improvement," 
Hentell said Pierce wrote to her in a memo. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials refused to comment Friday. "It's a personnel issue and I 
can't discuss it," board President Elena Hubbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hentell joined the district three years ago from a job as an assistant 
principal at University High School in Los Angeles, she inherited a school that 
was becoming increasingly more diverse with growing Latino, Armenian and Asian 
populations.  
</P>
<P>
 The school traditionally had had a large white enrollment. But now, white 
students are barely in the minority at 48%. Latinos make up 39% of the student 
body; blacks 3%, and 7.4% are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for ethnic diversity have applauded Hentell's efforts to work with 
the groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a tragedy, without a doubt," the Rev. John Simmons, a retired 
Lutheran minister and head of the Burbank Human Relations Council, said of the 
board's action. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was created to promote understanding among ethnic groups, and 
Hentell had asked for its help in solving many of the growing racial tensions 
she found at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We applauded it when she came here and we have applauded her ever since she 
arrived," Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Hentell's leadership, student groups formed to promote ethic culture and 
Latino groups and other programs were encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell said she also focused on decentralizing decision-making at the school, 
involving students, parents and teachers in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the absence of any direction from the board, I had no choice but to forge 
a new direction," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell said she will seek employment elsewhere.

JEWELRY STORE WORKER KILLED IN ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jewelry store employee was shot and killed in a robbery Friday, Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies responded to a 911 call at 1:11 p.m. from a person who looked into 
Charles Jewelers, at 38513 Sierra Highway, and saw smashed display cases, said 
Deputy Larry Mead of the Sheriff's Headquarters Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deputies arrived and looked through the open door and saw the store's 
employee lying on the floor," Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who was working alone at the time, was a 45-year-old man, Mead 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man's name was not released pending notification of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 An undetermined amount of jewelry was taken from the store and there were no 
clues to the identity of the killer, Mead said.

MAN APPARENTLY DIED OF HEART ATTACK IN FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who died on Valentine's Day after he was punched by the live-in friend 
of his estranged wife apparently died of a heart attack and not head injuries 
he suffered during the altercation, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives originally believed that Charles Lovinggood, 45, died after he hit 
his head on a slate tile floor after Steven Cartrett, 29, slugged him twice 
Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the incident, police said Lovinggood was upset because Cartrett was 
living in a house with Marilyn Lovinggood, 45, who had been separated from her 
husband for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Lovinggood told police that she and Cartrett were only friends and 
that Cartrett was living there because the earthquake had damaged his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartrett was not charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office has not released the results of 
Lovinggood's autopsy, a spokesman said.

POLICE ARREST 2 MEN IN CONDEMNED BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested two men at a condemned apartment building Friday -- one for 
allegedly attempting to loot the building and the other for entering the 
building and giving the first man permission to take what he wanted, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Devonshire's Volunteer Surveillance Team, a citizens watch group, 
noticed Edgar Pearson Jr., 56, of Van Nuys, carrying a pickax into an apartment 
building in the 8500 block of Balboa Boulevard that had been red-tagged after 
the quake, Officer Martin Pinner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers later watched the man climb onto the roof and throw materials 
over the side, Pinner said. By the time police arrived, the suspect was loading 
copper wire and a sink into his truck, Pinner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told us there was a guy living in the building who gave him permission," 
Pinner said. "So we went in and arrested him too because he was living in 
someone else's apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 The second man, Leon Outten, 34, of Van Nuys, was arrested for entering a 
condemned building, Pinner said.

 KING BIRTHDAY: The sixth annual Martin Luther King Jr. birthday celebration

RELIGION / JOHN DART; MILITARY BROADCASTS CHANGE TUNE; AIRWAVES: TO KEEP PACE 
WITH MODERN AUDIENCES, ARMED FORCES RADIO AND TELEVISION RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS ARE 
LIVELIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Armed Forces Radio and Television broadcasts religious programs for the 1.3 
million servicemen and women overseas, but for many years the military airwaves 
typically carried worship services, Bible studies and music by the likes of the 
Mormon Tabernacle Choir. 
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder then that surveys of the predominantly young military personnel 
ranked religious shows at the bottom, almost as expendable in their minds as 
big band and classical music. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, Christian rock music -- including the metal variety -- black 
gospel singing, and Top 10 contemporary Christian music dominate the five 
weekly hours of religious radio offered to military stations. And the religious 
television package is livelier too, with magazine-format shows and religious 
video shows done in the MTV style. 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation was largely the effort of two chaplains who have acted as 
religious program coordinators at a little-known military facility in the San 
Fernando Valley -- the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service Broadcast 
Center in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, both radio and television religious programming . . . 
will be compatible with our audience's lifestyles and tastes," Army Maj. David 
Smith, the current religious program coordinator, wrote to fellow chaplains 
after the revamped schedules were introduced last April. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feedback was extremely positive from programmers at a meeting here last 
December, because 70% of our audience is between the ages of 18 and 28," Smith 
said in an interview. Gerald Fry, a civilian who directs programming and news 
at the Sun Valley center, confirmed that the changes have had a good response. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were my choice, I'd put the Mormon Tabernacle Choir on every week," 
said Fry, who has been in broadcasting since 1952. "But the more contemporary 
the program, the more popular they are compared to the old-style religion 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Fry credited Smith's predecessor, Air Force Maj. Richard Davenport, with 
launching the innovations. One well-received change, Fry said, was the 
introduction of religious-themed children's television programs for military 
families with small children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armed Forces Radio and Television Network, received by U. S. military 
bases in 128 countries and on ships at sea, selects news, sports, sitcoms, 
movies, specials and a variety of programming from the broadcast and cable 
networks. Extra news coverage of disasters such as the Northridge earthquake 
are picked up from the major broadcast networks and CNN and transmitted by 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 With a limited budget, which is diminishing with military cutbacks, the 
broadcast center relies on the patriotism of networks and producers to donate 
their products. 
</P>
<P>
 Some religious broadcasters go even further to accommodate Armed Forces 
Network needs. For instance, Pat Robertson's "700 Club" is pared down to a 
half-hour by his Family Channel editors and the Rev. Robert Schuller's "Hour of 
Power," the top-rated syndicated religious program in this country, is edited 
down to 30 minutes by technicians at the Crystal Cathedral, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "White Heat," the Christian metal program produced by broadcaster Ken Roberts 
of Torrance, is done free of charge solely for the military network. So is 
"Love on a Rock" (top hits) and "Amen Corner" (black gospel). 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't hear these programs anywhere else," said Smith, 38, a United 
Methodist minister who is halfway through his three-year assignment at the 
broadcast center. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a chaplain, I don't want to play the ratings game, but if the servicemen 
and women are not listening or watching, then we are not reaching them," he 
said. "The programmers overseas usually ran worship services and Bible study 
programs on Sunday morning -- when the people who might listen or watch were in 
chapel. We want to reach more than them." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that he changed the radio schedule to run some music programs for 
52 consecutive weeks -- instead of changing them every 13 weeks as before -- in 
order to build up a following. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the biggest concerns, however, are to balance programs for different 
religious faiths and ethnic groups and to assure that the spiritual 
exhortations do not include pleas for money. 
</P>
<P>
 On radio, "East of Eden," a Jewish program of music and talk, is offered at 
eight holiday times during the year. "Passages," an award-winning program with 
interviews of people whose faith helped them overcome traumatic experiences, is 
produced by the Presbyterian Media Mission in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 On television, "The Jesuit Journal" and "Catch the Spirit" offer interviews on 
current religious issues, from the Catholic and Methodist perspectives, 
respectively. When "Hour of Power" is not showing, the military network offers 
the upbeat "Outreach of Love" Sunday service from an African Methodist 
Episcopal church in Baltimore led by Pastor Frank Reid, formerly of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Network documentaries or specials on religious themes -- such as how churches 
and synagogues responded to Hurricane Andrew -- are picked up by the network. 
</P>
<P>
 Final approval of the program selections rests with a three-chaplain committee 
called the Audiovisual Advisory Group, but it is the religious program 
coordinator who searches program listings and monitors network feeds for new 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith picked up two television productions that focused on last September's 
Parliament of World Religions in Chicago -- a documentary from CBS and a series 
of interviews produced by the Faith & Values Cable Network featuring Hindu, 
Buddhist, Muslim, Bahai and other religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will really be beneficial because we have a very diverse audience," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 That very diversity means that the chaplain-coordinators have to review each 
program to make sure that no religious group is criticized or demeaned. The 
military programmers do not censor or edit programs, so the entire show has to 
be free of abusive references to meet government guidelines on fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got one complaint when I first came here that a program was unfair to a 
faith group, and when I looked at it, I had to agree," Smith said. "It turned 
out that was a program that went through the approval process in the three 
months between Maj. Davenport's assignment here and when I started."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ENROLLMENT FALLS BY 80 AT QUAKE-DAMAGED 
CALARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fewer than one in 10 students at earthquake-battered CalArts have withdrawn 
from the school, despite earlier concerns that $12 million to $15 million in 
campus damage would mean a drop in the quality of education. 
</P>
<P>
 According to preliminary figures Friday -- the final day that students could 
withdraw and receive a full refund of their $6,925 semester tuition -- about 80 
of the 964 students enrolled at the college have left. 
</P>
<P>
 In an average year, about 7% of the enrolled students withdraw, said Anita 
Bonnell, CalArts director of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a slightly higher amount of students appear to have left this semester, 
but some believe the 6.8-magnitude Northridge earthquake had a stronger effect 
on them than is now documented. 
</P>
<P>
 CalArts President Steven Lavine suggested 30 to 40 students might have 
abandoned their studies without officially withdrawing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are students that clearly just fled," Lavine said. "I think we'll find 
that out all semester. I think we'll find out there are students who paid their 
fees and registered, so we count them as enrolled (but who left))." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammered in the first week of the new semester by the Jan. 17 quake, CalArts 
twice extended the deadline for students to withdraw and get their money back. 
With limited access to CalArts' main building, courses have continued in an 
array of satellite classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fairly confident that through borrowed and rented facilities we could 
provide a serious education," Lavine said. "We wanted to give the students 
enough time to see that." 
</P>
<P>
 Art, film, critical studies and music composition classes are being held at a 
former Lockheed site in Valencia. Voice, speech and Tai Chi martial arts 
instruction are proceeding within the Valencia Industrial Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater classes have spread to facilities from the Vista Village shopping 
center to Magic Mountain. Dance courses are held at the Santa Clarita YMCA and 
a Pasadena studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that it's different," Lavine said. "We've gone from a 
campus where everything is at one site to where it's all over the Santa Clarita 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Lavine estimated the quake will cost the college up to $2 million for 
satellite classrooms and in lost tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the logistics nightmare, the majority of students apparently believe 
they can learn a lot at the school. An earlier petition that called for the 
college to refund up to one-third of the tuition because students would not get 
the education they had initially signed up to receive appears to have died. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, I think education is where you want it to be," said Wendell Seat, a 
22-year-old CalArts graduate student. "You learn what you want to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Quake damage has delayed shooting dates for Seat's film project -- scheduled 
to have begun Jan. 17 -- and postponed editing classes. But Seat said fewer 
students has meant greater access to instructors and the equipment that is 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
 In only his first year at the college, Seat said he has no plans to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't like to quit, I guess."

LILLEHAMMER: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; HARDING RAISES NEW QUESTIONS; FIGURE SKATING: 
SHE HAS DIFFICULTY IN PRACTICE, THEN AVOIDS QUERIES ABOUT THE ATTACK ON 
KERRIGAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Tonya Harding tried to use spin control at her first Norway news conference 
and restrict questions and comments to her skating, attention veered Friday 
from her legal situation to her physical condition and whether Harding will be 
able to skate in the Winter Olympics at all. 
</P>
<P>
 After observing Harding at practice in Hamar, one professional skating coach, 
Marie Millikan, told The Times, "I can tell something's wrong. She can't even 
stand on her landing leg." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding is experiencing pain in her right ankle. The U.S. Olympic Committee 
has until Monday to replace her if necessary with Michelle Kwan, 13, of 
Torrance, who arrived Thursday and is practicing in Lillestrom, near Oslo, 
where her coach pronounced her ready, willing and able. Competition for the 
women begins Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding quit practice early Friday but downplayed it later, saying, "I don't 
need to be ready right this second." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the landing leg of Nancy Kerrigan that a hired assailant set out to 
harm Jan. 6, after allegedly having been paid by Harding's ex-husband, Jeff 
Gillooly, to eliminate her top American rival. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the sale by Gillooly of film footage of a half-naked Harding that 
appeared on television and in newspapers, Harding, 23, said, "I am very upset 
and I am ashamed. I'm embarrassed. The one thing I have to say is, if everyone 
could put themselves in my position, how would you feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a USA uniform during her 37-minute meeting with media, Harding sat 
with her coach, Diane Rawlinson, to whom she deflected many questions. Harding 
had requested that her attorney also be at her side during the news conference, 
but USOC officials said they would grant her no privileges denied other 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 After fielding a few routine questions from a USOC spokeswoman, Harding 
appeared stunned by the first question from the floor. A New York Times 
reporter asked of Harding that, because she had "lied" about everything from 
smoking cigarettes to what she originally had told the FBI of her knowledge of 
the crime against Kerrigan and had even reportedly flunked polygraph tests, 
"Why should we believe anything you say now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rawlinson rushed to Harding's rescue with, "We're here to talk about Tonya's 
skating." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was nevertheless pressed for a response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with my coach," she finally said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other inquiries went unanswered, Harding calling the questions 
inappropriate. Among the non-skating issues Harding did address was to confirm 
that the American television program "Inside Edition" had signed the skater to 
an exclusive contract for an unspecified sum and that the Oregon-based Nike 
sporting-goods conglomerate also had donated funds to Harding, reportedly 
$25,000 that will go toward coaching expenses and legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 At mention of her having skipped the Winter Olympics' opening ceremony for the 
second time, Harding and her coach contended that a U.S. team leader had 
requested that the skater stay away. Harding viewed the Feb. 12 ceremony on 
television at her home in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how she felt, whether she was hurting inside, Harding replied, 
"Sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 However else she is hurting is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding clutched her right ankle in pain after one awkward landing during 
practice. Millikan, who has no athletes here but is working for the Associated 
Press, observed the difficulties Harding was having with her landing leg, even 
on routine maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 On one triple loop, Millikan said, "She came down really hard. She did it 
perfectly, but then she stepped off the ice and grabbed her ankle. It's 
absolutely hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, something is definitely bothering her. Some of the jumps, she 
just can't handle." 
</P>
<P>
 The skater expressed no concern that she will be unfit to compete. The reason 
she and her coach called off practice prematurely was because, Harding said, "I 
want to be perfect and I wasn't. We just decided I was done." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kwan, who was runner-up to Harding at the national championships 
last month in Detroit, is ready to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michelle skated great today, just great," one eyewitness told The Times. 
"She's ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding did not allude to Kerrigan here Friday except to say, "We both give 
each other respect on the ice. . . . I have a great deal of respect for Nancy." 
</P>
<P>
 She did acknowledge what she described as a "brief encounter" between them in 
the Olympic village two days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harding: "It was very positive. We said hello. It's kind of a private 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Randy Harvey contributed to this story from Hamar.

CARBAJAL JABS AT 'EXCUSES'; BOXING: CHAMPION VOWS PUNCHING POWER WILL TAKE OUT 
HUMBERTO GONZALEZ AGAIN IN REMATCH TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 No retreats, few regrets, one rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March 13, Michael Carbajal arose from the canvas twice to score a 
seventh-round knockout of Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a battle of light-flyweight champions that scorched the Las Vegas 
Hilton ring and allowed Carbajal to retain his International Boxing Federation 
title and take the World Boxing Council version from Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 5 p.m. Las Vegas-quality fight card today at the Forum that also features 
an attractive grudge match between IBF lightweight champion Freddie Pendleton 
and No. 1 contender Rafael Ruelas of Sylmar, the Carbajal-Gonzalez rematch 
dominates. 
</P>
<P>
 Can this bout, probably Los Angeles' biggest in 15 years, possibly be as good 
as their first? And how does Gonzalez, who controlled most of the fight until 
he was floored by a dramatic Carbajal left hook, avoid another Carbajal crash 
course this time? 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez (37-2, 26 knockouts) blames a poor training regimen for the loss and 
has come into this fight looking trimmer, sounding surer and explaining that 
his mediocre conditioning exposed him in the middle rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 He weighed in Friday night at 107 1/4 pounds, a half-pound lighter than 
Carbajal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I expect another war," Gonzalez said this week. "I expect to win. And 
that's why I've prepared like I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said his strategy of aggressively forcing Carbajal backward worked in 
the first fight, as long as Gonzalez had the energy to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carbajal is a slugger; he's not a boxer," Gonzalez said. "Many people say 
he's a boxer. Maybe he used to be a boxer, but not any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's going to change. I think he is going to come to fight, 
like he did last time. And I personally think he is going to try to do the same 
thing because the last time he won by knockout. If he does the same thing, I 
will win by knockout." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez points to his comeback from a shocking knockout loss to Rolando 
Pascua at the Forum in December 1990. Gonzalez lost the WBC title on that day, 
but regained it six months later by defeating Melchor Cob Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carbajal camp scoffs at Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez will get knocked out this time exactly for the same reasons he was 
knocked out last time, the Carbajals say: Because Carbajal (30-0, 18 KOs) hit 
Gonzalez harder than he hit Carbajal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time anybody loses, they always have an excuse," Carbajal said. "I don't 
pay attention to it. He got tired because I made him get tired -- because we 
were throwing punches from the beginning of the first round. That's why he got 
tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weight problems or not, it doesn't matter, I'm still going to make him get 
tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides said the Forum crowd, expected to be between 12,000 and 14,000, 
generating a California-record gate, will be heavily pro-Gonzalez. Gonzalez is 
a Mexican national who is promoted by the Forum and has had seven of his last 
13 bouts there. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 Carbajal fans from his hometown of Phoenix are expected at the 
Forum, but Gonzalez adviser Rafael Mendoza said he thinks the Forum will be 
"90% for Chiquita." 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs the crowd, I know him," Mendoza said of Gonzalez. "He is better when 
the crowd pushes him." 
</P>
<P>
 But Danny Carbajal, Michael's brother and trainer, said the crowd's roars 
might work against Gonzalez, whose only hope, he claimed, is to stay away from 
his brother's inside power. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if he tries to box and move around and not come in at Michael, his fans 
are going to boo the hell out of him," Danny Carbajal said. "They're going to 
say to him, 'Hey, you're from Mexico, you better get in there.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure is on him. He's going to have to stand and fight. That's to 
Michael's advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 In the featured undercard fight, the 31-year-old Pendleton (35-18-4, 23 KOs) 
is making the second defense of a title he won in early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton, 18-3-1 in his last 22 fights, including a disqualification for 
failing to return to his corner in a non-title bout last December against Ed 
Pollard, has come from Miami talking loudly and carrying a load of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton's first title defense was a decision over Jorge Paez, who had 
earlier been knocked out by Ruelas, and possibly his best losing effort 
occurred when he was decisioned by then-IBF and WBC lightweight champion 
Pernell Whitaker on Feb. 3, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 22-year-old Ruelas (39-1, 31 KOs), this is a contest between his youth 
and considerable punching power, and Pendleton's quickness and savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both weighed in at 135 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the card: Paez (50-6-4, 34 KOs) vs. Andres Sandoval (41-16-1, 36 KOs) 
in a lightweight bout, and Scotty Olson (28-1, 22 KOs) vs. Jorge Roman (15-9-2, 
8 KOs) in a flyweight bout.

LILLEHAMMER: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; JANSEN LAYS HIS GHOSTS TO REST; SPEEDSKATING: 
THEY EMERGE WHEN HE SLIPS DURING THE 1,000 METERS, BUT THIS TIME HE DOESN'T 
PANIC.

<P>
 When U.S. speedskater Dan Jansen slipped while emerging from the next-to-last 
curve in Friday's 1,000-meter race, ghosts of Olympics past flashed by his 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 That included a particularly horrifying one from last Monday, when a similar 
error in the curve at the other end of the Olympic Hall track diverted him from 
his gold-medal pace in the 500 meters and sent him into eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, he recalled advice that his coach, Peter Mueller, had 
given him moments before the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me, 'Don't panic. Don't try to get it back too fast,' " Jansen said. 
"So I just thought about holding it together and staying relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 He did, not only winning the elusive gold medal but setting a world record, 1 
minute 12.43 seconds. It was the third world record set during the first week 
of the Winter Olympics on a track that is enhancing its reputation as the 
world's fastest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen, 28, of Greenfield, Wis., became the first man to skate the 500 meters 
under 36 seconds, doing it twice in the same weekend on this track in December, 
and then did it twice more recently in Calgary, Canada, establishing himself as 
the overwhelming favorite for that race here. 
</P>
<P>
 But his Olympic trials and tribulations, which began in Calgary in 1988 when 
he fell in both the 500 and the 1,000 after learning of the death from leukemia 
of his sister, seemed fated to continue here after Monday's disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finished fourth in the 500 in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, 
France, he followed that with a lackadaisical 26th-place finish in the 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I deep down didn't feel I had a chance in the 1,000," he said Friday of his 
Albertville experience. "After the 500, I took off a couple of days and didn't 
feel like skating." 
</P>
<P>
 He vowed, however, that he would not quit this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Speedskating experts remained skeptical about his chances, for reasons having 
little to do with his previous Olympic collapses. Although he set the track 
record of 1:13.01 in December, seven other men in Friday's race had skated 
faster, including Canadian Kevin Scott, who held the world record of 1:12.54. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular throughout the world because of his perseverance and his polite, 
soft-spoken demeanor, Jansen was the fan favorite as many among the capacity 
crowd of 12,000, including flag-waving, cowbell-carrying Norwegians, chanted 
his initials, "D.J., D.J., D.J." 
</P>
<P>
 But the favorite among the experts was the once-dominant Igor Zhelezovsky, who 
now, nearing retirement, doubles as president of Belarus' fledgling 
speedskating association. Scott was entered here, but not expected to contend 
because of a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhelezovsky skated in the first pair with Russia's Sergei Klevchenya, the 
silver medalist in the 500, and both broke the previous Olympic record, 
Zhelezovsky finishing in 1:12.72 and Klevchenya in 1:12.85. 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen, who skated in the fourth pair, believed then that he was going for the 
bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds strange, but I wasn't real confident going to the line because I 
didn't feel like I was gripping the ice," he said. "I said, 'Don't push the 
turn hard because you're going to slip.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That, indeed, is what occurred, but he was able to maintain his balance by 
touching his hand to the ice. More important, he maintained his composure. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 36 competitors who skated after him, no one came within a second of 
his time. Zhelezovsky finished second, Klevchenya third. Scott finished was 
10th in 1:13.82. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked a few minutes after he finished his race what he was thinking when he 
saw the world-record time flashing on the scoreboard by his name, he said, "I 
don't even know. I was shaking. I guess my first thought was, 'Finally, it's 
happened for me.' 
</P>
<P>
 "People expected me to win the 500, but not the 1,000. It worked out strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at a news conference that was interrupted by congratulatory phone calls 
from President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jansen said: "The whole day 
has yet to sink in, what happened and why it happened. It's a dream. It's 
something special that I can't put into words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm probably happier for my family than I am for me. They have 
been coming to the Olympics with me, and I was supposed to win, and when I 
didn't, they couldn't celebrate. We'll celebrate tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 As for those who doubted him, he said, "I don't have anything to say. If they 
doubted me, they didn't know anything about skating. That means they've only 
been around at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had so many world records, world championships and World Cup victories. 
This was the only thing left for me to do." 
</P>
<P>
 One person who never doubted him was his favorite singer, Jimmy Buffett. 
</P>
<P>
 He sent Jansen a telegram Thursday night that said, simply, "Blow the 
Volcano." 
</P>

<P>
 Every day I wake up thinking Tonya Harding is going to pop out of a hole like 
a groundhog, which means six more weeks of Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya, Tonya, Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
 I came 8,000 miles and nine time zones to watch the Olympics, and I just can't 
write another whole story about this woman today, OK? Maybe tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya, Tonya, Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers even wrote letters to my editor, accusing me of having a crush on her. 
</P>
<P>
 A crush on her? At times I wish an avalanche would crush her. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya, Tonya, Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
 My assignment Friday was her first big photo-op, fire-away, 
hit-me-with-your-best-shot news conference. You know, here I am, Tonya Harding, 
love me, hate me, hold me, thrill me, hallelujah, let's all get happy, we're 
gonna chase all the blues away. 
</P>
<P>
 I went. I took down every word. I heard Tonya's voice, but saw her coach's 
mouth move. I haven't seen ventriloquism like this since Edgar Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a cute act, I'll give them that. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya sits to Diane Rawlinson's right. Ten cents says she can't talk while 
Rawlinson is sipping a glass of water. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like watching a bad beauty pageant. Tonya is 23, but the questions are 
just too, too tough for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya, have you been able to focus on your goal?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been able to focus on my goal because . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Tonya, Tonya, Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya, if you could be any tree . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Nah. Never mind. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's this new bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Any time she's cornered, Tonya now mentions God or country. Which is fine, 
except since everyone first began following Tonya Harding in figure skating, 
the number of times she mentioned God or country before this February came to 
somewhere in the general vicinity of zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, wow. This kid doesn't miss a trick. She's here because she wants 
to win one for the ol' US of A, one nation, under God, indivisible, with 
liberty and justice and it's a grand old flag, it's a high-flying flag. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, the woman sat here Friday and said she's made an arrangement with this 
litter box of a TV show called "Inside Edition" and you know what she said she 
would do with some of the money? Institute a "Tonya Harding Trust Fund for 
Special Olympics in Oregon," said her incredible self, Tonya Harding, bless her 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Any day now, I promise you, this woman is going to adopt a stray Norwegian 
puppy. 
</P>
<P>
 So, enough about her. No more today. 
</P>
<P>
 I have some unfinished business. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Dan Jansen and he has had the longest run of bad luck of anybody 
since David Janssen, the old TV fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the sweetest guy on skates and he has been trying to win one for his 
country for 10 years. His wife wears a little American flag sticker on her 
cheek and his baby daughter bounces on her mommy's knee wearing a bib that 
reads, "Go, Daddy, Go!" 
</P>
<P>
 And he won the 1,000 meters in Olympic speedskating Friday in world-record 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to every race Dan raced in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. Didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to every race Dan raced in Calgary, Canada. Didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to every race Dan raced in Albertville, France. Didn't win. I went to 
Dan's first race in Norway. Didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, I missed Dan's race because I had to go hear what Tonya had to say. 
Tonya, Tonya, Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
 I came 8,000 miles and nine time zones and missed it. 
</P>
<P>
 What I'd like to say is that I love the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 But someone will accuse me of having a crush on him.

LANGSTON SEEKS NEW DEAL BY APRIL; BASEBALL: PITCHER HAS TOLD THE ANGELS HE 
WANTS A CONTRACT EXTENSION BEFORE SEASON OPENS, OR THEY RISK LOSING HIM TO FREE 
AGENCY.

<P>
 The Angels have been notified that they must sign All-Star pitcher Mark 
Langston to a contract extension by opening day or risk losing him to free 
agency when the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first and foremost priority is to stay with the Angels," Langston said, 
"but I'd like to have this resolved by the time we get going (April 5).If it's 
not done by then, I'll just play it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want my contract to be a distraction to myself or my teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi: "I think that's fair. We'd like to 
either get it done by then, or say, 'We've done all that we can do . . .' We're 
definitely interested in doing something." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are expected to resume negotiations next week, and requested a 
meeting with Langston's agent, Arn Tellem. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope is that something will happen early in spring training," Tellem said. 
"I'm cautiously optimistic and hopeful that they realize what he means to the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark is happy here and wants to stay, but if it gets to the beginning of the 
season and nothing's happened, they'll have to wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, in the final year of a five-year, $16-million contract, has a clause 
that prohibits him from being traded without his permission. He rejected trade 
proposals this winter from the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox.

 Gerard Agostinello and his wife have jogged past the intersection in Amity 
Harbor, N.Y., for the past five years. But it wasn't until last Wednesday that 
they looked up at the street signs and made an Olympian discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Look, it's Harding,' " Gerard recalled. "And my wife said, 'Look, 
it's Kerrigan.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan have been doing their best to avoid 
each other at the Winter Games, Harding and Kerrigan roads have been meeting 
for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The street signs are half-buried in a snowbank, but Kerrigan clearly stands 
above Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's hope it goes that way in the Olympics," Agostinello said. 
</P>
<P>
 News at 10: While waiting for Judge Patrick D. Gilroy to emerge from the 
Clackamas County Courthouse, where Tonya Harding and the U.S. Olympic Committee 
reached a settlement last week, two Oregonians on mountain bikes approached a 
reporter, asking if she was still in the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya's not here," the reporter replied. "She didn't bother coming to court, 
just her attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya?" the men asked. "We want to see Connie Chung."

 Trivia time: Who is the only college basketball coach to take four different 
universities to the NCAA tournament?

<P>
 Taxing work: Spy magazine recently calculated how much certain athletes impact 
the price of tickets and merchandise through what it calls a Fabulousness-Added 
Tax. Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
 "Doug Drabek: Earned $1.30 on every $12 Houston Astros ticket in 1993; won 
nine games and lost 18. Also choked away 2-0 lead to Atlanta Braves in ninth 
inning of Game 7 of 1992 National League Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrick Ewing: Earned $6.56 on top New York Knicks ticket in 1992-93; . . . 
usually AWOL during the big games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby Bonilla: Raked in $1.05 on every $15 New York Mets ticket in 1993; led 
team to worst record in majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Jordan: Eked out a meager $1.40 from the low-end ticket and only 
$22.20 from the courtside seat; led the (Chicago Bulls) to three championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne Gretzky: Pocketed from 89 cents to $24.93 a head from L.A. Kings fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Sign of the times: Philadelphia Phillies catcher Darren Daulton, in the first 
year of a four-year, $18.5-million guaranteed contract, might be distracted 
this spring when he is at the plate or behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 Daulton's wife, Lynne Austin-Daulton, has filed for divorce and is seeking a 
"lump-sum alimony" of everything Daulton owns and everything the couple has 
acquired jointly since they were married in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation figures to be on Daulton's mind. A restaurant chain has renewed 
an advertising billboard featuring Lynne Austin-Daulton on the center-field 
fence of the Phillies' training stadium in Clearwater, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kidd is a natural: Michael Jordan won three NBA championships before he 
decided to give baseball a try. California guard Jason Kidd said he won't be 
waiting as long. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, a sophomore, wants to play outfield, catch or be the designated hitter 
for the Bear baseball team when basketball season ends.  
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't for fun," Kidd said. 'I take everything seriously. But I know 
people won't take me seriously . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to play baseball. Baseball comes way before the NBA."

LILLEHAMMER: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; JONES PUTS BRAKES ON ATTEMPT BY SHIMER TO 
REPLACE HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Jones, a former Duke football captain who has been Brian Shimer's pusher 
and brakeman for the last two years, will remain in that capacity when two-man 
bobsled competition begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second of two training runs Thursday, Shimer, dissatisfied with his 
start times this season, had switched to former UCLA football player Jeff 
Woodard, the pusher for driver Randy Will. 
</P>
<P>
 Will was eliminated in a race-off for the two U.S. berths in two-man by Shimer 
and Jim Herberich, leaving Woodard available. Under the federation's selection 
criteria, however, Jones had the right to veto the change and did so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if Brian and the coaches felt a change was in order, we couldn't do it," 
said David Kurtz, assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Did they feel a change was in order? Obviously. Woodard had already been 
registered as Shimer's brakeman and the U.S. federation could only change back 
to Jones if Woodard had an injury. Now, conveniently, he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're calling it a strained quad(riceps)," said Kurtz, who added that Shimer 
has to use Jones in next week's race-off for four-man because Woodard is part

 "Brian has been distracted through all of this because he wanted to assemble 
the best two-man team he can," Kurtz said. "However, he's also putting a 
positive spin on it. He just wants to do the best he can." ROSS NEWHAN

LILLEHAMMER: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; TOMBA'S ARRIVAL COMES WITH TYPICAL BOMBAST; 
SLALOM: SKI STAR REGALES MEDIA WITH FUNNY OPINIONS, INCLUDING CHANGING CITY'S 
NAME TO 'LILLE-TOMBA.'

 When Alberto Tomba hits town, you can almost hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old Italian slalom star arrived at the Winter Olympics Thursday, 
accompanied by his usual entourage -- photographers, a personal cook, trainers, 
admirers. 
</P>
<P>
 And one bottle of red wine. Tomba wouldn't say whether it was for a victory 
toast. 
</P>
<P>
 He will try to become the first skier to win a gold medal in three consecutive 
Olympic Games. He won the slalom and giant slalom at Calgary in 1988, and 
repeated in GS in 1992 at Albertville. 
</P>
<P>
 First, though, a little fun. The renegade playboy, known for his fast cars and 
insatiable thirsts, fielded questions here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He revealed that 24 phone messages were awaiting him when he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a sex symbol to do? 
</P>
<P>
 At Calgary, Tomba suggested that Canada rename the province Alberta to 
"Alberto" in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, he suggested the "Albertoville Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 What about Norway? 
</P>
<P>
 "Lille-Tomba," Alberto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan saga, Tomba said: "In Italy, if 
that happened, if someone would hit me, I would just hit back." 
</P>
<P>
 A very nervous, female Japanese reporter, trying to get the jump on the 1998 
Winter Games at Nagano, asked Tomba about the cook who travels with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba responded: "I'll cook spaghetti for you in Nagano." 
</P>
<P>
 In a second of seriousness, Tomba did reaffirm that these would be his last 
Olympics, that he would go to Nagano only as a tourist. Tomba said he has 
become more diligent about his work over the years, and that he will, on 
occasion, look at his three gold medals for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when I feel like winning, I will look at them again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba still has a few days to prepare for his events, Wednesday's giant slalom 
at Hafjell, and the slalom there Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm more serious than I used to be," he said. "I laugh because you 
have to laugh. Otherwise, you don't win." CHRIS DUFRESNE

LILLEHAMMER: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; HOCKEY TEAM TRIES AGAIN FOR VICTORY; HOCKEY: 
SWEDEN'S PUCK-POSSESSION GAME AND STRONG DEFENSE PRESENT A STIFFER CHALLENGE 
THAN U.S. HAS FACED IN THREE TIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Having perfected the art of tying games, the U.S. Olympic hockey team felt no 
need to practice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, Coach Tim Taylor gave his players a day off to spend with friends 
and families. With a game today against Sweden, the tournament's second-seeded 
team and Group B co-leader at 2-0-1, Friday figured to be their last chance to 
relax for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Good fortune, favorable calls and desperation on the power play allowed them 
to rally for ties in their first three games against France, Slovakia and 
Canada. They will need all those factors and more against Sweden, which blends 
playmaking and intelligent defense in a high-paced, dynamic style. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States was 0-1-2 in pre-Olympic play against Sweden, including a 
3-3 tie in their last meeting, Feb. 9 at Goteborg, Sweden. Their most recent 
Olympic encounter was a 3-3 tie at Albertville in 1992. No American team has 
beaten Sweden in the Olympics since a 6-3 victory in 1960 at Squaw Valley. 
Sweden holds a 3-0-2 edge since then. 
</P>
<P>
 "They play a puck-possession game and they also, when they don't have the 
puck, clog up the neutral zone very well and play a strong defensive system 
that all the players are committed to," Taylor said. "You go into this knowing, 
No. 1, offensively you're not going to have the puck a lot and, No. 2, when you 
do have the puck, you're going to be facing a formidable defensive system. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "You try, obviously, to be very good defensively. You go into the game knowing 
Sweden is probably going to have the puck more than we are. We have to have a 
good game plan against their neutral-zone trap. France was actually doing 
something similar to what I think we'll see from Sweden." 
</P>
<P>
 Following Taylor's preordained plan, goaltender Mike Dunham, who started the 
tournament-opening 4-4 tie with France but backed up Garth Snow in the next two 
games, will be back in goal today. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems a curious decision, made by calculation rather than reacting to 
circumstances. Snow, who has five games of NHL experience, played exceptionally 
well against Canada, stopping a penalty shot and blunting a dangerous 
two-on-one chance in the waning minutes. Snow also has been a calming presence 
for the young American team in the last two games, with 59 saves in 65 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor had said before the Games that he might stick with one goalie instead 
of alternating if one became hot, and it's difficult to be hotter than Snow was 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Dunham, who at 21 is three years younger than Snow and lacks his 
teammate's NHL experience, acknowledged he was nervous against France and might 
have played better. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor became defensive when questioned about his choice and said the change 
was not a condemnation of Snow's play, but an expression of confidence in both 
goalies. He cited Dunham's strong past play against Sweden. Dunham saved 64 of 
68 shots in the last two games, a loss to Sweden's B team and the 2-2 tie with 
a squad that will strongly resemble today's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mike is a very capable and confident goaltender and I don't think he 
plays defensively. . . ," Taylor said. "I told you all along we have two 
goalies who are very capable of starting each game."

LILLEHAMMER: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER; JANSEN'S GOLD RUSH 
REDUCES CYNICS TO SOFTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sportswriters are not a particularly disciplined lot. Cynical, yes; 
disciplined, no. But there is one rule they generally follow: No cheering in 
the press box. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was that outburst Friday afternoon among the cynics in the main press 
center here? It sounded remarkably like a cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it sounded remarkably like the cheer that resounded one February 
Friday night in 1980 at Lake Placid, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen years ago, the cheer was for the U.S. hockey team, which had just 
beaten the heavily favored Soviets on its remarkable journey to a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the cheer was for Dan Jansen, who had just completed his own 
remarkable journey to a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, even the no-cheering rule doesn't apply. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever there was a gold-medal kid, it's Jansen. Genuine, down-home friendly, 
the world's best sprinter for the last decade or so, he had won everything 
worth winning in speedskating except an Olympic medal. And his Olympic failures 
had been spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in 1988, when he skated as a tribute to his sister, who had just died of 
leukemia, he fell. In 1992, he skated too cautiously in one race and ran out of 
gas in the other. And Monday, while on a world-record pace, he had bobbled 
again in his specialty, the 500-meter race. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Jansen toed the starting line in Hamar, for the last time in four 
Olympics, the cynics harbored no illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't watch," one said, turning away. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't not watch," said another. "It's like witnessing a car accident." 
</P>
<P>
 "Which corner do you think it will be?" asked the biggest cynic of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Jansen was off, skates flashing, again on a world-record pace. The cynics 
held their breath. When he bobbled again slightly, it happened so fast that 
nobody knew how close to disaster he had come until they showed the replays. 
</P>
<P>
 And only a little more than a minute after he had set off, Jansen roared 
across the finish line, the record and the gold medal his. Finally. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the cheering erupted.  
</P>
<P>
 And later, when Jansen stood teary-eyed on the winner's podium, gold medal 
around his neck, "The Star Spangled Banner" playing, he wasn't the only one who 
was teary-eyed. MIKE KUPPER

OWNER, DRIVER AND A MEETING OF MIND; AUTO RACING: DARRELL WALTRIP GETS FASTER 
AT THE TRACK HE LOVES TO HATE WHEN HE STOPS BEING A 'GOOD BUDDY' IN THE SHOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been 12 years since Darrell Waltrip won the last of his three Winston 
Cup championships, six years since he won his only Daytona 500 and more than a 
year since he won a Winston Cup race anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned 47 two weeks ago and has been in 21 Daytona 500s in a row -- more 
consecutive starts than any other driver in Sunday's field. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does he think of his chances? 
</P>
<P>
 "I firmly believe that this is the best team I've ever had, even including the 
ones in years when I won 12 races," he said. "We (had the sixth-fastest car) 
but ran into some bad luck Thursday when the Hoosier tires didn't do the job 
the way we thought they would. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be back on Goodyears for Sunday's race, and I expect to be back where 
we were when we had the best winter I'd ever had testing at Daytona and 
Talladega (in Alabama)." 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran driver from Franklin, Tenn., was speaking as both owner and driver 
of the gleaming No. 17 Western Auto Chevrolet Lumina he will start in 32nd 
position in Sunday's race. "My rule of thumb at Daytona has been if I qualify 
well, I run well," Waltrip said. "I qualified well, but I didn't run well 
Thursday. But I know why and we've taken care of the problem. I don't see any 
problem in running from where we start. It just means getting through more 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when Waltrip won the 500, he had qualified second. But there is 
precedent for winning from as far back as Waltrip will start. Bobby Allison won 
from 33rd in 1978 and Benny Parsons from 32nd in 1975. More recently, Bill 
Elliott started 38th and won the Firecracker 400 at Daytona in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Waltrip also finished second in 1979 and third three years in a row from 
1984-86. He has also won five Twin 125 heat races, five Busch Grand Nationals, 
one IROC and one Busch Clash at Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell the truth, I have a love-hate relationship with Daytona," Waltrip 
said. "I love to win here, but I hate the price I've had to pay. Of all the 
tracks I've been to in my racing career, none holds a light to Daytona (in) the 
bodily harm it's done to me through the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The accidents seem to run in cycles. From '83 to '89, I had some pretty good 
luck here. Then, from '90 on, it's been a battle." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he formed his own Winston Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he was involved in accidents during both the Daytona 500 and the 
Goody's 300 Grand National, then had the worst accident of his career during 
the 1991 Firecracker 400 in July when his car was destroyed when it flipped 
across the wet infield grass. Waltrip sustained a black eye and multiple 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 When he left Rick Hendrick's team to form his own, most NASCAR observers shook 
their heads in dismay. Other drivers, notably Bobby Allison, Buddy Baker, Cale 
Yarborough and even Richard Petty, had tried to run owner-driver teams and all 
had failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had been a stigma that you couldn't do both successfully, but I think 
that was more because all of them were underfinanced," Waltrip explained. 
"Sponsors were leery of backing them, but when we got Western Auto behind us, I 
felt we were ready for big things." 
</P>
<P>
 Big things happened for a while -- he won two races in 1991 and three in '92, 
including the Southern 500 at Darlington, S.C. -- but 1993 was a loser. He not 
only didn't win, he had only two finishes as high as third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was a major learning year for the owner," he said. "When things 
started going sour, I began to doubt my ability as a driver, but friends, even 
racing competitors, told me the problem was with the owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally got it through my head that I was operating my team on the 'good 
buddy syndrome.' When I was not at the shop, performance dropped. When I was 
there, things were OK, but I couldn't be around all the time. The answer was to 
clean house, get a new guy (Clyde Booth, who had been with Kenny Bernstein's 
team) to run the shop and get tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Waltrip also sold his Grand National, ARCA and All-Pro cars to concentrate on 
one thing -- regaining his Winston Cup success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny how different the driver mentality is from the owner mentality," 
he said. "I should have learned from running for Junior (Johnson) and Rick 
(Hendrick) that when you try to run two teams, instead of ending up with one 
great team, you more likely end up with two mediocre ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just aren't enough hours in a day to do both and do them right." 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors sometimes mentioned as contributing to Waltrip's slump have been 
age, a growing family and the inability to say no to outside commercial 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Waltrip's responses: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On age: "Sure, I have to think about it. I'm no fool. I know I have to work 
harder to compete with guys 25 to 35. I used to be that age myself, and I know 
how I felt, but I think the way I work out, I'm as fit physically as ever. It 
just means more time from the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was younger, 40 seemed like an age to retire. I was winning races and 
winning championships, but the pressure on me to win made it very difficult for 
me. I never thought I could take it for 20 years. I was always battling 
something -- race politics, my car owners, other drivers, the media, the fans. 
It was something all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, I woke up to realize I couldn't win every race, that I couldn't 
worry about the ones I didn't win. It didn't make losing any easier, but it put 
it in a different perspective. That's when I knew I could keep doing this for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On his family -- wife Stevie and daughters Jessica, 7, and Sarah, 1 1/2: 
"My family is the kind you long to work for. It gives me more focus, but it's 
easy for a race driver -- and a race car owner -- to fill his time working to 
make the car better. What I have to do is be sure they get from me what they 
need. That, and a lot of love, which is the easiest to give." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On off-track activity: "I'm the first to admit I like to be out in front. 
It's part of my personality, but there is a limit to how many balls you can 
keep in the air. I hate to say no to an opportunity. . . . There are so many 
more opportunities now than there were a few years ago. Somewhere, you have to 
turn some down, but that's a whole lot better alternative than not having any 
offers." 
</P>
<P>
 An added emotional burden this week for every driver is the memory of Neil 
Bonnett and Rodney Orr, who were killed in accidents during practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wake up in the morning with a knot in my stomach and a heavy heart, and I 
go around all day feeling like that," Waltrip said. "You can't get away from 
it. No one here can. The worst part is when you're off the track. You have more 
time to reflect on it. Your mind thinks of all the 'what ifs?' and there's 
nothing you can do."

EARNHARDT KEEPS UNSER BEHIND IN RACE OF CHAMPIONS VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four NASCAR drivers took turns drafting one another into and out of the lead 
in the opening race of International Race of Champions XVIII on Friday at 
Daytona International Speedway, but when pole-sitter Dale Earnhardt streaked 
toward the finish, it was Indy car veteran Al Unser Jr. he had to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 22nd victory for Earnhardt at Daytona, although he has never won 
the Daytona 500, a lapse he will seek to remedy Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, Rusty Wallace, Mark Martin and Dale Jarrett all led during the 
40-lap race for 12 of the country's leading drivers in identically prepared 
Dodge Avengers. Unser was the only non-Winston Cup driver to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Dodge was the best Dodge on the last lap because it got real wide right 
then," a smiling Earnhardt said. "I flat-out had to block Little Al. That 
rascal's tough. He'd be a champion in NASCAR the way he is in Indy cars if he 
raced with us." 
</P>
<P>
 World of Outlaw champion Steve Kinser, who races winged sprint cars and had 
never competed in the IROC, was a surprising seventh, second behind Unser among 
non-NASCAR drivers unfamiliar with high-banked superspeedway racing. SHAV GLICK

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; STRAWBERRY SAYS HE'S READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry, talking to reporters on the opening day of training camp at 
Vero Beach, Fla., looked up to see a group of players from Japan's Waseda 
University approaching the batting cages. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's my new team," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the controversy surrounding Strawberry off the field, there has 
been speculation that the Dodgers might try to trade him this spring. But Fred 
Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said Friday that if Strawberry is 
productive, he will stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he hits 20 home runs or more and drives in 100 runs or more, I'm not 
willing to let that pass," Claire said. "I have nothing but positive thoughts 
about it. He has worked hard, he is swinging well and he is highly motivated. 
If he isn't motivated now, I don't know when he would be." 
</P>
<P>
 There remain some unresolved issues that could affect Strawberry, including an 
ongoing investigation by the IRS of allegedly non-reported income from baseball 
card shows. But Claire said he is not expecting bad news, although he is 
willing to react to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry said he is physically sound and would like to finish his career in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Ramon Martinez was the only no-show, and Claire wasn't happy about it. 
When he found out that Martinez wasn't here, he called the club's baseball 
academy in the Dominican Republic and discovered him there, preparing to pitch 
in an intrasquad game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he felt fine and was in a good frame of mind, which is better than 
what I was in," Claire said. "I told him I was glad he felt good, but I thought 
it would be in his best interest if he were here feeling good." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who hadn't bothered to tell the club he wasn't coming, told Claire 
he had some personal business to handle and would arrive Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott, who had 25 saves and a 2.32 earned-run average while filling in for 
closer Todd Worrell last season, came to camp ready to challenge for the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is the team, but I think it is ridiculous that the subject 
hasn't been brought up," Gott said. "I love that job, and in three of my 10 
years I have proved I can do it. I think it's a nice problem for (Manager) Tom 
(Lasorda) to have." 
</P>
<P>
 The job, though, is Worrell's to lose, Lasorda said. MARYANN HUDSON

 The Sunkist Invitational indoor track meet, first rocked on Jan. 17 by the 
Northridge earthquake and battered again this week by two big-name dropouts, 
nonetheless will make its 35th go-around at the Sports Arena today. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Al Franken lost perhaps his best race Thursday when Olympic champion 
sprinter Gail Devers withdrew from the 50-meter race after being told that 
Russian sensation Irina Privalova had been added to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Franken said Devers' representatives wanted more appearance money than the 
agreed-to $9,000 to run against Privalova, which Devers' coach, Bob Kersee, 
didn't deny. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Franken lost miler Steve Scott. Still the American mile record-holder, 
Scott called in sick with flu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very rough go this year," Franken said of the meet he has 
promoted since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sports Arena was closed for 10 days for earthquake inspection, right 
after we'd started promoting the meet, and that certainly didn't help advance 
ticket sales. They even closed the box office." 
</P>
<P>
 For several days, before it was known whether the Sports Arena would be 
available, Franken secured alternate dates at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion and at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Franken said he hopes that Devers will reconsider and run against Privalova, 
and he plans to hold Devers' lane assignment open until race time, 7:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring more dropouts, these should be tonight's spotlighted events: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The women's 880, where Maria Mutola of Mozambique will chase Mary Decker 
Slaney's 14-year-old meet record of 1:59.7. Mutola ran a 2:02.85 half-mile in 
this meet last year and later won the indoor and outdoor world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The women's 50-meter hurdles, where Jackie Joyner-Kersee, two-time Olympic 
heptathlon champion, will face two athletes ranked among the top five U.S. 
hurdlers, Marsha Guialdo and Dawn Bowles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The decathlon hurdles and long jump, where 1993 world champion Dan O'Brien 
will begin his drive to a hoped-for 9,000-point decathlon later this year. He 
holds the world record of 8,891.  
</P>
<P>
 -- The featured miler will be Marcus O'Sullivan of Ireland, who has history's 
third-fastest indoor mile, 3:50.84, and three indoor world 1,500-meter 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The men's shotput, where Randy Barnes, outdoor (75-10 1/4) and indoor (74-4 
1/2) world record-holder, towers over the field.  
</P>
<P>
 The first event for about 1,500 high school athletes will be held at 11 a.m. 
and the meet will continue throughout the afternoon. Open competition starts at 
6 p.m. with the pole vault, and the first running event is set for 7:05 p.m.; 
the final race, the mile, starts at 9:55.

 The team has been notified that it must sign All-Star pitcher Mark Langston to 
a contract extension by opening day or risk losing him to free agency at 
season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first and foremost priority is to stay with the Angels," Langston said 
Friday, "but I'd like to have this resolved by the time we get going (on April 
5). If it's not done by then, I'll just play it out."

 Said Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi: "I think that's fair."

 Judge Robert O'Brien of the Los Angeles Superior Court has overturned a 
California Horse Racing Board order that would have limited the ability of the 
California Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn. to lobby public officials 
on issues affecting its membership. 
</P>
<P>
 At its last monthly meeting, the CHRB issued an order limiting the amount that 
could be spent on lobbying to 5% of the CHBPA's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Judge O'Brien's decision is good news, we have little time to revel in 
our victory," CHBPA President Chris Clark said in a prepared statement Friday. 
"Our political voice has been silenced since last November and, now that the 
judge has ruled in our favor, we need to quickly press on with our legislative 
agenda." BOB MIESZERSKI

SANTA ANITA; BENGAL BAY GIVES HIS NEW OWNERS MONEY'S WORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans of Bengal Bay shouldn't fret if they miss him in the $109,800 El Conejo 
Handicap today at Santa Anita. They may get a chance to see him again Monday in 
the $200,000 San Luis Obispo Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Barry Abrams, who has kept Bengal Bay busy since claiming him for 
$12,500 on Nov. 3, will run the son of Woodman in the 5 1/2-furlong El Conejo 
this afternoon after entering him this morning in the 1 1/2-mile San Luis 
Obispo on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Bengal Bay, who ran seven times in one 56-day period, competes in both 
races depends on a couple of factors. "We'll see how he comes out of the (El 
Conejo), but we won't run in the San Luis Obispo if Bien Bien runs," said 
Abrams, a former standardbred trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Bien Bien doesn't run, the field, except for Fanmore, isn't that strong. 
Most of them are $100,000 claimers in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Abrams' brother, David, and Vic Johnson, Bengal Bay has already 
proved to be a bargain buy. After winning only one of his first nine starts in 
1993 for owner 505 Farms and trainer Mark MacDonald, Bengal Bay has won three 
of seven for Abrams and earned $81,975 while moving up the claiming ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 In his most recent appearance, he beat $100,000 claimers by six lengths, six 
days after beating allowance horses by 1 1/4 lengths at 6 1/2 furlongs on the 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Running with minimal rest hasn't bothered the former $425,000 yearling 
purchase. He made his first three starts for Abrams in a span of nine days. 
After finishing fourth on Dec. 11 and Dec. 15, he won against $32,000 claimers 
on Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thrives on racing," said Abrams, who went out on his own with 
thoroughbreds last summer after serving as Roger Stein's assistant for nearly 
three years. "When he ran three times in nine days, his third race was the best 
of the three." 
</P>
<P>
 Highly regarded before his debut, Bengal Bay had basically been a bust through 
the first 16 races of his career and had worked his way down to the $12,500 
level, one step from the bottom at Santa Anita, when Abrams claimed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race when he broke his maiden (on Nov. 15, 1992) stuck in my mind," 
Abrams said. "He won going seven (furlongs by nearly two lengths in 1:21 3/5) 
and he showed the same burst of speed he did when he won the $100,000 claimer 
(on Feb. 5). 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure what I had, because he ran fourth the day I claimed him. 
Physically, he seemed OK, but he had some back problems. We worked with him, 
his back got looser and looser and he got more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 The late-running Bengal Bay is the co-sixth choice at 8-1 in the eight-horse 
El Conejo, which will mark his stakes debut. The 3-1 favorite is Scherando, 
third in the Palos Verdes Handicap behind Concept Win and J.F. Williams, who 
will skip this race, in his last start. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse can run any distance on any track," Abrams said. "That's the great 
thing about him. I wouldn't trade horses with anybody in this race. He's won 
three times in the last two months, and nobody else in there has won (since 
Nov. 27). 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse hasn't run to his best yet. I don't know how good he is. He's got 
the breeding and the class to be any kind of horse."

RAM NOTEBOOK / MIKE REILLEY; RAMS INTERESTED IN QUARTERBACK MITCHELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams have expressed interest in free-agent quarterback Scott Mitchell, 
although there has been no indication they are ready for serious contract 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the Rams have kicked the tires," said Tony Agnone, Mitchell's 
Maryland-based agent. "They have called me to inquire about him." 
</P>
<P>
 With quarterback Jim Everett on the trading block, the team has been 
interested in free agents such as Mitchell, who was with Miami last year, and 
Atlanta's Chris Miller. The team also could explore a trade for Indianapolis' 
Jeff George or Houston's Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warren grew up in Los Angeles and has roots here," said Leigh Steinberg, the 
Newport Beach-based agent for Moon and George, "so Anaheim is definitely an 
attractive place. But Houston has not privately told us they're ready to trade 
him. They would like to keep both quarterbacks (Moon and backup Cody Carlson)." 
</P>
<P>
 But can the Oilers foot the bill? Moon, 37, and Carlson, 30, make a combined 
$6.25 million a year, and the Oilers might have to trade one of them to free 
money under the new $33.8-million salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've read a lot of speculation," he said. "But Warren and Cody together don't 
make what Troy Aikman makes. They make right about what Steve Young makes. So 
it's not only possible, but probable, that Houston could keep both players." 
</P>
<P>
 George, 26, has grown unhappy while languishing in the Colts' offense the last 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are among 11 teams that have inquired about Mitchell, who became an 
unrestricted free agent when his contract with the Dolphins expired Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, 26, replaced the injured Dan Marino as the Dolphins' starting 
quarterback last season and finished as the AFC's fourth-ranked quarterback, 
completing 133 of 233 passes (57.1%) for 1,773 yards, 12 touchdowns and eight 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott's looking for a strong defense and a strong running game to keep him 
competitive," Agnone said. "He's interested in the offensive line situation and 
certainly who the offensive coordinator is." 
</P>
<P>
 Agnone said it was "still too early to tell" if Mitchell would visit the Rams' 
practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox, who's handling the quarterback acquisition, was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add free agency: The Rams have secured the right of first refusal on 
restricted free-agent linebacker Roman Phifer by extending him a $649,000 
qualifying offer sheet. The offer sheet was the minimum to guarantee the Rams a 
first-round draft pick as compensation if another team signs Phifer. Otherwise, 
the Rams would receive a second-round pick as compensation, the round Phifer 
was taken in the 1991 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Injury update: Ram wide receiver Todd Kinchen, the team's punt return 
specialist, underwent a second operation on his injured left knee this month. 
Kinchen underwent reconstructive knee surgery in November to repair ligament 
damage he suffered in a game against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The second operation, arthroscopic surgery, was done in early February to 
smooth a rough edge on some bone in his knee. He is expected to return to the 
team in July or August, just after the start of training camp, Ram trainer Jim 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram tight end Pat Carter, an unrestricted free agent, underwent arthroscopic 
surgery on his knee and shoulder last week. Both were routine surgeries.

GANGSTA RAP ACCOUNTABILITY'S A MUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am saddened that Maxine Waters, who has consistently defended the rights of 
women, now chooses to defend a subculture that depends on violence and hatred 
of women for much of its appeal ("Rap Finds a Supporter in Rep. Maxine Waters," 
Feb. 15). 
</P>
<P>
 It's absurd to claim, as Waters does, that male rappers should be forgiven for 
their misogyny because "it's part of the culture."Negative stereotypes of 
African Americans, in characters such as Amos 'n' Andy, Stepin Fetchit and Aunt 
Jemima, were very popular in this country at one time (so were lynchings and 
Jim Crow laws). That hardly makes them defensible. 
</P>
<P>
 Speech is a political act, with implications far beyond the utterance of the 
words themselves. Creating a musical subculture that denigrates half the human 
race is a political decision. Its creators as well as its defenders should be 
held accountable for their choices.

DIGEST: NORDHOFF KICKER LEACH SIGNS TO PLAY FOR DELAWARE

 Nordhoff High kicker Sean Leach has signed a letter of intent with Delaware, 
after he said the Fightin Blue Hens' coaching staff promised to make him the 
No. 1 kicker and punter next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach drew interest from Notre Dame, Syracuse, Oregon, Kansas State and 
several lower division schools.Washington invited him to walk on next fall. But 
Delaware was the only school to offer a full scholarship to Leach, named to the 
all-state medium schools division team by Cal-Hi Sports. USA Today ranked him 
second in the country among punters. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach said the Fighting Irish told him he was their No. 1 choice but later 
opted to "stick with Brian Ford." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, who will be a sophomore next season, was given a scholarship by the 
Irish after he transferred from Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach made seven of 11 field-goal attempts, 33 of 37 extra points and had a 
44.7-yard punting average, including a 77-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the people and the campus at Delaware," Leach said. "It's a good 
atmosphere. Plus, they promised me I would punt and kick for four years, where 
at Notre Dame I'd always have to compete for a job." DANA HADDAD
