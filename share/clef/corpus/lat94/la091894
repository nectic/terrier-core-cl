 Marlon Brando's hold on the public imagination has more to do with his 
scandals, his acting fees and even his weight than any of his recent 
performances. It wasn't always so. Between 1947 and 1954, from "A Streetcar 
Named Desire" to "On the Waterfront," Brando changed the way we think about 
acting. After Brando's raw passion and emotional truth, it wasn't so easy to 
accept Hollywood stars whose appeal was based on ingratiating personality or 
the hammy performance style that had come down from the British stage. No actor 
ever had a more dazzling beginning than Brando. He spent the next 18 years 
squandering it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, on the brink of old age, after many false starts, he has written his 
memoirs. At the same time, a comprehensive biography has also been published. 
Brando's own book, possibly written as a hedge against what the biography might 
uncover, is set down in a gentle mood. "My memories," he writes, "are colored 
by later events and distorted by the blurred prism through which my mind now 
chooses to examine my life." 
</P>
<P>
 In Brando's best performances, he doesn't judge his characters. He creates a 
life, often prickly and contradictory, usually searching and often unhappy, 
then shows it whole, without apparent comment. Now he's tried to achieve 
something like the literary equivalent of that strategy, reporting even his 
most extreme behavior in something like a dispassionate voice. The result can 
be sweet and beguiling but maddeningly incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 Manso's biography, surely the longest ever written about an actor, pays 
respect to Brando's best work but portrays his personal life as going from 
outrageous to near-criminal. Manso has conducted 750 interviews. In addition, 
he has drawn on many books and articles, ranging from Richard Schickel's 
insightful "Brando: A Life in Our Times" to the spiteful "Brando for 
Breakfast," by Anna Kashfi, one of Brando's ex-wives. In Manso's biography 
Brando comes across like Amadeus. In his own book, he's more like Candide. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlon Brando Jr., called Bud, was born in Omaha, the third child and only son 
of a salesman of limestone products. His mother, Dorothy Pennebaker Brando, 
known as Dodie, was a gifted amateur actress with a bohemian disposition. 
Marlon Sr., a man of more conventional outlook, found himself in a household of 
rebellious spirits, none of whom he ever understood. Both he and his wife were 
alcoholics; both were promiscuous. Marlon Sr. was also something of a bully. 
His son hated him. 
</P>
<P>
 After a difficult time in high school in Libertyville, Ill., where the family 
had landed, Bud was shipped off to Minnesota, to Shattuck Military Academy, his 
father's old school. It was wartime. Shattuck took seriously its charge to 
train future officers. Young Bud, however, spent his time in pranks and erotic 
pursuits: He romanced the school maids, the girls of the town, a few faculty 
wives and, by Manso's account, some of the cadets. 
</P>
<P>
 Brando was expelled from Shattuck and wound up in New York. It was 1943. He 
was 18, 4F because of a football knee injury, and except for a few 
well-received turns in school plays, had no skills. His sister Jocelyn was an 
actress, so he enrolled at Erwin Piscator's Dramatic Workshop at the New 
School, hoping to meet girls. One of the teachers was Stella Adler, the 
grandest of dames, who once said, "I could live in any Communist country if I 
were Queen." She saw that this young man from the provinces, with the hooded 
eyes and the soft, mumbling voice, was "the most keenly aware, the most 
empathetical human being alive." He was also an erotic magnet for all around 
him, Adler herself included, according to Manso. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler's method, which came out of the Group Theater and her own private study 
with Stanislavsky, stressed inner reality and emotional exposure. Authenticity 
of feeling was the goal. Brando mastered it from the start. Adler became his 
patron and took him into the sophisticated circle of her family and friends, 
which included her husband at the time, the director and critic, Harold 
Clurman, and her teen-age daughter, Ellen, who was also one of Bud's conquests. 
</P>
<P>
 Brando was soon on Broadway in "I Remember Mama." People who saw it remember 
only Brando. The acting teacher and director Bobby Lewis thought Brando was so 
real "that a stagehand must have wandered on stage." Brando became bored with 
the production and began making trouble both on and offstage. There were always 
women in his dressing room, or waiting at the stage door, often available to 
him between his entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 At Adler's urging, Elia Kazan cast Brando in Tennessee Williams' play, "A 
Streetcar Named Desire." Kazan had worked with Brando earlier, in Maxwell 
Anderson's "Truckline Cafe," and now wanted "to mine what was beneath the 
surface," to excavate what he later called Brando's "great underground." 
Brando's brooding hunt for his character was a trial for Jessica Tandy, who 
played Blanche Dubois. She was English, trained traditionally, and a woman of 
regular habits. It was her husband, Hume Cronyn, who recognized that Brando's 
intensity was changing the play, making it more about Stanley Kowalski than 
Tennessee Williams had intended. 
</P>
<P>
 The best measure of the power of Brando's performance is in the censorship 
dispute around the film of "Streetcar." The Legion of Decency demanded cuts in 
the finished film. Only recently has a restored version been made available. 
The other performances all benefit from the restoration. It makes no difference 
with Brando. From his first appearance, walking home after work, his every step 
and gesture simmering with rude sexuality, he is uncensorable, short of cutting 
out every frame he's in. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Streetcar," Brando never did another play. In his first six films, he 
made such an impression on the public that all actors were measured against 
him. Bobby Lewis put it best: "He'd created not only a standard of acting, but 
a style, which was unfortunate, since everybody after that wanted to act like 
Marlon Brando." He was a new kind of movie star. He was seen to be rebelling 
against everything in American life. He was soaked in sensitivity and Angst, 
the embodiment of the neuroses of the era. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning of his career, Brando voiced doubts about being an actor, 
often saying that he only did it for money and travel. His first Hollywood 
offers were for term deals that would last for years. He always said no. He 
accepted his first screen role as a paraplegic veteran in "The Men" in part 
because no options were attached. That was followed by the film of "Streetcar" 
and then "Viva Zapata!," the story of the Mexican revolutionary, directed by 
Kazan. In his memoirs, Kazan says, "In 'Streetcar' he'd been playing a version 
of himself, but in 'Zapata' he had to create a characterization. He was playing 
a peasant, a man out of another world. I don't know how he did, but he did it; 
his gifts go beyond his knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 He was the most famous young actor in the world, already a subject for 
comedians who mumbled a lot and yelled "Stella!" As if in response to having 
his diction mocked, he played Mark Antony in Joe Mankiewicz' production of 
"Julius Caesar." The reading is clear and unmannered and, unlike so much of 
American Shakespeare, not faux English. Antony's speech to the body of Caesar, 
"O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth . . . " is the center of the film, a 
great theatrical moment that makes the design of the play clear. Brando now 
says in his memoirs that to play Shakespeare "was asinine," because he'd had no 
classical training. Manso reports that at the time, John Gielgud, who was 
Cassius, asked him to come to London and play Hamlet. It was probably 
Hamlet-like of Brando never to be able to make up his mind to dare the role. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wild One," Brando's biker movie, is unwatchable today, except for his 
performance. But "On the Waterfront," the last picture of his early period, his 
last with Kazan and his greatest triumph, is one of the enduring glories of the 
postwar cinema. This was not a literary adaptation or a script he had to carry 
on his back, but a film grounded in political controversy. Kazan and Budd 
Schulberg, who wrote the script, had both been cooperating witnesses for HUAC. 
The movie is a defense of their position. Its most celebrated scene is Brando's 
cab ride with Rod Steiger: "I could have been a contender." Although now Brando 
seems to claim that he and Steiger improvised it, that is unlikely, given 
Brando's own account of it. Kazan, in his memoirs, puts it in perspective. "Who 
else could read, 'Oh, Charlie,' in a tone of reproach that is so loving and so 
melancholy and suggest that terrific depth of pain. I didn't direct that. 
Marlon showed me, as he often did, how the scene should be performed." 
</P>
<P>
 And then the bottom fell out. Brando spent the next 18 years making uneven 
movies, some commercially successful, others not. Actors are at the mercy of 
their opportunities. Their careers only have discernible patterns in hindsight. 
It's now clear that Brando began to draw less on himself and more on accents 
and disguises. He played leading roles as if they were character parts, hiding 
in eccentricity. 
</P>
<P>
 He was regarded as capricious on the set, refusing to adhere to schedules or 
scripts. His behavior was blamed for the ruinous cost overruns and delays on 
"Mutiny on the Bounty." The picture was shot in Tahiti and he fell in love with 
Polynesia, eventually buying the atoll of Teti'aroa, which became his refuge. 
His performance as the foppish Fletcher Christian, was badly received. Today, 
more than 30 years on, it seems to outline a life not unlike the one Brando 
sought for himself. In Polynesia, Fletcher Christian finds his truer, more 
arcadian self. He is still an officer and a gentleman but no longer a fop. He 
tries to reconcile these aspects. It can't be done and he suffers for it and 
dies by fire. It's a classic Brando arc: A man more sensitive than he appears 
discovers his true self only to be punished for it. 
</P>
<P>
 As his career diminished, Brando became known for his politics. Before 
"Streetcar," he had performed in a benefit written by Ben Hecht in support of 
Jewish refugees. Brando donated his salary to the Irgun, the militant -- some 
might say terrorist -- Jews in Palestine. Later, he was active in the civil 
rights movement, supporting the Black Panthers and marching with Martin Luther 
King. And of course, he has long been active in Native American rights. These 
are deeply held views, developed over many years. Yet, with politics, Brando 
has always looked a little ridiculous, unlike, say, his contemporaries Paul 
Newman on the left, or Charlton Heston on the right. They speak persuasively, a 
couple of recognizable gents who always put a sensible amount of themselves 
into a performance. Brando either puts so much of himself into a character that 
he's like Prometheus, his guts pecked out before us, or he hides in technique. 
When he speaks as himself, it's a shock and not always effective. 
</P>
<P>
 He found his way again with two films in the early 1970s. "The Godfather" was 
Hollywood's biggest hit since "Gone With the Wind." To a young public who knew 
Brando's great work only in revival, he seemed to have returned from the dead. 
The film, like "Waterfront," only seems to get better as it ages. It is a 
great, vulgar epic of America, and Brando is its specific gravity, the master 
of the minimalist gesture in an operatic story. Is this what a Mafia boss was 
like in New York after the war? Who knows? For that matter, who cares? Brando 
has imagined him into existence. It's the culmination of his character work, 
done with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 Brando's famous improvised monologues are the most interesting part of "Last 
Tango in Paris," a movie best recalled for the controversy it generated. He 
might not have drawn on himself directly since Terry Molloy; in "Last Tango" he 
does so literally. As the character speaks of his parents and childhood, Brando 
uses his own life. It can't have been easy, but 25 years later it seems more a 
painful stunt than a coherent creation. He made a few more stabs at acting 
after "Last Tango," but mostly there have been highly paid cameo roles in which 
he seems to be imitating Marlon Brando. From 1980 to 1989 he made no films at 
all. He retreated to Teti'aroa or stayed in his house on Mulholland Drive, 
talking about scripts, continuing to seek the truth in Eastern philosophy, but 
mostly putting on weight. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, Brando speaks tenderly of his mother, the actress who lived long 
enough to see the glorious unfolding of her son's career. He's not so kind 
about his father. For years, he writes, "I wanted to smash his face and watch 
him spit out his teeth. I wanted to kick his balls into his throat. I wanted to 
rip his ears off and eat them in front of him. I wanted to separate his larynx 
from his body and shove it into his stomach." When Marlon Sr. died -- at 70; 
his own age now -- he thought, "God, just give him to me alive for eight 
seconds . . . because I want to break his jaw." 
</P>
<P>
 However exasperating and opaque his memoirs frequently are, and however many 
contradictory assertions and remarks cry out for follow up questions, you put 
down his memoirs thinking, "I've been with this man, I've heard his voice." 
</P>
<P>
 What Brando has left out, Manso has uncovered. He is at his best evoking 
Brando's New York days. He places them in a cultural and social context, taking 
us through the rehearsals for "Streetcar" and showing the birth of a great play 
as well as Brando's arrival into public life. 
</P>
<P>
 Manso has chapter and verse for Brando's countless assignations and continuing 
affairs as well as his many bouts with venereal disease. He quotes the actress 
Sondra Lee saying Brando was involved in "hundreds of abortions." Brando speaks 
of nine children, or sometimes 10. The mothers are friends, wives and 
employees. Brando has had so many lovers, it would only be surprising if they 
were all of one gender; the law of averages alone would make him bisexual. 
</P>
<P>
 Manso reports it all as if he were on a mission. But the care with which the 
early New York section is composed gives way to peephole fascination and 
relentless cataloguing. Manso never really puts Brando's bacchanalian life into 
its most significant context: Brando is a movie star and he acts like one. 
Movie stars live on the farthest shore of instinct, their ids given something 
like free reign. When they're not being paid huge sums to act, many of them 
pursue sex and keep people around to carry out their every high-handed whim. 
It's the privilege of office. Given that Brando was increasingly unhappy with 
acting, the rest of it was probably inevitable. Maybe in Brando's case, sex is 
sublimated acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, he's been in the news for personal tragedy. As is well known in 
Los Angeles, Brando's son Christian shot and killed his half sister Cheyenne's 
lover in the Mulholland Drive house, while Brando was at home. Manso seems to 
give credence to Cheyenne's comments to a reporter from Paris-Match to the 
effect that her father, through "auto suggestion," put the idea of the murder 
into her brother's mind. She also says her father abused her sexually when she 
was little. As Manso makes clear, at the time of her remarks, she was in a 
psychiatric clinic. She had been diagnosed as schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
 Manso quotes Eoghan Harris, an Irish writer who worked on a script with Brando 
in 1985, and who caught something fundamental of the man when he called Brando 
"a radical bohemian -- a person without barriers, frontiers or boundaries, who 
has no sense of history nor of his class. . . . Such declassed people . . . are 
capable of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 On the mysteries of his own character, Brando himself may have put it best. He 
was speaking of Charlie Chaplin, who directed him in "A Countess From Hong 
Kong," but surely the subject was himself: "Like all people he was the sum of 
his genetic inheritance and the experiences of a lifetime. We are all shaped by 
our own miseries and misfortunes. He knew how to tap the emotions of his 
audiences to arouse them, and he had an intuitive knowledge of the workings of 
the human personality. But he never learned enough to understand his own 
character."

TAKE ME IN TO THE BALLGAME; THE COMPANION BOOK TO KEN BURNS' PBS SERIES MAY 
OFFER RELIEF TO THE STRIKE-STRICKEN; BASEBALL: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY, BY 
GEOFFREY C. WARD AND KEN BURNS (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $60; 469 PP.)

<P>
 They've taken away our game, damn them. Its stately pace, its exquisite 
subtleties, its charm, its chance, its estival elegance -- gone, this year, in 
the name of Mammon. 
</P>
<P>
 The season's questions have been frozen in time, then wrenched upright into a 
single, ugly exclamation point. Will Matt catch the Babe? Will the Big Hurt 
jolt one to Jupiter? Will Maddux's anachronitic arm prevail over the hinky 
Haitians who wrapped the ball, this season, tighter than Walter O'Malley's 
wallet? Forget it. There's only one answer now: 
</P>
<P>
 Strike! 
</P>
<P>
 Not that baseball has vanished from what Red Smith was pleased to label "God's 
green footstool." There are still the minors, thank God, and the beer-belly 
bunds and the sandlots; give a kid a stick and what we used to call a 
"spaldeen" and in his mind, uncluttered by salary caps, he is Willie, plain and 
pure. And now there's Ken Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember Burns. The guy who conjured up that incomparable "Civil War" 
series for PBS, as well as "Brooklyn Bridge," "Huey Long" and "The Shakers." 
Now he's turned his talents to The Game. "Baseball," it's called; in nine 
parts. It starts tonight, not a moment too soon, and there's a book to go with 
it. A big book, generous in size as well as scope; a coffee-table book, you 
could call it, except that if you get coffee on this sucker you're in for some 
serious grief. 
</P>
<P>
 There are splendid pictures -- scores of them, hundreds, a lot of them rare -- 
as well there should be: Baseball is as visual as it is physical and cerebral. 
And there are words, rollicking reams of them, by Burns and award-winning 
historian Geoffrey Ward, co-author of "The Civil War," and essays by the likes 
of Roger Angell and George Will, Doris Kearns Goodwin and Bill James, The 
Times' own David Lamb and Gerald Early, who puts a spin on the black baseball 
experience, both player and fan, that's original, impertinent, insighful. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll probably thumb through the photos first (gently, gently; lets not be 
bending the pages now); kids choosing up sides by the high-tech method of 
fist-around-the-bat; the Dartmouths hosting the Harvards in a game-on-the-green 
in 1882; a hand-tinted print of the old Cincinnati Reds, each position player 
sporting a different-colored jersey and cap for easy ID (an idea that 
mercifully died aborning); an old geezer on a porch under an American flag, 
portable radio pressed to an ear that hasn't yet heard better days. The hands 
-- just the hands -- of Honus Wagner. Yaz poised, Musial coiled, Sandy staring, 
Jackie spiking, Yogi thinking, DiMag doffing, Williams not doffing, Maris 
balding, Bell barnstorming, Keeler bunting, Satchel relaxing, Ruth ripping, 
Willie in flight . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And the stories, Lord, the stories! There are the familiar ones; Shoeless Joe 
Jackson of the bribed Black Sox pleading with Commissioner Landis for another 
chance (a fat one at that: Judge Landis, while on the bench, once sentenced an 
old-timer to 15 years for robbery. "I'm 75," the felon said. "I can't serve 
that long." Landis: "Do the best you can"). And the unfamiliar ones: Playing in 
1931 for the Crawford Colored Giants on a circuit that was at least of 
major-league caliber, Josh Gibson hit more than 70 homers, inspiring legends 
that still circulate. Hit one so high, they say, that it never did come down, 
Next day, in Philly, a ball drops form the sky into an outfielder's glove. Ump 
points to Josh: "You're out -- yesterday in Pittsburgh." 
</P>
<P>
 Many already know that Cleveland shortstop Ray Champman was killed in 1920 by 
Yankee Carl May's beanball, a tragedy called "baseball's first fatality." Less 
publicized is that fate of one James Creighton, "baseball's first real star" 
and furtive inventor of the curveball. Batting for the Brooklyn Excelsiors in 
1862, Creighton swung so hard he ruptured his bladder, and died four days 
later. Apropos of the curve, more than one league banned it outright. Said 
Harvard president Charles W. Eliot, "I am instructed that the purpose of the 
curve ball is to deliberately deceive the batter. Harvard is not in the 
business of teaching deception." 
</P>
<P>
 No need to reheat the hash here: you'll see it on the tube -- Bobby Thomson's 
homer, Gehrig's farewell, the integration that finally made baseball the 
national pastime. It will delight you in the main, depress you some, rekindle 
the affection for the game you've carried in your mental mitt since you first 
lashed out at a ball so taped, retaped and reretaped it looked like a wounded 
muskmelon. But for lasting pleasure, the Book's the Thing, something you can 
take shelter in, something you can quote: 
</P>
<P>
 Casey Stengel on being fired by the Yankees: "I'll never make the mistake of 
being 70 years old again." 
</P>
<P>
 A losing pitcher on the Athletics' huge first baseman: Jimmie Foxx wasn't 
scouted, he was trapped." 
</P>
<P>
 Satchel Paige: "I never joked when I was pitching. That ball I threw was 
thoughtful stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 PA announcer Tex Rickards: "A little boy has been found lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Umpire Silk O'Laughlin: "The Pope's for religion. O'Laughlin's for baseball. 
Both are infallible." 
</P>
<P>
 George Bernard Shaw: "Who is Baby Ruth and what does she do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Walt Whitman: "I see great things in baseball. It's our game -- the 
American game. It will take our people out-of-doors, fill them with oxygen, 
given them a larger physical stoicism. Tend to relieve us from being a nervous, 
dyspeptic set. Repair these losses, and be a blessing to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Strike that, you bums.

THE LAST GENTLEMAN; THE HOUSE OF PERCY: HONOR, IMAGINATION, AND MELANCHOLY IN A 
SOUTHERN FAMILY, BY BERTRAM WYATT-BROWN (OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $30; 454 PP.) 
 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Wilcox, James Wilcox's most recent novel is Guest of a Sinner. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an essay called "Stoicism in the South" the novelist Walker Percy observed: 
"The greatness of the South . . . had always a stronger Greek flavor than it 
ever had a Christian." So it is no surprise that in "The Moviegoer," Percy's 
award-winning 1961 novel, the patrician aunt sends her somewhat unmoored nephew 
a stern memo quoting the Stoic philosopher and emperor Marcus Aurelius, not St. 
Paul or New Orleans' Archbishop Rummel. Indeed, one generation after another of 
the eminent Percy family turned to Marcus Aurelius for solace and support. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoicism helps explain not only the South's historic emphasis on manners -- 
suitable behavior and appearance were hallmarks of this pagan philosophy -- but 
also on a code of honor. As Bertram Wyatt-Brown, Richard J. Milbauer Professor 
of History at the University of Florida, points out in his meticulously 
researched study of Walker Percy's family, the story of honor is here entwined 
with melancholy -- or in more clinical terms, chronic depression. How various 
members of this gifted family -- several were poets and novelists -- tried to 
cope with the demands of honor and the trials of melancholy through the use and 
misuse of imagination is treated with singular tact and wisdom in Prof. 
Wyatt-Brown's absolutely riveting history. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the book ranges as far back as the early 16th Century with an account 
of an earl's suicide in the Tower of London and does full justice to antebellum 
days both in the South and Philadelphia, it is in the chapters on William 
Alexander Percy (1885-1942) that the abundant historical detail lavished on the 
reader comes into sharp focus. 
</P>
<P>
 After Walker Percy's father committed suicide, "Uncle Will" Percy -- actually, 
he was the novelist's first cousin once removed -- acted as surrogate father 
for Walker and his two brothers. Long before bringing the boys into his roomy 
bachelor's home in Greenville, Miss., Will Percy had replaced the pious fervor 
of his childhood Catholicism with a resigned Stoicism. As Wyatt-Brown 
speculates, "Will's loss of faith in Christianity, and particularly in 
Catholicism, had much to do with his shame at his own sexual feelings. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Practicing law only out of a grim sense of family duty, Will Percy found his 
true calling in writing poetry. These poems, Wyatt-Brown comments, might have 
been a way for Will to cope with the conflicting emotions aroused by his 
greatly inhibited homosexuality. Though this somewhat reductionist view of the 
creative impulse might give some readers pause, Wyatt-Brown also notes how the 
poet's complex stance toward his father echoed a paternal theme in the poetry 
of Will's great-aunt, Eleanor Percy Lee. Indeed, throughout the book 
Wyatt-Brown points out similarities in the creative works of Percy family 
members from disparate generations. "The complicated account of these themes," 
Wyatt-Brown writes, "may help to explain how families, consciously and 
sometimes unconsciously, recapitulate old issues in new settings. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 One issue that confronted every generation of Percys was race. Will Percy's 
father, Sen. LeRoy Percy, fought a courageous battle against the Ku Klux Klan 
that earned him nationwide attention. Although ideals of human dignity and a 
hatred of cruelty undoubtedly inspired him, Will's father based his appeal to 
fellow white landowners in Mississippi on simple economics. Already many blacks 
had left the Delta in search of better wages in Northern industries. "With only 
three parades," LeRoy Percy warned, "no matter how peaceful, the Klan could 
sweep all the remaining blacks out of the region. . . ." There would be no 
laborers to harvest the crops. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Percys' bitter struggle with the Klan, Wyatt-Brown doesn't ignore the 
class resentment that surfaced. LeRoy Percy railed that they were "a cowardly, 
skulky bunch and no thoroughbred ought to have anything but a feeling of 
contempt for them." A true patrician who defied the teetotaling 
self-righteousness of the Klan by openly drinking bootlegged liquor and 
gambling, LeRoy Percy passed on to his son a paternalistic attitude not only 
toward African-Americans but also toward lower- and middle-class whites. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, when Will Percy wrote his memoir, "Lanterns on the Levee," still 
in print today after its 1941 publication, little if any mention is made of 
ordinary citizens. "(B)lack or white," Wyatt-Brown notes, "the people outside 
the family circle -- unless enemies like Bilbo or dependents like Lige -- were 
simply invisible." Yet rather than pass a simple judgment on Will Percy for his 
blatant prejudices, Wyatt-Brown patiently uncovers the deeper humanity of this 
anguished, lonely intellectual. Hodding Carter, whose editorials against racism 
in the Greenville paper won him the 1946 Pulitzer Prize, had this to say about 
the man who was largely responsible for hiring him away from a small Louisiana 
paper: "(Will Percy) sent penniless youngsters to college, helped jobless men 
find work, set up ambitious people in small businesses." Some African Americans 
even referred to him as the "little Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 Will Percy's kindness, unusual in a plantation owner of that time, calls to 
mind the story of his great-grandfather, Thomas George Percy. By 
cross-referencing generations in regard to such character traits, Wyatt-Brown's 
portraits resonate at time with an almost uncanny perspective. By all accounts 
Thomas George Percy should have been plagued with the same ambition and 
depression that afflicted so many other family members. Indeed, his own father 
had committed suicide and his sister was hospitalized for melancholia. Yet in 
those antebellum days Thomas George managed to cultivate a quiet happiness, 
mainly by nurturing devoted friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 The deep platonic bond between Thomas George and a Princeton classmate who 
contracted tuberculosis would be echoed in later years by other Percy 
friendships based on shared intellectual interests. Perhaps the most 
fascinating connection of this sort was not between two Percy men, but that 
between a female descendant, Sarah Ellis Dorsey (1829-1879), and the 
ex-president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 A novelist and biographer, Sarah Dorsey found strength in the meditations of 
Marcus Aurelius during the trials of the Civil War. Although she was "by far 
the most personally involved in the improvement of black life of all the Percy 
connections . . . until . . . Will Percy's day," the terrible fact remains that 
she, like other antebellum Percys, was a slaveholder. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of her life Sarah Dorsey invited the married Jefferson Davis to 
live in a cottage on the grounds of her Mississippi home so that she could help 
encourage him to finish writing his memoirs. Wyatt-Brown's thoroughly 
engrossing account of how this proto-feminist and yet still proper Southern 
lady wound up giving all of her money away to the ex-President -- who was never 
her lover, despite endless gossip -- is a fitting conclusion to the chapters on 
the remarkably accomplished females in the Percy line. 
</P>
<P>
 This wealth of family background helps shed a new light on Walker Percy as the 
book draws to a close with an overview of the novelist's life and work. 
Tentatively, Wyatt-Brown probes a link between Percy's last novel, "The 
Thanatos Syndrome," and Sarah Dorsey's 1864 novel, "Agnes Graham." Even more 
striking plot elements are shared in Percy's "Lancelot" and an 1860 
best-selling novel by a Percy cousin, Catherine Warfield. Considered Percy's 
masterpiece by Wyatt-Brown, "Lancelot" explores the tension between the 
family's age-old Stoic ideals of honor and the selfless demands of Percy's 
Christian faith. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1956 essay on stoicism Walker Percy wrote, "Its most characteristic 
mood was a poetic pessimism which took a grim satisfaction in the dissolution 
of its values -- because social decay confirmed one in his original choice of 
the wintry kingdom of self." For this last gentleman, though, self was no 
longer sufficient. A different choice was made.

RICHARD EDER: FACES OF REVOLUTION; NONE TO ACCOMPANY ME, BY NADINE GORDIMER 
(FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX: $22; 324 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are revolutions -- the French, the Chinese, the Russian -- that devour 
the children who made them. More often, perhaps, it is a matter not of being 
devoured but of being digested. A little ahead of the curve of history, as 
always, Nadine Gordimer writes of two anti-apartheid fighters whom victory, 
like a river rising and jumping its bed, has begun to withdraw from and leave 
stranded. 
</P>
<P>
 "None to Accompany Me" takes place in the blurred and confusing excitement of 
South Africa in the early 1990s. Nelson Mandela was out of jail and negotiating 
with the government, the black exiles were returning and change was happening 
too quickly to be legalized or stopped -- or safe. What with so many straws, 
leaves and twigs in the wind, it was like Birnam Wood advancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the characters, for example, meet at an elegant gallery. It was showing 
a black painter "whose work had become fashionable since city corporations and 
white collectors had seen such acquisitions as the painless way to prove the 
absence of racial prejudice." Gordimer is a master-ironist; here she plays in 
light tones. 
</P>
<P>
 She can play in darker ones. Odendaal, an Afrikaner farmer, refuses to 
negotiate with several thousand squatters. At the same time -- if you can't 
lick the devil perhaps you can make a profit off him -- he quietly but 
unsuccessfully tries to get the government to proclaim the land a black 
township and buy it up. 
</P>
<P>
 In a patriarchal fury, but not really losing his head as it turns out, he 
enlists a band of white commandos. Nine squatters are killed and many wounded, 
including their leader, Zeph Rapulana, one of the book's pivotal figures and 
one of its richest. Zeph is not happy about it -- Gordimer is rarely simplistic 
-- but he recognizes the advantage. Both sides will profit. With nine dead, at 
a time when De Klerk and Mandela are subtly maneuvering toward change, the 
government will have to give the squatters the land. And Odendaal will be 
handsomely paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Two families are the center of the novel. Their fortunes, their nerves and 
their deepest sense of themselves all refract the change between the old 
struggle and the new times. As other authors use sexual passion, Gordimer is 
able to use politics as the fine psychological matrix of her characters. (In 
this novel Gordimer uses sex too, and in some detail, but she uses it 
awkwardly; it lacks pheromones.) 
</P>
<P>
 Vera and Ben Stark are privileged and conscientious whites. She has worked for 
20 years as the indomitable moving force in a foundation that fought apartheid 
in one of its cruelest aspects: its forced displacement and resettlement of 
rural black communities. Her husband, a sculptor once, became a businessman to 
provide security for her dangerous life. 
</P>
<P>
 In their youth two of their closest friends had been Didymus Maqoma, a budding 
Soweto lawyer, and his wife, Sally. Their families would spend weekends 
together at the Stark's pleasant house, despite the apartheid restrictions. 
Then the Maqomas disappeared, ostensibly abroad. In fact, while Sally lived in 
London, Didymus went underground as one of the top leaders of the African 
National Congress resistance inside the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are back. Among the hundreds of returned exiles he has pride of place 
-- a chauffeured car met him at the airport -- as one of the movement's 
authentic heroes. But he had made enemies; and in any case his courage and 
fighting qualities are not what are wanted. Flexibility and the ability to 
negotiate with the white powers are what counts. Shockingly, he is excluded 
from the newly elected executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally, on the other hand, who had lived quietly during the fighting years and 
held their family together, is elected in his place. She had been put in charge 
of finding jobs for the returning exiles. To do so she had to deal with the 
business community; and she showed such tact, energy and talent for it that she 
has become a rising star. The night of her election, and his defeat, she rages 
and mourns in their bedroom; at the same time she feels a dizzying 
exhilaration. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera's passage is less marked and less dramatic. She remains active in her 
mission to fight for displaced black claimants. She works with Zeph against 
Odendaal. And, reluctantly, she will let herself be elevated to the mixed 
commission in charge of drafting the crucial document of the future: a 
constitution. Her decline has to do with a gradual loss of function: white 
heroes will no longer be relevant to the fight for black empowerment. The word 
itself is a displacement for her. "What is this new thing?" she asks Zeph. 
"What happened to what we used to call justice?" 
</P>
<P>
 There is a hint of "Animal Farm" foreboding here and in a few other places, 
but it is only a hint. Gordimer can at the same time be ironic about the 
changes, committed to them and capable of seeing the dangers. There are shadows 
on the new forces; there is also the infinitely promising figure -- though with 
his own dangerousness -- of Zeph. By the end of the book he has achieved 
stature, deepened mystery, and perhaps large promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "None to Accompany Me" is a political novel of intelligence and subtlety and 
it brings us news that we need. It is more than that, as well; though its more 
is somewhat less successful. The characters have an expository function, and 
for the most part what they have to expound is worked into their vital 
condition. Several are memorable; particularly Vera's endearing assistant, 
Oupa, who becomes a tragi-comic victim of the changing times, and Didymus and 
Sally. Their reciprocal rise and fall makes a political point, but it is also a 
moving and beautifully imagined account of the intimate shifts within a 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordimer works them all hard, though, and sometimes their duties wear their 
essences pretty thin. The writing grows rough when it tries to do too much, 
knotting into an odd mix of the baroque and the elliptical. This is 
particularly true with Vera, the novel's main voice. Her personal history, her 
emotions and her character get the fullest treatment of anyone. She has a 
gnawing will to power, as well as genuine nobility, and Gordimer works it into 
her two marriages and her two adulterous affairs. The more deeply she is opened 
up to us, though, the more effortful and less real she becomes. She and the 
author seem to need a certain distance from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Measured distance lights up the book's most haunting link between the 
political and the personal. Vera's function as white mentor dissipates 
gradually; gradually, too, she is growing old. Her last love -- her husband has 
faded away -- can exist only as a relinquishing. "No One to Accompany Me," 
alludes both to the waning of all white hegemonies, even that of heroic 
idealism, and the waning of old age. Gordimer's novel is prophetic, and it has 
the very still quality of what is already passing. Your truest revolution is 
your clock's: recurring each 24 hours, always predictable and always a dismay.

HE SNARLED, SHE SNARLED; FIERCE COMPETITORS BENT ON DEMOLISHING THEIR 
OPPONENTS, JAMES CARVILLE AND MARY MATALIN TELL HOW THEY SURVIVED FACING OFF

<P>
 A clever title. After all, you couldn't have a more exciting come-on than love 
and war. But as one who believes products should be completely accurate in 
their listing of ingredients, I feel obliged to point out that this book's love 
affair was displayed mostly in phone calls of the most unimpassioned sort. And 
while the presidential campaign of 1992 could certainly be called a political 
war, the account of it here is anecdotal in a rather frothy fashion. Yes, it's 
fun, but it amounts to little more than the kind of barrel-of-beer bull session 
that front-line veterans of any war are likely to have when they get together. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, the bull session takes on some luster because the veterans held 
the rank of generals: James Carville, who was Bill Clinton's campaign manager, 
and Mary Matalin, deputy manager of George Bush's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two, Carville is the most interesting, perhaps because the man from 
Carville, La. (general store and post office), is so different from the man 
from Hope, Ark. While Clinton is concerned about his hair-do and image, 
Carville (mostly bald) makes little effort to hide his rough edges. Except that 
he lacks bigotry, he seems a throwback to Dixie's more colorful political past. 
</P>
<P>
 No Rhodes scholar, this fellow; no political protege; no handsome dude (one 
unkind Republican described Carville as looking "like a fish that's swum too 
close to a nuclear reactor"). After 565 hours of failing grades, Carville was 
kicked out of Louisiana State University. He served two undistinguished years 
as a desk-bound Marine; went back to LSU and limped through to a law degree; 
failed at the profession, became a political consultant but didn't manage a 
winning statewide race until he was 42. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the late 1980s his luck made a dramatic turnaround, and in 1991 he 
became a very hot item among political consultants when he took Harris Wofford 
from a 47-point deficit in the polls to beat Richard Thornburgh, George Bush's 
attorney general, for one of Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate seats. Many then bid 
for Carville's service's but Clinton got him. 
</P>
<P>
 Carville and Matalin were already lovers when the campaign began. But knowing 
their colleagues might suspect them of trading secrets if they had much to do 
with each other, they cooled it for the duration. Consequently the 
cliche-addicted press never tired of portraying them as Romeo and Juliet, with 
the deadly rivalry of the Montagues (Democrats) and Capulets (Republicans) 
threatening to ruin their romance. 
</P>
<P>
 The publishers of this book continue to exploit that angle, of course, but 
Matalin, to her credit, says that by the end of the campaign she was "plenty 
damn sick" of the R&J stories. 
</P>
<P>
 So am I, though I'll admit some passing interest in the romance, mainly 
because of what seems to be Matalin's neurotic love-hate attitude toward her 
sweetie. When she learned that Carville was going to handle Clinton's campaign, 
she threw up; when the election was over her first remarks to Carville (whom 
she would marry ere long) were, "I cannot believe you could live on this earth 
and know that you were responsible for electing a slime, a scum, a 
philandering, pot-smoking, draft-dodging pig of a man. . . . You make me sick. 
I hate your guts." 
</P>
<P>
 As you see -- and as she demonstrates these days on her TV talk show, "Equal 
Time" -- Matalin is given to outbursts of strong judgments. There is, for 
example, a refrain running through the book of her hatred of John Sununu, who 
"had the political acumen of a doorknob." But she saves most of her virulence 
for Democrats. Here she reflects the passion of a convert. Matalin used to be a 
pot-smoking (she inhaled), brassiere-less, South Chicago hippie Democrat who 
voted for Jimmy Carter. In college she got Republican religion, and now her 
heroes are folks like the late GOP hit-man Lee Atwater ("one of the most 
wonderful people the world has known") and the right-wing blabbermouth Rush 
Limbaugh, whose voice, she admits, has the power to make her palms sweat. She's 
the kind of true believer who says, "We have worked with the religious right 
for years. The last thing they are is hateful and intolerant." 
</P>
<P>
 "All's Fair" will have its widest appeal among political junkies who keep 
hoping for blood and who enjoy even the minutiae of partisan attacks and 
counter-attacks, of propaganda duels and psychological one-upmanship. Matalin 
is obviously talented at all of the above, but too much of her stuff comes 
across as "cheap, whiny political rhetoric" (Carville's description) emanating 
from "a sort of Miss Know-It-All" (her own description). I finally got to the 
point that when it was her turn to speak again (the format is that of 
alternating voices: Carville, then Matalin, on and on) I begrudged the space 
she took from him. 
</P>
<P>
 A documentary film about the Clinton campaign, called "The War Room," was 
nominated for an Academy Award last year, but for once the written word is 
superior to pictures. If you want to get a feeling for the multilayered emotion 
and semi-organized pandemonium that rocked around the clock at headquarters in 
Little Rock -- the endless chatter, the running and yelling, the scheming, the 
joking, the frustration, the anger (including what workers called Clinton's 
"Standard Morning Outburst") -- go immediately to Chapter 14, also titled "The 
War Room." 
</P>
<P>
 Carville and Matalin are alike in some respects. Campaigns make them vicious. 
"When I'm running a campaign," Carville says, "I always say I want the people 
I'm running against to catch the clap and die." Matalin: "In every campaign . . 
. you're totally myopically fixated on destroying the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the press rarely performs as they want, they agree that it is shallow, 
prone to snap judgments and infuriatingly hardheaded. Carville speaks for them 
both when he says: "Something happens and three minutes after the event (the 
reporters) all talk to each other and decide 'This is the story.' . . . Once 
the collective mind is made up, it will not change. . . . History gets created 
in about three minutes. Don't miss it. If you get there late, you're dead." The 
scenes in "All's Fair" of the spinners in action after the Bush-Perot-Clinton 
debates are enough to prove the truth in the old saying that nobody should 
watch sausage or politics being made. 
</P>
<P>
 For these two, political campaigns are extraordinarily emotional. A lot of 
these pages are wet. Carville, clearly a world-class weeper, wept often. He 
says he sobbed for hours, "drained, weeping piteously, I was just so scared" 
before Clinton went on "60 Minutes" to explain his love life. When the taping 
was over, Carville rushed sobbing into Clinton's arms "and he held me." 
</P>
<P>
 When things are going just right, says Carville, the result can be an ego trip 
that is "very sexual. It's very gratifying, it's very intense. it builds up to 
a climax, if you will. And once you get that feeling, there's nothing that can 
match it. . . . It's fun playing the game, it's fun being in the battle. 
Everyone in the country is watching this one event, say a presidential debate, 
and, hey, man, you're playing in it. Ninety-three million people worldwide 
watching, reporters from all over the world sitting there covering it, and you 
know what the guys on stage are getting ready to say. Sometimes I'd just sit 
there and say, 'Damn. Here's James Carville of Carville, Louisiana . . . in the 
middle of the biggest goddamn event on the planet Earth . . . and I know 
everything. Ain't this fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But there are also plenty of moments of panic and blunder. One of the hardest 
jobs is to make a candidate say what he is supposed to say and not get in 
trouble by ad-libbing. Carville's tricksters started planting a man dressed as 
a chicken at Bush rallies. The man carried a sign saying "Chicken George," 
meaning Bush was afraid to debate. Instead of ignoring the stooge, as Matalin 
and others asked him to do, Bush continued talking to it, explaining to his 
frustrated managers, "I like the chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 Carville had similar troubles. Campaign strategy was to have Clinton talk 
almost entirely about three things: change, the economy and health care. But 
sometimes, to Carville's horror, Clinton would criticize Bush's character -- a 
topic that made Clinton extremely vulnerable to counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes nothing seems to go right. Matalin admits Bush's campaign managers 
lost control of the GOP convention after the opening night and that "we had a 
tin ear" and didn't realize the sour impact Pat Buchanan's mean-spirited speech 
would have on the party's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 How does the winning campaign manager profit? Well, aside from the $15,000 to 
$20,000 per lecture Carville can now demand, plus a king's ransom in consulting 
fees, plus his share of the nearly $1 million he and Matalin reportedly 
received for putting their names on this book, he has some good memories. 
</P>
<P>
 The best goes back to the time when Hillary was not very popular with the 
public. Carville's crew had just received the result of a dial group -- that 
is, a group of people watching a video with their hands on a dial; they turn 
the dial up if they see or hear something they like, down if they don't. When 
Hillary appeared on the screen, Carville recalls, "the dials just plunged. All 
of them. I mean they dropped into a trench. Clinton looked at the chasm line 
and said, 'You know, they just don't like her hair.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I dove under the coffee table. If I caught somebody out of the corner of my 
eye I was gonna die laughing. No one could talk, no one could even make eye 
contact. There was this stifled silence. I stayed under that table, pretending 
to tie my shoe. No way was I standing up. Finally Clinton left the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how you laugh so hard you're scared you're not going to catch your 
breath? People were collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'They don't like her hair!'  
</P>
<P>
 "This was a man who desperately loved his wife. He could not deal with the 
fact that, at the time, Hillary was unpopular. Couldn't deal with it? He 
couldn't see it! If someone asked me one moment to remember from the campaign, 
it would have been 'They don't like her hair.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's blind loyalty and affection supplies the note of softness that this 
tale of unrelenting combativeness needs for relief. It's the kind of softness 
the absence of which in the Carville-Matalin affair makes one uneasy. Not until 
the last line in the book do we finally get the feeling this affair may be 
real. Opening the door of Matalin's apartment, Carville calls out: "Honey, I'm 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Honey? After nearly 500 pages, it's about time.

ONE MAN'S BATTLE

 Steve Salerno's "A Father's Crusade" (Aug. 21) touched a deep chord in its 
reference to persons entrusted "to serve and protect" who have somehow betrayed 
their oath. After a 1980 kidnaping and murder in my family, I had to deal with 
various law-enforcement bureaucracies in San Diego County. Salerno's report 
affirmed my experiences of unaccountability and even sloppiness in our 
institutions of law and order. In my case, efforts to affect procedural changes 
left me doubting my own sense of right and wrong. 
</P>

 When we suffer from a horrible tragedy, the re-victimization that often 
follows can be a wake-up call.

 Men such as "The Monster" should not slip by us and only become known when the 
body is found. The battle against evil must go beyond legislation against the 
acts to the source of the acts themselves. The frontier of this battle involves 
each individual; and the battleground is the human soul. Small victories can be 
won by presenting truth where there are lies, and love where there is 
indifference. And by having the guts, like Sam Knott, to confront evil despite 
the indifference or criticism we may face.

 Some unsettling questions about law-enforcement priorities and governance are 
raised by Sam Knott in his attempt to baby-proof the world. Like Candy 
Lightner's trampling of search warrants in her march to end drunk driving, or 
the various ill-conceived "three strikes" bills following the Polly Klaas 
murder, Knott's answers may be worse than the problems they purport to cure.

 Salerno states that Craig Alan Peyer was the only CHP officer ever convicted 
of committing first-degree murder while on duty. Another CHP officer, George 
Gwaltney, was charged in 1982 with murdering a 23-year-old woman on I-15 east 
of Barstow. Gwaltney's first two trials in Superior Court in San Bernardino 
County ended in hung juries, but in 1984 he was convicted in U.S. District 
Court.

 Officer Gwaltney was never technically found guilty of committing murder, with 
two trials in San Bernardino County Superior Court failing to convict him. A 
U.S. District Court, however, found Gwaltney guilty of violating the victim's 
civil rights when he raped and killed her.

ISN'T THE TRUTH ALWAYS A MOSAIC?; GOLDBERG'S ANGEL: AN ADVENTURE IN THE 
ANTIQUITIES TRADE, BY DAN HOFSTADTER (FARRAR, STRAUS, GIROUX: $22; 241 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andrew Solomon, Andrew Solomon's last book is The Irony Tower: Soviet 
Artists in a Time of Glasnost (Alfred A. Knopf). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is little point embarking on a synopsis of Goldberg's Angel, because the 
book itself, at 241 pages, seems to be a synopsis of a story that would 
properly require more volumes than the Britannica. The simple frame from which 
the baroque plot dangles is that a smart blond lady, one Peg Goldberg of 
Indianapolis, bought some mosaics which proved to have been stolen from a 
church in northern Cyprus; Cyprus sued to repatriate the mosaics; Peg gave her 
best defense; she lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Irked, she tried to discover how the mosaics had left Cyprus in the first 
place, under what circumstances they had been sold to her, and whether she 
could re-establish rights to them. Her search led her across continents and 
societies; she spoke to thieves and noblemen; she climbed mountains and she 
haunted difficult cities. She found out very little. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Hofstadter, a journalist and self-styled private eye with a trace of the 
mad gentleman-scholar about him, became involved in the search and traveled to 
even more places, consorted with even more gypsies, con men and handsome 
strangers, excavated where no one had ever excavated before. He also found out 
very little. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goldberg's Angel" fascinates with its curious pointlessness. If one bears in 
mind that Odysseus returns home at the end of his journeys, and that the Ring 
Cycle begins and ends with those Rhine maidens singing their rather nasal 
leitmotif, then one can perhaps assign "Goldberg's Angel" a place in a fine 
tradition of epics that lead back only to themselves -- for your acceptance of 
this book as an epic is a crucial starting proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Within this grand structure, Hofstadter paces things like a John Grisham 
novel, giving strange presages of what is to come, dropping names meaningfully 
into what would otherwise appear to be a meaningless digression, holding the 
answer always at arm's length. He makes you trust a character for 20 pages only 
to pull the rug out form under you at the last minute: the obvious villains 
mostly come out looking innocent, and none of the innocents can quiet be 
trusted. He leads you on to fall in love with someone and then slams you with 
that person's evil. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way he seems to taunt you almost sadistically with the question of 
his own trustworthiness, inviting you to accept unquestioningly his version of 
events, but at the same time poking holes in each of his own arguments. In a 
most un-naive fashion, he constantly tells you how naive he is, and in a 
distinctly unsophisticated way he boasts of his sophistication. In fact, he 
puts you through the same hoops through which he was obliged to leap: he does 
not simply recount his confusion and frustration, but rather allows you to 
experience it yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 This annoying, brilliant, comical, gripping, obsessive exercise in 
self-indulgence is also fantastically sensual. Hofstadter conjures the smell of 
each of the people with whom he tangled: the elusive Aydin Dikmen, the unseen 
evil genius at the heart of the book; feisty Peg Goldberg, who perhaps had some 
information right from the beginning; the three bodyguards of whom everyone is 
so frightened, Marko, Draza, and Hans; the fiercely proud Savo Kujundzic, who 
may or may not know where the feet have gone; the conniving Michel van Rijn, 
who believes that kindness is a weakness; that inexplicable duo, Mehmet and 
Ahmet, who should be able to unlock all the secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 We get a full sense of each of these characters, of how they live, of how they 
speak, of what they have for breakfast. Like Hofstadter, though, we are never 
sure which, if any of them, is telling the truth; we seldom have a clue as to 
why they are saying or doing anything at all, and we are particularly mystified 
by their decision to talk to our narrator Dan. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a strong temptation, about a third of the way through, to flip to the 
end of the book and see what kind of resolution or explanation we could 
possibly be headed for, and we are kept from doing this only by the awareness 
that whatever the conclusion is, it probably won't make much sense to anyone 
who hasn't dragged through the history that precedes it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofstadter has a capacity for exquisite, lyrical prose; he revels in his own 
language, and makes good use of richly various circumstances to toss around 
pungent adjectives, far-fetched metaphors, virtuoso constructions. Such dense 
description, which under other circumstances might seem self-conscious, here 
provides a welcome occasion to breathe and assimilate the unending catalogue of 
subtle narrative complexities that are key to the tale. Hofstadter does 
sometimes wallow in his own prose, conjuring an air of mystery around events 
that are not in fact mysterious, and this can be rather irritating, since there 
is no shortage here of events that are actually mysterious; but his own thrall 
to his subject (he describes himself as a "Kanakaria junkie" in connection with 
the mosaics) says the reader from the start. It all interests him so much that 
it perforce interests you. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofstadter has struggled valiantly to organize his material, but it is too 
slippery to give in easily to the author's rage for order. The combination of 
the high language and the increasingly hilarious and dangerous position of the 
bemused author (both in his experience and in his attempts to interpret it) 
make the whole thing feel in places like an old '50 movies: you can almost hear 
the Hitchcock music playing as Dan heads toward Munich; you get a real surge of 
adrenaline when the two Ahmets prove to be one and the same; the whole 
overwritten affair of the man with the amethyst ring has a brassy absurdity 
satisfyingly evocative of Hollywood melodrama. Many of the "answers" the author 
earnestly puts forward are clearly ridiculous, but then the theories you begin 
to hatch in your head are also ridiculous, and even if you have long held out 
against conspiracy theories on principle, you cannot break away from the idea 
that someone or something has to be behind all the weirdness recounted here. 
Who or what, though -- your guess is as good as Dan's. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any good study in conspiracy theory, this one makes you feel that the 
world is an impossibly complicated place, and that decent Americans innocent of 
its bizarre secrets have a certain idiocy about them. Hofstadter cheerily 
implicates both himself and the reader in this ingenuousness. He can no more 
explain his characters than Wagner could the in-politics of Valhalla. 
</P>
<P>
 The book opens with a prologue, a kind of prose poem paean to the Grand Bazaar 
in Istanbul, which in its specific details has no bearing on the rest of the 
text. It uses a vocabulary now deemed most unfashionable: an Orientalist 
language invented long ago to evoke the mysterious East, where motivations are 
different and life is different and everyone does different things for 
different reasons. Hofstadter intends this as a metaphor for his subject 
matter, but it is really a metaphor for his book, which is not at all Turkish 
in any very authentic sense but is as brilliantly Oriental as anything by De 
Quincey. You lose yourself in it as you do among the merchant stalls in 
Istanbul; you resent being lost; and then you realize that the best, the only 
way to experience it is to lose yourself in and to it. If you read this as a 
text with an object -- if you expect to get to the bottom of things -- then you 
will be sorely disappointed, but if you read it for the voluptuous Oriental 
experience of its characters, its prose and its riveting complexity, then you 
will find that it is, in its way, a tour de force of the first order. Even the 
incredibly contrived sequence (a dream dialogue) that Hofstader foolishly 
tacked on the end to justify his work to conservative readers does not quite 
destroy his masterful articulation of his own mixed pleasure and frustration as 
he pursued a pure truth that he had ultimately to understand that he could 
never find, a pure truth that probably never existed.

 William J. Bennett is correct when he frets about there being "a coarseness, a 
callousness, a cynicism, a banality and a vulgarity to our time" ("The Eggheads 
of the GOP," by Nina J. Easton, Aug. 21). What other words could describe the 
Administration that used a free country's tax dollars to subsidize a decade's 
worth of murder, terror and rape in El Salvador? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure that the minute Bennett sets straight these low-income, willful, 
unmarried (gasp!) girls, he'll move on to study his former co-workers' 
complicity in human rights abuses -- that is, as soon as someone tosses him 
$3.1 million to do so.

 Is Bennett the same one who almost single-handedly screwed up the entire 
educational system of the country under President Ronald Reagan? Is he the same 
"egghead" who ensured, under President George Bush, that we will be living with 
the morass created by the drug culture for decades to come?

 The shift in conservative emphasis from economic freedom to moral behavior 
challenges the liberal focus on group victimization. Government rewards for 
behavior contributing to the decay of society -- such as Social Security 
benefits for drug addicts and welfare handouts for illegal immigrants and 
mothers of illegitimate children -- result in government sanctioning of 
irresponsible behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative thinkers give voice to the societal backlash against liberal 
moralizing. Those engaging in responsible sexual behavior, who must subsidize 
people practicing irresponsible sex, are tired of being denounced as intolerant 
bigots for questioning this order.

 No one is more dangerous than someone who has nothing to lose. More than one

 The "Merchants of Virtue" want us to believe in a simple answer -- theirs. One 
stereotypical philosophy, or one political party, doesn't fit all problems. 
These retro-conservatives define problems well, but their major solutions are 
to return to mythological good old days that really weren't that good for most 
of us. (Before World War II, most eligible teen-agers didn't graduate from high 
school, for instance, and lack of preventive and other health care kept the 
average life short and not too sweet). 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the Bible nor the Constitution anticipated anything like today's 
technological world and its dilemmas. We need calm, rational discussion that 
results in compromise and coming together, not destructive name-calling and 
childish bickering that divides us into "us and them."

 As retro-conservatives plan to bring virtue and values to the masses, perhaps 
they should consider starting their lessons with the Republican elite. Then the 
trickle-down effect (remember that?) could kick in. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson on honesty should be directed to Oliver North, who pulls down tens 
of thousands of dollars from his friends by bragging about scamming Congress. 
Compassion? Let's send that one to Ronald Reagan, who swelled the ranks of the 
homeless with the indigent and the mentally ill. And the lesson on virtue and 
citizenship should go to the retro-cons' friends in industry who collect 
exorbitant salaries as American workers are laid off and their jobs sent to 
Third World countries.

 Retro-cons say the welfare system has caused the irresponsible behavior of 
some parents. Am I missing something here? Isn't responsibility about electing 
to do what is ethical, regardless of other available options? Irresponsible 
fathers will abandon their children with or without the existence of a welfare 
system. Responsible fathers won't.

PROFILE; WHAT'S UP, DOC?; GEORGE CLOONEY RETURNS TO THE SCENE OF A FAMILIAR SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Clooney may be the only actor who has starred in two TV series with the 
same name. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years ago, Clooney got his big break on the short-lived CBS comedy series 
"E/R," which was set in a Chicago hospital's emergency room. Clooney played a 
wiseacre medical intern named Ace. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a fun series," recalls Clooney, who is the son of "American Movie 
Classics" host Nick Clooney, nephew of singer Rosemary Clooney and cousin of 
actor Miguel Ferrer. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Clooney is back in his green scrubs as a regular on NBC's highly 
touted Thursday- night series "ER," which, as was "E/R," is set in a Chicago 
emergency room. This time around Clooney has graduated to full-fledged doctor: 
Douglas Ross, a charming pediatric resident who handles the pressures of the ER 
by drinking during his off hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "ER," which was created by "Jurassic Park's" Dr. Michael Crichton and John 
Wells ("China Beach"), is Clooney's eighth TV series. 
</P>
<P>
 Disarmingly charming, Clooney loves to joke about his rather dismal series 
track record and seems to relish putting down his acting ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did some bad (series)," says Clooney, relaxing in his trailer at the Warner 
Bros. lot where "ER" films. " 'Baby Talk' was bad. I quit that. 'Sunset Beat' 
wasn't necessarily a great show. I played an undercover cop on a Harley during 
the day, and by night I was a rock star. We did 13 and they aired two before 
they canceled us. 'Bodies of Evidence' wasn't a bad show. 'Roseanne' -- you 
can't forget the one good one I had in my career." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roseanne" wasn't the only "good" series though. Last season, Clooney played 
Sela Ward's love interest on NBC's long-running "Sisters." The season ended 
with the two lovers on a plane that was about to crash. Clooney stays mum on 
whether he survives the crash. "I just shot three episodes that take care of my 
little problem on 'Sisters,' " Clooney says, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Sisters,' he says, "was a grand show to be on. Everybody is real nice. I 
love all of those girls. We really had a fun time. But the show is called 
'Sisters' and it will always be called 'Sisters.' I will never be a sister . I 
put on a long red wig and tried it, and it didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Clooney, who has had a development deal at Warners, heard about "ER" through 
the studio's grapevine and quickly pursued the showy role of Dr. Ross. "When 
you're under contract they usually just say, 'Would you like to do this?' This 
is one I wanted really badly and read for this role specifically. He's a bit of 
a womanizer. He has a real drinking problem, and any type of work with Steven 
Spielberg (Spielberg's Amblin Television is one of the producers), Michael 
Crichton and John Wells, you have got to jump. It's a great break for me 
especially because I'm not really known for doing good television. You don't 
look at me and say, 'Hey, he's great.' All kidding aside, I've been really bad 
in a lot of TV series I've done over the years. I've been good in some and I'm 
proud of the ones I have been good in. You learn as you get older how to make 
things work." 
</P>
<P>
 "George was pretty well-connected around the studio," recalls Wells, who also 
is executive producer. "He refers to it as his lot. He told me what he wanted 
to do was this part. He told me, 'Nobody else can have it.' After the pilot did 
get a pickup, he told me, 'I'm coming in on Friday and I'm going to get this 
part.' So he came in and he memorized one of the scenes: the scene (in the 
pilot) with the abusive mother. He was the first and only person we saw for the 
role. He just came in and read it. He was very good in it and we said, 'You got 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Wells: "George is a very funny guy. He is a great presence on the set. He 
keeps us all in stitches." 
</P>
<P>
 The series also has become a family affair for Clooney. Ferrer guests as a 
cancer patient in the premiere episode, and Aunt Rosemary will appear in an 
upcoming show. 
</P>
<P>
 Clooney says he doesn't want Dr. Ross to become the Arnie Becker of "ER." "I 
walk a tightrope on this show. I didn't want to be the womanizing, 'Hey 
sweetheart, baby' kind of guy. I don't want to be the guy who gets hit in the 
face with a pie and everybody goes, 'Yeah, that's great.' This guy may 
earnestly chase women, but you get to see some of the process involved." 
</P>
<P>
 So is Dr. Ross the best role he's ever had? 
</P>
<P>
 "You want me to be honest or modest?" Clooney asks. "When you are doing good 
writing or working with good actors and good directors, it's difficult to be 
bad. I'm in a great position. I'm in a show that every actor would rip out 
their eyes to be in. I've a showcase part and I do a good job in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clooney doesn't seem fazed that "ER" is going head to head on Thursday nights 
with "Chicago Hope," CBS' new medical series from "Picket Fences" creator David 
E. Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful series and if I were on it, I would be extremely proud," he 
says of "Chicago Hope." "I couldn't say anything bad about it if I wanted to. 
And I certainly want to. But I still like our chances. I love our chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Another mischievous grin dances across Clooney's face. "We are doing something 
neat which 'Chicago Hope' won't do: Everybody who watches the show gets a free 
car," he jokes. "I think that's a neat thing. We're proud of that fact." 
</P>
<P>
 A two-hour "ER" premieres Monday at 9 p.m. and moves to its regular time slot 
Thursday at 10 p.m. on NBC.

 Regarding Patt Morrison's "The Metropolitan Divide" (On the Town, Aug. 21): 
</P>
<P>
 I live in West L.A. I do not have a pool, a chauffeur or a guest house. I 
don't belong to a gym.At least once a week, someone sleeps overnight in a van 
on my block, too. If Morrison really views the Westside as nothing but 
Brentwood and Beverly Hills, she doesn't know her city very well. Most 
Westsiders cannot afford and don't want to live in Beverly Hills, though we 
hold nothing against those who do. 
</P>
<P>
 My Westside neighborhood has ethnic diversity, gangs, bail bondsmen, people 
who sell dope on the street and junkies who break into my garage. There's a 
methadone clinic two blocks from where I live and a fencing operation at a 
local convenience store (so I learned from the police after I was burglarized). 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't noticed whether the day laborers who congregate a block from my 
apartment are discussing the Eastside-Westside issue, but I doubt it. Where do 
you think they live?

<P>
 Instead of engaging in an our side vs. your side taunt, Morrison should 
examine why such a division exists at all and point up exceptions to the 
stereotype. I argue for encouraging exploration of the Eastside by Westsiders 
and vice versa -- no altar-worshiping required.

 Lethal Weapon 2 (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) again has Mel Gibson and Danny Glover 
as a cop team, but this 1989 sequel is outrageously overscaled and has the 
brain-rattling pace of a speed freak going the wrong way on a freeway. This 
time, Gibson and Glover go after a drug kingpin operating under diplomatic 
immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 KTLA presents four 8 p.m. airings of Clint Eastwood movies, starting Monday 
with Play Misty for Me, which marked Eastwood's assured 1971 directorial debut. 
Eastwood stars as a Monterey Bay deejay stalked by a deranged fan (a bravura 
turn by Jessica Walters). 
</P>
<P>
 While this film shows the lean, taut influence of director Don Siegel (who 
appears briefly), Eastwood's surreal 1973 Western High Plains Drifter (Tuesday, 
again Saturday at 7 p.m.) echoes Eastwood's other mentor, Sergio Leone, who 
directed him to stardom in a series of '60s spaghetti Westerns. Indeed, 
Eastwood once again becomes Leone's "The Stranger," as the steely, monosyllabic 
sharpshooter of "Drifter." His mission is to face down three gunmen on their 
way to wipe out a frontier town. This stylized allegory, chillingly 
paranoid,atmospheric and filled with sardonic humor, is as ambiguous as it is 
violent -- and much like a samurai movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by John Sturges and written by Elmore Leonard, Joe Kidd (Wednesday) 
is a solidly crafted 1972 Western that forthrightly depicts injustices to 
Mexican Americans. Robert Duvall and John Saxon co-star with Eastwood, who is 
hired by land owner Duvall to track down some Mexican Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Siegel's wry, witty Coogan's Bluff (Thursday), the first of the five 
Siegel-Eastwood collaborations, turns Southwestern lawman Eastwood loose on 
Manhattan's mean streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Omen IV: The Awakening (KTTV Tuesday at 8 p.m.), a 1991 TV movie, extends the 
legacy of Damien, the Son of Satan, with decidedly diminishing returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Crocodile Dundee II (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) is almost as much fun the second 
time around. As an adventure, this 1988 release is nothing special, yet it 
again shows to advantage the tremendously likable Paul Hogan, who this time out 
must rescue his journalist girlfriend (again Linda Kozlowski) from a Colombian 
drug kingpin. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ford's dark-hued 1947 The Fugitive (KCET Saturday at 9 p.m.) finds a 
revolutionary priest coming into conflict with the man who once extended him 
hospitality. Henry Fonda, Dolores Del Rio and Pedro Armendariz star; Gabriel 
Figueroa was the film's great cameraman.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Television producer Daniel Wilson thought he had a great idea 15 years ago, 
when he first approached Soviet officials about making a documentary on the 
Hermitage, the cultural jewel of the city then known as Leningrad. "I wanted to 
look at one of the world's great museums and see how it functioned in a closed 
society," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 His request was refused on grounds that film crews and TV lights might damage 
the artworks. But he didn't give up. In 1991, after Mikhail Gorbachev's 
perestroika policy had opened the country to foreign concepts, Wilson tried 
again. This time he got a favorable response -- to a far more challenging idea. 
"What struck me was that I had to tell a story," he says. "It wasn't enough to 
look at beautiful paintings. The way to provide access to the art was to put it 
in historical context so that people could better understand the significance 
of what they were seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 The result is "The Hermitage: A Russian Odyssey," a three-part series airing 
on PBS. With veteran broadcast journalist Rod MacLeish as narrator, the 
documentary takes viewers on a journey through nearly four centuries of 
history, from the founding of St. Petersburg by Peter the Great, through the 
collecting passion of Catherine the Great, to the horrors of World War II and 
the collapse of the Soviet Union. The program charts the phenomenal growth and 
partial dispersal of the Hermitage's European and Oriental art collection amid 
a pageant of royal aspirations, political upheavals and human suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 The first segment, "Catherine the Great: A Lust for Art," focuses on an 
extraordinary ruler who called herself "a glutton for beauty." She amassed more 
European masterpieces than the Louvre had collected in four centuries and built 
a museum in a baroque Winter Palace to house her treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyrants and Heroes: The Nineteenth-Century Czars," the second episode, spans 
the reigns of Alexander I, who repulsed Napoleon's invasion; Nicholas I, who 
sold off 1,219 paintings from the Hermitage collection; and Alexander II, who 
added a priceless cache of Sythian gold. "From Czars to Commissars: A Museum 
Survives," the final hour, tracks the museum through two wars, a revolution 
that transferred artworks from private hands to state-owned institutions and 
the emergence of a new, deeply troubled nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to show all that history and the vastness of the art collection on 
television because it's a close-up medium," Wilson says. "But I felt it was 
essential to tell the story and be as informative as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 He hadn't planned to do the last segment, but as the project developed it 
seemed increasingly important to bring the drama up to the present, he says. In 
retrospect, the decision appears inevitable because Wilson and his crew were 
swept into the evolution of a rapidly changing nation. While the film was in 
process, the Soviet Union was transformed into a new Russia and Leningrad 
regained its former name of St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Right up to the minute when Wilson and his team gained entrance to the museum, 
the project was tenuous. In one of many glitches, the film crew discovered that 
they couldn't drive to St. Petersburg from their base in Amsterdam because the 
roads were too rough for their delicate equipment, so they headed for Sweden 
and took a ferry across the Baltic Sea. Then, on Aug. 17, 1991, the day before 
the shoot was to begin, an attempted coup d'etat against Mikhail Gorbachev 
threatened to dismantle the government. Upon their arrival at the museum, the 
crew found 350,000 people gathered on an adjacent public square to hear a 
calming speech by the city's mayor. There would be no filming that day, but the 
team got to work 24 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the challenge of gaining the museum staff's trust. "After the first 
couple of days, the curators could see that we were taking great care with our 
work," Wilson says. "Once they saw that we really cared about the collection, 
there was nothing they wouldn't do for us. The head curator, Vladimir Matveyev, 
was enormously helpful. He cut through red tape." 
</P>
<P>
 The crew worked from noon to the wee hours, Wilson says, recounting vivid 
memories. "Filming in the Rembrandt galleries was one of the most exhilarating 
experiences of my life. But the challenge was to convey the enthusiasm we felt 
onto the screen so that others could enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hermitage portrayed on film is a sumptuous palace, packed with superior 
examples of artworks by no less than Titian, Rubens, Caravaggio and Matisse. 
But, as news reports during the last few years have revealed, the ornate 
buildings are threatened with decay and the artworks suffer from a lack of air 
conditioning and conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most gratifying rewards of making the documentary is that it has 
helped to raise awareness of the Hermitage's dilemma, Wilson says. At the 
invitation of the Russian government, UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization) is drawing up a master plan for the 
museum's future. In addition, an American organization, the American Friends of 
the State Hermitage Museum Inc., has been established to raise money for 
preservation, restoration and expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud that the program has served as a catalyst for this effort," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hermitage: A Russian Odyssey," airs all three parts Sunday at 1 p.m. on 
KCET; and one segment each Wednesday at 10 p.m. on KOCE beginning this week.

 THE LAST EMPRESS: The Life and Times of Alexandra Feodorovna by Greg King 
(Birch Lane: $24.95; 430 pp.) It is a telling detail, a portent, if you will. 
Little Princess Alex of Hesse, summering with Queen Victoria at Buckingham 
Palace, is fascinated by one of Grandma's mechanical toys, a full-sized lion 
with a crank for a tail. "When the tail was turned, the lion opened his mouth 
and swallowed the model of a Russian soldier." Swallow Russia she did, the girl 
who grew up to be Alexandra, though hardly single-handed and not by design. It 
is a familiar story: Nicholas rules Russia; Alexandra rules Nicholas; Rasputin 
rules Alexandra. Everyone is slaughtered -- except maybe daughter Anastasia -- 
and Russia lives unhappily ever after. A familiar story but one that hasn't 
begun to lose its quota of captivation. Handsome, feckless sovereign; fey, 
haughty Anglo-German who hitches her wagon to a czar; hemophiliac heir; 
sex-crazed mad monk -- can't miss. Nor is King's entry any less fascinating 
than its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 It is King's conceit that the "disintegration" of Alexandra -- and by 
extension, of Russia -- was predestined by the 22 years before she married the 
man who was so spectacularly unqualified to rule (hence the vacuum into which 
she stepped, Rasputin on her well-turned heels). Mother Alice of Hesse was 
obsessed by death and the hereafter. Alexandra, then, grew up in a state of 
almost exalted melancholy and extreme religiosity. Coupled with "a 
susceptibility to grandeur and opulence," they were traits unlikely to endear 
her to the lusty, bucolic Russians. Her dependence on the randy Rasputin, 
moreover, was at once touching and somewhat Satanic; she (and author King) 
believed that the monk truly could alleviate son Alexei's illness merely by his 
presence: "Rasputin would pray; God would answer. To Alexandra, it was as 
simple as that." King build his case, painstakingly and with flair, in a 
valuable addition to the ongoing riddle of the Romanovs.

 TALKING PICTURES: With the People Who Made Them, edited by Sylvia Shorris and 
Marion Bundy (The New Press: $25; 400 pp.) It was a nice notion.It just didn't 
quite come off. The idea was to chat up some movie hands -- property masters 
and producers, grips and gaffers -- on how it was in a Hollywood of softer 
edges. A labor of love, really, and not too soon: Of 38 film people 
interviewed, 17 died before the book was published. The trouble is in the 
telling. Not that the old-timers are necessarily less-gifted raconteurs than 
vox pop. at large. Some are spellbinders. Some aren't. That said, eavesdrop on 
some of the more colorful chroniclers of foretime: 
</P>
<P>
 William Fadiman, story editor: "Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia Pictures, had 
an offer for the studio. I said, 'Harry, why don't you accept it? You'd have a 
lot more money.' He said, 'But who would invite me to dinner?' " Eleanor 
Wolquitt, reader: "They hired me to help (German writer Curt Siodmak) with the 
English idiom for 'Tarzan and the Fountain of Youth.' Like 'Me Tarzan, you 
Jane,' I suppose, instead of 'Ich Tarzan, du Jane.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On second thought, there's more than a chuckle, and instructive, too. Herbert 
Wrench, editor: "I needed some men laughing and I couldn't find anything right, 
so I went down to the library and got some chickens clucking and ran it 
backwards. I put it in there and nobody knew." That's entertainment!

 RATTLEBONE by Maxine Clair (Farrar, Straus & Giroux: $19; 213 pp.) There's a 
melody to Maxine Clair's stories, rubato against the rhythm of Rattlebone, her 
fictional black community hard by Kansas City.Here, as elsewhere, lives are 
played out to the blues, to jazz, to swing, even to a waltz or two. But this 
isn't elsewhere. It could be a white village of the languid '50s, but it's not. 
Too much joie de vivre for Sleepy Hollow. Too much pulse. Even the seasons have 
a beat: "If winter seemed definite, desperate, then spring seemed timid, 
capricious, like an innocent girl feigning illness," and fall, with its trees 
"exploding in red, like random madness." Clair clearly, is a poet by trade, a 
word-weaver of early and unmistakable talent. Her Rattlebone folks are very 
real, the raunchy and the reserved, the public personae and the private, and 
they speak with an unself-conscious syncopation that pops in the ear. Sometime 
narrator Reenie, lovingly traced from 6 to high school, observes: Her father 
James, honest, industrious but a dreamer, who keeps leaving mother Pearlean -- 
"Too early, before bird-twitter, I heard my father's brogans shuffling" -- and 
making up: "What had once been raw chunks of conversation flung in the face had 
at last mellowed to decently thin slices that could easily be swallowed." When 
she wins a scholarship, "the day wore its widest blue sky," and so will you.

 A MARRIAGE MADE AT WOODSTOCK by Cathie Pelletier (Crown: $22; 288 pp.) No 
wonder Chandra leaves Frederick. You would too. This guy is boring.A real nerd. 
Anal-retentive as a Pamper. In his Maine suburb, he has to be the first one up. 
Before shopping he alphabetizes his grocery list. While shopping, he advises 
housewives to choose the welded cans, not the soldered ones. He cuts out of his 
wife's Christmas party "to explore a new spreadsheet update." He calculates the 
annual cost of his razor blades. He doesn't remember, he "downloads cerebral 
data." When his wife finally splits -- "I'm not leaving for another man. I'm 
leaving for Chandra" -- he doesn't hesitate to speak his mind: "You'd better 
not take my Ultra-Brite." It's tough to wrap a novel around a wimp. Cathie 
Pelletier gives it her best shot. She misses. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Woodstock, the real one, where they met, Chandra has continued to be 
caring, concerned, committed, etc. She boycotts a lot. Gives seminars. That 
sort of thing. Frederick has chosen to become an accountant; somebody has to 
pay the bills. Why they've been married for 20 years is anyone's guess. The 
problem is, Pelletier's men all are cretins. Bourgeois cretins. They "mill 
about their yards like plump locusts that surface periodically, seven-day 
cycles." Or they preen middle-agedly in taverns, hitting on numb, nubile chicks 
and wearing hand-painted cravats ("If Leonardo da Vinci were alive today he'd 
be doing neckties"). Chandra isn't entirely a prize; Pelletier's too smart for 
that. Chandra hangs with women named Sukie and Halona; she counts women's 
rights instead of sheep. But Frederick's the main man here. Will he see the 
light? Is the Pope Italian?

 LAST GO ROUND: A Real Western by Ken Kesey With Ken Babbs (Viking: $21.95; 238 
pp.) To hell with the facts.There were these three fabulous rodeo riders; that 
we know. Competed for the first world championship, they did, in Pendleton, 
Oregon, in 1911. Jackson Sundown, Johnathan Spain and George Fletcher, and "to 
make sure posterity gets the point," complexions in a rare photo are 
hand-colored: "One rider's face is tinted Indian copper, one Caucasian pink, 
one a deep molasses brown." Newspaper accounts are illusory. The fix was in -- 
or was it? Arms were broken. Gold changed hands. No less a legend than Buffalo 
Bill is suspect. . . . "This is why we elect to conjure our three spectral 
riders out of the old tall tales, told over hot coffee around a camp fire, 
instead of the cold facts and half-baked truths served up by library stacks." 
</P>
<P>
 That's Ken Kesey writing, the Merry Prankster. He and buddy Ken Babbs spin 
their yarn with great excess. Entertaining. Wacky. Sometimes sappy. Best 
writing is at the end, in Kesey's spirited evocation of real cowboys and 
broncos that are, literally, man-killers. But it takes a power of time to get 
there.

 CALLED OUT by A.G. Mojtabai (Doubleday: $22; 192 pp.) Years ago, J.A. 
Mojtabai, flirting with a fine theological point, postulated for a Roman 
Catholic canon lawyer a disaster in which a priest, ignorant of religious 
affiliation of the victims, nevertheless proceeds to administer last rites to 
all of them, anointing and granting absolution willy-nilly, as it were.What if 
the victim were an atheist, she asked, or a Muslim? The Catholic lawyer was 
abrupt in response: "Wasted oil and a wistful prayer." The answer has haunted 
Mojtabai. Now, in a sort of exorcism, she has written a novel predicated on the 
scenario. Only it's not really a novel; more an extended vignette, an 
abstraction, fascinating, full of earth tones and grace notes but lacking in 
structure. An airliner has crashed in a field just outside Bounds, a small town 
of "West Texas grit and grind"; a town with the patience of its flatness. 
Bodies everywhere and parts of bodies. Some survivors. In principle, the novel 
deals with the reaction of humdrum hamlet to calamity. In practice, it does not 
play out that way. Surely the town is defined by more than a priest, a 
postmistress, a retarded kennel keeper and a disillusioned drifter come home. 
In the end, though, the scant story belongs to the unnamed priest, a reluctant 
religious who finds his calling among the pilgrims to the site, relatives, 
friends, many who don't speak English. "She talked -- I listened. Maybe she 
thought I understood. Maybe I did." A power like that deserves better.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; KCAL'S 'BOOGIE'S DINER' IS THE NEW 
HANGOUT FOR HANGING-OUT CROWD

 Brandon, Brenda, Kelly and Dylan may have piled into the Peach Pit, but 
there's a new hangout in teen town: Boogie's Diner. 
</P>
<P>
 A kind of "Beverly Hills, 90210" and "Saved by the Bell" hybrid with some 
"Facts of Life" thrown in, the syndicated series centers on a diner/store and 
the seven teens who work there. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast includes Jason (Jimmy Marsden), "resident hunk" with a Boy Scout's 
code of honor; Cynthia (Robin Stapler), a perky waitress; Cheryl-Ann (Joy 
Tanner), who's described as having unlimited credit but a limited personality; 
Zoya (Monika Schnarre), who's 6-foot-1 and beautiful; Tymp, the store's deejay 
and mix master; Kirby (Zack Ward), the strange chef; and Gerald (Jim J. 
Bullock), the hysterical store manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not offensive in any way," says producer Tim Williams from the show's 
set in Toronto. "Parents aren't going to be horrified their kids are watching 
this stuff. It's morally refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Chevolleau, who plays the cool, witty and ultra-hip Tymp, says: "Kids 
can relate to the characters. There's a broad spectrum of characters for 
different tastes. It's also very funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams adds: "It's nothing too heavy and in no way does it ever carry a bad 
message. It's a sitcom for teens and kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Chevolleau agrees that the show avoids the negative: "There's always some 
positive message to each show." 
</P>
<P>
 "Boogie's Diner" airs Sundays , beginning Sept. 25 , at noon on KCAL. A 
preview of the show aired Saturday. For ages 5 and up. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 "Fantasy Island" showed some adults what it would be like to fulfill dreams of 
a different life. Many kids, on the other hand, prefer a great sports fantasy. 
Enter GUTS, now in its third season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids get to live out their greatest sports fantasies," explains Albie Hecht, 
executive producer of "GUTS" and Nick's vice president of production and 
development, from his New York office. "They get to jump higher than Michael 
Jordan or out-hurdle a horse or set a world record. It's an Olympic-style 
competition. It's really about kids and their personal best." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids ages 10 to 14 compete in obstacle-style courses to climb through the 
Agro-Crag, "a living, breathing volcanic mountain." The new season offers the 
Mega-Crag and 38 new shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Also new this season is what Hecht calls "International GUTS," featuring six 
kids flown in from Great Britain by Nickelodeon U.K. 
</P>
<P>
 "GUTS", he adds, "is a real gender-buster. The boys and girls compete on equal 
footing." 
</P>
<P>
 The sports-oriented obstacle-course show offers a trophy as its main prize -- 
not money or goods. "We also give medals, gold, silver and bronze," he says. 
"Just like the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nickelodeon GUTS" airs Saturday at 6:30 p.m. on Nickelodeon. For ages 5 and 
up.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, KTLA began a new fall season for syndicated rebroadcasts. Channel 
5's "Way Cool Weekdays" lineup now includes Doogie Howser, M.D. (5 p.m.) and 
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (7 p.m.). "Doogie" offers a comic look at a 
brilliant 16-year-old doctor, and Will Smith takes his easygoing rapper persona 
to Bel-Air in "Fresh Prince," which still airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on NBC. Also 
featured are Family Matters (5:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.) and Full House (6 p.m.). 
For ages 7 and up.  
</P>
<P>
 Also added to the fall programming are repeats of Beverly Hills, 90210, (4 
p.m.) with its focus on a group of teens who live and love in that swanky town. 
For ages 13 and up.

COMMENTARY; WHEN TALK SHOWS GO THUMP IN THE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This TV season, Marilu Henner has her own talk show, ex-Thighmistress Suzanne 
Somers has her own talk show and oodles of other people -- I get a max of 700 
words here so I can't mention all of them -- have talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 So it got me thinking: Who doesn't have a talk show? Why, my Holland lop, 
Pookie. 
</P>
<P>
 A rabbit? you snicker. Why not. She has plenty of whatever it takes to make a 
splendid talk-show host. 
</P>
<P>
 She's adorable (one of the cutest twitching noses around). She can be 
aggressive (nothing stands between her and a Granny Smith apple). She can be 
probing (watch as she paws her way through a pile of blankets). And she won't 
become one of those prima donna talk-show hostesses, bickering about her salary 
(just keep those apples coming and there won't be any trouble). 
</P>
<P>
 But who, you ask, would appear on her show? And what, you wonder, would they 
ever talk about? 
</P>
<P>
 Next, on "Pookie": 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Obnoxious, You're Obnoxious!": An exclusive interview with the Energizer 
Bunny includes a visit to the forest, where a secret sect of male rabbits, 
called Blybunnies, cry and beat drums and whine, "Why doesn't my doe understand 
me?!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Alice in Woozyland!": The White Rabbit tells all in the tell-all best-seller, 
"Alice Dearest." 
</P>
<P>
 "I Had 20 Rabbits in a Single Litter!": Five mother rabbits and their 100 
toddler bunnies take over the "Pookie" set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Cleaned Up After 105 Rabbits!": Janitors take TV viewers on a sweeping tour 
of the "Pookie" set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playboy Bunnies Reunion!": What's life like after The Centerfold? Former 
bunnies talk about their days of running around the garden of the Playboy 
mansion. "If we wanted carrots, Hef gave us carrots. If we wanted lettuce, Hef 
gave us lettuce," says four-time centerfold, Flopsie. (Of course, Flopsie will 
be flogging her new video out next spring, "Finding Your Inner Bunny.") 
</P>
<P>
 "My Hysterectomy!": In a poignant interview with herself, Pookie discusses 
when she was fixed, why she was fixed, how she was fixed, where she was fixed 
and who fixed her. "Best thing that ever happened to my owner," she says, "uh, 
and to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabbit Reincarnation!": Pookie and guest Dionne Warwick make contact with all 
the dead rabbits from "Watership Down." 
</P>
<P>
 "When Rabbits Fly!": The pros and cons of dwarf rabbit tossing are debated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't We All Just Get Along?": Holland lops, French lops and English lops 
hurl insults ("Your mother has paws!") and call each other terrible, terrible 
names including, "You long-eared varmint." 
</P>
<P>
 "So Who Killed Roger Rabbit?": Pookie goes underground in this special 
investigative report and finds lots of intrigue, as well as tunnels burrowed by 
rabbits, gophers and moles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Threats! Threats! Threats!": Famed psychologist Dr. Benjamin Bunny tells pet 
owners that it does no good to threaten an ornery rabbit with a stewpot. "Pet 
rabbits! You can keep 'em," he says. "Tougher than rubber bands, they are." 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting Over!": Rabbits who've found second careers as business owners. Show 
includes a visit to the Hair and Tortoise Beauty Salon. Its motto: "If you're 
in a rush, go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Billions of Bunnies of Madison County!": Pookie reports live from 
conservative Madison County, where she interviews the billions of bunnies there 
about birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gang Bunnies!": Thumper, Buck and Ben Gee Man rap with Pookie about life in 
the hutch. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Williams is deputy editor of Life & Style.

 FULL HOUSE: Reassessing the Earth's Population Carrying Capacity by Lester R. 
Brown & Hal Kane (Norton: $8.95; 261 pp., paperback original) and POPULATION 
POLICY: A New Consensus by Robert Cassen with Lisa M. Bates (Overseas 
Development Council/ 1875 Connecticut Ave. N . W . , Suite 1012 , Washington, 
D.C. 20009: $9.95, plus $3. handling; 92 pp., paperback original). The world 
population has risen from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 5.6 billion today, and may 
reach 8.3 billion by 2025. Cassen and Bates present a rational program aimed at 
curbing this precipitous growth: The industrialized nations must provide Third 
World countries with sufficient aid to promote the socio-economic development 
that will reduce the desire for large families and reduce the unmet need for 
family planning. Brown and Kane document the impossibility of adequately 
feeding an additional 90 million human beings every year. The resources of the 
Earth are finite: Many areas of food production have already peaked or are 
being maintained at unsustainable levels as the amount of land under 
cultivation shrinks due to industrialization, aquifer depletion, erosion, 
greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation and pollution. Despite the specious 
arguments of conservative Moslem and Vatican speakers at the recent conference 
in Cairo, these books make it clear that unless population growth is checked, 
all life will be treated with decreasing sanctity in the coming decades as 
record numbers succumb to starvation, disease and struggles over food supplies.

ON THE TOWN: A GOOD TEACHER PASSES; SHE RECOGNIZED THE TRUE NATURE OF THIS 
MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITY BEFORE IT KNEW IT HAD BECOME ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Jonathan Gold

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the day our first child is due to be born, I am sitting in the living room, 
crooning to the baby's elbows that jut out of my wife's belly, pretty much 
cleaving to what must have been the last air-conditioner for sale in Los 
Angeles this summer. Laurie reads aloud from a baby book, one of the dozens 
we've accumulated, with section headings including "Big Changes," "The Real 
Meaning of Discipline" and "Rx for Inconsolable Crying." By the couch, jumpers, 
onesies and impossibly tiny booties are heaped in a snowdrift of shower 
presents. Life is good. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking about babies all the time, I feel closer to my own parents, entirely 
too late. My father died two years ago, my mother just this spring. Hardly an 
hour goes by when I do not still reach for the phone to dial her number. She 
was going to teach me how to change a diaper. Plus, nobody knew children's 
books half so well. 
</P>
<P>
 She raised three generations of Los Angeles kids, both as mother to me and my 
brothers and in her quarter-century as the librarian for Dorsey High School, at 
the foot of the Baldwin Hills. It was impossible to accompany her anywhere in 
South-Central L.A. that somebody -- a waiter in a restaurant, an auto-repair 
guy, a young doctor -- didn't seem to feel as close to her as I did. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dorsey was 40% pupils of Japanese descent -- it's hard to remember how 
Asian the Crenshaw district was just a while ago -- she made sure that Tanizaki 
novels and books on Noh plays were in the library. As the school became more 
Central American, she tried to build up at least a basic collection in Spanish. 
Years before Peter Sellars discovered that Los Angeles was a multicultural 
city, a full decade before the district's multicultural mandates, she built up 
the high school's collection of African-American literature, often at her own 
expense. (In the world of post-Proposition 13 choices, library books have been 
less than high priority.) The couple of times a year a football player would 
bring a copy of "Black Beauty" up to the check-out counter, my mom would gently 
explain that the book was about a horse. 
</P>
<P>
 She coached the chess team to city championships, over schools traditionally 
as dominant in chess as Dorsey is in basketball, and she helped coach the 
Academic Decathlon team to a high finish unprecedented for an inner-city 
school. She considered herself a subversive force for literature, winning a few 
kids each year to the side of great writing, hooking hundreds more on horror 
novels and cheap romances, then moving them up into the hard stuff: Toni 
Morrison, J. D. Salinger, Richard Wright, Langston Hughes. When a New York 
rapper I was interviewing a couple of years ago told me that no white teacher 
ever did anything for a black student for any reason but money, I cringed. I'm 
not a violent guy, but I've always since regretted that I didn't smack the 
smirk off his face. 
</P>
<P>
 It had never been easy to teach at the school -- just last year she stumbled 
into the midst of a drive-by shooting on the campus front lawn -- and she 
fantasized for more than 20 years about a transfer. But in the end she felt she 
had to stay, through the violence, the drugs, the apathy of the district and 
the contempt of most of the students. 
</P>
<P>
 She hadn't been well. The chemotherapy she had been undergoing left her 
nauseated one week a month. But she had been talking about imminent death at 
least since I was in the fourth grade, and I suppose that nobody realized she 
was as sick as she really was. She was hospitalized briefly for what the 
doctors called anemia on the afternoon I found out my wife was pregnant. My 
mother held my hand and told me again that she was dying. I finally believed 
her that day. What was eating away at her ovaries wasn't cancer, but in three 
weeks she was dead, reduced to a hundred cartons of books and a pound or so of 
gritty, gray crematorium ash that my youngest brother and I scattered into 
Santa Monica Bay.

 SPIDER TOWN by Abraham Rodriguez Jr. (Penguin: $9.95; 323 pp.). This powerful 
first novel depicts the efforts of a Puerto Rican teen-ager to escape the slums 
of New York.At 16, Miguel has already dropped out of school and received an 
education in evil on the streets of the Bronx. As a runner for an aspiring drug 
lord, he makes more money than he could hope to earn in a legitimate job, but 
he's too intelligent and sensitive to stomach the murderous subculture. 
Repulsed by the wanton cruelty and superficial loyalty of the drug scene, 
Miguel acquires two angels who assist in his reclamation: street-smart, savvy 
Amelia and lovely, intelligent Cristalena. Rodriguez etches his portrait of a 
young man in conflict with deadly accuracy, down to the slang and fractured 
syntax: "This ain't freedom. I'm just as chained down, ain't I. . . Maybe all 
these people can fool themselves into thinkin' they doin' good. I can't. Lookit 
these streets, man. We live like animals. There's gotta be somethin' better. 
An' I think I'm gonna go lookin' for it."

 A WALK ACROSS FRANCE by Miles Morland (Fawcett/Columbine: $10; 238 pp.) . At 
45, Morland dealt with his midlife crisis by giving up a lucrative job in 
international finance and making a 553-kilometer trek across France with his 
long-suffering wife. As they hike from Gruissan Plage (near Narbonne) on the 
Mediterranean to Capbreton (near Bayonne) on the Atlantic, Morland savors the 
traditional recipes and life style of Southern France, and endures the 
tasteless food and "boutiquified" communities that are replacing them. His 
expanded journal offers an agreeable armchair journey.

 THE COMFORTERS by Muriel Spark (New Directions: $10.95; 204 pp.). In this 
curious novel, Muriel Spark displays the kind of outre humor that leads people 
in other countries to shake their heads and declare, "There'll always be an 
England."The pleasant life of eccentric young BBC announcer Laurence Manders 
begins to crumble when he discovers his fiancee has begun hearing the voice of 
some omniscient Higher Author and his gypsy grandmother may be running a 
diamond smuggling ring. Their improbable adventures are complicated by the 
redoubtable Georgina Hogg, a pious busybody who makes virtue seem unattractive.

 THE MIDNIGHT FLUTE: Chinese Poems of Love and Longing, translated from the 
Chinese by Sam Hamill (Shambala: $11; 150 pp., illustrated, paperback 
original). Because the Imperial government forbade scholar-officials to serve 
in their native provinces, parting and separation became important motifs in 
Chinese poetry. This mini-anthology of Hamill's satisfying translations offers 
Western readers an overview of more than 1,000 years of verse. The poems tend 
to be allusive, formal and reserved in tone: Contemplating his own mortality, 
Li Po (701-762), wrote, "We sit together, the mountain and me,/ until only the 
mountain remains."

 MAGNIFICENT OBSESSIONS: Twenty Remarkable Collectors in Pursuit of Their 
Dreams by Mitch Tuchman, photographs by Peter Brenner (Chronicle: $19.95; 143 
pp., paperback original). During the '80s, the definition of a collectible was 
expanded to encompass anything someone was willing to have around the house in 
large quantities. These brief, up-beat interviews profile 20 people who collect 
a variety of off-beat objects, from Studebakers and carousel horses to aquarium 
figures and toy building sets. Their mania for accumulation seems usually seems 
harmless, but the woman who's amassed thousands of souvenir swizzle sticks may 
lead less sanguine readers to mutter, "Get a life!"

 TALES OF THE TIKONGS by Epeli Hau'oa (University of Hawaii Press: $9.95; 93 
pp., paperback original). Development with a capital D threatens to engulf the 
imaginary Polynesian island of Tiko in these darkly sardonic tales. British 
colonial policies and Sabbatarian missionaries have eroded the traditional 
customs of the Tikongs. But Hau'oa's characters play the game by their own 
time-sanctioned rules, much to the consternation of the Westerners with silly 
notions of efficiency, morality and progress: "The Lord moves one way, followed 
by Christians everywhere, and Tiko goes in the opposite direction, all on its 
own."

PALM LATITUDES: THE BIZ; STAGE FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I have no words,--My voice is in my sword 
</P>
<P>
 Those are fighting words, spoken by Macduff just before he parries with 
Macbeth and severs his head. It's one of Shakespeare's great fight scenes and 
it is rehearsed regularly at the Gascon Center for Stage Combat in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, founded six years ago as part of the Westside Fencing Center, is a 
favorite of Hollywood fight choreographers searching for talent. To showcase 
the school's two dozen students, Gascon stages fight performance nights that 
present historical and contemporary stage and film battles using broadswords, 
quarterstaffs, rapiers, daggers and whips. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gascon's four fight instructors teach historical accuracy, most 
choreographers want some "flash and dash," says instructor Ted Katzoff. "The 
way in which a person fights reveals much about their character on stage and 
certainly in real life -- but it's all about creating illusions," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the current warrior-wannabes is Geena Davis who Katzoff is teaching to 
wield a rapier, dagger and saber for "Cutthroat Island," a pirate film set in 
1650. The school also has taught swordplay to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, 
Robin Williams, Shelley Long, Keanu Reeves and Eric Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors who take Gascon's courses say a good thrust and parry adds dimension to 
their work. "It used to be part of an actor's training," says T.J. Rotolo, 28, 
who has done extra work. "I like Shakespeare, so it seemed natural to do this. 
Plus, I can't sing or dance, so this makes me more marketable." R. Daniel 
Foster

PAGE TO SCREEN; BOYD'S 'GOOD MAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CLARK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This fall, fans of author William Boyd are finally getting to see his 1981 
comic novel, "A Good Man in Africa," on the big screen. The movie, released 
recently by Gramercy Pictures, stars Colin Friels, Sean Connery, Diana Rigg, 
John Lithgow, and Louis Gossett Jr. Directed by Bruce Beresford ("Driving Miss 
Daisy") and scripted by Boyd, it jettison's the book's flashback narrative but 
retains most of its major plot points and characters, as well as some of its 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sixty to 70% of the average novel can't get into a film," says Boyd, who has 
adapted his own and others' work to the screen before. "It's all about editing, 
boiling down, looking for essence." 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly stated, the story concerns a boozy, morally bankrupt British consular 
official in a tiny African state who gets involved with the boss's daughter 
(and his wife), an unscrupulous local politician (and his wife), and a Scottish 
doctor of staggering rectitude. The doctor, Alex Murray, is the "good man" of 
the title, and the key to both the book and the movie. Boyd modeled him after 
his late father, a Scottish physician who had worked in Africa. Sometime after 
the book was published, but long before a movie was even being considered, Boyd 
and Connery met, and the actor immediately became fixed in Boyd's mind as the 
perfect man to play Murray. Connery's subsequent participation in the project, 
which Boyd and friend Bruce Beresford began as an "experiment" (they had 
previously worked together on "Mister Johnson"), in turn helped get the film 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Connery also had a hand in shaping the character for the screen. Originally, 
Murray comes across as a rather dour, remote figure, but Connery, in 
consultation with Boyd, imbued him with his own wit, warmth and golf swing. 
</P>
<P>
 The other character whose edges were slightly sanded is the consular official, 
Morgan Leafy. In the book, he's fat and freckled, with a receding hairline. 
But, as Boyd says, "you have to be ruthless about how your film is going to 
work," and it was only going to work with someone more presentable. Beresford 
hit upon fellow Australian Colin Friels ("Class Action"), much to Boyd's 
delight. "Colin Friels has a slightly bashed, slightly lived-in face, but he 
has that affable quality," Boyd says. "Somebody you could sympathize with, but 
not exactly Tom Cruise." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd has no idea whether the book's many fans will object to the changes, 
large and small. "It's terribly unfair to judge a film by the book," he says, 
"because the film will always come out second best." In this case, because the 
filmmakers couldn't quite find a visual equivalent to the book's wonderful, 
corruscating language, he's right.

PALM LATITUDES: THE WORD; HOLLYWOOD BIBLIOPHILIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joseph Hanania 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a recent weekend, a dozen books lay on a table just inside the Heritage 
Book Shop on Melrose Avenue. Ranging from Alexis de Tocqueville's "Democracy in 
America" (in French) to Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven and Other Poems," the 
mostly first-edition books were worth well over $1 million.And there are 22,000 
more volumes where they came from. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a neighborhood known more for rubber dresses and leather jock 
straps than literature. And it's not just Melrose -- Heritage is merely one of 
more than 50 Southern California stores specializing in rare books and 
manuscripts. Other notables include Lorson's Books and Prints in Fullerton, and 
Krown & Spellman Bookseller and Kenneth Karmiole Bookseller in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 So pronounced is the literati boom that even a reporter for the New York Times 
recently named Heritage as "the best rare-book store I've ever been in." 
Similarly, Selby Kiffer, Sotheby's vice president of rare books and 
manuscripts, said first editions of modern poetry, science fiction, and 
original movie scripts are "'more abundant in California. Clearly, over the 
last 15 years, Los Angeles has emerged as New York's equal." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason even New Yorkers concede Los Angeles's newfound clout is simple: 
There are lots of people out here with lots of money. "The film industry has a 
lot of very literate people, with a large disposable income and an appreciation 
for history and literature," says Kenneth Karmiole. "These are the type who can 
appreciate a well-crafted story in its original." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm. That'd be news to screenwriters. Joseph Hanania

PALM LATITUDES: MIND AND BODY; BREATHING EASIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Mark Ehrman

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many people, the straw they hold in their mouth at the California Breath 
Center is the last one. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've gone to their dentist. They've gone to doctors. They've tried all the 
medicines and rinses, but nothing seems to work," says dentist Richard Katz, 
who, along with physician Jerry Jacobs, last March founded the only clinic on 
the West Coast dedicated to combating that bane of all social intercourse -- 
halitosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz says that 95% of the cases of chronic bad breath -- those not caused by 
such usual dietary suspects -- come from volatile sulfur compounds caused by 
bacteria that flourish because of poor dental hygiene, bad bridgework or a 
saliva deficiency. (The other 5% comes from conditions in the lungs, nasal 
passages, stomach and other areas; these patients are referred to the 
appropriate specialist.) 
</P>
<P>
 To determine the extent of the problem, patients exhale through a straw 
attached to a device that measures the sulfur fumes. Normal breath will ring up 
around 80; anything over 130 is considered a problem, and some patients have 
clocked in at more than 400, a level that can be apparent across a room. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the germs that produce the sulfur compounds often resist the usual 
toothpaste/floss/mouthwash treatment, Katz gives patients a special toothpaste 
and rinse. Available only to dentists, they contain chlorine dioxide, which 
virtually sterilizes the mouth. "Patients who properly brush, floss and brush 
their tongue and use the rinse and paste should be fine in four to six weeks,' 
" Katz says. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for a complete dental check-up, X-rays, gum evaluation, treatment and 
followup isn't cheap (around $450). But for the hundred or so clients who've 
been bringing their malodorous breath to the center, located in L.A. on Pico 
near Beverly Glen, it's a small price to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the worst frustration and humiliation. I can't even put into words," 
says a Westside hypnotherapist who got her 400-plus breath down to sociable 
levels. 'I'm by nature very gregarious, charming and friendly and love people, 
so before this, I was somewhat uncomfortable." Not to mention her friends and 
clients. Mark Ehrman

OUT AND ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was excited to hear that Eileen Myles so effectively recites her essay, "My 
Father's Alcoholism," from memory ("It's Been Said," in Michelle Huneven's 
column "Out and About," Aug. 14). 
</P>
<P>
 Trained as a musician, I have always valued memorized performances: They are 
more likely to be direct and heartfelt than readings. What distressed me was 
the comment by writer Michelle Huneven, who was "relieved to have the old 
familiar page conventionally lodged between reader and audience" when Miles 
ended her memorized portion and began reading from the printed page. During 
what is no doubt a stirring autobiographical piece, is relief the goal of an 
auditor? 
</P>
<P>
 My local Barnes & Noble hosts twice-monthly poetry nights. Participants bring 
their own and others' works; a few of us make the effort to memorize our 
presentations, and the effect is always well-received and powerful. There is a 
sense of deep knowing (in audience and reciter) when confronting a piece from 
memory; it is easier to convey a personal understanding to an audience when it 
has been given such attention. I hope that Huneven's comment, although 
undoubtedly genuine, doesn't discourage other writers from presenting their 
work "by heart." 
</P>

<P>
 I would like to take exception to Michelle Huneven's reporting of the Lannan 
Foundation reading by winners of the 1993 National Poetry Series contest. I was 
thrilled that someone was actually going to review a poetry reading that had 
not taken place at a coffeehouse and did not have any relationship whatsoever 
to celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 From the description of the contest provided by Huneven, it sounds like a 
thrilling honor and a genuine career boost to have been chosen as a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Huneven states that "traditional formal concerns" dominate these poet's work. 
What exactly are traditional formal concerns? Does she mean they're concerned 
with traditional form? Or that the poets' subject matter is traditional? Whose 
tradition is she referring to? 
</P>
<P>
 From Huneven's descriptions of the reading, I got a good idea of the range of 
topics covered by these poets; everything from love to AIDS to Laos to 
orangutan rehab centers. But I didn't get an idea of whether or not the poems 
were any good. Huneven says the Series has a reputation for selecting artists 
well worth reading. Are these new poets well worth reading? Did Huneven feel 
like she was on the high road to Taos as Martin Edmunds read? (By the way, were 
his clenched fists a political statement, a sign of nervousness, or a symptom 
of advanced arthritis?) Did the journalist's poems about Cambodian killing 
fields sound like journalism? 
</P>
<P>
 After reading Huneven's dry summation of each poet's contribution to the 
reading, the only poet whose work seems interesting to me is Young's. Anyone 
who says a hair-straightening comb smells like burning lilacs has my attention. 
</P>
<P>
 One more question. Why report that Karen Swenson is 50ish and that Rachel 
Wetzsteon is young and lanky, but not how old the three men are, or whether or 
not they're lanky? Just asking.

QUOTAS IN BOOK REVIEW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having for years, out of delightful necessity, twice read every review 
published in Book Review, I "view with alarm" what is suggested by the last 
paragraph of T. Bruce Graham's letter (Aug. 28). I would not care to have Book 
Review institute a quota system based on whether an author or reviewer is 
straight or gay, "butch" or "femme," and on an at best educated guess as to how 
many Review readers are of this or that inclination. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no objection to reading any number of reviews of books by, say, Tom 
Clancy, Rudyard Kipling, P.D. James or even Robert James Waller. I leave it to 
Graham not to be confused by the fact P.D. James sometimes wears tweed, English 
weather being what it is, and sensible shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Any literary publication or writer of reviews whose main aim is to please a 
presumed majority of readers is bound to ignore individual merit as much as do 
those who cater to an imagined elite. Were I a writer, I would not care to wait 
my turn. 
</P>
<P>
 FRED SCIFERS, DOWNEY 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 So reader T. Bruce Graham believes The Times is doing a disservice to its 
"readers of average, normal nature" by printing too many reviews of books about 
the "absurd," his euphemism for homosexuality. Graham should consider that the 
major newspaper of the western United States serves a community that 
encompasses interests broader than his and, if I may presume to speak for that 
broader community, desires to learn about subjects beyond his limited view of 
what constitutes average and normal. 
</P>
<P>
 If one finds the subject matter of a book review personally unappealing, one 
is under no obligation to read it in its entirety. To imply that the readership 
as a whole should be denied access to that which offends one group is the 
apotheoses of bigotry. Are gay and lesbian writers acceptable only when their 
work avoids gay-related themes? That The Times would dignify such a complaint 
by publishing Graham's letter (and giving it more column space than any other 
letter) is what I find offensive. Would the editors print objections to too 
many reviews of books concerning Muslims, Jews or African Americans?

 Regarding Peter Rainier's review of Alexander Theroux's "The Primary Colors" 
(August 28): 
</P>
<P>
 An art instructor years ago said that the reason Picasso went through his 
"Blue Period" was that blue was the cheapest pigment and Pablo didn't have much 
money at the time. So when I read the quote from Alexander Theroux's essay 
"Blue" saying that blue was always the most expensive pigment I had a good 
chortle.Also I remember spending more for vermilion than cobalt 20-30 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since reading Rollo May say in "The Cry for Myth" that Lindbergh flew the 
Atlantic in a biplane have I had as good a laugh at someone trying to be 
serious. Outside of politicians that is.

BRECHT'S SMOKESCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So Bertolt Brecht's works were written by his girlfriends ("Brecht & Company," 
Aug. 14)? After the death of writer Theodore Dreiser, the author of "An 
American Tragedy," "Sister Carrie," and "The Cowperwood Trilogy," critics 
similarly determined to erase Dreiser's genius from the public mind said the 
same thing about his girlfriends. Not only were Dreiser and Brecht great 
writers but apparently they both had a singular genius for picking girlfriends 
who knew how to write brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it a girlfriend who thought up Brecht's remark about no smoking? Brecht 
had been questioned first by the Gestapo in his native Germany, then by the 
House Un-American Activities Committee in the United States. After the HUAC 
testimony he said: "At least the Nazis let me smoke."

 I read Lee Wochner's review of "Brecht & Company" by John Fuegi with growing 
disbelief. I find the notion that talented women wrote his material, etc. and 
kept silent about it preposterous. All because he was so great in bed! The book 
shows (as is said in the review) that Brecht conned everybody everywhere 
without exception. Come on! This hatchet job aided and lauded by Wochner is 
just plain unbelievable. Motivation? Political? Or to cater to the present 
fashion of bashing all things left? Great money making while the iron is hot.

BRET 'THE REAL THING' ELLIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poor Bret Easton Ellis ("Attack of the Anti-Heroes," Aug. 21). He must endure 
the scathing attacks of the slumbering, half-witted journeymen, who promote 
their own ignorance via the vociferous attacks launched at his adroit, 
nerve-racking social criticism couched as fiction.They pretend that Camus, 
Hemingway and Fitzgerald were, um, original. That Thomas Wolfe wove a web of 
constant thematic and stylistic changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Face it: Bret's just too damn good, too damn young, too damn rich and too damn 
famous for the plethora of third-rate hacks to bear. In a city that wallows in 
slush, Bret has slashed through the schlock and image-gridlock with poignant, 
albeit static, pizazz. He has a voice, a vision, and a conscious -- things 
critics don't grasp until after they've gained tenure and their thesis concerns 
the dead. Wail away, you dumbfounded bottom-feeders. You're either too busy, 
too inebriated, too old, too bloated or too immersed in your umpteenth unheeded 
treatment to celebrate the wherewithal of true talent. 
</P>
<P>
 If you find yourself one of the puny, clamoring for Bret to write more 
interesting novels, you'd be better off devoting your time to becoming better 
subject matter.

ON THE RECORD: KODALY, THE OTHER HUNGARIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert Glass, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inevitably, Bela Bartok's is the name mentioned first when discussing 
Hungarian compos ers of the 20th Century. Zoltan Kodaly, his friend, colleague 
and contemporary -- although he outlived Bartok by 22 years -- is usually "the 
other guy." Outside Hungary, at any rate. 
</P>
<P>
 While there can be little doubt that Bartok was the innovative genius, Kodaly 
is hardly any less important as a national father figure -- he showed equal 
contempt for fascism and communism, surviving and prevailing over both regimes 
-- and as an ethnologist and educator. The so-called Kodaly Method, which 
promotes universal musical literacy through group singing, has found wide 
acceptance in many countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodaly's assimilable, tuneful and superbly crafted compositions are 
paradoxically much less familiar than Bartok's more abstruse, dissonant ones. 
Kodaly (1882-1967), the younger man by one year, was a populist, like the 
Copland of the ballets, a situation that confounds the programming mavens: Do 
you put him on pops programs or is he too "foreign" for that? Then again, is he 
too easy for "serious" programs? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that we rarely hear Kodaly's orchestral music in concert at all, 
while his much less audience-friendly chamber music is neglected perhaps 
because it isn't by Bartok. The world seems capable of embracing only one 
Hungarian composer at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, the Lord created recordings, with some of the best ones of Kodaly's 
music being of very recent vintage, a list headed by a collection of his major 
orchestral works on a small, classy Danish label, Kontrapunkt (32153/4, two 
CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 The set offers polished and quite stunningly idiomatic performances from an 
expatriate Hungarian conductor named Janos Furst, who directs the Helsinki 
Philharmonic -- not normally a glamour ensemble but giving a convincing 
impression of one during these rewarding two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Furst and his sensitive engineers see to it that the scores make their pungent 
rhythmic points and that Kodaly's colorful orchestration is not only clearly 
but realistically projected. 
</P>
<P>
 The most familiar work is the composer's own enduringly clever suite from his 
folk opera "Hary Janos," and it is given its due here. Even more impressive, 
however, is the stirring and neglected (by conductors and by the big labels) 
"Peacock" Variations, which hasn't sounded this sumptuous since the memorable 
mid-1960s edition by the London Symphony conducted by the tragically 
short-lived Istvan Kertesz. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovely and lovable as well is the present version of the Dances From Galanta 
(1933), its melting clarinet solos played with soaring grace and dollops of 
authentic Magyar rubato by the Finnish orchestra's uncredited principal. 
</P>
<P>
 The present artists also offer eloquent readings of the sweetly beguiling 
"Summer Evening," begun in 1906 but not reaching its final form until 1930, 
when the composer dedicated it to Arturo Toscanini, and the rather wan, 
three-movement Symphony, started in the 1920s and not completed until 1961, 
again dedicated to Toscanini, this time in memoriam . 
</P>
<P>
 K odaly's chamber works tend to be tough nuts, although still a long way from 
Bartok's in terms of dissonance and rhythmic complexity. The most ambitious of 
them is the First String Quartet, completed in 1909 -- at the height of his 
folk-music collecting partnership with Bartok -- and rarely heard, even on 
recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 One strike against it is its three-quarter-hour length. But granting the 
excesses of youth and the lingering Romantic notion that bigger is better, it 
remains a fascinating, often gorgeous beast, shot through with Eastern 
exoticism and the Debussy-like shimmer found in the roughly contemporaneous 
"Bluebeard's Castle" by Bartok. 
</P>
<P>
 The Second Quartet, written nearly a decade later, is briefer, darker 
emotionally and more consistent in its working of the folk idiom into a 
coherent structure, if not quite as charmingly effusive as its predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are presented with rhythmic punch and lyric expansiveness by the 
excellent Copenhagen-based Kontra Quartet, comprising a Hungarian first 
violinist and three Danes (BIS 564).*

OUT OF THE VAULTS; THE SUN LEGACY IN 74 SONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 *****; VARIOUS ARTISTS, "The Sun Record Collection" ( Rhino ) 
</P>
<P>
 If Sun Records had begun in 1954 with Elvis Presley, it could still lay claim 
to the title of the greatest rock 'n' roll label. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legacy of Sun began five years earlier, when Sam Phillips decided to 
open a small Memphis studio to record local talent -- including future Rock and 
Roll Hall of Fame members Howlin' Wolf, B. B. King and Ike Turner -- and sell 
the tracks to such established labels as Chess. 
</P>
<P>
 The first disc in this invaluable three-disc, 74-song set focuses on that 
period, starting with such pre-Sun Phillips recordings as Jackie Brenston's 
landmark "Rocket 88" and including Junior Parker's original "Mystery Train." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips started the Sun label in 1952, leading to a treasured body of work 
that stands as the defining moment when Southern blues, country and gospel 
roots blossomed into rock 'n' roll. Presley would be followed at Sun -- and 
into the Hall of Fame -- by such seminal artists as Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee 
Lewis, Roy Orbison and Carl Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything Phillips touched turned to gold; many of the some three-dozen 
artists featured in the set have been long forgotten. In virtually every 
selection, however, you hear the ambition and desire of artists who were 
encouraged to put a liberating spark of individuality into their music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money, fame, none of this jazz gets in my way of knowing the greatest thing 
on this earth is being able to feel something," Phillips says in the liner 
notes, underscoring a Sun philosophy that could serve as a rock credo. "That's 
the greatest freedom in the world. That's what I wanted my records to do." 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). A five-star rating is reserved for 
outstanding reissues and compilations.

THE CHARTS: MORE 'ROMANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexican crooner Luis Miguel's "Segundo Romance" continues to be one of the 
dominant albums on the Times' Southern California pop chart, landing at No. 7. 
Some predicted a big drop-off, dismissing last week's No. 5 debut as an 
aberration. But the two-notch descent is fairly insignificant. Miguel's album 
is the clear leader on the Latin album chart, both in Southern California and 
nationally. Another unusual Top 10 entry, that live "3 Tenors" pop-classical 
album is also still doing strong business.

RECORD RACK: THE SECOND TIME JUST GETS BETTER

<P>
 ****; LIZ PHAIR, "Whip-Smart" ( Matador ) 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Phair is back with a highly anticipated second album after catching the 
attention of the indie-rock world with last year's provocative debut, "Exile in 
Guyville." 
</P>
<P>
 That album was structured after the Rolling Stones' "Exile on Main Street," 
Phair's lyrics answering the Stones' lines song by song. Her individual and 
female perspective hit a chord with listeners and put the Chicago-based artist 
at the top of the critics' polls around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old now proves that she can thrive outside the familiar structure 
of a classic album. On "Whip-Smart" she takes up where "Guyville" left off, 
bringing us to date on what's been happening in her life -- love and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Phair opens the 14-track album with a song about a would-be one-night stand -- 
an experience dashed by her own timidity. Perhaps Phair is revealing this 
shyness to counter impressions of her that grew out of the forthright sexual 
subject matter on her last album. 
</P>
<P>
 She also sings lovingly about her new boyfriend ("Your eyelashes sparkle like 
gilded grass, and your lips are sweet and slippery like a cherub's bare wet 
ass") as well as her struggles with new insecurities ("You're not satisfied 
looking at me, you're always checking out the girl behind."). 
</P>
<P>
 Phair's voice still hits those characteristically flat notes that make her 
unique and real as an artist, stretching for rich lows and then unreachable 
highs. As her voice wavers between those dimensions, it reveals myriad emotions 
as well as striking harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Her tunes go from the simplicity of "Chopsticks" to the groovy, Monkee-esque 
shimmy of "Jealousy" to the hypnotic, jump-roping rhythms of the title tune. 
</P>
<P>
 There are all sorts of surprising hidden effects -- from a cacophony of jungle 
noises to a groovy '60s vibe to an almost crispy hiss. Producer Brad Wood plays 
a lot of the music too, pitting slightly askew instrumentation against Phair's 
guitar work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whip-Smart" is a brilliant sophomore effort that confirms Phair as a 
revolutionary force rather than just a girlie phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>

stars (good) and four stars (excellent). Lorraine Ali

 * 1/2; LUTHER VANDROSS, "Songs" ( Epic ) 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to hear how not to sing some oldies, check out this album. 
Vandross covers a great list of songs -- mostly pop and R&B ballads -- but 
strikes out on almost all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 He performs songs such as "Killing Me Softly," "Evergreen" and "What the World 
Needs Now" in a draggy, dirge-like style, draining the energy out of them. He 
never alters his style or approaches the material in an innovative way. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandross never really did know how to swing. There's a stiffness in his style 
and a terseness in his tone that are positively deadly to up-tempo material. 
Fortunately, he doesn't sing much of that on this album, but he does lumber 
though the giddy McFadden & Whitehead dance tune "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now." He 
also gives a leaden feel to the normally joyous "Love the One You're With," 
undercutting a breezy, gospel-style arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 That schlock classic "Endless Love" -- a duet with Mariah Carey -- is the only 
song on the album that generates much excitement. Carey does some gritty, 
straight-ahead crooning, without too many of her usual vocal gymnastics. Still, 
it can't touch the original by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross. 
</P>

 ***; SEBADOH, "Bakesale" ( Sub Pop ) 
</P>
<P>
 Sebadoh's past seven albums and countless obscure singles and EPs have 
established the Amherst, Mass., trio as indie-rock sweethearts, charming fans 
with bittersweet, emotional, easygoing tunes. On "Bakesale," the band (which 
plays the Roxy on Oct. 7) again delivers great pop songs inside rough and messy 
packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 The band members trade off instruments, songwriting duties and vocals as 
usual, with founder Lou Barlow (former bassist of Dinosaur Jr.) and Jason 
Lowenstein doing the main body of work. 
</P>
<P>
 The album isn't as immediately charismatic as last year's "Bubble and Scrape," 
but it soon warms into a catchy collection of mouthwatering melody, woolly 
guitar reverb and stripped-down vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of who's singing, words are important to Sebadoh, so you can hear 
almost every one. Most songs seem to be about broken love, but that may be 
because Sebadoh just seem like the kind of nice guys who'd get kicked around.

 ** Changing Faces, "Changing Faces," Big Beat/Atlantic. While the coy 
suggestiveness of "Stroke You Up" and the soft-focus dreamscape of "Come Close" 
are attractive, the debut album by this female R&B vocal duo, partially 
produced by R. Kelly, is bogged down by too much kitten-soft compliance.Even a 
hissing display of defiance on "Good Thing" and "Move On" fail to broaden this 
record's one-dimensional appeal.

 ***; SPEARHEAD, "Home" ( Capitol ) 
</P>
<P>
 On his past efforts, with the groups the Beatnigs and the critically lauded 
Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, the street poetry of Spearhead's Michael 
Franti was couched in punk, thrash and industrial grooves that were punctuated 
with elements of hip-hop. With "Home," the debut album from his latest group, 
the music is a more accessible blend of rap, R&B and folk. 
</P>
<P>
 Many rap artists invoke the name of Gil Scott-Heron when citing primary 
influences, but few have a claim as valid as Franti's. Possessing a deep, 
caramel-smooth voice that resembles the elder word-man's, Franti pushes the 
similarity even further with his socially themed lyrics. Tackling issues such 
as AIDS, racism, social apathy and poverty, Franti uses both fierce 
intelligence and compassion to blur the lines between personal and universal 
concerns. In the past, his wordiness often drifted into preachiness. With 
"Home," however, he tempers the politics with a real soulfulness, securing his 
position as one of hip-hop's brightest hopes.

 "I've never seen it," confesses Mann, whose "That's Just What You Are" is the 
opening track on the album. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did Mann give her song to the collection? 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked who else was on it and they said Paul Westerberg, so I said, 'great,' 
" she says. "Then I asked friends if they watched the show, and people who said 
they did (watch it) were pretty cool, so that was my research." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, who is in Boston working on her second solo album, says she still has no 
idea how well her song, which features background vocals by Squeeze's Chris 
Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, fits into the show's beautiful Hollywood people 
theme.  
</P>
<P>
 "I leave that up to the producers," she says. "If they feel it has something 
to do with any sort of plot point, then great. Better my music than someone 
else's." 
</P>
<P>
 The album is due in stores Oct. 18 from Giant Records. Steve Hochman

 ***; ANITA BAKER, "Rhythm of Love" ( Elektra ) 
</P>
<P>
 This side of Sade, there's no woman in pop music with a more sensual sound 
than Baker's. While not as instantly irresistible as "Rapture" -- still her 
best album to date -- this record's sultry charms grow on you with each 
listening.The smoky-voiced, dramatic shading she brings to "Baby" and "The 
Wrong Man" should thrill Baker fans who have been missing her tasty way with a 
strong melody. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, the treatment she gives to such well-known chestnuts as "The Look 
of Love" and "My Funny Valentine" is unremarkable. And her version of "You 
Belong to Me" is no more emotionally charged than Carly Simon's. Baker fares 
better on fresh material that she had a hand in herself, like "I Apologize," a 
torch song she co-wrote that smolders convincingly. 
</P>
<P>
 While young upstarts like Toni Braxton will undoubtedly continue to give her a 
run for her money, Baker's position as one of pop's brightest talents is still 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 AND THE WINNER IS . . . : One of the fiercest competitions among pop managers 
in recent years has ended with red-hot Toni Braxton tabbing the team of Arnold 
Stiefel and Randy Phillips to work with her. She joins a roster there that also 
includes Rod Stewart, Morrissey and Patty Smyth. 
</P>
<P>
 Braxton's 1993 debut album, "Toni Braxton," has sold more than 5 million 
copies and earned three Grammys, including best new artist. Other managers who 
had reportedly been in the running included Sandy Gallin and Jim Morey (Michael 
Jackson's managers), Howard Kaufman (Janet Jackson) and Allen Kovac (Meat Loaf, 
Richard Marx). 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason she chose Arnold and Randy was after months of consideration she 
felt that's where she would get the most personal attention and full focus," 
says Bert Padell, the singer's business manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is now making plans for Braxton to begin work on her second album in 
time for release next summer, with a tour to follow. Among the plans on the 
Stiefel-Phillips drawing board for Braxton: movies and television. Steve 
Hochman

 Michael Jackson was very in volved with the second release from his MJJ 
Records, the album "From the Bottom Up" by the female vocal trio Brownstone, 
due in late October. He's the executive producer and was in the studio during 
some of the recording. Another MJJ release will come about the same time: a rap 
album by Quo, consisting of two pre-teen boys, one Australian and one African 
American. The first MJJ album, "Nathan," by the 12-year-old Australian 
blues-guitar wiz Nathan Cavaleri, just came out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Breeders' Kim Deal did a version of the old Everly Brothers song "Love 
Hurts" with Bob Pollard of the band Guided by Voices for the soundtrack of the 
upcoming movie "Love and a .45." Rev. Horton Heat appears in the movie and is 
also on the soundtrack album, due Oct. 4. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look for Luther Vandross to begin touring around the end of the year in 
support of his new album of covers, "Songs," due in stores Tuesday. . . . While 
the trend is to stick new songs on a "greatest hits" collection to help sell 
it, a collection due from Sade next month will be all previously released 
material. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Besides having his own "I Love Everybody" album due in stores Sept. 27, Lyle 
Lovett has been producing demos for Kelly Willis in preparation for her next 
album, as well as sessions for longtime Texas singer-songwriter Eric Taylor. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 The latest from Weird Al Yankovic: "Headline News," a song parodying media 
feeding frenzies to the tune of Crash Test Dummies' "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm." The song 
will be on "Permanent Record: Al in a Box," a four-CD (!) anthology that's due 
Sept. 27. A "Headline News" video is coming soon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We've heard of independent bands, but the German industrial group Laibach has 
taken it a step further: Along with fellow members of a utopian artists 
collective, the group has declared itself an independent state , called Neus 
Slowenische Kunst (NSK). A Laibach album, "NATO," is due Oct. 11. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nick Cave's first four albums, which have been out of print in the United 
States for several years, are being released on CD by Mute Records. The first 
album, "From Her to Eternity," will feature two bonus tracks: a version of the 
Elvis Presley hit "In the Ghetto" and a 1987 revision of the album's title song 
that was used in Wim Wenders' movie "Wings of Desire." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A box set of early and rare Lemonheads material is in the works from the 
band's first label, the Boston-based Taang! Records. Among the tracks being 
considered are recordings of the band's first-ever concert and rehearsals from 
group leader Evan Dando's basement. Original member Corey Loog Brennan is 
writing extensive liner notes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Taang! Records will soon release CD versions of four early albums by seminal 
British techno band Spaceman 3. Spaceman founder Sonic Boom is working with the 
group E.A.R., which has an album coming soon from the L.A.-based Sympathy for 
the Record Industry label, and shows at the Troubadour next Sunday and the 
Foothill Club in Long Beach on Sept. 29.

JAZZ SPOTLIGHT; A HARMONIC CONVERGENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
 **; MCCOY TYNER-BOBBY HUTCHERSON, "Manhattan Moods" ( Blue Note ) 
</P>
<P>
 No surprises here. Keyboardist Tyner and vibist Hutcherson have teamed before, 
but "Manhattan Moods" pairs them one-on-one in a gentlemanly session where each 
is careful not to step on the other's toes.This makes for a sweet harmonic 
convergence -- their respective instruments are tonally compatible, especially 
when Hutcherson moves to the woody sounds of marimba -- and the two take full 
advantage of this sonic match made in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a little too much mutual admiration in their approach, with each 
doing little to stir the other. Tyner's accompaniment is broad yet predictable 
and Hutcherson responds with lines that, despite a polite beauty, do little to 
expound on the familiar themes of "Blue Monk," Mal Waldron's "Soul Eyes" or "I 
Love You Porgy." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyner's best moments come solo as he weaves through the themes with his 
trademark looping phrases and chordal climbing. Still, he shows little of his 
fiery side and the recording suffers for it; Hutcherson, unquestionably the 
best mallet slinger of his generation, could stand a good jump start at times. 
This pretty collection may be fine for late nights and low lights, but wouldn't 
do much to get your motor running come morning. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 DEAD CALM: It's a Deadhead's dream . . . and a Dead-hater's nightmare: Toronto 
producer John Oswald combed through 25 years worth of live recordings of the 
Grateful Dead's "Dark Star" -- perhaps the group's most-loved and most-dreaded 
spacey excursion -- and, using a process he calls Plunderphonics, edited pieces 
of different performances into a seamless, hour-long piece he's titled 
"Grayfolded." And, depending on your leanings, you can either rejoice . . . or 
run and hide: A second volume of the effort is due next year. Steve Hochman

 AND ONE MORE THING: How can radio play a song that has a key phrase -- not to 
mention a title -- that can't be said on radio? That's the pertinent question 
as Interscope Records has released a radio-only sampler from the "Natural Born 
Killers" soundtrack album featuring L7's song "S---list." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn McDonnell, alternative promotions representative at Interscope, admits 
that only some college stations may play the song, at least without bleeping 
the offending word."We're not going to sit here and tell people to play it," 
says McDonnell, who says the radio release was just meant to give programmers 
some selections drawn from the 27 songs on the album.  
</P>
<P>
 Gene Sandbloom, assistant programming director at KROQ, says it's unlikely at 
this point the song will find its way into the station's playlist. "We never 
say never around here and we've edited some pretty impossible songs in order to 
play them," says Sandbloom. "But we're not fans of editing." 
</P>
<P>
 KROQ is playing another "NBK" selection, though: The Cowboy Junkies' version 
of "Sweet Jane," which in this version includes bits of dialogue from the 
movie.*

 LONDON REPORT: Oasis, the Manchester-based quintet fronted by Liam Gallagher 
and his brother Noel, has broken the all-time British record for first-week 
sales of a debut album.  
</P>
<P>
 The group's "Definitely Maybe" sold 150,000 copies in its first week of 
release, breaking the previous record held by the much-hyped Frankie Goes to 
Hollywood's "Welcome to the Pleasure Dome" in 1984. Oasis' album entered the 
British album chart at No. 1, knocking off the new album by the Three Tenors. 
</P>
<P>
 The achievement is even more notable given that the album was released by the 
independent Creation label (it's also just been released in the U.S., where 
Creation is distributed by Epic Records). Anticipation for the album built 
after a succession of singles, "Supersonic," "Shakermaker" and "Live Forever," 
enjoyed increasing chart success, prompting frequent comparison to another 
Manchester band, the long-silent Stone Roses.  
</P>
<P>
 Among Oasis' keenest fans is the Lemonheads' Evan Dando, who has been 
attending the group's live shows and even played an unannounced solo opening 
set before an Oasis show last month. After the show, Dando stood on the roof of 
the venue, singing to fans as they left the building. (Oasis will be at the 
Whisky on Sept. 29.)

 * The London Suede has recruited unknown 17-year-old musician Richard Oakes to 
replace guitarist Bernard Butler, who walked out on the band toward the end of 
sessions for the upcoming "Dog Man Star" album. Oakes was called in for an 
audition after sending the band a tape in response to a press advertisement 
placed in the British music press. 
</P>
<P>
 * Johnny Depp stars in and directed a new video for former Pogues frontman 
Shane MacGowan. The video, for a song titled "That Woman's Got Me Drinking," 
features Depp as a drunken customer telling his troubles to barman MacGowan. 
The singer's real-life significant other, rock journalist Victoria Clarke, 
appears as the title woman, leaving with the MacGowan character at the end. 
Depp and MacGowan have been friends for a long time and MacGowan was one of the 
opening night performers at the actor's Sunset Strip club, the Viper Room. Dave 
Jennings, from London

CRITIC'S PICK: 'A FRIENDSHIP IN VIENNA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lynne Heffley 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This 1988 TV film is that rare pleasure -- a family film of maturity and 
substance.Based on Doris Orgel's book "Devil in Vienna," Richard Alfieri's 
sensitive teleplay chronicles a friendship between two 13-year-old girls -- one 
Jewish (Jenny Lewis), one Catholic (Kamie Harper) -- that endures through 
Germany's annexation of Austria in 1938. Without a breath of false 
sentimentality, Alfierei script reveals what childhood becomes in the face of 
oppression and what uncompromising integrity means in the name of friendship. 
Under Arthur Allan Seidelman's direction, the cast -- which includes Edward 
Asner and Jane Alexander -- is flawless (Disney Channel at 7 p.m., Monday at 3 
a.m.). Lynne Heffley

 John Dahl's terrific 1993 film noir brings to mind the Coen brothers' "Blood 
Simple," Carl Colpaert's "Delusion" and his own "Kill Me Again" in its clever 
plotting and wide-open spaces setting.Nice-guy Nicolas Cage (pictured) is just 
passing through the tiny Wyoming town of Red Rock when he's mistaken by a 
saloon proprietor (J.T. Walsh) for the Dallas hit man he's hired to rub out his 
wife (Lara Flynn Boyle). From this point on, Dahl and his brother Rick, who 
helped write the script, come up with imaginative plot twists and turns that 
not only heighten suspense but also reveal character. With Dennis Hopper as the 
real hit man (Cinemax Tuesday at 8 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

 Once again, French director Claude Sautet succeeds in finding surprisingly 
supple and involving romantic entanglements in the well-upholstered lives of 
the bourgeoisie.Gregarious and sure of himself, Maxime (Andre Dussolier), 
proprietor of a prestigious violin repair shop, has fallen rapturously in love 
with a beautiful young violinist (Emmanuelle Beart). But she and Maxime's 
employee (Daniel Auteuil, pictured), a meticulous, diffident craftsman, are 
apparently on the same wavelength. An excursion to some of the wilder shores of 
love and obsession, this 1993 release proves its statement, "feelings can't be 
demystified," with every scene (Cinemax Wednesday at 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; ABC'S SMOLLETTS AGREE LIFE 'ON THEIR OWN' IS NEVER A 
DRAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KLEID, Beth Kleid is a regular contributor to TV Times and Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's almost 6 on a Thursday night and the Smollett clan is having that age-old 
family debate: Will it be Tony Roma's or the Red Lobster? 
</P>
<P>
 Jurnee, the 7-year-old of the six-kid family, the one with her hair in natural 
ringlets and the impish smile, has already cast her vote for waffles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waffles for dinner?" her mother Janet grimaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner aside, there isn't much on which the Smollett gang disagrees. In this 
family, sibling rivalry is out, they'll tell you. "We love each other. We're 
really close," says Jazz, Smollett No. 2, to a chorus of "yeahs" from the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 JoJo, the eldest, agrees. "We get along really well -- people say it's 
amazing. We've been brought up to reject conflict. We think it's a waste of 
time to fight and argue," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, this brood isn't into brooding. They have better things to do -- like 
star in their own sitcom, ABC's "On Our Own," which was designed specifically 
for them. On the show, they play a family of kids left to fend for themselves 
when their parents are killed in a car crash. Well, not for themselves really. 
Aunt Jelcinda, their older brother (non-Smollett cast member Ralph Harris) in 
drag, plays guardian when the authorities are around in order to prevent the 
kids from being put in foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in addition to sharing their parents Janet and Joel, a devotion to Whitney 
Houston and their good looks, the Smollett kids have a very large dressing 
room, strewn with toys, on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, where "On Our Own" 
is filmed. 
</P>
<P>
 And in addition to sharing the same initials -- there's JoJo, 17; Jazz, 14; 
Jussie, 12; Jurnee, 7; Jake, who is happily just 5 ("When I'm 6, I have to get 
shots," he reminds you), and Jacqui, 1, known as "the baby" -- they say they 
enjoy sharing the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 To Jurnee, now digging into a toaster waffle before dinner, the best thing 
about the show: "Being with my brothers and sisters." Aahh, cute, the others 
coo in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show's real fun because we know each other so well and can play comedy 
off each other," says talkative Jazz, who seems to be the family's designated 
speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the Smolletts ready for all the attention that could come their way -- 
other kids dressing like them, talking like them, swarming them? "Those are the 
types of problems we want," says brother Jussie from under a funky hat. 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't worried about turning out like some wayward former child stars. 
"We've been brought up to be real strong, so nothing can take us down," Jussie 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, they've worked hard for this moment. They started their careers when 
as young TV watchers in New York, they would see other kids on TV and think, 
"Oh, we can do that," Jazz recalls. With some help from Mom, they did. Jazz 
became a top child model, JoJo and Jussie did small movie roles and Jurnee did 
stints on sitcoms, including "Full House." 
</P>
<P>
 But their manager-mother Janet has taught them there's more to life than 
acting. Her kids play sports; they read. On the family reading list: "Malcolm 
X" and poetry by Langston Hughes. "Our mom just bought us a big ol' coloring 
book," Jake contributes to the others' laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 They also sing. A rap act is "in the works," Jurnee squeals, warning her 
family not to reveal too much. 
</P>
<P>
 JoJo's long-term goal is more political: "I want to run for President in 
2028." The soft-spoken, muscular adolescent might have to settle for teen-age 
idol of 1994.

 Jussie says they like having Mom around at work. "Mommy's a source of comfort

 Little Jake doesn't need much to be inspired. "I like everybody laughing when 
I say my jolly ol' lines," he mugs.

 And what does baby Jacqui think about being on TV? "C'mon Jacqui," the kids

THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN?

 Ken Burns has been miserable without professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like there's something missing in my life," he says with a sigh."I'm 
playing more baseball, which is nice, hitting balls and organizing scratch 
games. But I want my baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns doesn't know if the strike will hinder or help his documentary. "I think 
we will be the only game in town until they settle their differences," Burns 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose that could be looked at in a positive light and a negative light. I 
hope that those people who are angry and frustrated with the game will look at 
our series to get a sense of the complicated history of labor -- and to see a 
game that is much more glorious than the one that is not on the field now. If 
they're going to flock to it, great." SUSAN KING

FAMILY ACTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 I think it's fine that the Carpenters' songs are being re-evaluated and 
performed by a new generation of musicians ("Trust Us, This Is for Real," by 
Paul Grein, Sept. 11), but I take exception to Grein's assertion that "for a 
few years, (Karen Carpenter) did give Barbra Streisand a run for her money." 
</P>
<P>
 In what way? Perhaps for a brief time in the early '70s the Carpenters held 
the advantage in terms of radio airplay and hit singles, but once Streisand 
decided to take a more aggressive stance in the pop arena, her record sales 
held their own very nicely against the Carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the area of vocal prowess, as warm and appealing as Karen's voice was, 
it never approached the range, emotionalism, power or energy of Streisand's, 
whose skill as an actress has always placed her way out in front of the pack as 
an interpreter of lyrics both simple and complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying Carpenter gave Streisand a run for her money is tantamount to saying 
that Patti Page gave Judy Garland a rum for her money.

 Thank you for Grein's article. Let's hope some well-deserved recognition will 
come to this talented duo. 
</P>
<P>
 I would also like to point out a new record saluting another family act from 
the '70s -- the Bee Gees. "Melody Fair" features no fewer than 21 alternative 
bands paying tribute to one of the most grotesquely underrated acts in pop 
history.

 In Bronwen Hruska's article on the rigged quiz shows ("They Conned America," 
Aug. 28), the question that brought about Herbert Stempel's downfall is quoted 
as being: "Which movie won the Academy Award for best picture in 1955?" If that 
is how the question was actually phrased at the time, then Stempel answered 
correctly: "On the Waterfront." 
</P>
<P>
 On March 30, 1955, the Academy Awards were presented for the best achievements 
of 1954, and "On the Waterfront" was named the best picture."Marty" won the 
award for best picture of 1955 on March 21, 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 If the question were phrased "Which movie won the Academy Award for best 
picture of 1955?" then, indeed, Stempel's answer would be wrong. But as quoted 
in The Times, Stempel answered the question correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 RICK SANDFORD

 Reader Sandford is correct. The question, as read on "Twenty-One" and as 
depicted in the film, asked for the best movie of 1955.

WILLIAM HURT, ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More power to William Hurt for standing up to Hollywood and the bozos that run 
it. Thank goodness there are a few actors left who are still willing to take 
risks and who see acting as an art not a commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art, Commerce and Hurt," by Bronwen Hruska (Aug. 28), is one of the most 
inspirational, honest and retrospective interviews Calendar has ever produced. 
Hurt is still one of the finest, most provocative actors (not personalities) 
there is today despite Hollywood's banishment. Director Heywood Gould hits the 
nail on the head when he says, "Bill has something intangible. That's why you 
ask Bill Hurt to be in your movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's hoping to working with you one day, Bill!

 Hooray for William Hurt. He dares to use that dreaded word art when referring 
to his profession and his passion -- acting. How dare The Times even question 
his choice to act in small films that are "far from the blockbusters he so 
badly needs to catapult him back to his mid-'80s glory"? 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood is filled to the brim with people who are obsessed with the business 
end of filmmaking and all the hype that goes with it. Please leave the few 
brave ones alone, the few artists that still remain. 
</P>
<P>
 If more actors were like Hurt and turned down the dreck they were offered, 
then maybe we'd have films coming out of Hollywood that were good, artistic and 
made a profit. Well, I can dream, can't I?

 Frankly, I too was surprised that you printed my letter two weeks ago in 
response to "Natural Born Killers," but I can't deny the fact that I 
appreciated the opportunity to express myself in this kind of forum. 
</P>
<P>
 I have obviously made some people angry (Letters, Sept. 11).Well, good. I am 
angry too! 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans (especially black males) have been labeled every negative 
thing from A to Z. These angry individuals are just getting a small taste of 
what black people have been strangled with for over 400 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe these individuals will be able to appreciate the black person's position 
just a little bit because, when it's all said and done, no one likes to be 
called something they are not and no one wants to be lumped in a group when we 
are all individuals.

 I read in your Aug. 28 Theater Notes column that Theatre Corp. of America 
President David Houk has done a fairly bang-up job of fouling the subscription 
waters of both the Pasadena Playhouse and the Alex Theatre in Glendale, this by 
what appears to be an unfortunate combination of bad play and musical choices 
and "cash flow problems." 
</P>
<P>
 These allegations infuriated producer Irv Kimber of South Bay Cities CLO 
enough for him to send Houk an admonishing letter, part of which I quote: "With 
theater in general being in the rather precarious state that it is in right 
now, we certainly do not need someone 'spooking the herd' by bailing out on 
subscribers." 
</P>
<P>
 If these "producers" would spend less time mounting the tackiest revivals and 
spend more of their time and money ($200,000 borrowed from the city of 
Pasadena, for one) developing first-rate theater and especially stop thinking 
of the audience as cattle, then we all will fare a lot better than we have 
been.

 FIRST LADY: The Northridge Little Leaguers were thrown another curve -- this 
time by international diplomacy. They were to meet President Clinton this 
afternoon, but he got stuck in Washington overseeing the situation in Haiti.So 
the national champs will meet First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton when she lands 
at Burbank Airport. . . . "The team is very excited to have this opportunity," 
said publicist Paula Mort. "So am I!" 
</P>
<P>
 MANSIONS: For some, it's the American Dream. For others, it's a big house that 
doesn't belong. The problem is "mansionization" -- where large homes seem out 
of place in modest neighborhoods (B1). . . . Burbank is the latest city trying 
to balance the rights of property owners with the interests of the community. 
The City Council may tighten rules for single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 FASCINATING: Actor-director Leonard Nimoy (above) will be today's guest 
speaker at a ceremony inducting five test pilots into Lancaster's Aerospace 
Walk of Honor. Logical, isn't it? After all, who knows more about space travel 
than Mr. Spock? . . . Nimoy says the pilots, though not household names, "laid 
down the bricks and mortar for dreams."

<P>
 DELICIOUS: The seventh annual Taste of Encino continues today, serving up 
culinary delights from 25 Valley restaurants and six wineries. Saturday's crowd

great big bite," said Steve Mack of North Hills.

 THINGS CHANGE: CSUN President Blenda Wilson on Saturday defended her 
reorganization of a program to help minority students, saying it should 
increase the number who graduate. As it is, just 36% of Latino students and 28% 
of black students graduate within seven years. But some students and faculty 
say Wilson's changes are the first step toward dismantling the Educational 
Opportunity Program. (B3) MICHAEL ARKUSH

DREAM LEADS TO A PRISON TERM UNTIL DNA EVIDENCE FREES HIM; SLAYING: POLICE 
CALLED STEVEN LINSCOTT'S ACCOUNT A CONFESSION, NOT A VISION. NOW, 12 YEARS 
LATER, HE EXAMINES LESSONS PAINFULLY LEARNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHEN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourteen years ago, Steven Linscott told police a shocking story: He saw a man 
attack and kill someone. His account of the crime had one very unusual aspect 
-- he said it was just a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 A dream, though, that occurred the same night a neighbor was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Some details he recounted were similar to the woman's death; others were not. 
The discrepancies didn't dissuade police. To them, this was no vision, no 
coincidence -- this was a confession. 
</P>
<P>
 So began a long, bizarre odyssey that sounds like a Kafka tale: A Bible 
student and young father whose dream of a crime turns into a 12-year nightmare 
as he repeatedly proclaims his innocence -- from the police station to court to 
prison -- until new DNA tests finally free him. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years have passed since charges were dropped against Steve Linscott. Now, 
as he rebuilds his life, he has begun talking openly for the first time, 
promoting a book that examines lessons painfully learned. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be careful where you place your faith," said Linscott, now a 
40-year-old family therapist and the father of four. "We had a naive trust in 
the legal system. That was definitely a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to force the system to do its job," he added. "You need to kick it 
in the rear end. Even then, innocent people get harmed." 
</P>
<P>
 The state never declared him innocent. When abandoning its case, it said 
scientific evidence raised sufficient doubts about retrying Linscott, who 
served 3 1/2 years in prison before his guilty verdict was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 Linscott isn't surprised. "When this crowd drops a case, that's better than a 
jury decision that says you're not guilty . . .," he said. "That's the best 
exoneration possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Linscott said he hopes his book, "Maximum Security," co-authored by journalist 
Randall Frame and published by Crossway Books, will help other victims through 
their ordeals. "There are injustices all the time. . . . We've learned a lot 
about that." It's available mostly in Christian bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mild-mannered man with a penchant for religious parables and homespun 
phrases -- in talking about prison violence, for example, he says one inmate 
"beat the tar" out of another -- is not at ease playing the promotion game. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked that the central Illinois town where he lives remain secret. And 
though he has conducted numerous interviews, he also rejected an appearance on 
a big-time TV talk show -- one that would likely mean big book sales -- because 
it wanted to explore the psychic angle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to rush out and say this power exists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1980, police came to the door of the Christian halfway house where 
Linscott and his wife, Lois, had just begun working as house parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Ann Phillips, 24, a nurse's aide, had been raped and bludgeoned to death 
down the block in Oak Park, on the edge of Chicago's West Side, a high-crime 
area. Had the Linscotts heard or seen anything? 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Linscott, then a Bible college student, said he was reluctant to 
reveal his dream. But he did after mentioning it to his wife and a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he says he couldn't determine whether a man or woman was killed in his 
dream, he identified the victim as female in a written account police requested 
after they told him of Phillips' murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, he describes that dream: A blond man, about 5-foot-5 to 5-foot-7 
-- Linscott stands over 6 feet -- is talking to a second person. At first, he 
is calm. Then his demeanor changes, he takes out an object and begins striking 
the victim, until blood is flying everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't an unusual dream under the circumstances," Linscott said, noting 
that he was tense living with former inmates in a halfway house in a new 
neighborhood plagued by drugs, prostitution and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed that God maybe would use it (the dream) in some way," he said. "I 
did not ever suspect that it would be used by the cops against me. . . . If I 
have a sin, it was being naive." 
</P>
<P>
 Though there were some similarities between the dream and the crime, Linscott 
says there were dozens of differences, including a notable one: He thought the 
victim was black. Phillips was white. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities later said the discrepancies were his way of distancing himself 
from the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Linscott said he had never been in trouble before; his most serious brush with 
crime was a $50 speeding ticket in his native Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 He said police repeatedly assured him he was not a suspect. But they took 
blood, saliva and hair samples. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Linscott soon found his words used against him. He was convicted, 
sentenced to 40 years in prison and given what inmates jokingly call a Buck 
Rogers release date: 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 Linscott was transferred to the Centralia Correctional Center in southern 
Illinois; Lois moved down there so they could visit weekly. She worked as a 
nurse and found herself a single mother of three. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the longest time when the kids were little, I would tell them the police 
made a big mistake . . . and they thought Daddy did something to hurt someone," 
she said. "I tried not to ever make it sound like the police were bad people." 
</P>
<P>
 Those first months of separation were trying. His wife struggled with her new 
responsibilities; Linscott bristled with his new confinement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bitterness was tearing me apart," he said. "I realized I can't keep going 
on like this or I'm going to go in a black fugue. I'm not going to be able to 
handle life at all. I decided that as much as I hate it, I'm going to have to 
forgive these people (the authorities). . . . Once I did, life got much 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 So did his luck. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the Illinois Appellate Court overturned his guilty verdict, paving 
the way for his release on bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were adjustments when he left prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly makes you paranoid," he said. "You learn you can't trust 
anybody. You have to be on guard all the time. . . . When I came out, I 
basically kept everybody at arm's length." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our struggles," his wife said. "I thought he should be closer to God 
when he got out because I thought God had gotten us through this." 
</P>
<P>
 There was tension, too, not knowing how long he would remain free. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a series of appeals, prosecutors were criticized for misrepresenting 
key physical evidence against Linscott by suggesting it was conclusive when, in 
fact, it only showed he could not be eliminated as a suspect.

 One appellate judge wrote that in the Linscott case, "the American ideals of 
fairness were not just ignored, they were trampled upon." 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest break came as the state, in preparing for a second trial in 1992, 
decided to use new, more sophisticated DNA techniques to determine if old semen 
samples could be linked to Linscott. 
</P>
<P>
 The results eliminated Linscott as the attacker if he acted alone. His 
attorney notes there has never been any suggestion of multiple assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 Linscott says he still dreams, but never talks to anyone about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still wake up and am shocked by the realization that it's really over," he 
said. "It's taken at least two years to get some semblance of normalcy back 
into my life. . . . I just take stock every once in a while and think, 'Boy, 
the tension just keeps seeping away and I feel great.' "

TOWN MAY BE SINGLE-PARENT CAPITAL OF U.S.; MICHIGAN: BENTON HARBOR LEADS THE 
WAY TO UNCERTAIN ERA OF DIVORCE, EARLY WIDOWHOOD, OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS.

<P>
 When she got pregnant the first time, at age 15, Rashonda Jackson never 
considered marriage. Nor did she give much thought to abortion or adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 There was never really any doubt about what she would do. With her parents' 
blessing and that of her church, Rashonda had a baby boy, Shannon. It was 
enough to gain her entry into the least exclusive club in Benton Harbor: 
</P>
<P>
 Single motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the single-parent capital of the United States, a struggling 
Rust Belt town where an astonishing eight of every 10 families are headed by a 
single parent. The vast majority are single mothers, often in their teens or 
early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 Look around: The first thing you notice are the children, hordes of them on 
every street, riding bicycles, dribbling basketballs, running, shouting, just 
being kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mothers are often with them. Their fathers, almost never. Fathers, real, 
live-in fathers, are as scarce as good jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just not enough men, I guess," sighed one woman, Joyce White, who is 
rearing three teen-agers alone. "Well," she said on second thought, "there's 
enough men, but they just don't accept responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Men disagree, of course -- what they lack, they say, is work. Either way, 
Benton Harbor is helping lead the nation into an uncertain era in which 
divorce, early widowhood and out-of-wedlock births chip away at the nuclear 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Census Bureau recently reported a huge increase in the number of American 
children living with single parents. Nationwide, one of every four children 
live with only one parent; in more than one-third of those families, the parent 
has never been married. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the Associated Press, the Census Bureau conducted a closer, 
city-by-city analysis of the roughly 3,000 largest cities in the country -- all 
those with more than 4,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ranking of the cities by percentage of single-parent families, Benton 
Harbor stood at the top of the list. Eighty-three percent of its families with 
children were headed by a single parent. 
</P>
<P>
 (Actually, two retirement communities -- Sun City, Ariz., and Holiday City, 
N.J. -- ranked higher, but only because of a statistical quirk. Each had fewer 
than 10 families with children, and all the families were headed by single 
parents.) 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit; Camden, N.J.; and Tuskegee, Ala., were among other cities in which a 
majority of families were headed by single parents. 
</P>
<P>
 All these cities share certain characteristics: poverty, unemployment, drug 
use, lots of people on welfare. They also have large black populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Single parenthood is actually growing faster among whites, making this one 
area of American life that is on the road to racial parity. But nationwide, 
black children are still more than twice as likely as white children to be 
living with only one parent. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, Daniel Patrick Moynihan -- then an assistant secretary of labor, now 
a U.S. senator from New York -- warned the nation of the consequences of what 
he viewed as an alarming rate of out-of-wedlock births among black Americans. 
At the time, the rate was 25%. By the 1990s, the out-of-wedlock birthrate for 
all Americans had surpassed that; among blacks, it was approaching 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton Harbor is 92% black, a town of 12,800 on the shores of Lake Michigan, a 
straight shot across the water from Chicago. It is also straight across the St. 
Joseph River from the town of St. Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joe and Benton Harbor are often referred to as twin cities -- if so, they 
are fraternal, not identical, twins. St. Joseph is 95% white, and as 
middle-class as Benton Harbor is poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they comprise the nucleus of a metropolitan area that is among the 
most typical, statistically and socially, in the United States, according to 
American Demographics magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Benton Harbor is typical of anything, it is of an inner-city slum. By 
its appearances, it could be the poorest neighborhood in a mid-size city. Since 
it isn't -- since it's an entire city unto itself -- it is something of a 
statistical aberration. There are undoubtedly just as many single parents per 
capita in parts of New York or Chicago, but those neighborhoods are balanced by 
other, more affluent, socially stable districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most communities, you have your wealthy, your middle class and your lower 
income," observed Bill Wolf, a former mayor of Benton Harbor. "Unfortunately, 
Benton Harbor is almost unique in its homogeneity. It's 80% the same -- door to 
door to door, you'll find people who are on some kind of welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Driving through Benton Harbor, it is easy to see what a pleasant, thriving 
community it once was. There are big old wood-frame houses with wraparound 
porches, neat little parks and tree-lined streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But on some blocks, more houses are boarded up than not. Many are just gone, 
razed because they had decayed to the point of being hazards. Often as not, the 
houses that are in good repair are also surrounded by chain-link fences. 
</P>
<P>
 The downtown business district has an eerie, swept-clean feeling, as if 
evacuated in the face of some natural disaster. The most vibrant signs of life 
downtown are the flowers blooming in the vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
 And Benton Harbor has bounced back, to some extent. Almost everyone says it 
was worse a few years ago, back when Money magazine named it the worst place to 
live in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest employer is the Whirlpool Corp., which once made washing machines 
here. There also once were foundries, and auto parts suppliers that served the 
mighty factories in Detroit. There were department stores and family 
restaurants downtown, and proud homes and overflowing churches in the 
surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Whirlpool is still headquartered in Benton Harbor, but its washing machines 
are made elsewhere. What's left are mostly white-collar jobs for which few 
people in Benton Harbor are qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundries went; so did most of the auto suppliers; so did the department 
stores; so did the restaurants. The churches are still here, but they've lost a 
lot of their members. And some people say they've lost their spiritual path as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a town that's been brought to its knees. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is quite sure when the families began to dissolve, but the rise in 
single parenthood has mirrored the decline in the economy. Most people put a 
lot of blame on the welfare system, which penalizes recipients who marry. That, 
and widespread joblessness, made a mockery of the notion of a family 
breadwinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Attitudes changed too. The sexual revolution of the 1960s, coupled with the 
increased independence of women, removed the stigma of "illegitimacy" and gave 
women the confidence to strike out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 People in Benton Harbor talk a lot about the changes. Few think they were, on 
balance, for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no shame anymore," said Audrey Hale, the director of Project 
Together, a program that tries to pull women out of welfare. "It used to be a 
shame to have children out of wedlock. That's not true anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be more responsibility in a lot of black homes," said Tony 
Mitchell, a Benton Harbor native who runs an anti-poverty agency, Communities 
First. "We have a generation of parents and grandparents who have lost control. 
We have a generation of churches and ministers that have lost their 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's agency surveyed Benton Harbor residents to find out how they ranked 
the town's biggest problems. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1: Children having children. 
</P>
<P>
 What is striking about talking to single parents here is the extent to which 
marriage and children have become separated. It's not just that marriage 
doesn't always precede children; it's almost as if there's no link between the 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of single mothers sit around a conference table at Project Together on 
Main Street. This program, begun here six years ago, hires former welfare 
mothers to serve as mentors for women who feel trapped in the welfare cycle. If 
there's a theme in the conversation of these women, it's that the men in their 
lives have let them down. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these males out here, they don't want to work. They're just out for 
the easy money, the fast money," says Cornelia Davenport, a wide-eyed, 
broad-faced mother of two. Her son, Fredrick, draws figures on the 
conference-room blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids, I love them. . . . They see their father from time to time. I don't 
care if he helps out or not." 
</P>
<P>
 There's only one thing she expects from him, Davenport says. She wants him to 
be a positive role model for his children. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he? 
</P>
<P>
 "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Another mother, Sharon Chandler, speaks. She is an intense young woman with 
two nose rings, an easy laugh and a steel will. Her former boyfriend hit her on 
three occasions, she says; all three times, she went to jail for fighting back 
-- with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 She had two children by two fathers before she was 20, and describes Benton 
Harbor High School as "Maternity High" during her years there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to tell you all what I think it all boils down to," Chandler says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go ahead, girl," someone says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why milk the cow when you can get the milk for free?" 
</P>
<P>
 That could be taken several ways. Chandler explains she is referring to men 
who bed down with women who demand nothing in return. 
</P>
<P>
 As for herself, she has demanded child support from the father of her youngest 
child. She says he is in prison for failure to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad he's doing time," she adds. "I'm not sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 About a mile away from Project Together's bright, spacious office, men cluster 
on a cement walkway leading into a low-slung brick housing project. One, a 
retired machinist who gives his name as Ken Parnell, glares with unsuppressed 
rage when asked why there are so many single parents in Benton Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because black men can't get no jobs," he says, almost spitting the words. 
"Because white men got all the jobs sewed up. Because black women get on 
welfare and run the men out of the house. . . . How can you take care of your 
family if you can't get a job? That's it in a nutshell." 
</P>
<P>
 Parnell is a big man, still muscular at age 53, a man who says he worked two 
jobs to rear a family of eight. He has lived in Benton Harbor since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was down when I got here; it's gone down even more. Young brothers killing 
each other, shoot you if you look at them wrong. And it's kind of sad but it's 
understandable. They don't see nothin' to look forward to. Young (men) don't 
even smile. Sell some dope, dodge some bullets, that's what it's all about. 
Young tykes don't even have nothin' to look forward to." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, he gets in his son's car and drives away. Mad. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Jackson, a 41-year-old bus driver, knows what her mother would have 
said if she had become pregnant out of wedlock in her teens. "I know she would 
have told me to get married," Jackson says. 
</P>
<P>
 When her daughter, Rashonda, became pregnant in her teens, Jackson didn't tell 
her to get married. She decided to support whatever decision her daughter made 
and trust her instincts. Rashonda, she says, was always a responsible girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Jackson and her husband help care for their two grandsons. "They really 
think my father is their father instead of their grandfather," Rashonda says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rashonda is lithe, bright-eyed, with little whorls of hair plastered like 
appliques to her scalp. At first, she admits, she was overwhelmed by 
motherhood. But five years into it, she is beginning to exude the quiet 
confidence bestowed by maturity. She doesn't feel too young to be a mother. And 
she has goals: college, a good job, a better life for her kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Rashonda is asked if she might marry. Someday, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just not ready right now," she adds with a little giggle. It seems left 
over from the adolescence she so quickly lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just not old enough," she says.

TINIEST AMERICAN LIBRARY GOES OVER BIG IN APPALACHIA; TENNESSEE: THE 
5-BY-6-BY-6-FOOT WHITE STRUCTURE HOUSES 2,000 VOLUMES, MOSTLY LOVE STORIES, 
MYSTERIES, HISTORIES AND ENCYCLOPEDIAS.

 What's known as America's Smallest Library sits among the flowers in Dot 
Byrd's front yard. An American flag waves in a gentle breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-by-6-by-6-foot white clapboard structure is hardly big enough to turn 
around in and has a slightly musty smell. But it houses a ceiling-to-floor 
collection of 2,000 volumes, mostly paperback mysteries, histories, love 
stories and encyclopedias. 
</P>
<P>
 For 38 years it has been a beacon of literacy among the farms, coal mines and 
modest homes along winding, barely two-lane Back Valley Road in this stretch of 
Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
 It's soon to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we would have done without it," said May McGlothin, the 
86-year-old former Tennessee Teacher of the Year who paid $250 out of her own 
pocket for the lumber to build the library. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just the children, parents and grandparents of this hamlet of 1,500 
people who have come here. Visitors from all over stop by. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd, who retires next month when a much larger, community-built and 
computer-equipped library opens in nearby Coalfield, is at a loss to explain 
the interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea," said Byrd, 69. "Like I told Johnny Carson. I thought he 
wasted his time having me come to California to tell him about the little 
library." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the celebrity of America's Smallest Library carried Byrd to Hollywood for 
a 1989 appearance on "The Tonight Show," prompted by a story in the National 
Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 The $200 she earned talking to Carson began a building fund for the new 
library. Donations, free prison labor and community auctions have raised all 
but about $10,000 of the $55,000 needed for the new building. 
</P>
<P>
 Four decades ago, the community's small reading allotment arrived by 
bookmobile from the Clinch-Powell Regional Library about 20 miles away. The box 
of books was rotated among people's houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd, a nurse, began collecting the books in 1955. She wrapped them in oilskin 
to protect them from the rain since she and her husband, Perry, and their three 
children were living in a leaky one-room house. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlothin bought the lumber anonymously and had it delivered. The sawmill cut 
the boards too short, so Byrd found out who bought the wood. Nonetheless, the 
library was built. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perry and our kids and May and whoever else happened to come by picked up a 
hammer and went to workin' on it," Byrd said. "And we opened on Aug. 1, 1956." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan County at first refused to pay to operate it "because we didn't go 
through the proper channels to get it approved." 
</P>
<P>
 "We just built it and told them it was here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials soon relented and put Byrd on salary -- $5 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, Byrd's hours are 1 to 5 p.m. every Tuesday. But the door, like 
every other one in Back Valley, is never locked. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a small community like this, a library was just unheard of," said Jim 
Rivers, who grew up in Back Valley and leads the new library drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sets an ideal, you know," said Oliver Springs Elementary School principal 
Richard Davis, who remembers going to the library as a boy with his family. 
"The fact that you supported books and a library was passing a message to the 
kids that those things are important." 
</P>
<P>
 But time marches on. "I think the little library has kind of outlived its 
usefulness as far as today's society goes, which is kind of sad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd doesn't disagree, but she isn't going to part with the old library 
entirely. The books will go to the new library, and her grandson and others 
will refurbish the old one to hold books filling her house that were 
specifically donated to Back Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new library opens, Byrd said, she will probably feel let down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perry swears I will just sit and cry. And I wouldn't be a bit surprised," she 
said. But she added that she can't wait "to just check out books as a patron."

BRING-BACK-THE-BISON IDEA NO WASHOUT; GREAT PLAINS: PROPOSAL TO SUPPLANT PEOPLE 
WITH BUFFALO GAINS STANDING AS GHOST TOWNS MULTIPLY ACROSS PRAIRIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE FEINSILBER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven years ago, Frank and Deborah Popper, two academics from the East, tore 
up heartland America with a startling notion: The Great Plains would -- and 
maybe should -- be almost emptied of people and returned to the buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Poppers are back, with a new research paper that says that much of 
what they predicted is already happening, though not as severely as they first 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The outrage was palpable when they made their forecast. People accused them of 
plotting urban renewal in small-town America. 
</P>
<P>
 From Abilene to Dodge City, this husband-and-wife team's prediction of the 
formation of a "Buffalo Common" rangeland ran into ridicule and denunciation, 
even a death threat. But it spurred a lot of thinking about the future of the 
prairie states. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, claim the Poppers, the landscape -- "nearly treeless, semiarid, 
austerely beautiful, historically untenable" -- is returning to its natural 
state in vast swaths. 
</P>
<P>
 But people are finding new ways to cope and to stay -- a tendency the Poppers 
did not fully recognize in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a decline scenario," said Frank Popper, who teaches urban studies at 
Rutgers University in New Jersey. His wife teaches geography at the College of 
Staten Island, a branch of City University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 They had predicted it would take 20 to 30 years for vegetation and wildlife to 
reassert themselves and restore the Plains to their "pre-white conditions" 
outside of a handful of population centers. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence that it's starting to happen, the Poppers cite statistics: 
hundreds of ghost towns in Kansas; 5,000 to 10,000 deserted farmhouses in 
Nebraska; population drop-offs in 38 of the 41 counties of North Dakota, 22 of 
the 23 counties in Oklahoma, 50 of the 52 Plains counties in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people especially are dwindling in numbers. Tim Borich, a rural 
sociologist, says there are more people in Iowa over age 75 than under 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a generation," the Poppers still say, "large parts of the rural Plains 
will be far emptier, more frontier-like than today." 
</P>
<P>
 But now they say those who remain often will find livelihoods as custodians, 
rather than only as users, of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 They still foresee a role for the bison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ranchers can easily switch to buffalo and selling hunting rights, meats, 
hides, horns and skulls and health prices," they say. "Bison are less laborious 
to tend than cattle, better able to withstand Plains winters and easier on the 
land. Buffalo meat has more protein and less fat and cholesterol than beef." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of buffalo exceed 12,500 a year; one consortium of Indian tribes 
foresees sales of 20,000 for itself. Canadians, too, eye the buffalo as a 
resource. 
</P>
<P>
 But prairie people, well-educated, self-sustaining, highly motivated, aren't 
especially eager to turn in their plows so they can pump gasoline for tourists 
or serve them breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.) rejects the Popper scenario. He sees the 
agricultural economy saving itself by turning toward end-use ventures. The 
Poppers, he said, "took an element of truth and magnified it and created a 
distorted picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle cites a home-state enterprise he visited that mixes soybean meal with 
recycled plastic milk cartons to create a product tougher than wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to be more than just a raw agricultural product exporter," Daschle 
said. "We've got to add value." 
</P>
<P>
 He sees the information revolution as helping. When he grew up, people shared 
a party-line phone with as many as 10 families. On a recent stay, he rented a 
rural motel room and made international calls and sent and received faxes. "I 
could have been in Washington or London," he said.

 In a land where the problem for centuries has been getting enough to eat, not 
too much, children of the new capitalists have grown so obese they have their 
own fat farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Liu Mingjie, 14 years old and 209 pounds, stood out even there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look at me! I'm too fat!" she complained after straining through 24 
sit-ups at the Beijing Tian Yu Weight-Loss Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 All sorts of special diets had done nothing for Liu. But at the camp, she lost 
more than 6 1/2 pounds in just six days. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other 60 campers, age 7 to 16, did even better. The star by Day 7 
of the standard 10-day regimen was Wang Yuewei, a 16-year-old who dropped 26 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "His potbelly has disappeared!" Wang's delighted mother shouted on parents' 
visiting day. She raced through the halls, looking for a telephone to call home 
with the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 Food occupies an exalted place in Chinese culture, perhaps because it has been 
so difficult for most people to come by. But obesity is a relatively new 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the new rich produced by capitalism and double-digit economic growth 
indulge not only in traditional delicacies, but in such fatty Western novelties 
as hamburgers, french fries and premium ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese have always liked to express their wealth through food, 
especially in feeding their children," said Zhang Shuyu, a physician who 
founded and runs the Tian Yu camp. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, children are spoiled all the more because of the government policy 
that allows only one per family, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang started the camp in 1990 on the grounds of a hospital in Xiao Tangshan, 
a village surrounded by cornfields an hour's drive north of Beijing. Her 
weight-loss program combines Western nutritional theory, Chinese traditional 
medicine and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the 10-day camp costs the equivalent of more than $80, about twice the 
average monthly wage, it initially attracted only the children of Beijing 
professionals. But when word of Zhang's success got around, rich peasants and 
entrepreneurs began sending children from as far away as south China. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first three days, campers are put on a liquid diet to shrink their 
stomachs, reduce fat and regulate metabolism. For the next seven, they eat a 
no-sweets, low-starch diet high in protein, nutrients and vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
 Campers spend four to five hours a day running, jumping rope, swimming, doing 
calisthenics and lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
 On visiting day, the lectures were for the parents. Zhang handed out suggested 
menus, advised them not to spoil their children and urged them to stay in touch 
with the camp staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't undo what we've done here," she said.

 Three fire trucks rushed to the White House early Friday afternoon because of 
a report that someone smelled smoke but aides said there was no fire, just a 
short-circuit in a light fixture. 
</P>
<P>
 "A light fixture shorted out and there was a strong odor," White House press 
secretary Dee Dee Myers said. "Nothing has burned at all."

YOU COULD GET EXERCISED OVER WEE SUB; INVENTIONS: AFTER THREE DECADES BUILDING 
ONE-PERSON AND TWO-PERSON CRAFTS, FORMER NAVY CAPTAIN IS WORKING TO PERFECT A 
HUMAN-POWERED VERSION. 
</P>

<P>
 George Kittredge built his first miniature submarine because he wanted to see 
the bottom of the ocean. Now he is developing what could be the "ultimate 
exercise machine." 
</P>
<P>
 After three decades of building one-person and two-person subs that are 
powered by electrical batteries, the 76-year-old former Navy captain is working 
to perfect a human-powered craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Kittredge admits that more than one of his neighbors in the small coastal 
community where he lives halfway between Portland and Bar Harbor have asked why 
he would want to build a submarine that is pedaled like a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I (tell them) this is going to be the ultimate exercise machine," he said 
with a laugh. "You get in, pedal yourself down to 250 feet, rest a bit, and 
then if you have the strength you pedal yourself back up." 
</P>
<P>
 In the event the operator is too tired to pedal back to the surface, the 
submarine -- which looks a bit like a fuel tank -- has four redundant safety 
systems that allow the craft to rise on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Kittredge has built 41 battery-powered miniature submarines since he retired 
from the Navy in the 1960s. He said the decision to build the first one was 
prompted by something he could not do in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're in a military submarine you can look through the periscope but 
you can never see the bottom," he said. "I decided that I wanted to see the 
bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Kittredge's submarines provide plenty of opportunities for looking around 
while under the waves. There are four portholes at eye level, and a larger 
viewing window on the floor near the operator's feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The operator controls the craft with handles connected to its rudders and 
ballast tanks. "Simplicity is the key to underwater work. You don't want it to 
get complicated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kittredge's new sub follows the same basic design as his battery-powered craft 
-- a design, he proudly notes, that has been certified by marine engineering 
societies in the United States, Britain and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 It was partly out of frustration that it took up to eight hours to charge the 
batteries in his conventional submarines that got Kittredge thinking about 
using human power. 
</P>
<P>
 Kittredge calculates that someone in good physical shape should be able to 
generate a half horsepower. "That ought to be able to move a vehicle along," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kittredge admitted, however, there was a hitch during his first tests of the 
human-powered sub. He accidentally placed the gears in backward, an error that 
caused the propeller to rotate at a slower rate than the pedals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had it in the water twice; it just didn't move very fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kittredge ended up rowing the sub back to shore, he said he still has 
"the greatest confidence" he will soon get it working the way he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Kittredge has more time these days to work on the craft. He has signed a 
licensing agreement with a Japanese company that allows the firm to produce his 
battery-powered submarines. 
</P>
<P>
 The human-powered design may not be Kittredge's last innovation of submarine 
technology. He is also developing a new underwater salvage business, although 
he is reluctant to talk about future plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that old men should tell what they intend to do in the future. 
It really bores people and people don't believe it," he said.

HIGH-TECH LOBBYING DIALS WRONG NUMBER; WASHINGTON: SPECIAL INTERESTS CAN MAKE 
IT APPEAR THAT THEIR POINT OF VIEW IS COMING FROM ORDINARY FOLKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Steve Raby, Sen. Howell Heflin's top aide, was surprised when a letter signed 
with his own name arrived in the office strongly objecting to President 
Clinton's health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter -- and a nearly identical one a week later -- was generated by the 
Health Care Leadership Council, a business coalition that aired radio spots 
urging listeners to call a toll-free number to be put in touch with their 
members of Congress on health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Raby had called the number, but had not given permission for any letter to be 
sent to his boss, an Alabama Democrat. "I said, 'I disagree with your message,' 
" he recalled telling the operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Bonner, whose lobbying firm ran the campaign for the council, said such 
incidents are rare. "You're going to have a few mistakes happen. It's not 
intentional, and it's against all written and oral policies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the episode raises questions about the dangers inherent in high-tech 
lobbying and its opportunities for abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way for special interests to appear to be coming from the 
grass-roots," said Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), who said his office has also 
received technology-generated mail misrepresenting constituents' feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 The discrepancy was discovered when his office wrote back to North Dakotans 
acknowledging their letters. "We've had letters back from people unaware of the 
fact that something has been sent in their name, and saying, 'In fact, I don't 
feel that way,' " Dorgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 One danger, said Dorgan, is that the advertising or phone call that prompts 
people to contact their lawmakers may not fully disclose who is paying for the 
lobbying effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person probably has no idea, (for example,) that they're calling on 
behalf of a pharmaceutical manufacturer," he said. "The economic interest is 
not disclosed. It could be a way for a big pharmaceutical company to use a 
low-income senior citizen to do (its) bidding in an unwitting way." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner disagrees, saying his services only facilitate democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democracy, lawmaking, politicking is never a clear-cut, clean, pristine 
process," he said. "But it is infinitely better that any group that has a 
legislative interest . . . take their message outside the Beltway to the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 His job, Bonner said, is to make it easier for those who agree with his 
clients to communicate their support to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who answer the phones at the Capitol say many callers know little more 
than what they have just seen or heard in a television or radio spot, words 
chosen less to educate than to fan the flames of fear or anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to flesh out some reasons so we can tell the congressman, to know 
what people are thinking," said Trish Riley, an aide to Rep. Tim Holden 
(D-Pa.). But when asked why they hold their opinions the callers often say, ' 
"I'm not sure. I just don't want you to vote for it,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are real confused. They don't want to leave their name and number. 
They just want to get off the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorgan told of one caller to his office who began the conversation, "Do you 
know what I'm supposed to tell you? It has something to do with voting." The 
North Dakota small businessman then added, "Something to do with the health 
plan, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he wanted to voice an opinion on health care to Dorgan, the man 
replied, "Not really. I don't know how I feel yet. I told that lady that when 
she called, but she said she was going to transfer me anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 The practice of selectively putting through only the callers who agree with 
the lobbying client angered at least one lawmaker, Rep. Ike Skelton (D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to call and give me their honest-to-goodness thoughts," Skelton 
said. "These people are blocking out some and letting others go through." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner said it would be absurd for a lobbying group to pay to deliver their 
opponents' views. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know of no 800 line used for an advocacy purpose where people are put 
through on the other side" of the issue, he said.

GRAVE TELLS OF UNION SOLDIER'S FINAL HOUR; ARCHEOLOGY: BONES, ARTIFACTS TAKEN 
FROM ANTIETAM HELP SCIENTISTS GET A SENSE OF ONE UNION FIGHTER, A CASUALTY OF 
THE CONFLICT'S BLOODIEST BATTLE.

<P>
 In a moment of peace before the battle, the Union soldier must have looped his 
rosary around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Then three .58-caliber rounds pierced his chest, shattering his breastbone, 
and the New York Irishman fell to the ground, one of the 23,110 casualties of 
the Battle of Antietam. 
</P>
<P>
 His grave and those of three comrades were unearthed in 1988 -- 126 years 
after the bloodiest day in U.S. military history -- by Civil War buffs who had 
been looking for relics on private land within the battlefield boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last six years, archeologists and anthropologists have analyzed the 
four soldiers' bones, dozens of artifacts and historical records to produce a 
rare glimpse into the last 45 minutes of one soldier's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much is told from the perspective of the generals and officers," said 
Stephen R. Potter, an archeologist with the National Park Service. "This 
personalizes the bloodiest day of American military history in the eyes of one 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on artifacts found in the graves, Potter determined that all were 
members of the 63rd New York Regiment, part of the famous Irish Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification process was narrowed further when an analysis of the bones 
showed that one of the men was 40 or older. (Most Civil War soldiers were in 
their late teens and 20s.) The other three were under 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter has deduced that the middle-aged soldier was either Pvt. James 
Gallagher, a stonecutter from Kilkenny, Ireland; Pvt. Martin McMahon, a laborer 
born in County Clare, Ireland; or Pvt. James McGarigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter believes that the private, whoever he was, probably took off his cap 
and placed the rosary about his neck after the brigade chaplain, Father William 
Corby, rode by shouting conditional absolution to those who were about to die. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Irish Brigade approached what would later be named Bloody Lane, a 
sunken road in the middle of the battlefield, a column of Confederates moved 
onto the crest of the plateau. The Irish Brigade had already suffered heavy 
losses, but continued to drive back the Confederates. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Irish Brigade reached the crest, the Confederates rose up and fired 
into the front rank. Potter believes that it was probably in this volley that 
the middle-aged Irishman was struck down. 
</P>
<P>
 According to historical accounts of the battle, at least eight color bearers 
of the Irish Brigade hit the ground, wounded or dead, after the first volley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certain he was a member of the color guard," Potter said. "If you are a 
member of the color guard, you are likely to be a target. He was no fool. He 
knew -- to borrow a Southern phrase -- he didn't stand a dog's chance in hell." 
</P>
<P>
 The men died the day of the battle -- Sept. 17, 1862 -- and were hastily 
buried under 20 inches of earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers rested there until 1988, when George Rees of Medina, Ohio, and 
two friends swept a field with metal detectors. Rees started digging and found 
a brass hook from a soldier's pack, then ammunition, then buttons, and finally 
a tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 They took their findings to the landowner and later notified the National Park 
Service after they became uncomfortable about having disturbed a burial site. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic scientists have had few opportunities to examine remains from Civil 
War burial sites, where the dead are usually allowed to rest in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 But these graves yielded 13 to 15 fragmented bones for each of the four men -- 
compared with a total of 206 bones in a human skeleton -- enough for Douglas 
Owsley, forensic anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution's National 
Museum of Natural History. He examined fingers, teeth, fragments of skull, 
shoulders, feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in 1988, the remains were reburied in a plain pine coffin at the 
National Cemetery at Antietam after a Mass at Bloody Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter said the research showed that a handful of bones and artifacts can shed 
important light on the past -- and the life of one Civil War victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't live to tell his story," Potter said. "I guess I felt it was my 
responsibility to tell his story."

HEALTH CARE CAREERS BECKON TEEN-AGERS; WEST VIRGINIA: UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS HOPE 
THEY CAN KEEP PREDOMINANTLY BLACK AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN 
INTERESTED IN PROFESSIONS.

 Tanai Alston peppered the doctor with questions like any good first-year 
medical student, wanting to know as much as he could about the chest X-ray 
showing an advanced state of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what that is?" Dr. Michael Elnicki asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cancer," Alston answered and fired off another question almost as quickly as 
Elnicki said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp, but at just 13, Alston and the other 46 students attending the weeklong 
Health Sciences and Technology Academy at West Virginia University have another 
seven years of school before applying to medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the university's Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center are hoping 
they can keep these and other predominantly black and economically 
disadvantaged children interested in pursuing an education that would 
eventually lead to health care professions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose is to spark their energy and their interest early toward careers 
that they may not otherwise think about," said project director Ann Chester. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the weeklong program is the hope that these students will one 
day earn a degree in nursing, pharmacy, dentistry or medicine and return home 
to areas in desperate need of health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the students that live in the areas that need the health care, that 
need the professionals worse than other areas," Chester said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What better way to get health care and technology into those areas than to 
pull the students from those areas, have them go through the career preparation 
processes and go back into the community and practice?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alston comes from McDowell County, which ranks among the worst in unemployment 
in a state that does the same nationally. He said the academy only strengthened 
his dream to become an anesthesiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to be a doctor when I grow up and I didn't really want to 
be around a lot of blood," he said. "All (anesthesiologists) do is shoot 
people, put them to sleep and make a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Elnicki, who specializes in internal medicine, called the program a "neat 
idea" as he prepared to show another small group of students X-rays, images of 
a person's brain and a device that lets them see their heart beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've actually had some very good questions," he said. "This last group 
wanted to know how long it took to go through medical school? How much does it 
cost? Is there some way you can get your education paid for?" 
</P>
<P>
 In another half-hour class, Eddie Leonard, 13, intently tried to find the 
pulse of Barrington North, 14. They were learning how to take a blood pressure 
reading as part of a lesson on nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is interesting," Leonard said. "I'm learning a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Chester said the academy will become part of another program for recent high 
school graduates interested in health care professions and a two-day program 
for younger students who show an interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Community and school programs, like health sciences clubs, will fill in the 
gaps, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we'd like to do is take it across the state, focusing on areas of 
highest need," Chester said. "We want to make sure students that are brought 
into the program stay in the program until they hit college." 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives you a chance to see opportunities in job careers which you would 
probably never get to see so up close, plus you get to see what it's like to go 
to a university," said LaRahn Davis, 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaries were a popular question among the children. Davis was particularly 
interested in how much Barbara Komives, director of the university's dental 
hygiene program, thought her students could make. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to be personal, but how is the pay?" he asked. "Good enough to 
have a (Mercedes) Benz in the garage?" 
</P>
<P>
 Komives assured him that a dental hygienist could draw a good salary and have 
a "Benz in the garage."

INSECT-BORNE FUNGUS TAKING ITS TOLL OF FAMOUS STANDS OF MONTEREY PINES; 
ECOLOGY: SCIENTISTS URGE CALIFORNIANS NOT TO PLANT THE TREE IN HOPES THAT A 
MORATORIUM WILL HELP LIMIT THE AFFLICTION. LITTLE ELSE CAN BE DONE ABOUT PITCH 
CANKER UNTIL RESEARCHERS DEVELOP A MORE RESISTANT PINE. 
</P>

<P>
 They first adorned California's coastline and now grace its man-made 
landscapes. Monterey pines, blessed with quick growth and evergreen beauty, are 
among the most popular of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists now urge people not to plant the Monterey pine in California. 
They hope a moratorium will help limit an insect-borne fungus that afflicts the 
trees -- and could threaten other valuable conifers. 
</P>
<P>
 Little more can be done about pitch canker fungus until researchers develop a 
more resistant strain of Monterey pine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's essentially not controllable at the moment," said Andrew Storer, an 
entomologist at the University of California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Storer and several other UC scientists have been studying the ailing trees, 
which are concentrated on or near the central coast, from Berkeley to the 
Monterey Peninsula. Smaller outbreaks range elsewhere along the coast, from 
Ukiah to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey pines become infected when beetles or other insects carrying pitch 
canker fungus burrow into the bark. The trees develop lesions that exude resin 
and start to die; needles fade, wilt and fall out. 
</P>
<P>
 The pines can die slowly from the fungus itself or from further infestation by 
insects taking advantage of the tree's weakened state. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease can affect many different pines throughout the world. It is 
believed to be native to Mexico and is seen in the southeastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But it hadn't been seen in Monterey pines anywhere until 1986. Since then, it 
has spread rapidly, with devastating results. 
</P>
<P>
 "In coastal Santa Cruz and Monterey counties it is affecting most of the 
trees, maybe 85%," Storer said. Monterey pines outside California apparently 
remain unaffected, and nurserymen say the disease is not a serious problem in 
the state's hot and dry inland areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monterey pine occurs naturally in three small stands on the central 
California coast, at Ano Nuevo Point, on the Monterey Peninsula and near San 
Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 But humans have made it the world's most widely planted pine, Storer said. Its 
rapid, straight growth up to 100 feet make it prized for timber as well as for 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, it is one of the most popular of all nursery trees, a common 
sight in landscaping, along freeways and on golf courses. It is the predominant 
Christmas tree grown in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those trees are ailing or at risk because there's no real way to 
control pitch canker, Storer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Controls against insects won't work -- there are too many insects that do 
this. And they're hard to get to because they hide under the bark," he said. 
"And again, the fungus is in the bark." 
</P>
<P>
 So Storer and other researchers recommend, in UC's California Agriculture 
magazine, that no more Monterey pines be planted in California for the time 
being. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists make an exception for Christmas tree farms, which depend 
heavily on Monterey pines. But they warn tree farmers in Southern California 
that they could lose a fifth of their crop this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas trees, including Monterey pines, were a $21.8-million business in 
the state in 1992, the last year for which figures are available, according to 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those trees are Monterey pines -- nearly 72% statewide in 1993 and 
99.7% in Southern California -- according to the California Christmas Tree 
Growers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Transportation once planted thousands of Monterey 
pines along the state's highways. But in the late 1980s it had to remove 
hundreds of infected trees and stopped planting the species, said Caltrans 
spokesman Jim Drago. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists also warn landscapers to be cautious about planting other kinds of 
conifers. They're concerned that pitch canker could spread to other species of 
pine and to the Douglas fir, an enormously important timber tree. 
</P>
<P>
 UC researchers are working on a guide for landscapers to help them decide 
which trees they can plant in which areas with minimal risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Storer and other UC plant and insect experts also want to develop a strain of 
Monterey pine resistant to the fungus. They're hoping to get results from the 
remaining native stands -- even though infection has spread to trees at Ano 
Nuevo and the Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given enough time, I think it probably can be done" Storer said. "But it's 
not something that's going to be available for a number of years."

 British Columbia police forces must be held to stricter public accountability 
to counter perceptions of bias and brutality, a two-year-long inquiry has 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Wallace Oppal, in his final report to the provincial government, 
said policing in British Columbia must be overhauled through independent public 
processes. 
</P>
<P>
 The province's NDP government, which is studying the 317 recommendations, 
launched Oppal's inquiry in June 1992 following a series of controversial 
police shootings.

LIGHTNING'S DEJA VU FOR MINNESOTA MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They say lightning never strikes the same spot twice. Tell that to Clifford 
Teigland. 
</P>
<P>
 Electricity coursed through Teigland's body for the second time in 14 years 
when lightning hit him as he inserted a key into the back door of his postal 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Teigland doesn't remember hearing or seeing anything. Witnesses said he was 
thrown 10 feet from the truck onto the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like something was pulling me into the vehicle," he said. "Then there 
was this guy standing over me telling me not to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Teigland, 35, spent two days in the hospital. The key chain holding the key 
for his truck was singed and melted. He doesn't know what happened to the keys. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen years ago, lightning struck Teigland's car while he was outside the 
vehicle. He didn't realize the car held the electrical charge, and was tossed 
to the ground when he grabbed the door handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just felt like sticking my fingers in a light socket," he said. "This 
one is like if you stuck your whole head in the socket."

RURAL HOSPITALS TURN TO INNOVATION TO SURVIVE AS HUNDREDS CLOSE DOORS; 
MEDICINE: THE REBIRTH OF MEDICAL CARE IN A RURAL NORTH CAROLINA AREA IS THE 
RESULT OF AN ALLIANCE OF HOSPITALS WITH WILL TO LIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 Worse than the pain, Darrell Mitchell recalls, was the fear of how badly he 
was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-foot fall from a cherry tree had shattered his left arm. Bone poked from 
his elbow. He was covered with blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was only when I made it to Burnsville that I knew I was going to be OK," 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burnsville" is the Yancey County Medical Center -- a primary care clinic born 
of a failed hospital, the former Burnsville Community. It's where Mitchell was 
bandaged and sedated before being rushed to Memorial Mission Medical Center, 35 
miles away in Asheville, where an orthopedic team set nine fractures in his 
hand and arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been bad if there was nothing in Burnsville," he said. "It 
didn't relieve the pain, but it relieved me to know I was in their care and 
everything was going to be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's path from orchard to operating suite provides a map for health care 
reform that is moved by economics and modest government programs rather than by 
the proposals for sweeping change that foundered in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebirth of medical care in Burnsville is the result of a health care 
alliance, similar to what President Clinton's original plan would have 
required. In this case it was formed willingly, by three hospitals seeking 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "These alliances and partnerships are developing in response to market 
forces," said Jim Bernstein, head of North Carolina's Office of Rural Health. 
"We have health reform under way without health reform legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 Burnsville also provides a glimpse of the kinds of missteps and excesses that 
contributed to the nation's health care crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of such misjudgments, this little town in the Blue Ridge foothills was 
virtually without medical care for 18 months after its 16-bed hospital closed, 
awash in years of red ink. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to the problem was the reluctance, typical in small towns, to sacrifice a 
struggling local hospital so another might grow stronger and thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a community is realistic and says this hospital isn't working and looks at 
alternatives, it's going to stand it in good stead. If it doesn't change, the 
community suffers," said John Supplitt, director of the American Hospital 
Assn.'s section for small or rural hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnsville's stubbornness might be hard for urbanites to understand. Only 20 
miles to the east is the 42-bed Spruce Pine Community Hospital; Asheville's 
Memorial Mission Hospital, a 418-bed regional medical center, is 45 minutes to 
the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambulance and helicopter can get a critically ill rural patient to help in the 
time it takes a city ambulance to fight through heavy traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fates of rural hospitals are always tangled in civic pride and 
economic hard choices. In small towns, hospitals are major employers. They help 
attract doctors as well as other new residents and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate we've built everything around the hospital being the focal 
point of health care," said Bernstein. "Communities pour money into the 
hospital and, when it can't survive anymore, you pull the rug out from under 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Many towns have suffered Burnsville's fate. The hospital association says 389 
rural hospitals closed from 1980 through 1992. The rate is accelerating: 
Two-thirds of those closings came after 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Many were built under the Hall-Burton Act, a federal effort to seed the 
heartland with hospitals after World War II. The program moved at such feverish 
speed that Sears, Roebuck & Co. sold prefabricated hospital kits. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the 1980s, demographics and rapid medical changes were making those 
hospitals obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger generations moved away from their rural roots, leaving behind 
lower-paying Medicare patients. Unable to afford costly CAT and MRI scanners, 
cardiac labs and state-of-the-art surgical suites, rural hospitals began losing 
patients to larger regional hospitals for even the most basic procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can cover 85% of what you go to the hospital for, but we're always 
fighting that notion that bigger is better," said Keith Holtsclaw, vice 
president of Spruce Pine Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Spruce Pine and Yancey County Hospital opened in the mid-1950s. By 1977, both 
needed renovation. At the urging of consultants and government officials, the 
two merged as the Blue Ridge Hospital System Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The new entity spent $3 million to renovate and expand. Yancey County Hospital 
became Burnsville Community Hospital, an acute-care facility with 16 beds, 
skilled nursing and a 24-hour emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 While that meant a shiny new facility for the citizens of Burnsville, it 
duplicated what was down the road in Spruce Pine. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came cuts in Medicare payments, which cover 70% of both hospitals' 
patient population. The two hospitals ran up a $4.2-million deficit. Burnsville 
lost $750,000 annually on its underused emergency room alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no favorable bottom line in keeping Burnsville," said Charles 
Aldridge, Spruce Pine president, who wrote checks to cover expenses, then 
tucked them into a desk drawer awaiting cash to cover them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were cannibalizing our assets to keep the operations working," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the losses, local politics created a tug of war: Blue Ridge board 
members were split between Yancey County, home to Burnsville, and Mitchell 
County, where Spruce Pine is located. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board members and public in both counties expected to be treated 
equally," Aldridge said. "We had two emergency rooms, two X-ray machines, two 
labs and other services. But we didn't have the funds to support them." 
</P>
<P>
 Spruce Pine faltered; Burnsville shut down. A hole gaped open in the region's 
health care net. 
</P>
<P>
 It was stitched closed by necessity and a fresh approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Yancey County bought Burnsville Hospital and converted it into a primary-care 
center -- an 8-to-5 center for sniffles, sprains and stitches. Asheville's 
Memorial Mission stepped in to manage the center, pay doctors and supervise 
ambulance services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asheville hospital loaned $300,000 to Spruce Pine, which now offers a 
second tier of care, including an emergency room, outpatient care, clinics and 
some surgery, at less cost than Asheville. 
</P>
<P>
 A new federal program for rural hospitals, now operating in seven states, 
helps by paying Spruce Pine and Burnsville slightly higher Medicare 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 While the arrangement benefits the two small communities, it is also a boon 
for Memorial Mission. Without Burnsville and Spruce Pine, the Asheville 
hospital would be swamped with primary care patients, requiring investments in 
personnel and space. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the arrangement funnels referrals to Memorial Mission's 
expensive specialty units. Before, cardiac patients might wind up in 
Winston-Salem, or Johnson City, Tenn. Now they go to Asheville. 
</P>
<P>
 There are ambitious plans for the future: a computerized record system sharing 
patient data with doctors at all three facilities, and talk of a network that 
will care for patients throughout their lives.

AT OTHER END OF TOLL-FREE TOURISM HOT LINES: JAIL BARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLMSTROM, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thinking of traveling to Iowa in the next few weeks? Maybe a visit to the 
National Balloon Museum or Herbert Hoover's birthplace? When you call the state 
tourist hot line at 1-800-345-IOWA for a map and a guidebook, listen carefully. 
That friendly male voice is coming to you from maximum security at the Iowa 
State Penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawkeye state, like a handful of other states including Arizona, Nebraska 
and New Jersey, is using prisoners on tourist hot lines to help promote tourism 
while cutting state expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Jersey, as many as 40 women inmates from the maximum security Edna 
Mahan Correctional Facility answer thousands of calls a day on the toll-free 
travel and tourism line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where we would be without them," said Greg Gilstrap, tourism 
director for Arizona, referring to the six women inmates in blue jeans and blue 
T-shirts who arrive each morning at the state tourism office in Phoenix. They 
answer local tourist calls and do office work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would probably utilize more inmates if we had more office space," said 
Gilstrap. At the end of the workday the inmates are returned to the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Using prison inmates for cheap labor is nothing new for states. "At the turn 
of the century, much of the barbed-wire industry came from Minnesota prisons, 
and Texas inmates were contracted out to cotton field owners," said Jerome 
Miller, head of the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives in 
Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon used prison inmates to answer tourism information lines over the last 
three years and then disconnected in January of this year, indicating some 
difficulties in the levels of enthusiasm from inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inmates weren't as responsive as we needed them to be," said Jim 
Cunningham of the Oregon Tourism Division, "so we contracted with a private 
company that now provides us with broader services, and is 100% better." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the U.S. Justice Department, about 20 states now employ inmates 
to do work such as make license plates, furniture, and clothes. "It's too soon 
to tell how far telemarketing will spread in prisons," said Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 In Iowa, a cellblock at the men's prison at Ft. Madison was remodeled and the 
cells were turned into telemarketing stations. "It's a good assignment for the 
inmates," said Nancy Landess, marketing manager for Iowa's Tourism Division in 
Des Moines. "They have always had jobs like making furniture, and now they can 
move into the service industry and work with computers." 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates in Iowa can earn between 32 and 72 cents an hour, which is better pay 
than most prison jobs offer. The inmates receive training in phone courtesy, 
tourism attractions throughout the state and how to operate computers. At the 
height of the tourist season, inmates handle up to 1,200 calls a day and send 
out packets of tourist information. 
</P>
<P>
 One inmate on the hot line, after answering a question about skiing in Iowa, 
said, "This works out pretty well for me. It's much better than lifting weights 
and being miserable all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 In Arizona, Gilstrap said it is "refreshing" to see how pleased the inmates 
are with their opportunity. "Given the fact that their alternative is cleaning 
up the prison grounds for about three cents an hour, they tend to be very 
appreciative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that there has been substantial savings for the state," 
said Ron Welder, correctional services manager for the Iowa State Penitentiary. 
"And the state department of transportation is thinking of using inmates to 
answer an 800 line for the most asked questions, (such as,) when is the license 
bureau open?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some problems," said Welder, "like inmates sending out additional 
information or trying to contact the person that called, and some inmates can't 
get used to answering phones. But the problems have been minor." 
</P>
<P>
 In Iowa the phone calls are monitored by supervisors who move around the phone 
stations listening to the conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually what led to the decline of using prisoners for outside labor," 
said Miller, "were abuses and strong opposition from unions."

MARVELS ABOUND DEEP WITHIN FOR CAVE EXPLORERS; MEXICO: TEAM DESCENDS TO 4,839 
FEET, THE DEEPEST THAT HUMANS HAVE GONE IN A CAVERN IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. 
ONE DIES IN THE ATTEMPT.

<P>
 I gazed at these marvels in profound silence. Words were utterly wanting to 
indicate the sensations of wonder I experienced. To give body and existence to 
such new sensations would have required the coinage of new words.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Jules Verne 
</P>
<P>
 "A Journey to the Centre of the Earth" 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred thirty years later, words still fail the explorers who venture 
into the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is pure exploration," said Bill Stone. "If you haven't been 
there, you can't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 For 44 days this spring, Stone and his teammates were underground in a natural 
abyss in southern Mexico, descending three-quarters of a mile vertically under 
the surface, then swimming through a half-mile-long underwater tunnel to an 
air-filled cavern. 
</P>
<P>
 They eventually got down to 4,839 feet -- just short of a mile -- the deepest 
humans have gone in a cave in the Western Hemisphere, the fifth deepest in the 
world. One member of the expedition died in the attempt. Why did they do it?  
</P>
<P>
 "It's unknown territory down there," Stone said. "It's basically the last 
bastion on this planet of truly manned geographical exploration. If you ask, 
'Who has been doing exploration in the last 30 years?' you can pretty much say 
it's been 12 Apollo astronauts who set foot on the moon and the cave explorers 
of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Not spelunkers. Not even cavers. Explorers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of myself as a modern-age explorer; that's what this is all about," 
Stone said. "It happens to be the frontier right now." 
</P>
<P>
 This particular frontier, Sistema Huautla, is a 35-mile-long complex of 
interconnected deep limestone caverns in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Previous 
attempts at exploration of the cave were stopped by a passage flooded to the 
ceiling with water. No scuba diving equipment was adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not rappelling down a shaft or swimming through nearly opaque water 
underground, Stone, 41, is a research structural engineer at the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 With eight colleagues, he designed a life-support system that allows a swimmer 
to remain underwater for 6 to 8 hours -- twice that when two units are joined. 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal was a "sump" at the deepest known point in the Mexican cave where 
the water completely filled the sloping tunnel. The explorers were to don their 
backpacks and swim into the watery obstacle, seeking a way on to presumed 
air-filled passages on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot get to where we got this year with traditional scuba-diver 
apparatus," he said. "It's just too inefficient, blowing away all that gas 
every time you breathe underwater." 
</P>
<P>
 His device is based on the space-suit principle, but it's more complicated 
because built-in computers adjust a helium-oxygen mixture for the diver, while 
astronauts set and forget their pure oxygen flow. Exhaled gas is recirculated 
to remove carbon dioxide by a special process. 
</P>
<P>
 Cave explorers carry in their heavy equipment and supplies and bring most of 
it out. Their ethic is not to litter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten thousand feet of rope, over 100 shafts you have to go up and down every 
time you carry something to the dive site," Stone said of the Mexican cave. 
"You are also carrying your body weight in addition to whatever your cargo is." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone weighed 210 pounds when he left home on Jan. 15 and 189 when the 
expedition ended in June. The weight-saving effort extends to food, too. The 
explorers grind freeze-dried food into dust, and compress it into gallon-sized 
plastic bottles to avoid carting the foil wrappers in and out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can get 15 man-days' worth of food in a gallon," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the underwater passage, Stone's team -- which numbered up to 20 at 
times -- rigged more than two miles of rope down large, steeply descending 
tunnels, following a river most of the way. There were 60 sheer drops -- the 
longest 360 feet -- in inky blackness punctuated by the hiss of falling water 
and lit only by the puny glow of their headlamps. 
</P>
<P>
 The cavers also needed to string ropes to cross 30 other places where the 
boiling underground river was too dangerous to wade or swim. 
</P>
<P>
 The air temperature was near 70 degrees -- fresh and pure. But with 100% 
humidity, the cavers sweated profusely inside their colorful nylon coveralls as 
they hauled 50-pound loads of gear across giant rock falls in monstrous 
chambers with ceilings too high to be seen, across slippery surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The first members of the team to make test dives into the deep sump were Noel 
Sloan, 40, of Indianapolis; Steve Porter, 41, of McKinney, Tex.; and Ian 
Rolland, 30, of St. Andrews, Scotland. They laid 800 feet of guideline at 
depths up to 80 feet underwater to find their way back out. Four days later, 
Rolland and Kenny Broad, 28, of Miami, began diving in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 They poked into numerous dead ends before Broad succeeded in finding a way 
through the sump -- a final distance of 1,400 feet underwater where visibility 
often was less than five feet. On an ensuing trip, Rolland was continuing in an 
air-filled chamber beyond the sump when he apparently had a hypoglycemic 
blackout caused by diabetes. He had the treatment in his pocket, two power 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The insidious thing about hypoglycemia is that it impairs your judgment 
first," said Stone, who labored for six days with others to bring the body out. 
"Had he eaten those two candy bars, he would still be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone and Barbara am Ende, 34, a student at the University of North Carolina, 
made the final dives that got them through yet another sump and into huge 
air-filled tunnels. They found more than a mile of tunnels -- sometimes more 
than 150 feet wide -- and six more sumps they were able to bypass. But they 
finally were stopped by another massive underwater tunnel, named Sump 9, that 
they couldn't get around. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone and far from any help, they decided they had explored far enough. 
Whatever lies beyond Sump 9 will have to await future expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Where they stopped, Stone said, is considered the most remote point yet 
reached by humans inside the Earth, 4,839 feet deep and miles from where they 
entered the cave. 
</P>
<P>
 He figures there's another 3 miles as the crow flies from the point where the 
explorers left off to the springs. That's probably many miles through twisting 
underground tunnels and about two years of effort. He may try it next year, 
during the dry season, starting at the springs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jules Verne's 19th-Century vision, the explorers reached the center of the 
Earth, where monsters roamed and great storms raged. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, humans have managed to penetrate the 7,900-mile diameter of the Earth 
only to a depth of 8,000 or so feet -- in shafts of the diamond mines of South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't keep people like Stone from trying to go deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The indescribable lure of the whole thing is putting that footprint there," 
he said. "Just as Neil Armstrong was trying to get on the moon, being the first 
human being ever to see terra firma incognita is what it's all about, going 
into the black unknown."

SOUTH PACIFIC'S HEALERS MAY HOLD NATURE'S ANCIENT CURES; HEALTH: PAUL ALAN COX 
IS TAPPING INTO ISLAND MEDICINES TO BATTLE AIDS AND OTHER ILLNESSES. BUT TIME 
IS SHORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEG McENTEE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Alan Cox, ethnobotanist, Fulbright scholar and Harvard Ph.D., thought he 
could spend three months with Samoan healing women and completely absorb their 
medical wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade later, he laughs at his presumption. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me three months just to learn their medical lexicon," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was absolutely fluent in Samoan, but it was like hitting a brick wall. It 
was like talking to a Ph.D. in pharmacology." 
</P>
<P>
 Now 40, Cox has built a career on seeking the knowledge of South Pacific 
healers who use plants to make draughts and poultices that could be as useful 
to modern medicine as to their Polynesian patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His quest has urgency. The rain forests, with their botanical treasures, are 
shrinking. Many elderly healers have no apprentices. And Cox is one of a few 
scientists working in the field of ethnobotany, a discipline that depends as 
much on understanding the practitioners of folk medicine as the plants they 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time one of the healers dies, it's like having a library burned," said 
Cox, a professor at Brigham Young University. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a race against time, because there are so few of us doing this work," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who died today? Maybe there's someone we never met who could have helped 
someone with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's." 
</P>
<P>
 It is estimated that of 265,000 flowering species of plants on earth, less 
than half of 1% have been studied exhaustively. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, their potential is manifest in the number of familiar drugs derived 
from plants -- aspirin, codeine, ipecac and quinine among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox estimates he has a 1-in-30 chance of finding a plant that could produce a 
pharmaceutical compound. But his work may already have borne fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Cox was told by Samoan healers about a rain forest tree whose 
pulverized wood was steeped into a brew and used to treat yellow fever. He sent 
it to the National Cancer Institute, which isolated an antiviral compound 
called prostratin. The NCI now considers prostratin a candidate for clinical 
trials as a possible therapy for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gordon Cragg, chief of the natural products branch at NCI, said Cox's 
discovery is the only lead on an anti-AIDS agent to come from an ethnobotanist, 
although others are studying plants for the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Cragg emphasized that prostratin and the other compounds are being tested in 
the laboratory only, and any treatment for humans is a distant goal. And 
because the NCI focuses on AIDS and cancer, not such ordinary ailments as fever 
or diarrhea that an indigenous healer might treat, the applications at NCI are 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cragg said, the isolation of prostratin is a "very convincing 
demonstration of the power of ethnobotany." 
</P>
<P>
 For Cox, even a slim chance of finding a way to help AIDS patients is 
exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm holding a lottery ticket, prostratin, and it might work and it might 
not," he said. "But what a grand game to be in!" 
</P>
<P>
 Cox also learned of an anti-inflammatory compound deriving from the bark of 
another tree. Scientists at two Eastern pharmaceutical companies are developing 
the compound as a topical anti-inflammatory. 
</P>
<P>
 A Utah native whose father was a park ranger and mother a fisheries biologist, 
Cox comes by his passion naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Mormon missionary in Samoa, he learned the language and fell in love with 
the people and islands. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Utah for a bachelor's degree at BYU, won a Fulbright to the 
University of North Wales, then went to Harvard for a doctorate in rain forest 
biology. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Cambridge that he met ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes, who in 
the early 1980s helped swing the pendulum of research back from the synthetic 
drug development that had supplanted the search for natural sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years of research at Berkeley followed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, he packed up his four young children and wife Barbara, a 
mathematician, and went to live and work for a year on Savaii, in Western 
Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
 Life was primitive but sweet -- every morning he and his wife dragged out a 
duffel bag full of textbooks and "hut-schooled" their kids. Cox made himself 
the healers' apprentice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He has worked elsewhere -- Tonga, Fiji, Australia, Africa and Costa Rica, 
among other places -- and speaks Samoan, Tongan, Spanish and Bishlama, the 
language of the Solomon Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 But Samoa remains a special place. 
</P>
<P>
 All healers are women who pass on their knowledge to their daughters. There 
are four specialties: the fofo, or massage healer; fofogau, bone-setter; 
fa'atosaga, midwife; and the taulesea, herbalists who make medicine from 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are male chiefs, the stewards of the land, who must be asked in the 
resplendent rhetoric they favor before the healers can be consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might be talking to a Samoan chief wearing a wraparound (garment) and with 
an enormous tattoo on his chest, and he sounds like an Oxford don speaking to 
me," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are quacks, of course. Cox tells of a Samoan man who claimed he was a 
healer -- already a sure tip-off -- and "diagnosed" his patients by stirring a 
box full of auto parts with a stick. 
</P>
<P>
 The true healer typically can identify 200 species of plants in her 
environment and each one's application and has a very specific vocabulary of 
biological forms, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, respect is paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell my students, 'If you can sit in a hut and respect the person, they can 
feel that, no matter what. Live your life with indigenous people as if at any 
moment they could read your heart -- because they probably can."' 
</P>
<P>
 So well assimilated is Cox that he was made a chief himself, in the village of 
Falealupo. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his Utah-based Seacology Foundation, he helped establish a 65,000-acre 
rain forest preserve where the plant that produces prostratin was found. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the foundation built schools and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Using a solar-powered laptop in the field, Cox takes care to type his notes in 
the native language, then lets his teachers proof his work. 
</P>
<P>
 He also believes they are entitled to the same intellectual rights as any 
researcher, and that any significant royalties from a drug like prostratin 
should be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider them to be informants but colleagues," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within this decade, we'll have drugs prescribed in this country that came 
straight from a 'witch doctor's' pouch."

GREEN PARTY AIMS AT NEW MEXICO; POLITICS: SLATE FOR THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS 
INCLUDES A FORMER TWO-TERM DEMOCRATIC LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, NOW RUNNING FOR 
GOVERNOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY MASSEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a Western state where environmentalists feud with ranchers, miners and 
loggers, the Green Party hopes to reap political gains from the seeds of public 
discontent with government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Green Party, trying to broaden its political base beyond the environmental 
movement, has fielded a slate of candidates in the Nov. 8 general election. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the campaign season under way, Democrats worry that the Green 
gubernatorial ticket could take votes from Gov. Bruce King and help elect a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-party campaigns historically have fizzled in New Mexico, but the Green 
Party earned a measure of overnight political credibility by selecting a former 
two-term Democratic lieutenant governor, Roberto Mondragon, as its candidate 
for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondragon was King's running mate in the 1970s and '80s, but he supported a 
King rival during this year's three-way Democratic primary election campaign. 
The incumbent won with 39% of the vote, and a recent poll showed King facing a 
very tight general election race. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Mondragon's supporters could really be a swing element in this election. 
There's no doubt about that," said F. Chris Garcia, a political scientist at 
the University of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Those supporters include liberals dissatisfied with King, a 
moderate-to-conservative Democrat and rancher. Hispanics, who traditionally 
back Democrats and account for a third of New Mexico's voting-age population, 
represent a critical but uncertain element of Mondragon's constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll get a lot of Hispanic votes," predicted state Auditor Robert Vigil, who 
is among a group of Democrats withholding their support from King. "The fact 
that he's a Hispanic on the ballot will have more impact than (that) he's a 
Green Party candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondragon, 54, hasn't campaigned for office since he lost in a 1982 Democratic 
primary for a congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
 But he remains well known, especially in Hispanic-dominated counties of 
north-central New Mexico. He's a popular guitar-playing performer of 
traditional Hispanic folk music. For years, he has been host of a 
Spanish-language radio program. He had a small role in the movie "The Milagro 
Beanfield War." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Mondragon's candidacy so unpredictable -- and possibly potent -- is 
the strange brew of politics fermenting in the Democratic and Republican 
parties this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the political season, King faced low ratings in opinion polls 
despite a booming state economy. In the primary, King's two Democratic 
challengers -- including the current lieutenant governor -- criticized him as a 
caretaker governor who has failed to prepare the state for growth. 
</P>
<P>
 King, 70, has been governor longer than anyone in New Mexico history, having 
won election to four-year terms in 1970, 1978 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In a four-way primary, the Republicans nominated Gary Johnson, 41, a 
millionaire construction company owner who is making his first bid for elective 
office. He is trying to appeal to voters as a government outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Mondragon, whose gray beard and long gray hair make him look more like a 
member of the Grateful Dead than a politician. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a mid-July poll by the Albuquerque Journal, 9% of those surveyed 
said they supported Mondragon. Johnson was the choice of 37%, 29% backed King 
and about a quarter of those surveyed were undecided. The poll had a margin of 
error of 4 percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for the Greens is to broaden the party's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 If viewed by voters mostly as environmentalists, the Greens face trouble, 
Garcia says. People put environmental quality at the bottom of their concerns 
in polls this year. Crime and the economy ranked at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Greens haven't focused on environmental issues. Mondragon talks 
instead about incentives for small businesses, property tax revisions and 
campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Green candidates are running for lieutenant governor, state treasurer, 
land commissioner and a congressional seat. But some Democrats have filed an 
election law challenge that could knock the Greens off the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mondragon insists there's a chance to win the governor's race if the Greens 
reach out to people frustrated and angry with government. And, in small ways, 
the Greens already seem intent on running a mainstream campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondragon appeared at a recent news conference in his usual work shirt, blue 
jeans and boots -- a far cry from the suit and tie or sport jacket and bolo tie 
favored by most New Mexico politicians -- but he had changed. Gone was his long 
ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people . . . have said that we need to look like we're very serious 
about this campaign," said Mondragon. "After three haircuts, how much more 
serious can I get?"

ROBIN ABCARIAN: DON'T LET THE SPIRIT CRUSHERS GET YOU DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The spirit crushers are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they are your parents, sometimes teachers. Often they are your 
bosses. They can just as easily be friends or colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Spirit crushers are the ones who tell you why you can't do what you dream of 
doing. That you can't possibly succeed. That you should try, oh, learning to 
type when what you really want to learn is neuroscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows what makes them tick. Self-loathing? Arrogance? A misguided sense of 
preparing you for the harshness of the real world? 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't matter. They always leave a mark. 
</P>
<P>
 My friend Alison is one of the smartest people I know. She crossed paths with 
a spirit crusher in her first college class. He was a teaching assistant in a 
humanities class at UC Berkeley. He graded the very first paper she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't remember what grade she got. 
</P>
<P>
 But she will never forget his scrawl across the page, seared into her memory 
like a brand: "Your problem is you don't know how to think." 
</P>
<P>
 Her reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was actually devastating," she says. "I won't ever forget it. I thought, 
why bother? I should just drop out of school." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the season when students return in droves to school, and schools are 
often where spirit crushers reign. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish there were some sort of inoculation against them. But all you've got 
are your wits. 
</P>
<P>
 You may not be able to control the "helpful" impulses of the spirit crushers, 
but you can learn not to be ruined. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Jo Anne Tracy, single mother to a 6-year-old boy, was an 
undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz, dreaming of becoming a researcher. She earned 
money doing clerical work at the school's "re-entry center," which provided 
support to returning students. 
</P>
<P>
 Her spirit crusher was a man who worked as a counselor (!) at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, I went in very excitedly to tell him about a professor who had just 
told me I should apply for graduate school," Tracy says. "He was shocked -- 
just stunned -- and he started an argument with me. He ranted and raved and 
finally said, 'Let's face it, Jo Anne, you're just not graduate school 
material.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt devastated. . . . I knew I had to go out right away and find people to 
tell me more encouraging things or it would kill me." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Jack Riley was a first-year student in a Ph.D. program. He was 
captivated with the idea of studying the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he had a conversation with a man who he describes as a "shining beacon 
of all Russian research." Riley was complaining to the man that he was having 
trouble compiling research for his dissertation prospectus. 
</P>
<P>
 "His response to me was, 'You don't know pain and suffering and you are never 
going to be a good Sovietologist because you have learned your Russian out of a 
book. And your people have not suffered enough.' It was just a crushing blow," 
Riley says. "To this day, I'm sure he has no idea how devastating and insulting 
his comments were." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us are better than others at developing an internal voice that drowns 
out the roar of the spirit crushers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Anne Tracy made a beeline for people she knew would encourage her, and, 
next spring, when she is 35, she will receive her doctorate in neuroscience 
from USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Riley, 30, found a sympathetic ear in another adviser, who offered him 
the opportunity to work on a project involving international drug policy. 
Riley, who completed his doctorate, hopes to publish a book -- his first -- on 
the international cocaine trade this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy with what I do now," Riley says. "I should probably send that 
guy a thank-you note." (I imagine Riley also finds no small consolation in the 
breakup of the Soviet Union.) 
</P>
<P>
 And my friend Alison finished college anyway -- she graduated with honors and 
became a newspaper editor, arguably a profession that requires the ability to 
think. 
</P>
<P>
 The spirit crushers are always out there, always ready to pounce on your 
aspirations, to tell you why you aren't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're kind of like the bogyman. They only have power if you believe in 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 So don't believe in them. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, they don't believe in you.

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: CARE FOR A GLASS OF BEER WITH THAT BREAKFAST?

<P>
 The front door is flanked by two signs; the one on the left reads, 
"Mother-Baked Pies," while the one on the right says, "Dodgers/Lite Beer." 
Inside, over pastel banquettes, the Miller Genuine Draft Girl beams bustily 
from between two bland posters of Monet waterlilies. The jukebox plays easy 
listening. Three television sets are turned on in the small bar -- two of them 
tuned to the NFL, the third showing Fred and Ginger on the arts channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick -- is this your dentist's waiting room, or the neighborhood tavern? 
Well, maybe a little of both.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the cocktail lounge of the Denny's Restaurant on San Fernando Road. 
Bartender, a double Novocain, please. 
</P>
<P>
 In the corner, a young couple sits close together, sipping cocktails. Is this, 
er, a date? They won't say. Four twentysomethings saunter in, order margaritas 
and burgers, and proceed to shoot the breeze. When "Get Smart" comes on the TV 
over their heads they fall silent, with that special narcoleptic reverence 
young Angelenos have for bad television. Welcome to Denny's Nation. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of railway workers share a pitcher of beer after work. They are fun, 
friendly guys who don't want their names in the paper. "You want a real bar, 
you should go up to the Marie Callender's in Glendale," one of them says. 
"That's where I usually go. It's like 'Cheers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "And they have big mugs of beer there," his friend adds wistfully. "Schooners 
of beer." 
</P>
<P>
 A woman sits alone in a banquette drinking coffee and working diligently on 
her second pack of Marlboro Lights while devouring a paperback bestseller. 
Occasionally, she stops to warm her hands over her cigarette lighter, 
complaining to herself of the cold. "She's here all the time," one of the 
railway workers whispers. "Always reading." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter and Betty Nelmark have stopped in to split a Grand Slam breakfast 
before heading home. "When I moved here in 1958 this used to be a Van de 
Kamp's," Betty says. "We used to come here all the time. They had a drive-in 
with waitresses on roller skates. I was shocked when I saw that this is a 
Denny's. But we like Denny's." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever we travel we look for Denny's," adds Walter Nelmark, who then begins 
to reminisce about the couple's previous searches for Denny's. "There was that 
trip we took on Highway 50 in Nevada. They call it the loneliest highway in the 
world." He stares into space, perhaps still moved by the memory of it. "Just 
miles and miles and miles of nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see what prompts the memory. You can have your Dresden Room, so 
self-consciously hip and coy. Existential purists will find that, like the 
desert, there is something soulful in the very vacuousness of this place, that 
endless possibilities lie in its expanses of poetic nothingness. Isn't this, 
after all, what we all came West for? As the free bumper sticker says, "It's 
never too late at Denny's."

 The social event of summer '94? In our wanna-be-buffed-up world, it was easily 
the reopening of the Sports Club/LA, which had suffered severe earthquake 
damage. We don't know if folks bought new sweats and sneaks for the occasion, 
but there were about 50 eager beavers lined up before doors opened at 5:30 a.m. 
on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 More joy was experienced when management passed out free designer water and 
fruit to one and all, since neither the cafe nor restaurant had yet reopened. 
(The restaurant finally opened Thursday).

<P>
 As one StairMaster fiend told us: "Everyone felt like a major part of their 
lives had been reclaimed."

 A Bob Cut: Our newest Robert Shapiro sighting: Last Saturday at the Jose Eber 
Salon on Rodeo Drive. What was O.J. Simpson's tanned defense attorney doing 
there? He was getting his hair cut, as he always does, by Monsieur Eber. That 
was in the afternoon. Shapiro was actually making his second visit of the day 
-- he had already been in that morning for his pedicure.

 Love for Sale: Flipping through the catalogue for Sotheby's Sept. 26 jewelry 
auction, we came across a touching item tucked away as lot No. 344. There, 
included among several bibelots from the estate of Barbara Hutton, the 
much-married Woolworth heiress who died in 1979, was a small 14-karat gold 
ashtray engraved, "Merry Christmas to my darling Mummy from Lance." Lance 
Reventlow, Hutton's son, died in 1972. Hutton, we are told, gave the ashtray as 
well as several other treasures to a friend who decided to put them up for 
sale. The auction items go on view Friday through next Sunday at Sotheby's, 
Beverly Hills.

WESTSIDE WATCH: UCLA WILL BE SKIRTING THE ISSUE OF CELTIC PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you see dozens of men clad in plaid skirts running around UCLA, it's not 
frat house high jinks. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be Irishmen getting ready for Celticfest 1994, a celebration of 
Celtic culture that will bring together skirted bagpipers in traditional dress 
-- Irish step dancers, Highland dancers in tartans and others -- for a festival 
believed to be the first of its kind in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is scheduled for this weekend at Sunset Intramural Field near the 
corner of Sunset and Westwood boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting all this Celtic culture on display is really a beautiful thing," said 
Allyn Anderson, vice president of the Southern California Irish Fair 
Foundation, the primary sponsor of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you're hungry, forget about sun-dried tomatoes, and make way for some 
good old Celtic cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters urge people to try the "tasty and delicious Celtic foods -- bangers, 
meat pies, Irish sausages and Cornish pasties."

 IS BEVERLY HILLS BURNING?: This is the city known for oh-so-chic dinner 
parties and diamond-studded celebs roaming ritzy Rodeo Drive, but we would like 
to point out a couple of recent incidents that may help counter assumptions 
that Beverly Hills is free from serious, if not frightening, incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 This from the files of the Beverly Hills cops: 
</P>
<P>
 Things seemed to be going OK at a dominoes game at a party the other week. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until a player pulled a semiautomatic handgun from his waistband and 
fired at his opponent in a dispute over the score of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't end there. 
</P>
<P>
 The opponent was not injured; the gunman was. 
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers chased him outside and pummeled him, leaving him with a fractured 
skull and crushed larynx. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills police say they will probably arrest the gunman, who is in fair 
condition at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, when he is well enough to be booked 
on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 And then consider the case of the armed robber who recently went to the 
trouble not only to break into a home, but also to herd its occupants into a 
bedroom, forcing a teen-age boy out of a bathtub in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandit's take? $6. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all the money the four people in the house had on them, police said. 
(In Beverly Hills?) Nobody was injured, and the robbery took all of five 
minutes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we wonder, where is Axel Foley when you need him.

A STRONG RECOVERY; HEALTH CARE: A $32-MILLION EARTHQUAKE REPAIR PROJECT WILL 
ALLOW ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL, MINUS ITS NORTH WING, TO REOPEN TO INPATIENT 
SERVICES OCT. 3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine months ago, the Northridge earthquake put an end to inpatient services at 
St. John's Hospital and Health Center, leaving walls ripped apart and sending 
eerie, X-shaped cracks up and down the facility's exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hundred patients were evacuated. About 1,750 jobs were lost. And the 
Santa Monica hospital was plunged into self-examination: How to re-create the 
hospital in the face of the massive changes under way in the health-care 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is still out on exactly how the St. John's of the future will look. 
But the facility, long considered one of the leading hospitals in Los Angeles 
County, has largely recovered from its physical wounds. With $32 million in 
repairs completed, St. John's will open in two weeks -- minus its north wing -- 
for inpatient services. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a high level of excitement and spirit in getting back to work and 
seeing patients here again," said Bruce Lamoureux, chief operating officer for 
the hospital. "It is all at once overwhelming and very, very exciting. We have 
learned tremendous things." 
</P>
<P>
 The opening is scheduled for Oct. 3 at 5 a.m. But the hospital plans to herald 
the event with a picnic and parade Saturday and a ribbon-cutting ceremony, with 
Gov. Pete Wilson in attendance, on Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 What the temblor did in half a minute has taken hordes of laborers 256 days to 
mend. The hospital's main and south wings, both badly damaged in the quake, 
were reinforced, from the foundation to the top floor, with 14-by-18-inch 
vertical steel columns and horizontal beams. The steel braces added roughly 2 
1/2 feet of width to the buildings' exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 The main wing's foundation had to be excavated and replaced. The east and west 
wings of the hospital, only cosmetically damaged, have had their cracks filled 
and repainted. But the most severely damaged building, the north wing, has been 
demolished, leaving only a dirt lot with chalked concentric circles marking the 
spot of the former rose garden. The empty space, at least temporarily, will be 
used for modular buildings that will replace the north wing's lost auditorium, 
which had been used for community education and conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Terry Muldoon, St. John's director of engineering and 
construction, the buildings are structurally stronger than they were before the 
earthquake because of the cross-directional steel frames. 
</P>
<P>
 But within five years, the buildings must begin retrofitting to comply with 
seismic hospital safety codes or be replaced, Muldoon said. State hospital 
building officials required medical buildings with more than 10% in lateral and 
vertical damages to fully comply with current state codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that such upgrading would be overwhelming, officials allowed 
hospital administrators to develop a long-term plan to bring the facility into 
compliance with hospital building codes. In the interim, buildings were brought 
up to the codes that were in place the year that the structures were erected. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the main wing had to be repaired to meet at least the 1936 codes, and 
the south wing has been restored to at least 1968 codes, said Shell Culp, 
spokeswoman for the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. The 
east and west wings were built in 1974. The north wing was constructed in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 A strategic planning committee is at work on a master plan for the long-term 
seismic improvements and is scheduled to release a report in January, Muldoon 
said. A cost estimate has not yet been made, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As they promised, hospital administrators hired back many of their former 
employees. About 90% of the 1,000 positions -- have been filled by former St. 
John's employees, with their seniority maintained and at the same rate of pay, 
according to Gary Miereanu, hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Inpatient beds were reduced from 501 to about 260. Most of the 1,200 
physicians who had privileges at the hospital have maintained them. Only the 
neonatal intensive care unit, which was housed in the hospital's north wing, 
has not been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nurses and other employees returning to St. John's, the past two weeks 
of orientation have been a little like a family reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is hugging everybody, and that first hour was really like seeing 
your family after a year," said Mary Tomassini, a 34-year employee. "We really 
care about each other and we really care about the hospital. It's so good to be 
home."

IN SEEKING WORK DESPITE LAW, DAY LABORERS TRY RESIDENTS' PATIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By EFRAIN HERNANDEZ Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each time a car stopped near the entrance of the HomeBase store in Ladera 
Heights, the men eager for work scrambled to talk to the driver. 
</P>
<P>
 The jostling and chatter lasted only several seconds before one, perhaps two 
men climbed into a car and drove away with someone needing cheap labor for a 
home improvement project or some other work. The remaining men retreated to the 
shade of nearby palm trees and took a seat, or stood and waved, trying to get 
the attention of the next potential employer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we'll just help people put things into their vehicles," Rogelio 
Camarena, 20, said in Spanish as he stood by the store's Fairfax Avenue 
entrance. "They give us some change or whatever they have available." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that such curbside job solicitation in unincorporated areas was 
outlawed by a county ordinance that took effect July 1. It is a misdemeanor 
that carries a sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcement of the ordinance, which supporters believed would help rid 
neighborhoods of day laborers and stem illegal immigration, is being watched 
closely by several groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union. 
Complaints by Ladera Heights homeowners led to the law. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, authorities, neighbors and the day laborers give varying views of 
whether the ordinance has done any good, especially because no day laborers or 
employers had been arrested as of last week. Some of those involved aren't 
convinced that behavior often criticized by neighbors and authorities -- such 
as rowdiness and public urination -- has decreased in the last several weeks, 
and several say a severe crackdown still is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're even more obvious," said Donald C. Hellwig, who has owned a home in 
the area for 24 years. "I drive by there every morning. It really hasn't 
changed. It's just too much." 
</P>
<P>
 But Faz Elahi, a local homeowner since 1972, said that lately the day laborers 
seem to be less disruptive to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard any more complaints," said Elahi, 57. "The people are here, 
so what are you going to do with them? The fact is they are human beings and we 
have to take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are local residents such as Nancy Hayward, who stopped shopping 
in the area a while ago because of the aggressiveness of the day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just all over you like a cheap suit," said Hayward, 48, who has owned 
a home in the area for about seven years. "I feel like the people who 
congregate are so desperate it doesn't really matter to them that they're 
breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gary Schoeller, commanding officer of the Marina del Rey sheriff's 
station, which patrols Ladera Heights, said efforts to discourage people from 
hiring the workers have been somewhat effective. But the day laborers continue 
to gather in hopes of getting jobs, so an unofficial grace period may run out 
before long, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Schoeller declined to provide details regarding any upcoming 
crackdowns on the day laborers, he acknowledged that more must be done about 
the groups of men who gather along Fairfax and Slauson avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deputies have been over there every day. This is a county ordinance and 
it is illegal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoeller said authorities will continue to distribute written warnings about 
the county ordinance to laborers and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The day laborers in Ladera Heights are most evident from 7 a.m. to about noon, 
he said. "If they don't have a job by noon they generally give up. This is 
disorderly. It scares people. It brings concern to the community. It has to be 
resolved," Schoeller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Camarena and several of the 15 or so men gathered at the Fairfax Avenue 
entrance to the HomeBase store on Labor Day morning said they were only trying 
to earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
 Primo Danilo Pineda, 27, said he goes to the site seven days a week from about 
7 a.m to at least 4 p.m., depending on whether he lands a job. The workers are 
aware of the new law and most of those who were causing problems have tried to 
clean up their acts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that we must be polite to women and not urinate in public areas," 
Pineda said in Spanish. "We want to stay here and seek work so we all know to 
make sure no one gets out of line."

UCLA STUDENT SAYS MEDICAL CENTER STAFF HARASSED HIM; LAW: EMERGENCY ROOM 
EMPLOYEE'S SUIT SAYS HE WAS SUBJECTED TO VERBAL AND PHYSICAL ADVANCES BY 
HOMOSEXUAL CO-WORKERS. UNIVERSITY ATTORNEYS SAY HIS STORY IS INCONSISTENT. 
</P>

<P>
 When Scott D. Matthews started work in the UCLA Medical Center emergency room 
two years ago, he was, he says, the only heterosexual among eight male 
admitting workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Matthews, a premed student, is suing the UCLA Board of Regents, alleging 
that homosexual co-workers harassed him verbally and physically -- and that 
university administrators repeatedly ignored his complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about some pretty egregious stuff," said Michael Homeier, an 
attorney for Matthews. "Nobody should have to put up with this kind of 
condition in the workplace. It is shocking to me that an institution like UCLA, 
as big and wealthy as it is and on the cutting edge of knowledge, would have 
been so lax as to allow a situation like this to persist." 
</P>
<P>
 University lawyers reject Matthews' allegations, claiming his statements in 
the case have been riven with inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the problem with this case is the plaintiff's story has changed a 
number of times," said UCLA attorney Christopher Patti. "His initial complaints 
were about atmosphere, sexual jokes. He worried that because he worked there, 
people thought he was homosexual. Now the lawsuit contains a whole new set of 
allegations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matthews case illustrates a trend in such litigation: that sexual 
harassment claims these days are not always filed by women against men. Says 
Los Angeles attorney Joel P. Kelly, who is representing UCLA in the Matthews 
case: "We see cases filed by women against men, men against women, women 
against women, and men against men." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews, 24, alleges sexual harassment, retaliation, infliction of emotional 
distress and slander. He contends that in his 17 months on the job he was 
subjected to repeated sexual advances and proposals and lewd remarks. Male 
co-workers rubbed their genitals and buttocks against him and stroked his neck, 
back and arms, he claims in the lawsuit filed by Lewis W. Boies Jr., Matthews' 
lead attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 His supervisors, both homosexual, observed the harassment and permitted it to 
continue, Matthews claims. Although state law requires employers to investigate 
such complaints immediately and intervene, administrators ignored his initial 
reports except to inform his supervisors, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he sought help from the medical and administrative directors of the 
emergency room, the UCLA Affirmative Action Office and the Staff and Faculty 
Counseling Service, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Subjected to retaliation by his bosses and shunned by co-workers in a "hostile 
work environment," Matthews says, he went on an unpaid leave of absence in 
October, 1993, that remains in effect. He has begun his senior year, but has 
since abandoned his plans to attend medical school, deciding to pursue 
dentistry instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The university asserts that it responded adequately to Matthews' complaints. 
In September, two months after his initial complaint, its Human Resources 
Department conducted an investigation of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators concluded that there had been "gender harassment," a finding 
supported in a written statement by Aaron Lohr, deputy director of the medical 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I concur with the finding that there was gender harassment in the workplace," 
wrote Lohr. "This is based principally on verbal behaviors, i.e., generalized 
sexist or derogatory statements and behaviors which conveyed insulting or 
degrading attitudes on sexual orientation, gender or work group status." 
</P>
<P>
 However, defense attorneys say Matthews' harassment claims in his lawsuit are 
far different from the allegations he made -- and the university confirmed -- 
last September. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA lawyers also say that after the results of the investigation were in, 
Lohr recommended that the emergency room staff be educated as to "how behaviors 
are perceived" and taught to deal with "the challenges of a diverse work 
group." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Matthews' two supervisors and the medical and administrative 
directors of the emergency room were named as co-defendants, Superior Court 
Judge Alan B. Haber ruled this week that individuals cannot be held financially 
liable under the Fair Employment and Housing Act, the state law on which the 
lawsuit is based. 
</P>
<P>
 No trial date has been set. But at a hearing Monday, the judge also dismissed 
Matthews' claim that his employers discriminated against him because of his 
sexual orientation. The Fair Employment and Housing Act does not address that 
issue, Haber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rulings, unless successfully appealed by Matthews' lawyers, leave the 
student with a lawsuit against the Board of Regents, which in February rejected 
his claim for $305,000. He filed his suit in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing Scott wanted to do was to sue UCLA," Boies said. "But the 
university stonewalled him." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews filed charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and 
the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing in July, 1993, after 
declining several offers of alternative jobs at UCLA at the same pay. 
</P>
<P>
 His medical center job had "resume value," his lawsuit says. It offered 
"profound benefits for a premed student," such as a chance to work on actual 
cases, mingle with health professionals and learn medical terms while earning a 
salary, benefits and tuition credits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the treatment he received in the emergency room, it says, brought him 
"depression, anxiety, self-doubt, embarrassment, sleep disorders, lack of 
concentration . . . aversion to physical contact and suspicions of male 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for UCLA say the university has done everything possible to appease 
him and avoid a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe his claims are valid," UCLA's Patti says. "He made a 
complaint, and the university investigated it promptly and acted appropriately. 
Our offer of a comparable position is still open, and we could resolve the 
lawsuit on that basis."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The John C. Tyler Trust has granted Pepperdine University $32.5 million, the 
largest single financial contribution in its 57-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The university was named the chief beneficiary of the trust after the death of 
Alice Tyler last spring. She was the wife of John Tyler, co-founder of the 
Farmers Insurance Group, who died in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tylers were active in establishing a $150,000 university-sponsored prize 
for environmentalists as well as a student center on campus.

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; NEW YOUTH CLUB TO BE STATE-OF-THE-ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction will begin this week on a new Boys & Girls Club of Venice 
building to replace the dilapidated one on Lincoln Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 A groundbreaking ceremony for the James Collins Youth Center, named after the 
chairman of the board of Sizzler International, is scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, founded in 1968, offers sports, theater and other activities for 
youths 11 to 17. The club serves Venice's Oakwood neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great place for kids to do things in a safe environment," said 
Collins, who donated $300,000 toward the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "People saw the need to respond to the gang problems in this community. The 
more we can work with these kids on a positive basis, the more these kids can 
stay out of trouble," said founder David Mandell. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29,000-square-foot center will include a gymnasium, theater stage, game 
room, ceramics area and photography room. 
</P>
<P>
 It replaces the current center, which was fashioned from two one-bedroom 
apartments and a four-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old center is in total disrepair," said Mike Wise, president of the 
club's board of directors. He said the club still needs to raise about $1

 A summary of selected City Hall actions last week that affect the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * EXCEPTION DENIED -- Overturned a City Planning Commission action that would 
have allowed the construction of two 25-foot-tall houses at 8000-8010 
Mulholland Drive, thereby exempting them from the Mulholland Scenic Parkway 
Plan that calls for a 15-foot height limit on homes.Many residents and members 
of the Mulholland Scenic Parkway organization spoke against construction of the 
houses, saying that they and the planned 23-foot-tall wall around them would be 
an eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
 * EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM -- Approved a $136,000 contract with Emergency 
Response System Inc. to monitor and maintain 700 electronic devices for 
low-income residents who are 60 or older, frail or handicapped and who live 
alone. The devices alert a response center when the person is in need of 
emergency assistance. 
</P>
<P>

COVER STORY; MUSEUM CENTRAL; WILSHIRE BOULEVARD COLLECTIONS SPUR A RESURGENCE 
OF MIRACLE MILE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The doors of the old department store are opening once again to anxious 
patrons. The owners of another old department store building are drawing grand 
dreams for its future. And down the street, the whine of an electric saw 
signals yet another renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 A few more people are strolling along Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile 
district, maybe stopping in Johnie's for a cup of coffee or lingering by the 
statue of the prehistoric mom mired in the La Brea tar pits. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've come full-circle on the Miracle Mile," said Jack Kyser, chief 
economist with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. "At one time 
it was a very, very attractive destination. It went into decline, but all of a 
sudden it's starting to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Museums. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the stretch of Wilshire Boulevard from Fairfax to La Brea avenues 
has been home to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the George C. Page 
Museum of La Brea Discoveries. Then this summer, within one week, the Petersen 
Automotive Museum opened in the old Ohrbach's department store and the Museum 
of Miniatures opened down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The Craft and Folk Art Museum, closed since February, 1993, is scheduled to 
reopen after renovations are finished in March. And now, officials of the Los 
Angeles Children's Museum say they hope to move from downtown to part of the 
old May Company department store property recently purchased by the Museum of 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope the concentration of museums boosts the local economy. Museum 
patrons, who are often on a flexible schedule, are "impulse buyers" likely to 
stop at another museum, restaurant or store, Kyser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're going to a museum, you're not time-constrained," he said. "You 
don't want to rush." 
</P>
<P>
 And merchants hope the increased pedestrian traffic will help spur the area's 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a cultural center is a tremendous magnet," said John Murphy, executive 
director of the Miracle Mile Chamber of Commerce. "It's a huge attraction, both 
for tourists and for people who live in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Pedestrians once crowded Wilshire to shop, maybe heading from Ohrbach's to the 
May Company tearoom or a local eatery. When Barbara Castro started waiting 
tables at Johnie's Coffee Shop Restaurant 23 years ago, waitresses kept busy 
serving store employees on lunch break and customers carrying shopping bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber of Commerce President Steve Kramer remembers growing up on 6th Street 
-- and braving his parents' wrath by crossing Wilshire to the Thrifty's soda 
fountain. "It was a place to acquire baseball cards," he said. "It was pretty 
significant." 
</P>
<P>
 But like many urban shops and department stores, the businesses struggled with 
changing times and tastes -- shopping malls boomed in the suburbs, ravaging 
downtowns. Ohrbach's closed in 1986. The May Company tearoom shut down in 1991 
-- anguished patrons protested by threatening to cut up their charge cards -- 
and the rest of the store closed two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 A Thrifty's has been long gone. And even those longtime residents who are 
keeping score lost count of the times the old International House of Pancakes 
-- now an Indian restaurant -- changed hands. Johnie's is down from nine to 
four waitresses, and its owners have struggled to keep that many. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while it was getting very bad, a lot of graffiti" around the vacant 
department store buildings, said Johnie's owner, George Medenas. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the department stores were withering away, new office buildings 
were rising on the Miracle Mile. The opening of the Wilshire Courtyard office 
complex in 1988 helped spark a revival, luring businesses looking for a central 
location between Hollywood, downtown and the rest of the Westside, Kyser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Publications including Variety and the Hollywood Reporter now have offices on 
the Miracle Mile, and Motown Records is planning a move there from Hollywood at 
the end of the year, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Alpha-Beta grocery store is scheduled to open on Wilshire by the end of the 
year. Castro, the Johnie's waitress, is already noticing a few new faces 
stopping in for a lunch special or a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders and residents had that in mind when the department stores 
closed, said Lyn MacEwen Cohen, president of the Miracle Mile Civic Coalition. 
The group fought to save the May Company and Ohrbach's buildings, enlisting the 
support of County Supervisor Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without his support and the county taking a chance, it wouldn't have 
happened," MacEwen Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county helped finance the purchase and renovation of the Ohrbach's 
building for the automotive museum, which is a branch of the county Natural 
History Museum. The County Board of Supervisors in 1992 approved $28.5 million 
in tax-exempt financing for the Petersen, although the museum's private 
fund-raising arm is required to pay off most of the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The county agreed to chip in $400,000 a year -- the amount it spent to store 
the donated cars before the museum opened. Annual revenues were projected at 
$3.1 million -- more than double the Page Museum's or Natural History Museum's 
in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohrbach's "had been an abandoned and dilapidated department store building," 
Edelman spokesman Joel Bellman said. "Now it's wonderful. It's a 
revenue-producer. The building is spiffed up." 
</P>
<P>
 The county in January also provided the Museum of Art interim funding to 
purchase and renovate the May Company building. The museum is responsible for 
repaying the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a block east on Wilshire is the Museum of Miniatures. Museum owners 
Carole and Barry Kaye decided to move to the site when the museum, formerly 
known as the Petite Elite museum, outgrew its Century City office space. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most perfect and natural place for us to be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Craft and Folk Art Museum is another block to the east. The museum moved 
out of its building for renovations in 1989 and took up temporary residence in 
the May Company building. It moved its collection back in early 1993, but 
construction delays, partly due to the Jan. 17 earthquake, have pushed the 
scheduled reopening to next March, said spokeswoman Heather Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 The concentration of museums will allow visitors to turn a quick visit into a 
daylong outing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can make it a family day on a Sunday," she said. "You can park in one 
place, walk and see five museums." 
</P>
<P>
 The Museum of Tolerance on Pico Boulevard and other museums are also nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Museum of Art hasn't developed specific plans for the May Company 
building, but the museum would like to use at least part of the space for 
educational activities such as visual arts programs for children, said Wally 
Weisman, a member of the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would very much like to be able to enlarge and strengthen those programs," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Children's Museum, which is now squeezed into a Downtown space 
next to the Los Angeles Mall, has its eyes on part of the May Company property. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's museum hopes the new location would double attendance, said 
executive director Vincent Beggs. Children can only get to the museum's current 
location on buses, he said. In addition to contributing to the museum district, 
the Children's Museum would like to attract patrons on foot and bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have (Downtown) is not a neighborhood," he said. But on Wilshire, 
surrounded by apartment buildings and rows of bungalows, "we're going to see 
all these kids coming to the museum under their own power." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Children's Museum does fit into the Museum of Art's plans, the move 
would not be completed for several years, Beggs said. And it wouldn't please 
everyone, particularly Downtown businesses and residents hoping for 
revitalization there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a loss to Downtown L.A.," Kyser said. "We have to be concerned 
about the overall economic health" of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the county has been criticized by some of its own staff members for 
helping to open the Petersen when money is tight for the Page Museum and the 
main Natural History Museum in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than compete with Downtown, Kaye of the Museum of Miniatures said 
Miracle Mile can attract tourists who are otherwise bound for more famous 
attractions elsewhere -- potentially, a benefit for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people think of L.A., they think of Universal or Disneyland," she said. 
"They don't think of L.A. proper." 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials hope to change that. They're talking about starting 
cooperative efforts, maybe joint advertising campaigns or a museum consortium 
to coordinate their activities. Kramer said he'd like to see the museums open a 
joint holiday store with offerings from their gift shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses and residents plan to help. The civic coalition is producing 
Art-Deco street signs proclaiming, "Welcome to Museum Row on the Miracle Mile." 
A redevelopment of nearby Hancock Park, which will include landscaping and 
lighting, is scheduled to begin in November, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The civic coalition and Chamber of Commerce are also lobbying the city to redo 
the landscaping on Wilshire Boulevard and pushing for a "cultural trolley," an 
extension of a DASH shuttle bus route, from the Farmer's Market to the museums. 
</P>
<P>
 The new museums and other improvements will help the Miracle Mile build on 
what it already has: A real city neighborhood with a good mix of people, Kramer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone's an accountant, not everyone's a mom, not everyone's elderly, 
not everyone's a teen-ager," he said. "You get the sense that this is what a 
city is supposed to be about." Craft and Folk Art Museum

 Although visitors to the museums in the Miracle Mile area can see everything 
from a miniature French palace to the gas pump of the future, directors say the 
attraction is not cars or dolls but people: how they live and what they dream 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 The Petersen Automotive Museum chronicles the development of the car and its 
effects on lifestyles, architecture, entertainment and about everything else in 
Los Angeles. Director Richard Messer is a self-professed car guy, but he says 
you don't have to be one to appreciate the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a lot of non-car people," Messer said. "People are sending 
their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors wander over a fake roadway and can take a whiff of the authentic 
smells emanating from the display of an early auto garage. If they don't want 
to peer inside an antique car, they can peek through the windows of a 
Depression-era luxury car showroom or a replica of the famed Dog Cafe in Culver 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Museum of Miniatures is also attracting a diverse audience, from World War 
II veterans who remember driving a Sherman tank like the one recreated in a 
battle scene to teen-agers drawn to "Garage Art" figures. One of those is a 
Skull Warrior, a fanged beast swinging skulls on a chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really gruesome," said museum owner Carole Kaye. "We have something 
for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 More to her taste, she said, are the miniature Roman banquet hall, the tiny 
wooden chest with 6,000 pieces of inlay or the replica of a Hollywood Bowl 
performance by Louis Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is not only the oldest and most notable 
of the Miracle Mile museums, it's considered by some the finest 
general-interest art museum west of the Mississippi River, said Wally Weisman, 
a member of the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection ranges from the pre-Columbian era to contemporary art, 
including Japanese and Far-Eastern art, Indian art, collections of 19th-Century 
American and European paintings, mosaics, photography and a sculpture park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, the museum plans to expand its educational programs into the 
old May Company building west of the museum, Weisman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The George C. Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries displays thousands of fossils 
of saber-toothed cats, mammoths, camels, snails, birds, plants and "La Brea 
Woman," all of whom met a sticky death in what later became known as the tar 
pits. (It would be little consolation for them to know that they actually died 
in pools of asphalt, not tar.) 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, visitors can also have a peek at Pit 91, where scientists 
and volunteers are continuing to unearth 30,000-year-old fossils. And if 
they're not careful they can plant their shoes in the asphalt that continues to 
bubble through the sidewalks outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Craft and Folk Art Museum is scheduled to reopen in March, 1995 after 
renovations are completed on its building. The museum collection includes 
Mexican folk art, Japanese textiles and African and European crafts -- the 
stuff of everyday life from cultures represented in Los Angeles, said director 
Patrick Ela. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to stress the commonality between cultures, the universality of these 
objects people use for living," he said. JOHN BUZBEE

NUCLEAR-FAMILY BLUES: THE FISSION OF MORAL TIES THAT BIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stanley Crouch, Stanley Crouch, author of Notes of a Hanging Judge (Oxford), 
was a 1993 recipient of the MacArthur Foundation genius fellowship. He is 
currently finishing a biography of Charlie Parker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't unusual to hear the idea and the history of the nuclear family either 
elevated to an Olympian condition of domestic paradise or vilified as the 
source of all early and enduring prob lems. If one is listening to a proponent 
of the family, it is described as an answer to the problems that so pervade the 
cultural, political, social and spiritual lives of Americans. Mom, Dad, Sis and 
Bud, the dog and the gathering at the dinner table provide bulwarks against the 
disorder that has always dogged our society. From the responsible father and 
the understanding mother the wisdom of the culture is passed on, usually to a 
daughter and a son who recognize that age provides a clarity of understanding 
that is obviated by their youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Those on the other side see the family as a repository of every element of 
unfair power our democracy fights to reduce in the interest of individual 
freedom. They describe the traditional family as a patriarchal dictatorship, in 
which male privilege defines all parameters. There the father is, as one poet 
said, "just a big fat American wallet whose money gives him the right to 
oppress women and children." Women are subservient and children who resist will 
be twisted into the shapes determined by the head man. Rule is maintained by 
force, economic deprivation and psychological domination, the latter 
characterized by a willingness to use all means necessary to break the spirit 
attempting to run too freely. 
</P>
<P>
 While both sides allow us the stretch we need to see the possibilities of the 
home at its best and the horror that money and blood union can impose, our 
present condition is so shaky from coast to coast that those attempting to lead 
the country out of its social bog, whether Bill Clinton or Dan Quayle, see the 
re-establishment of family values as essential. Each recently talked of the 
importance of the family, of responsible adults shouldering the chores of moral 
grooming the country needs if it is to face the mirror with something other 
than a succession of grotesque masks dripping gooey sludge and swamp water. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure that the real context of our dilemmas are yet recognized by 
politicians or by the friends and the enemies of the family. There are harsh 
problems down in the decadent murk of the worst aspects our country, and they 
have less to do with the family unit than with the idea of what an individual 
is in our contemporary terms and what the relationship of that individual is to 
others, whether in or out of the family. Unless those aspects of our 
sensibility are examined, it won't really matter much if men and women stay 
married and their kids listen to their philosophies and emulate the ways in 
which they have become successful in the work place. 
</P>
<P>
 I say this because we can recognize the adolescent inclinations that have 
foreshadowed the crumbling of decadent aristocracies in which marriage stayed 
put and the kids were trained to do the tricks of culture in the arena of 
privilege. Marriage doesn't need to break down and families splinter in order 
for us to witness the dissolution of the kinds of discipline and generosity 
central to social vitality. All we need to understand is how far we move from 
the riches of democratic civilization when the central ambition of the 
individual is opposed to any demands outside what have become the accepted and 
insatiable appetites of the self. In our writing and our talk, we are so 
concerned with ourselves that almost any subject, no matter how worldly, is 
reduced to a metaphor that inspires the autobiographical anecdote. So our 
sickness rises up from the corruption of our sense of relationships and the 
re-education of all elements to tools or objects that service our 
self-obsession or get in its way. 
</P>
<P>
 This makes us very impatient when confronted by difficulties. We assume that 
somebody else should take care of them or that they exist primarily to deprive 
us of something so personal it has no general significance. F. Scott Fitzgerald 
recognized this tendency years ago in "The Great Gatsby" when he put Nick 
Carraway in a car driven by Jordan Baker, the cheating athlete. After Nick 
complains that Jordan is a terrible driver because she doesn't pay attention, 
she replies that she doesn't need to pay attention when everybody else on the 
road can! 
</P>
<P>
 When Fitzgerald was writing, he was describing the moral opaqueness of 
excessive privilege, the corruption and disdain that came of money, class and 
the willingness to ignore the effects of one's actions on others. Fitzgerald 
saw his people as children made malevolent by their narcissistic insensitivity. 
They were actors performing their interpretations of aristocracy. Their images 
and their appetites were more important to them than anything else. As 
spiritual small fry, they were too little to truly fit the big clothes of 
sophisticated sensibility they wore. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald's people now transcend all lines of social definition, ethnicity, 
sexual preference and whatever demarcations we once thought separated the 
sexes. It is easy to understand why marriages so easily fall apart, not only 
because of the economic freedom of women but also because the effort needed to 
face the difficulties of life is seen as some form of submission to an ideal 
that limits one's personal freedom. We are too impatient to stay together, to 
summon the will to understand what the meaning of "for richer or poorer, for 
better or worse, in sickness and in health." We want "to get on with our 
lives," whether that means fathering and abandoning children or snatching 
passion so cavalierly that we become teen-age mothers who assume society should 
pick up the tab for our unwillingness to practice preventive protection. In 
some fundamental sense, the worst of us have become notes in a massive 
orchestration of Jordan Baker's soul. 
</P>
<P>
 If we are to reassert the greatness that radiates from the foremost successes 
of our democracy, we will have to chose the demanding path of adulthood. We 
will have to grow up and learn again that heroic individuality asserts not only 
one's own identity but strives for wisdom and exhibits the compassionate 
integrity all societies must sustain if they are to face the inevitable 
difficulties central to our humanity and triumph over the self-serving impulses 
of decadence. Democratic moral consciousness is a vast and lumpy burden but it 
gives us all something we lose when we submit to the dictates of the moral 
opaqueness we collectively find so repulsive when played out to its most 
heartless extremes by the childish street criminals who presently damn so many 
of our lives.

A RELUCTANT WARRIOR; WITH HAITI, CLINTON REDEFINES THE POST-COLD WAR PRESIDENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sidney Blumenthal, Sidney Blumenthal is the special political correspondent 
for the New Yorker. He is the author of Pledging Allegiance: The Last Campaign 
of the Cold War (HarperCollins). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 War defined the presidency long before the Cold War. In this century, every 
President who came into office devoted to domestic policy was, sooner or later, 
confronted with having to direct foreign interventions. They stood as 
commanders at the center of total war. 
</P>
<P>
 No one seems more aware of the narrow confines of policy-making by use of 
force than President Bill Clinton. His speech Thursday night to arouse the 
nation to back his course in Haiti was filled with qualifications. "I know," he 
said, "that the United States cannot -- indeed, we should not -- be the world's 
policeman, and I know this is a time, with the Cold War over, that so many 
Americans are reluctant to commit military resources and our personnel beyond 
our shores." Clinton's case was spelled out with this large hesitation present 
in public opinion foremost in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The psychological momentum of the past impinges on Clinton. The intervention 
in Haiti, after all, may be just that -- certainly not a war as Americans have 
come to understand wars. Wars are associated with crisis, dire threats to 
national security, even to our existence. The mere mention of military action 
summons a range of deep feelings in the body politic: fear and anger, readiness 
and withdrawal. We may recall air-raid drills, missiles poised, threats and 
counterthreats. 
</P>
<P>
 The person ultimately in charge of disposing of these emotions has been the 
President. He is the chief executive of crisis management. At the moment of 
maximum peril, he is in command. Theburden has been almost beyond 
comprehension, making the President at once a figure who has been handed the 
responsibilities of near-megalomania and extreme caution. For years we have 
lived in a fail-safe system, fearful that with one mistake the Earth could blow 
up -- and it was all up to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton in Haiti begins inevitably to redefine the post-Cold War presidency -- 
hesitantly, indirectly, but necessarily. For this is a use of force that is not 
a crisis, an intervention that is not really a war. To win public support, 
Clinton has had to explain a policy that is, as he put it, "limited and 
specific." What he is conjuring with is more than the immediate situation. He 
is circling around the dominant image of the President in the 20th Century as 
warrior-chieftain. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of this century, presidential leadership has been defined by battle. 
The role of commander-in-chief came to overwhelm the other presidential roles. 
A President who is principally attending to domestic policy -- which can never 
be a clear-cut matter, always requiring constant quarrels and compromises with 
the Congress -- seems, after all the wars, not to be truly presidential. Only 
in combat, we have been led to expect, is the President filling the Oval Office 
with his authority. 
</P>
<P>
 All the great domestic-policy Presidents were overtaken by wars and became 
defined by them. Woodrow Wilson, the first of them, came to the presidency 
warning against interventions generally and heavily pledged to the Democratic 
Party's isolationist wing -- long headed by William Jennings Bryan, a true-blue 
Midwestern pacifist, whom Wilson appointed secretary of state. Yet, Wilson 
intervened in our hemisphere more than any previous President -- even invading 
and occupying Haiti. After World War I, Wilson was greeted in Europe as no 
American President had ever been before: A deus ex machina, a messiah who would 
miraculously settle all the animosities that had led to the conflagration. 
</P>
<P>
 The assistant secretary of the Navy under Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
partly modeled his early New Deal on the mobilization of World War I. But by 
1938, after suffering tremendous losses in the midterm election, reform ground 
to a halt. Roosevelt's presidency, however, was recast by the looming conflict 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 His successor, Harry S. Truman, envisioned himself as a domestic-policy man -- 
having little experience with foreign policy. In 1946, after losing both houses 
of Congress to the Republicans, Truman appeared diminished to the point of 
imminently vanishing. It was more than his battle royal with the "do-nothing 
Congress" that brought him back to life. It was also the Cold War, whose 
fundamental policies he and his secretaries of state, George C. Marshall and 
Dean G. Acheson, created. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point on, any conflict, large or small, was seen in the context of 
the struggle between the superpowers -- a struggle that could never reach 
culmination because it would mean, as the priesthood of nuclear theologians 
described it, "mutual assured destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents after Truman could maneuver, but they could not escape the Cold 
War. Their presidencies were framed by it. They all were shadowed by a 
ubiquitous military aide with "the football" in his briefcase -- "the football" 
being the codes to launch nuclear attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 More than any President of the Cold War, Lyndon B. Johnson wanted to have it 
all: the guns and the butter. His Great Society was intended to complete the 
work of New Deal, but his belief that he could do this and also commit vast 
resources to a widening war in Vietnam opened a chasm that became known as the 
"credibility gap." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard M. Nixon consistently made the claim that credibility was at the heart 
of the presidency and that it depended on trust in the President's war policy. 
Any doubt, he and his Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger suggested, radiated 
into an undermining of the U.S. position everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Reagan's presidency was the Cold War in its rococo phase: A succession 
of dying Soviet leaders; military actions in Grenada and against Libya, all 
tied together by the battle against the "Evil Empire," and the climax of the 
happy ending with Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
 For George Bush, the World War II pilot, there was no idea of the presidency 
apart from war. The invasion of Panama was, in fact, the first military action 
taken without mention of the Cold War -- though Bush made no explanation of the 
change. The Gulf War was a kind of valedictory to the wars of the 20th Century 
fought by our Presidents -- complete with Bush's borrowed rhetoric from Winston 
Churchill. When he left office, Bush's legacy included U.S. forces in Somalia 
and a policy of stalwart indifference to the roiling situation in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, by now, has learned that even in a radically new world and at a time 
when the public desperately wants foreign affairs to be kept at arm's length, 
presidential leadership and credibility can easily be eroded by them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War was a permanent state of crisis and mobilization suddenly 
relieved without a final conflict. For all its terrors, Presidents 
automatically gained stature and authority from it. So, it is not easy to be 
released from its momentum. Clinton must deal with problems that are not crises 
-- but may be perceived as such. He must clarify his reasons for action -- 
especially the use of force -- against threats that are real but not vital. Our 
means may seem infinite, with no rival superpower -- but our ends are far more 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 With Clinton, it appears that nothing comes easily. He is assailed as 
indecisive, a veritable waffle, only seeking approbation. On Haiti, however, he 
is attacked by his opponents as taking too precipitous an action, flying in the 
face of overwhelming public opinion. Yet, the threat of invasion was a prelude 
to a final gesture of diplomacy: On Friday, Clinton enlisted former President 
Jimmy Carter to head a delegation that included former Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff Colin L. Powell and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman 
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) -- good cop, bad cop, bad cop. The mission was to persuade the 
generals in Port-au-Prince to leave the country -- now. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, if successful in Haiti, may be seen as having negotiated his first 
real crisis. For what we encounter in Haiti, among other things, is a crisis in 
our perception of the presidency.

A RELUCTANT WARRIOR; THE NIGHTMARE THAT IS HAITI: GUNSHOTS IN THE QUIET OF 
NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Anne-christine d'Adesky, Anne-christine d'Adesky, a Haitian-American 
journalist, is author of Under the Bone (FSG), a novel about Haiti. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The eve of change, whether by invasion, coup d'etat or election, is the most 
dangerous time in Haiti, and the quiet night, from dusk to dawn, is the 
scariest. That is when all ears strain for the sound of faint gunshots, knowing 
the hunt is on. Almost 80 years after the first U.S. invasion of Haiti, I am 
lying awake thinking this in the middle of the night. I am not with my friends, 
family or colleagues in Haiti because I have taken a public position against 
the regime and been warned to stay away. But my heart, my eyes and ears are 
with them and I feel that familiar tightening of emotions -- fear, 
anticipation, dread, conflict and hope -- that characterize life and political 
struggle in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to know where my friend Evans Paul, the pro-democratic mayor of 
Port-au-Prince, is tonight. Which safe house he will seek refuge in, whether 
they will find him. Evans is among the most visible figures of Haiti's popular 
resistance to dictatorship, a resistance largely ignored by the Western media. 
More than 500 Haitians have been killed these past three years, but 300,000 
have survived and are in hiding -- like Paul. If the generals fall, those in 
hiding will be ready to help Jean-Bertrand Aristide rebuild Haiti, and that is 
why they must die now, before the Americans arrive to protect them. That is the 
word on the street. For a second, my heart pounds wildly, and I am terrified 
and I am running, because the bullets are aimed at me. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is being arrested tonight? Who is keeping watch for the U.S. planes from 
an open square of concrete inside one of Haiti's prisons? That is where 
prisoners sleep, without bedding, with gutters for toilets. The prisons are 
said to be packed, though no human-rights organization has gotten inside to 
document who has been detained, beaten or tortured, which, if any, bodies have 
been dumped. 
</P>
<P>
 It is only recently that President Bill Clinton acknowledged that torture had 
become routine in Haiti. It is always in moments like this, when power is 
shifting and revenge is in the air, that massacres occur, often in rural 
prisons, out of sight of the television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if my friend Christophe is awake; whether he caught any of the 
Aristide leaflets dropped over the capital last week. At 37, Christophe has 
worked his entire adult life as a servant. He writes poorly in French, cannot 
read Creole and has little chance of a better job. Until recently, he and his 
wife shared a narrow cot with their 7-year-old son; now they have a baby girl. 
I wonder where she is sleeping. Christophe says the last three years have been 
hell -- he has no other word for it. Two centuries after Haiti's independence, 
he feels like a slave. Aristide is not God to him, but a courageous man, a man 
of faith who has not abandoned his brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti is a small country, and politics have always become personal too 
quickly. Many families are divided by politics; mine is no different. I wonder 
what my cousins and their friends, part of Haiti's ruling elite, are feeling. 
Many have taken refuge in their second homes in Miami, glued to CNN. Those 
remaining debate their options: Whether to head for the Dominican border or go 
up to their summer cottages above Port-au-Prince, with a safe and spectacular 
view of the action to come. 
</P>
<P>
 I know some are mentally replaying the tumultuous events of 1915, when, days 
before the U.S. Marines landed, the head of Haitian President Villebrun 
Guillaume Sam was paraded on a stick. Many of the elite consider themselves 
apolitical, victims of a political nightmare, vulnerable to being attacked for 
being wealthy, for being light-skinned. Now, with an invasion, they worry about 
being mistaken for Americans and getting shot by newly armed, rum-drunk Haitian 
recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all part of the elite's enduring nightmare, the one where Aristide is 
cast as a monster looking the other way as vengeful masses attack the houses 
and property of the rich and civil war breaks out. To protect them from this 
nightmare, their embattled childhood friend, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras stood up to 
Clinton and became a hero. Yet, his army is seen as corrupt, drug trafficking 
and crime have flourished and, with the embargo, the country is sinking. All 
this has left the elite feeling frightened and righteous. They, too, have 
become prey to extrajudicial violence, to bribes and threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The attitude of the elite toward a U.S. invasion is equally conflicted. Many 
have U.S. passports, bank accounts and property. They educate their children 
here, pay taxes and feel as much a part of American culture as they do Haitian. 
Though they vehemently oppose an effort to restore Aristide, they nostalgically 
recall the U.S. occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934 as a golden period of 
prosperity and order -- for those with money. 
</P>
<P>
 What about Aristide, a man I knew before he was president, when he was an 
orphanage director with children perpetually clinging to him? He is the cat 
with nine lives who has used up a few, having survived several assassination 
attempts. He rarely sleeps well, and right now, amid everything else, he is 
mourning the assassination of his mentor and close friend, Father Jean-Marie 
Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
 I worry these may be the last weeks of Aristide, a man who has changed the 
face of Haitian history. There is no doubt in my mind that his enemies will try 
to kill him if he returns. Nor do I doubt that he is intent on returning. 
Whatever his private fears, he acts like a man with a sense of destiny, someone 
for whom others have died -- loved ones like Vincent -- taking the blows and 
bullets meant for him. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard for me to imagine him back in power in a demilitarized Haiti, 
protected by an international peacekeeping force that will cede power to a 
retrained civil police force. It seems only yesterday that Cedras and the army 
betrayed Aristide in the coup d'etat . And that the Clinton Administration, 
while giving Aristide sanctuary, let CIA officials attack his character and 
motives, minimized the achievements of his government, then downplayed the 
scope of human-rights abuses in Haiti -- allowing the bravest and brightest 
democrats to be killed or chased out to sea. It is only one of a thousand 
ironies that the State Department last week finally acknowledged that 
human-rights abuses today are comparable to those of the notorious Francois 
(Papa Doc) Duvalier regime, then used this fact as ballast for an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. foreign policy toward Haiti continues to be an offshoot of our domestic 
concern about immigration and Clinton's need to appease Florida lawmakers. His 
turnabout on Aristide reflects less his concern about human rights or 
democracy, than his belated assessment that the only way to keep refugees away 
from Miami is to stop the murders in Haiti. I can understand why Aristide might 
have trouble embracing an invasion, never mind trusting Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun is almost up now, and somewhere across the river, another political 
exile, Alerte Balance, has found a haven. Like Aristide, she has become a 
symbol of survival for Haitians, especially women, whose role in this struggle 
is overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Balance was cast in the international spotlight recently, after Haitian secret 
police hacked off her arms with a machete and left her for dead at the killing 
fields of Titanyen, outside Port-au-Prince. She is alive to recount the horror 
and, in another cruel irony, she has become empowered in her new role as a 
spokeswoman for Haitian democracy. But I imagine there are moments when her 
brain cannot accept her loss of limb -- common among amputees -- and she may 
suffer from phantom pains for decades.  
</P>
<P>
 Her life and condition may be an apt metaphor for the reality facing Haiti and 
all Haitians today. No miracle -- no Aristide, no Clinton, no invasion -- can 
give back what has been lost. But there is still hope for recovery, and a need 
for assistance. Healing will take place amid fresh memories of loss and 
lingering pain.

THE WAY CLEARED FOR A PENTECOSTAL PROPHET TO RULE GUATEMALA AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Victor Perera, Victor Perera, who teaches journalism in the Graduate School 
of UC Berkeley, is author of Unfinished Conquest: The Guatemalan Tragedy 
(California) and Rites: A Guatemalan Boyhood, due out next month from Mercury 
House. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Ramiro de Leon Carpio's interim two-year presidency limps to a close in 
Guatemala, hobbled by half-completed reforms and a rising crime wave he is 
powerless to stop, a familiar specter has surged from the religious right to 
fill the political vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 14, the Guatemalan Republican Front, the new political party led by 
evangelical preacher and former President Efrain Rios Montt, won 32 of the 80 
seats in the reduced "reform congress," which replaces a corruption-riddled 
legislative body abolished by Carpio last year. This interim congress was 
called by popular referendum to restart stalled peace negotiations with leftist 
guerrillas and steer Guatemala through its tortuous transition to postwar 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Rios Montt's stunning victory, his two leading opponents, the 
moderate Christian Democrats and the right-of-center National Action Party, 
which garnered 32 seats between them, at first endorsed the self-proclaimed 
prophet for president of the new congress. The die was cast, and the presidency 
Rios Montt gained in a palace coup in 1982, and lost in another coup 18 months 
later, appeared ripe for the taking. Everyone in Guatemala knows that Rios 
Montt, whose presidential bid is impeded by a constitutional restraint against 
former chiefs of state, would win a popular vote hands down over all other 
aspirants. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, when Brig. Gen. Efrain Rios Montt was robbed of his rightful election 
victory by former President Carlos Arana Osorio, he fled to California and 
joined forces with evangelical crusader and recovering alcoholic Jim Durkin, 
who headed the Eureka-based Gospel Outreach fundamentalist movement. To Durkin 
and his followers today, the ascendancy of Rios Montt provides a golden 
opportunity to propagate their teachings and convert Guatemala into the first 
Latin American country with a Protestant majority by the end of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios Montt was reborn from the ashes of defeat and exile, and returned to 
seize power in the '82 palace coup orchestrated by junior military officers and 
his "gringo" evangelical cronies, co-founders of the Church of the Word ( el 
Verbo ), a Guatemala-based offshoot of Gospel Outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 During his abbreviated tenure, Rios Montt preached the word of God on 
television while publicly executing accused communists and common criminals; in 
the Highlands, his army mounted a bloody counterinsurgency, named "Bullets and 
Beans," against insurgents of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union, who 
had recruited thousands of impoverished Mayan Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Rios Montt was overthrown by Gen. Humberto Mejia Victores in 
August, 1983, he had left an indelible mark on his countrymen: His 
scorched-earth policy had wiped out hundreds of Mayan villages, creating a 
million refugees and leaving 15,000 Guatemalans dead or disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 The former catechist who had cleaned toilets in Catholic Maryknoll missions 
defied Pope John Paul II during his pastoral visit to Guatemala by ignoring his 
pleas for clemency and executing three convicts tried and sentenced in his 
notorious kangaroo courts. 
</P>
<P>
 What Rios Montt's ladino and Mayan supporters remember with undying 
admiration, however, is that he imposed order in the countryside and stamped 
out political and delinquent crime in the cities and larger towns. It is this 
achievement that the country's tiny electorate -- barely 731,000 out of 3.5 
million eligible voters -- commemorated with their ballots on Aug. 14. To Rios 
Montt and his right-wing allies, the absenteeism of 80% of Guatemala's voters 
was a blessing, and a resounding slap in the face of democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters' revulsion is understandable, as delinquency and political crime 
have touched nearly every household in the capital and in outlying villages, 
and eroded Guatemala's fledging democracy; the rot was most flagrant in the 
abolished congress and the courts, where mid-level bureaucrats enriched 
themselves with graft and extortion, even as congressmen and supreme-court 
judges raked in millions in contraband. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, after years of fruitless negotiations, the military and the 
guerrillas finally agreed on a United Nations-sponsored truth commission to 
gather evidence and assign culpability for the estimated 120,000 Guatemalans 
killed or disappeared, and more than a million refugees created, in the 
34-year-long civil war. Nearly 300 civilian and military observers will begin 
the task of seeking out survivors and interviewing former combatants in 
guerrilla encampments and military garrisons. Ignoring anonymous death threats, 
courageous forensic crews have continued their digging in clandestine 
cemeteries to collect evidence of atrocities by both sides in Guatemala's Zones 
of Conflict in the Highlands and the Peten. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the elections, the shadow of Rios Montt threatens to eclipse 
the years of thankless labor by human-rights monitors and mediators in the 
stalled peace talks between the government and the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, as during the 13-year reign of "benevolent dictator" Jorge Ubico 
in the '30s and '40s, who is remembered for executing common criminals 
side-by-side with his political opponents, Guatemalans apparently long to have 
their "human rights" enforced by a charismatic caudillo with a velvet-lined 
iron fist. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as expected, Rios Montt eventually presides over the new congress and 
chooses 13 judges for the new supreme court, he will be in a position to 
override the constitutional clause that prevents his running for office. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, his former counselors in Eureka and U.S. evangelicals with dozens of 
Pentecostal and fundamentalist sects, who have overrun Guatemala since the 
outbreak of the civil war, are keeping a low profile, scrupulously avoiding the 
blatant intervention that helped bring down their candidate in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new congress convened this past week, the opposition parties joined 
forces to block Rios Montt and named to the presidency of congress a member of 
the National Action Party, Anabela Comparini. 
</P>
<P>
 But the former general's evangelical supporters remain confident that this 
temporary roadblock will not deter their anointed from his ultimate objective, 
and Rios Montt will be seated in the presidential chair to welcome the Second 
Coming of Christ at the end of the millennium. This time around, the 
iron-fisted caudillo will also wear the mantle of the messianic prophet.

IS BILL CLINTON'S LASTING POLITICAL LEGACY GOING TO BE THE RESURRECTION OF THE 
GOP? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Overemphasis on President Bill Clinton's individual failures -- in health 
reform, foreign policy and moral leadership -- clouds our understanding of what 
could be his most significant 1993-94 political impact: the extraordinary 
rebuilding of the Republican Party and the serious dislocation of U.S. 
liberalism. Barring a surprise in Haiti, Clinton is doing for liberalism what 
Jim Jones did for Kool-Aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The political reversal has been stunning since George Bush left office in 
January, 1993, after getting just 37.5% of setback the vote -- the lowest for 
any Republican President since 1912. Earlier, Bush's job approval had set 
another modern record by plummeting 60 points in 15 months -- from 90% in 
March, 1991, after the Gulf War, to just 30% in midsummer, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the GOP is storming back, with a string of 1993-94 off-year and 
special-election victories unprecedented for the party out of power, and the 
prospect of operational, and perhaps official, control of the U.S. House and 
Senate. If Republicans make even a modest version of the November gains 
predicted, Clinton will confront the largest number of congressional 
Republicans to face a Democratic President since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 This may not be altogether bad for the President, but it is bleak news for the 
U.S. liberal agenda, which faces a Siberian winter for the next year or two. 
What's remarkable, though, is how the Democrats are following the same 
counterproductive political-sitcom script they've followed most of the last 
half century: Elect a President from a border state or the South with a taste 
for cronyism, frequently with a brother out of a L'il Abner cartoon, a tendency 
toward ideological compromise and military ineptitude, a manner that grates on 
many voters and a diplomatic style that produces snickers in the global 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry S. Truman of Missouri, President from 1945 to 1952, begins the list. The 
roster should also include Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas and his brother, Sam 
Houston Johnson; Jimmy Carter of Georgia with his brother, Billy, and now 
Clinton of Arkansas with his brother, Roger. During these presidencies, the 
holiday White House has shifted to centers of gravitas like Johnson City, 
Texas; Plains, Ga., and Hot Springs, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Scandals and conflicts of interest have been epidemic since Truman's term, 
usually involving mink coats, 5% rake-offs, deep freezes, family broadcasting 
stations, peanut deals, country banks, commodity straddles and good ol' boy law 
firms. Truman, Johnson and Carter all botched wars or military actions -- the 
Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Iranian hostage crisis with its failed U.S. 
rescue attempt. Because voters were unimpressed, all three faced strong 
renomination challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the unfortunate regional and philosophic tradition from which the 
Democratic Party chose Clinton in 1992, but the latter so far has surpassed his 
predecessors. After his first 100 days, he had the lowest ratings of any newly 
elected chief executive since the invention of polling in the 1930s. His 
current ratings are near the lows for this point in a presidency; and he is the 
first Oval Office occupant to generate major scandals and lose the trust of the 
American people even before the first midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has reduced the public's faith in Washington below the levels achieved 
by Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Carter and Bush. Moreover, Haiti has the 
potential to be a historic first: the first invasion ordered over the 
opposition of much of the public -- 73% -- by the first President accused of 
being a draft dodger. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous military miscarriages in Korea, Vietnam and Iran were all 
damaging to the Democratic Party, but were all ordered by Presidents who had 
themselves served as military officers. Compared with Clinton, a cynic could 
say that Truman, Johnson and Carter were Dwight D. Eisenhower, Douglas A. 
MacArthur and George S. Patton Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 So is all this about to be held against the Democratic Party? Probably. At 
least that's what the polls and the special elections of the last 20 months 
seem to suggest. In fact, Clinton's three border state-Southern predecessors 
did much the same thing. Truman's unpopularity enabled the GOP to sweep the 
1952 elections; Johnson's multiple foul-ups allowed the GOP to resurrect itself 
from the 1964 Barry M. Goldwater disaster and elect Nixon in 1968. And national 
dissatisfaction with Carter paved the way for the stunning victory of Ronald 
Reagan in 1980, just six years after Nixon was forced to resign after 
Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the resurrection of the GOP achieved by Clinton isn't unprecedented. 
What is unusual, though, is the breadth and speed of the process. If Carter was 
a case of Geritol for the GOP of 1980, the Clinton Administration has been the 
equivalent of Ponce de Leon's fountain of youth. No one is praising the great 
sagacity, talent pool and leadership of the Republican Party -- if the 
Vegetarians were the sole party on the ballot opposing Clinton, they'd probably 
be winning, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the second half of the American political dilemma. The 
Republicans can be resurrected, but they can't gain the lasting trust of the 
people. The Truman, Johnson and Carter failures produced the two- and 
three-term regimes of Eisenhower, Nixon-Gerald R. Ford and Reagan-Bush, but 
none of these could please the public enough to give the GOP a top-to-bottom 
national political supremacy. On the contrary, by 1992, when the GOP had held 
the White House for 20 out of the last 24 years, the party's share of the 
presidential vote plummeted 16 points from its previous level in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, that magnitude of decline has signaled a watershed and movement 
into a new era -- as it did in 1932 and 1968. The point is that conservatives 
who believe Clinton's failure was inevitable and that the GOP era is simply 
being renewed may be fooling themselves, like the Democrats did after Nixon 
resigned in 1974 and Carter won in 1976. Democrats generally assumed that they 
were back, that the Nixon years were a fluke and liberalism could resurrect its 
old rhetoric and blueprints. Carter's defeat in 1980 proved the new era was 
real. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Republicans make major gains in November, as appears likely, they may 
make the same error. They may mistake Clinton's personal failure as a mandate 
for a return to an ideology of domestic inaction and drift that the public 
rejected under Bush -- and that also helped cut short previous GOP regimes. 
This kind of GOP record in Congress over the next two years could give Clinton 
just the 1996 whipping boy he needs. If the Democratic Party of the last 
half-century has continued to bounce along in a rut, arguably that is almost as 
true of the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come to face a basic truth. Disgusted American voters aren't 
merely tired of Clinton and the Democratic Party. They're angry at Washington 
and its entrenched political classes, they're sick of the two-party duopoly and 
there's some evidence that they're also radicalizing toward support for a major 
overhaul of the U.S. political system. Wouldn't it be ironic if this larger 
upheaval was the ultimate political consequence of the Clinton Administration?

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; ROBERT ROTBERG; CAN ORDER COME TO HAITI AFTER TWO 
CENTURIES OF CHAOS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt is a producer for Fox News and a contributor 
to National Public Radio's All Things Considered and Morning Edition. He spoke 
with Robert Rotberg from the historian's home in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On July 28, 1915, a force of 330 U.S. Marines invaded Port-au-Prince, Haiti. 
Their stated aim -- to bring stability to a country in chaos. They met little 
resistance and quickly secured the capital. The only casualties were two 
Marines killed by friendly fire. While few Americans may be aware of this event 
in our history, even the poorest Haitian knows most of the details. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines stayed for 19 years. They built a few roads, strung a few power 
and telephone lines and installed a series of puppet governments. Yet, they did 
almost nothing to develop the country's political, social and economic 
potential. Haiti remained the basket case of the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 A far more formidable U.S. force now stands ready to return to Haiti, though 
it's doubtful they'll meet much more opposition than did their 
great-grandfathers. And the Haiti they will find is not much different from the 
country of 1915 -- still the poorest country in the hemisphere, overpopulated, 
undereducated and fully disorganized. 
</P>
<P>
 The onetime French colony won its independence in 1804, when former slave 
Toussaint L'Ouverture led a rebellion against the French planters. It would be 
almost two centuries before Haitians could choose their own leader in a 
democratic election. In 1989, 70% of Haitian voters cast their ballot for a 
40-year-old Catholic priest and proponent of liberation theology, Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. Aristide's Marxist rhetoric -- "capitalism is poison" -- upset the 
Haitian elite, along with many in the United States. Only nine months after 
taking office, Aristide was ousted in a coup organized by the man he'd chosen 
to head Haiti's military, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since the coup, Haiti has endured a U.N.-sponsored embargo. 
Aristide has rejected several attempts at a compromise that could have 
installed a new government. Meanwhile, reports from Haiti tell of murder, rape 
and atrocity, and thousands of Haitian boat people have risked their lives to 
flee their country. With President Bill Clinton committed to restoring the 
Aristide government at gunpoint, the question now becomes: Can Haiti -- mired 
in two centuries of indigence and neglect -- be saved? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rotberg isn't sure, but he's convinced we must try. The president of 
the Cambridge, Mass.-based World Peace Foundation and a professor at Harvard 
University's Kennedy School of Government, Rotberg, 59, is author of "Haiti: 
The Politics of Squalor." Just after Clinton presented his Oval Office speech 
to the nation Thursday, Rotberg discussed the troubled history of Haiti and his 
hopes for the most downtrodden nation in the New World. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Let's start in the 18th Century -- what was going on in Haiti under 
French colonialism?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: At that time, Haiti was perhaps the richest colony in the world. It 
was France's most prosperous colony and outranked any of the British colonies. 
This wealth was almost entirely based on growing sugar with slave labor. Slaves 
began to arrive in Haiti in the 16th Century and by the middle of the 18th 
Century, Haiti was producing more sugar than any place in the world, and had a 
pretty good coffee crop as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What precipitated the revolution in 1803, and how violent -- how bloody -- 
a revolution was it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That revolution actually began a few years before, brought on primarily by 
the French Revolution -- if France could get rid of kings, then shouldn't a 
French colony be able to get rid of France? The revolt was led primarily by 
recently enslaved Africans; some had hardly been in Haiti for more than a year 
or two. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a very bloody and violent overthrow. The slaves were very badly treated 
-- sugar cane is very hard to harvest, and the French planters were 
particularly cruel. So the revolution was the natural result of the bad 
treatment, along with the liberating philosophy of the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it fair to say that Haiti never totally made the transition from colony 
to nation?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes; in Haiti, the revolution was aimed at throwing out the colonial powers 
and not at building a nation. There was the continuing threat of reinvasion by 
the French. The result was a series of governments which were, in many ways, as 
autocratic as the colonial rulers they replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 From the time of the revolution, well into the 20th Century, Haiti has 
remained a country in a state of perpetual emergency. What happened was that 
the entire agricultural basis of the country was altered by the revolution and 
its aftermath. The majority of the inhabitants were no longer willing to 
cultivate sugar or coffee. Instead, they grew food crops for their own 
consumption, and the economy of Haiti became one of subsistence. That may be 
fine, but it didn't contribute to any kind of funds that would develop the 
country as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What were the events leading up to the U.S. invasion in 1915?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The country had been persisting in instability, living off coffee that was 
mostly grown wild. The people in the rural areas simply went about their 
business of subsistence, and the people in the cities plundered the countryside 
and installed presidents. Between 1908 and 1915, there were seven presidents 
and about 20 uprisings and insurrections. The government had run out of money 
and was borrowing from anyone who would lend it money -- including the First 
National City Bank of New York. When a newly installed president was literally 
torn limb from limb by a mob in Port-au-Prince, the U.S. Marines used the 
opportunity to invade the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was President Woodrow Wilson's stated reason for the invasion, and 
what was popular feeling about it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There were three unstated reasons. The First National City Bank had 
funneled millions of dollars into Haiti and it wasn't getting its loans paid 
back. Then there was a worry during World War I that the Germans might come in 
and colonize Haiti -- which would threaten the Windward Passage and the Panama 
Canal. Finally, the U.S. was protecting its market. The U.S. supplied about 60% 
of Haiti's imports. That was only about 2% of U.S. exports, but there were some 
American companies who cared a great deal about what was going on in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as public opinion, I'm not sure there was much popular debate about the 
subject. The U.S. was very busy enforcing the Monroe Doctrine during that time 
-- there were troops in plenty of other places as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's stated reason for the invasion was that intervention in the affairs 
of smaller countries represented a legitimate exercise of American power, 
because the aims of the intervention were demonstrably progressive. Wilson 
wanted to improve Haiti, and his motives were the usual Wilsonian mixture of 
doing good and also being strategic. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the parallels and the differences between 1915 and now, vis-a-vis 
the relationship of Haiti and the U.S.?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Now, we are about to invade to reinstall a democratically elected president 
-- the only democratically elected president Haiti has ever known -- and we 
would do it to return democracy to Haiti. In 1915, we were not interested in 
promoting internal democracy. We did not enter on behalf of an elected Haitian 
government, as in today's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we occupied the country for almost two decades, we didn't train a 
civil service, didn't improve agriculture and didn't develop a political 
culture which could outlast the American occupation. In fact, the Marine 
occupation simply prepared Haiti for a renewal of dictatorship and instability. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did the occupation engender a lasting anti-American feeling among Haitians? 
 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I think that is often overdrawn. Certainly, the occupation was never 
popular in Haiti, and because the Marines did little to improve the country, 
Haitians were glad to see them leave. But the upcoming invasion will be popular 
and the Marines will get a warm welcome this time. We will be pushing out a 
vicious junta which is much opposed by the mass of Haitians. That was not the 
case in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 The only opposition to the current invasion will come from the commercial 
elite in Haiti. Everybody who's not profiting from the situation right now will 
welcome the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Many people consider Aristide a Marxist and would term him anti-American. 
He's certainly proved to be inflexible in many ways. Is there any irony in this 
government using its considerable force to reinstall into office a man so vocal 
in his condemnation of our country?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Before he was elected in 1990, Aristide was very anti-American. I think he 
had very little experience in politics and in government. I believe that 
anti-Americanism quickly gave way to a more realistic appraisal of who were his 
friends and who were his enemies and how he could best govern Haiti. Since he's 
been ousted, some of his strongest supporters have been Americans. I think he's 
aware of that, and will continue to be aware of that when he resumes office. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will he be able to maintain control, and if so, will he step down and allow 
an election in 1996, as President Clinton outlined in his speech?  
</P>
<P>
 A: He has said that he will not stand in that election as a candidate. Perhaps 
he will go back on that and run if the people demand it. But I believe there 
will be elections in 1996, as President Clinton promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Aristide run the country? No, not without substantial help from the United 
States, Canada and other countries, and not without a 10-year period of 
systematic assistance and training for all parts of the government, the 
military and so on. The amount of money this will cost is relatively small. 
Haiti is the size of Maryland and is, by far, the poorest country in the 
hemisphere -- a little goes a long way in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does Haiti hold any strategic value for this country?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, if by strategic value you mean it's geographically or militarily 
strategic. It has no oil or precious resources. Why Haiti is important to our 
self-interest is that it represents the denial of democracy to the people of a 
country who fought very hard for it, elected a president and had it taken away. 
Democracy in this hemisphere is a precious commodity. The more we can maintain 
democracy in small countries, the better it is for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your prescription for Haiti?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the invasion should be over within a matter of hours or days. Then 
there's just some mopping up. Bring all but 1,000 troops home after a week. 
There's not going to be much of a guerrilla response -- 1,000 troops will be 
enough to ensure stability. There's no popular support for any anti-Aristide 
uprising. President Aristide would have to be protected for a time, but I think 
a new army could be trained to put down any civil insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the easy part. The hard part is developing a political culture in Haiti 
and jump-starting the economy, which has been destroyed -- what little there 
was -- by the embargo. And providing some level of hope, security, health and 
education for the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans are probably not aware that in a country only 650 miles from 
Miami, less than 15% of the population can read. We should not be proud of that 
at the end of the 20th Century. So my prescription would call for 10 years of 
retraining -- we need Americans, Canadians and others who speak French to train 
people so they can reinvigorate their country. It will be a long, tough slog -- 
I don't want to minimize that -- but for Haiti it is the last best chance we 
have. 
</P>
<P>
 Our job is not to do everything for the Haitians -- that was what was wrong 
with the Marine occupation. Our job is to build capacity in Haiti so that they 
can do it themselves. And the fortunate thing is that -- unlike in 1915 and 
unlike in 1971, when longtime dictator Papa Doc Duvalier died -- there are now 
thousands of Haitians living in this country who are anxious to go back to 
Haiti and help their country. They represent its greatest resource. These 
people have skills and are trained, and if only a small portion return home, 
they are Haiti's best hope.

CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; FINDING A 'SAFE PLACE' ON CAMPUS FOR STUDENT VICTIMS OF 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rachael Perry, Rachael Perry is editor in chief of The State News, the MSU 
campus newspaper. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When darkness begins to envelop Michigan State University, students, 
especially women, are advised not to walk alone. In an attempt to deter 
criminals and increase safety, police patrol the grounds on foot, extra lights 
illuminate sidewalks winding between trees and ivy-covered buildings and more 
telephones are available for emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
 But once students arrive safely in their dormitories, apartments or houses, no 
one can protect them from a silence shattered by shouts, tears and fists. 
</P>
<P>
 MSU Safe Place, one of the first on-campus shelters in the country, offers 
hope for faculty, staff and students who are victims of domestic violence. It 
provides a place to sleep, clothing, cooking facilities and day-to-day 
equipment that abuse victims need. Victims are welcome to stay for five days, 
then may be referred to other housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe Place was the brainchild of MSU President M. Peter McPherson's wife, 
Joanne, who has long been interested in the issue of domestic violence. The 
next phase of the project is to let women know the shelter exists and, at the 
same time, keep the location a secret. Currently, women must be referred to the 
shelter either by campus police or by an outside counselor on domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 When Safe Place was first established this summer, cynics questioned the need 
for a shelter that helped women and men who are mostly young and single. But 
campus police never doubted the need. They believe domestic violence 
represented 15% of the 181 assaults reported on campus last year. Before Safe 
Place, victims at MSU had one shelter to go to -- the only one in the county. 
And it had to turn away about 200 people last year. 
</P>
<P>
 No one wants to believe that the shrill voices and crashes next door amount to 
more than an isolated argument. No one wants to accept that one of three women 
murdered in the United States is killed by a husband or boyfriend. No mother, 
father, sister, brother or friend wants to face up to these numbers: 
</P>
<P>
 Between 25% and 50% of women involved in intimate relationships with men will 
be physically abused at least once. An average of 28% of high school and 
college students are assaulted by someone they are dating, potentially the most 
accurate indicator of future abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, domestic abuse is an unmentionable. Statistics, even the most 
hard-hitting ones, are alienating. It took the violent death of a former wife 
of a superstar athlete to bring an old issue to the forefront of the country's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But who else has to die before serious remedies and punishments are proposed? 
I refuse to be grateful that Nicole Brown Simpson had to be martyred for the 
sake of public awareness, when an untold amount of people suffer from abuse 
every year, with many dying as a result of their injuries. Must a person die or 
be killed for every law, every restraining order, every piece of support, every 
shelter, every prosecution? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, that is already happening. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take so much more than faceless numbers and media preaching and 
intermittent cater-to-public lawmaking. Individual efforts are commendable, and 
volunteers can make small differences, but domestic violence is a monster. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismantling stereotypes and fostering awareness is the beginning. Educating 
students and abusers, potential and actual, as Safe Place will do, is another 
step. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, victims need to realize that domestic abuse is wrong. True, it 
is taken more seriously today than before, but that is not a drastic 
improvement. Thirty years ago, spousal abuse was not specifically outlawed. The 
public perception of domestic violence and its victims needs to shift 
responsibility away from the abused and onto the abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 Battling violence with shelters, education and support for people of every 
race, age and gender will help unlock the confines of abusive homes and 
preserve safety, self-respect and dignity.

FILM OFFICE MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those of us who have the privilege of serving Los Angeles as appointed 
representatives of Mayor Richard Riordan, it is our job to initiate policies to 
make city government function better for everyone.  
</P>
<P>
 That's why I wholeheartedly agree with your editorial ("Keeping a Hometown 
Industry Home," Sept. 9), joining with the mayor and the L.A. County Board of 
Supervisors in urging the Los Angeles City Council's approval of a merger of 
the city and county film permitting offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Location filming often crosses jurisdictional boundaries. One-stop permit 
shopping for the film industry would be as helpful to it as one-stop permitting 
would be for builders, manufacturers and other job creators in our city. 
Streamlining these oversight operations should be a goal of government at all 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 It was with this goal in mind that the L.A. City Fire Department, through the 
mayor's urgings and our commission's direction, and in collaboration with the 
film industry, devised a new and innovative "spot check" safety program to 
replace the city's filming oversight program in place for the past 60 years. We 
currently require a fire safety officer to be present around the clock at 
virtually all filming locations in the city.  
</P>
<P>
 Our new program will provide for periodic inspections at locations where the 
public is not present in meaningful numbers or where there are no open flames 
or pyrotechnics used. This innovative program will substantially reduce the 
film industry's location costs (the industry pays for fire oversight) while 
still preserving public safety.

QUAYLE ON VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our country has not changed much in the past 200 years. Dan Quayle reinforces 
my belief ("Quayle Calls on Fathers to be Responsible," Sept. 9).As an American 
studies student, I am overwhelmed with historical concepts, facts and figures. 
In Kennebec County, Me., between 1785-1797, 38% of infants were conceived out 
of wedlock. I doubt that Quayle will solve a social dilemma that has been going 
on for over 200 years by eliminating welfare benefits to women who bear 
children out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Census Bureau reports that only 50.8% of American children live in 
"traditional" families (Aug. 30). Quayle continues to bash non-traditional 
families. I know that Quayle does not spell too well, but doesn't he read?

 Re "Clinton Assails Out-of-Wedlock Births," Sept. 10: Current polls say 
Americans are concerned about family values, so the President, of all people, 
lectures Baptists on morality. His obvious strategy: Tell people what they want 
to hear, whether you believe in it or not, and you will get their votes.

BILINGUAL EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "How Do You Say 'Catch-22' in Spanish?" Commentary, Sept. 5: 
</P>
<P>
 As a bilingual teacher, I am constantly frustrated by fellow teachers who do 
not understand bilingual education and are constantly undermining the program. 
Unfortunately, opinions such as those stated by Douglas Lasken feed into a 
misunderstanding of bilingual education by the general public and erode support 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasken referred to a child who had "taught" herself to read in English and was 
being held back by having to continue in a bilingual program. The point that 
Lasken missed, along with many monolingual teachers, is the fact that children 
who have been taught to read in Spanish and have a strong foundation in that 
language easily transition to English reading. The reason she could read in 
English was because she was first taught to read in Spanish. She did not really 
teach herself to read as Lasken seems to believe. He also pointed out that this 
child had already read the material in Spanish but he was assuming that her 
comprehension was after reading it in English. 
</P>
<P>
 If we applied some of these opinions that teachers hold about bilingual 
education to ourselves, such as expecting ourselves to function well in Spanish 
after only two or three years, we would have a greater appreciation of the 
program and the wonderful progress that our students are making.

<P>
 Lasken's firsthand commentary on the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
Bilingual Master Plan and its evolution from the 1974 Lau decision was 
outstanding and revealing. What we are doing is hiding the English language 
from thousands of non-English speaking children, the very ones who need it the 
most.  
</P>
<P>
 While bilingual education in some forms may be beneficial, the LAUSD plan is 
counterproductive and delays integration into our culture by years.  
</P>
<P>
 Is there any education benefit from the LAUSD bilingual education program? I 
beg to be enlightened. Has data ever been interpreted by someone not involved 
in bilingual education that shows that it is educationally beneficial? How many 
of our federal and state tax dollars are funneled into LAUSD to support 
bilingual education?  
</P>
<P>
 LAUSD is functioning true to form and putting the three Rs and the education 
of our children way down the priority list. Those running the bilingual 
education program are winning. Lasken, his student Irena and America are 
losing.

<P>
 I hope that my professional colleague Lasken does not snatch defeat from the 
jaws of victory. His student Irena learned to read in her first language, and 
now has found it so easy to transfer that skill to English that she has managed 
to do so without formal instruction. That kind of transfer and motivation is 
exactly the effect that bilingual instruction is supposed to have. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact time to transition to English is something of an art, and it may 
well be the LAUSD is being unreasonably stringent. I have argued in the past 
that transition should be relatively early (and much more gradual). But I worry 
that some readers may conclude from Lasken's essay that the primary language 
instruction was superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask those readers to compare Irena with Carlos, who comes to me late in the 
fourth grade. He doesn't know how to read. He guesses at words; his guesses are 
wildly improbable. A look at the records reveals that Carlos (yes, I changed 
the name), from a Spanish-speaking home, was placed in English reading in first 
grade by a district not far from here. Four years later we have a kid who can't 
read any language. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with delayed transition, Irena's prognosis is favorable. She is gaining 
further reading skills in her primary language, which will hopefully transfer 
to English. Not so Carlos, who has now moved and will likely leave some other 
teacher wondering how a kid can spend four years in school and not be able to 
read.

NEEDLE EXCHANGE FOR DRUG USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Riordan Declares AIDS Emergency in L.A.," Sept. 7: 
</P>
<P>
 As a physician who cares for youth infected with HIV and chairman of the 
Adolescent HIV Consortium (a coalition of over 80 community youth service 
agencies in Los Angeles County), I would like to applaud the leadership of 
Mayor Richard Riordan, Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg as well as the rest of the 
City Council. Their support for needle exchange demonstrates their willingness 
to act quickly in a crisis to ensure better health for our community.  
</P>
<P>
 AIDS is continuing to spread rapidly to youth. Approximately 20% of my youth 
infected with HIV have histories of sharing needles. One-third of the homeless 
youth I provide care to also report injecting drugs. Many of these youth 
express an unwillingness to begin drug treatment but readily accept the usage 
of clean needles. The Clean Needles Now program in Hollywood has undoubtedly 
saved lives by providing clean needles to my patients. In addition, they 
frequently refer youth to my clinics for HIV testing, medical and psychosocial 
services. This facilitates the provision of HIV-prevention education as well as 
drug treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The need to expand needle exchange to other areas of Los Angeles is still 
critical. Public education needs to be expanded to these communities to 
reassure the public that research has conclusively demonstrated that needle 
exchange does not promote the increased usage of drugs. MARVIN BELZER MD

</P>
<P>
 * Mayor Riordan's declaration of an emergency to prevent the police from 
issuing citations for the illegal needle exchange program is irrational and 
destructive.  
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing to stop the needles handed out from becoming contaminated and 
shared like those they replace. Since the life expectancy of an IV drug abuser 
is half that of a person infected with HIV, supporters of such programs cannot 
claim to be saving lives. In fact, they are enabling addiction. Only the dope 
lords and social workers benefit from needle handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie Williams should reject this monstrous idea and protect our 
citizens, including those addicted to drugs, from its harmful consequences.

DON'T WAFFLE NOW ON GATT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States played a crucial leadership role in bringing about the 
successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of world talks to liberalize trade. 
Now comes ratification. Many of our trading partners are waiting anxiously to 
see whether Congress, which has displayed unusual nonpartisanship when it comes 
to trade, will approve the necessary legislation in its current session to 
implement the new accord by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no time for waffling in Washington. If the United States delays in 
approving the new GATT agreement, other nations might postpone their own votes. 
That would undercut confidence in free trade just as the economies of Europe 
and Japan are beginning to show signs of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 To expedite a congressional vote, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said 
the Administration would drop the fast-track authorization it had tacked on to 
the GATT implementing legislation. President Clinton was seeking fast-track 
capability for future trade agreements. The authority, which last was extended 
to the Uruguay Round, allows a President to negotiate trade accords that are 
subject to a simple yes-or-no vote by Congress, with no amendments.  
</P>
<P>
 The Administration now is offering to take up its fast-track request 
separately, after the GATT legislation is approved. The risk, of course, is 
that it may not be easy to resurrect fast track in a new Congress after the 
November election. But if fast track remains in the GATT bill, it poses an easy 
out for those in Congress who are reluctant, for other reasons, to support 
GATT. 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress does not approve the GATT accord, U.S. exports, including those 
from California, might decline because of continuing tariff and non-tariff 
barriers. A Bank of America report forecast an immediate loss of 173,000 jobs 
in California, growing to a loss of 252,000 jobs by the year 2000. The outlook 
would be far rosier with a new GATT agreement in place. California and the 
nation both would benefit.

PROP. 190 -- A NEEDED LIGHT; MEASURE WOULD LIFT SECRECY FROM JUDGES' 
DISCIPLINARY HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Commission on Judicial Performance wants San Diego County Superior 
Court Judge G. Dennis Adams removed from office by the California Supreme Court 
for what it calls willful misconduct that has brought the judicial office into 
disrepute. Specifically the commission found that Adams failed to disclose that 
he accepted gifts from litigants, that he failed to recuse himself from cases 
involving law firms that had given him gifts and that he gave misleading 
answers to questions from the commission.Adams, while expressing regret for 
some past actions, says he doesn't think his conduct warrants removal from 
office. That's something the Supreme Court will now decide. 
</P>
<P>
 What voters will be asked to decide in November is whether there should be a 
change in the peculiar and grievously flawed practice that now allows 
proceedings against a judge to be secret. Allegations against Adams were heard 
over 17 days last November by a special panel of three judges, in closed 
hearings as usual. The panel's recommendations went to the eight-member 
commission in late April, again without public knowledge. The commission 
considered arguments from Adams' lawyers and rejected the special panel's 
finding that Adams' conduct had been simply negligent, once more in secret 
proceedings. This is not the way public business in an open society should be 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature agrees. With only a single dissent, both houses have approved 
a constitutional measure requiring that, once formal charges have been filed 
against a judge, all papers and proceedings in the case must be open to the 
public. The aim is to remove from disciplinary proceedings the coziness that 
secrecy encourages; confidentiality is one thing, possible cover-up is 
something else. The constitutional amendment will appear on the November ballot 
as Proposition 190. We strongly recommend its passage.

SCIENCE MEETS THE PRESS: CAN MEDIA BE TRUSTED?; QUEST FOR BETTER 'GATEKEEPING' 
IN COVERING COMPLEX ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as do judges and trial lawyers, the news media have a difficult time 
digesting and interpreting scientific and medical findings. What is the public 
to make of contradictory reports on the alleged health hazards of pesticides, 
silicone breast implants, electromagnetic fields, radiation, caffeine or global 
warming? 
</P>
<P>
 In a series last week, David Shaw of The Times argued that the press has often 
distorted news on such hazards, focusing on the most headline-grabbing reports 
and raising, for example, unwarranted fears about dioxin and other toxins. In 
the same week the Environmental Protection Agency reaffirmed its earlier 
conclusions that dioxin is a probable human carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
 Given how powerfully, and often irrevocably, press reports influence public 
opinion, behavior and policy, it is worth examining how good science and good 
reporting can better fit together. It is no surprise that the press sometimes 
exaggerates the dramatic and oversimplifies the complex. The larger question is 
how this can be changed, and to what extent grant-hungry scientists themselves 
are accomplices in the hype crimes they deplore. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw argues that fear and hysteria over environmental health risks have 
escalated in recent years even though such indicators as life expectancy, 
infant mortality and most cancer rates are significantly better. But it can be 
argued equally that one reason public health has improved is that the press has 
done an excellent job in spreading the word about the benefits of exercise, 
good diet and buckling up seat belts, as well as the risks of smoking and 
illicit drug use. And there was even a handful of reporters who wrote on the 
problem of the O-rings before those seals caused the explosion of the space 
shuttle in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, it must also be recognized that sometimes science and medical 
reporting is less skeptical than other kinds of journalism. Eager for 
attention, perhaps even awed by their expert sources, some science reporters 
tend not to give the same scrutiny to major scientific developments that, say, 
veteran political reporters give the latest pabulum from Washington. Yet when 
political reporters took over some of the recent stories on Cold War radiation 
experiments on humans they created a hopeless mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Though deadlines, considerations of competition and lack of resources make it 
difficult, reporters must seek to winnow bad science from good. Obviously news 
organizations cannot attempt to replicate experiments, but computer databases 
and other modern resources make it easier to challenge weak data, politically 
motivated "breakthroughs" and even occasional scientific fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the extreme example of the 1989 announcement by the University of 
Utah that its scientists had achieved a breakthrough in cold fusion that 
promised a "clean, virtually inexhaustible source of energy." The scientists 
manipulated the media, garnering a gush of uncritical initial stories even 
though they had not subjected their work to peer review, published it in a 
journal or even shared it with other experts. They later complained about a 
hostile press when their work was exposed as erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson here is twofold: The press must learn to be better gatekeepers of 
the medical and scientific information it amplifies for public consumption, 
without making the gates so narrow that heretical but worthy new ideas are 
screened out. Scientists must do a better job in helping the press translate 
their important work, and in ridding their ranks of the fakes and hype artists.

CANADA WATCH; SEPARATION'S HIGH COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the recent victory in Quebec's provincial parliamentary elections of 
the separatist Parti Quebecois, a referendum on secession could well find most 
Quebecers voting for continued federation with the rest of Canada. Here's why. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada is a country on the international A-list -- one of the G-7 nations, the 
elite group of seven major industrialized powers, and a member of NATO. A 
nation that with some reason styles itself as a European state on North 
American soil, Canada has played an influential, mediating role in 
international deliberations on security and economics. Because its relations 
with Mexico are so much calmer than those of the United States, Canada has been 
particularly important as a balancing factor in post-NAFTA North America. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if Quebec secedes? Neither Quebec nor English Canada alone would be 
large enough for G-7 or NATO membership. As for NAFTA, neither Quebec nor 
English Canada could bargain from the kind of strength that federated Canada 
has enjoyed. In the end, that's why most Quebecers will choose federation. And 
that, clearly, is the outcome most Americans favor. 
</P>
<P>
 English Canadians, resentful of the special cultural treatment Quebec has 
received, occasionally drift toward a huffy "Who needs you anyway?" attitude. 
But Canada does need Quebec; and if a measure of special treatment for French 
culture is the price of continued federation, English Canadians should find the 
will to pay it. For both Canadas, the cost of accommodation will be far lower, 
in the long run, than the cost of separation.

PERSPECTIVE ON ISLAM; THE TYRANNY OF BROTHERHOOD; AUTHORITARIANISM, WHICH IS 
ENDEMIC TO MUSLIM SOCIETY, HAS PERVERTED BOTH SECULAR AND RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAHER HATHOUT and SALAM al-MARAYATI, Dr. Maher Hathout is senior adviser to 
the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles. Salam al-Marayati is its 
director. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today, Muslims in much of the world are ruled under military dictatorships, 
occupations or theocracies -- even subject to genocide -- suffering 
human-rights violations under Muslim and non-Muslim rulers. In America, Muslims 
find a place where they are free and also a place where they can work with 
others to alleviate social and political injustices. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslims in America enjoy their freedom, but until Muslim countries allow their 
citizens to think freely and write without fear of retribution, as the Sharia 
(Islamic law) mandates, let us not deceive ourselves by claiming that those 
countries are part of our dream. No, they are part of our nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem in Muslim societies is rooted in authoritarianism, which burdens 
practically every community, mosque and family. 
</P>
<P>
 The subjugation of Muslims cannot be blamed simply on Western hegemony, even 
though colonialism has debilitated many if not all Muslim countries. Muslims 
continue to suffer because of the abject failure of the religious Establishment 
to live up to the standards of human decency set by Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can Muslims' poor image in the eyes of the world be blamed on the media, 
for it is often the flagrant contributions of Muslim leaders that foster those 
negative images. When the Koran, for example, stipulates "There shall be no 
compulsion in religion" (2:256), there is no excuse for religious police 
patrolling Muslim streets. This form of repression pushes people to the margins 
of civilized society, because the voice of reason, which plays a vital role in 
Islamic jurisprudence and in opposition politics, along with the spirit of the 
Koran, is silenced -- jailed, exiled or dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversies surrounding Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasrin, as another 
example, are symptoms of a larger problem engulfing the Muslim world -- an 
erosion of Islamic ethics. The death threats levied against the two writers 
should be condemned, but the fact remains that they are by no means seeking 
positive change among Muslims or reconciliation between Islam and the West. 
Rather, they are promoting the exclusion of Islam, which is, according to 
Princeton scholar Khaled Abou Fadl, a form of "secular fundamentalism." Hence, 
Rushdie and Nasrin gain notoriety from Muslims and empathy from the Western 
Establishment. The deeper struggle, however, involves the collapse of an 
Islamic structure that rests on the Koran's principle of non-compulsion.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Muslim world is held hostage by clergy and governments that promote 
intolerance and oppose cooperation with other religious groups. Many nations 
with predominant Muslim populations exploit Islam to serve their geopolitical 
interests. Whether it is the inscription of the name of God in the Iraqi, 
Iranian or Saudi flag, or the patronizing statements by Egyptian, Libyan or 
Syrian dictators, the facades run deep in the foul stream of Middle Eastern 
politics. Virtually every country in the Muslim world violates the human rights 
of its Muslim and non-Muslim population and pretends to be the vanguard of 
Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 While Muslim governments deal with the West, openly or secretly, they often 
have their clergy instruct the people not to deal with the West. Yet the rich 
Muslim governments wield their financial influence to control Islamic movements 
worldwide, and some even have the backing of the U.S. government as 
representing "moderate" Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 These countries also incite extremists and then claim strategic value in 
defending the West against these extremists. While other citizens are defamed 
by clerics and oppressed by the government, religious radicals retain power as 
long as they do not condemn the ruler and represent a real threat. Women who 
drove through the streets of Riyadh, for example, in protest of the law banning 
them from driving, were slandered as whores by the religious Establishment. The 
duplicitous game of Middle Eastern leaders is withering, wherein they purport 
to protect the West from the fundamentalists they themselves have nurtured 
while they simultaneously escalate their rhetoric to the Muslim masses about 
Western imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
 The political structures of these countries cannot last forever because they 
are alien to their own cultures and, most important, alien to the spirit of 
Islam. Many egalitarian principles within Islam have long been shackled by 
countries that follow the lead of a strongman.  
</P>
<P>
 It is time to redefine Muslim culture based on true Islam, and perhaps a new 
beginning is in the West. Then, the public could understand how Islam is 
concerned with secular affairs and balances the concerns of this world with 
concerns of the hereafter, the temporal with the eternal; how reason is also a 
cornerstone of Islamic jurisprudence; and how the will of the people is 
inseparable from the will of God. 
</P>
<P>
 One can practice Islam in America without worrying about secret police 
dragging people out of bed in the middle of the night. Women can pray and 
lecture in American mosques rather than suffer exclusion from society. In 
America, one can criticize the government and feel patriotic. It is not an 
issue of being anti-secular or anti-religion, but of being anti-oppression and 
anti-exploitation. It would be beneficial for people to start thinking in those 
terms in order to promote justice without bias.

 After weeks of begging Fidel Castro not to let his people go, the Clinton 
Administration has gotten its way. The Cuban government has agreed to stop 
balseros from taking to the seas in search of freedom and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than 30,000 Cuban refugees remain behind barbed wire at Guantanamo 
Bay. And there is no guarantee that the rafters will stop coming. Cubans have 
been fleeing the island for 30 years, with or without Castro's permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy of the Administration's policy and of the ideologies that drive 
it are increasingly apparent. The Administration has built at Guantanamo the 
perfect monument to the linked ideas of welfare-statism and anti-immigrant 
nationalism. It has seized people with family support networks in the United 
States, people with tremendous courage and initiative and -- based on the 
record of earlier Cuban refugees -- a high likelihood of self-reliance and low 
chance of welfare dependency. And it has imprisoned them in a mini welfare 
state, where their basic physical needs are met while they are kept alienated 
from the Americans who foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The toll Guantanamo takes on lives is obvious; the cost in money rarely 
reported. One Pentagon estimate pegs the start-up expense at $100 million, plus 
$20 million a month (not including the cost of the Haitian refuge on the base). 
If President Clinton truly wants to "end welfare as we know it," he could start 
by releasing these would-be workers into the U.S. economy, where they could 
create wealth instead of living off taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 As Father Bryan O. Walsh, executive director of Miami's Catholic Community 
Service and a 35-year veteran of refugee work, told The Times: "These are the 
risk-takers, willing to sacrifice today . . . to have a better tomorrow. They 
make the best possible additions to a free-enterprise system." 
</P>
<P>
 The open society depicted in Walsh's vision of free enterprise is anathema to 
welfare-statists. And it is equally foreign to the immigration foes who have 
relentlessly repeated for at least a decade that the free movement of 
individuals constitutes a threat to "national sovereignty," an "invasion." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are perverse consequences in treating families fleeing tyranny as 
though they were armies spreading tyranny. It warps our sense of America -- of 
what a free country represents -- and our understanding of the crucial 
difference between individuals and governments. And it warps our foreign 
policy, conjuring up military threats and strategic interests where none exist. 
</P>
<P>
 We have begun to take the invasion metaphor literally, to reason that when 
threatened with "invasion," America must repel the invader, by force if 
necessary. So the Clinton Administration declares it a national imperative to 
invade Haiti, not simply to "restore democracy" but to stop immigration, to 
halt the "invasion" of refugees in fishing boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we expend lives to repel a metaphorical invasion, however, we should 
examine the relevant precedents -- large-scale migrations that deserve more 
careful consideration than the Clinton Administration has given them. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 125,000 Cubans who fled Castro in 1980, something like 5,000 -- a mere 
4% of the total -- were prisoners and mental patients Castro wanted to get rid 
of. Of those, the U.S. government sought to repatriate 1,500, slightly more 
than 1% of the total. Yet this tiny fraction is constantly cited as evidence 
that Mariel was a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a disaster primarily for Bill Clinton, whose gubernatorial loss in 1980 
was blamed in part on violence at a refugee camp in Arkansas. South Florida 
absorbed most of the Mariel refugees, with some adjustment pains but without 
long-term trauma. Indeed, research by Princeton economist David Card suggests 
that the influx didn't even drive down wages or raise unemployment among 
existing Miami residents; rather, the Marielistas' work increased the area's 
overall wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Human beings are valuable, even in crass monetary terms; they produce as well 
as consume. Both welfare-statists and anti-immigration nationalists deny that 
value. And that denial has led Clinton to believe that getting Castro to build 
a Berlin Wall will hasten the end of Cuban communism. 
</P>
<P>
 History suggests otherwise. Five years ago, tens of thousands of East German 
refugees poured into West Germany by way of newly opened routes through 
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. But the exodus did not ease the pressure 
for reform in East Germany. It did not "reward" Erich Honecker. It brought down 
the communist state. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a history lesson even Bill Clinton is old enough to remember.

WHEN YOU HAVE INITIATIVES ON THE BALLOT, WHO NEEDS POLITICIANS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Opinion, is a senior associate at the Center for Politics and Economics at 
Claremont Graduate School and a political analyst for KCAL-TV.

<P>
 Charisma. Coattails. Candidates? 
</P>
<P>
 No. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiatives? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 If polls and voter responsiveness are any indication, issues are assum ing 
more and more importance to Californians than any politician. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Orange County poll illustrates the change. Conducted by UC Irvine's 
Mark Baldasarre, it showed "solid" voter support for Proposition 184, the 
"three strikes and you're out" measure, and Proposition 187, the initiative 
that would "save" California from illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, whether or not Proposition 184 passes is almost irrelevant: the 
mere threat of its appearance on the November ballot was enough to put "three 
strikes" on the law books. Still, it serves as an index of voter frustration 
with government's response to crime. Its continued strong showing in opinion 
polls -- the most recent Los Angeles Times Poll has 184 leading 59% to 29% -- 
tells candidates that voters will brook no backsliding. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is a classic message initiative. Even supporters acknowledge 
its dubious constitutionality, but they contend that its passage "will send a 
strong message that California will no longer tolerate the dereliction of the 
duty of our politicians (to control the borders)." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems these two initiatives purport to solve are driving the election. 
Gov. Pete Wilson, who has rebounded dramatically to lead Kathleen Brown in The 
Times poll, has built his reelection campaign around the themes of crime and 
immigration. U.S. Senate hopeful Mike Huffington launched his candidacy, in 
part, by embracing -- and funding -- the "three strikes" initiative drive. 
</P>
<P>
 What's most interesting about the Orange County results is that despite their 
best efforts to identify themselves with these anti-crime and anti-immigrant 
proposals, the poll shows "only tepid support" for Wilson and Huffington as 
candidates in a county crucial to Republican electoral fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians, from President Bill Clinton on down, are strikingly unpopular in 
public-opinion polls. Across the country, voter disapproval appears to have 
broadened to include challengers as well as incumbents. A system seen as going 
sour taints anyone who touches it. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiatives allow frustrated voters to wrest control of policy making from the 
suspect -- and unresponsive -- politicians who run the system. Indeed, they are 
a way to shove politicians completely out of the policy process. As a result, 
issues -- always a significant voting cue in California -- are increasingly the 
rallying point, not the politicians. Voters appear to have just about given up 
caring about candidate elections on any other basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Californians weren't motivated by the candidate races last June. 
Might there have been a connection between the abysmally low turnout and the 
lack of grabber propositions on the ballot? 
</P>
<P>
 History shows that voters can be motivated by hot-button initiatives. And 
which voters turn out can influence the outcome of other races on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom has it that this season's message initiatives are more 
likely to bring out conservatives and Republicans angered by crime and illegal 
immigration. But history, again, reminds us that an initiative's coattails 
don't always work as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, liberal groups qualified a gun-control initiative for the November 
ballot in the hopes of bringing out more Democrats. But it was turnout in rural 
counties that rose, and these voters went against gun control -- and for 
conservative candidates. That helped Republican George Deukmejian eke out a 
narrow victory over Democrat Tom Bradley in the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 184 is unlikely to play any such role because its provisions are 
already state law. But an ugly debate over 187 could flush out voters on both 
sides of the immigration fight. 
</P>
<P>
 If the debate remains relatively responsible, Wilson, who has indicated he's 
inclined to support 187, will benefit. But if the fight explodes into a hate 
campaign, Wilson could find himself caught in the cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 On immigration, Brown is in a tight spot. Opposition to Proposition 187, 
particularly among Democrats and liberals, does not now appear to be deep 
enough or intense enough to motivate large numbers of them to vote. Should 
Brown turn up her anti-187 volume to energize them? Or should she abandon them 
and try harder to court anti-immigrant Republicans, conservatives and 
independents who support 187 and are more likely to vote anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's stand appeals to these voters; but Republicans and conservatives, at 
least, are already in his corner, even if grudgingly. If the governor ratchets 
up his rhetoric to energize the right, he risks losing the moderate middle to 
his Democratic challenger. And a perception of fear-mongering could galvanize 
Democratic liberals to vote against 187 -- and for Brown. Could this be enough 
for Brown to piece together a victory? 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, whoever won would face the challenge of cobbling together a 
governing majority united only by anger and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of November's election could indicate whether voters are really 
ready to take the initiative and simply walk out on politicians. But if 
politicians are made irrelevant, who implements public policy? 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps the ultimate objective of voter abandonment is the demise of truly 
public policy.

BREAK TIME IS OVER; ANITA BAKER'S LAST ALBUM WAS IN 1990. THEN EVERYONE THOUGHT 
SHE WAS LOST TO MOTHERHOOD. GUESS EVERYBODY FORGOT TO ASK THE IMPORTANT PERSON: 
BAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anita Baker has seemed to have it all for years: hit albums, Grammys, 
successful concerts, critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet something was missing in Baker's life: children. Their eventual arrival 
has kept her out of the spotlight for most of the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since her last album, 1990's jazzy "Compositions," her career has taken a back 
seat to motherhood. After her second miscarriage, Baker gave birth to two sons: 
Walter, 19 months, and Eddie, 4 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing how important her family is to her, some associates wondered whether 
Baker -- who is married to Detroit real-estate developer Walter Bridgforth -- 
would ever return full time to the music business. 
</P>
<P>
 There were periodic reports in recent years that Baker, now 36, had returned 
to the studio, but there was no new release -- and the speculation increased 
about her willingness to devote time to a career. Her only appearance on record 
since "Compositions" was on Frank Sinatra's "Duets" album last year, singing 
"Witchcraft." 
</P>
<P>
 But Baker does want a career after all -- and the singer returns from the 
hiatus in peak form in the new "Rhythm of Love," which features more of the 
sophisticated, jazz-inflected R&B ballad style that Baker helped popularize in 
the '80s. (See review on Page 71.)  
</P>
<P>
 With the album just in the stores, Baker spoke about the long hiatus, family 
life and her music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Did you intend to take such a long break from the music business? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Not really -- it just happened. I had to work around my pregnancies. 
There was a surgical procedure they were using on me for the first time and 
they didn't know if it would work. The doctor put a lot of restrictions on me, 
so hard work was out, which meant I couldn't work on the album. Then Eddie -- 
who was an accident -- came along, but that was a relatively easy pregnancy, 
but I wasn't physically able to concentrate on the album for much of those 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some people were guessing that you'd quit singing to become a full-time 
mother. Could you ever imagine doing that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. If I had to be a mother all the time and couldn't work, I wouldn't be a 
good mother. I need my career. That's what validates me. Also, I want my boys 
to see women are capable of more than just dealing with dirty diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So there was never any doubt that you'd make another album? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not as far as I was concerned, but others did doubt it. I know for a fact 
some people thought I'd never finish it. People (at the record company) were 
calling my engineer and asking, "Is she ever going to finish this record?" 
There was a lot of second-guessing going on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you feel about that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: On the one hand, I couldn't blame them. I was pregnant . . . three 
deadlines behind and at least a half-million dollars over budget. But I told 
them I'd pay for anything extra out of my own pocket. When you ask them for 
more money, you risk losing creative control of your project because they have 
this huge investment to protect. I never want to lose that control. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the other hand, being second-guessed stinks. If I were a man and I was 
the executive producer of albums that had sold in excess of 13 million copies 
(worldwide), nobody would be second-guessing me. But I was this little pregnant 
black woman, and they were second-guessing me every step of the way. It got 
real stressful at times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would you characterize your new album? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's not as jazz-oriented or melancholy as the last one. There are some 
contemporary pop things on it, but it's mainly ballads with an R&B, jazz and 
gospel feel to them. In terms of content or style, I wasn't going for anything 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 What I did do was strive for a different sound -- on the technical side. In 
the studio you can adjust the knobs and buttons to compress the sound to get it 
technically perfect, but you lose some of the emotion. That's what I've done on 
past albums but not on this one. You get a stronger emotional feeling from the 
songs on this album. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were you at all concerned that your fans would forget about you during the 
hiatus? After all, people are often fickle. 
</P>
<P>
 A: You always worry about that, even if you're recording a new album every 
year. Most artists are notoriously insecure and I fall into that category. When 
you're away for a long time, tastes change, fans move on. You hate to think 
about it, but it's an ugly fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Given all that you've accomplished, why don't you feel more secure about 
your place in the music business? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I just don't. What drives me is the feeling that if I make a mistake, it'll 
all be over . . . that if I'm not perfect it'll all be over. In a way, I'm this 
mass of insecurities. If I fail, I know there will be footprints on my back 
from these "friends" and executives walking over me to get to some hot 
newcomer. Maybe that's why I'm sort of a control freak. I like the feeling I 
can control my own destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've always had creative control over your albums. How important is that 
to you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's critical. Without it, I wouldn't want to make an album. I wouldn't 
sound like I sound. If I let other people do that, I might be out of this 
business now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have a reputation for being a difficult diva. Is that warranted? 
</P>
<P>
 A: When you hear that a woman in this business is called difficult, you have 
to consider the source. This business is run by men, and often when men say a 
woman is difficult, it just means she's independent and she's got guts. But 
part of that reputation may be warranted. I'm a perfectionist and I'm very 
demanding. I want things done just right. I'm not mean or nasty, just 
demanding, but sometimes demanding is interpreted by people as being difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think that being a black woman has made it more difficult for you to 
become a success in music world? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No question. I've had to fight harder and work harder and longer hours. I 
don't think being black has held me back at all. Being black makes you strong. 
</P>
<P>
 It's tough being a black woman, but the tough part is just being a woman. 
People look at you and think you're successful and figure you can have 
everything your own way. But this is a male-dominated business. You see it in a 
thousand little ways that many men don't treat you as equals. It's not always 
obvious, but it's noticeable to a woman. Men might not even be aware they're 
offending you -- but they are. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some critics credit you with opening the door in pop music for a whole new 
wave of singers, like Toni Braxton, for instance. What do you believe you've 
contributed to the business? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think I've helped make it easier for female singers with deeper voices to 
get signed by record companies. Also, ballads are more popular than ever in the 
music business. The success of my albums may have helped that happen. I feel 
very good about that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has being a mother changed your approach to your career? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's changed my priorities. I've always been a workaholic, but I can't do 
that anymore. I just naturally want to be with my kids. When I go on a 
promotional trip for a few days without them, I miss them so much. So I won't 
stay on the road too long. When I go on tour, I'll take them with me, and I'll 
make sure the schedule isn't too grueling. That's the major difference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would you say, then, that motherhood has mellowed you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not really. I'm as intense as I always was. People have this notion that 
you turn all soft when you become a mother but it hasn't happened to me. That 
world out there is just as tough as it always was. If anything, being a mother 
makes you tougher. You fight harder to earn a living because you have these 
kids depending on you.*

IT'S THE SCREEN THAT GOT SMALL; DO ALL THOSE CRACKS ABOUT TV BOTHER GENE 
WILDER, DUDLEY MOORE AND MARTIN SHORT? WELL, NOW THAT YOU ASK, LET THEM EXPLAIN 
IT ALL TO YOU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In Hollywood, size counts. Whether budgets, box-office receipts, parties or 
pools, bigger is inevitably considered better. That being the case, the town's 
greatest honors, adulations and compensations are offered to the stars of the 
biggest screen. Movie actors are the most luminous in Hollywood's star system; 
television performers may be admired but for the most part are . . . well, 
smaller points of light. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are Martin Short, Dudley Moore and Gene Wilder, who have built big 
careers for themselves by getting big laughs in big movies, doing on 
small-screen sitcoms this fall? 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the answer is that none of them has had a big film lately. Television 
is offering them a chance to work. But more than that, television is offering 
them a chance to do a kind of work that the movies don't. And that combination, 
they say, is worth suffering any gibes about a perceived demotion in the 
Hollywood pecking order. 
</P>
<P>
 "A well-known producer of epics saw me in a restaurant and asked what I was 
doing," Wilder recalled the other day. "I said I was doing a television series 
and he said 'Television?' in a very negative way. Truth is, 10 years ago I 
would have thought the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But times are different now. Who today would make 'The Producers' or 'Blazing 
Saddles'? A studio executive today might not be able to leave the script to 
'Young Frankenstein' alone -- he'd want to pump it up with special effects. And 
I don't think anyone wants to do the kind of films I was making (as writer and 
director) -- 'The World's Greatest Lover' or 'Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother' 
-- because those were small, sweet little comedies that wouldn't make $100 
million for anybody. I feel I'm doing now what we used to do in the films, but 
it's a little shorter. We're doing 22 minutes and 45 seconds of a nice comedy 
story."  
</P>
<P>
 "Something Wilder," in which Wilder plays the father of 4-year-old twins, 
premieres on NBC on Oct. 1. Short, whose features range from the well-received 
"Innerspace" and "Three Amigos" to the more recent commercial duds "Pure Luck" 
and "Clifford," stars in "The Martin Short Show" for NBC on Tuesdays. And 
Moore, best remembered for his Academy Award-nominated role as the soused 
aristocrat in "Arthur," and as a lust-crazed songwriter in pursuit of Bo Derek 
in "10," turns up Wednesday as the father of three daughters in CBS' "Daddy's 
Girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Joffe, a longtime comedy manager and producer who has worked with 
Short and Moore, doesn't believe these efforts represent career downgrading. "I 
don't think it's a measure of success one way or the other these days," he 
maintains. "Film and television are intertwined now. Marty is a product of 
television, Dudley came from the stage, and Gene came from the theater. They've 
all done some of their best work outside of film, so why not now?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Why am I on television?" Short muses, stretching out in a studio office after 
a long day of rehearsals and before a round of late-night wardrobe fittings. 
"My pat answer is that I'm a Canadian actor and there's no star system in 
Canada and we like to work in film, television and theater at once -- blah, 
blah, blah. Actually, this is about the pure joy of doing this kind of work. I 
think television is the best medium for comedy. It's the most forgiving and the 
most immediate." 
</P>
<P>
 The comic-actor has been brilliant on television before, as a cast member of 
both "SCTV" and "Saturday Night Live." On those shows he proved himself to be a 
devastating mimic, and he also unleashed some wildly eccentric comic 
characters, such as the decidedly simple-minded Ed Grimley and the demented 
albino nightclub crooner Jackie Rogers Jr. In 1986, Short made the jump from 
small screen to big screen in "Three Amigos," and last year he made a 
Tony-nominated Broadway debut in Neil Simon's "The Goodbye Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Short, 44, says he's quite happy to be working in television again. "I've done 
two HBO specials and I had an animated, Saturday-morning Ed Grimley show, so 
I've never felt like I was very far away from television," he said. "When I 
mentioned to my agents that I wanted to do television again, they assumed that 
I was talking about HBO. But I've done one-hour cable specials and I've done 
late-night. It seems like the really interesting success would be to do it in 
prime time. That's what intrigues me, and that's our grand experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 'The Martin Short Show" features Short playing the host of a TV comedy show, 
enabling him to do sketches, pre-taped sequences, character bits and biting 
parodies within a continuing story line. The show is something of a mini-"SCTV" 
reunion: Andrea Martin is part of the supporting cast, Eugene Levy will direct 
and make occasional appearances, and several "SCTV" writers are serving as 
co-executive producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's episode features Steve Martin reminiscing with Short about their 
times together on the set of "Three Amigos." Martin also hits relentlessly on 
Short's wife, played by Jan Hooks of "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Short is hoping that the show will find an audience and enjoy a healthy run, 
but he doesn't intend to stop making films and says that scripts continue to 
come his way. "To be honest, I haven't had many true financial hits in films, 
and the fact that I've worked this long and made so many I think is Hollywood's 
way of saying that they like me. It's a very nice compliment." 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks the NBC series may give him the chance to hit a level of 
satisfaction in his work that's been difficult to find in movie roles. "What 
I'm bringing to the show that's new is a side of me I think people have seen on 
talk shows but haven't seen in the movies. Whenever I've played myself in the 
movies, I haven't been overly pleased, and on my specials I've always made fun 
of myself through characters. I wanted to design the show so that I could also 
be the way I am when I'm on 'Letterman.' The question will be whether anyone 
else cares to see that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody asked me the other day, 'What if the show fails?' " he continued. "I 
said, 'It won't fail.' Maybe we won't be correct for prime time, or maybe prime 
time will have subtly made us less effective than we should be. But I don't 
think so. It's been 10 years since 'SCTV' was on the air, and late-night and 
prime time have gotten a lot closer to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say that Short doesn't have a few lingering doubts about how his 
idiosyncratic comic talents will translate into prime time. "The scenario that 
I'd hate the most is that I'm bland, homogenized and a big hit. That's a 
nightmare. That's when you'd look at me and say 'So sad -- we thought he was 
interesting, and he's a jerk.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley Moore is hoping that "Daddy's Girls" will provide him a better chance 
to be funny than he's seen in the film scripts coming his way lately. 
"Television is a matter of fitting the material to the people. In a sense it's 
trying to grasp who your basic character is. And that's what I'm interested in 
playing now. I don't see it in film scripts. I read a lot of synopses that are 
just pale imitations of 'Arthur.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a comedy team with Peter Cook, Moore spent 20 years creating comedy 
for theater, film and television. He says he sees some irony in taking on the 
challenge of prime time. "It's a strange thing to talk about making a 
'successful transition' from the large screen to the small screen," Moore says, 
"because it used to be just the opposite. When I made the jump to films, people 
seemed to go on endlessly about 'Oh, he hasn't made the transition.' I don't 
know if there is much of a transition in the work. It comes down to these silly 
basic principles of how loud and how fast you perform. But the comedy is really 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will say that you have to keep things in perspective working in 
television," he added. "Harvey Fierstein is one of my co-stars on 'Daddy's 
Girls,' and he keeps telling me, 'We are the stuff between commercials.' You 
have to keep that in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, 59, who starred in a short-lived sitcom last year for CBS, "Dudley," is 
cast in "Daddy's Girls" as the befuddled father of three young-adult daughters, 
dealing with a divorce and a troubled business. He is confident about the 
show's comedic potential but says he's still mystified as to what it takes to 
win in the ratings game.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you get some decent writers together and reasonable directors, you're 
going to produce a decent product. The thing is, you have no idea how it's 
going to do. You want to bring something fresh to the show, but the thing that 
seems to get TV audiences is familiarity. How you stay on long enough to become 
familiar, I'm not sure."  
</P>
<P>
 Charles Joffe believes that giving the audience "person" as well as "persona" 
may be the key to success for television comedy. Joffe is one of Hollywood's 
most experienced observers of comedy. Along with partner Jack Rollins, he has 
managed the careers of Woody Allen, Robert Klein, Billy Crystal and Robin 
Williams.  
</P>
<P>
 "The small screen is so microscopic, you have to project a lot of humanity," 
Joffe says. "Television requires the viewer to feel they know the person 
they're watching, much as a nightclub requires the audience to feel they've 
learned something from a comedian. Otherwise it's all Chinese food -- you love 
it for a moment but barely remember it afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key for these three 'new guys' is going to be showing who they are and 
letting their comedy come out of that, rather than just from the funny they can 
create through characters. It's a subtle proposition, but if they can pull that 
off, then the audience has somebody to identify with, somebody they feel they 
know, and maybe somebody they can grow to love."  
</P>
<P>
 On a soundstage in Burbank, Wilder is battling Nordic Track and StairMaster 
machines, adding some slapstick to a health club scene in his show's second 
episode. Director Barnet Kellman encourages Wilder to break into the chorus of 
"YMCA" as he goes for the burn, but a tape player must be fetched so that the 
actor can be made familiar with the finer points of the Village People hit. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Something Wilder," the actor plays a late-in-life father who drops out of 
a fast-track city life to move his family to a seemingly idyllic small town. 
</P>
<P>
 During a lunch break, Wilder, 59, tucks into a plate of rice and vegetables in 
a small office. His piercing blue eyes and trademark halo of frizzed hair still 
lend him the look of a slightly mad descendant of the Von Frankenstein family, 
but he is as gentle and thoughtful as one might suspect from the air of 
vulnerability he brings to even his most crazed comic performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why am I doing this? I asked myself that question after I signed the 
contract," he smiles. "I never in my life thought about doing TV. I was asked a 
few times, but why would I do TV? I loved the process of making films. But this 
show appealed to me, and one of the things that appealed to me most is that I 
didn't have to be Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies all the time. I can be human 
and have softer sides, and then a scene later I'm doing (physical) comedy. 
Movies have changed and television has changed. Now it's a matter of 'let's see 
the work.' If the work is good, it's good work. No matter where it is."  
</P>
<P>
 After the death of his wife, Gilda Radner, Wilder took time off from any work, 
preferring to paint watercolors at his home in Connecticut. He has since 
remarried, and says he has found happiness again. "Something Wilder" was 
attractive to him not least because it was created with him in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offer for this show came at a strange time in my life, and when I said, 
'Why should I do this?,' one of the reasons is that I was asked. You should 
never underestimate the need that an actor has to be wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Short and Moore, Wilder will be satisfied with being watched. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to build a career," he says with a sly smile. "I'm not trying 
to get more money. I'm not trying to win awards. I'm not trying to become 
famous. I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone. They already know who I am. 
I want to entertain people whose days are made a little easier by laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't done that many films, but I've been fortunate in that so many of 
them are well-known. They'll remain what they are whether this show is a 
success or not. The show could be very good and still end after six episodes. 
If I stink in it and disappoint because of my performance, then I'll feel 
really bad. But if I can be funny at my best level -- all I want is for people 
to say, 'We had a nice time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Moore is equally content to give television his best effort. "I'm not waiting 
for my dream film script. I don't think it's out there," he said. "I'm happy to 
have done '10' and 'Arthur,' and why the others weren't as much of a success is 
up in the air. I feel I've always been struggling to make myself OK, and I'm 
struggling again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of the old Hollywood line (about the arc of an actor's career): 'Who 
is Dudley Moore? Get me Dudley Moore. Get me a Dudley Moore look-alike. Get me 
a younger Dudley Moore. Who is Dudley Moore?' That's the path I've taken," he 
says with a chuckle. "It's a struggle to hold on and do good work, but it's a 
satisfying struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Short's search for prime-time satisfaction is partly inspired by the success 
of another late-night comedy specialist who's moved to an earlier time slot. 
"When I looked at Letterman going to 11:30 and making that subtle adjustment 
(from 12:30), it didn't make me love him less," he says. "But he made a change 
because he had to. We're trying to make the same kind of shift without losing 
the comedy. It is a precarious balancing act. That's what we're attempting, and 
I think you only fail if you don't try. In comedy you can never think about 
that kind of failure, because then how could you do anything? How could I take 
the risk of dressing up like Jackie Rogers or Ed Grimley? How dare I? You have 
to be prepared to totally fail. And then you have to go ahead with it. Who 
knows, you might be on to something." 
</P>
<P>
 With that hope, Short is ready to enjoy life on the small screen one way or 
another. "We're finding our way, and I can't wait to see show 10. But if it 
just doesn't work, I'll be more than happy to say 'Let's be off,' and next year 
I'll do an HBO special called 'I, Martin Short, Go Network' and satirize my 
whole journey here."*

WET AND WILD PANDAS; MAKING A MOVIE IN CHINA'S HINTERLANDS PRESENTS UNIQUE 
CHALLENGES -- LIKE PAYING TO FILM ON SACRED MOSS. ON LOCATION WITH 'THE LITTLE 
PANDA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rone Tempest, Rone Tempest is The Times' Beijing bureau chief. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arguments against making a movie in China's Jiuzhaigou National Park in remote 
Sichuan Province in the summer: 
</P>
<P>
 * It takes at least 15 hours to get here from the nearest major city, 
provincial capital Chengdu, traveling on dangerous, cliff-hugging roads rife 
with armed brigands and small-time hijackers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tibetan priests have to be consulted about shooting locations to make sure 
film crews are not violating Buddhist holy sites. Burly special-effects riggers 
and grips have to be trained to avoid tromping on "sacred moss" or "sacred 
rocks." 
</P>
<P>
 * Some native people here are fond of setting up large charges of dynamite 
near hotels and other populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * It is the rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vipers. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments for making a movie here: 
</P>
<P>
 * There are waterfalls that drop like veils over rocky ledges, turquoise blue 
lakes and wildflower-carpeted mountain meadows unequaled anywhere in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 * It is stunningly, breathtakingly beautiful -- comparable to Yosemite or 
Yellowstone National Parks in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * It is one of the few remaining natural habitats for the giant panda and 
therefore a good location if you happen to be making a movie featuring pandas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pandas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the most remote location I've worked, unless you count Cleveland," says 
Stephen Lang, the actor who plays the adult male lead in the Warner Bros. 
family adventure film "The Little Panda," being filmed on location here.  
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like Yellowstone," says director Chris Cain, who is from South 
Dakota. "But they would never let us make a film like this in Yellowstone. 
Here, they let us build bridges across canyons." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the "Little Panda" production crew has also dammed up waterfalls, 
built roads, remodeled villages and, after some heavy negotiating with a 
Tibetan lama, built an artificial ledge on a cliff face. Similar activities in 
Yellowstone would result in a long jail term. 
</P>
<P>
 For two months, Hollywood took over a 278-square-mile national park, while the 
local residents looked on with mouths agape and, more often than director Cain 
liked, hands outstretched.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants money," Cain grumbled during a lunch break interview. "Moss 
is 'sacred,' but then it has its price. Rocks are 'sacred,' but they have their 
price." 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Tibetan village episode, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Set decorator Douglas Carnegie says that when the crew started the project, an 
$18.5-million co-production with the Beijing Film Studio and the Toronto-based 
Little P Productions, they thought the village scene would be one of the 
cheapest sets in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot is an adventure story in which an American boy (played by Ryan 
Slater) and a young Chinese girl (Yi Ding) have a series of harrowing 
adventures as they attempt to protect a baby panda (played by two real pandas 
from the nearby Wolong Captive Breeding Station) from a pair of oafish but 
persistent Chinese poachers. Eventually, the children and the panda are rescued 
by the boy's father, a wildlife field researcher played by Lang. 
</P>
<P>
 Scouting the location, Canadian production designer John Willett ("Mississippi 
Burning," "The Firm") found an abandoned Tibetan village in a mountain glade 
where the boy and the panda are supposed to hide in a hayloft. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the village looked abandoned, as soon as filming started, its 
residents stepped forward to make their claims. They turned out to be tough 
negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 "They threatened to throw us off the set if we didn't pay this much for a yak 
and that much for each goat we used," says Carnegie, who sparked a minor 
cultural incident by accidentally stepping on a Tibetan prayer flag. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the village cost the company five times what it originally 
estimated, plus Willett's favorite wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they didn't steal it," Willett recalls. "They said they liked it so 
they took it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Willett and most of the other crew members are willing to forgive the 
local people most of the daily ransoms. The producers paid a large sum of money 
to the local government and park management. Apparently the money never reached 
the common people. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, they reasoned, the villagers deserve some compensation for having 
their homeland turned into a movie set. The film's 200-strong crew, cast and 
support staff filled the park's only two modern hotels during the height of 
tourist season. The production's 75 vehicles, including a fleet of 
four-wheel-drive trucks, crowded the roads.  
</P>
<P>
 Mountain climbers were hired to install satellite phone transmitters and a 
video room was set up in the hotel karaoke bar enabling several film camp 
followers to do their morning aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two-month filming period, more Westerners have entered this remote 
region than in all the previous centuries combined. Except for occasional 
big-game hunters and wildlife researchers, the Min Mountain range valley, with 
its series of spectacular lakes and waterfalls, had seldom seen a foreign face. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains one of the most interesting ethnic minority areas in China, part of 
the Arba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, in an area 150 miles north of 
Chengdu near the border with Gansu Province. In addition to the dominant 
Tibetan and Qiang populations, the area also has pockets of Hui, Man and Miao 
minorities.  
</P>
<P>
 The result of the ethnic mix, splashed together in the valleys of the roaring 
Min River and its tributaries, is a particularly colorful display of various 
cuisines, coutures and architectures under a crisp, blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowhere else in interior China can an Occidental fare better," famed botanist 
Ernest (Chinese) Wilson wrote of the Min River city of Songpan in the early 
1900s. "With good riding and shooting, an interesting people to study, to say 
nothing of the flora, this town possesses attractions in advance of all other 
towns of western China."  
</P>
<P>
 After "The Little Panda" had been shooting for a month, it was clear that 
Jiuzhaigou, which means "nine village valley" in Chinese, would never be the 
same again. The villagers abandoned regional greetings, instead shouting 
"Huloo!" or "Hi!" to passing Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
 They also discovered that Corbin Fox, a tall, blond 30-year-old set rigger 
from Vancouver, had a 60-amp, 380-volt welding machine that could do magic 
things. By mid-July, Fox said he had repaired eight stoves, a washing machine, 
three machetes and dozens of knives all belonging to the villagers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since China began opening its doors to Western movie-makers in the late 1980s, 
it has proven to be a rewarding though sometimes very difficult place to make 
films. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing and the incomparable Forbidden City provided an unforgettable backdrop 
to Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Last Emperor." 
</P>
<P>
 However, a 1987 effort by director Philip Borsos to film the life of 
revolutionary doctor Norman Bethune, starring Donald Sutherland in the lead 
role, was a nightmare. In cooperation with the Chinese army's August 1 Film 
Studio, Borsos attempted to film "Bethune: The Making of a Hero" in several 
widely scattered locations. 
</P>
<P>
 But like an army that outruns its supply train, Borsos moved so quickly that 
his crew ran out of food and water. Eventually, the crew staged an 
unprecedented three-day strike. Neil Trifunovich, who was Borsos' special 
effects coordinator on "Bethune" and is back in China on the panda film, joined 
the strikers and ordered T-shirts made up with the slogan, designed to mock the 
director: "You Can't Save Face and Your Ass at the Same Time." 
</P>
<P>
 Trifunovich said there is no comparison between the Bethune disaster and "The 
Little Panda." 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, executive producer Gabriella Martinelli made sure cast and crew 
were well fed. She hired Italian chef Attilio Pettirossi, who cooked for 
Bertolucci in "Last Emperor," to prepare the menus. Pettirossi imported half a 
ton of pasta over the mountain passes into Jiuzhaigou. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinelli, who also produced "M. Butterfly" starring Jeremy Irons and John 
Lone for Warner Bros., has a proven touch with the Chinese bureaucracy. In "M. 
Butterfly," she had a story about a transvestite Chinese spy that she had to 
somehow sneak by censors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember with 'M. Butterfly' in an early meeting," Martinelli recalls 
laughingly during an interview in the Jiuzhaigou hotel dining room. "They (the 
Chinese censors) came in and said, 'We read the script and we wondered if 
perhaps instead of having the woman become a man you could leave her as a 
woman.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at them and said, 'Oh, that is a good idea, but it would be very 
difficult.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Because she was afraid that Chinese censors might pull the plug at any time, 
she had to "counter prep" a backup location in the tiny Portuguese colony of 
Macau, on China's southeast coast.  
</P>
<P>
 With "Little Panda," however, and its family plot and Chinese panda stars, she 
faced few of the same challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure political support, Martinelli re-established contacts she had made 
with "M. Butterfly" in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 She traveled to the Wolong Panda Reserve to negotiate the use of two young 
pandas, male Simo, born in September, 1993, and Yue, born in November, 1993. 
The pandas are each insured for $1 million. In potentially dangerous or 
difficult scenes, they are replaced by an actor, Verne Troyer, wearing a 
remote-controlled panda head created by Glendale-based Rick Baker Cinovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps surprisingly, there has been little outcry from naturalists about the 
use of live pandas in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in Beijing, from where he was on his way to study wild camels 
in Mongolia, American field biologist George B. Schaller, who wrote a book 
based on several years of research on pandas in China, said he thought the 
movie might even help the pandas "as long as they are not made to look silly." 
"Acting in a movie is probably a good experience for the pandas," Schaller 
said. "They are out of their cages. It could even be of mental and physical 
benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are accompanied by their individual handlers from the Wolong 
Reserve, the creatures were groomed for their film roles by movie animal 
trainer Mark Wiener, a native of Los Angeles who lives in Canada. Wiener says 
the immature pandas are not as intelligent as the North American bears he has 
worked with in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are a highly endangered animal, he is not permitted to train them 
using treats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark has basically figured out what the pandas do naturally, and he gets them 
to do that for us. They are going to be the real stars of the show," said 
director Cain, whose previous credits include "Young Guns" and "Where the River 
Runs Black," filmed in the jungles of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "This film is a little more difficult," Cain said, comparing the panda movie 
to the Brazilian one. "In Brazil, it was hot. You were always exhausted. There 
were poisonous snakes. Practically everything in the forest was poisonous. But 
at the end of the day you went to a four-star hotel with a choice of good 
restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the young pandas were growing quickly, adding 10 pounds a month to 
their weight, executive producer Martinelli had to move quickly. She rejected 
the more easily accessible Wolong Reserve as a location because, dark and 
gloomy in narrow wet valleys, it had none of the dramatic vistas needed for an 
outdoor adventure film. 
</P>
<P>
 To secure Jiuzhaigou, which was designated by the Chinese government as a 
national park in 1992, she courted the favor of local Communist Party official, 
park director and mayor Zhe Renzhu. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhe, a native Tibetan who was born in the park, once visited Yosemite and has 
a dream that Jiuzhaigou will someday be as famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yosemite and Jiuzhaigou are sister parks," he said in an interview, after 
dining with Martinelli in the movie company mess, "only we have more water." 
</P>
<P>
 When the hotel containing the production offices developed electricity 
shortages, Martinelli visited the local power plant. There she planted herself 
on the plant manager's desk and slowly stacked a set of round wooden checkers 
on his desk into a large tower. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you see this?" she told the manager. "This is my movie." Hitting the stack 
with her hand, she scattered the checkers across the room. "Without electricity 
I have no movie." Power was restored the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 The low point so far, Martinelli says, was learning that the Chinese 
government would not grant permission for a helicopter that she had counted on 
using to transport film, supplies and key personnel back and forth from 
Chengdu. 
</P>
<P>
 This meant that every jar of peanut butter, every canister of film, every 
ounce of pasta demanded by the Italian chef had to be transported over the 
mountains by road. 
</P>
<P>
 Making this film, said one weary urbanite on location for the past two months, 
is comparable "to Hannibal crossing the Alps." 
</P>
<P>
 The route to Chengdu was quickly dubbed "the road to hell" by cast and crew. 
Practically everyone has a horror story. 
</P>
<P>
 On her trip up the rugged Min River valley on her way to Jiuzhaigou, scenic 
artist Victoria Ogimski saw "one tour bus hanging over the edge of the road; 
one bus upside down; a lumber truck over the edge and another one practically 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Set decorator Carnegie is a veteran of three round trips on the road from 
hell. On one trip, the road was blocked by local gangsters demanding a toll. On 
another, the way was locked by a fallen boulder "the size of a refrigerator." 
It took a whole village to clear it away. "While we were waiting I walked down 
to the river and spent the night in a gold diggers' camp." 
</P>
<P>
 But production designer Willett, as usual, had the topper. Driving in his 4x4 
vehicle in one notorious stretch of road, Willett watched with horror as a 
white horse fell off the cliff above him into the river. Willett and his crew 
later nicknamed the incident: "Vertical horse bowling."  
</P>
<P>
 "I've never before in my life kept a diary," he said during an interview on 
his way to inspect a rope suspension bridge built for the movie. "But I've 
started doing it since I came here. It seems like something incredible happens 
every day."*ANTHONY BANNISTER

HE'S ALWAYS MOVING; MICHAEL SMUIN HAS DONE BALLET, BROADWAY, MOVIES, TV AND A 
LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. NOW HE'S BRINGING HIS 10-MEMBER BALLET 
COMPANY TO L.A. FOR ITS FIRST APPEARANCE OUTSIDE SAN FRANCISCO. GET READY TO 
EXPERIENCE A LITTLE GUERRILLA BALLET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Breslauer, Jan Breslauer is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Smuin, the controversial former director of the San Francisco Ballet, 
lives in an airy hillside home that combines different motifs in a surprisingly 
coherent whole. 
</P>
<P>
 The place has a Southwestern feel to it, yet it's filled with mementos of a 
long and varied career in the performing arts. An affinity for the classics is 
as evident as a love of several contemporary cultures -- a pen and ink of a 
renaissance theater character hangs not far from a Native American work. 
</P>
<P>
 Smuin too is a study in contrasts. Ebullient and energetic, he is just as 
comfortable with the canon as he is with pop; with "Romeo and Juliet" as with 
Romeo Void. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Smuin has built his career on precisely such eclecticism. And it's 
his infusion of pop into his ballets that's long made him controversial. "I've 
been praised and beaten up," he says. "It's great for box office when the 
reviews are good, but the important thing is to stay true to the work, keep 
your head down and dodge the bullets." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy seems to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost precisely 10 years to the day since Smuin was fired from his post 
at the San Francisco Ballet for doing work that was too populist. And it is 
also almost two years to the day since he suffered a massive heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 But both of those occasions are fast fading into the background now, because 
Smuin is at work on another major undertaking. His new company, Smuin 
Ballets/SF, makes its first appearance outside San Francisco when it brings 
"Dances With Songs" to the James A. Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood this week, 
before continuing on to the Joyce Theatre in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smuin Ballets/SF is yet another new beginning for a man who has had several 
careers already. An American Ballet Theatre principal dancer and resident 
choreographer from 1966-73, Smuin's tenure from 1973-84 at the helm of the San 
Francisco Ballet arguably put the company on the map. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has lengthy credits in theater, television and film. Smuin 
choreographed the Lincoln Center revival of "Anything Goes," for which he won a 
1988 Tony, and directed and choreographed "Sophisticated Ladies," which was 
nominated for two Tonys in 1981. He's also provided choreography for more than 
10 films, including "Wolf," "Dracula" and "The Joy Luck Club" and won Emmys for 
his many TV shows, including versions of several of his ballets and Linda 
Ronstadt's "Canciones de Mi Padre." 
</P>
<P>
 And his work outside the dance world has been well-received. "(Smuin's work 
on) 'The Cotton Club' really impressed me," says director Alfonso Arau, for 
whom Smuin did the choreography on the upcoming film "A Walk in the Clouds." 
"He's a real pro and we connected immediately. He set the choreography of the 
crushing of the grapes (scene). It's a ritual of fertility. (Smuin made it) 
erotic and romantic. Just magical." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Smuin, now 56, has sometimes felt that he's been treated like a fish 
out of water. "When I work on Broadway, I'm the ballet guy," he says. "And when 
I work in ballet, I'm the Broadway guy. I never am what I am when I'm doing it. 
People don't want you to be successful in more than one thing." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Smuin Ballets/SF features 10 dancers -- many of them San Francisco Ballet 
alums -- plus a featured pair of flamenco artists who are with the group only 
for this program. "It's like guerrilla ballet with minimal costumes and 
scenery," the choreographer says of the program's mostly solos and duets, set 
to such songs as "Unforgettable," "Unchained Melody," "Heartbreak Hotel" and 
"Stardust" in recordings by Linda Ronstadt, the Righteous Brothers, the 
Beatles, Patsy Cline, Willie Nelson, Edith Piaf and the Gipsy Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, it's the kind of pop-influenced fare for which Smuin is known, 
but in other ways, it's not. "The whole time I was in the San Francisco Ballet 
I was a mural painter," he says. "Now I can be a miniaturist. I've done the big 
ballets with 60 people onstage. (This company) gives me a real laboratory, 
dancers that I can experiment with, (a chance to do) things that I probably 
wouldn't have done as director of the San Francisco Ballet. I think this may be 
more mature work." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the bill are segments from some works that Smuin created when he was 
at the San Francisco Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 Smuin joined the San Francisco Ballet in 1973, becoming co-director with Lew 
Christensen, who had been at the helm since 1952. While the title was shared, 
the day-to-day directorship of the company fell, at Christensen's behest, to 
Smuin. 
</P>
<P>
 Smuin is widely credited with having stabilized the San Francisco Ballet, 
expanding its base of support and increasing its exposure through television 
broadcasts. Five years after coming on board in San Francisco, Smuin's "Romeo 
and Juliet" was seen on PBS and won an Emmy, as did his 1981 "Tempest." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Smuin's "Stravinsky Piano Pieces" was televised nationally on "Live 
From the White House." In 1983, he marked the 50th anniversary of the San 
Francisco Ballet with a large-scale celebration at the War Memorial Opera 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the July 1984 Olympic Arts Festival outing of "To the Beatles" -- a 
work that is excerpted now in the Smuin Ballets/SF "Dances With Songs" program 
-- that indirectly provided the catalyst for a power struggle that led to 
Smuin's dismissal from the San Francisco Ballet post. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the conflict was initially characterized as a dispute between Smuin 
and the board over Smuin's contract renewal, the true bone of contention was 
what kind of fare the San Francisco Ballet should present. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one side was Smuin and a group of his supporters (known as the 
Committee to Restore Michael Smuin, including picketers and others) who 
persuaded the ballet to keep him on for nine months after he was fired. On the 
other side were Christensen and the ballet's chief executive, Richard E. 
LeBlond Jr., who wanted a more classical approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a small group of people at the board level who wanted tutus and toe 
shoes and that couldn't even begin to tolerate a ballet like 'A Song for Dead 
Warriors' or a guest choreographer like Judith Jamison," says Smuin. "It's a 
smoke screen. I don't think (my ballets) were controversial, otherwise people 
wouldn't have been buying tickets."  
</P>
<P>
 Smuin says he intended broad appeal, but with a program that included classics 
along with contemporary works. "What I tried to do is strike a happy medium 
between contemporary ballets, in-house choreography and the 'outside classics,' 
" he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He felt an obligation, first and foremost, to the audience. "I never thought 
of it as my company because the title is the San Francisco Ballet," says Smuin. 
"That means you have a responsibility to the people, including the little 
ladies who come and it soothes them. It was balanced musically, intellectually 
and theatrically." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there was life after the San Francisco Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult when I first cut the umbilical cord," says Smuin. "Everybody 
knows everybody and goes to the same openings. I never actually left the city. 
I kept my home and did a lot of work in New York, Los Angeles and Europe. But 
time heals everything. And I've kept ties." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Five pairs of dancers stand facing the mirrors in a fourth- floor studio in 
the War Memorial Opera House. Each couple is entangled in an embrace, though no 
one seems quite comfortable, and the questions are flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "How is it that she's upside down?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Should we still get into the fetal position?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Why does that leg end up there?" 
</P>
<P>
 On the receiving end of the queries, a sprightly man dressed in black faces 
the dancers and decodes the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "This leg goes here, this leg goes over his head, then just bring her down and 
rest her on that knee," says Smuin, using one couple as a model. "Now, bring 
her up, change feet, bring this over her head and . . . there." 
</P>
<P>
 Smuin first danced in this opera house when he was in high school. Now, some 
40 years later -- and a decade after his San Francisco Ballet performed here -- 
he's back, rehearsing dancers for the Bacchanal scene in Wagner's "Tannhauser," 
a San Francisco Opera production that will open in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's the first time Smuin has worked on an opera since 1972. And while 
there have been offers for such gigs since he parted ways with the ballet in 
1984, Smuin has been keeping quite busy in other areas, particularly with stage 
and screen work. "What really has been fun is to work on these big commercial 
projects, films and in television," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And Smuin has certainly not gone unappreciated. The same year that he was 
fired from the San Francisco Ballet, he won a pair of Emmys for the PBS version 
of the San Francisco Ballet production of "A Song for Dead Warriors."  
</P>
<P>
 Inspired in part by his Southwest boyhood, "A Song for Dead Warriors" is a 
portrayal of Native American life, featuring a trio of archetypal characters: 
the Brave, the Indian Maiden and the bad-guy Sheriff. The story is spiced up 
with spectacle and displays of technique. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, Dance Theatre of Harlem has had "A Song for Dead 
Warriors" in its repertory, and at least 17 other companies -- including Ballet 
Florida, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Ballet West and Hartford Ballet -- also 
perform Smuin works. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're out there, they're just not in the San Francisco Ballet," says Smuin 
of his dances. "After I left, there were invitations, but I felt that I didn't 
want my ballets in other companies. Then, later on, I started accepting them." 
</P>
<P>
 And like or loathe Smuin's dances, he certainly was multicultural before it 
was fashionable, mixing the idioms of many American cultures onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 That attempt was not lost on some members of the San Francisco audience. "I 
remember going on opening night (of the ballet season) and seeing the stage 
covered with young black, Latino, Asian and white adolescents break dancing and 
doing all that wonderfully athletic stuff that was the rage at the time, and on 
the same evening as straight standard ballet stuff," says American Conservatory 
Theater associate artistic director Benny Sato Ambush. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applauded (Smuin's) courage to mix the mediums like that," Ambush, at whose 
theater Smuin has also directed shows, says. "It was daring, bold and 
provocative. It said to me that if nothing else the man was connected to the 
world outside. But it gave heart palpitations to the traditional ballet 
audience in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Smuin ballets are less concerned with cultural politics, but share the 
goal of keeping the medium relevant through cross-pollination with literature 
and pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hearts," Smuin's first post-San Francisco Ballet choreography, took on no 
less a task than an adaptation of Marcel Carne's complex 1944 French film "Les 
Enfants du Paradis" (Children of Paradise). 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Smuin's ballets were always ambitious, if not always warmly received 
by the critical community. But Smuin's priority has never been to please the 
press, nor to become a traditional classicist. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees his mission as the preservation of ballet through unorthodox means. 
"Ballet really lives on new and interesting work," says Smuin. "Classical 
ballet is a tool to do a lot of different things. It's up to small companies, 
more modern companies (to innovate)." 
</P>
<P>
 And he believes such innovation is more necessary now than ever. "The invasion 
of the corporate world has had a good and bad effect on ballet, opera and the 
arts in general," says Smuin. "Every town has a McDonald's and every town has a 
ballet company and it all looks the same. The idea of diversity is killed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The use of popular songs in Smuin Ballets/SF's "Dances With Songs" recalls the 
aesthetic that made Smuin controversial a decade ago, though the choreographer 
insists it's never been merely a strategy to please the masses. "It doesn't 
have anything to do with making a program accessible to people," says Smuin. 
"It's just the stuff that I like. What's a better piece of music than 
'Stardust' or 'Georgia on My Mind'?" 
</P>
<P>
 Smuin Ballets/SF is also practical. "We're small and tourable," says Smuin of 
the 10-member company. "A lot of these little towns would love to have a ballet 
tour, but (the troupes are) so expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 The company is set to perform in its hometown in March and December of 1995. 
But by the end of next summer, Smuin anticipates that Smuin Ballets/SF will 
likely be touring not only "Dances With Songs" but also "another program that's 
quite a bit different from this." 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be terrible if we got pigeonholed into 'Dances With Songs,' " he 
says. "That's just what we do now." 
</P>
<P>
 And where Smuin goes, he is confident the audience will follow. "Generally 
I've had a wonderful and loyal audience," he says. "People were very supportive 
when I went through all that trouble, but it seemed like a long time ago. I 
figured people would forget, but they didn't."*

COVER STORY; IN PRAISE OF SILLINESS; LOS ANGELES' OWN GROUNDLINGS ARE 
CELEBRATING TWO DECADES OF, WELL, JUST PLAIN SILLINESS. IS THIS SOMEONE'S IDEA 
OF A JOKE? YOU BET AND IT'S PAID OFF.

 Who would've thought that any performing group could gain in stitutional 
longevity by living on the fly? But when the Groundlings throw open their 
Melrose Avenue doors Monday, they begin several straight days of partying to 
the theme of 20 years of risky business in that most perishable of forms, 
improvisational comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years of organized silliness on the high wire of making it up as you go 
along. As an exploratory form, improv is an ideal discovery process for 
catching the surreptitious breath of the id. In private rehearsal, it's the 
hand that works its way inside the glove of plausible character. But to do it 
in public invites free fall. There's no script, no erasies. And to make it 
funny is harder still. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Groundlings remain, as Bill Steinkellner puts it, "the Lexus of improv 
groups." Steinkellner, along with his wife, Cheri Eichen, is one of numerous 
alumni who've graduated into successful careers as performers or TV writers 
(they worked as executive producers on "Cheers" and "Bob"). But publicly he is 
remembered, among other things, as the string-bean swami impaneled onstage 
somewhere between that nice lady from Wisconsin whose son has been whisked away 
by aliens from outer space, and that dark, ghoulish figure who makes a living 
writing suicide notes for the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvs vanish, the characters remain. Who can forget John Paragon's 
sendup of the oily Latino balladeer Ramon Azteca? Or the way Jim Jackman's 
animatronic Disney Lincoln winds down in a gruesome panoply of dysfunctional 
weirdness? Tim Stack's "On the Road With Guy DiSimone" prefigured Bill Murray's 
unctuous lounge singer, and probably made life hell for at least one Frank 
Sinatra impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at the Groundling Theatre where Julia Sweeney developed the 
pathologically shy office accountant Mea Culpa before she came up with the 
paunchy androgynous Pat (now a movie as well as TV star), whose voice is the 
sonic equivalent of drool (Pat's photograph is mounted on the door of both the 
men's and women's restrooms at the Groundling Theatre). 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Reubens made a career out of Pee-wee Herman; his Groundlings pals lament 
not only his self-destruction in that Florida porn house but his closetful of 
other brilliantly realized characters the world may now never see. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was on the strength of Phil Hartman's Chandleresque Chick Hazard that 
the Groundlings were tapped to represent Los Angeles in the 1984 Olympic Arts 
Festival -- no small feat, going head to head against the likes of the Royal 
Shakespeare Company, Ariane Mnouchkine's Theatre du Soleil and Giorgio 
Strehler's Piccolo Teatro di Milano. (L.A. theater never survived the foreign 
onslaught; of the nine local festival entries, only three are still around: the 
Mark Taper, the Odyssey Theater Ensemble and the Groundlings, who began at the 
Cellar Theater in 1972.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Hartman, who was still holding on to his semi-reclusive day job as a 
graphics designer at the time, had already brought any number of vivid 
characters to life, including the mythic sci-fi figure Light Man ("I can read 
your thoughts; I am reading your thoughts right now") and the international 
talk-show host Gunther Johann, who at the mention of certain volatile topics, 
like the defeat of heavyweight Max Schmeling by Joe Louis, couldn't suppress an 
icy Gruppenfuehrer rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Groundlings has always been a forum for evolving talent," says Hartman, 
who joined in 1974. "Once you learn improv, you realize there's a mechanism in 
you that you can trust, a flash that translates into character or something on 
a printed page. You're never frightened again. I know a lot of movie stars have 
turned down appearances on 'Saturday Night Live' because they're frightened." 
</P>
<P>
 Laraine Newman, Jon Lovitz, Phyllis Katz, Edie McClurg, Cassandra ("Elvira") 
Peterson, Helen Hunt, Maureen McGovern and B. J. Ward are among other 
performers who either started with the Groundlings or stopped in on their way 
to larger careers, a number of them on TV's "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Tracy Newman, one of the troupe's earliest members, observes: "People 
join to become successful as performers, but the skill you learn is writing, 
rewriting and editing, though you don't know it at the time." (Newman, who is 
Laraine's older sister, also wrote for "Cheers" and "Bob," as well as "The 
Nanny.") 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, nearly 40 writers or writer-producers have gone on to movies and 
TV; they include Marcy Carsey, Don Siegle, Rob Gaines, Robin Schiff and George 
McGrath. Conan O'Brien was an almost-Groundling; he was about to come on board 
when "The Simpsons" beckoned. Ditto with Jeffrey Abrams, who was about to join 
but went on to write "Regarding Henry" and "Forever Young" instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people, like actor Craig T. Nelson, didn't stay long. Comedian Richard 
Lewis was too full of New York high anxiety to go on -- before he realized that 
New York high anxiety was his act. Some showed up and didn't stay at all. 
Harrison Ford got a movie before he started his first class. Kevin Costner took 
a look around and told director Tracy Newman that he wasn't cut out for this -- 
he could never operate outside the safety zone of a script. "That was a rare 
confession, for an actor," Newman says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Party time for all this week doesn't hide murmurs of discontent, however, or 
skepticism, regret, memories of pain, concern that the Groundlings aren't as 
good as they once were, or anxious questions about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 How is it that the troupe is solidly ensconced in one of the trendiest spots 
in the nation, with a $500,000 annual operating budget, yet its performers 
still don't get paid? Why haven't the Groundlings, despite an illustrious 
roster, become a breakout success like the SCTV ensemble? Why can't the 
organization cut its own TV and movie deals as a production entity, 
particularly when a reported $10,000 rent falls monthly onto the company budget 
like a safe out of a skyscraper window. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the beefs are a natural byproduct of the growing pains and unavoidable 
internal strife that accompany the volatile and even eccentric business of 
creating the new. Not everybody gets onstage every night. Not everybody makes 
the cut through the various tiers that make up a Groundling's progress from 
improv class to the main company. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people believe that the structure of the organization, in which every 
member of the company has an equal vote in things, is inherently 
self-destructive. The memory of how the group once sabotaged a lucrative 
contract with "The Merv Griffin Show" in 1976 is still fresh in some people's 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to put new wallpaper in the ladies' room, 30 people have an opinion 
on what it should be, and nothing gets done," says Deanna Oliver, a onetime 
Groundlings performer who is now revue director and head coach. "It's pure 
socialism. I don't know how the company survives. Actually, it doesn't. It goes 
bankrupt every five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Too, the drain of competing in a perpetual on-your-toes format can have a 
brutal effect on one's quotidian life, especially considering the wispiness of 
the actor's ego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of the first people here, before we moved onto Melrose, and I can 
tell you that there was not one relationship that came to the group that 
survived it," Tracy Newman says. "Every marriage, every relationship, broke up. 
Of course, a lot of people took up with each other too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Steinkellners, who met at the Groundling Theatre and now have two young 
children, were among the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody dissolved, but a lot of people found themselves back together mixed 
and matched," Cheri Eichen says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some whoppers," adds Bill Steinkellner. "There's nothing like a 
split-up in the middle of a theater group." His eyes seemed to dance with 
memories of Carthaginian knock-down drag-outs that will never be told. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the Groundlings, like that of many arts groups regardless of how 
grand they become, is largely the story of one man. At 52, Gary Austin has the 
ethereal pallor and slender build of an itinerant troubadour (he's a longtime 
country singer). But his slightness seems charged by a small filament of 
incandescent energy. Born in Oklahoma and raised in and around the oil fields 
of Odessa and Corpus Christi, Tex. ("horrible, desolate places"), he grew up in 
what he terms "the environment of the Nazarene Church," whose flinty spiritual 
severity drove him into years of therapy but whose music and preaching 
grandiloquence eventually led him to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 He had the rare good luck to be at San Francisco State the same time Jules 
Irving and Herbert Blau were there -- two innovative theoreticians and 
directors whose influence still radiates through the American theater. 
Classmates Martin Benson and David Emmes co-founded the Tony Award-winning 
South Coast Repertory; Austin planned to join them but never got south of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a friend from San Francisco's Committee who took me over to the Tiffany 
on Sunset one night to see the company's L.A. chapter," Austin says. "They were 
doing improv. Rob Reiner was in the cast. I was blown away. I'd never seen 
anything like it. I joined their workshop, for $1 a night. Ellen Burstyn and 
Penny Marshall would come in. I never felt so comfortable in my life, and 
learned a lot about the relationship between actors and audience by running 
lights for a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Austin had no money and slept on a friend's couch, but he was terminally 
infected with the theater bug. When L.A.'s Committee dissolved, he went to the 
San Francisco company for two years, then returned to join the Comedy Store 
Players (doing stand-up for a while), where he met Archie Hahn and Valerie 
Curtin. In 1972 he formed a company that worked out of the Cellar Theater on 
Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Working Class' was one of the names we were considering, but it sounded 
too political," Austin says. "I got the idea for the Groundlings after I read 
Hamlet's instructions to the Players. The Groundlings were poor people who sat 
on the ground and ate box lunches. That was us." 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of theater Austin favored was in the commedia style, "broad, wacky, 
zany, with costumes and music. The material was in a continuous state of 
development. We never had to sit around and say, 'Let's do a show.' We already 
had one. It came out of the workshop, organically from the work itself. We 
created simultaneous improvs with a story line. We went all out. You never knew 
what was going to happen next." 
</P>
<P>
 The company began to grow and voted to incorporate as a nonprofit organization 
in 1974, "the biggest mistake I ever made in my life," Austin recalls. "My 
brother offered the money to keep it private, but I didn't take him up on it. I 
became an employee of my own company. It's a terrible idea to let actors make 
all the decisions, because actors work in a competitive environment. A workshop 
should be a safe place to experiment in." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Newman saw a harbinger of the future when, after the company moved to a 
grim industrial space in Santa Monica and Austin found a better room at the 
Oxford Theater, one of the actors resisted the change of venue because he'd 
chipped in $2 for a carpet at their present site. 
</P>
<P>
 But move they did. In 1974, the Oxford Theater was surrounded by a red-light 
district, and a steady stream of johns showed up looking for dates. One night 
two hookers walked in, and when they found out the Groundling was a theater, 
they joined the company. They did not have hearts of gold. Brass was more like 
it. "They were very antagonistic and argued with everybody," Austin says. 
"After two weeks, they left." 
</P>
<P>
 T he company roster had swelled to 90 with an annual operating budget of 
$24,000, but the Oxford venue was not, at first, idyllic. One night the entire 
company performed for one customer. And no one could figure out why the theater 
reeked of vomit until Laraine Newman discovered that her ritual half-eaten meal 
of fettuccine Alfredo, left out in the ladies room, went quickly to rot. 
</P>
<P>
 But word got out. Lily Tomlin became a fan and one night brought in producer 
Lorne Michaels, who hired a number of Groundlings for a Tomlin TV special and 
then took Laraine Newman to New York and "Saturday Night Live." Paul Reubens 
developed Pee-wee Herman out of a scene class. 
</P>
<P>
 "The character was called Pee-wee Hymen then, and he was unappealing and 
hostile," Austin says. "He'd throw Tootsie Rolls at the audience -- hard! I got 
him to soften the character and gave him the suit I wore to auditions. Of 
course it didn't fit, but it became so much a part of the Pee-wee look that he 
went out and had a dozen more made just like it." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ralph Waite took over the Oxford site for his Los Angeles Actors' 
Theatre, the Groundlings looked for a home in earnest and found it on Melrose, 
in a building that had been a Carolina Pines restaurant, a furniture store and 
a massage parlor. The late theater producer Margie Newman (Laraine and Tracy's 
mother) lent $18,000 to take over the building, and the staff, meaning mostly 
Austin and Archie Hahn, threw out the soiled mattresses that littered the 
interior and began to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 It took four contentious years for the building to come up to code, during 
which time the Groundlings played several venues, including the Improv and the 
White House on Pico Boulevard, where Kentucky Fried Theatre had made its local 
start before the Zucker brothers went on to make "Airplane!" There are some who 
believe that the company lost a bit of soul when it finally took occupancy on 
Melrose. Others say that that's where its identity became finally rooted. One 
thing was clear: After years of 13-hour days given to directing, teaching and 
running workshops, Austin was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we became more successful, people began thinking of the place as a 
showcase to launch careers," he says. "I wanted the priority to be the work. 
Divisions began to form. The company has always had this suicidal streak, and 
there were a lot of negative people around. I was alcoholic at the time. I let 
people take the theater away from me. If I knew then what I know now, I'd have 
done things differently. I blew it."

 Austin left the theater in 1979. Archie Hahn, who had done more than anyone to 
physically revamp the theater, left in a huff when he realized that all his 
effort didn't alter the one-person, one-vote rule. "I think he's still in a 
rage," says Tracy Newman -- though, reportedly, Hahn's frequent absences are 
one of the reasons it took so long to finish construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Maxwell, who soon took over after insisting on a company vote, ran a tight 
ship through the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to comment on what Gary was doing, or why things fell out the 
way they did," Maxwell says. "Personally, he'd always given me a lot of 
responsibility and opportunity. I think he was frustrated with the committee 
system. Directors like to be in charge." Maxwell was not uncomfortable with the 
system, at least at first, and turned out to be a diligent organization man 
("He was very product-oriented," Bill Steinkellner says). Maxwell left in 1989 
and with Don Woodard is now writer-producer on TV's "Dream On." 
</P>
<P>
 "It became more businesslike when Tom took over," Tracy Newman says. "A lot of 
people disliked him, but he opened the door every morning. He took on a 
thankless job, running the company, a really horrible job. But to survive, 
somebody has to take charge. I think the theater changed drastically after he 
left. It's much more cutthroat now. My main concern is that a lot of good 
people don't get voted into the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," she adds, "it's still a great place to develop talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Sweeney, who joined the company in 1985, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came down from Spokane, Washington, and went to work as an accountant at 
Columbia. I'd been thinking of becoming an actress without telling anyone. 
Where I grew up, actors were looked on as strange people; the chances of making 
a normal living in show business are slim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard of the Groundlings and joined -- as financial manager. I took classes 
from Phil Hartman. If it hadn't been for that school structure, where you move 
through levels, I would never have had the confidence to keep going. It took me 
two years to get into the main company. It's still the place I go for renewal 
and discovery." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Groundlings' future is still undetermined, Allison Kingsley, who 
recently hired on as company manager, believes that a greater emphasis on 
marketing and publicity will see the group through the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Groundlings have moved beyond the kind of disagreements that hurt 
them in the past," she says. "They're more aware of the business side of 
things. I think they're ready for a move into TV." She says the group is in 
negotiation with Fox, through an intermediary, for a TV special. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Deanna Oliver: "I think the '90s company works in a more realistic mode. 
They're more aware of the world outside L.A.. And the writing's never been 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Anniversary week for the Groundlings will consist of a '70s night on Monday, 
an '80s night on Tuesday, the '90s on Wednesday and an alumni performance night 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to vomit with fear," Tracy Newman says. 
</P>
<P>
 What the veterans will remember most, more than good times and bum times, is 
the Groundlings' unchanging sense of family. You move on, but you never leave; 
even the prodigals have their role in absentia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be directing '70s night," Austin says. "None of the negative people are 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 He sounded happy. Twenty Years of Groundlings 
</P>
<P>
 The Groundlings celebrate 20 years of outstanding improvisational comedy with 
a special five-night festival. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday the troupe will present "Best of the Seventies," featuring comedy 
material and actors from that era. This will be followed by "Best of the 
Eighties" on Tuesday and "Best of the Nineties" on Wednesday. The week will be 
capped off by a celebrity alumni show called "Cookin' With Gas" on Thursday and 
the premiere of the Groundlings' latest performance, "Groundlings Good & 
Twenty," on Friday.*

FILM CLIPS / DANCES WITH BANKERS: WILL 'BLUE SKY' MAKE IT 10-FOR-10 FOR ORION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan

<TEXT>
<P>
 When "Blue Sky" opened Friday, it was not particularly a day for its studio, 
Orion Pictures, to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tony Richardson-directed drama, which stars Jessica Lange and Tommy Lee 
Jones, is the last film produced by Orion -- a studio that has been limping 
along since it emerged from bankruptcy on Nov. 5, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the same Orion that was once known for catapulting the careers of some 
of Hollywood's greatest talents, including Kevin Costner, who was given the 
chance to direct "Dances With Wolves" when other studios rebuffed him; Jonathan 
Demme, who got the nod to tackle a risky project called "The Silence of the 
Lambs," and Woody Allen, who released several of his best films on the imprint. 
</P>
<P>
 When Orion originally went into Chapter 11 reorganization in December, 1991, 
Orion was $450 million in debt ($270 million of which remains), and had 10 
completed features in the can. Since late 1992, the studio began to release the 
films; "Blue Sky" is the last of the pre-bankruptcy films to be released. Any 
of the incoming cash from these films has been used to blacken Orion's red 
margins. But that cash flow hasn't been big. 
</P>
<P>
 While hopes are somewhat high for the prestige project "Blue Sky," the 
previous nine Orion films have performed miserably: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Love Field," starring Michelle Pfeiffer, was released briefly in December, 
1992, and re-released in February 1993; it grossed $519,218 on 128 screens. 
Pfeiffer was nominated for a best actress Oscar.  
</P>
<P>
 * "Married to It," starring Cybill Shepherd and Ron Silver, released in March, 
1993, grossed $1.75 million on 622 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Dark Half," a Stephen King-based film starring Timothy Hutton, released 
in April, 1993, grossed $8.99 million -- the largest gross of the films so far 
-- on 500 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 * "RoboCop 3," released in November, 1993, grossed $8.94 million on 933 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Car 54, Where Are You?" a remake of the TV show, was released in January, 
1994, grossing only $1.1 million on 403 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 * "China Moon," a thriller starring Madeleine Stowe, released in March, 
grossed $2.68 million on 216 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Clifford," a comedy starring Martin Short and released in April, grossed 
$6.48 million on 782 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Favor," a sexual comedy that also opened in April, grossed $2.57 
million on 1,021 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 * "There Goes My Baby," starring Rick Schroder, was released Sept. 2 in 
Dallas, Atlanta and Oklahoma City; it grossed just $108,573 in the first 12 
days of release. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Orion also released what is called a pickup film, "Nostradamus," 
which was produced by Allied Entertainment and Vereingte Film Partners. It 
stars Tcheky Karyo as the French physician, astrologer and tortured visionary 
who lived in the mid-1500s and predicted many of the 20th Century's cataclysms, 
including the two world wars, the rise of Hitler, the assassination of 
President Kennedy and the onset of a deadly blood disease, now believed to be 
AIDS.  
</P>
<P>
 "Orion is far from being out of business," insists Orion President Len White. 
"And we're hoping that if all goes as planned, we'll be back in production in a 
year or so."*

FILM CLIPS / TITHE SPOT: 'KILLERS' SCREENWRITER KEEPS THE FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So what do "Natural Born Killers" and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints have in common? A devout Mormon named David Veloz. 
</P>
<P>
 Veloz is the screenwriter who gussied up the dialogue and story on Quentin 
Tarantino's original script about the media and America's infatuation with a 
serial killer couple.  
</P>
<P>
 He tithes 10% of all of his earnings -- including the amount he was paid to 
enhance the mayhem in director Oliver Stone's current ultra-violent film -- to 
his church. (Stone and screenwriter Richard Rutowski also share screenplay 
credit; Tarantino has only a story credit.) 
</P>
<P>
 Veloz, 32, says that he has practiced tithing since converting to Mormonism as 
a teen-ager, and sees no reason to differentiate in earnings from "Natural Born 
Killers." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a standard commandment of the church, to pay a 10% tithing from 
income earned," Veloz says. "The work on this film was no different for me. It 
was my first produced screenplay and I'm very proud to have worked on this 
film." 
</P>
<P>
 But how could someone who professes to be so religious have grappled with the 
pure evil played out by the film's main characters, Mickey (Woody Harrelson) 
and Mallory Cox (Juliette Lewis), who slay more than 50 people by the end of 
the film? And what does the church have to say about that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the violence in this film as comical or surreal, what a lot of people 
have called 'MTV on drugs,' " he says. "For me, focusing on the evil and the 
violence of these characters was like examining the landscape of the darker 
side of man's nature. It was about taking a look at the harsher side of 
society. I didn't just delve into evil and violence, but I also made the story 
more romantic." 
</P>
<P>
 To delve into that darker side, Veloz says, he pulled from such film resources 
as "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" and such texts as convicted killer Jack 
Henry Abbott's memoir, "In the Belly of the Beast," and combed through the 
anthologies of such heinous killers as Jeffrey Dahmer, Charles Manson and John 
Wayne Gacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read all of that stuff and then got rid of it," says Veloz. "But I had to 
know the subject I was dealing with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was working on this film a moral dilemma for me? There was no question that I 
thought about that a lot. The general rule in the Mormon church is that you 
avoid R-rated films. And the church has a fairly strong position on violence in 
the media." 
</P>
<P>
 As the father of two young boys, Veloz also has qualms about children and 
violent films. "I don't think kids should see this movie. But in the end, I 
think this is a movie that has a powerful message about our world. This is not 
a movie meant to incite violence . . . but one meant to reflect upon it." 
</P>
<P>
 LeAnne Hutchings, a spokeswoman for the Church of Latter-day Saints in Los 
Angeles, would only say that since "no one in our office or anyone in Salt Lake 
has seen this film, we don't feel we should comment about it in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 And apparently the church has no problem with the money coming from such a 
violent film: "We agree that the church's policy is not to accept tithes from 
ill-gotten gains, such as gambling winnings or the lottery. However, in David's 
situation, this is more akin to one paying tithes from earning wages in one's 
legitimate line of work, as a screenwriter." 
</P>
<P>
 While neither the church nor Veloz would divulge the amount of the tithe or 
the amount he was paid for work on the film, he did say his salary was in the 
very low five-figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up for Veloz, who also teaches screenwriting at USC, are a love story for 
Columbia called "Spidertown," which is set in the South Bronx; another project 
with "NBK" producers Jane Hamsher and Don Murphy called "Gingersnaps," which 
has Dwight Yoakam attached, and "The Bath," a surreal examination, in the vein 
of "Altered States," of how violent behavior is learned or inbred.*

FILM CLIPS / 'FRESH' FACE: SEAN NELSON, THE SUNDANCE KID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ty Tagami 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sean Nelson had just turned 13 when he took on the role of Fresh, the 
street-smart, drug-running teen in the current movie of the same name. But 
besides living in New York City and liking "X-Men" comics, Nelson and the 
character he plays have little in common. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson lives with his parents, six siblings and a menagerie of birds, rabbits 
and fish in an apartment in the Bronx. Now 14, he has just started ninth grade 
at Manhattan's Professional Performing Arts School. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know there's kids like Fresh out there," he says. "You hear it in the 
news." Making the movie, he says, he did wonder about what it would have been 
like to have been born into a different world, into the world of Fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have lost as many friends as he lost . . . ," Nelson says, trying to 
imagine it. "But I didn't think about it much. Once the movie started filming, 
I just had fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's father, Aubrey, a self-employed electromechanical engineer, and 
mother, Sonia, started him singing in church at the suggestion of his 
kindergarten teacher. At 7, he was enrolled in Lola Louis' Creative and 
Performing Arts Studio in the Bronx for voice training and piano instruction. 
It was Louis who suggested to Nelson's parents that he get acting lessons as 
well, and who got him work in local plays until she felt he was ready for a 
regular agent. 
</P>
<P>
 His powerful, almost wordless performance in "Fresh" earned him a special jury 
award at the Sundance Film Festival in January. But his description of the way 
he worked with the movie's director, Boaz Yakin, sounds more like that of a 
14-year-old than a seasoned pro: "I tried a bunch of different faces, and he 
chose the ones he wanted," says Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the critical attention he's won since Sundance, Nelson says he 
doesn't consider acting a long-term career choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't always have a job in acting," he says. "I need something (where I 
know) I'll always have money in my pocket."*

DOES SOMEONE LIKE THIS STILL HAVE TO PROVE HERSELF?; MARY STEENBURGEN THINKS 
SHE DOES. SO, AFTER TWO HIGH-PROFILE MOVIES, SHE'S DOING SOMETHING THAT REALLY 
TERRIFIES HER: HITTING THE STAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kristine McKenna, Kristine McKenna is a frequent contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Steenburgen played very much against type in her last two films. In 
"Philadelphia" she was surprisingly convincing as a frosty, tough-as-nails 
lawyer, while "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" featured Steenburgen as a 
lascivious housewife in a permanent frenzy over a small-town grocery clerk 
played by Johnny Depp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, those love scenes with Johnny Depp -- it was a tough job," she says 
with a laugh, "but somebody had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Marvin's Room," the Scott McPherson play that opens Friday at the Tiffany 
Theatre, Steenburgen returns to the sort of character she seems meant to play 
-- a modest person whose innate goodness transforms her into a kind of goddess. 
Cast as Bessie, Steenburgen describes her character, an unmarried woman who has 
devoted her life to caring for her ailing father and aunt, as "a caretaker who 
performs her duties with great energy and love. One of my favorite passages in 
the play is when Bessie talks about how lucky she is to love two people so 
deeply. Most of us think of love in terms of how lucky we are to be loved, and 
I find her point of view quite wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with the 41-year-old actress at a sprawling ranch-style house in Santa 
Monica Canyon where play rehearsals are being held, Steenburgen answers the 
door in bathrobe and slippers, then takes great pains to make the visitor feel 
at home. An unpretentious woman whose graceful manners are a credit to her 
Southern upbringing, Steenburgen was born in Arkansas -- in fact, she spent her 
40th birthday at the White House with two old pals from her home state, Bill 
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The beautiful house she's temporarily 
residing in has stellar credentials as well -- it's on loan from Ted Danson, 
with whom she has been linked romantically for the last year and who co-stars 
with her in "Pontiac Moon," a romantic comedy directed by Peter Medak slated 
for release next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Steenburgen and her two children by her former husband, actor Malcolm 
McDowell, live two hours north of Los Angeles, so her weekly commute for the 
play, directed by Dennis Erdman, is a long one. She has no doubt, however, that 
it's worth the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend Tom Hulce (who co-starred with Steenburgen in the 1989 film 
"Parenthood") called and said, 'Someone's gonna offer you a play called 
"Marvin's Room" and I urge you to do it,' " she recalls. "The last time Tom 
told me about something was when he mentioned a book he was reading called 
'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?,' so I pay attention to Tom's tips. I read it and 
knew I had to do it -- it's an absolutely brilliant play that's very funny in a 
dark, 'Gilbert Grape-ish' way." 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott McPherson (who wrote "Marvin's Room") died of AIDS (in 1992, two years 
after the play was first produced), and though AIDS is never mentioned, what 
happens when you care for someone who's dying is central to the play," she 
continues. "The crux of the story is a visit from Bessie's sister (played by 
Jean Smart) and her children -- these people haven't seen each other for 18 
years, and for a brief moment they all become a family again. It's a beautiful 
play in that beneath the broad comedy that keeps the story moving is another 
level about humanity, pain and irony. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This play is an amazing experience for me in so many ways. I've been meeting 
with people who are quite ill, which is really inspiring, and I'm facing one of 
my great fears -- doing theater. I started my career in film and that's a 
comfortable medium for me -- I feel very relaxed in front of a movie camera," 
adds the actress, whose career was launched in 1978 when Jack Nicholson spotted 
her in the reception room of Paramount's New York offices and cast her in his 
directorial debut, "Goin' South." 
</P>
<P>
 "Onstage, however, I'm terrified," confesses Steenburgen, who won an Oscar in 
1980 for her performance in her second film, "Melvin and Howard." "Last year I 
was in a production of George Bernard Shaw's 'Candida' in New York, and 
eventually I got past my fear to the point that I looked forward to going to 
work, but that took a while. I always learn something when I face my fear 
though, so I make a point of trying to do that. I joined a swim team in 1988, 
for instance, and did some competitive swimming (she won a medal the first time 
she competed, so she was hooked), and I sang in a film I did in 1991 ("The 
Butcher's Wife")." 
</P>
<P>
 S teenburgen still sings for friends occasionally, and this isn't surprising 
when one hears her tell of her initial infatuation with show business. Born in 
Little Rock in 1953, Steenburgen recalls, "my dad had a heart condition, and I 
grew up feeling Daddy could die any minute. As a child a doctor once told me my 
father needed a quiet place, which I interpreted as be perfect or your daddy 
will die, so I didn't feel free to be anything other than perfect -- which God 
knows I'm not, so the strain was enormous. What got me through was books. I 
read constantly, and I've always thought that immersing myself in the imaginary 
world of books was a creative way of dealing with a pressure that was too much 
for a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't a movie nut when I was growing up and wasn't privy to classic 
films," she continues. "I'd like to say I watched things like 'Les Enfants du 
Paradis,' but I didn't -- my favorite actresses were Hayley Mills and 
Ann-Margret. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, the pivotal events in my childhood were seeing 'The Music Man' on 
stage when I was 8 and a production of 'South Pacific' in Memphis a few years 
later. Those plays changed my life -- I couldn't stop thinking about them, and 
when I met one of the actors in 'South Pacific' and he said, 'Look at that 
little girl's eyes -- there's an actress in there,' I loved it so much I could 
barely breathe. I've always thought my biggest break in life wasn't meeting 
Jack Nicholson or winning an Oscar -- it was that I always knew what I wanted 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things Steenburgen knows she likes to do is play offbeat 
characters. "In 'Pontiac Moon,' I play an agoraphobic who hasn't left her house 
in seven years. What can I say?" she says with a laugh, "I'm attracted to that 
kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 On the face of it, one might assume Steenburgen was making a concerted effort 
to get away from the "good girl" roles she's come to be associated with, but 
she says: "No, I don't think I've been typecast. If I have a problem of that 
nature, it would be that most people don't know who I am, to the point that I 
have to keep proving myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to meeting with Peter Medak about 'Pontiac Moon,' I had a photographer 
shoot me in a wig and makeup that showed the character as I envisioned her," 
she adds by way of explanation. "On the way to meet with Peter I talked myself 
out of showing him the pictures, though -- it just seemed too desperate, 
although the reason I'd had them shot was simply because I loved the idea of 
the character so much. So, Peter and I met and talked a while, and finally he 
said, 'I don't know, darling. You know I love you, but I just don't see you in 
the part' -- at which point I pulled out the pictures. He looked at them a 
minute, then said, 'You bitch -- now I can't imagine anybody else.' "*

PERFORMING ARTS; THE COMPOSER TELLS ALL (AGAIN); NED ROREM HAS BEEN THE CENTER 
OF ATTENTION FOR MOST OF HIS 70 YEARS, AND HIS LATEST BOOK -- 'KNOWING WHEN TO 
STOP' -- IS SURE TO KEEP HIM THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a passage in Ned Rorem's often brilliant, always stimulating, 
sometimes provocative new book, "Knowing When to Stop," that the 
composer-diarist might live to regret -- if regret were an important component 
of his emotional repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrating the candor that has made him a favorite even among those who 
never heard of his Pulitzer Prize-winning "Air Music," Rorem offers this 
generous morsel: 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't sleep with famous people. Or for that matter with rich people, or 
people in power, used to being the center of attention. I have been in bed with 
four Time covers -- Lenny Bernstein, Tennessee Williams, Noel Coward and John 
Cheever (included among 3,000 proportionately anonymous souls, including one 
woman) -- and I performed out of a combination of duress and politeness. 
However, I grow uncomfortable when in other people's memoirs I read this sort 
of thing (maybe this will be excised when the time comes), especially when 
embellished by the writer's smug sense of charisma, boasting how he wouldn't 
put out for some star." 
</P>
<P>
 The passage was quoted in a New York Times story last January. Rorem's 
publisher, Simon & Schuster, repeats it in an official P.R. blurb. It is, no 
doubt, the sort of confessional that sells a lot of books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a bad quote," Rorem reflects on the phone from his home in 
Nantucket. "I had forgotten I wrote it, and then I read it in the newspaper. My 
hair stood on end. I try to have it both ways. I try to be brash and 
self-important. Then in the next gasp I say, 'Who, me? Don't hit me. I'm a 
lady.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He chuckles at his instant self-portrait. "The trouble with being interviewed 
after a book," he says, "is I've already said it better." Then he attempts a 
neat modulation. "I hate to be mean and bitchy, especially about colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, he doesn't mind being witty, and he has a way with nostalgia, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The most telling reference in the tell-tale quote may be buried amid the 
gossip. Rorem admits to problems with people who are "used to being the center 
of attention." That could be because he has been the center of attention for 
nearly 71 years. There's never much room in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for him -- and for us -- Rorem seems to deserve his habitual position. 
He has a keen eye as well as a sharp tongue, and knows how to use both. He has 
paid his dues as a creative artist, and he has led a wild, spectacularly 
revealing life. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that life already has been chronicled in four volumes of Rorem 
diaries. "Knowing When to Stop" fills in some of the blanks, recounts the 
formative years, expands the dramatis personae and adds welcome overviews and 
ruminations. Hardly anything, believe it or not, seems repetitive, and, as 
always, not much is left to the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Rorem says he spent a lot of time "cutting and cutting." He had to 
satisfy his publisher's lawyers. He also had to satisfy his sometimes-severest 
critic, James Holmes -- the organist, choral conductor and musicologist with 
whom he has lived for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The editors of the New Grove Dictionary of American Music, incidentally, saw 
no conflict of interest when they engaged Holmes to write the entry on Rorem. 
"All of (his) music," a rather prim Holmes declares in summation, "can be 
characterized as lean and firmly elegant." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a lot better than the puffy Simon & Schuster judgment that dares label 
Rorem "America's greatest living composer." Period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I changed that to 'one of . . . ,' " the composer insists when told of the 
press release. "That's very ingenuous of them, and embarrassing to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The title of Rorem's memoirs may strike some readers as ambiguous. The author 
doesn't mind. " 'Knowing When to Stop' suggests a French virtue," he explains, 
"as distinct from a German virtue. Any work of art is unique. That's what I 
seek in my music." 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean he has written his final tome? Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have enough for another diary," he says. "From 1985 on. I could whip it 
together in a couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
 Rorem's self-image seems healthy. "I don't know what my value is, but I know 
what my gifts are. Most Americans are specialists. They don't do two things. I 
am a composer who happens to write, not vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
 Will he be crushed if posterity assesses him differently? 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want some posterity." 
</P>
<P>
 He artfully dodges the issue of a possible relationship between his sexuality 
and his creative aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the sum of my parts. Is a person homosexual while he's (having sex), or 
is he that way 24 hours a day?"  
</P>
<P>
 Rorem was born on Oct. 23, 1923. It isn't easy to think of him as a 
septuagenarian. It will always be easy to think of him as the charming enfant 
terrible who took Paris by steamy storm, and explored the exotica of Morocco 
when he needed a change of space. It will be easy to think of him as the 
poignant raconteur who shared intimacies of one sort or another first with Jean 
Cocteau, Francis Poulenc, Arthur Honegger, Georges Auric, Aaron Copland, Truman 
Capote, Paul Bowles, Virgil Thomson, the Vicomtesse Marie Laure de Noailles and 
Martha Graham -- and then with us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the way I've always felt," says Ned Rorem. "I feel self-pitying." 
</P>
<P>
 Without skipping a beat, he adds a zig-zagging coda. "I don't drink or smoke 
anymore. I have no night life. I want respect. I am what I am. I've proved my 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 He says it, significantly, without an exclamation point.*

ART; LOOKING FOR ART THAT'S LITERALLY ALL OVER THE MAP?; 'INSITE94' FEATURES 
109 ARTISTS, ARTWORKS MADE FROM TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PIECES (IF YOU COUNT THE 
ANIMAL BONES) AND COVERS 37 SITES ALL OVER SAN DIEGO AND TIJUANA. BIG ENOUGH 
FOR YOU?

 What art exhibition claims 78 works by 109 artists, 37 sites in two countries, 
79 sponsors and two grandchildren? "inSITE94," a multifaceted extravaganza 
that's opening next weekend in Tijuana and San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 "inSITE94" is not the American version of Germany's Documenta or Italy's 
Venice Biennale, the art world's two biggest international productions. But the 
show -- which features large, multipart artworks created for specific locations 
and often loaded with political commentary -- is such an organizational feat 
that any description of it tends to boil down to numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years in the making! 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of trips across the Mexico/United States border! 
</P>
<P>
 Artworks composed of tens of thousands of pieces! 
</P>
<P>
 As for the grandchildren -- they were added to families of two of the artists, 
Mildred Howard of San Francisco and Terry Allen of Santa Fe, while the 
exhibition was in process. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project has been so complicated and it has gone on for so long that we 
have become involved with intimate details of the artists' lives," says 
"inSITE94" director Lynda Forsha. 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding. Nothing about "inSITE94" is simple. Even the opening weekend, 
which is designed to give shape to the sprawling affair by focusing on three 
major hubs of activity, is something of a marathon. It begins on Friday at 5 
p.m. in downtown San Diego with the unveiling of, count 'em, 15 artworks at 
three institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors at the grand old Santa Fe Depot will see such wonders as Yolanda 
Gutierrez's cloud-like masses, made of 70,000 chunks of animal bones, wired to 
metal branches that are suspended from the ceiling of the waiting room. Across 
the street at the downtown branch of the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, 
Nancy Rubins' conglomeration of airplane parts will fill a ground-floor gallery 
and spill onto the sidewalk from a second-floor walkway. 
</P>
<P>
 About six blocks away, at the Children's Museum of San Diego, the museum's 
entire building has been brightly painted in a scheme designed by Patricia 
Patterson, as her "inSITE94" project. Inside the cavernous space, Ernest Silva 
has built a metal house as a video/reading room for kids, while Chris Burden 
has re-created "A Tale of Two Cities," the third incarnation of his war-toys 
portrayal of a battle between two imaginary city-states. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday at 1 p.m., the spotlight will shift to Tijuana, where art will go 
on view at cultural centers, historic buildings, the beach and obscure border 
outposts. Among works at the Centro Cultural Tijuana is John Outterbridge's 
poetry-covered steel wall, which appears to pierce a garden window. At Centro 
Escolar Aqua Caliente, a school built near the crumbling remains of a gambling 
resort, Allan Kaprow is installing fog machines and a recording of barking dogs 
around a minaret that once served as an exhaust exit for the resort's kitchen 
and laundry. Nearby, Anya Gallaccio is using imitation gold leaf to decorate 
broken areas of a tiled swimming pool and fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors who venture out to the beach near the border fence will discover 
Helen Escobedo's boat-like structures, fashioned of junk metal, and a mural by 
Oscar Ortega, painted on one side of a building that has fallen over in the 
sand. Those who are lucky may even catch up with Terry Allen's pair of vans, 
which will be moving in tandem on either side of the border throughout the 
exhibition. The idea is to climb a ladder on one of the vans, stand on a 
platform and communicate through loudspeakers with riders in the other vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 In another border location, Sylvia Gruner is installing plaster figures of 
women in childbirth along a corrugated metal fence that cordons off a densely 
populated section of Tijuana from the U.S. desert. A few blocks away, on a plot 
of sand, Ulf Rollof is building a circular "railway" that invites viewers to 
sit in a chair at the center of the track and contemplate a screen of fir trees 
that serves as a metaphor for cultural barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Sunday at 10 a.m., it's back to San Diego, where five museums in 
Balboa Park will launch exhibitions. Additional events, including lectures, per 
formances, bus tours and openings in outlying locations on both sides of the 
border, will continue to Oct. 30, when the show closes. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder this project has been dubbed "the mother of collaborations." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearances to the contrary, the goal of "inSITE94" is not to confuse the 
public or to install art on every stairwell, sandpile, fence, hospital or 
school, as well as in the usual places. Indeed, a handbook has been published 
to provide visitors with maps, photographs of sites, project descriptions and 
artist biographies. (It's on sale for $5 at participating institutions.) In 
addition, a comprehensive catalogue is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 But the aspirations of "inSITE94" organizers are as big as the geographical 
sweep of the project. They want nothing less than to put the San Diego/Tijuana 
region on the contemporary art map while forging partnerships across the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 T o that end, the exhibition con centrates on installations and site-specific 
art, two related art forms that flourish in San Diego despite their unwieldy, 
temporal nature. (While installations are generally defined as multipart works 
designed to fill a large space, site-specific works are created for a 
particular place and explore themes related to the location's function or 
history.) 
</P>
<P>
 "inSITE94" is actually the second in a projected series of biennial 
exhibitions, but it has grown exponentially, according to Michael Krichman, 
president of San Diego's Installation Gallery, a nonprofit organization that 
coordinates the event. Virtually all the region's nonprofit art institutions, 
including major museums, now participate in the show, which began in 1992 as an 
artist-inspired fringe event. With funding from the James Irvine Foundation, 
the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and the Nathan Cummings 
Foundation, "inSITE94" has a budget of about $800,000, covering two fiscal 
years. But if in-kind contributions of materials and services were counted, the 
total budget would be close to $3 million, Krichman said. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney with a longstanding interest in art, Krichman was only 
peripherally engaged with "inSITE92," but he is working around the clock on 
"inSITE94." "I decided to get seriously involved when I saw that it could be 
successful," he joked. Along the way, Installation Gallery, which had closed 
its exhibition space in 1990 and used its resources to sponsor community 
events, was reorganized as coordinator of the biennial exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 The project gained considerable weight and prestige in 1993 when the Museum of 
Contemporary Art, San Diego, became a partner of Installation Gallery, along 
with the Department of Culture of the City of Tijuana, the State of Baja 
California (through the Insituto de Cultura) and the Consejo Nacional para la 
Cultura y las Artes (through the Centro Cultural Tijuana and the Insituto 
Nacional de Bellas Artes). As it evolved, "inSITE94" became a truly 
collaborative effort, with artworks distributed evenly on both sides of the 
border and a mixture of nationalities represented among the artists, including 
a few Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of Krichman's and Forsha's time is spent on administrative 
complexities, they say the project is fueled by the art itself. The San Diego 
area is rich in artists who make installations and need a forum for their 
ideas, Forsha said. "It became difficult for Installation Gallery to keep its 
doors open, but there's such a lot of good work, we wanted to find a way to 
harness it and focus on it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 No unified curatorial vision has shaped the exhibition, however. The emphasis 
is on diversity and variety, Forsha said. Each participating institution was 
responsible for choosing its own artists and sites. Participants submitted 
proposals to a review committee, which offered advice on feasibility rather 
than aesthetic judgment. Members recommended artists and sites, if asked, but 
they served more as facilitators than critics. "In no case did we say, 'That's 
a stupid proposal. We don't want it,' " Krichman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosting unorthodox contemporary art was "a stretch" for more traditional 
institutions like the Timken Museum of Art, which is known for its collection 
of Old Masters, Krichman said. During "inSITE94" the museum will show Deborah 
Small's computer-generated installation "Metamorphosis," based on 17th-Century 
studies of flora and fauna in Suriname, a Dutch colony in South America. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Krichman, peer pressure among participating institutions helped 
to keep the quality of the artworks high. And committee member Hugh Davies, who 
directs the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, and who is Forsha's husband, 
agreed: "No one wanted to be the weak link in the chain." Although the project 
has been costly, it is likely to bring press and public attention to nonprofits 
that normally have a low profile, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 O rganizers also claim that "in SITE94" has created a new camaraderie among 
dissimilar institutions that are sprinkled over a vast region. "There was never 
a reason for these people to sit at the same table or be in the same room, so 
this is a breakthrough," Forsha said. Artists have effected breakthroughs, too, 
though they are often quite gentle. Take Sylvia Gruner, a Mexico City-based 
artist who has leased a three-room house near her Tijuana site and enlisted 
neighbors in her project. A local workshop that produces plaster sculptures for 
sale at the border cast the figures for her work. When she needed a metal plate 
as a sign to identify her piece, a craftsman produced it in a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 She says everyone in the neighborhood knows what she's doing. Furthermore, 
they aren't likely to be disturbed by outsiders who come to stare at the 
figures, which she plans to affix to little metal stools that will be welded to 
the Mexican side of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does she expect vandalism. "My experience in Mexico is that people 
don't vandalize art," she says. "They have a big respect for images, especially 
religious images. I hope the piece will be strong enough that everyone will 
respect it and change it into something meaningful for them." Vital Stats

'THE COLLECTED PLAYS OF JUSTIN TANNER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight plays by Justin Tanner are going up at the Cast Theatre in the next two 
weeks -- seven revivals and the brand-new "The Tent Show," under the umbrella 
title "The Collected Plays of Justin Tanner." Here are descriptions and 
schedules:  
</P>
<P>
 Still Life With Vacuum Salesman (formerly "Barbie and Ken at Home") (1989). 
Former high school royalty choose an unfortunate salesman as their method of 
returning to the top. Tanner calls it his "high school revenge play" and his 
homage to Edward Albee's "Virginia Woolf" but adds, "Thank goodness I've moved 
past all that insulting anger." Opens Sept. 28. Wednesdays and Thursdays, 10:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Zombie Attack! (1989, still running). Co-written with Andy Daley. Three young 
couples confront the living dead. A spoof of horror flicks and the 
"thirtysomething" crowd. It's Tanner's longest-running play, but it's also his 
least characteristic in that it strays far from realism. Saturdays, 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Happytime Xmas (1989, revived in 1991). A waitress targets "Wheel of Fortune" 
as her escape hatch from the overbearing demands of her immature adult children 
and her ex-husband. Tanner and producer Diana Gibson consider this extensive 
reworking of his first play, "Changing Channels," his best-structured work, and 
Tanner says that overall it's his favorite. Opens next Sunday. Sundays, 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Party Mix (1990). A single woman decides to cut out on her own party, and the 
guests take over her apartment. First working title: "Party Slut." It was 
Tanner's first L.A. play, and like its characters, it had a hang-loose 
structure that provoked some debate among critics. Fridays, 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen Girl (1992). While her mother is away in Las Vegas, a Salinas girl faces 
peer pressure head on. This play was the one that made assorted critics, 
industry producers and colleagues take notice, and Gibson still considers it 
Tanner's best. Tanner says its halfway-happy ending reflects the fact that 
until this period, he had never had a "positive" love relationship. Thursdays, 
8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitter Women (1993). A naive young woman, new to L.A., is put through the 
mental wringer by her disdainful roomie, a scary neighbor and a crusty 
landlady. Tanner considered this one his most personal play, though he now says 
it's not as good as "Teen Girl." Gibson actually appeared in this one, 
replacing Ellen Ratner as the landlady. Wednesdays, 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Pot Mom (1994). A family situation not unlike that of "Happytime Xmas," but 
this mom's TV icon is Lucy Ricardo, not "Wheel of Fortune." Though less 
resourceful than the mother in the earlier play, she is ultimately more 
reconciled to her family. Tanner considers this his best writing yet, the most 
satisfying experience for an audience of all his plays, "the closest example of 
what my life was like" and an indication of how his plays are becoming more 
hopeful. But a bitter undercurrent remains. Saturdays, 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tent Show (1994). A group of men who work at an L.A. title insurance 
company go camping together in Big Bear, bringing the office to the wilderness. 
It's Tanner's first attempt to focus on men more than women ("Most of my men 
characters so far have been idiots or pigs or really ineffectual"), though his 
original intent to keep it all male was abandoned. So was the original setting 
in the desert. Opens Sept. 30. Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * All performances at the Cast Theatre, 804 N. El Centro Ave., Hollywood, 
(213) 462-9872. Single tickets, $15. Double features, $25. Eight-show package, 
$75.

COVER STORY; THE CORE GROUNDLINGS: WHERE ARE THEY NOW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lawrence Christon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Groundlings grew out of an improvisational workshop taught and directed by 
former Committee member Gary Austin and worked out of the Cellar Theater in 
1972. Tom Maxwell and Tracy Newman helped out as teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the group grew in size as a performance entity, it moved from the Cellar to 
an industrial site in Santa Monica, and then to the Oxford Theater in 1974, 
before it began refurbishing its own building on Melrose Avenue later the same 
year.

 'Jurassic Park's" dinosaurs are hardly sated. After earning close to $1 
billion in theaters worldwide, they stampede into video stores Oct. 4 with the 
heady goal of making director Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" not only the 
highest grossing movie in history but also the all-time best-selling 
videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, an ambitious campaign costing $65 million -- roughly the same 
amount that it cost to make the film -- and involving numerous cross-promotions 
erupts full-tilt this week onto the American consciousness and will not relent 
until mid-January. By the end of the marketing campaign, more than 8 billion 
"consumer impressions" will have been disseminated, and the average person will 
have heard of the "Jurassic Park" video more than 25 times during the 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to top the previous best-selling title, Disney's animated 
"Aladdin," which has sold an estimated 24 million copies and previously held 
the record for most expensive marketing campaign. (Spielberg's own "E.T.: The 
Extra-Terrestrial" is the best-selling live-action video, with 14 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Jurassic Park' is more than a movie being released on videocassette," says 
Louis Feola, president of MCA Home Video Inc., in explaining why so much effort 
is being expended on a title that would seem to be able to sell itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a franchise opportunity for the company, and we are extending that 
franchise with this video release," he says. "That, combined with the desire to 
make this the biggest film of all time on video, drives us to create this 
mega-promotion." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, don't think of this advertising onslaught as just the hawking 
of one videocassette. Think of it as ingraining you to see any potential 
sequels and ride the probable ride at Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you've just been thawed out from a block of ice dating to the 
Paleolithic Era, "Jurassic Park" is Spielberg's blockbuster adaptation of 
Michael Crichton's novel about an eccentric developer (Sir Richard 
Attenborough) who creates an island theme park stocked with dinosaurs borne 
from fossilized DNA. When the park is visited by scientists Alan Grant (Sam 
Neill), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Malcolm's 
chaos theory is brought to vibrant life as the dinosaurs begin a savage search 
for their next meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurassic Park" grossed more than $900 million worldwide ($350 million in the 
United States alone), spawned a record 1,100 pieces of ancillary marketing and 
won three Oscars for its technical brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
 It will sell for $24.98 (less rebates) on videocassette (either pan-and-scan 
or letterboxed; also with Spanish subtitles). Letterboxed laser discs, 
available Oct. 12, will go for either $44.98 or $74.98 (the more expensive will 
allow for freeze-framing and other special effects). 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of this video campaign were actually planted before the film's June, 
1993, release. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were working with the marketing department at Universal Pictures, the 
staff at Amblin Entertainment and the MCA/Universal merchandising department," 
Feola says. 
</P>
<P>
 After the movie grossed a record $50 million its opening weekend, he says, "we 
accelerated those conversations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 4 release date was selected because traditionally the fourth quarter 
of the year is the biggest for sell-through video product (those not priced for 
the rental market). 
</P>
<P>
 What if "Jurassic Park" hadn't become the monster that devoured movie business 
during the summer of '93? Would the promotion of the video have been as 
strenuous if it had done, say, "Last Action Hero" business? 
</P>
<P>
 "Without sounding overconfident, the level of performance that was anticipated 
on this title was never doubted," Feola says. "(MCA President and CEO Sid) 
Sheinberg summoned us all to a meeting months before the film was released, and 
basically he presented the product and asked all the companies' representatives 
to work toward the common goal of making 'Jurassic Park' the biggest film of 
all time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The machine," he says, "was completely motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, radio and cable-TV ads have been running, and video stores have 
been taking advance orders for the cassette, with customers who secure pre-sale 
copies receiving a free poster of special-effects whiz Stan Winston's original 
designs for the dinosaurs. A contest sending 15 grand-prize winners to Kauai 
and rewarding hundreds more with $300 " 'Jurassic Park' Survival Kits" also 
began in video outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week begins the real barrage of network TV ads, which will trumpet 
the film's video release through January. Also beginning: a crossover 
commercial campaign with Jell-O -- which wobbled ominously in the film as 
dinosaurs approached. Commercials for "Jurassic Park" products from Kenner Toys 
and Tiger Electronics that mention the video join the mix in October and run 
into November, when McDonald's commences its massive tie-in ad campaign -- the 
fast-food chain will sell other MCA/Universal titles in its restaurants; each 
will have a rebate coupon for purchase of "Jurassic Park" (meaning, save your 
receipts). In January, Ocean of America will tout its "Jurassic Park" video 
game and, in the process, of course, the videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, MTV and the Sci-Fi Channel will promote the video release on 
cable TV. And, in a unique promotional gambit, the 1.9 million subscribers to 
the on-line computer network CompuServe will be able to participate in a trivia 
contest to win a trip to Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA/Universal and CompuServe hooked up soon after the film's release through a 
"Dinosaur Forum" in CompuServe's system, in which subscribers discussed all 
things prehistoric. 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe has helped promote theatrical releases of movies before, notably 
"The Mask," "Sneakers," "North" and the upcoming "Star Gate." 
</P>
<P>
 But, says Alex Nikifortchuk, marketing specialist for the company, this is by 
far the most high-profile promotional contest for the on-line network: "I knew 
we were interested in doing something larger with the system, and that was a 
way of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe, Nikifortchuk says, gave MCA ad space in its glossy print magazine, 
and "we, in turn, have one page in the coupon insert in the initial shipment of 
22 million copies of the video." 
</P>
<P>
 Feola says this synergy between studio and computer networks will be used even 
more in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are technology savvy," he says. "Our people use on-line services. We 
believe that we can play well in the future and are committed to pursuing other 
on-line opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurassic Park" is also expected to invade more retail space than any previous 
videocassette. As opposed to the average rental title, which goes out to 
between 27,000 and 32,000 locations, or the average sell-through video, which 
is available in between 50,000 and 60,000 outlets, "Jurassic Park" will be for 
sale "in not less than 75,000 locations," Feola says. The addition will come 
primarily from drug store and supermarket chains that usually do not sell 
videos, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, competing releases have steered a wide and respectful berth 
of the behemoth's release date, with a few notable exceptions -- Disney's first 
animated classic, 1937's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," is due later in 
October, with a marketing campaign more ambitious than the studio's one for 
"Aladdin." That will be followed by MCA/Universal's own "The Flintstones" in 
early November and 20th Century Fox's "Speed," which Fox last week elected to 
rush into the marketplace in mid-November as counterprogramming for "Jurassic 
Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Team "Jurassic" remains unflappable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The awareness and anticipation in purchasing 'Jurassic Park' is as high as it 
has ever been for any title," says Andrew Kairey, senior vice president of 
marketing and sales, MCA/Universal. "The market has matured and grown to the 
extent that there is room out there for more than just two or three titles." 
</P>
<P>
 Sell-through video is the fastest-growing segment of the entertainment 
industry, projected to expand 30% from last year in the United States alone. In 
1993, 4.5% of the 65 million to 70 million homes with VCRs bought prerecorded 
videocassettes every week. This year, 77 million households have VCRs, with 8% 
buying prerecorded materials weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 A lthough the "Jurassic Park" video will hit stores with plenty of hoopla, it 
won't come with the added material that is an increasingly common phenomenon in 
the video world. Many tapes released today include a brief making-of trailer 
and even added scenes that were shot but cut from the theatrical version. (For 
example, one might ask, whatever happened to that ailing triceratops that Laura 
Dern's character befriended?) 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be plans to continue marketing product in 1995," Feola says, 
suggesting that there may be future versions of the movie to come to video. "It 
may very well entail a making-of program. That marketing is still in 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 MCA/Universal's commitment of money and manpower to a movie that would seem to 
sell itself has astounded some in the video industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's huge, that's extraordinary," says a representative from a competing 
studio's video marketing department who requested anonymity. "That's a large 
sum -- that's motion picture money. They're giving a theatrical-style promotion 
for the release of a video. . . . They want a release that not only does well 
but does extraordinary business."*

 For almost a year, the three partners who own Conejo Ranch have struggled to 
earn a living from their new plot of farmland outside Camarillo.Their prospects 
looked decent. But then a series of summertime blows knocked them down -- and 
hope now seems a luxury. Federal officials have launched an unexpected 
investigation to see if the partners illegally destroyed a wetland to create 
their field -- a probe that could cost them the farm. In the fifth article in a 
series following the first year of Conejo Ranch. The Times details the new

GOP'S CLAIM OF VOTER FRAUD DISPUTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The article ("GOP Alleges Fraud in Voter Registration Push," Sept. 9) in 
which the GOP alleges the 69th Assembly District has fallen victim to illegal 
voter registration programs by the Democrats is not justifiable. The 
inefficiency of the system is to blame for two reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 First, duplicate registrations are very common and easy to create. For 
example, if one re-registers and fails to mark the box indicating he or she has 
registered before, a new voter file will be created. Even if (registrants) 
indicate they have registered before but do not fill out the new registration 
form with their name identical to their prior registration, a new file will be 
generated. In addition, human error by either the registrar or the voter can 
generate a new file if one digit in the birth date is inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, voter files are deactivated only at the voters' request or when voters 
complete a new registration form with their name identical to the prior form 
and mark the box indicating they have registered before. Otherwise, California 
does not purge its voter roll of registered voters, allowing duplicates to 
linger in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, the 69th Assembly District is not the exception in California. It 
is very common to have registered voters with similar names and birth dates 
that are either identical or off by a digit listed at the same address. It has 
been estimated that 8% to 12% of California's registered voters are duplicates, 
costing the state millions of dollars in printing and mailing of duplicate 
forms every election. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, if the GOP is looking for someone to blame, it should blame the 
system for allowing duplicates to linger in our registered voter files.

THE RAMS' FRONT OFFICE IS ALL BUSINESS; TASK FORCE TO SAVE TEAM MAKES VALIANT 
GOAL-LINE STAND BUT IT PROBABLY ISN'T ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anybody around Anaheim Stadium was wondering whether pro football was 
really a business first and a sport second, the end of sentimentality might 
have come with a recent assessment of the future of the Los Angeles Rams 
offered by team President John Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision on the location of the franchise in the future is, he says, 
strictly business. And while it is nice there are loyal fans in Southern 
California, he says the offer of the Save the Rams task force just isn't good 
enough. What the team needs, he says, is a new stadium and a much better deal, 
like those being offered in Baltimore and St. Louis. There is no new stadium in 
the plan to keep the Rams here. It is hard to quarrel with the logic of a chief 
executive who is looking at possibly paying a lease of $1 per game and getting 
all revenues from sky boxes, club seats, parking and concessions, instead of 
paying Anaheim up to $400,000 a year. The handwriting on the wall seems 
especially clear. The bottom line seems to be that the Rams are going to leave 
unless the attractive offers fall through and the team has little choice but to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force has done good work trying to put together a package, so there 
is still an outside chance that the team will stay. Credit Save the Rams 
co-chairman Leigh Steinberg and company with being businesslike themselves and 
refusing to put local backers into too much financial jeopardy in favor of 
trying to present "a competitive and financially sound package." By the way, 
speaking of being businesslike, there isn't much of a bargain for the city in 
Shaw's statement that he would not rule out a controversial admissions tax on 
sporting and amusement venues, traditionally opposed by the team, in order to 
make a deal. The last thing the other entertainment companies in Anaheim need 
is an amusement tax when prices already are high and they are competing for 
tourist and leisure dollars. Disney has gone so far as to warn that such a tax 
could be the end of plans for a Disneyland expansion.  
</P>
<P>
 For now, it doesn't look especially good, but to paraphrase Yogi Berra, sage 
of another sport, the game isn't over until it's over.

LAND TRADE FEASIBLE FOR BOLSA CHICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In the Times editorial "Middle Ground is Best for Bolsa Chica, (Sept. 4)" 
the statements are made that "The proposal for a huge new housing development 
has some people believing that no development is the best plan of all. That's 
clearly unrealistic." Not so. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Times editorial has commented favorably on the proposed land swap 
involving the canyons of Santa Ana mountains owned by the Irvine Co. with the 
El Toro Marine base owned by federal government, thus preserving the canyons as 
environmental sensitive open space with no development, while compensating the 
landowner with equal value. This plan is certainly realistic, although not 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar land trade involving the Bolsa Chica for closed military bases or 
other surplus federal land would also preserve Bolsa Chica as a federal 
wildlife refuge or biodiversity park while compensating the Koll Real Estate 
Group with equal value. Like the Irvine Co. land trade, this scenario is not 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly what's good for the goose (the Irvine Co.) should be good for the 
gander (the Koll Co.). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The Times editorial (Sept. 4) aptly put the Bolsa Chica development in 
perspective: It is indeed "Reality Check Time For All Participants." 
</P>
<P>
 For its sober assessment of all sides of the issue, The Times is to be 
commended. You have enunciated a strong, clear statement of reality that is 
long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former member of the Orange County Planning Commission, (I believe) you 
appropriately placed the responsibility for the planning process under the 
cognizance of those duly constituted to oversee land development planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Special interest groups clearly have a voice at the hearing, but must never be 
allowed to take over the process to the detriment of the principals in the 
case: The landowner, and county and state planning bodies.

FULLERTON WILL GAIN TAX REVENUE FROM NEW USE OF HUGHES PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As you may have heard by now, Hughes Aeronautics and Electronics Co. has 
announced that it will transfer its Fullerton operations to El Segundo and Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 I can assure that (Fullerton) worked closely with state, regional and local 
officials in a strong effort to urge Hughes to remain in Fullerton. The "Red 
Team" we formed met with Hughes' top officials and showed them that the cost of 
doing business here was far more economical than in El Segundo or Long Beach. 
Further, we stressed that Fullerton offers a pro-business city attitude, as 
well as outstanding community amenities which would benefit Hughes' employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, however, Hughes' decision had more to do with the efficient use 
of its corporate resources than with community issues. In fact, the high 
potential resale value of Hughes' Fullerton land holdings apparently was a 
factor in the decision to close the Fullerton facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The question on all our minds now is: What will be the impact of Hughes' 
departure? 
</P>
<P>
 First, jobs: While Hughes will transfer 6,800 jobs out of Fullerton, we need 
to remember that it is vitally important to the Southern California economy 
that companies such as Hughes remain strong and viable, and this consolidation 
is designed to accomplish that. It's our loss, but, in the long run, it is 
better for the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the financial impact: Actually, there is some positive news here. Much 
of Hughes' property has been under the protection of Proposition 13, and its 
valuation has not been reassessed for years. As the land's use and ownership 
changes, the property will be reassessed, and the city stands to gain 
considerably more property tax income as a result. Any residential or 
commercial development on the site will generate local sales and sale-tax 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as we regret the loss of these local jobs, we need to keep in mind 
that Hughes has already cut 7,700 Fullerton jobs, and our economy has absorbed 
those losses. We have 10,300 other businesses operating in the city, and 
together they are creating a vital and diverse economy that is extremely well 
positioned for future growth.

COUNTY CANNOT ACT ALONE ON JAIL PLAN; EXPANSION -- OF FACILITIES AND DECISION 
MAKING -- NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates was right last month to keep up the pressure 
for more jail cells, but his claim that officials can skip an environmental 
impact report when they expand the Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange was dubious. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates termed the jail overcrowding situation "impossible," which it is, and 
said in recent years he has been forced to release thousands of inmates before 
they would have finished their terms because he needed the cells for new 
inmates. Many people charged with misdemeanors do not even see the inside of a 
jail before their trials; they are given citations and told to show up in 
court. Gates said nearly 60% of those given the citations failed to appear in 
court when ordered, an alarming percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff said he needed 3,000 new beds in the jails now and will need 
another 7,000 in the next 10 years. One short-term solution is expanding Lacy. 
A proposal by county planners to do that envisioned a drastic increase in the 
number of inmates in the branch jail from the current 1,300 to as many as 4,500 
in an emergency. That would be only in "emergency" situations, but even so that 
number would be too many, since it would require building on just about every 
square foot of space on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be reasonable to add bunks in existing cells, which would gain 358 
beds. Building two additional housing units would gain another 614 beds. That 
would be worthwhile if the county can find the money not just to build, but 
also to operate the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Orange and nearby businesses are understandably concerned by the 
proposed expansion, and especially by the recent inclusion of maximum-security 
inmates in a facility originally planned for lower-risk criminals. The city 
filed a lawsuit earlier this year, challenging the transfer of more dangerous 
inmates to the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 That lawsuit and longstanding concerns by Orange officials that they are 
shouldering much of the burden of the jail overcrowding problem are reasons why 
the county must talk to the city, not try to ride roughshod over it. And 
pressing ahead without an environmental impact report would be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff said he believes state law would not require the report for the 
expansion, but a number of lawyers said that claim is doubtful. It would likely 
prompt another lawsuit, costing the city and the county legal fees better spent 
on expanding jails or building a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the construction of a new jail that is a major problem, since no one 
wants it in his back yard, and no supervisor wants it in his or her district. 
But the county should decide at last where to put one. Orange County voters are 
thought to be tough on crime and strong supporters of the "three strikes" law 
that requires sentences up to life in prison for those convicted of three 
serious or violent crimes. But before the criminals get to prison, they spend 
time in the county jails, and the new law is already contributing to 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 16 years since a federal judge ordered the county to stop 
overcrowding in its jails. Since that time, existing jails have been expanded 
and a new facility built in Santa Ana near the main jail. But the county's 
population has also increased, bringing with it a need for new facilities, 
including jails. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the Board of Supervisors will have two new members. They can make 
a mark by contributing to a discussion of where to put a new jail and how to 
raise money for it. They should do so, stepping forward where the county needs 
leadership.

United States Postal Service lately, I'm sure they will appreciate kudos when 
they do something above and beyond the call of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been eagerly awaiting a certified letter . . . running out every day 
when the mail carrier came to see if my letter was there. No luck. The carrier 
took my phone number and said she would call when the letter came in; early one 
recent morning she gave me the good news! Now that is service! Maybe all we 
need to do is ask to get better service!

LONG-TERM DAY-CARE SOLUTIONS NEEDED; SCRAMBLE IN CAPISTRANO SCHOOL DISTRICT IS 
EXAMPLE OF HOW THINGS SHOULDN'T WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The aftereffects of the 1980s South County building boom were obvious this 
month with the opening of five new elementary schools in the Capistrano Unified 
School District. That was more new schools than any other district in the state 
opened this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last four years, the district's enrollment from kindergarten through 
high school has increased more than 16%, the most in the county and well above 
the 6.4% rate statewide. New teachers, administrators and buildings have been 
pressed into service for a student population that has swelled past 32,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Another need has been day-care for elementary students, many of whom come from 
families where both parents must work to keep up with the cost of living in 
Orange County. Preschools, latchkey kids and after-school classes all have 
become parts of our landscape, and the scramble by parents to find substitutes 
when something goes awry with day care is commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was upsetting for parents in the sprawling Capistrano Unified district, 
which stretches from Mission Viejo to San Clemente, when the state Department 
of Social Services and the Orange County YMCA were unable to resolve their 
differences over the district's day-care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the state displayed some flexibility. It allowed the YMCA to 
handle more students at four elementary schools than last year. But that 
flexibility came only after the state waited too long in telling the YMCA it 
was rejecting its earlier plans. After all, the YMCA, which has operated 
day-care programs for the district since the 1970s, applied in March for 
permission to take care of 200 more students. The state did not turn thumbs 
down until the end of August, two weeks before the schools opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the state's objections seem bureaucratic, including the requirement 
for new fire safety certificates for YMCA classrooms used for day-care, this 
after the classrooms had already been certified by the fire department for 
regular school classes. Others appeared more substantive, such as missing 
strict time limits to submit fingerprints of persons working with the children. 
</P>
<P>
 YMCA President Art Wannlund was right when he said the district needs to work 
out long-term solutions with the state. About 200 parents were left scrambling 
temporarily by the wrangling between the state and the YMCA. Though their 
problems were solved eventually, they deserve more certainty in making plans to 
care for their children in a growing district.

TOLL ROAD WOULD CUT A WICKED SWATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with dismay an advertisement in the Sunday issue of The Times placed 
by the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency. In the advertisement, 
the agency claims it will be spending $67 million to protect the environment. I 
consider this claim to be grossly hypocritical in light of the tremendous, 
permanent environmental damage that will be done to the affected areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency would lead us to believe that it is doing everyone and the 
environment a favor by blasting a toll road through pristine canyon and coastal 
areas. A toll road that few people in the county want. A toll road that a 
recent traffic survey showed that more than 80% of those currently using the 
Newport Coast Road, which will be incorporated into the toll road, will no 
longer use and will detour through Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, I find it reprehensible that the agency would use funds coming 
from state bonds that the taxpayers are financing to run this hypocritical 
advertisement. If the public support were there for the toll road, the agency 
would not need to run an ad to convince us how environmentally sound it was 
going to be. Boycott the toll road! It's not too late to stop it! 
</P>

 * Long ago I learned that the quality of our democracy depends upon its 
informed citizenry , which relies largely upon an unbiased and responsible 
press. As an adult I have relied upon The Los Angeles Times for much 
information. Thus, when last weekend The Times failed to cover a rally at which 
people protested the construction of the San Joaquin Hills tollway within the 
fragile greenbelt located along the Laguna Coast, I was aghast. One thousand 
men, women and children lining Laguna Canyon Road in peaceful protest was 
another in a long panorama of demonstrations. These people express relentless 
respect and affection for the urban wilderness found in the canyon and 
concomitant revulsion for a system that would irrevocably destroy it! 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that "Hands Across the Canyon" was a newsworthy event. For 
one thing, what sustains these die-hards? The answer is revealed in remarks 
made at the rally. As Orange Countian Lida Lenney passionately proclaimed, 
"Laguna Canyon is our rain forest!" If the tollway is allowed to proceed 
through this land, a concrete swath will fragment the unique system of coastal 
parks and reserves whose central link is Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. This 
park system is the people's land, fought and paid for, directly or through 
development mitigation, by citizens. Informed and responsible, they should 
question the judgments of planners who would propose a toll road through this 
land, relying on 20-year-old data, to justify it. 
</P>
<P>
 When today California's urban wilderness -- our precious natural and 
recreational resources -- are being paved over at an alarming rate, defiant 
people deserve the dignity of your attention. Shame on The Times for failing 
us.

LOWER STANDARDS FAIL THE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * While it is often futile to question the proclamations of any district 
school board, one must surely question the wisdom of the recent Huntington 
Beach Union High School District Board of Education proposal to partially waive 
second language arts and computer competency requirements for graduating 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 While the current fiscal environment causes belt-tightening at all levels, we 
must certainly question how low we are willing to reduce minimal achievement 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 As our economy becomes more multinational, multilingual, multicultural, and 
technologically dependent, we must ask ourselves how well our educational 
system is preparing students for the employment needs of the 21st Century. I 
suggest that cutting second language and technological competency requirements 
is not in the best interest of our students. 
</P>
<P>
 If this action does becomes finalized the board might consider replacing the 
lost requirements with a job training program that will meet the needs of the 
employment opportunities to which students will be suited. A short course 
demonstrating the proper ways to wear a funny hat and correctly state "Do you 
want fries with that?" might better equip graduates with the job skills the 
board's proposals are preparing them for. 
</P>
<P>
 Good luck, Class of 2000.

POLICE OFFICERS NEED CITIZENS' SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with amazement the comments of Patrick T. Maher and his perception of 
police officers in our current society (Letters, Sept. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Mr. Maher does not recognize the fact that crime is more rampant 
now than anytime in our nation's history.Criminals are more violent, 
gang-related crimes reach almost every neighborhood and drugs are openly sold 
in schools and locations in every city. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers not only see this daily, but they are often victims of this 
violence and are injured on duty now more than ever. In addition, police 
officers are frequently the targets of unscrupulous attorneys and liberals 
looking to file unwarranted lawsuits for financial gain or publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 These types of individuals have no conception of the true meaning of justice 
and of the barriers that prevent police from doing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 To make our streets safe in the 1990s, law enforcement needs the support of 
its citizens and civic groups. It does not need counter-protective 
second-guessing and undermining (of) their effectiveness.

FLAGGING DOWN 'PATRIOTIC' BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Like young Ryan Christensen ("Tire Dealer: Don't Tread on Me," Sept. 2) , I 
am an Eagle Scout -- but apparently of a different stripe. When I was a Scout 
we were proud to be selected to take the flag down every evening and raise it 
the next day.We'd never dream of it being up 24 hours, or, as is the case with 
these men, being commercially used. 
</P>
<P>
 And commercial it is -- there's nothing "patriotic" about it! 
</P>
<P>
 And I think I can comment on that too. I was a naval officer in World War II. 
Also, I have a Stanford MBA in marketing, so I know something of selling and 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a repugnance, this use of the flag to "catch attention" to a commercial 
establishment. It's no different than the other possibly self-proclaimed 
patriotic businesses that fly American flags so huge that they almost defy 
imagination -- and don't kid yourselves, it's purely business!

TAXPAYERS PICK UP ALCOHOL ABUSE TAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Recently, I've read of two terrible tragedies here in Orange County where 
the main factor was drinking. One case involved a carjacking in which the 
victim -- a young student -- was shot in the head.A 20-year-old man sentenced 
to life in prison without parole said he "had been drinking heavily the night 
of the crime and every day for six months before. If I wasn't drunk, I know I 
could have done something to save (the victim's) life." In the other related 
case, a teacher who shot another teacher said she had been drinking heavily 
before the killing, and indicated that it otherwise would not have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Some studies show that about half the people in prisons were under the 
influence of alcohol when they committed their crimes. By a bombardment of TV 
advertising and other heavy promotion of drinking, the makers, sellers and 
marketeers of beer and other alcoholic beverages thrive on excess. Shouldn't 
the monetary costs come out of their huge profits and the pockets of alcohol 
consumers, instead of from us ordinary taxpayers? Why should we be the ones who 
have to pay for police, CHP, ambulances, emergency medical care, hospitals, 
courts and prisons? Why?

INEFFECTIVE BUS-LIGHTS LAW WILL GIVE US FALSE SENSE OF TRAFFIC SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am writing in response to your editorial ("Weak but Needed Safety Step," 
Sept. 3) in which you supported the bill passed by the state Legislature 
regarding the use of flashing lights on school buses. Although I agree that the 
bill is weak, I must take issue with your assessment that it is a first step 
toward the ultimate goal of requiring the use of the flashing lights whenever 
the bus stops to load and unload passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing law requires the use of the flashing lights only when children 
must cross the street to get to and from their assigned stop, and prohibits the 
use of the flashing lights in any other circumstance. The new legislation would 
only allow school districts to obtain permission to flash the lights at stops 
which "present a unique traffic hazard." This immediately eliminates most 
stops. This means that if a school district wanted to designate such a stop, it 
would be required to prove that it met the "unique" status which the law has 
defined. It is doubtful that the school districts would be willing to jump 
through the necessary hoops to accomplish this for more than a handful of stops 
if any at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument for using the lights at all stops is simple. Children as young as 
4 years old ride the bus. To assume that a child of this age will behave in a 
predictable manner is courting disaster. We must start with the assumption that 
children this young will do the unpredictable. Any vehicle passing a stopped 
bus from the rear would be unable to see a child entering the roadway from in 
front of the bus. The child's view would likewise be obstructed. This creates a 
condition where chance accidents are guaranteed to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the new legislation is in the randomness of these incidents. 
Since the danger presented by the lack of visibility is inherent in all stops, 
we cannot predict at which stop the next accident will happen. This means there 
would be only an insignificant reduction in the odds of an accident occurring. 
This is unacceptable.  
</P>
<P>
 This issue is a matter of life and death and we cannot afford to settle for 
ineffective legislation which says something but in reality does nothing. The 
passage of this bill will allow those opposed to using the lights to falsely 
claim that action has already been taken. I believe that in the long run this 
will make it more difficult to get truly effective legislation enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, I have asked Gov. Wilson to take a stand on this issue and 
veto the bill in its present form and send it back to the Legislature. In my 
view it not only doesn't do enough, it does nothing at all.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; IN THE BEST OF HANDS; HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD, DR. RANDY 
SHERMAN REPAIRS DEVASTATING WOUNDS INFLICTED BY NATURE AND ACCIDENTS. ONLY 
FAMILY AND FLYING, PERHAPS, BRING HIM MORE HAPPINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike the others, the boy ridiculed by classmates as medio beso , or 
half-kiss, does not squirm as he gets closer to the operating room and Dr. 
Randy Sherman. Maicol Diaz has waited too long, prayed too hard for this day, 
and now that it is here, he is treating it like a big adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Barefoot and dressed in hospital pajamas and an orange plastic visor, Maicol 
shoots smiles at the nurses and happily greets Sherman, a Los Angeles plastic 
surgeon who speaks to him in passable Spanish. Sitting on the surgery table on 
the fourth floor of Hospital Infantil, the children's hospital, Maicol looks 
out the window and sees the tidy red-tile rooftops and weather-beaten brick and 
stucco walls of the small homes and businesses in the neighborhood. Beyond them 
are the scalloped shapes of the Andes, topped by a slate roof of low clouds. 
Maicol takes a last look, then lies back so they can put him under. He was born 
with a cleft in his lip: a large, ugly separation that has pulled up and 
stretched the right side of his mouth and nose for all his nine years, exposing 
gums and a cluster of badly aligned teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Maicol been born in the United States, the congenital disability almost 
certainly would have been surgically corrected shortly after birth. But this is 
Colombia, and it has not been fixed. He has been forced to live with the 
deformity. 
</P>
<P>
 Tormented by classmates, Maicol quit school when he was 7, his father says. 
"He is a tough kid," Gonzalo Diaz says. "But they kept calling him bad names, 
like medio beso. The names made him sad, angry. He got in fights. Finally, he 
quit school." 
</P>
<P>
 As surgeries go, this one does not pose much of a challenge for Sherman, who 
sees himself as "a wound doctor," rather than as a specialist in tummy tucks, 
nose jobs and face lifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take care of people's wounds -- congenital wounds, traumatic wounds, 
wounds from the ravages of cancer," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, where he works out of USC University Hospital and teaches at 
the USC School of Medicine, he is acclaimed for his ability to repair badly 
damaged hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn by the unique rewards of operating on children such as Maicol, Sherman 
regularly volunteers for missions like the one that brought him to Bogota. Past 
trips with Operation Smile International, a nonprofit group that exists solely 
to provide corrective surgeries for children, have taken him to Vietnam, China, 
Russia, Kenya, Ghana and Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Maicol is Sherman's second patient on the first of five days of almost nonstop 
surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
 He begins by painting fine lines on the boy's mouth in black ink, mentally 
rearranging the lips and mouth, imagining a perfect face. He seeks out physical 
markers, such as the Cupid's bow, the little heart-shaped dip on the upper lip 
of a normal face. And he studies the nose, which has been pulled unnaturally to 
the right by the cleft in the lip. 
</P>
<P>
 Working intently, almost wordlessly, he spends just more than an hour on 
Maicol, cutting, sewing, taking apart, then rearranging. Sherman's gifted hands 
are graceful and sure. They are hands that once molded Missouri River clay into 
bowls, that have played the piano with artistry. And now they are releasing 
Maicol from the face that has brought him so much pain. 
</P>
<P>
 After it is over, looking at the changes, Sherman nods his head approvingly. 
An immense smile creases his face as he studies the nose, the geometry, depth 
and thickness of the repaired lip. "See the rectangular shape of that nostril?" 
he asks. "It's almost a perfect match to the other one." 
</P>
<P>
 The success erases the fatigue of the 12-hour trip from Los Angeles, makes a 
memory of the start-up jitters that go with working in an unfamiliar hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very wonderful to take a kid who has such an outstanding facial defect 
and normalize him," Sherman says. "We don't know whether the kid's going to 
grow up to be the president or a criminal. . . . You have given them a little 
more of an equal chance. What more can you give someone?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then, it's back to Surgery Room II, where the next patient is waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Her name is Irma. A lively 6-month-old, she has big brown eyes that never seem 
to rest. Irma has been brought to the hospital from a local orphanage. Its 
administrators would like to place her with an American family, and they 
believe surgery will make that possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspecting the little girl, Sherman sees that she has a more serious problem 
than Maicol -- a bilateral cleft, or two gaping openings on each side of the 
mouth that stretch to the nose. He knows that Irma will need follow-up 
surgeries. On the plus side, she has what he calls "fresh lips," meaning no 
doctor has worked on them, and he can do the surgery right the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's go," he says, turning to scrub. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky 
at night. . . . And your friends will be properly astonished to see you 
laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, "Yes, the stars 
always make me laugh!" And they will think you are crazy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery in "The Little Prince" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, 43, says he caught the flying bug while reading "The Little Prince" 
in the third grade. He still loves the book and gives away copies to friends. 
He even calls one of his three dogs Saint-Exupery. The passage captures 
Sherman's spirit, but it's off in one respect: His friends would not be 
astonished to see him laughing as he looked skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the only person I ever met who learned to fly at night," David 
Weininger, Sherman's best friend, says approvingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The two became friends after meeting at the University of Rochester in central 
New York. Sherman, describing Weininger, may as well be describing himself: "He 
likes to fly. He likes to look at the stars. And he is very simple about life." 
</P>
<P>
 One day this summer, weeks before leaving for Bogota, Sherman stood on a 
runway at Santa Monica Airport, where he had been giving rides to teen-agers in 
an open cockpit biplane as part of the Young Eagles youth aviation program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flying is extraordinarily romantic," Sherman said, wearing a brown leather 
bomber jacket, his head and face covered by goggles and a World War I-era 
flying cap. "When you are out over the Pacific, and the sun is low in the sky, 
and you are cruising along at 2,500 feet, and the wind is in your face. . . . 
Well, I mean, what's better than that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling flights to the Arctic Circle and throughout North America, he adds: 
"There is nothing like standing on the runway right before dawn, getting ready 
to get into the airplane to go to Vancouver or Anchorage or Aspen or Mexico or 
even San Bernardino. A runway is that kind of magic door." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica's Museum of Flying, which loaned Sherman the biplane, figured in 
both the courtship of and marriage to his wife, Sandi, a real estate attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 She met her future husband while he was negotiating the purchase of the home 
they now live in, with 5-month-old son Max, atop Kenter Canyon in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, who had been married briefly during his surgical residency in San 
Francisco, offered her a helicopter ride. She passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something she absolutely didn't want to do," Sherman says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sandi, a volunteer for a group called Caring for Babies With AIDS, 
remembered the offer and called one day to ask if she could bring some children 
to the airport for a tour. 
</P>
<P>
 They began dating and were married at the Museum of Flying in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not thrilled by her husband's flying, Sandi Sherman accepts it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met when we were both sort of established. This was like a package deal," 
she says, gesturing to her husband and the sky. "The flying makes me nervous, 
but at the same time Randy loves it. How do you take that away from him?" 
</P>
<P>
 When they were dating, Sandi remembers that her future husband, juggling 
surgery, flying and volunteer work, kept falling asleep. "My friends referred 
to him as the narcoleptic microsurgeon because he only has, like, full speed or 
stop. Every time we went out, he fell asleep. He sits down, he falls asleep -- 
in movies, at dinners. I just thought he hated me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to get his pilot's license, Sherman had taken flying lessons after 
the long shifts required by his surgical residency at UC San Francisco Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lesson, recalls Weininger, a chemist who lives in Santa Fe, N.M., 
Sherman would sometimes play piano in a Haight-Ashbury jazz club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Randy balances one stress against another. As soon as something comes up, he 
puts something else on top of it," Weininger says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Knowing that Sherman is a plastic surgeon, people can't help but wonder about 
the nose. They figure he has the resources to fix things, right, so. . . ?  
</P>
<P>
 Sherman's nose, broken repeatedly while playing football, is mashed in, 
knobby, like a prizefighter's. It also says something about his priorities, and 
sometimes causes trouble in a field long identified with cosmetic beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman once came in for a consult," he recalls. "We were almost finished 
when she looked at me, then kind of turned away and asked: 'I have only one 
question: Why don't you have your nose done?' " He laughs at the memory. "I 
said, 'I did, I had my nose done about four times on the football field.' 
Needless to say, she didn't book." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman does cosmetic surgery, but his specialty is reconstructive surgery -- 
correcting birth defects, reattaching limbs, repairing the devastation caused 
by fire, gunshots or industrial accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is this classic reaction I get when people hear my husband is a plastic 
surgeon," Sandi Sherman says. "They say, 'Oh, can he do my eyelids?' I say, 
'No, no, chop off your hand and then we'll talk.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman's march into the surgery room followed a twisting path. 
</P>
<P>
 He never knew his father, who died when Sherman was a baby. He and two older 
brothers, Andy and Farrel, were raised by their mother, Pearl. "She is an 
extraordinary woman," Sherman says. "She lost my father when she was 33. She 
was left to raise three kids, all under 5 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up, one important mentor was Dr. Bernard Jaffe, the physician for 
Sherman's Clayton, Mo., high school football team. Now vice chairman of surgery 
at Tulane University Medical School, Jaffe helped Sherman through knee 
surgeries and broken noses. He became a role model and surrogate father. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love each other a lot," Sherman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning down football scholarships to two Big Eight Conference schools, 
Sherman chose the small but academically demanding University of Rochester, 
Jaffe's alma mater. There, he gained distinction as the barefooted punter who 
performed in frigid temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years at the University of Missouri Medical School, Sherman became 
restless and left. This was in the early 1970s, a prime time for what Sherman 
calls his "hippie phase." He joined a commune on the banks of the Missouri 
River, lived in a tent and learned to make pottery. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was going through growing pains," Jaffe recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months, and without admonishments from Jaffe, Sherman's interest in 
medicine returned. 
</P>
<P>
 At USC University Hospital, he heads the team of highly specialized 
microvascular surgeons who earlier this year performed the rare surgical feat 
of reattaching the scalp of a young woman, Patsy Bogle, who had been hurt in an 
industrial accident. Sherman oversees a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week countywide 
"replantation hot line," which offers emergency services to people who lose 
limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his professional accomplishments, and the humanitarian award he 
received this year from the California Medical Center, Sherman believes he 
faces an uncertain future. For one thing, he wonders whether surgeons like him 
will have a place in the rapidly evolving world of medicine and managed care. 
Already, the third-party second-guessing of his treatment plans -- by insurance 
companies mostly -- infuriates him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You train doctors for nine years to know how to treat people and then you 
start having administrators tell them what tests they can order and can't 
order, what procedures they can and can't do," he says. "I am seeing the 
deterioration of something that I hold dear, which is the quality of what I 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 As a player in academic medicine, he spends much of his time overseeing the 
education of young plastic surgeons, lecturing at conferences and seminars all 
over North America, writing papers, helping to edit peer-review journals. But 
capturing a spot on the academic fast-track and keeping it can be tricky. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, academic medicine, he believes, is something "you can't hold on to 
forever." One day you may wake up and find "everybody is moving one way and 
you're moving the other," Sherman says, and then "it's time to get out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman brought those concerns with him to Bogota, but he was soon too busy to 
dwell on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of the trip is the simplicity of the Operation Smile mission: to 
take care of children, each badly in need, one after the other, from sunrise to 
nightfall. He finds the rewards immediate and profound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where else in the world can you go and do an operation, do anything for a 
person, and change them so dramatically, so drastically, so graphically?" asks 
Sherman, who stayed with a contingent of volunteers at a Spartan but supremely 
peaceful convent-turned-hotel run by the Sisters of the Poor. "The bottom line 
is, you help children. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the vision of Dr. Bill Magee, a Norfolk, Va., plastic surgeon who 
co-founded Operation Smile with his wife, Kathy, in 1982. Reflecting on the 
motivation for moving 4,100 pounds of medical equipment and more than 35 
surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists and others to Bogota, Magee offers the case 
of one of his first patients, a 35-year-old man with a hideously deformed 
mouth. "Try to imagine living 35 years of your life and never feeling the 
gentleness of a kiss," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day before Sherman is to leave, two things stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Maicol Diaz comes back for a follow-up examination. The lip is healing 
perfectly and looks great. There are smiles all around. " Bien, bien, " 
Maicol's father says. "With the operation and all your help, he will go back to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 The second involves the worst case Sherman comes across on this trip. Juan 
Vargas, 8, was in a Bogota factory looking for his father when a heavy 
automatic door closed on his foot. It was crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman meets the boy on Sunday evening, five weeks after the accident. The 
local doctors had just covered the wound and left it, hoping the microsurgeon 
due soon from Los Angeles would have some answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman is appalled by what he sees. The boy, lying on a cot in a six-bed 
ward, is in such intense pain that he cries out in agony even as doctors reach 
down to take off his bandage. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, having decided to put the boy under anesthetic before looking at 
the wound, Sherman finds the foot badly infected. A significant part of it is 
simply gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman is confronted with two options, neither of which he finds attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 One is to attempt a complicated surgery known as a "free flap," in which 
muscle and tissue taken from the boy's shoulder and thigh would be attached to 
the missing part of the foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 What troubles him is that, even if the proposed operation is successful, Juan 
would require follow-up surgeries, including complex bone grafts. Remembering 
the neglected state he found the boy in, Sherman has serious doubts that Juan 
would get the care. 
</P>
<P>
 Option two is to amputate part of the foot, with enough remaining so that Juan 
could walk freely. Sherman thinks this might be the cleanest, most humane thing 
to do. "He'd be back on his feet in no time and would never have to come to the 
hospital again," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is decided to try to save Juan's whole foot. Sherman works for 3 1/2 
hours, with the help of a Bogota surgical resident. Medical students peer over 
his shoulder, watching the meticulous microsurgery unfold. The sewing up of 
veins and arteries requires a high-powered surgical microscope. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the operation is over, Sherman spends several tense hours wondering 
whether the graft will take. 
</P>
<P>
 Around nightfall he holds a Doppler, a highly sensitive listening device, to 
the gauze-wrapped area just above Juan's foot. Suddenly, Sherman hears a 
rhythmic "whoosh, whoosh, whoosh." 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor smiles broadly. "That's a great pulse," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking down the hall, free to relax after 12 grueling hours, the squealing 
babies, concerned parents, language problems and little crises behind him, 
Sherman is a happy, contented man. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always surprises me how well things turn out in the midst of all this 
chaos," he says. Dr. Randy Sherman 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: No; born in Clayton, Mo., now lives in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married for two years to Sandi Sherman, with whom he has a 5-month-old 
son, Max. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Family, flying, medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 On becoming a surgeon: "The demands put on you are physical, intellectual, 
psychological, and they are unrelenting. There is never really a down time. 
People are always evaluating you, everything you do gets a mark, and just when 
you think you have it mastered, you get pushed up to the next level. That goes 
on year after year after year." 
</P>
<P>
 On the appeal of flying: "For a driven individual, it's the perfect kind of 
hobby, because you can always improve your skills, you can always improve your 
proficiency, you can always get more into it. It's not the kind of hobby that 
you can say, 'OK, I've mastered this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On being raised by his widowed mother: "I never acutely felt the loss of a 
father, which means my mother was doing double duty. She was incredibly 
compassionate. You could just tell that she would never let you down. Never. I 
probably was used to every third night on call at the hospital, because I had 
every third night on call with the dishes since I was 5."

 The photographer missed the significance of the Idfu Temple ("My Best Shot," 
Aug. 21). It is a fine temple to the Egyptian god Horus with its famous granite 
falcon-god guarding the entrance. Horus was the son of Osiris and Isis and had 
a wife named Hathor who made an annual voyage from her temple in Dendora to 
Idfu to reunite with her husband.

ADMIRING AUVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like Philip Brooker ("Impressions of Van Gogh," Aug. 21), my daughter and I 
made the pilgrimage to Auvers. Unlike Brooker, we were almost the only tourists 
in town on a drizzly Tuesday in April.Readers may wish to consult Patty Lurie's 
excellent "A Guide to the Impressionist Landscape: Day Trips From Paris" 
(Bulfinch Press, $16.95), which provides details on visiting a number of the 
favorite haunts of the French Impressionists.

<P>
 My husband and I walked every inch of Auvers last April and not a tourist was 
in sight. Van Gogh was the main reason for our trek, but the golden stone 
cottages and white lace curtains fluttering from each window afforded ingenious 
looks at other artists as well. Positioned along the way are posters of 
Pissarro, Cezanne, Corot, etc. on the spots where the paintings were executed. 
</P>
<P>
 We managed to get lost, in spite of the help of local farmers. Vincent's field 
-- so open and desolate and with such a heartbreaking history -- gives one an 
eerie feeling. He is said to have described the immense stretches of wheat and 
troubled skies as having inspired him to express sorrow and solitude. Walking 
miles out of our way gave us an opportunity to bond with Vincent's experience 
in his immortal field. One of the reasons -- unforgettable -- that some of us 
travel.

DANA PARSONS: LATEST CASUALTY SPURS TROOPS IN WAR AGAINST CHILD ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Ann Xavier grimaced when she saw the article in the paper Friday about 
the 10-year-old boy from Orange who had been sexually abused with a miniature 
baseball bat and had his tongue burned with a hot knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, God, she thought, we're probably going to get him. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier works at Florence Crittenton Services of Orange County, a residential 
treatment center for about 200 youngsters. It's the kind of place where you 
don't want new customers, because they're mostly youngsters who have been 
abused. The 10-year-old who made the papers Friday, said to be the victim of 
longstanding abuse or neglect and apparently needing ongoing medical attention, 
is but another grim reminder that adults continue doing horrible things to 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Friday, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez had been listening for two hours 
to KFI, as callers to a radio show flooded the lines to deplore the 
10-year-old's plight. Even with a public already aware of child abuse, the 
sickening nature of the 10-year-old's case hit a nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outrageous," Vasquez said, "and yet it's a tremendous wake-up call that 
we have a lot of work to do yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier was among a group of people who, with much fanfare, spearheaded last 
year's inaugural Orange County Children's Summit. For the first time, summit 
leaders said, there would be coordination. No more duplication of services; no 
more bureaucratic tie-ups; no more lack of communication between jurisdictions 
or agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The group never said it would make problems disappear in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But a year later, with the dreadfulness of the 10-year-old's situation in the 
headlines, the question is whether this is a battle that can ever be won. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a question I put to several summit leaders. To my surprise, none was 
discouraged by the efforts of the past year. All see the war as huge but 
winnable. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Parrish, vice chairman of the new umbrella group known as the Orange 
County Partnership for Children, said: "We have tremendous work to do as a 
community. Our infrastructure of family and community relations and sense of 
community really have been beaten down. That took a long time, and it's going 
to be a long time coming back, but every inch in progress will be noticeable. 
It's about building families back up and building relationships in 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Caine has been doing community social work for the past 30 years. In recent 
months, she's concentrated on gang prevention in Fullerton. Referring to the 
10-year-old's case, Caine said, "I don't know why I'm constantly amazed that 
someone can treat kids that way." Yet, she said, it isn't enough to discourage 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you this," Caine said, "my life is too full for me to feel I can 
waste my time on something I don't feel can be accomplished. We don't think 
we're God and can take care of all problems, but I feel if we keep our sights 
on the mission of trying to make things better for kids, we will make some 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's summit, to be held Saturday at Orange Coast College, will focus on 
individual community involvement rather than countywide efforts, she said. "I 
think we tried to take too big a step last year," Mary Ann Xavier said. "We're 
kind of backing away from the broader picture, because that jump was too far." 
</P>
<P>
 What's exciting, Xavier said, is the increased involvement of youngsters this 
year. "It's really neat when you sit down at a meeting with these kids. They're 
so damn bright and good at cutting to the heart of things." 
</P>
<P>
 What summit leaders want -- what we all want -- is some good news from the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably in November, there will at least be some news. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the target date, Vasquez said, for the county's second annual report on 
a wide range of "indicators" in such key areas as teen pregnancies, child 
abuse, violence and school dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
 While not daring to predict whether the numbers will offer hope, Vasquez said 
he's buoyed by greater cooperation of agencies and increased public awareness 
in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough, but that falls on deaf ears to the public. It wants some signal 
that we're moving toward a society where 10-year-olds aren't abused. 
</P>
<P>
 As a reserve police officer who still pulls an occasional patrol shift, 
Vasquez has answered domestic violence and abuse calls. 
</P>
<P>
 It's why he conceded that the problems kids face can seem overwhelming to 
solve. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some respects, yes, because I go out there and see conditions children are 
living under and then go back in on Monday and I'm a county supervisor, and it 
is a very emotional thing, because you want to do better. You know the problems 
are out there, and sometimes it's really tough to translate what you see into 
strategies that will work."

ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Volunteers Needed--The Sea and Sage Audubon Society is looking for a few good 
men and women to assist with outdoor educational programs at San Joaquin 
Wildlife Sanctuary in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer naturalists will assist groups of 12 to 16 grade-school children 
with identification of birds and pond life during two-hour tours of the 
wetlands.Skills needed include a love for the environment, enthusiasm and a 
basic knowledge of birds and plants. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't necessary to be an expert naturalist to volunteer. In fact, Sea and 
Sage is offering a training program to help all volunteers become familiar with 
the flora and fauna of the wildlife sanctuary. Topics covered in the training 
sessions include wetlands, water, pond species, bird identification and biology 
and outdoor education skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are expected to commit to leading or assisting with a minimum of 
two tours per month during the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 To sign up, contact Sea and Sage at (714) 261-7963. Leave your name, phone 
number and mailing address. There is a $15 fee to cover the cost of a training 
manual and other materials. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Got More Free Time? The Audubon House will have an orientation for anyone 
interested in volunteering on Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. The facility serves as an 
educational outlet, featuring programs, exhibits and a small in-house library. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a variety of duties to be filled at this chapter of the Audubon 
Society. It is not necessary to be an experienced birder to work at the site.  
</P>
<P>
 The Audubon House is at 3512 Michelson Drive, on property owned by the Irvine 
Ranch Water District offices. Generally, the house is open from 8 a.m. to 4 
p.m. daily.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON CURFEWS; RESTRICTIONS ON YOUTHS STRAIN 
FAMILIES, BURDEN GOVERNMENT; TWO QUESTIONS ON SUCH LAWS FOR JUVENILES: ARE THEY 
CONSTITUTIONAL? ARE THEY WISE? THEY SEEM TO BE NEITHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARNOLD BINDER, Arnold Binder is a professor in the School of Social Ecology 
at UC Irvine and is an expert in the field of juvenile delinquency. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be difficult to argue against the proposition that a youth, say of 14 
years, should not be on the streets between such hours as 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., 
except under extraordinary circumstances. One could not readily imagine, 
excepting those circumstances, that he or she would be up to any good, 
especially given the typical behavioral excesses expected of youths these days. 
Add to that the experiences in several cities, most dramatically Detroit, 
Newark and Atlanta over recent years, of crime on the part of youngsters during 
such night hours, and the thought of imposing curfew restrictions becomes 
understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 There has indeed been an increase in such thoughts and resulting enactments in 
recent decades, and quite noticeably in Orange County. But, it is worth noting, 
the use of laws to restrict movement on the streets at night is centuries old. 
It has been estimated, for example, that there were about 3,000 cities and 
towns in the United States with curfew ordinances for juveniles by the end of 
the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 California state law says that a youth who violates an ordinance "establishing 
a curfew based solely on age" is a status, not a criminal, offender, meaning 
that he or she is in the same legal class as a habitual truant or one who 
refuses to obey the orders of parents or school authorities. While a status 
offender may be made a ward of the juvenile court, the state's Welfare and 
Institutions Code greatly restricts the alternatives available for dealing with 
a ward in that class. It specifies that a status offender may not be detained 
in such secure facilities as juvenile halls beyond the periods (no more than 72 
hours) necessary to return the child to parent or guardian. Moreover, the 
alternative of commitment to a juvenile home, camp or hall is available only to 
wards who have committed criminal type offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Two questions stand out in evaluating juvenile curfew laws: Are they 
constitutional and are they wise? Courts and legal scholars remain divided on 
the issue of constitutionality. The first federal case dealing with that issue 
led to a decision upholding a curfew ordinance, but many state courts and other 
federal courts have reported conclusions conflicting with that one. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, the question of constitutionality was debated in a 1994 issue 
of the American Bar Assn.; one attorney argued that such ordinances are 
intrinsically unconstitutional, while the other argued that it is possible to 
craft a constitutionally acceptable law. But even the latter attorney conceded 
that freedom of movement, including that of youngsters, is a fundamental right 
("of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty" in the words of two 
prominent former members of the U.S. Supreme Court) that may be restricted by 
curfew ordinances only if they are "narrowly drawn" to further a "compelling 
state interest." The implication is that the ordinance must specify a critical 
governmental goal and carefully exclude from coverage those kinds of actions by 
juveniles that have no relationship to achievement of that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, it would seem that if, for example, the critical goal is reduction of 
juvenile crime, there would be no basis for considering the following a 
violation of a curfew ordinance: A child of 16 who has never in the remotest 
shown either criminal behavior or gang affiliation is on the street where he or 
she lives during the forbidden night period. Yet, on testimony of my daughter, 
there has been harassment of her friends by the police as they moved, after the 
cutoff for curfew onset, between their cars and their houses. And, according to 
the same testimony, the police have not always been cordial, or even courteous, 
in their approaches. My reference, I emphasize, is to girls with impeccably 
proper manners and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the wisdom of such ordinances? The often stated reasons for passing 
such ordinances are: strengthen parental control of children; protect young 
people from the dangers of the streets at night, and protect the public from 
the risks of juvenile crime and mischief. (The unstated reasons are: We people 
in political office will show our constituents that we're tough on crime, and 
if the parents can't control those little monsters, we'll do it for them). 
First, it is quite impossible for me to imagine how taking direct control away 
from parents strengthens their control. Second, if the danger perceived for the 
child at night on the streets is physical, then it would seem that even more 
strenuous efforts should be directed at keeping the more vulnerable elderly and 
disabled off the nocturnal streets. If juvenile vulnerability is considered 
mental in the sense of the danger of being exposed to emotional trauma, it is 
unclear why that likelihood is assumed to be greater at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is no evidence that nocturnal curfews reduce incidents of 
juvenile crime. In fact, informal study after the enactment of a juvenile 
curfew ordinance in Detroit indicated that, while there resulted a decrease in 
juvenile crime during the curfew hours, the overall incidence of such crime 
actually went up. That would indicate time displacement. 
</P>
<P>
 There does remain the clear gain that youths who are restricted to the indoors 
after a certain hour cannot be nuisances, whether mischievous or not, to the 
adults who are outdoors. But at what price? The vast array of children on our 
streets, night and day, are your children and mine whose major offenses against 
society may be of the order of disobedience or sneaking a sip of wine. We want 
those children to have warm, friendly feelings toward the police and that, I am 
assured by my daughter, does not come about from harassment based on trivial 
infractions or, worse, misjudgment on the part of the police. 
</P>
<P>
 A second negative effect of curfew laws is in terms of cost and where the 
resources of the justice system should be expended. 
</P>
<P>
 To take a child into police custody, refer him or her to the probation 
department, have a juvenile court hearing, make the child a ward of the court, 
and then carry out one or more of the limited treatment alternatives available 
to the court for status offenders is a very expensive process. Since the 
resources of the justice system are severely limited as it is, expenditures to 
enforce curfew laws in that fashion must limit efforts to control juvenile 
criminal behavior, some of which is violent indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 As pointed out in a recent Times article, the mayor of Mission Viejo has 
contended, in a letter to the district attorney, that the juvenile court was 
routinely dismissing curfew referrals from that city.  
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile court judge denied that allegation, in very strong terms. It is 
my opinion that, except where there are most unusual complicating factors, all 
such referrals should routinely be dismissed, whether coming from Mission 
Viejo, Huntington Beach, or some other city. 
</P>
<P>
 Better still, where a city insists on a juvenile curfew ordinance, and it is 
not successfully challenged on constitutional grounds, all resulting cases 
should be handled informally at the police level.  
</P>
<P>
 The justice system has vastly more important matters to occupy its time and 
ensure its most limited resources.

FROM DISASTER, MAGIC AT SIX FLAGS; AMUSEMENT PARK'S RECORD ATTENDANCE, 
EXPANSION PLANS A BRIGHT SPOT FOR THE REGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia figured to suffer greatly from the 
effects of the Northridge quake, as have so many other businesses in the San 
Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. For one thing, its main customer artery, 
the Golden State Freeway, was severed and shut down on the day of the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the freeway was repaired in record time, and we suppose that the need to 
be entertained and escape one's troubles is even greater after such an enormous 
natural disaster. It is also likely that the baseball strike, which prevented 
people from watching the Dodgers and the Angels, helped as well. 
</P>
<P>
 We are happy to report that those unfortunate factors have combined to boost 
Six Flags Magic Mountain to what figures to be a record season for attendance. 
That is a noteworthy development for a Southern California region hungry for 
positive economic signs. What's even better, however, is what this 
record-setting season has spawned. 
</P>
<P>
 As Times reporter David Wharton recently noted, a planned expansion of the 
amusement park that could add hundreds of jobs and millions in additional 
tourist dollars has been stuck on the drawing board for a decade. No more. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpectedly high attendance in a year that involved the costliest natural 
disaster in U.S. history has persuaded Six Flags Entertainment officials to go 
ahead and build a new 14-acre water park that will be opened next summer. The 
speed with which the Golden State Freeway was reopened was also credited. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very impressed with how quickly the state acted," said Bob Pittman, 
chairman of Six Flags Entertainment, adding that "the time was right" to go 
ahead with the expansion. That comes as very welcome news in an area still 
reeling from the lingering recession, the earthquake and defense industry 
cutbacks and consolidations.

BREAK THE GRIDLOCK ON MASS TRANSIT FOR VALLEY; DECISIVE ACTION AND ACCORD ON 
RED LINE EXTENSION ARE VITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We're not sure what the record is for the total number of studies and reports 
written for an unbuilt and unfunded mass transit line. Unfortunately, we're 
beginning to believe that the pile of paperwork for the Red Line extension 
across the San Fernando Valley must be in the running. 
</P>
<P>
 If you care about finding solutions for freeway traffic jams and surface 
street gridlock in the Valley, then you know exactly what we are referring to. 
If you don't care, and don't know, you should. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, a bitter debate has raged over where and how the Red Line 
would be built. Unless a decision is reached soon, it will be time to pose two 
other questions: when it will be built, and if it will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the dispute are the stalwart proponents of an above-ground rail 
system that would follow the path of the median of the Ventura Freeway. That 
option might involve a monorail system, but that has not been determined. On 
the other side of the debate are the equally intransigent supporters of a 
subway line under Chandler and Burbank boulevards. The Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority is due to make a decision on this matter before the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when we first offered an opinion on the Valley Red Line, the cost 
differences between the two options were relatively large: $3.03 billion for 
the subway, and $2.59 billion for the freeway. We suggested a compromise 
between the two options: extending the subway to the 405 Freeway, and studying 
the feasibility of an above-ground or monorail option for the rest of the route 
into the west Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, another cost analysis of the two options has been completed, one that 
takes new technology and recession-reduced real estate prices into 
consideration and thankfully shaves hundreds of millions of dollars off the 
price tag for both. The latest information suggests that savings is much less 
of a factor in the debate. The cost of going underground is now at $2.27 
billion, while the freeway route figures to run about $2.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 We were pleased to note the release of the cost-comparison analysis. We were 
not pleased by the response to the report, but we should have anticipated it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very glad that the (freeway route's) cost savings have been verified," 
said county supervisor and MTA member Mike Antonovich, as if that savings had 
not been whittled down to a difference of less than 1%. Meanwhile, the subway's 
proponents acted as though cost was the only factor in the forthcoming 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 We are left with two main concerns. One is that the 13-member MTA come up with 
a decisive and final vote on the matter, and soon. And Valley residents must 
try to accept that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not sure how realistic that is. Opinions run deep, as suggested by the 
fact that homeowner associations opposed to the freeway route were putting out 
mailings to as many as 17,000 people earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is certain, however. If both sides in this debate are so firmly 
entrenched that they are prepared to delay matters further with legal action, 
then the chances of any line being built are going to be reduced. The news has 
been filled with such warnings of late. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit strike, for example, was an indication of how complicated and 
vulnerable our region's mass transit system is to factors that go far beyond 
the route of one line, however important it might be. The unexpected blocking, 
by a federal judge, of the MTA bus fare increase also exposed the possibilities 
of funding problems that were already precarious because of the recession, 
declining fare-box revenues, and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 How much attention do you think the Valley's Red Line extension will receive 
if the matter of its route is still being contested, in some way or another, 
into 1995 and beyond?

PRESCHOOL'S ONLY FAULT WAS CARING; CHURCH'S VIEW OF CHILD CARE LEADS TO 
EVICTION OF SANTA CLARITA VALLEY LEARNING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Rooms Wanted. Occasionally boisterous tenant (except during nap time)."  
</P>
<P>
 Just such an ad might be seen in the classified sections by the end of next 
year, unless someone or some group is willing to offer sufficient space and 
hospitality to the Santa Clarita Valley Learning Center. This preschool/ 
day-care center is being evicted by the Placerita church from which it has 
leased space for the past three years. It is being evicted for being exactly 
what it is . . . a preschool that has a secondary role as a day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The responsibility for the care of children from the biblical mandate is very 
clear, and that is that it belongs to the family," said the chairman of the 
all-male Baptist church committee that decided against renewing the Learning 
Center's lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman added that the church is seeking a new pastor and was afraid of 
being rejected by likely applicants because "there are men . . . who would not 
be able to accept the pulpit at this church because of the preschool." 
</P>
<P>
 This means that the church feels that the children ought to be at home with 
one of their parents. We wonder how they feel about pre-kindergarten, 
kindergarten and other early elementary school classes since those too amount 
to the kind of third-party child care to which the church seems to object. 
</P>
<P>
 We should note here that the 1.5-million-member Baptist churches in the United 
States adopted a resolution five years ago that presents a far different 
stance, encouraging church-run day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the Placerita church is within its rights as to whether it will 
lease its free space to some group or organization. But Santa Clarita's needs 
-- and the nation's -- have moved sharply in the opposite direction. Finding 
reputable child-care options in Santa Clarita is quite difficult for the many 
working parents there, and most licensed programs have long waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in stable, two-parent households, the American Dream now requires two 
wage earners. Moreover, about 60% of all women with children age 5 and under 
now work outside the home, as do 80% of the mothers of older children. The U.S. 
Census Bureau also reports that the conventional model of American family life 
-- a married couple with children and a stable home -- is on the verge of 
becoming the exception rather than the rule. And one out of every four children 
now lives with a single parent. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the reality, and day-care and preschool options have never been more 
important as a result. The Santa Clarita Valley Learning Center fulfills such a 
role, and it deserves a landlord that understands that need. Any takers?

CLAYTON MOORE IS A REAL-LIFE HERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Congratulations to Frank Manning, who wrote such a wonderful article (Sept. 
15) on the Lone Ranger. Clayton Moore is indeed a hero, not only 
internationally, but to our local community as well. 
</P>
<P>
 I met him in the late 1970s when he dramatically rescued my daughter's 
friends, the Reifler twins. The girls were only 7 years old, but had decided 
that they were capable of handling a boat. Without anyone's knowledge the two 
had untied their rubber raft from its mooring and launched it on Calabasas 
Lake. The fun turned to panic when they became becalmed and stranded. They 
called out repeatedly for help, and soon there was a man swimming strongly 
toward them who towed them back to shore. He rode away before he could be 
thanked. 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote for the local Enterprise newspaper at that time, and the mother of my 
daughter's friends asked me to put out an article requesting that the 
mysterious stranger please identify himself so that they could express their 
appreciation. I subsequently heard the ever-familiar, husky tones of the Lone 
Ranger over the telephone introducing himself as the gentleman involved. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the beginning of our family's friendship, and the continuation of our 
longtime respect and fondness for the hero that is the epitome of what is noble 
in our city of Calabasas, whose motto is appropriately "The Last of the Old 
West."

LET LENDERS BUY THEIR OWN HOME INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The recent article by Jill Bettner titled "Candidates Side With 
Policyholders," (Aug. 28) was interesting and informative. The concept that the 
banks and mortgage companies have the right to protect their financial 
interests in quake-damaged properties that are used to secure their loans is 
sound enough.What is unsound is that the lending institutions expect the 
homeowners to pay not only for their own protection but also for the protection 
of these same lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider a homeowner who puts 20% down on his home. He is forced (in order to 
obtain the loan) to pay the entire premium for insurance to protect not only 
himself, but in much greater degree the lending institution. Why should we be 
forced to pay for their protection?  
</P>
<P>
 If the banks and mortgage companies want to be protected against abandonment 
of property -- a laudable goal -- then let them purchase abandonment of 
property insurance and let them pay the premiums for it themselves!

3 ARCTIC TRAVELERS TOOK WAYWARD ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I keep asking myself why you squandered at least half a page on "Trio Takes 
Hard Road to the Arctic Circle" (Aug. 30). A better question is why your writer 
thought the antics of these three irresponsible men warranted an article in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Californians drive the Alaska Highway every year. Most of these 
travelers do not careen off the side of the road endangering themselves or 
others. It was an interesting angle to suggest that these three were modern 
adventurers, but a little research would have revealed the folly in that 
notion. Twenty-five years ago the roads were bad, horrible even in spots. 
Today, most of the highway and its connector roads are paved or are 
well-maintained gravel. Westwood Boulevard is far worse. Drivers who obey the 
speed limits don't have a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 This year was my family's sixth trek to Alaska. Four years ago, my husband and 
I also drove the pipeline road to the 66th parallel and the Arctic Circle. But 
unlike the men you would like to portray as heroic merely because they arrived 
somewhere, we spent time appreciating and experiencing the countryside around 
us. Your article was not an account of a journey made but a feeble pitch for a 
high-concept B movie.

BRAUDE'S FOCUS IS ON WESTSIDE, NOT VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It was very gratifying to read in The Times about Councilman Marvin Braude's 
tireless efforts to maintain the appearance and the quality of the buildings, 
stores and signs on San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the councilman's zeal does not extend to another part of his 
constituency -- Ventura Boulevard in Encino.Apparently, he is not offended by 
Adray's architecture or signing. And the building of a Burger King on Ventura 
Boulevard likewise hasn't troubled him a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Braude lives in Pacific Palisades, not the Valley, and his primary 
interests are on the other side of the hill. He was conspicuously silent last 
summer when Valley homeowners were up in arms over exorbitant water bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The present councilmanic districts deprive the Valley of true representation 
in Los Angeles government. We will only get true representative government when 
the Valley becomes a separate city. Otherwise, we will continue to be treated 
as second-class citizens.

TIMES WASTES SPACE ON CIGAR SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * What is it with The Times these days? For the second week in a row, I've 
read an article glorifying cigar smoking (the most recent one written by my 
North Hills neighbor Stan Sellers on Sept. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 As an asthmatic and a staunch anti-smoking proponent, I detest stinky stogies 
even more than cigarettes! As a psychologist, I recognize cigar smoking for 
what it really is, just another addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a poor sign of The Times when you decide to devote a half a page to such 
a destructive "hobby." 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how many people (including kids) reading that article will run out 
and buy stogies because it's "cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers is right about his new hobby. It is breathtaking!

CUT THROUGH THE SMOKESCREEN AROUND BEILENSON, SYBERT CAMP URGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I strongly suggest that Marc Litchman have third thoughts about conventional 
wisdom. His piece "Second Thoughts About Conventional Wisdom" (Valley 
Commentary, Sept. 11) shows little of what one might expect of a political 
consultant and a lot of what would come from someone on Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 He needs to go beyond his "second thoughts" in these areas: 
</P>
<P>
 * The race in the 24th Congressional District is not about the relative 
numbers of Republicans and Democrats. It is about whether Rich Sybert or Mr. 
Beilenson more accurately represents the views of the residents of the 
district. Since Mr. Beilenson was gerrymandered into "representing" Thousand 
Oaks, his typical tax-and-spend liberal votes have convincingly demonstrated 
his lack of appreciation for how the voters at the west end of the district 
want to be represented in Washington. Party labels have very little to do with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 * He's right. There is no solid "Reagan coalition" any more. The whole 
population has swung decidedly to the right, now understanding that the 
Beilenson approach of having the central government solve all our problems does 
not, and never has, worked in this country. Most Democrats up for election are 
running as fast as they can, away from any association with that philosophy or 
with the President who clings dearly to it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mr. Sybert is not going to lose significant Republican votes because of his 
views on abortion. Most women are not "vehemently opposed" to restrictions on 
abortion, and most "hard right" folks have accepted that limited access to 
abortion will be with us for the foreseeable future -- regardless of what Mr. 
Sybert thinks about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 * If Mr. Beilenson really has been in the "forefront" of the effort to stop 
illegal immigration, it is quite obvious that his efforts have been grossly 
ineffectual. If the current state is really the best he can come up with, it's 
obviously time to give someone else a shot at it! 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, let's not talk about needing road maps for the district. Mr. 
Beilenson absolutely relies on his to find his way to Thousand Oaks, where he's 
not often seen.

 * The Sept. 11 article by Democrat consultant Marc Litchman which attacked my 
congressional campaign contained numerous factual errors and several 
out-and-out fabrications. 
</P>
<P>
 1. It is not true that I support federal restrictions on abortion. I oppose 
government involvement in such personal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 2. My opponent in this race, Anthony Beilenson, is the carpetbagger in the 
Valley, not me. I live here; Beilenson never has, and has to rent a car when he 
comes into the district. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The fact that I have spent my own money in the race merely means that I'm 
not beholden to special interests, unlike Beilenson, who raises most of his 
money from trial lawyers and from outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
 4. I want to avoid partisan politics, but it is not true that the Republican 
Party is "fractured." I have unified support from the rank and file and from 
virtually every elected official in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Mr. Beilenson has not been a "leader on illegal immigration for 10 years." 
Rather, he has introduced bills copied from other people's positions, including 
my own. I was chief immigration analyst for Gov. Pete Wilson for three years. 
Then he has politely waited for them to die while he votes the other way. He 
opposes Proposition 187 (Save Our State), voted against requiring proof of 
citizenship for voter registration or a residency requirement for federal 
programs, and opposed a tracking center for illegal alien felons. 
</P>
<P>
 6. I think it is I who have the incumbent neutralized on environmental issues, 
not the other way around. I was environmental chairman for two statewide 
campaigns, authored the state's growth management policies and now sit as the 
Valley's public member in the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. Mr. 
Beilenson's past accomplishments are just that -- in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Finally, as far as association with Pete Wilson being a handicap, our 
latest polling shows Wilson beating his opponent by 17 percentage points in the 
24th District. And it shows me beating mine by nearly 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Litchman's article has a lot more wishful thinking than facts. Pretty clearly 
the Democrat strategists in the 24th District are getting nervous. This is the 
first time the incumbent has faced a competitive challenger in a competitive 
district. I also would not count on Mr. Beilenson moving "back" to the Valley 
when he loses.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; WHY OUR TEACHERS DON'T TRUST LEARN PROGRAM; REFORM PLAN 
COULD HELP TROUBLED PUBLIC SCHOOLS RE-CREATE THEMSELVES, BUT TEACHERS ARE 
UNDERSTANDABLY WARY OF FADDISHNESS, FINANCING AND RISKS. 
</P>

public schools.

<P>
 On those days when my enthusiasm wanes, I look at education in Los Angeles and 
feel like we're caught in an eddy spiraling downward. I feel myself being 
pulled down by the educational bureaucracy, which, while it advocates change 
and even makes some changes, remains relatively untouched. I'm afraid LEARN may 
be just another paper tiger. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a coalition of business leaders, educators and parents got together 
to determine how our schools should look as we enter the 21st Century. What the 
coalition proposed, under the title of Los Angeles Educational Assn. for Reform 
Now (LEARN), was that individual schools be given the opportunity to develop 
their own educational programs, according to the needs of the community and the 
students they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years into the program, 87 Los Angeles Unified School District schools 
have begun developing schoolwide plans, the first step in becoming a LEARN 
school. Although LEARN's director, former Assemblyman Mike Roos, said he's 
encouraged by the level of participation, the number is still 13 short of the 
100 projected for year two of the program and a far cry from the total of 
650-plus L.A. public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 This newspaper has editorially declared LEARN to be the last chance the Los 
Angeles school district has of taking control of its own destiny. The 
community, rightly or wrongly, is demanding change. If not LEARN, its advocates 
suggest, then the options will be breaking up the district or issuing vouchers. 
Given the choices, teachers should be clamoring to jump on the LEARN bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 A colleague and I brought the LEARN discussion to our school, proposing that 
we should, in Roos' words, "be in a system where we can sit at the table and 
help make the decisions, rather than have them forced on us." After a 
tumultuous six weeks during the spring semester of speeches, communiques to the 
faculty, guest speakers from the LEARN office, visits to LEARN schools and much 
heated discussion, our teachers overwhelmingly -- 65% to 35% -- voted no on 
LEARN. That killed it. It takes a 75% favorable vote among teachers to install 
LEARN. 
</P>
<P>
 Our school isn't unique. Most high school faculties in the Valley have turned 
it down or never discussed it formally at all. Even Helen Bernstein, president 
of United Teachers-Los Angeles, couldn't get the union to endorse LEARN. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the seven reasons, not in any particular order, most often given by 
teachers voting no on LEARN: 
</P>
<P>
 1. We don't trust the school district, the administrators, the superintendent 
or the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Where's the money going to come from? True, private funds were raised to 
pay for initial training, but who pays for LEARN's offices or director or 
phones and staff? Still smarting from the "temporary" 10% pay cut about to 
enter its third year, teachers shout, "Not from my pay check, it isn't!" 
</P>
<P>
 3. Nothing in the LEARN program promises lower class size, money for supplies, 
computers and more classrooms. You can only move resources around. My 
colleagues promise that even without any other education reform, they could do 
miracles if all classes were limited to 20 students and every class had at 
least one computer. 
</P>
<P>
 4. LEARN is just another faddish project. My more experienced colleagues 
assure me that if we wait around long enough, it too will pass. 
</P>
<P>
 5. At every step to organizing a LEARN school, teachers are expected to 
volunteer their time to serve on a seemingly endless round of committees tacked 
on to a job that is universally acknowledged to be among the most stressful. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Teachers are not risk-takers. We know what we have now. If we change it, 
things may be worse. 
</P>
<P>
 7. LEARN gives final control to the principal. The teachers union fought long 
and hard to protect teachers from vindictive principals; teachers are not 
willingly going to give back those protections. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand how the teachers feel. I even agree with them on some points. 
Still, I voted for LEARN and am sorry it lost. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't agree with the severest critics of the public schools. What we're 
doing now isn't terrible. Kids who come to school every day do get an 
education, they do graduate and they do go on to jobs and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, for many students -- and teachers -- school isn't the 
exciting, dynamic, challenging place it could be. LEARN is no panacea, but it 
gives a school a chance to re-create itself.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; A RISKY PATH FOR PIERCE COLLEGE; A SKETCHY PROPOSAL BRINGS 
COMMERCIALISM TO AN INSTITUTION WORTHY OF BETTER PUBLIC FUNDING. BUT IT MAY BE 
THE FINANCIALLY STRETCHED COLLEGE'S LAST BEST HOPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LES BOSTON, Les Boston is a free-lance writer and editor and a former 
English teacher at Valley College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College has its problems and now boasts the beginnings of a plan to 
address them. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems are well-known: Budget cuts have slashed programs; students can't 
get classes needed for graduation; facilities are run down, and enrollment has 
dropped -- which means still less money for the college. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is less well-known and still in the formative stages. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Mary Lee was transferred from Valley College to be acting president 
at Pierce and began to work with faculty, staff, administrators, homeowners, 
business organizations and elected officials to develop a master plan for the 
school. An early version was presented to the board of trustees of the Los 
Angeles Community College District at the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plan so far exists only as an outline. Nothing has been published. One 
cannot examine projects or construction in terms of operations or costs. I was 
given the slide presentation that trustees saw and a tour of the campus and the 
college's farm. The plan is certainly ambitious, but I am troubled by the 
thought of turning a large part the school into a commercial venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lee works from the premise that Pierce will never be adequately funded by 
the state and will have to raise its own money from private sources and 
revenue-producing activities, with perhaps some local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to commercial enterprises on campus, success would require 
extensive community involvement and volunteer services ranging from conducting 
campus tours to designing new structures. It is assumed that only that 
combination can prevent the sale of many acres and further damage to the 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 The school will try to gain revenue in several ways: 
</P>
<P>
 * Profits will come from a golf driving range and a movie theater developed 
and operated by private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Facilities such as a community service center designed for conventions and 
an enlarged stadium would be used for the instructional program but could also 
be rented to businesses, community organizations and institutions. (Cicero 
Farms would continue to lease a corner of the farm.) 
</P>
<P>
 * A fitness center, an equestrian center with riding trails and walking and 
jogging trails would be used for instruction and would charge fees to community 
users. 
</P>
<P>
 Is such an approach compatible with a public college? 
</P>
<P>
 I prefer to begin with the premise that community colleges pay for themselves 
and should be fully funded because people with even one year of higher 
education are more likely to be employed, to earn more, spend more and pay more 
taxes than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleges with programs in agriculture benefit California's $18-billion farming 
industry so directly that significant support should come from agribusiness, as 
it often does. With appropriate funding, Pierce could devote all time and 
energy to improving instruction rather than to writing and enforcing contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of instruction, my first concern was for the farm and agricultural 
program, but I was assured that none of the farmland would be lost. I was 
relieved that the intent is to preserve that wonderful natural resource against 
those who would cover all ground with concrete and to protect needed 
agriculture programs from those who haven't observed the startling advances in 
plant science, animal science, food science, soil and water conservation and 
pest control. 
</P>
<P>
 A new health sciences building, a learning resource center and a student 
services center are expected to make the academic program more effective and 
the campus more appealing. A children's science museum, a farm museum and a 
natural history museum would be used for college instruction, for tours by 
elementary and secondary students and for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 All those developments along with changes in the scheduling of classes are 
designed to address the problems of declining enrollment and deteriorating 
facilities. Such projects should indeed make the degree and certificate 
programs stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 Corollary purposes are to put the college, with its unique farm, among sites 
recommended to tourists by the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Center and 
to attract leasing by motion picture production companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the results come? The approach is pragmatic if not visionary; the plan 
seems workable but difficult. Given today's budgetary realities, there may be 
no other way. And all revenues would have to be used only at the college. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce and the farm are too valuable an asset to the San Fernando Valley and 
metropolitan Los Angeles to lose. Pierce's friends will be watching -- and 
hoping.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; L.A. COUNCIL MUST FILL THE VACANCY IN 5TH DISTRICT; WHEN ZEV 
YAROSLAVSKY LEAVES TO JOIN COUNTY BOARD, DISTRICT COULD BE LEFT WITHOUT A CITY 
VOICE FOR SEVEN MONTHS. BUT ITS NEEDS REQUIRE AN INTERIM REPLACEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAIN, Jeff Brain is past president of the Sherman Oaks Chamber of 
Commerce and co-chair of the Sherman Oaks Town Council. He is a candidate for 
the 5th District council seat. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first week of December, Zev Yaroslavsky will prematurely vacate his Los 
Angeles City Council seat to assume his new role as a county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the council appoints an interim council member to fill this vacancy, 
which it is authorized but not obligated to do, the 5th District -- which 
includes Bel-Air, Century City, Fairfax, Sherman Oaks, Westwood and portions of 
Studio City, Van Nuys and North Hollywood -- will be without representation on 
the City Council for more than seven months, until a newly elected council 
member takes office in July, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who lives or works in this district, as I do, should be concerned about 
the impact of a seven-month vacancy in this seat and ask in Yaroslavsky's 
absence, Who's minding the store? 
</P>
<P>
 I am appealing to the members of the L.A. City Council to make it a priority 
to appoint an interim council member to the 5th District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 This seat represents a full-time job that requires the complete focus and 
attention of one very dedicated and experienced decision-maker, someone who is 
familiar with the special dynamics of the 5th District and who understands the 
inner workings of city government. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever they appoint should not be a candidate for the elected seat. It will 
be no easy task for the council members to find such a qualified person. I 
recognize the conflicting motivation of council members who oppose an interim 
appointment as they view the prospect of splitting the city pie 14 and not 15 
ways. I am asking them to make an appointment because it is essential to the 
welfare of the 5th District. It is morally the right thing to do; it's good 
government, and I urge the mayor if necessary to intercede. 
</P>
<P>
 We elect council representatives to be advocates for the interests of our 
district. The 5th District encompasses both San Fernando Valley and Westside 
areas with varied interests, and our councilman's premature departure may well 
jeopardize the well-being of these areas by leaving them unrepresented if the 
City Council does not act. The needs of this district cannot be placed on hold 
or ignored for seven months or even seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope those who live and work in the 5th District will add their voices to 
mine in this appeal. The Northridge earthquake was the worst natural disaster 
in American history. In its wake, how council vacancies were or were not filled 
in the past is irrelevant under the extraordinary circumstances confronting the 
city and the 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks, Studio City and Westside areas in the 5th District are 
struggling to rebuild. We must ensure that these areas get their fair share of 
the forthcoming financial assistance that will be divvied up by the City 
Council in the coming months. Relief funding has been fought for and allocated 
only after heated debates about which communities should get what and why. 
</P>
<P>
 These parts of the 5th District were some of the hardest hit areas of the city 
and can ill afford to be left out in the cold in earthquake recovery. However, 
that is exactly the danger these areas now face and will continue to face 
during the next seven months and beyond. What about the very basic principle of 
no taxation without representation?  
</P>
<P>
 People who live in the Fairfax district, Van Nuys and Westwood have a stake in 
the decision as well. Crime is a serious problem in Los Angeles, and reducing 
crime is an ongoing and demanding process requiring money and manpower. When 
the money is up for grabs during next year's budget process, 5th District areas 
need someone representing their interests to ensure that it receives its fair 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who lives and works in the 5th District, I feel it is my civic 
responsibility to do my part to preserve our voice in local government. I hope 
others will add their voices to persuade the L.A. City Council to do the right 
thing and make a swift and appropriate appointment.

NO. 1 FLORIDA GAINS EVEN MORE RESPECT; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TWO EASY GAMES TO 
START THE SEASON DON'T COMPARE WITH THE GATORS' 31-0 VICTORY AT NO. 15 
TENNESSEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-ranked Florida didn't score 70 points again, but the Gators' 31-0 victory 
over No. 15 Tennessee on Saturday night was even more impressive than their 
first two blowout victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Dean passed for 303 yards and two touchdowns as the Gators beat a ranked 
opponent on the road for the first time in eight tries under Coach Steve 
Spurrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing before 96,656, Florida took a 24-0 halftime lead and went on to hand 
Tennessee its first shutout in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida beat New Mexico State, 70-21, and Kentucky, 73-7, in its first two 
games, but both opponents were outclassed. The Gators were favored by only 4 
1/2 points at Tennessee, where they had lost their last two games by a combined 
score of 76-17. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first game on the new grass field at Neyland Stadium, which had 
been covered with artificial turf since 1968. However, the Gators (3-0 overall, 
2-0 Southeastern Conference) seemed more comfortable on the surface than the 
Vols (1-2, 1-1), who were shut out for the first time since a 44-0 loss to 
Georgia in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, who threw 11 touchdown passes in his first two games, added two more 
against Tennessee -- a 22-yarder to Jack Jackson in the second quarter and a 
16-yarder to Aubrey Hill in the third period. The senior quarterback completed 
18 of 26 passes with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean led the Gators to scores on four consecutive possessions in the first 
half. Two of the touchdowns came on runs by freshmen running backs, Fred 
Taylor's seven-yarder in the first quarter and Elijah Williams' one-yard plunge 
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Judd Davis added a 23-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee used three quarterbacks -- starter Todd Helton and freshmen backups 
Peyton Manning and Branndon Stewart -- but none could lead the Volunteers into 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida's aggressive defense had five sacks and 11 other tackles behind the 
line of scrimmage as the Gators recorded their first shutout since a 52-0 
victory over Vanderbilt last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Volunteers drove to the Florida five in the closing seconds, but the 
Gators sacked Stewart on the final play to preserve the shutout. Tennessee's 
John Becksvoort missed a 38-yard field goal earlier in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tennessee's worst defeat since a 38-6 loss to Auburn in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson returned the opening kickoff 60 yards and Florida drove to the 
Tennessee 14 before the drive was halted by Ben Talley's interception. After 
that, there was no stopping the Gators.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; PENN ST. HUMBLES ANOTHER FOE, 61-21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Penn State has been so thoroughly dominant that the Nittany Lions are starting 
to wonder what it is like for their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6-ranked Penn State, 3-0 overall and 2-0 in the Big Ten, jumped to a 45-0 
lead and cruised to a 61-21 victory over Iowa on Saturday at State College, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 The game followed the pattern of Penn State's first two victories -- 56-3 over 
Minnesota and 38-14 over USC. In each game, Penn State has led at least 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder what it's like to be on the other side of the field," tailback 
Ki-Jana Carter said. "I wonder what they are thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter scored two first-quarter touchdowns and backup tailback Mike Archie 
scored three times in the first 16 minutes as Penn State put away Iowa (2-1, 
0-1) early. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State took advantage of a blocked punt, an interception, a fumble and a 
porous Iowa defense to build a 42-0 lead, as Archie got his third score on a 
four-yard run 37 seconds into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State ran for 309 yards, passing only 13 times. Quarterback Kerry Collins 
completed five of seven passes for 98 yards and one touchdown in limited duty. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, Archie made the score 14-0 when he broke through the 
line of scrimmage, threw a fake that froze Iowa cornerback Damien Robinson and 
ran 35 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the second touchdown, Mike Archie almost broke those kids' ankles," Carter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the horrific start, Iowa was able to settle down and move the ball, 
outgaining Penn State 455 yards to 433. 
</P>
<P>
 "As bad as things went out there today, we can definitely see some positive 
things," fullback Kent Kahl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa didn't stop Penn State until Coach Joe Paterno pulled Collins with 11:05 
left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nittany Lions put the game away in the first quarter when they scored 21 
points in about two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 After Archie's second score made it 14-0, linebacker Phil Yeboah-Kodie 
recovered a blocked punt in the end zone for a 21-0 lead. Two plays later, Penn 
State cornerback Tony Pittman, who also had an interception, forced a fumble by 
wide receiver Demo Odems and Yeboah-Kodie fell on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern 14, Air Force 10 -- This nonconference game at Air Force Academy, 
Colo., was supposed to feature lots of offense, but it came down to a touchdown 
on a 96-yard return of a fumble recovery by Wildcat cornerback Chris Martin 
with 12:12 left to play and an interception by linebacker Geoff Shein that 
killed a scoring threat by the Falons with about a minute remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern Coach Gary Barnett said another key was the punting of Paul 
Burton, who had three punts of more than 60 yards and a 57-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is he a weapon or what?" Barnett said. "My biggest worry with Paul is that he 
will get used to kicking in this altitude (6,800 feet above sea level) and want 
to transfer." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first victory for Northwestern (1-1-1) in the last 11 games, 
including a 41-41 tie with Stanford the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force (0-3) held Wildcat running back Dennis Lundy to 60 yards in 18 
carries. He had 138 yards against Notre Dame and 130 against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good plan and the kids executed it," said Falcon Coach Fisher 
DeBerry. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State 27, Pittsburgh 3 -- The Buckeyes had five sacks, five other tackles 
for losses, caused a fumble, intercepted a pass, broke up four passes and 
blocked two kicks in manhandling the Panthers in a nonconference game at 
Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitt (1-2) was held to 139 yards passing and 103 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State quarterback Bob Hoying completed 14 of 21 passes for 217 yards and 
two touchdowns, a 12-yarder to Buster Tillman in the second quarter and a 
43-yard strike to Chris Sanders in the third. Hoying set up Tillman's touchdown 
with a 45-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie George rushed for 126 yards in 17 carries and also scored a touchdown 
for Ohio State (2-1), which had 512 yards but committed five turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitt was limited to 242 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois 34, Northern Illinois 10 -- Johnny Johnson, relegated to No. 2 
quarterback after a season-opening loss, passed for two touchdowns and the 
Illini (2-1) pulled away in the second half at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who completed 15 of 20 passes for 222 yards, relieved in the second 
quarter after starter Scott Weaver had thrown two interceptions. Johnson 
immediately directed the Illini on a 69-yard drive, aided by a third-down pass 
interference call. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Illinois (0-3) trailed only 14-10 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue 49, Ball State 21 -- Mike Alstott rushed for 156 yards and four 
touchdowns in 19 carries and Carey Rogers ran for 124 in 13 to lead the 
Boilermakers at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time since 1983 that Purdue had two 100-yard rushers in one 
game, and it gave the Boilermakers their first 2-0 start in a season since 
1978. Purdue beat Toledo, 51-17, in its opener. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boilermakers survived turnovers on their first three possessions, then 
dominated the Cardinals (0-2) with their most productive rushing performance 
since Mel Gray had 176 yards and Lloyd Hawthorne 109 against Indiana in 1983.

EAST ROUNDUP; NO. 18 VIRGINIA TECH DEFEATS BOSTON COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virginia Tech is off to its best start since 1981 because of its defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18th-ranked Hokies (3-0) defeated Boston College, 12-7, Saturday at Boston 
by limiting the Eagles to 244 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 BC was shut out until Jeff Ryan threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Pete 
Mitchell with six left. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Tech needed a strong defensive effect because the offense managed 
only 233 yards and no touchdowns. The Hokies' only touchdown came on Torrian 
Gray's 66-yard return on one of his team's four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very fortunate to be able to win while we look ragged," Virginia Tech 
Coach Frank Beamer said. "Offensively, we're awful close. We're closer than 
what it looks like." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College (0-2) is far from its level of last season, when Glenn Foley 
ran the offense. The Eagles beat Virginia Tech, 48-34, last year as the teams 
combined for 1,126 yards. They combined for 477 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Tech, which was 4-0 in 1981, held Boston College to just four first 
downs in the first three quarters before giving up seven in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hokies began the game as the nation's second stingiest defense, allowing 
160.5 yards per game, having held its other opponents below 200 yards and 10 
first downs.

ACC ROUNDUP; STANICEK LEADS NORTH CAROLINA IN 49-0 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a rare show of emotion from an unlikely source, but it was just the 
spark to light 16th-ranked North Carolina after a week away from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Stanicek became North Carolina's all-time passing leader on Saturday and 
also ran for two touchdowns in a 49-0 victory over Tulane at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
He said the team might not have produced that many points had it not been for 
some emotional pleas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach (Mack) Brown gave a very different approach before this game. He was 
more emotional, more intense than he usually is," Stanicek said. "It wasn't 
what he was saying. It was the way he was saying it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's usually very calm, but today he was very much more intense, louder, and 
just screaming and stuff like that. It really got us motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanicek completed seven of 15 passes for 161 yards and two touchdowns. His 
career passing yardage reached 3,852, surpassing the mark of 3,840 by Matt 
Kupec from 1976-79. Stanicek also ran for touchdowns of 11 and seven yards, the 
first time he has run for two touchdowns in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to him before the year started and he told me he wanted me to break 
his records," Stanicek said. "I feel great about doing it, but now I'm glad 
it's behind me and I can look forward to the rest of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina (2-0) also got a little more production from its tailbacks 
after they struggled in the opener against Texas Christian. Curtis Johnson ran 
for 65 yards and a touchdown, and Leon Johnson added 72 yards and a 
fourth-quarter score. Last year, the Johnsons each rushed for more than 1,000 
yards, but Stanicek led the running attack against TCU. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulane (1-2) had problems on both offense and defense. The Green Wave 
committed five turnovers, and the defense gave up several key third-down plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland 24, West Virginia 13 -- Allen Williams rushed for 163 yards -- almost 
100 more than Maryland had managed in its two previous games -- and Kevin Foley 
passed for 287 to lead the Terrapins at Morgantown, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland (1-2) entered the game averaging only 33.5 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia (1-3) lost for the first time in 11 home games. The 
Mountaineers, 11-1 last season, are averaging only 10.25 points per game after 
managing only two field goals and a touchdown against Maryland, which ranked 
105th in points given up. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia's first drive ended after tight end Lovett Purnell ran out of 
bounds a yard too soon on a third-and-15 reception. The Mountaineers' second 
drive ended when Jimmy Gary lost four yards on a third-and-1, and the third 
stalled at Maryland's 4 when Jim Freeman fumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia 9, Clemson 6 -- Freshman Ronde Barber's interception with 1:49 to 
play made up for a slew of Cavalier miscues and set up the winning score at 
Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber picked off a pass by Louis Solomon and returned it 35 yards to the 
Clemson five. Four plays later, Rafael Garcia kicked a 19-yard field goal with 
26 seconds left to give Virginia, 2-1 overall and 1-1 in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference, only its second victory over the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson (1-2) is 0-2 in the ACC for the second time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers still have a 31-2-1 edge in the series, but Virginia is 2-2-1 in 
the last five meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's game, the Cavaliers were penalized nine times and lost three of 
their four fumbles, including one at the Clemson goal line. Virginia's 
alternating quarterbacks had four passes intercepted, one at the goal line and 
another in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clemson had problems of its own. The Tigers, after being held to 21 yards 
rushing a week ago in a 29-12 loss to North Carolina State, once again stumbled 
on offense. They had only seven first downs and were held to 60 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia's third fumble, the second by fullback Charles Way, was recovered by 
Clemson linebacker Chris Franklin at the Cavalier 13 with 7:17 remaining. A 
three-yard rushing loss and two incomplete passes set the stage for a 33-yard 
field goal by Nelson Welch that tied it with 6:29 remaining.

SEC ROUNDUP; LONG SCORING PASS LIFTS ALABAMA OVER ARKANSAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jay Barker and Sherman Williams combined on a 73-yard touchdown pass play late 
in the third quarter and No. 12 Alabama stuffed Arkansas on six consecutive 
possessions Saturday in beating the Razorbacks, 13-6, at Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' touchdown made the score, 10-6, and Alabama was content to play 
safe, punt and wait on an Arkansas mistake. It came early in the fourth quarter 
when Matt Wait, who had a punt blocked in the third quarter, made a 12-yard 
punt into the wind. Alabama took over at the Arkansas 23, ran three plays and 
Michael Proctor kicked a 34-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a 6-3 lead on Lance Ellison's second field goal, Arkansas started 
from its 28, 10, eight, 20, four and 48 and made only one first down. Willie 
Gaston ended the last two possessions with interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas made 158 yards and nine first downs in the first half; 109 yards and 
three first downs in the second half, including one on a 66-yard run by Oscar 
Malone. That run led to Lance Ellison's second field goal, a 31-yarder that 
gave the Razorbacks a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama faced third and 10 at its 27 when Barker, out of the shotgun, 
sidestepped a defender and drifted toward the line of scrimmage. His pass 
cleared a receiver and a couple of defenders and was caught by Williams near 
the Alabama 45. He cut inside Mike Nunnerley and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also carried 33 times for 142 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia 70, Northeast Louisiana 6 -- Greg Bright and Carlos Yancy returned 
interceptions for touchdowns in the first quarter and Eric Zeier passed for 
three touchdowns at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Bright's 36-yard return broke a scoreless tie with 11:19 to play in the 
opening quarter and Yancy came back 2:10 later to score on an 81-yard return 
after the Indians had reached the Bulldog 30. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third loss in a row for the Indians, a former Division I-AA 
national power moving into I-A this season. Georgia is 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Georgia's most lopsided victory since 1958, when it defeated The 
Citadel, 76-0, and the worst loss for Northeast Louisiana since 1977, when it 
was defeated by Cincinnati, 63-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Bowie scored touchdowns on runs of five, one and two yards and freshman 
Hines Ward, a quarterback making his first start at tailback, ran for 117 yards 
in 15 carries, including a 35-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier, who completed eight of 10 passes for 164 yards, had scoring passes of 
71 and five yards to Brice Hunter and 24 yards to Hason Graham. On the 71-yard 
play, Hunter caught the ball on a crossing pattern on his own 40, crossed to 
the left sideline and outran the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Marisa Simpson scored Georgia's other touchdown on a three-yard run in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Northeast Louisiana avoided a shutout with an 80-yard drive in the fourth 
quarter that ended on Eric Foster's six-yard run with 14:09 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians gambled at the start of the game with an onside kick that kicker 
Roger Miller recovered on the Indian 47. Their first series included a fake 
punt.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP; COLORADO STATE UPSETS BYU, 28-21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LaVell Edwards will have to wait at least a week for his 200th victory as No. 
22-ranked Brigham Young was upset by Colorado State, 28-21, Saturday at Provo, 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he gets it -- next week," said Colorado State's Greg Myers. "We didn't 
want to allow that to happen against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers had two of the four interceptions off BYU's John Walsh, who was also 
sacked four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers turned his first interception into a first-quarter touchdown with a 
30-yard return. "I think it was a key moment," Meyers said. "We needed 
something to get us going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense was confident coming into this game. We knew we had the potential 
to beat BYU." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Anthoney Hill completed 17 of 31 passes for 280 yards and ran for 
a touchdown for the Rams, who are 3-0 for the first time since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh completed 27 of 57 passes for 358 yards for BYU (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards (199-74-3) is trying to become the 13th coach to win 200 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a major disappointment. I thought we were ready to play," Edwards 
said. "Credit Colorado State." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State Coach Sonny Lubick was the defensive coordinator for then 
top-ranked Miami when BYU upset the Hurricanes, 28-21, in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want anyone who saw this on television to say, 'That's one heck of a 
defensive unit,' " he said. "I have never been so proud of a team as I am of 
this bunch of guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State intercepted three passes in building a 21-10 halftime lead, 
then held off a BYU comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 After David Lauder's 33-yard field goal cut it to 21-13, Colorado State's 
Scott Lynch made the fourth interception off Walsh. Hill drove the Rams 63 
yards in seven plays, with Van Ward going the last yard to make it 28-13 with 
5:15 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 BYU had another drive stall at the Colorado State 19 in the third quarter when 
Walsh was sacked for a 10-yard loss on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh's six-yard touchdown pass to Mike Johnston with 1:14 to play and a 
two-point conversion pass to Mark Atuaia got the Cougars back to within a 
touchdown. But BYU failed to recover the onside kick and Colorado State ran out 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming 17, Tulsa 7 -- Ryan Christopherson gained 163 yards in 35 carries and 
scored a touchdown to lead the Cowboys to a nonconference victory at Laramie, 
Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
 The 236-pound Christopherson, the nation's leading rusher, punished the Tulsa 
defense all day, even after suffering a bruised right shoulder in the third 
play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how tough he is," Wyoming Coach Joe Tiller said. "Ryan got tattooed 
all afternoon. I thought he stepped up his play in the second half. He is so 
mentally tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming won despite losing 105 yards on 12 penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 BIG WEST 
</P>
<P>
 Micah Knorr kicked a 45-yard field goal and Pratt Lyons added a safety to give 
Utah State a 5-0 a nonconference victory over Ohio University at Athens, Ohio. 
The Aggies (1-2) allowed the Bobcats (0-2) to cross midfield only twice, and 
never inside the 35. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTHWEST 
</P>
<P>
 With the memory of wasted chances against UCLA, Southern Methodist (1-2) 
scored with three seconds remaining to defeat New Mexico, 34-31, in a 
nonconference game at Dallas. On the winning play, SMU quarterback Ramon 
Flanigan stepped away from two defenders and hit Brian Berry with a seven-yard 
touchdown pass. "The players willed themselves to win," Mustang Coach Tom 
Rossley said. "They knew we were going to win this game." New Mexico (0-3) fell 
to Southwest Conference team for the third time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 MIDWEST 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Seitz kicked a 37-yard field goal into a gusting wind as time ran out to 
give Miami of Ohio a 17-17 tie with Cincinnati at Oxford, Ohio. Jon Bacon, 
Cincinnati's kickoff specialist, hit a school-record 58-yarder with a 15 m.p.h. 
wind at his back to give the Bearcats (0-2-1) their only lead at 17-14 with 
1:19 to play. Miami (0-2-1) went 60 yards in 12 plays to set up Seitz's field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Waters threw two touchdown passes and Southern Mississippi stopped two 
second-half Memphis drives inside the 10 as the Golden Eagles beat the Tigers, 
20-3, at Hattiesburg, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, a much-maligned, fifth-year senior, completed 19 of 33 passes for 188 
yards, including a 12-yard touchdown to Ryan Pearson and a 13-yard score to 
Fred Brock. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Miss (2-1) and Memphis (1-2) are among five independent teams that 
make up the new Liberty Bowl Alliance, which will determine the host team for 
the Dec. 31 bowl game at Memphis, Tenn. Only Southern Miss has two wins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Eagles led 14-3 when Waters found Brock open in the left corner of 
the end zone with 2:45 left in the third quarter. It was Waters' fourth 
straight completion on the 10-play, 80-yard drive after Memphis missed a field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 L.T. Gulley returned an interception 23 yards for a touchdown on the first 
play of the fourth quarter to finish the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of eight second-half possessions for Memphis ended in Southern Miss 
territory, but produced no points. Two ended at the 7, one on a missed 24-yard 
field goal by Luis Tejeda and the other on an incomplete pass on 
fourth-and-goal by Tony Scarpino after the Tigers had moved 73 yards in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarpino completed just 15 of 37 passes for 149 yards, with three 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters hit Pearson in the end zone six minutes into the game to give Southern 
Miss, which outgained Memphis only 259 yards to 232, the lead for good.

RITE OF PASSAGE; THE PANAMA CANAL IS 51 MILES OF 'THE GREATEST LIBERTY MAN HAS 
EVER TAKEN WITH NATURE' -- AND A PRIZED JEWEL IN THE CRUISE-LOVER'S CROWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, Times Travel Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Atlantic begins here, the Pacific over there, and between them lie 51 
miles of deep ditch, aged machinery, steamy jungle, epic engineering, malarial 
history and murky politics. Every 45 minutes or so, another big boat floats 
past in the humidity, bearing oil or bananas or lumber or tourists through a 
110-foot-wide passage of concrete and steel. This is the jewel that so many 
cruise-lovers are so eager to wear in their crowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panama Canal, which opened 80 years ago last month, is also the 
public-works project that English writer James Bryce called "the greatest 
liberty man has ever taken with nature," a short-cut that saves about 8,000 
miles of South American circumnavigation on the journey between New York and 
San Francisco. That position makes it arguably the most valuable piece of real 
estate in the Western hemisphere, and it's no surprise that the world is 
watching to see how the U.S. and Panamanian governments handle their 
obligations to transfer ownership and operation of the canal on Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 What may strike some people as peculiar is the canal's parallel life as a 
tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, American tourists are seldom seduced by engineering prowess alone. 
(Who would seek out the Hoover Dam if it weren't convenient to Las Vegas? Who 
goes to Alaska to see the oil pipeline?) Cruise customers most often seek out 
creature comforts, coastal panoramas of uncompromised nature and prime shopping 
opportunities, none of which are found at the Panama Canal. Yet instead of 
viewing the canal as an obligatory stop for cruise lines, cruise passengers 
embrace passage as a badge of worldliness, a chance to spend eight or 10 hours 
steeping, quite literally, in history. 
</P>
<P>
 The hour may be early, and the air outside may be moist, but cruisers merrily 
crowd the decks when the heavy machinery and narrow locks come into view. Some 
of these cruisers neither know nor care how the engines in their automobiles 
work at home, but they'll gather in throngs to marvel at the idea that the 
gates of these locks are driven by the sputterings of a mere 40-horsepower 
motor. 
</P>
<P>
 My canal ship came in last May. It was a newly reconditioned 20-year-old 
vessel called the Star Odyssey, and it needed to be in Alaska for the summer 
glacier-watching season. To get it there and lure passengers on the way, the 
Star Odyssey's keeper at Royal Cruise Line arranged a 15-day cruise, beginning 
in Aruba, calling at Curacao, the canal, Puerto Caldera (Costa Rica), Acapulco, 
Puerto Vallarta, Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship was 674 feet long and 83 feet wide -- which would give the captain 
about 13 feet of leeway on either side as we slipped through the canal's locks 
-- with 404 passenger cabins and a capacity of 750. We had 10 decks, a casino, 
a swimming pool, a spa, a sauna, a weight room and aerobics area, a show 
lounge, a movie theater, five bar areas and a dining room large enough to 
accommodate all passengers in one sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The average age was between 65 and 70. ("Philadelphia" was among the films 
screened on the cruise, but many of the 600-plus passengers on my cruise, 
thinking of another movie from another time, kept referring to it as 
"Philadelphia Story.") 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the advanced average age was simple economics: A 15-day cruise 
requires hefty amounts of time and money. Another was that Royal cruises tend 
to attract older, more affluent travelers who have cruised with the line 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 But another crucial reason was the canal itself. Unlike most Caribbean or 
Mediterranean itineraries, it included many days without port calls -- eight, 
in all. A day at sea is a thing of beauty to a veteran cruiser, an unbroken 
expanse of time, rich in possibilities for subtle variation on pacifying 
routines. And then there was the central element in the canal itinerary, the 
busy ditch itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the greatest wonder in the world," said Roy Hamby, a veteran cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking with Hamby and others, I realized one key to the canal's popularity: 
For some of us schooled since World War II, the canal was a matter of about 12 
paragraphs in an 11th-grade textbook. Those educated before World War II -- 
that is, most of my fellow passengers -- learned about the canal as "the eighth 
wonder of the world." For those voyagers, a canal itinerary is a chance to lay 
eyes on something they've been curious about for five decades. 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, we laid eyes on Curacao, a Dutch island whose capital city, 
Willemstad, has built much of its economy around cruise ship tourism. We 
strolled past a few blocks of smartly painted Dutch architecture, an old 
synagogue, an outdoor market under brightly colored canopies and tourist shops 
where vendors attempted to peddle old license plates for $5 each. We resisted, 
returned for another evening aboard ship, and gathered the next day to hear the 
ship's lecturer, Frank Buckingham, run through some Panamanian-American 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 20 years after the adventurer Balboa discovered Panama's unique 
geographic position in 1513, the Spanish were already contemplating a canal. 
But it was the 19th-Century French builder of the Suez Canal, Ferdinand de 
Lesseps, who gained the necessary rights from Colombia (which then controlled 
the land that is now Panama) and started work in 1881. De Lesseps' Suez desert 
techniques failed miserably. He underestimated the difficulty of the digging, 
and didn't make the connection between mosquitoes and illness, which led to 
widespread malaria and yellow fever and contributed heavily to an estimated 
20,000 deaths among canal workers. De Lesseps resigned in disgrace, and for 
more than a decade the construction site sat largely idle. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the 1898 Spanish-American War highlighted the need for an 
Atlantic-Pacific Navy shortcut, however, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt 
resolved that a Panama canal would be a good card for him to hold. By 1903, 
Roosevelt had secured a treaty with newly-independent Panama, giving the U.S. 
jurisdiction over a 10-mile-wide canal zone. The work began again. 
</P>
<P>
 After a decade, another 5,609 deaths and more than 232 million cubic yards of 
digging, the canal opened to international traffic in August, 1914. Americans 
reveled in their accomplishment, but Americans were actually a small part of 
the work force: Author David McCullough has estimated that as many as 50,000 
construction workers labored on the canal, most of them descendants of the 
slaves who were brought from West Africa to the West Indies over several 
centuries. Surrounded by unstable earth and tropical humidity, many of them 
worked 10 hours daily, six days a week, for 10 cents an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty years later, remarkably little has changed in the canal's workings: 
Water rises and falls in three locks, and ships -- mostly container vessels and 
cruise liners -- putter across a man-made lake, paying weight-based tolls that 
last year added up to not quite $400 million. Almost all those ships bypass 
Panama's ports, which means that thousands of travelers have seen Panama but 
never set foot on its territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The canal is such a popular attraction that some of those ships have no need 
to use it, but do so anyway. Since 1985, Regency Cruises has been sending 
cruise ships on seven-day, Aruba-Jamaica-Costa Rica-Colombia itineraries that 
advertise a canal transit in the middle of the voyage. The Regent Star steers 
into the Caribbean end of the canal, passes through the first set of locks, 
makes a U-turn on sprawling, man-made Gatun Lake, and then leaves the way it 
came. This utterly purposeless seven-hour maneuver has made the seven-day route 
so attractive (most canal cruises are 14 days) that the Regent Star retraces 
that path weekly from October to April. 
</P>
<P>
 What does a canal cruise passenger do with all those days at sea? I compiled a 
catalogue. Play ping pong. Lie in sun. Sit in sun. Read romances. Scan the sea 
for dolphin fins. Drink in shade. Drink in sun. Moisten oneself with a mister. 
Play cards for fun. Play cards for money. Take dancing lessons. Listen to 
lectures on trans-Atlantic cruise history. Eat healthfully. Eat continuously. 
Sleep. Play bridge. Reminisce about previous cruises, other cruise lines, 
favorite routes. Talk about who's been dancing with the captain. Read David 
McCullough's definitive history of the canal, "The Path between the Seas: The 
Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914." 
</P>
<P>
 The calm approaches surreal dimensions. One day up in the fitness center on 
the top deck, with the Caribbean Sea sprawling outside in all directions beyond 
the picture windows, passenger Harrie Hess climbed into a fancy rowing machine 
in the middle of the otherwise idle room and settled into a rhythm. He was 
burning, the machine said, 502 calories per hour, but his labors seemed much 
greater and more mysterious: With each stroke, Hess's rowing machine emitted 
another fake water-splashing sound, splosh, splosh, splosh, and our 28,000-ton 
ship slid farther forward. 
</P>
<P>
 On canal day, the fourth day into the cruise, we woke early and scrambled to 
the rails in darkness. Around us lay a landscape simultaneously grimy, 
industrial, deeply green and intensely humid. Clouds were low and thick, the 
port buildings were boxy and utilitarian, and the water was still enough that 
birds could be heard twittering in the trees ashore. Directly ahead lay the 
110-foot-wide, 1,000-foot-long passage of Gatun Locks, with walls of concrete 
and slowly swinging gates of steel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't this exciting?" said a woman on deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it wonderful?" asked another. 
</P>
<P>
 While we watched guide lines being tossed and engines being revved, rising 
waters pushed our ship skyward. A Panamanian canal pilot had boarded to confer 
with the captain and take over the ship, as canal rules require, and with him 
came a lecturer who immediately took to the public-address system, beginning a 
daylong disquisition on the canal's history and operations. The sodium-vapor 
lighting that allows 24-hour operation of the locks. The 26 million gallons of 
water it takes to lift a cruise ship 27 feet in Gatun Locks. The stunt that 
daredevil journalist Richard Halliburton pulled in the 1920s, swimming through 
the canal and incurring a 36-cent toll. (Swimming is banned now.) 
</P>
<P>
 As the day progressed, we crossed broad Gatun Lake (one of three artificial 
lakes created in the canal zone by the harnessing of the Chagres River; it now 
includes an island wildlife reserve), rose to 87 feet above sea level, floated 
past the Continental Divide, then waited our turn to pass through the Pedro 
Miguel and Miraflores locks. Somewhere out of public view, cruise line 
officials paid the ship's canal toll -- about $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Our Panamanian pilot, Felipe Francis, quietly sipped orange juice and paced 
the bridge, calmly delivering orders and small talk in English and Spanish, 
depending on the language of the nearest subordinate. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in his early 30s and grew up near the canal. He had now spent seven 
years steering ships through it and expected to spend another 30 years doing 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the canal's future depends on the resolve of thousands of others 
like him. Especially since Panamanian riots over U.S. control of the canal in 
1964, the U.S. has been under pressure to yield its control of the canal. In 
1977, President Jimmy Carter agreed to December 31, 1999, as the date for 
Panama to take control, following a 20-year transitional period to be 
supervised by a binational Panama Canal Commission. Since then, canal officials 
have endured the 1989 U.S. invasion and imprisonment of Panamanian leader 
Manuel Noriega, watched the ominous deterioration of nearby non-canal equipment 
that is now overseen by the Panamanian government and seen the local economy 
shaken by the departure of dollar-bearing American troops and civilian workers. 
Then last May, Noriega's old party prevailed in the presidential elections. 
Canal Commission officials are quick to offer reassurances about the 
maintenance of the facility, the training of workers (Panamanians now make up 
about 88% of the canal work force) and the likelihood that tolls will remain 
stable. But the bottom line is that no one can be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, on May 12, 1994, the canal worked fine for us. George Baker of 
Rialto, Calif., one of the passengers who came because of the itinerary, told 
me he had cruised on the Black Sea, off the Baltics and on the Amazon. "The 
canal," he said, "impressed me about as much as any of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon we were back to familiar patterns: a day at sea, a day in port, another 
couple of days at sea, and so on, as the ship called along the coasts of Costa 
Rica, Mexico and California. 
</P>
<P>
 I went back to my catalogue of things people do on a canal cruise: Down in the 
pool, five women paddled through an exercise class. At a railing nearby, a man 
watched, smoked cigarettes and sipped beer. Inside, a crowd convened for bingo, 
and half a dozen gamblers slouched and leaned in the casino. In the Penthouse 
Lounge, afternoon tea was served. 
</P>
<P>
 From stem to stern, we idled, and daydreamed of jungles steaming and Theodore 
Roosevelt scheming. GUIDEBOOK: Cream of the Locks 
</P>
<P>
 Cruising the canal: Many cruise lines offer Panama Canal cruises. Royal Cruise 
Line's Star Odyssey, the ship I cruised on, next passes through the Panama 
Canal in November. That itinerary begins Nov. 21 in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., and 
includes port calls at Key West, Fla.; Playa del Carmen and Cozumel, Mexico; 
Grand Cayman; Ocho Rios, Jamaica; San Blas islands, Panama; the canal, and 
Puerto Caldera, Costa Rica. It concludes Dec. 5 in Acapulco. Fares for the 
14-day cruise are $3,015 to $8,127, depending on the level of accommodation, 
including air fare from Los Angeles. For more information: For details on canal 
cruises, contact a travel agent. Panama Canal: Ocean to Ocean Stepping up the 
Locks 
</P>
<P>
 The 50.7-mile canal contains a series of locks that cuts across Panama linking 
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Traffic on the canal keeps it open 24 hours a 
day, all year round. Here is how the locks operate. * 
</P>
<P>
 1. A ship sailing from the Atlantic Ocean enters the canal at Limon Bay where 
a harbor pilot boards the vessel and takes over the controls. The pilot then 
leads the ship to the Gatun Locks. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Once the ship enters the locks, large steel gates close behind the ship. 3. 
Water is then pumped into the lock, raising the water level. Once the water in 
the lock reaches the level of the next lock, the gates in front of the ship are 
opened and the "mules" pull the ship into the second lock. On descending locks, 
water is released. 
</P>
<P>
 4. This process is repeated until the ship reaches the Pacific Ocean. * 
</P>
<P>
 Gatun Locks The locks look like giant steps leading ships into Panama's 
emerald interior. A series of three locks lifts the ship 85 feet from sea level 
to Gatun Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mules" Ships are pulled up and guided through the locks with the help of 
small locomotive tractors, or "mules". The "mules," which are connected to the 
ships with cables, run on tracks on concrete islands along the canal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaillard Cut This manmade channel cuts through eight miles of hills, 
spanning the Continental Divide. The channel is roughly 500 feet wide and, at 
its shallowest, 39 feet deep. * 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting It Short The Panama Canal cuts travel distance between New York and 
Los Angeles by more than half.

TRAVEL INSIDER: ISLAND-HOPPING? WATCH OUT FOR HIGHER 'HEAD' TAXES; COSTS: THE 
SWIFTLY RISING CHARGES CRUISE LINES PAY FOR DOCKING ARE BEING PASSED ON TO 
CONSUMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a relatively small part of what you'll pay to take a cruise -- and if 
you're ponying up money for shore excursions, travel insurance and other added 
costs at the same time, you may not pay much attention to the column on your 
bill labeled "port fees" or "port charges and taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Better you should pay attention. Those fees, which cruise companies say are 
used principally to cover the cost of local "head" taxes on their passengers, 
have been rising rapidly in recent years. Though cruise companies don't usually 
include the fees in the "all-inclusive" cruise prices they advertise, they 
typically add 10% or more on a $1,000 seven-day cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago, on the average seven-day Caribbean cruise, the port charges 
were in the area of $30," says Larry Fishkin, president of the Cruise Line, a 
Miami-based agency that sells cruises to customers nationwide. "Now, I'd say 
the average is around $110. In five years, you're talking about a 350% increase 
in port charges." 
</P>
<P>
 An example: One of Holland America Line's seven-day western Caribbean 
itineraries (calling in Tampa and Key West, Fla., Cozumel, Mexico; Ocho Rios, 
Jamaica; and Grand Cayman) last spring carried $94 in port fees. Next spring, 
that figure rises to $115. 
</P>
<P>
 These fees shouldn't be a last-minute surprise. Cruise line representatives 
and travel agents are generally quick to disclose port charges to consumers 
before a sale is made, and the billing usually comes from the cruise line weeks 
before embarkation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise industry professionals say tax increases by foreign ports are the main 
reason for the increases and that the North American Free Trade Agreement -- 
which added $6.50 per passenger in taxes on cruises beginning in the United 
States -- also plays a role. But the industry's broad definition of "port 
charges" allows cruise companies to include various expenses, not just taxes, 
in that category. That explains why rival cruise lines often set different port 
charges for identical itineraries, and it leads some travel industry skeptics 
to wonder just how many variables influence port charge fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials say the most dramatic boosts in government taxes have come 
in Caribbean ports. In many cases, cash-strapped governments argue that 
thousands of cruise visitors are arriving and then leaving the island before 
they can be assessed the usual hotel "bed taxes" that traditionally help 
support the infrastructure that serves tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jamaica, officials pushed their passenger taxes (levies paid by the cruise 
lines, based on the number of passengers they're carrying) from $4 to $6 per 
head in 1990, then to $10 in 1992. After a confrontation with cruise lines -- 
who threatened to avoid the island if officials followed through on a proposed 
increase to $15 -- the rates rose last January to $13.50 in Ocho Rios and 
$12.50 in Montego Bay. Another round of increases is expected early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, says Fay Elliott, a marketing representative with the Jamaica 
Tourist Board, is vital to maintaining the area's infrastructure and port 
facilities under the stress of hundreds of thousands of cruise visitors 
annually. At Montego Bay, she notes, tax revenues are helping pay for a 
multimillion-dollar upgrade, including a new terminal and piers, now in 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cruise Line's Fishkin acknowledges the tax increases, but also sees 
another possible motive for cruise lines to keep the port-charge category 
loosely defined. 
</P>
<P>
 Say a cruise line wants to boost the price of a cruise that now costs $1,000 
with an additional $100 in various port charges. If the company added $20 to 
the port charges instead of the advertised cruise price, it could claim to have 
held prices flat. It also saves a little money in commissions, because 
commissions paid to travel agencies like Fishkin's usually exclude port 
charges. "If we were in a more regulated industry, like automobiles, this 
wouldn't go," Fishkin says. "But since we're offshore, they can get away with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise line officials offer much more benign explanations. In the case of 
Royal Caribbean, spokesman Jim Lida notes that the line's port charges include 
"all the associated costs of delivering a port of call," which include head 
taxes levied by local governments and other expenses. "For example, depending 
on the port, you may need a tugboat standing by." 
</P>
<P>
 One exception to the industry trend is Silversea Cruises, a Ft. 
Lauderdale-based luxury line that includes everything in one price -- not only 
air fare and port charges, but alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 For this simplicity, unfortunately, there is a hefty price to pay: For a 
seven-day Barbados to Ft. Lauderdale itinerary, prices begin at $3,495 per 
person, presuming double occupancy.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: NEW FEES FOR EXPEDITED PASSPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning Oct. 1, travelers in a hurry will have to pay a $30 fee for 
expedited processing of passport applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants who are scheduled to depart in 10 days -- and have the tickets or 
confirmed reservations to prove it -- are eligible for the special service, as 
are travelers who need their passports in order to apply for foreign visas. 
</P>
<P>
 Passports routinely require about two weeks to process -- longer during the 
February-July busy season. In Los Angeles, the passport agency is at the 
Federal Building, 11000 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 13100. The agency has a tape 
recording covering all aspects of passport applications. The number is (310) 
575-7070.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: COLOR IT AUTUMN IN THE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaf-lookers alert! Fall's coat of many colors is being delivered, and in a 
few cases, has arrived a little early. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, leaves start to change color first in northern climes and sweep 
steadily south. Factors such as exposure to sun, soil conditions, elevation and 
especially the weather determine when trees will reach their peak autumnal 
colors -- usually around mid-October in New England, a week or two later in 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 But in New York's Catskill Mountains, 15% to 20% of the trees have already 
begun to change color in the higher elevations, a tourism spokeswoman said, and 
in the Adirondacks, a 20% to 40% change is anticipated in coming days, largely 
because of colder nights. "The colors appear to be especially bright this 
year," the spokeswoman said. "All signs are pointing to an especially brilliant 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Splashes of color have been reported in Vermont, Virginia, New Hampshire and 
in Massachusetts, but Jim Sopher of the Massachusetts Department of 
Environmental Management says he doesn't see a major difference between this 
year and other years, although September has "been a little under average in 
terms of precipitation" and dry conditions are one of the factors that make 
leaves change color. 
</P>
<P>

 If you'd rather look at leaves closer to home, the Bishop Chamber of Commerce 
has published a "Fall Color Guide" for the Eastern High Sierra. The 
pocket-sized brochure describes colorful drives and lists accommodations, 
activities and events. Call the chamber at (619) 873-8405 to obtain a copy or 
to find out exactly when the leaves begin to change. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be wise to wait, a spokeswoman said. The extremely dry conditions 
could bring on early changes and, she added, "the high country had a little 
snow last week." There's nothing like a little rain and snow to knock every 
last leaf off the trees.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: BIG SUR; THE SCENERY IS PRICELESS, THE RIVERSIDE CABINS 
AFFORDABLE IN THIS RUGGED 'HABITAT OF THE RICH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY DUGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Dugan is a Times assistant Op-Ed editor.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The name evokes a last frontier, a place that remained wild into the 20th 
Century and lured iconoclasts such as Henry Miller and Jack Kerouac, who 
survived on abundant talent and not much money. Well, sort of. According to 
scornful old-timers, Kerouac arrived in a taxicab from Monterey and Miller made 
a very tidy living off his European royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, did live a self-reliant life on this rugged, glorious stretch 
of coast below Carmel, and their names endure in the geography -- Pfeiffer 
beaches and parks, Post ranch, Molera State Park. California 1 wasn't completed 
until 1937, electricity came in 1949 and dial phone service in 1956. Alas, "Big 
Sur today does not live up to its legendary reputation," writes Rosalind Sharpe 
Wall in her perceptive anecdotal history, "A Wild Coast and Lonely." "Artists, 
writers and latter-day hippies do exist and there are even marijuana growers 
there, but they are rare and not very flashy. It is mainly the habitat of the 
very rich, plus a dwindling handful of old-timers." 
</P>
<P>
 Those very rich who are without their own cliff-side vacation retreat can 
stay, for up to $500 a night, in the luxurious digs of the Ventana Inn and its 
newer luxe competitor, the Post Ranch Inn. The rest of you, go pitch a tent. 
Well, not quite. In Big Sur Canyon, nestled not right along the coast but next 
to the Big Sur River, are a few places for travelers who like the outdoors but 
not well enough to sleep in it. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband, Rob, and I headed north to our favorite, the Ripplewood Inn, a few 
weeks ago for a long four-day weekend. We're attracted to its individual, 
heated redwood cabins that hug the riverbank, most with kitchens and 
fireplaces. The biggest -- with separate living rooms or second bedrooms and 
decks -- go for a modest $80 a night. There are other similarly priced places 
nearby -- the cabins of Big Sur State Park and the motel units of the River Inn 
among them -- but we like the kitchens and the location of the Ripplewood.  
</P>
<P>
 One drawback is that Ripplewood kitchens come with a teakettle and nothing 
else. Zero. Not even a frying pan. But it's not that hard to pack a serviceable 
kitchen in a liquor box and a couple of bags. If you'd rather not cook at all, 
the Ripplewood has a home-style restaurant that does especially good 
breakfasts, and next door is the upscale Glen Oaks restaurant where chef 
Marilee Childs does inventive things with fresh, local ingredients, especially 
seafood and vegetarian dishes.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To feed the mind, the quirky little Big Sur Library (limited hours) is on the 
Ripplewood grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-mile drive to Big Sur is a reward itself, especially after departing 
U.S. 101 at San Luis Obispo, where you may want to stop at the last big 
supermarket for groceries.  
</P>
<P>
 We arrived at the Ripplewood near sunset on a Saturday and spent one night at 
a comfortable cabin above the highway because the bigger riverside cabins were 
all taken. (You need to reserve way ahead for these, especially in summer; 
units begin at $45 plus tax.) The next day we moved to Cabin No. 1, with its 
spacious living area, tiled kitchen, two queen beds and huge river-stone 
fireplace. The deck overhung the Big Sur River and only one window looked out 
on the tumbledown trailer on the next property. And the sense of space and 
isolation was priceless. 
</P>
<P>
 For dinner on arrival night we were joined by our photographer friend, Thea, 
and her companion, Ray, who were on the last day of their own mini-vacation. We 
made a risotto with shiitake mushrooms and some Aidell's hot-pepper sausage 
we'd bought from our Larchmont butcher. We steamed a double batch of mixed 
vegetables -- squash, carrots, asparagus -- and put aside half. Dessert was 
sharp Cheddar and tart apples. We washed it all down with a $10 Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next two days we hiked, exploring the canyons that contain the real 
history of Big Sur . . . up Partington Ridge, where Henry Miller lived, through 
deep and sacred redwood and tanbark oak forests, to the deserted and decaying 
Tin House, built all of sheet metal by Franklin Roosevelt's buddy, Lathrop 
Brown . . . around Andrew Molera State Park, at the mouth of the Big Sur River, 
with its easy two-mile bluff-top walk to a wild, windy and usually unpeopled 
beach. There we huddled in the lee of a cliff and ate our bagels, sausage and 
fruit while a flock of pelicans labored overhead against the gale. 
</P>
<P>
 We went through the tamed and paved but ecologically priceless Point Lobos, 
where patience is almost always rewarded with the spotting of a sea otter, the 
cutest of oceangoing mammals. In spring and early summer, the roaring sea lions 
out on Seal Rock can be heard for miles. 
</P>
<P>
 For our second dinner, we made an easy frittata with the leftover vegetables 
and sausage, supplemented with some sauteed peppers and onions. After dinner, 
we savored tea and a glass of brandy in front of the fireplace and fell 
dreamless into nine undisturbed hours of sleep, a grand luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers are not entirely bereft in Big Sur. The gift shops at Nepenthe (a 
legendary eatery with a great burger and better view), Big Sur Center and the 
River Inn have quirky arts and crafts, including some locally made soaps, 
jewelry and crafts. The Coast Gallery has lovely wood and stone crafts, and 
prints and paintings by Henry Miller, who was as much an artist as a writer. 
Carmel, 20 miles north, boasts dozens of galleries and a truly exhausting 
number of "shoppes." The Miller library, just south of Nepenthe, sells books, 
prints and local arts.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most-banned author in the English language, Henry Miller lived a quiet 
life in Big Sur, even by his own account (in "Big Sur and the Oranges of 
Hieronymus Bosch") and greatly admired the long-timers in the canyons around 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 For a taste of that older life, drive the unpaved 10-mile Coast Road, whose 
southern end is across from the entrance to Andrew Molera State Park, or drive 
Palo Colorado Road a few miles farther north. Both are narrow, bumpy and 
sometimes dark as they pass through the redwoods, but they are rewarding in 
both history and scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 For more temporal sustenance, the Ripplewood, the River Inn and Big Sur Center 
all sell basic foodstuffs; there's a terrific greengrocer, Pezzini Farms, and 
fish market in the shopping center at Highway 1 and Crossroads Boulevard in 
Carmel, about 20 miles north. So even the fussiest eater can fill in the gaps 
locally. 
</P>
<P>
 For our final evening, Rob and I combed our hair and walked a hundred yards to 
the Glen Oaks. Our fresh local squid with wild rice was terrific; the 
strawberries and ice cream crepe was a sin. The bill, even with wine (vintages 
by the glass), was a not-bad $60. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, headed homeward, we stopped to watch as a very low fog crept in 
and coated the surf far below the cliffs, then we headed onto an alternate 
route to U.S. 101, over Nacimiento-Fergusson Road at the southern end of Big 
Sur, just past the settlement of Lucia. (It was settled by the Dani family, one 
of whose handsome sons drove a Pfeiffer daughter to suicide by falling in love 
with her younger sister. Who said those settlers lived placid lives?) Budget

HIKING: NORTHERN CALIFORNIA: TOP VIEWS IN MARIN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Barnabe Peak, you get a fire lookout's view: Point Reyes, National 
Seashore, Mt. Tamalpais, as well as lots more of central Marin County. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel P. Taylor State Park preserves 2,700 acres of tan oak and madrono 
woodlands, creek-side redwoods and grassland. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From U.S. 101 in San Rafael, exit on Sir Francis 
Drake Boulevard and travel about 15 miles to the park. The park entrance is 
about two miles past the hamlet of Lagunitas. Park in the picnic area lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: From the picnic area, cross the bridge over Lagunitas Creek and turn 
left onto the bike/horse trail. The level path continues along the north bank 
of Lagunitas Creek, and is soon joined by a riding-hiking trail. A half-mile 
from this junction you'll come to another -- with signed Ridge Trail. Turn left 
and begin a steady ascent on Ridge Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit more than a mile from the summit, the fire road offers a parallel trail 
alternative; the trail is your best bet for spring wildflower viewing, whereas 
the road serves up better vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Join Barnabe Trail for a steep descent of a bit over a mile to meet the park's 
horse trail. Turn left, continue a short way, and turn right on the path to 
Madrone Group Campground. Ridge, Barnabe Trails Distance: 6-mile loop with 
1,300-foot elevation gain. Terrain: Steep grassy slopes, redwood-lined creeks. 
Highlights: Historic retreat, views on Barnabe Peak. Degree of Difficulty: 
Moderate with some steep sections. For More Information: Samuel P. Taylor State 
Park, P.O. Box 251, Lagunitas, Calif. 94938; tel. (415) 488-9897.

TASTE OF TRAVEL: CRUISES TRIM FAT FROM THEIR SAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDI DASH, Dash is an Ohio-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suggest a cruise vacation to a fitness buff, and you're apt to get a negative 
response. Sure, most lines have added aerobics classes and exercise equipment 
to their ships, and shore excursions now include active options such as 
white-water rafting, diving and mountain biking. But what about the food? A 
dozen feedings a day, a parade of killer desserts and that ominous midnight 
buffet . . . as one quipster put it: "Afloat you bloat." 
</P>
<P>
 Not in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to demand from health-conscious repeat passengers, and trying to 
attract younger vacationers, the cruise industry has lightened up its menus 
while beefing up athletic activities. Salad bars have become standard luncheon 
fare on the buffet deck. Vegetarian entrees and simply broiled chicken and fish 
dishes have joined the mix of red meats in the main dining room. More menus 
include appetizers, entrees and desserts low in calories, sodium and 
cholesterol. Even the midnight buffet has shaped up, with fresh fruits, light 
pasta dishes and other guilt-free items sharing space with beef stroganoff and 
crepes suzette. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last few years, I'd say nearly 100% of cruise ships have changed their 
meals and menus to accommodate passengers who want lighter, healthier fare," 
said Jim Godsman, president of Cruise Lines International Assn., an industry 
group representing 32 cruise lines. Jennifer de la Cruz, a spokeswoman for 
Carnival Cruises, said a recent study by her company's food and beverage 
department found a 300% increase in consumption of vegetarian entrees over the 
past few years, a 20% increase in seafood and poultry orders and a 20% decrease 
in orders of red meat.  
</P>
<P>
 Julie Benson of Princess Cruises said drinking habits have changed, too. "You 
used to see people at the bar and pool ordering bottles of liquor to take to 
their cabins. Now they're requesting bottles of Evian and a few limes," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to eat and drink to the hilt can still do so on most ships -- 
and many passengers still see huge amounts of rich goodies served throughout 
the day as an essential part of the cruise experience. But cruise lines report 
that more passengers are after quality rather than quantity and don't want to 
be confronted with food-laden tables every time they turn a corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually had people thank us for not having a midnight buffet," said Robin 
Lindsay, a vice president with 2-year-old Diamond Cruise, which operates the 
Radisson Diamond. The Diamond's dinner menu includes such healthful choices as 
vegetarian entrees, grilled fish and low-cal pasta.  
</P>
<P>
 Ann Burguieres of Regency Cruises said orders of diet-conscious items soared 
when her company created a separate "Lean and Light" dinner menu, which lists 
calorie, sodium and cholesterol information for each course. The line also has 
a special "Lean and Light" buffet at lunch, with salads, fresh fruits and 
high-fiber granola and breads. 
</P>
<P>
 The degree of food consciousness-raising on board varies from one cruise line 
to another, ranging from flagging a few low-fat items on the dinner menu to 
setting aside special dining rooms devoted exclusively to healthful eating.  
</P>
<P>
 The most ambitious program -- at a price -- debuted in May aboard Cunard's 
Queen Elizabeth II. Passengers on transatlantic crossings can book a $599 "Spa 
World Health and Fitness Package" that not only entitles them to the run of the 
ship's 6,000 square feet of exercise facilities, abundant spa treatments and 
lectures on nutrition and stress reduction, but also gets them a seat in a 
special dining room where only healthful low-calorie, low-sodium and low-fat 
food is served.  
</P>
<P>
 The package can only be purchased by passengers booking first-class 
"Columbia-grade" cabins, and once you commit to the Spa World dining room you 
can't switch back and forth between it and the regular restaurant. Traveling 
companions who want to dine with package participants in the Spa World 
restaurant but don't want spa food can order off the menu of the adjacent 
Columbia Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers who don't book the Spa World package can still eat healthfully by 
referring to specially marked menu items in the ship's other dining rooms. 
</P>

 "Not everyone wants to go the whole nine yards," said Cunard's Priscilla Hoye. 
"But a lot of our younger passengers really love the opportunity to focus on 
health and fitness afloat." * 
</P>
<P>
 Following are a selection of other cruise lines with options for healthful 
eating. (The lines also have extensive on-board fitness facilities.) Beware, 
however. Just because a ship caters to healthful eating doesn't mean you're off 
the hook willpower-wise. Norwegian Cruise Line, which offers lean dinner 
entrees, lunch-time salad bars and even fresh-fruit platters at its midnight 
spread, recently introduced a new buffet to tempt even the most intrepid dieter 
-- an afternoon Chocaholics' Bar.  
</P>
<P>
 * Carnival Cruise Lines. Spa cuisine is identified on menus, and extensive 
salad bars with low-cal dressings are offered at lunch on all ships. The line 
has added vegetarian entrees, and ship-board chefs have been experimenting with 
fresh herb and spice seasonings in lieu of heavy oil- and cream-based sauces.  
</P>
<P>
 * Crystal Cruises. Chef's selections at lunch and dinner recommend healthful 
full-course meals. In addition, guests can order an abundance of items on and 
off the menu at every meal, prepared as they like. The deck buffet at lunch has 
an extensive salad bar, and the fitness program's exercise physiologists can 
counsel passengers on how to eat healthfully on board. * Holland America Line. 
A full-service juice bar attached to the huge Ocean Spa on the Statendam, 
Maasdam and new Ryndam offers about 10 fresh fruit and vegetable juices, plus a 
variety of bottled waters. All menus flag heart-healthful selections.  
</P>
<P>
 * Princess Cruises. Light cuisine choices are offered at all meals, as well as 
extensive salad-bar selections at lunch. The midnight buffet is more of a snack 
than a spread. On-board fitness program instructors can give tips on healthful 
eating, as well.  
</P>
<P>
 * Royal Caribbean Cruise Line. The line's ShipShape health-and-exercise 
program includes specially noted ShipShape menu items for each dinner course. 
There's also a separate vegetarian lunch and dinner menu, which, though not 
made up entirely of low-cal items, always includes a sampling of healthful 
choices. The shipboard menus were created in consultation with an in-house 
dietitian formerly with California's Pritikin Longevity Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Royal Cruise Line. All cabins contain a 14-page booklet titled "Dine to Your 
Heart's Content," which gives tips on healthful eating on board, based on 
American Heart Assn. guidelines. The publication provides fat, salt and 
cholesterol information for selected foods and sample menu plans for daily 
dining afloat -- which are reinforced by flagged items on the restaurant menu. 
A lecture program called "New Beginnings" brings on board experts in nutrition, 
fitness, stress and other quality-of-life issues. They give scheduled talks as 
well as informal one-on-one consultations.  
</P>
<P>
 * Windstar Cruises. The line recently retained Joachim Splichal, 
chef/proprietor of two of Los Angeles' toniest restaurants: Patina and Pinot 
Bistro in Studio City, to create 180 new California-French menu items, designed 
to be gourmet-light. The menu relies heavily on fresh market produce from ports 
of call, and recipes often use spices in lieu of heavy sauces. No midnight 
buffet.  
</P>
<P>
 * World Explorer Cruises. The line offers a wide selection of vegetarian 
entrees and salad choices, and no MSG is used in food preparation. Low-cal and 
low-sodium foods are flagged on the menu. The midnight buffet is a light snack. 
On-board Passport to Fitness program instructors help passengers devise a plan 
for exercise and healthful eating afloat.

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: AVOIDING SERIOUS ILLNESS AFLOAT; DISEASE: THE SHIGELLOSIS 
OUTBREAK ABOARD THE VIKING SERENADE IS BEING CALLED 'RARE.' BUT THERE ARE WAYS 
TO CUT YOUR RISKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As more than 600 passengers and crew on the Los Angeles-based Viking Serenade 
discovered recently, walking up the gangway of a modern cruise ship doesn't 
insulate its occupants from serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
 A 78-year-old man died and five other Viking Serenade passengers were 
hospitalized last month after a shipboard outbreak of shigellosis, an 
intestinal disease that strikes about 15,000 Americans a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's 1,512-passenger Viking Serenade resumed its 
regular three- and four-day Mexico schedule after canceling two cruises when 
the shigellosis outbreak forced the ship to return a day early from its Aug. 29 
sailing. More than a third of the ship's passengers became sick, and at press 
time the source of the shigella flexneri bacteria was still under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the spread of Legionnaires' disease among passengers on Celebrity 
Cruises' Horizon caused one death. Sixteen Horizon passengers contracted the 
respiratory disease, and another 34 cases are suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 Illnesses of such proportions are extremely unusual among the estimated 4.5 
million travelers who take cruises from North American ports, according to the 
Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Horizon is 
the only cruise ship that has been associated with an episode of Legionnaires' 
disease, officials say. And the shigellosis on the Viking Serenade represents 
the largest of three gastrointestinal illness outbreaks the CDC has 
investigated on cruise ships this year, said CDC spokesman Tom O'Toole. The 
agency steps in whenever a cruise ship reports at least 3% of its passengers or 
crew with diarrhea or other symptoms of gastrointestinal illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "An outbreak (of gastrointestinal illness) on a cruise ship is a very rare 
event, period. And an outbreak of shigellosis is even rarer," said O'Toole, who 
notes that the number of shipboard outbreaks has declined steadily, from an 
average of 12 to 15 per year in the 1970s to between one and four per year in 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viking Serenade outbreak "is one of the largest we've ever seen," O'Toole 
said. "It's incredible to have an attack rate of 37%." Most gastrointestinal 
illnesses the CDC investigates involve less than 10% of a ship's passengers. 
"In a lot of cases, passengers become ill during shore excursions, not on the 
ship itself," he said. "But if you do have a problem on a cruise ship, it's 
magnified very quickly."  
</P>
<P>
 Comforting statistics aside, there are several steps passengers can take to 
minimize the chances of getting sick during a cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pick a ship with a good sanitation record. Cruise ships with foreign 
itineraries that call at U.S. ports are subject to two unannounced inspections 
by the CDC every year. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspections, which are paid for by the cruise lines, cover such areas as 
food and water handling, general cleanliness and employee hygiene. A passing 
grade is 86 of 100 points; ships that score lower than 86 are reinspected 
within two months. Experts caution that a failing score doesn't mean a 
gastrointestinal outbreak is imminent; nor does a high score guarantee safe 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viking Serenade scored a 92 on its most recent inspection in July, and 
hasn't received a failing score in at least five years, a Royal Caribbean 
spokesman said. But passengers would do well to avoid ships that show a pattern 
of low sanitation scores, experts suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 CDC test results are published twice a month in its "Summary of Sanitation 
Inspections of International Cruise Ships," known colloquially as the "green 
sheet." Many travel agents keep these on file. For a copy of the most recent 
inspection report on a specific ship, contact the Chief, Vessel Sanitation 
Program, National Center for Environmental Health, 1015 North America Way, Room 
107, Miami, Fla. 33132; or fax your request to (305) 536-4528. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watch what you eat and drink -- particularly on shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going on a cruise and not drink the water or eat the food. That's 
overkill," said Dr. Stephen Brunton, director of family medicine at Long Beach 
Memorial Medical Center, and a former cruise ship physician. But when 
passengers go ashore, particularly in underdeveloped countries, they should be 
leery of raw food, salads and uncooked vegetables, dairy products and 
undercooked meats and fish, experts say. Eating raw or undercooked foods on 
board also carries a risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the CDC asked cruise lines to post information on their ships, 
addressing the dangers of consuming raw or undercooked poultry, meat and 
shellfish. Many ships are now complying, said Donald Turner, chief of the CDC's 
Vessel Sanitation Program. * Before a trip, ask about the quality of medical 
care on board, particularly if you're in poor health. While a recent U.S. Coast 
Guard survey found that all major cruise lines sailing from American ports have 
emergency care facilities, no international or U.S. regulations cover medical 
personnel or facilities on cruise ships, said Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, there are "incredible variations" in the level of medical 
personnel training, quality of equipment and documentation of on-board 
illnesses and injuries, said Dr. Carter Hill, medical director of Holland 
America Line and Windstar Cruises, and chairman of the Cruise Ship and Maritime 
Medicine section for the American College of Emergency Physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The section has compiled a list of 10 recommendations for cruise ship medical 
care -- including a medical staff (licensed physicians and nurses) experienced 
in primary and emergency care, emergency medical equipment, supplies and 
medications and a staff fluent in English and familiar with U.S. or Canadian 
medical procedures, if the ship sails from North American ports.  
</P>
<P>
 If you have chronic conditions that might require medical attention while 
you're on board, ask your travel agent to check on the level of care available. 
Hill suggests such passengers bring along a copy of medical records and EKG, if 
applicable.  
</P>
<P>
 * Passengers should check that their medical insurance covers them outside the 
United States, and that they are covered for a medical evacuation.

TAKING THE KIDS: CRUISES FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When American Family Cruises -- a cruise line devoted to families -- failed 
this summer at a time when more children than ever are cruising, some industry 
experts said they weren't surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had an old ship and there's only so much you can do with an old ship," 
said Art Rodney, president of Disney Cruises. "And they didn't give the adults 
the experience they expected. Parents still want pampering and all the good 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Benson of Princess Cruises said that while her line's ships are full of 
kids at Christmas, Easter and during the summer, the numbers drop considerably 
the rest of the year. "The family business is very seasonal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too narrow a concept," agreed Larry Fishkin, president of Cruise Line 
Inc. of Miami, a major cruise discounter. "There wasn't enough for adults." 
</P>
<P>
 But does the closure mean there really isn't a need for cruises dedicated 
exclusively to families? Perhaps, since cruise companies that are offering 
kid-friendly experiences in tandem with adult amusements claim to be doing well 
in a growing market. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, more families than ever are cruising -- half a million a year, 
according to the industry trade group Cruise Lines International Assn., and 
their numbers are increasing annually. Carnival reports that it's carrying 
86,000 children a year while Premier, with its Looney Toons characters on board 
for entertainment, boasts that families account for 60% of its business 
annually. Despite the fact that Premier will in February lease the Majestic -- 
one of its three ships -- to a British company, amid reports that Premier is 
not performing well, company officials claim it is actually looking for a 
bigger ship to replace the 760-berth Majestic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family business is the fastest-growing segment in the cruise business. 
Every cruise line is promoting its family business," said Art Rodney of Disney, 
which is pouring $350 million into developing a cruise operation -- complete 
with two new 75,000-ton ships -- that is scheduled to launch in 1998 with 
family-size staterooms and combined Disney World and cruise vacations, 
according to Rodney. (Disney World is now offered in combination with Premier 
cruises.) The excursions will not be targeted just at families, though. Rodney 
said he expects the trips to appeal to seniors, honeymooners and other 
childless cruisers, as well as families with children. "That's the difference," 
Rodney said. "Parents want fun too." 
</P>
<P>
 While industry observers speculate that American Family Cruises went awry 
because it devoted all its resources to satisfying children without regard for 
anyone else, Bruce Nierenberg, founder of American Family Cruises, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take kids on a trip, the first eight things on everyone's list are 
whether the kids are having a good time," he said. Nierenberg lays blame on 
lack of support from the parent company, Costa, not on the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the American Family Cruises exit, the market appears competitive with 
plenty of programs and activities for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Premier -- On the Big Red Boat kids can meet and party with Bugs Bunny, 
Daffy Duck and Tweety, as well as participate in a range of children's 
activities and educational programs designed for children and their parents to 
enjoy together. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carnival -- Toddlers can paint their faces and finger paint while 5- to 
8-year-olds pig out at pizza parties and 9- to 13-year-olds publish a newspaper 
distributed throughout the ship. Teens can disco at parties just for them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Royal Caribbean -- Children design their own costumes to wear in a 
masquerade parade, show off their talents in a show or compete in table tennis 
and golf-putting tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Norwegian -- Kids learn circus routines and how to juggle and later perform 
for adults. They can visit the captain's bridge and even have scavenger hunts 
on NCL's private island. 
</P>
<P>
 * Princess -- While all ships offer children's programs, four have special 
youth centers with age-appropriate toys and games. The ships are Fair Princess, 
Star Princess, Golden Princess and Sky Princess. 
</P>
<P>
 By shoping carefully you can select the ship that meets your family's specific 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if there's a baby in the house, Princess would not be a good bet. 
Children under 2 aren't permitted on cruises. Norwegian Cruise Lines allow 
infants to cruise free and guarantees that baby-sitting will be available (at 
$8 an hour). Premier, which touts its family programs, does not offer 
baby-sitting for infants (the service is reserved for children 2 or older). 
Royal Caribbean has baby-sitting for infants, but suggests that parents bring 
their own portable cribs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ships offer programs for children only during peak periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears the first and third week of every month.

CRUISE: REUNIONS; ALL ABOARD; THREE GENERATIONS CREATE FAMILY MEMORIES ON A 
CARIBBEAN CRUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

section.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Short of achieving world peace and finding 12 jurors who've never heard of 
O.J. Simpson, there are few things tougher than getting all your loved ones in 
the same place at the same time. If the in-laws can make it, the grandchildren 
have T-ball, or somebody's working or not up to the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 For three generations of my husband's family, the solution this summer was 
combining a family gathering with a Caribbean cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a special gathering, not only a get-together but a reprise of one of 
our favorite memories. Two years before, my husband's father and stepmother had 
celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary by taking everyone on a Mexican 
cruise, figuring that for the price of a big party, they could have a week's 
worth of family fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost from the moment we got home that year, we were looking for excuses to 
do the whole thing again. Finally, last summer, the grandparents announced they 
were ready for a sequel. This time, the only theme was their desire to bring 
everyone together again -- kids, grand-kids, step-kids, in-laws, the whole kit 
and caboodle.  
</P>
<P>
 Little did we know we were sailing on the cutting edge: Reunion and other 
extended-family cruises, travel agents say, are one of the fastest growing 
segments of the industry, encompassing everything from modest group vacations 
such as ours, to a recent, nationally publicized $250,000 confab in which 300 
members of a Miami-based family took a weekend hop to Nassau and back. 
</P>
<P>
 The main advantage of a cruise, we discovered, is that you can really 
concentrate on quality time. Because cruises are all-inclusive, no one needs to 
worry about where you'll be eating, who'll clean up, whether you should all go 
out afterward, or if the kids will be bored. Accommodations, food, 
entertainment, youth activities, baby-sitting, even special cocktail parties 
are all either automatically included, or a quick phone call away. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest downside for most families is sticker shock: Fares for our 
13-member group amounted to about $1,800 per person, or about $7,200 for a 
family of four. But the price covered the flight to and from Los Angeles, 
overnight accommodations in Miami, seven days of first-class meals and lodging, 
and transportation to explorations in the Yucatan Peninsula, Jamaica and Grand 
Cayman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our group was made up of four households: my husband's parents, Gordon and 
Esther Magnuson; his brother and sister-in-law, Michael Magnuson and Heather 
Conwell, and their two teen-agers, Molly and Matt; his stepsister Kathy Dunham 
and her two teen-agers, Brian and Marnie; and our family -- my husband, Bob 
Magnuson, me and our daughters, 11-year-old Alex and 2 1/2-year-old Gina. We're 
an easygoing group, but when it comes to leisure activities, we can be a tricky 
crowd. Some are morning people, some are night owls. Some like to splurge, 
others are frugal. Some have time and energy and independence to burn, some 
have lap babies and bad backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the challenge, however, the trip ended up offering something for 
everyone. Alone, there were some among us who would have never given a second 
thought to a cruise, but as a consensus choice, it was just right. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip began with what turned out to be its only uncomfortable leg -- the 
long cross-country flight. By the time we arrived in Miami, where our ship was 
docked, we were almost too fatigued to have fun. In fact, the grandparents did 
opt for a quiet evening in our hotel. But it was one of those hot, velvety 
Miami nights that can be tough to resist. There was the smell of saltwater and 
disinfectant on the sidewalk, of tropical flowers and incense burning 
somewhere, and so the rest of us rallied in time for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 The teens and preteens, who were given permission to venture forth as a group, 
gave top marks to the Bayside Marketplace, a waterfront mall that featured an 
especially hard-rocking Hard Rock Cafe. Meanwhile, the adults and baby Gina 
dined in Little Havana, enjoying fried bananas, black beans, and pork chops 
with lime and onions. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday afternoon, transported and refreshed, we boarded our ship, Royal 
Caribbean's Majesty of the Seas, and then split up happily into our respective 
staterooms: One for the grandparents, three more for the parents in each 
household, a fourth for the three adolescent granddaughters and a fifth for the 
two grandsons (the baby bunked in a triple berth with us.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was an arrangement that particularly pleased the kids, who spent a lot of 
time staying up late, ordering room service and sleeping until noon or so in 
their fold-down bunk beds. It was also a break for parents: Thanks to the 
ship's extensive youth programs, the kids pretty much disappeared into their 
own world, a social circuit that began with a series of cruise-sponsored mixers 
for teens and pre-teens and lasted past midnight as international cliques of 
adolescents congregated awkwardly on the main decks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the adults fell into their own routines -- lounging at the ship's 
pools and hot tubs, listening to jazz and reggae in the lounges, gambling in 
the casino, playing bingo or just resting in the staterooms in front of one of 
several movie channels. (Our ship's selection included "The Pelican Brief" and 
"Four Weddings and a Funeral.") 
</P>
<P>
 Even the baby had fun, watching for dolphins from our porthole, splashing in 
the baby pool and visiting the big kids in their rooms down the hall. Unlike 
some lines, however, Royal Caribbean had little to offer her in the way of 
organized activities -- their children's program starts at age 5. They did 
offer baby-sitting for $3 a child until 1 a.m., but my husband and I were 
usually too sleepy to take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most evenings, we'd gather for pre-dinner cocktails in the grandparents' 
stateroom. Several of us had brought our own liquor and munchies to save on the 
bar bills, but we did splurge on a couple of evenings by meeting on the top 
deck in a circular lounge that offered spectacular views.  
</P>
<P>
 Then it was down to dinner which -- as is so often the case on cruises -- was 
routinely excellent. We filled two previously reserved, adjacent tables, one 
for the grown-ups, another for the kids, and stuffed ourselves nightly on cold 
soups and filet mignon, crab-meat cannelloni, duck with blueberry sauce and 
other gourmet entrees. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gina, there was a children's menu featuring pizza and chicken nuggets, and 
plenty of diversion. One night, the waiters and busboys serenaded us with an 
off-key rendition of "O Sole Mio"; another evening, they marched in a conga 
line balancing our dessert, a kind of sponge cake the chef had dubbed "Flaming 
Babalu," on their heads. In their free moments, our waiter, a young Turkish man 
named Kadir, and his assistant, a Thai busboy named Mickey, wowed the kids' 
table with jokes and napkin-folding tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 This, we discovered, is one of the nicer things about cruising -- the high 
level of personal interaction with the staff. Our ship carried some 2,500 
people in a vessel the size of a 14-story hotel, and yet we came to know 
everyone from the people who made our beds in the morning to those who poured 
our wine at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Also nice was the range of activity. There were, in addition to the amenities 
already mentioned, a health club, all-day exercise classes, a Western dance 
seminar, teen discos that our kids found passably cool, several lounges, a 
duty-free shopping mezzanine, battalions of studio photographers, casinos, an 
extensive library, wine tastings, skeet shooting, karaoke and entertainment 
every night.  
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest diversion came on Day Two, when current events overtook us, 
and our ship took on three boatloads of Cuban refugees -- one in the morning, 
one at midday and a third in the late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 At each announcement, throngs of passengers crowded the decks, snapping 
pictures and juggling video cameras, particularly when the second raft, 
carrying 30 people, showed up in the middle of lunch. Far below us, on the 
dark-blue water, the castaways gazed up from their little platform of bobbing 
tires and rotten boards. Someone threw them a rope, and they were brought on 
board and hustled off to a lower deck. Later that night, a U.S. Coast Guard 
cutter arrived to pick them up, 51 refugees in all. 
</P>
<P>
 The next three days were taken up with port excursions, for which we had to 
sign up in advance. Most cruise lines offer a variety of day trips, but they 
charge extra for them. We managed to save hundreds of dollars -- and have just 
as much fun -- by organizing most of our excursions ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The main exceptions were the grandparents, who sensibly opted, for example, 
for a $33-a-person tour of steaming-hot Cozumel in an air-conditioned bus, and 
my husband's brother and sister-in-law, who paid $60 apiece for an instructive 
tour of the Mayan ruins in the Mexican jungle city of Tulum. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking our gaggle of kids on such a tour, however, seemed too arduous, so we 
struck out on our own. On Cozumel, Bob, his stepsister Kathy and I rented 
mopeds for ourselves and the kids and toured the tropical island, stopping at 
one beach to snorkel, at another for drinks under a straw palapa , and at a 
third for a quick lunch of tacos and Cokes (sold at the not-all-that-reasonable 
tourist price of $2 a bottle). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Georgetown, Grand Cayman (the palm-studded scene of some memorable scamming 
in John Grisham's best-selling "The Firm"), we snorkeled and shopped. Smugly, 
we noticed that the blue waters we ended up exploring for free were the same 
ones that later served as the site of the ship's $26-per-person snorkeling 
tour. We also gave ourselves a pat on the back for bringing along our own fins 
and masks, since rentals tended to add up. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ocho Rios, Jamaica, we all likewise avoided the ship's excursions, and 
hired a guide at the dock who charged us $15 each for an all-day tour that the 
ship had priced at $23 per person for just four hours. In the capable care of 
our driver Audley Nugent and "Milo," his minibus, we made the rigorous 600-foot 
climb up the cascading Dunn's River Falls, hit gift shops and roadside artisan 
stands, hiked around a rain-forest, sampled bags of sweet, fresh pineapple from 
an outdoor market and dined on jerk chicken and curried goat at the al fresco 
Double V Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was back to sea for a day and a half, where the kids by now had 
developed a gang of new pals (and a fascination for a teen-aged British model 
who happened to be a shipmate and whom our nephews had privately dubbed 
"Euro-babe"). Our final excursion was spent lolling on a Royal Caribbean-owned 
beach on an island called CocoCay, which the cruise line had outfitted with 
bars, cabanas, barbecues and beach chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 On one of our last nights, my husband went up to the deck with his brother and 
father; by starlight, they talked quietly over Jamaican cigars. My 
father-in-law is by trade a civil engineer, but on that soft evening, 
surrounded by family, he was a poet who recited Carl Sandburg to his grown 
sons. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband later said, with characteristic restraint, how good it felt to see 
his dad so relaxed. But you never know what kind of discoveries -- and 
rediscoveries -- await when you set sail with the people you love.

GETTING THE MOST OUT OF A FAMILY GET-TOGETHER ON THE HIGH SEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For most extended families, planning any reunion takes -- well, planning. That 
goes double when the preparation is for a big family cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, from travel agents, cruise lines and our own family cruise planner -- my 
mother-in-law, Esther Magnuson -- are some tips to make sure your family 
adventure goes smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Start early. We held our first family meeting on this cruise a year ago. As 
a former travel agent, my mother-in-law, Esther Gordon, realized the importance 
of getting dibs on choice cabins and discount fares. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Kaplan, president of CruiseMasters, a West Los Angeles-based travel 
agency that specializes in cruises, recommends starting at least 12 to 14 
months in advance, with even more lead time for groups of more than 30. Most 
cruise lines offer hefty financial incentives to passengers who book early and 
in groups, with the 16th passenger typically receiving a free fare. Some lines 
even throw in such extras as free family photos, a cake and champagne for the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't try to do it all yourself. If pressed, most cruise lines will accept 
bookings directly from large groups, but you won't save anything by doing so. A 
knowledgeable travel agent, meanwhile, can not only steer you away from cruise 
lines and destinations that don't fit your family's style, but can help you 
find the best bargains, arrange special parties, help you decide what to pack 
and even surprise you with a complimentary basket of fruit or bottle of 
champagne in your cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once you get a head count and choose a cruise and a date, think carefully 
about room arrangements. Traveling with families usually means traveling with 
children, and that means securing at least a few cabins with three and four 
berths, which are often in limited supply. By booking six months in advance, we 
were able to secure six cabins near each other on the same side of the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't forget about meals. Cruise ships generally have two seatings for 
meals, and the later seating tends to fill up fastest. Families with young 
children typically choose the early seating: dinner at 6 or 6:30 p.m., versus 8 
or 8:30 p.m. for the late seating. Early reservations also help ensure you'll 
be able to land a table for eight, or several tables next to each other.  
</P>
<P>
 Let your travel agent or the staff of your ship know if your group is 
celebrating something in particular. Cruise lines can help you plan a festive 
dinner, bring out a surprise birthday cake, hang a banner on a special 
stateroom, set up a pre-dinner cocktail party or even print special 
commemorative napkins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask your travel agent about air fares and hotel accommodations that may go 
along with your group's package. Some lines will factor air fare, a night's 
hotel stay and transfers from airport to ship into your cruise fare; this may 
or may not be a bargain, depending on the amount of energy you want to put into 
booking your own flight or accommodations, and the number of areas from which 
your relatives have to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of our group, fortunately, all were coming from Southern 
California. Also, we felt there were too many of us to hassle with the air fare 
and hotel ourselves, and our cruise line, Royal Caribbean, was offering what 
seemed to be a pretty good deal -- a $399 fare on Delta from LAX to Miami with 
only one stop, plus a free night's stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami -- and 
they would handle the luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 This, as it turned out, made our trip much less complicated. One caveat: If 
you do let the cruise line handle your luggage, be sure to bring a change of 
clothes and essential toiletries in a carry-on bag. After we left the airport, 
we didn't see our suitcases again until we checked into our cabins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure your cruise line has something for every generation in your 
family. Some cater almost exclusively to adults; others have so many children's 
programs that couples feel like they've landed in a nautical version of 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for ships that offer fine dining, dancing and entertainment for adults; a 
broad range of port excursions; and programs for teen-agers, adolescents and 
younger children, agents say. But pay special attention to your line's 
restrictions if your kids are especially young -- some lines refuse to board 
children under the age of 2, and others have next to nothing to entertain 
toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Think about getting cruise insurance. The larger your group, the greater the 
chances are that someone may have to drop out at the last minute, or get sick 
and have to be flown home. For a nominal fee, insurance guarantees you'll get 
your money back in case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Designate a point person. Even with three out of the four households in our 
group living in the same area, there were a host of last-minute changes and 
snafus and scores of details to nail down.

CRUISE: TIPS; TOP TEN; WAYS TO LAND THE BEST DEAL: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James T. Yenckel and Laura Bly 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 1. Do your homework. Since most cruise lines refuse direct bookings, you'll be 
working through a travel agent. But no matter how savvy the agent, it pays to 
research options ahead of time -- from itineraries to style and size of ship. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Use a cruise expert. A knowledgeable travel agent can match you with the 
ship that meets your interests, and top-selling agents are often rewarded with 
big discounts to pass along to customers. You can use a travel agency that 
handles only cruises, or a full-service travel agency with expertise in 
cruises. Get references from frequent cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Comparison shop. Get price quotes from several travel agencies, at least 
until you find one you trust who will get you the kind of deal you want. Check 
newspaper and magazine travel ads for the latest cruise sales. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Don't equate cheapest with best. Book a cruise based solely on the fact 
that the fare is low, and you'll gain nothing if the trip disappoints you. A 
cheap fare may buy a small, windowless cabin deep in the ship's bowels. If 
tight spaces bother you, the cruise could prove very uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Book early. In the past two years, many major cruise lines have tried to 
reduce pricing confusion by structuring their rates so some of the deepest 
discounts go to passengers booking earliest. Early birds also get first choice 
of cabins and sailing dates.  
</P>
<P>
 6. Book late. On the other hand, the push for early bookings hasn't eliminated 
last-minute discounts, which are typically offered 60 days before sailing (up 
to 120 days out for exotic trips). You'll need to be flexible about dates, 
ships and itineraries. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Sail when others don't. Want to cruise at Christmas or other holiday 
periods? Expect to pay a premium. The same ship, leaving a week or two before 
or after Christmas, may be priced much lower. In the Caribbean, fall tends to 
be the off season. Early spring is the off season for cruises in Alaska and 
Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 8. Look for last-minute itinerary changes. When the Persian Gulf War forced 
cruise lines to redeploy ships from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean and 
Alaska, discounts of up to 50% were legion. And when Windstar Cruises pulled 
its 148-passenger Wind Spirit from Singapore to Barbados; the line offered "two 
for one" specials.  
</P>
<P>
 9. Read the fine print. Many of the best discounts, including "two for one" 
deals, don't include air fare and/or are limited to certain cabin categories. 
Check whether a low-cost air fare is included in the package price, unless you 
have frequent-flier miles to cash in or live close to the port of departure. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Consider cancellation insurance. If you cancel your trip at the last 
minute, penalty fees range from 10% to 100% of the fare, depending on the 
length of the trip and the ship involved. Typical insurance cost is $69 per 
person for a seven-day cruise, but be sure to ask what's covered and what 
isn't. Some plans allow you to cancel for any reason; others require a medical 
excuse. James T. Yenckel and Laura Bly

CRUISE: TIPS; TOP TEN; QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE YOUR FIRST CRUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shirley Slater 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 1. How long can you be away? Cruises can be three-day weekend sailings, 
seven-day cruises, 14 days or even longer. First-timers usually opt for three 
to seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Where do you want to go? Weekend and mid-week mini-cruises from Los Angeles 
usually visit Ensenada, with calls at Catalina Island and/or San Diego. 
Seven-day cruises from L.A. sail the Mexican Riviera, and fly/sail packages let 
you go farther afield to Hawaii, the Caribbean, Europe, Alaska or Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Are you traveling as a single, one of a pair or with children? Some ships 
offer "guaranteed share" rates for singles, and several cruise lines emphasize 
their full activity programs for children. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Do you want a large, medium-sized or small ship? Big ships (generally those 
more than 30,000 gross registered tons) have more entertainment, bigger casinos 
and spas and longer lines for everything from the captain's cocktail party to 
shore excursions; medium-sized ships have scaled-down versions of the same. 
Small ships (those carrying 200 or fewer passengers) are more apt to be free of 
regimentation and rigid dress codes, but you're often on your own for 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Do you want an older or a newer ship? Purists may prefer older vessels that 
look like ocean liners, since many new ships look more like hotels with their 
soaring glass atriums and glass elevators. Newer ships have identical modular 
cabins while older ships have individually constructed cabins that come in all 
shapes and sizes. Plumbing and air conditioning problems occur most often on 
ships more than 20 years old or on brand-new vessels during shakedown cruises. 
Some older ships with deeper drafts may ride more smoothly in the water than 
shallow-draft newer ships. 
</P>
<P>
 6. What do you want in the way of shipboard life-style? Decide what you think 
are the most important elements of a good vacation, jot them down and have them 
handy when you make your initial call to a travel agent. Small to mid-sized 
vessels usually provide a more relaxed ambiance, while glittering mega-liners 
throb with music and bright lights most of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 7. How much do you want to learn about the places you'll visit? While most 
ships provide port and shore-excursion lectures, the emphasis is often on 
shopping. Expedition-style vessels will give you the most in-depth information 
about history and flora and fauna, with slide lectures, reference libraries and 
specialized excursions ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Do you want frequent opportunities to wear your nicest party clothes, or 
would you prefer to stay casual day and night? Super-deluxe small ships are 
quite dressy, expedition and sailing ships casual. Big ships usually have two 
dress-up evenings a week where men are expected to wear a tuxedo, a suit, or 
jacket and tie, and women to dress in cocktail attire. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Do you want to go island-hopping on a ship that stops at a lot of ports or 
spend your time relaxing aboard ship? If relaxing is more important, look for 
one or two days at sea on a week-long itinerary. You'll still have ports to 
visit but you will get some rest in between. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Do you need to worry about getting seasick? Generally, fewer than 5% of 
passengers complain about seasickness. Modern ships are equipped with 
stabilizers that smooth out the rolling motion and shipboard doctors ready with 
prescription or over-the-counter remedies. If motion sickness is a problem, 
avoid transatlantic and transpacific sailings, as well as mid-winter sailings 
between Ensenada and Los Angeles. Smoother seas can be found in Alaska's Inside 
Passage, along the great rivers of the world and around the islands of Hawaii 
or the Caribbean. Shirley Slater

CRUISE: TIPS; TOP TEN; THINGS YOU'LL PAY EXTRA FOR AN AN ALL-INCLUSIVE CRUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kay Showker 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 1. Tips. On most ships, gratuities to dining room waiters and cabin stewards 
are all but mandatory. Tips to other service staff , such as the wine steward, 
pool attendant and maitre d', are strictly voluntary.Count on a total of about 
$10 per person, per day. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Port charges. These head taxes, which vary depending on the length of the 
cruise and its ports of call -- are levied by local port authorities. (For more 
on port charges, see Travel Insider, L2.) 
</P>
<P>
 3. Beverages. It's not unusual to pay $3 or more for a beer or glass of wine 
or $4 for a mixed drink, plus a 15% service charge added directly to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Beauty and spa services. You'll pay $40 or more for a facial or massage; 
$75 and up for more elaborate services. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Laundry and dry cleaning. Need that tux pressed before the captain's party? 
Expect prices comparable to those at full-service hotels and resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Shore excursions. Most passengers on a seven-day cruise take about two 
shore excursions, which are sold on board and range from as little as $18 for a 
two-hour city tour to $150 for a helicopter trip. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Souvenir photographs. Can't live without that Mae West shot of you in your 
life jacket during the safety drill? Expect to pay $5-$8 for a photo by the 
ship's photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Ship's doctor. On many ships, pills to alleviate seasickness are free. But 
doctor's visits start at about $20. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Telephone. Phoning the kids back home? You'll pay $15.50 per minute for 
satellite service. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Casino. What you spend is up to you -- and your conscience. Kay Showker

CRUISE VIEWS: RADISSON'S DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines. Cruise Views appears the first and third week of every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the two years it's been in service, we've been known to take unkind swipes 
at the outside appearance of the Radisson Diamond, a short, wide twin-hulled 
cruise ship that bears a striking resemblance to the "Star Wars" robot R2D2. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a recent transatlantic crossing -- 11 days from San Juan, Puerto 
Rico, to Lisbon, Portugal, with no ports of call -- we have nothing but 
admiration for the ship from the inside vantage point. The food, the service, 
the cabins and the entertainment were all excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 We chose to sail on a transatlantic cruise because we wanted to see how the 
vessel, purportedly impervious to the sort of motion that causes seasickness, 
handled in the sometimes-rough Atlantic. At first, the sea was smooth, but as 
we got closer to Portugal it turned choppy. While there was none of the usual 
roll or pitch, the ship would start into a rolling motion, only to have the 
four non-retractable stabilizers in the pontoons correct it after one degree. 
</P>
<P>
 The passengers on board for the crossing -- only 138 out of a capacity of 350 
-- had booked it especially for the long, relaxing days at sea, but 11 days 
with no ports of call might not thrill a first-time or infrequent cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, the Diamond should be a dandy ship for a Panama Canal transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Panama Canal sailings have turned out to be so popular that the line has added 
six more to the two previously scheduled this winter, making eight 10-day 
transits between Dec. 3 and Feb. 13. Fares for the sailing are $4,295-$5,195 
per person, double occupancy (higher for Christmas week), for a large outside 
cabin without private balcony, $5,795-$6,395 per person, double occupancy, for 
a large outside cabin with private balcony, and $8,495 for a luxurious master 
suite with private balcony. There's an early booking discount of $600-$1,900 
per person, depending on the category of accommodation, for passengers booking 
120 days before sailing, and round-trip air fare from the West Coast is an 
additional $595 per person. Gratuities are included in the fares. 
</P>
<P>
 All cabins are outside rooms and are 243 square feet. Cabins without private 
balcony utilize that space as additional sitting area. Furnishings include 
handsome white leather sofas (cabins with balconies have smaller love seats), 
queen-size or twin beds, TV/VCR, refrigerator and mini-bar, in-room safes and 
marble bath with tub and overhead shower. Complimentary toiletries are also 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 The two master suites are a whopping 522 square feet and have big cushy 
leather sofas, a huge marble bath with Jacuzzi tub and separate stall shower, 
generous closet space and hand-painted wall murals in the style of Henri 
Rousseau. 
</P>
<P>
 The dining room of the Radisson Diamond, the prettiest restaurant at sea, has 
an expansive, high ceiling with a glass wall aft overlooking the sea. In the 
Grill, self-service buffets supplemented by cooked-to-order menu items are 
offered daily at breakfast and lunch. The glass-walled, teak-floored restaurant 
opens onto the pool deck, with a small swimming pool, spa and large outdoor 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Above this deck is a rubberized, non-skid jogging track, a spa, beauty salon, 
fitness center and golf putting area and driving cage. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a photo shop, boutique and gift shop, casino, card rooms, and a 
library with video and book selections. 
</P>

BACKPACK & BUDGET: BACK ON THE BUS -- COMFORTABLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bus travel at its best can mean reclining in a luxurious seat and making new 
friends while exotic settings unfold. At its worst you can find yourself 
thumping down potholed roads in sweltering heat while you struggle to keep your 
sleepy head from slipping onto a stranger's shoulder.Whether you choose to 
travel independently or with a group tour, here are some suggestions to make 
your journey more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 For long journeys in tropical climates the first thing to consider is which 
side of the bus the hot sun will shine on most of the time. If there is a 
ceiling vent, position yourself close to it. 
</P>
<P>
 If you suffer from motion sickness, try to sit close to the front and keep 
your eyes on the horizon. Avoid the seats over the wheels. They will be the 
most bumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 Items that you'll likely find helpful include: bottled drinking water, an 
inflatable neck rest, eye shields for sleeping and earplugs to cut out the 
noise blasting from video machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent travel isn't for everyone, so there are companies offering coach 
tours. Some of the companies also offer travelers the opportunity to camp, 
without having to supply anything more than their own sleeping bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Contiki Holidays, which runs tours in large luxury coaches in Europe, North 
America, Australia and New Zealand, caters to travelers age 18 to 35. 
TrekAmerica runs camping/hotel tours in 13-passenger minibuses in Alaska, 
Canada, the United States and Mexico, for travelers age 18 to 38. 
</P>
<P>
 For information on TrekAmerica, or for copies of its brochure, call (800) 
221-0596. For Contiki Holidays, call (714) 740-0808.

CRUISE: PANAMA CANAL; FAST FACTS ON THE BIG DITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Anne Colby 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On budget: At the time, the Panama Canal was the costliest project in U.S. 
history.It came in $23 million under budget and opened six months early. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirt deficit: More than 232 million cubic yards of rock and dirt were 
excavated from the canal, enough to fill a train circling the earth four times 
at the Equator.  
</P>
<P>
 Mass transit: More than 770,000 vessels have passed through the canal. About 
12,000 ships made the transit last year; 216 were passenger ships carrying 
152,898 people.  
</P>
<P>
 Lake minded: To create Gatun Lake, 164 square miles of jungle and villages (an 
area three times the size of Long Beach) were submerged under water. Anne Colby

 Some of the contenders for election Nov. 8, saying they are fed up with 
business as usual at City Hall, are political novices taking their first stab 
at public office. They will be competing with better-known candidates armed 
with larger campaign accounts and powerful endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who emerge as the top vote-getters will also be forced to contend with 
Anaheim's paramount interests in the proposed expansion of Disneyland and the 
threatened departure of the Los Angeles Rams. The Mayor's Race 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams and Disney issues figure to weigh heavily in the separate race for 
mayor. Incumbent Tom Daly is being challenged by community activist Curtis A. 
Stricker. 
</P>
<P>
 Win or lose, Daly will retain a seat on the council. But if he is elected 
mayor, a third council seat becomes open. In that case, the council would have 
60 days to appoint someone to the position. 
</P>
<P>
 The election quirk is due to a charter amendment passed in 1992 that changed 
the selection process of the city's mayor. Previously, mayoral candidates had 
to be sitting council members and they competed for two-year terms. But 
starting with this election, the mayor will be elected at-large for a four-year 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, a 40-year-old executive of the Building Industry Assn., a builders trade 
group, took over the city's top job in 1992 when he upset two-term Mayor Fred 
Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, a lifelong resident of the city, was on vacation last week and could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he announced his candidacy on the steps of City Hall last month, Daly 
said he would be "pushing hard for economic progress and renewal; for youth 
programs; to renew and strengthen residential neighborhoods and to beautify our 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging Daly is the 66-year-old Stricker, a longtime community activist 
and 25-year city resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "My candidacy is about neighborhoods," said Stricker, a marketing and sales 
consultant. "Stopping crime and having safe neighborhoods is the No. 1 job." 
</P>
<P>
 Stricker, past president of Anaheim HOME (Homeowners Maintaining their 
Environment), said he would like to see issues such as the proposed Disney 
expansion go before the voters in a citywide referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 He would also like to add 200 more officers to the police force and would 
propose stationing them in the city's neighborhoods. The City Council Race 
</P>
<P>
 Several unsuccessful candidates from the past are trying again. They include: 
Bob Zemel, who finished just behind Councilman Frank Feldhaus in 1992; Keith 
Oleson and Phillip Knypstra, who also ran in 1992; and 1988 candidate Jerry R. 
Stoces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Zemel, 41, is a former city planning commissioner and director of the 
Anaheim Chamber of Commerce. He is president of Sea Breeze Mortgage Services, 
Inc. in Anaheim and has lived in the city for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Zemel has been endorsed by fast-food magnate Carl Karcher and several public 
officials, including Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton); state Sens. John R. Lewis 
(R-Orange) and Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove); and Assemblymen Curt Pringle 
(R-Garden Grove) and Mickey Conroy (R-Orange). 
</P>
<P>
 * Oleson, 43, is chairman of the city's Gang/Drug Task Force and heads the 
city's Community Development Block Grant Committee. He is a 10-year resident of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * Knypstra, 57, is a 33-year resident of Anaheim and teaches accounting at El 
Camino College. Earlier this year, he failed in a bid to unseat County 
Supervisor William G. Steiner, whose district includes Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stoces, 28, placed eighth in a field of 11 candidates when he ran for 
council in 1988 as a 22-year-old new college graduate. He is a seven-year 
resident who works as a senior buyer for Hartwell Corp. in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 The council race could bring some racial and gender diversity to the council 
if any of the four female candidates or two Latino candidates are victorious. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis R. Boydstun, Loretta Sanchez Brixey, Sharon A. Ericson and Shirley A. 
McCracken -- all running for the first time -- are seeking election in a city 
that has seen only one woman council member. Miriam Kaywood completed the last 
of her four terms in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boydstun, 62, is a real estate broker who is chairwoman of the city's 
Planning Commission and has lived in the city for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brixey, 34, owns Amiga Advisors, a consulting firm for businesses and 
government agencies. She is active in various civic organization throughout the 
county and has lived in Anaheim for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ericson, 50, is president of the Anaheim Municipal Employees Assn., the 
city's largest union. She has lived in the city for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * McCracken, 57, is chairwoman of the the city's Budget Advisory Commission 
and vice president of the Anaheim Art Council. A resident of the city for 22 
years, she works part-time conducting workshops for churches and community 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brixey or Anaheim Police Officer Lou Lopez are elected, they would be the 
first Latinos to win council seats in a city where 31% of the 290,000 residents 
are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lopez, 50, has been a city police officer for 25 years. He is president of 
the Anaheim City Elementary School District and a member of the Anaheim Union 
High School Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is also a first-time council candidate. Others making their first run 
are: Paul Bostwick, David Keeler, Jeff Kirsch, Leonard Lahtinen, Edward 
Skinner, Mitchell T. Tracy and John Russo. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bostwick, 53, has lived in the city for 38 years and owns a recreational 
vehicle and supply business in Anaheim. He is a board member of the Anaheim 
Chamber of Commerce, board president of the newly formed Orange County 
Conservation Corps and a Community Redevelopment Commission member. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also won the endorsements of Daly, California Angels owners Gene and 
Jackie Autry, Rams Vice President John Shaw, the Chamber of Commerce and the 
city's Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keeler, 44, is an electrical field service engineer who is a 10-year city 
resident. He has been active in the Eastmont Villas Community Assn., serving 
four terms as a board member and one as president. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kirsch, 38, is a self-described political "gadfly." He has lived in the city 
for 10 years and works in electronic sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lahtinen, 60, has served two terms as a trustee on North Orange County 
Community College Board and as a member of the Orange County Grand Jury. He is 
a retired schoolteacher who has lived in Anaheim for more than 30 years. He is 
endorsed by Daly and outgoing Councilman Irv Pickler. 
</P>
<P>
 * Skinner, 49, has lived in the city for nine years. He owns a concrete 
cleaning business and is a past member of the Republican state committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tracy, 31, is running for a council seat in Anaheim for the first time but 
it isn't his first City Council campaign. He ran unsuccessfully for seats on 
the Huntington Beach council in 1988 and in La Habra in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 He has lived in the city for two years and works as assistant program director 
for Kole Vocational Services in Santa Ana.

UCI TAKES SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO FUTURE; EDUCATION: CHANCELLOR HOPES TO ATTRACT 
RESEARCH DOLLARS WITH BIOMEDICINE AND OTHER RISING DISCIPLINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 UC Irvine believes in better living through science. At least that's what some 
faculty members say, as UCI officials increasingly devote their efforts to 
attracting research grants to campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to identify the gene defect that causes dwarfism, or look for the roots 
of Alzheimer's disease? UCI researchers are already seeking those answers, but 
UCI Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening wants more. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Wilkening issued a report declaring her mission to propel UCI into the 
top 50 research institutions in the nation by 2000, and a longer-range vision 
-- suggested by some students, faculty and staff members -- to eventually crack 
the top 30. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tough proposition when top California universities such as UCLA, UC San 
Diego and Stanford are older, more established and competing for the same 
research dollars. But Wilkening will encourage UCI to grow by playing to Orange 
County's strengths and interests in the post-Cold War age: biomedicine and 
medical devices, environmental issues, computers and information science and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have advantages," Wilkening said in a meeting with Times reporters and 
editors Friday. "Other universities have professional schools of agriculture, 
forestry, fisheries. . . . Those are from an era at the beginning of the 
century. We have to look at how we serve important industry, but not do things 
that were good to do 30 years ago."  
</P>
<P>
 UCI researchers will be looking around Southern California and beyond for 
companies that can use the technology they are developing -- and pay them for 
it. The university's Technology Showcase, a first-ever conference held on 
campus Friday morning, was a first step. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 executives and owners of biomedical companies visited UCI for 
the conference, organized by the Life Science Industry Council, a partnership 
between UCI and Southern California biomedical and medical device companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight UCI professors and researchers gave presentations on research at the 
university, which included new cancer therapies, the use of bacteria or fungi 
to change harmful chemicals into harmless materials and techniques for 
preserving human organs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to nourish and expand UCI's relationship with your industry," 
Wilkening told conference attendees. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael W. Berns, surgery professor and director of the Beckman Laser 
Institute and Medical Clinic, showed business people how lasers can be used to 
cut chromosomes in half and manipulate them under a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for partners to commercialize our technology," Berns told them. 
He clicked through slides showing medical center patients whose huge tattoos 
were removed by lasers, and how lasers can drill tiny holes in animal cells to 
extract genetic material.  
</P>
<P>
 Outside UCI's Engineering Quad, business people exchanged cards with UCI 
scientists and checked out UC-ACCESS, a computer system in which companies can 
dial up a University of California database to find out which professors are 
doing research in areas they can apply to their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our success to some degree is going to be linked to a changing of the culture 
at UCI," said Dr. Michael E. Selsted, associate vice chancellor for research. 
"The expectation the campus has of its researchers needs to be raised." 
</P>
<P>
 In the post-Cold War era, with government shying away from military projects, 
researchers are increasingly exploring health, the environment and family 
issues. As funding from state and federal governments evaporates, researchers 
are seeking additional support from the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we look toward the year 2000, it is clear that many of the old models of 
university research development will have to be discarded. There is simply not 
enough federal investment to support the potential for discovery and new 
technology in American universities," Selsted said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening said she expects greater results from information and computer 
science, engineering and particularly the College of Medicine. Officials are 
going ahead with plans for a health center on campus. Construction of the first 
building -- which will house neuroscience research -- is scheduled for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI officials are banking on cancer research as well, anticipating UCI will be 
named a special cancer center by the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilkening has pointed to other areas of excellence she hopes to foster at 
UCI besides sciences. Concern about primary and secondary education has become 
so deep that funding from both government and private grants has skyrocketed, 
she has said. UCI has received about $6.5 million in federal funds for 
education since 1992, much of it from the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some science specialists caution against losing the basic disciplines that 
make up a well-rounded university education, such as humanities, because of a 
stress on research. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a writing program that is world famous at UCI," Selsted said. "It is 
not evaluated on its ability to generate funds, it's based on its intellectual 
product. That should be the case for every academic unit."

PIZZA CASE UNLIKELY FOCUS OF '3 STRIKES' DEBATE; COURTS: DEFENSE LAWYER SAYS 
SUSPECT DOESN'T SEE HOW WHAT HE ALLEGEDLY DID COULD SEND HIM TO PRISON FOR 25 
YEARS TO LIFE. OFFICIALS BACK PROSECUTION OF SMALL-TIME STREET CRIMINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Dewayne Williams hardly seemed destined to become a well-known figure in 
the annals of American crime. 
</P>
<P>
 A small-time street criminal with an almost ludicrous propensity for getting 
caught, Williams until recently was simply an anonymous bit player in the vast 
criminal justice system game, a revolving-door felon who had never done 
anything that society thought was worth more than a short stretch in jail. None 
of his four felonies had ever rated even a single line of newspaper ink, or a 
mention on a news broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 But things have changed for Williams, 27. Now, because of California's new 
"three strikes" law mandating long prison terms for repeat felons, Williams is 
famous -- or infamous -- as the central figure in the so-called Three Strikes 
Pizza Case. He's looking at spending 25 years to life in prison for allegedly 
stealing a slice of pepperoni pizza from four youngsters in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because it revolves around something so mundane -- pizza -- the case 
has attracted widespread attention. It's been the subject of numerous local and 
national newspaper, radio and television news reports. Gov. Pete Wilson and 
California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren have said publicly that they support the 
"three strikes" prosecution in the case. A South Bay-based group called 
Citizens Against Crime has been formed to monitor court proceedings against 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opposite side, the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the 
"three strikes" law, is looking into the case, although the group has not 
decided whether to take any action. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Williams and that slice of pepperoni pizza have become focal points 
in the debate over whether California's "three strikes" law is too Draconian, 
or is instead just what the doctor ordered for a society fed up with crime and 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The case also has taken on racial overtones, with some people, including 
Williams, complaining that it would have been handled differently if not for 
the fact that he is black and his four young alleged victims are white -- a 
charge the district attorney's office vehemently denies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole city . . . sees me as this big black man who's taken food from four 
small white children," Williams, who is 6 feet 4 and weighs about 225 pounds, 
wrote in a letter from jail. "And it was not like that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 To his friends, and to Williams himself, it seems almost impossible that the 
crime in question could carry such punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life? For a piece of pizza?" says Williams' girlfriend, Tina White, who 
shared a house with him in Watts. "That ain't right. There ain't no way that's 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 "He feels like this just can't be true," Williams' lawyer, veteran Deputy 
Public Defender Arnold Lester, says of his client, who has pleaded innocent to 
robbery charges in the case. "He just doesn't understand how what he allegedly 
did could send him to prison for 25 years to life." 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors and supporters of the law take a different view. They say if 
Williams goes to prison for life it won't be just because of the pizza, but 
because of his seemingly chronic inability to stop committing felonies. And 
despite all the publicity, prosecutors say the case against Williams actually 
is routine, simply one of almost 1,000 "three strikes" cases filed in Los 
Angeles County since the law took effect in March.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams, they say, deserves no sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is about a robbery," says Deputy Dist. Atty. Ralph Shapiro, who is 
prosecuting Williams. "It doesn't matter whether it was pizza or anything else. 
Because of his past record, I believe he deserves a substantial prison 
sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he deserves it or not, it's clear that Williams' already troubled life 
took a potentially disastrous turn for the worse one day early last month, when 
Shapiro scrawled three Xs at the top of the case work sheet -- shorthand for 
"three strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 According to friends, Williams grew up in Compton, one of five children in a 
single-parent home. A later probation report said he started smoking marijuana 
at the age of 16 and at age 19 began using cocaine. He worked briefly as a 
laborer and as a kitchen helper at a convalescent home. A rap sheet lists 
arrests in Seattle, where he lived for a time, for vandalism, burglary and 
carrying an unregistered firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' first felony conviction came at the age of 19, when he pleaded 
guilty to drug possession and was sentenced to three years probation. The 
strikes started piling up rapidly after that. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1986, Williams and a friend jumped a Compton man, knocked him 
down, punched him and stole his wallet with $1,100 in it. Williams -- who gave 
police the alias Kevin Dewayne Williamson, the first of several a.k.a.'s -- 
later said the man had ripped off his friend in a drug deal. The man was not 
seriously hurt. Williams pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced to one 
year in County Jail and five years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1989, sheriff's deputies in Lynwood saw Williams riding a stolen 
1988 Honda motorcycle. When they pulled him over, they said Williams told them, 
"I know the bike is stolen, but I didn't steal it." He pleaded guilty to joy 
riding, a felony, and served 225 days in County Jail, with another three years 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1992, Williams was in trouble again, this time for chasing a 
22-year-old man in Compton, knocking him down and trying to pull a gold chain 
from his neck. In what friends say was a more or less typical Williams 
maneuver, he did it right in front of a Compton police sergeant, who arrested 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always got caught whatever he did," says an acquaintance who asked that 
her name not be used. "It was always just dumb things, dumb, dumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams pleaded guilty to attempted robbery, and was sentenced to 16 months 
in state prison. He served eight months and was paroled from the California 
Correctional Center in Susanville in April, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams seemed to be getting things together after his prison term. His 
parole officer later testified that "he was doing good," reporting to the 
parole office regularly and testing clean for drugs. He was released from 
parole early, in April, because of his good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was working every day," says White, his girlfriend, displaying Williams' 
pay stubs from a temporary employment agency. "He was a good guy. We were going 
to get married on his birthday in October." 
</P>
<P>
 Then on July 30, Williams and five friends, including Tina White and her 
sister Tynia White, decided to go to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, shortly before dusk Williams and his friends were walking 
near the Redondo Beach Pier, in an area of small food shops, when Williams and 
another man approached four children who were sitting at an outside table in 
front of Adam's Pizza. The children, Michael Adkins, 12, his brother Terry, 
then 15, both of El Segundo, and their out-of-state cousins Kevin and Amy 
Callahan, ages 10 and 7, were eating an extra large New York-style pepperoni 
pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 At a preliminary hearing last month, Michael testified that Williams' 
companion "said they were starving and asked us for a piece of pizza. . . . My 
brother said, 'Sorry, no you can't,' and they asked again." Then, Michael 
testified, "they reached out, grabbed it and said, 'Thanks.' "  
</P>
<P>
 "Were you scared?" prosecutor Shapiro asked him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes . . . because they were much bigger than me," Michael testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' friends tell a different story.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were just fooling around, you know," Tynia White says. "Jerry asked the 
boy if he could have a piece of pizza and the kid said yes. Jerry took the 
pizza, but then he threw it away because he doesn't eat pork." 
</P>
<P>
 "If he eats pork he faints," Tina White added. 
</P>
<P>
 After the men walked away from the table, the pizza shop manager called 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I knew he (Williams) would go for life, maybe I would have thought twice 
about calling the police," the manager, who declined to be identified by name, 
said later. "I don't know if he should go for life. But he needs to be taught a 
lesson not to do this to children. They were small kids, and he's a big guy. 
They were scared." 
</P>
<P>
 After police arrived, Michael Adkins pointed out Williams at a nearby video 
arcade; the other man was not identified. Tynia White says the group offered to 
pay for the pizza, but the police arrested Williams anyway. According to 
prosecutor Shapiro, Williams gave police the alias Lafayette Eddie Hicks. 
Williams is being held in County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Lester believes the whole thing was blown out of proportion 
-- perhaps because of race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling if it had been a white person, or if it was a black guy and 
black kids in Compton, the police would have treated the matter differently," 
Lester says. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are given some leeway in handling "three strikes" cases. For 
example, in another recent South Bay case a man accused of stealing some 
underwear for his daughter was charged with breaking the "three strikes" law 
because he had been convicted of felonies in 1975 and 1979. Because the prior 
convictions were so old, however, prosecutors dropped one of the strikes in a 
plea bargain. The man still got 32 months in prison under the "second strike" 
provision of the law, which defense attorneys say was far more than he would 
have gotten before "three strikes" was passed. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is the exception, Shapiro says. When Redondo Beach police brought the 
Williams case to his office shortly after the arrest, he says, it was an easy 
"three strikes" call. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been the district attorney's position that ('three strikes') is the 
law and we're going to enforce it," Shapiro said. "The facts of the case 
indicated it was a robbery, which is a felony; he had serious priors, he had 
just gotten off parole. . . . It was almost automatic. . . . I put three Xs at 
the top of the work sheet." 
</P>
<P>
 After a preliminary hearing, a Torrance judge ordered Williams held for trial 
on two counts of second-degree robbery and one count of felony petty theft with 
a prior. A pretrial hearing in the case is scheduled for Thursday.

ARMING RESIDENTS WITH NEW OUTLOOK ON POLICE WORK; TRAINING: COURSE FAMILIARIZES 
PEOPLE WITH LAPD OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ARREST PROCEDURES, USE OF FORCE AND 
SHOOTING POLICIES. 'THE MOST SURPRISING THING I LEARNED IS THAT POLICE ARE 
HUMAN,' A GRADUATE SAYS.

 At the academy, her police instructor nicknamed her Annie Oakley because of 
her quick aim on the firing range. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ruby Maillian promises she'll be just as fast with a rebuttal from now on 
when she hears people bad-mouthing the Los Angeles Police Department in her 
neighborhood near Florence and Normandie avenues -- a flash point of the 1992 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Maillian was among the first 66 graduates Saturday of the department's 
Community Police Academy -- part of the community-based policing overhaul of 
the LAPD launched after the beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 30-hour curriculum -- which includes the computer-simulated target-pistol 
demonstration that Maillian excelled at -- is designed to familiarize city 
residents with police operations. It covers such things as arrest procedures, 
use of force and shooting policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduates won't be armed and won't carry badges. But they will be equipped to 
help put an end to myths that circulate about the police in some communities, 
Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're armed with the facts at a time when misinterpretation can drive 
communities apart," he told graduates as they received diplomas in a ceremony 
at the Police Academy near Downtown.

 Police Capt. Alan Kerstein said: "When you're in a supermarket line and you 
hear somebody say, 'They didn't need to handcuff that man like they did,' 
you'll be able to talk intelligently and with firsthand experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Misconceptions about the police abound, graduates acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most common in my area is that you can never get a police officer to come 
when you call," said Raymond Boykin, 50, a disabled South-Central maintenance 
man. "I'll tell them calls are taken by priority, that if you call about a 
trash can it's one thing, but if you call about a man with a gun it's another." 
</P>
<P>
 Some also feel that police come into the community to harass residents, Boykin 
added. "No, they come to solve problems: The most surprising thing I learned is 
that police are human." 
</P>
<P>
 Watts resident Barbara Kennedy, 35, said the course cleared up a few of her 
own misconceptions -- "like when somebody dies, why they leave them so long on 
the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, she learned, is that homicide investigations require such 
time-consuming procedures as evidence gathering and crime scene photography. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an anti-police attitude in my community. Maybe I can open some eyes," 
said Kennedy, a jobs placement coordinator who lives in the Imperial Courts 
housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a different attitude about police now. A better attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they intend for the academy to be an ongoing program. They hope 
to expand it next spring to the San Fernando Valley, the Westside and Central 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to put everyone in L.A. through this," Kerstein said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If implemented citywide, the Community Police Academy could become a 
centerpiece of the department's move toward community-based policing, which 
focuses on preventing crime rather than simply arresting criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Such efforts can be traced to the 1970s, when then-Chief Ed Davis established 
Neighborhood Watch and began experimenting with a policing program called the 
"basic car plan" that assigned specific officers to neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Those programs were de-emphasized in the 1980s by his successor, Daryl F. 
Gates, who favored a tougher, sometimes militaristic style of law enforcement. 
After the beating of King, the riots and Gates' departure, Chief Willie L. 
Williams revived the community-based policing concept. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Williams revealed his blueprint for community policing, which 
focused on new citizen involvement in the department, including the use of 
community councils, advisory panels and citizen volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's graduates said the Community Police Academy course has convinced 
them to sign up as department volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not enough policemen out here. There's a lot of work they do that we 
should be doing," said Raymond Clark, a 37-year-old automotive parts salesman 
from Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Terrell, 48, a resource information specialist from South-Central, said: 
"We'll put civilians on the inside and officers on the outside. I'm willing to 
do paperwork, to participate any way I can to get officers on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of friends and family members watched Maillian, 64, receive her 
Community Police Academy diploma from Chief Williams. "This will go on the wall 
at the 'national gallery of art' at my house," she joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Maillian said she has supported the police since 1968 -- when Officer Oscar 
Joel Bryant was shot to death while arresting four suspected robbers near her 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put the command post by my house," Maillian said. "This was before 
Winchell's began giving away doughnuts to police. My husband and I fixed tuna 
sandwiches, coffee and cocoa for the police." 
</P>
<P>
 But Maillian emphasized that she will not hesitate to criticize police if she 
feels it's necessary. "If a policeman is out of line, I'll be the first one to 
speak up," she promised. 
</P>
<P>
 That suits Williams fine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not cheerleaders," he said of the graduates. "They'll tell us when 
we're wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a chance for us to listen to our customers. Our constituents."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: SHIELDING SIMPSON JURY SELECTION IN NAME OF 
EFFICIENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many people wonder how much more of a circus the Simpson case could become. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Los Angeles Superior Court's 22-page "media plan" for the O.J. Simpson 
murder trial is any indication, the folks who prepared it are expecting the 
overblown coverage to explode in size and intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the guide is an attempt to impose discipline on traditionally 
anarchic reporters. For example, it says, "If a press representative who has 
been assigned a seat (in the courtroom) does not claim it within 15 minutes 
after court convenes for each morning and each afternoon session, the seat will 
be given to another press representative." 
</P>
<P>
 I was more interested in a section that provides a list of places to eat and 
drink Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Among places near the Criminal Courts Building was the Epicentre, where a lot 
of Times reporters and editors eat and drink. I like the Epicentre. But the 
authors should have also listed the Redwood on 2nd Street, a hangout for 
generations of trial and crime reporters, criminal lawyers and bail bondsmen 
who continue to exchange gossip and facts over its well-worn bar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also contains a section that is stirring more serious controversy -- 
a section that The Times is now urging Judge Lance A. Ito to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito, who is presiding over the Simpson case, has sharply restricted the 
presence of the press in the courtroom during jury selection, which begins 
Sept. 26. Only one reporter, respected trial reporter Linda Deutsch of 
Associated Press, will be allowed to actually observe the lengthy jury 
selection process. She will pass along her observations to other members of the 
press, who will be able to listen to the proceeding in a courthouse press room. 
</P>
<P>
 For the public at large, jury selection will not be broadcast in any form. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerrianne Hayslett, a court public affairs official, said the judge imposed 
the restriction because there is limited space in the small courtroom. "There 
is a large jury pool. The judge wants to get in as many prospective jurors in 
the courtroom as possible," Hayslett said. "He is even adding chairs in the 
courtroom. There will be no member of the public present. The one reporter will 
represent the public via the media." 
</P>
<P>
 In some respects, I can see the judge's side. The first 250 people in the 
Simpson jury pool will report to the Criminal Courts Building jury assembly 
room at 8:30 a.m. Sept. 26. They'll be hustled up to the courtroom in groups 
for questioning that will eliminate most of them. Ito, who has summoned a pool 
of 1,000 potential jurors, wants to work his way through the questioning as 
quickly as he can. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another side to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although efficiency is the judge's stated motive, his limit on coverage could 
also be interpreted as another in a continuing judicial effort to shield jurors 
from the outside world and to protect them from the intrusive and upsetting 
media circus. 
</P>
<P>
 The juror protection movement started several years ago, about the same time 
TV gained access to covering trials. The movement gained impetus when violent 
crime became a major public issue and some jurors expressed fear of reprisal 
from outraged friends and relatives of defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fears are expressed in a new movie, "Trial by Jury," which tells the 
story of a juror in a trial of a murderous gangster. The gangster's crew 
threatens to harm her 7-year-old son unless she votes not guilty and persuades 
some of her fellow jurors to go along. 
</P>
<P>
 The juror protection movement has really taken hold in the southeastern Los 
Angeles County communities of Downey and Bellflower. There, two Municipal Court 
judges have issued orders forbidding the release of names of jurors in all 
criminal trials. The court clerks know the names, but to everyone else the 
jurors are known by the numbers on their badges. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors have been given the protection of anonymity in cases in which the judge 
thinks they are in danger. It happened in the Rodney G. King beating trial and 
the trials of the men accused of beating Reginald O. Denny. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that judges are imposing anonymity in every criminal case in 
Downey and Bellflower shows how far the juror protection movement has gone. As 
one lawyer told Times writer Catherine Gewertz, "I tried a death penalty (case) 
in Downtown recently and they didn't have an anonymous jury there. And here I 
am in Bellflower, representing a prominent surgeon for driving under the 
influence, and they want to use an anonymous jury. My client wasn't a dangerous 
guy who was some threat to the jury. It was ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to sympathize with nervous jurors. With the inconvenience, low pay 
and bad working conditions the county heaps on jurors and prospective jurors, 
the added fear of getting beat up by a defendant's relatives is too much. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also easy to understand a juror's fear of the media frenzy overwhelming 
the Simpson trial. You've seen those scenes in movies where hysterical 
reporters and TV crews chase people down corridors and streets? They're not an 
exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ito said he is limiting media access to jury selection in the name of 
efficiency. But even if he doesn't intend it that way, his order will limit 
what the public knows about the Simpson jury selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, limiting reporters' access will drive them to heights of rudeness 
-- and ingenuity in getting their stories -- never envisioned by the authors of 
the Superior Court's media guide.

NEIGHBORS SAY MAN'S HOME IS A CASTLE; REAL ESTATE: HOMEOWNER DRAWS COMPLAINTS 
BUT SAYS HE UPGRADED NEIGHBORHOOD. CITY CONSIDERS ORDINANCE TO CURB 
'MANSIONIZATION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mehdi Yazdi's dream home is a Mediterranean-style mansion that could blend 
easily into the tony neighborhoods of Brentwood or Beverly Hills, with six 
bedrooms, an entryway nearly 35 feet high and a gold-plated mailbox out front. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a hillside cul-de-sac in Burbank, where most homes are much smaller, 
the mansion stands out like an overdressed guest at a casual party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful home. It'll overwhelm you," said Louise Penn, a real estate 
broker who lives adjacent to the mansion. "As you go around the corner, it's 
like, 'Whew! Where did this come from?' It's a tremendously large home on a 
small lot." 
</P>
<P>
 As Yazdi's next-door neighbor, Meiko Powers, put it: "These lots were not 
designed for huge, huge homes. We'd literally be on top of each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Southland in recent years, many municipal governments have grappled 
with the problem of "mansionization," or the building of houses so large they 
are out of character for their neighborhoods. Cities such as Los Angeles, 
Glendale and Pasadena have written ordinances aimed at controlling it. 
</P>
<P>
 The next may be Burbank, where the City Council is considering tightening 
restrictions on single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The central issue is how to balance the rights of property owners with the 
interests of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank city planners theorize that mansionization stems from homeowners' 
desire to expand their existing house rather than buy a new one and real estate 
investors' hopes of turning a profit by making additions to smaller houses. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one expert outside of Burbank is puzzled by the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tend to group themselves by income. They don't want to be pointed out 
as the rich people or poor people on the block. They don't want their neighbors 
to be so different in lifestyle that they are far better or worse than they 
are," said George Lefcoe, a professor of real estate law at USC.  
</P>
<P>
 Mansionization, he added, is "very surprising, counter-intuitive thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 For Yazdi, an electronic parts manufacturer, expanding his old 
1,700-square-foot house made sense because he could save money by doing most of 
the work himself. 
</P>
<P>
 His single-story, three-bedroom home had been purchased for $285,000 in 1988 
and was about half the size of his next-door neighbor's. 
</P>
<P>
 With approval from city officials to do substantial remodeling, Yazdi built a 
two-story, 5,500-square-foot house that was completed in May -- work that 
typically costs about $1 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I upgraded the neighborhood," the 40-year-old father of two said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were gonna appreciate me. I put something nice in the 
neighborhood. I was surprised when (neighbors) reacted that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors complain that the house, considered to be a standard size in some 
neighborhoods but a mansion in this one, blocks their hilltop views and gives 
Yazdi's family an unobstructed peek into their back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, Burbank's anti-mansionization ordinance would impose height 
limits of 35 feet on new houses along hillsides in northeast Burbank and 27 
feet in the rest of the city, making it impossible for homes taller than 
Yazdi's to be built without a conditional-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would also limit the size a new house can be in proportion to 
its lot. Presently, there is no such restriction and the height limit for all 
single-family houses is 35 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will discuss the ordinance again Nov. 8, after the matter was 
postponed from a Sept. 13 meeting. At that time, Councilman Robert Bowne 
questioned the need for such a measure in a city with few houses 35 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really believe there's a big enough case to be made that this is a 
big enough problem in Burbank," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Planner Rick Pruetz acknowledged Bowne's point: "It certainly isn't a 
problem like it's been in certain communities like Beverly Hills, though we've 
had big houses go up where we've received negative comments." 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to control mansionization have worked well in Pasadena, where city 
planners say most people are complying with the stricter building requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Los Angeles, which has tried to control mansionization since June, it's 
too early to tell, said Planning Associate Steve Ciccarelli. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows what the socio-economical reasons are for going to larger homes?" 
he said. "But for years, people didn't maximize the potential development of 
their property." 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Lefcoe says he can't understand why people are doing so now. 
</P>
<P>
 Current housing prices, he said, make it far cheaper to purchase a new house 
rather than adding on to an existing one. And it will be difficult for the 
owner of an oversize house to sell it unless he or she can find someone willing 
to stand out in a neighborhood, he added.

A BROAD PALATE; TASTE OF ENCINO SHOWCASES RESTAURANTS, WINERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For those who sampled the tastes at the seventh annual Taste of Encino, 
Saturday was a lovely day. The sun was shining, the crowds weren't too bad and 
they could pile their plates with pickings from 25 San Fernando Valley 
restaurants and six wineries. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those who cooked all that food over open grills, with smoke in their 
eyes and the sun on their necks, Saturday was just plain hot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on my second shirt -- I sweat through the first one," said Linda Fay as 
she grilled 10 of the 500 marinated chicken kabobs the Pango Pango catering 
service had prepared to sell Saturday. "It's very warm." 
</P>
<P>
 The first person assigned to do the grilling gave up midway through the 
afternoon, Fay said, pointing to a man sleeping in the shady bushes behind the 
booth. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither the cooks nor the organizers nor the 8,000 to 10,000 attendees 
were complaining too loudly -- and not just because their mouths were full. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood restaurants, selling just-more-than-bite-sized portions for $1 to 
$3, got a chance to tempt the palates of potential customers. Area schools, the 
beneficiaries of the Encino Chamber of Commerce-sponsored event, will get 
much-needed supplies from wish lists submitted to the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 And visitors got a whole lot of food -- everything from chicken tandoori at 
Taj Mahal Cuisine of India to shredded chicken salad at Chin Chin to gnocchi 
from Viva la Pasta to artichoke-and-spinach dip from the Beachhead Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Mack of North Hills licked his fingers after polishing off a plate of 
ribs from Adam's Rib and declared that he wanted to try everything. Having run 
through his first set of 10 $1 tickets, Mack said, he was planning to head back 
to the ticket booth for 10 more. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a taste of the Valley," he said. "You've got all these 
different foods, ambience, a wonderful mixture of different lifestyles. It's 
just one great big bite."  
</P>
<P>
 Rib cook Luis Zarate has been a chef at Adam's for 14 years, he said. Even 
with steaming barbecue sauce dripping on his hands and sweat running into his 
eyes, Zarate smiled when some customers sneaked behind the tent for extra 
condiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should be in our kitchen," he said. "This is kind of like a break." 
</P>
<P>
 The Taste also offered live music, children's shows and a chance to meet other 
Angelenos -- the limited number of umbrella-covered tables forced folks to 
double up. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Howard, who came to the event from Beverly Hills with his girlfriend and 
daughter, sought refuge from the heat at a table already occupied by a mother 
and daughter from Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sun makes everyone really friendly," Howard explained. "You have to share 
the shade." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival continues today at the Courtyard Shops of Encino, 17401 Ventura 
Blvd., from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. with food, drinks and entertainment. Admission is 
$2, $1 for senior citizens and free for children under 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham High School, Taft High School, Zane Grey High School, Emelita 
Street Elementary, Encino Elementary, Nestle Avenue Elementary and Mulholland 
Middle School will benefit from this year's event.

SCOTT HARRIS: ON THE TABLE: PAY CAPS AND THINKING CAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metaphors and me, we go way back, though it took me a while to catch on. 
"People who live in glass houses," my mom would say, "shouldn't throw stones." 
Why, I wondered, would anyone live in a glass house? Couldn't the neighbors see 
you in the bathroom? 
</P>
<P>
 Mom also talked about "saving for a rainy day." This seemed odd. When it's 
raining out, wouldn't you rather stay warm and dry? Wouldn't you rather shop on 
a sunny day? 
</P>
<P>
 Something about rainy days reminds me of the standing dinner orders: Clean 
Your Plate. "Children are starving in Europe," Mom would say. Now, this isn't a 
metaphor, but it was equally hard to understand her point. Like every kid 
steeped in the moral greatness of the American character and the wonders of 
Yankee ingenuity, I wondered why we didn't just build a pipeline that would 
redistribute leftover vegetables to the world's hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason -- I'm still trying to figure out why -- glass houses, rainy 
days and hungry children came to mind after a visit the other night to the 
headquarters of the United Teachers-Los Angeles (UTLA). The sorry state of 
public education -- the declining finances, sagging academic performance -- 
might evoke rainy days and hungry children. As for glass houses, it must have 
been the purpose of the visit: I was curious whether they could identify with 
their unlikely brothers in organized labor -- the striking Major League 
Baseball Players Assn. It's funny to hear players and owners accuse each other 
of greed. 
</P>
<P>
 I was wondering whether L.A. teachers, folks who last year made an average 
salary of $39,600, could relate to people who last year made an average salary 
of $1.2 million. The players union says it's unfair to cite the average salary. 
Well, fine. Could teachers identify with folks who have a median income of 
$410,000 per year? Even the poorest major leaguer makes $109,000. 
</P>
<P>
 My survey was not scientific. At a table labeled "East Valley," three teachers 
were opening envelopes and counting ballots in the culmination of voting to 
decide whether to accept a one-year contract that would restore 8% of the 10% 
pay cut Los Angeles teachers absorbed during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly feel that every group of working people has the right to withhold 
services in collective bargaining," said Lila Dawson-Weber, a special-education 
teacher at Fulton Middle School and a lifelong Dodger fan. "So I'm supportive 
of them in that respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, naturally. Would we expect anything else in a gathering of union 
officers? Dawson-Weber shared the table with Loretta Toggenburger, a 
first-grade teacher at Hazeltine Elementary, and Jay Winters, a science teacher 
at San Fernando High. The trio represent the East Valley on the UTLA board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 But, they agreed, there was little comparison to be made between their own 
labor disputes with the school district and the baseball strike. If you divide 
the world between the haves and the have-nots, baseball's problem is a feud 
between the haves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the have-nots," Dawson-Weber said as she counted ballots. "Neither 
side has any money. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I have no problem with the fact there is a strike," she said. "My problem is 
with the different attitudes in the media and the public. The public and the 
media are more concerned about what's happening with them than what is 
happening in our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 There were nods of agreement all around. A society that is fascinated with 
celebrity is interested only intermittently in public education. Winters points 
out that the media also have judged the O. J. Simpson murder case to be more 
newsworthy than public education. 
</P>
<P>
 This is especially troubling, Winters said, with Proposition 187 coming up, 
the initiative that would bar the children of illegal immigrants from schools. 
Winters said he's heard that it may affect up to 25% of students in Los Angeles 
schools. And since school funding is based on average daily attendance, Winters 
fears that passage of Proposition 187 would lead to massive layoffs of 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a possibility I hadn't considered. A more likely scenario, it seems, is 
that Proposition 187 would at least fuel an industry in false documents. All 
considered, phony papers may be better than the increased crime that would 
result from putting thousands and thousands of juveniles on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But I digress. I wasn't there to talk about meaningful issues. As a 
representative of the media, I wanted to talk about baseball, and the lack 
thereof. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the Dodgers owe me money -- a refund on some tickets that I can't 
use. Dawson-Weber mentioned that she and her husband were supposed to attend a 
game this summer, but had to give them up because they became involved in 
preparations for a possible teachers strike. 
</P>
<P>
 That possibility, you may know, was averted. By an overwhelming margin, 
teachers accepted the 8% restoration of their pay cut. That means the average 
salary will be more than $43,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Toggenburger, who's been a teacher for more than 40 years and has raised eight 
children of her own, seems to be looking forward to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike professional athletes, who are role models at a distance, teachers are 
role models in the flesh. And Toggenburger wants people to remember that it 
isn't only about money. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come into the first grade and they don't read. They leave and they're 
reading," she said. "That's the pay."

MAIMED YOUTH CHEERED BY FLOOD OF MAIL AND GIFTS

<P>
 The condition of a 10-year-old boy from Orange, whose aunt has been charged 
with beating him nearly to death, was upgraded from fair to good Saturday at 
Children's Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, who was fitted with a colostomy bag after being rushed to the 
hospital last week, was in good spirits, buoyed by an avalanche of gifts and 
cards from well-wishers, said Andrea Pronk, hospital spokeswoman,  
</P>
<P>
 "He's just thrilled with everything," Pronk said. "He reads the cards first, 
front and back, then he'll say something like 'Oh, cool!' or 'I know that 
person.' It's really cheering him up." 
</P>
<P>
 Three Costa Mesa girls, 9, 10 and 11, sent the boy a letter Saturday that 
read: "Dear 10-year-old, We heard about what happened to you. If we were there 
we would have helped you. . . . We want you to know we care about you. . . . If 
you need someone to talk to just write to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The girls gave their addresses and enclosed a Mighty Duck POG, a bubble gum 
sucker, a piece of gum and $4, Pronk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the day after the boy's story appeared in local newspapers, 100 people 
left messages on the hospital's answering machine, Pronk said. Another 50 had 
called in by 3 p.m. Saturday. Many wanted to donate to a trust fund set up for 
the child. Others said they were simply sickened and wanted to do something, 
Pronk said. Three people have offered to serve as foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been calling all these people back, and every time I talk to one of them 
I feel like crying," Pronk said. "They want to do whatever they can to help 
him. People are saying, 'We don't know what to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital workers carefully checked the gifts that continued to pour in 
Saturday, including a remote-controlled Porsche, a Ninja Turtle art set and a 
souvenir Nolan Ryan baseball. The boy gave one plastic toy car designed for a 
much younger child to a hospital worker to give to another boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's biological father visited him Friday, Pronk said. But she did not 
know if he had been allowed to see his son. Since he was an infant, the boy has 
lived with his aunt and uncle, Cynthia and Edward Medina. Cynthia Medina has 
been charged with four felony counts of child abuse and one count of torture in 
connection with the beating, burning and sodomizing of her nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 Pronk said she did not know when the boy would be released from the hospital. 
Those interested in making a donation to a trust fund set up for the boy can 
send it to OC Cares Trust Fund, Orange National Bank, P.O. Box 6040, Orange, CA 
92667.

THE COAST IS CLEAR, FOR A DAY; 4,538 VOLUNTEERS TAKE AWAY 22 TONS OF TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Peggy Blanchard goes kayaking in Newport Back Bay, she has noticed with 
distress that trash often floats along the rim of that estuary at high tide, 
sinking into the mud as the tide retreats. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, she was on her knees beside the bay, pushing back the pickle weed 
and pulling out those Styrofoam cups and bottle caps that have sullied one of 
her favorite haunts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never buy Styrofoam again," vowed the 50-year-old Long Beach woman, who 
was among the 4,538 volunteers taking part in the 10th annual Coastal Cleanup 
Day in Orange County. By day's end, they had cleared 45,000 pounds of trash, 
more than 22 tons, and almost 6,000 pounds of recyclable plastics, aluminum and 
glass from the county's beaches and estuaries, as well as the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The countywide volunteer force was larger than last year's, when 3,969 people 
collected 43,076 pounds of trash and 4,795 pounds of recyclable material. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most intriguing discoveries were a sofa and a bed found hidden in 
the brush along the shoulders of Newport Back Bay, auto parts dug out of the 
sand along the surf line at Huntington State Beach and the soggy wallet of a 
Laguna Beach maintenance worker, still containing identification and credit 
cards, that was plucked from the ocean bottom by a scuba diver scavenging off 
Laguna's Main Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 "That is wild," said Kurt Bladergroen, when he learned his wallet had been 
discovered. He said he lost it eight or nine months ago when he was walking his 
dog on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But the throngs of trash hunters also found plenty of more mundane plastic 
food wrappings, cigarette butts, straws, cans and buckets of discarded oil and 
tar -- all of which create an eyesore and can threaten the lives of fish, birds 
and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clear plastic looks a lot like jellyfish to some sea animals, so you 
sometimes find turtles and some fish and sea birds dead with plastic clogging 
their stomachs," said Al Hornsby, a member of the Professional Assn. of Diving 
Instructors. A group from that organization spent Saturday morning combing the 
ocean depths along the Laguna Beach shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual cleanup event, sponsored statewide by the California Coastal 
Commission, can only put a dent in the trash that pollutes the ocean and 
beaches. But its organizers say they hope it will teach children not to throw 
anything from boats or into drains and streams that flow to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event was promoted by many organizations and businesses, including 
Southern California Edison Co. and Shell Oil, both of which sent employees to 
several cleanup sites. Other companies such as the McDonald's restaurant chain 
provided refreshments.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite a power outage, BJ's Pizza in San Juan Capistrano delivered 200 pizza 
slices to about 350 volunteers at Doheny State Beach, said Ed Neely, a member 
of the Doheny Longboard Surfing Assn., which managed the cleanup there. 
</P>
<P>
 Neely said some trash cullers decided to concentrate their efforts on San Juan 
Creek, which flows into the ocean at Doheny State Beach. "They brought out a 
couple of shopping carts, grimy oil cans, clothing and a lot of aluminum cans," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers labored at 21 seaside locations, with the largest turnout of 1,750 
workers at Newport Back Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Thomas, 32, said she and her dog, Gracie, showed up because "we walk 
here every day, and so she has a vested interest. We just love the bay. It's a 
beautiful area." 
</P>
<P>
 The change in the bay and Orange County over the last decade is reflected in 
the records of the annual cleanup, said Jeff Blomstrom, 28, a volunteer with 
the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, there were orchards in the area and they found a lot of 
oranges, and now it is tennis balls," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the volunteers were high school students expecting to get credit for 
classes or to accumulate "community service hours" that would look good on the 
transcripts they send to college admissions offices. Some said the experience 
was an eye-opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is pretty amazing so much trash gets washed up here," said Wes Hansen, a 
junior at University High School in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 George Snider, 65, a member of the Orange County Park Ranger Reserves, who was 
one of the many people helping to coordinate the Back Bay volunteers, said some 
of the younger trash collectors were especially proud of their finds. 
</P>
<P>
 "One little boy claimed he found a dinosaur bone, but it looked more like a 
chicken bone to me," Snider said.

FROM THE GROUND UP; REBUILDING THE NORTHRIDGE FASHION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the construction workers at the Northridge Fashion Center, the Jan. 17 
earthquake is more than just a memory as they busily rebuild the 
1.5-million-square-foot structure that was shaken to its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 After initial images of the mall's flattened garage and crumpled walls were 
beamed across the country, and after crews began to examine the damage, the 
mall's owner -- MEPC American Properties of Dallas -- announced there was more 
damage than originally suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 The task of rebuilding is squarely in the hands of the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter Genaro Topete, above, adjusts reinforcing steel bars in a side wall 
of the Fashion Center's new southwest parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Far left, ironworkers Roland Bubion, left, and Juan Arcos fasten the frame of 
a prefabricated wall for the parking structure.  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Pico, left, welds seismic reinforcements for the steel frame of the new 
Bullock's department store. 
</P>
<P>
 And Javier Hernandez, below left, and Scott Wardlow put the finishing touches 
on the parking structure's freshly poured concrete.  
</P>
<P>
 Although early estimates put the mall's reopening in November, it seems that 
only two anchor stores -- The Broadway and Sears -- will be ready in time for 
the holiday shopping season. The rest of the mall is now scheduled to open in 
the spring.

GOP CONVENTION TURNS INTO LOVE FEST; POLITICS: CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS VOICE 
NO FAULT WITH CANDIDATES WILSON AND HUFFINGTON. EARLIER ACRIMONY IS SWEPT 
ASIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For many Orange County Republicans attending the state GOP convention this 
weekend, Pete Wilson never looked so good. 
</P>
<P>
 As he mounted the stage Saturday to the cheers of "four more years!" there 
were no public signs that Orange County conservatives were anything but 
satisfied with their governor's reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone from this gathering were the acrimonious debates of recent meetings that 
pitted the conservatives against the "Wilson moderates" -- and earlier this 
year, against the U.S. Senate campaign of Michael Huffington, the millionaire 
Republican congressman from Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been silenced" for the sake of party unity, one local conservative 
privately conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 So they gathered for what became a giant unity rally, kept their objections to 
themselves, and even allowed their usual frowns for Wilson and Huffington to 
turn into smiles, for one very big reason: they sense a GOP victory on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 After turning their backs on President George Bush two years ago because of 
ideological differences, Orange County Republicans have learned they do not 
like to lose, even if it means giving in to the moderates in the party. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) said that when it comes to party unity, 
"we conservatives do more than our fair share." 
</P>
<P>
 In the corridors of the convention hotel, the T-shirts and campaign buttons 
and GOP flyers offered signs that the enemies of all Republicans this fall are 
not Wilson and Huffington, but President Clinton, and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the ashes of the 1992 presidential defeat, we learned that we had to 
look at each other in a new dimension," said the Rev. Lou Sheldon, an Orange 
County conservative. "People like Mike Huffington, when compared with (U.S. 
Sen.) Dianne Feinstein, definitely is our choice. We have learned not to look 
for the perfect candidate, but for the candidate that's the best." 
</P>
<P>
 So optimistic are Orange County Republicans about the election that, for the 
first time, Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) feels he can honestly 
recommend to party members that they vote for every single GOP nominee on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want a change, pull a straight Republican ticket, even if you have to 
hold your nose," Conroy said, conceding he has not always followed his own 
advice, but will this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) said that, to his surprise, he has 
seen conservative Orange County women who sat out in 1992 return as volunteers 
for the statewide campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the governor is not their man, so to speak, they have conditioned 
themselves over two years now to work for him," Ferguson added. 
</P>
<P>
 State GOP Chairman Tirso del Junco predicted Wilson will carry Orange County 
by more than the 2-to-1 margin needed to offset Democratic strongholds in other 
parts of the state, and defeat Democrat Kathleen Brown by "six or seven 
points." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times poll released last week showed that among likely voters 
statewide, Wilson had a 9-point lead over Brown -- 50% to 41%. 
</P>
<P>
 But a UC Irvine poll released two weeks ago concluded that while the governor 
had a 22-point lead over Brown among likely Orange County voters, he did not 
yet have enough local support to guarantee a statewide victory. 
</P>
<P>
 That point was not lost on Brown, who campaigned in Orange County on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The polls show that Pete Wilson is in deep trouble in his own base and these 
troubles are not going to go away," Brown said. "They are going to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's early disaffection with Wilson showed in the June primary when 
43% of local Republicans voted for Wilson's opponent, computer businessman and 
political neophyte Ron Unz. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has repaired his standing strongly," Del Junco said of Wilson. "If you 
would survey people today, you would see they have forgotten who Ron Unz was." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Junco said the biggest problem facing the GOP now is not party disunity, 
but voter apathy. 
</P>
<P>
 And the get-out-the-vote campaign may be one area where Wilson can best help 
himself, local party leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The local GOP central committee has budgeted $324,000 for the November 
election campaign, with contributions requested from the conservative Lincoln 
Club of Orange County, the state Republican Party and the campaigns of 
Huffington and Wilson. All of the parties, except for the Wilson campaign, have 
donated money or made down payments on their pledges to contribute. 
</P>

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
BICAMERAL CANDIDATE RUNS BACK AND FORTH IN TWO CAMPAIGNS AT ONCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost like seeing Elvis: In some quarters, rumors of Elvis Presley sightings 
grab attention. But in the Newport Beach area, sightings of Assemblyman Ross 
Johnson (R-Fullerton) are turning heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rarely seen Johnson is running for reelection in his north Orange 
County district, he has been campaigning for the coastal Orange County state 
Senate seat that Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) will be vacating in January 
when she moves to the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though a special election to fill Bergeson's seat is still about six 
months away, Johnson is preparing to take on two Assembly members in the 35th 
Senate District race -- Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who did not seek 
reelection because he plans to run for Bergeson's seat, and Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress), who is frequently mentioned as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Johnson attended a fund-raiser for Republican U.S. Senate candidate 
Mike Huffington, and the week before, he was working the crowd at a Newport 
Beach fund-raiser for Republican Assembly candidate Marilyn C. Brewer. He has 
also scheduled a private meeting with some Newport Beach abortion rights 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his state Senate candidacy, Johnson replied: "I'm not talking 
about that yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, word on the street is that Bergeson will endorse Johnson when the 
time is right. Bergeson said she won't announce her endorsement until after the 
Nov. 8 election. However, she added, "I think Ross is an excellent candidate." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Crime fighters: With Gov. Pete Wilson grabbing all the headlines for his 
anti-crime positions, what's happened to Republican state Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the question being raised by the campaign of Democratic challenger Tom 
Umberg, which is distributing information from recent polls, showing that 
Lungren's support is in the mid-30s, and only between 10 and 15 points ahead of 
Umberg. George Urch, Umberg's campaign manager, claims the relatively low 
support for Lungren means the voters do not have a solid sense of his record. 
</P>
<P>
 But Umberg isn't very well-known either -- his numbers are in the mid-20s -- 
and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown is losing political 
ground at the top of the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Urch claims Umberg's record has more appeal than Brown's; their biggest 
problem is getting voters' attention. "That's our challenge," Urch said, "but 
it puts us on equal footing (with Lungren). . . . We can paint a picture of him 
that's less than perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The slugfest continues: Umberg's departure from the 69th Assembly District has 
set up one of the biggest free-for-alls in the state, and events last week 
showed just how big. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Assembly leader Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) was the featured 
guest at a fund-raiser for Republican nominee Jim Morrissey, as the GOP 
continues building what is expected to be a $450,000 war chest for Morrissey 
for the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) also caused a flare-up when he proposed 
that volunteer poll watchers be posted at 21 precincts in the 69th District on 
Election Day because he suspects Democrats are committing voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans' suspicions were raised when they saw the recent surge in 
Democratic voter registration in the 69th District, which is now 21 points 
higher than for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we have 12 people in the field and we bring in 80 (registrations) and 
they bring in 1,000, you know something is funny," said Mark Thompson, 
Morrissey's campaign consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrat Mike Metzler, who plans to spend $450,000 to $500,000 in his 
effort to win the 69th District seat -- also with help from his party leaders 
in Sacramento -- predicts the 55.6% Democratic registration in the district 
will go up another point by Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Republican Party is running a little scared," Metzler said of 
Conroy's plan to have poll watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The local GOP leadership, meanwhile, says Conroy's plan to have volunteers 
watching for voter fraud on Election Day is his own, and not the party's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No party lines here. The 500-member Santa Ana Police Officers Assn. recently 
endorsed both Democrats and Republicans in key races: Umberg for attorney 
general; Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) for reelection to his 46th 
Congressional District seat; state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) for the 34th 
state Senate District; Anaheim Councilman Irv Pickler for the 68th Assembly 
District seat now held by Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove); Metzler for the open 
seat in the 69th Assembly District, and Conroy for reelection to his 71st 
Assembly District seat. 
</P>

<P>
 Quote of the week: "Knowing Mickey (Conroy), he'll probably spank them if they 
don't vote Republican." -- California Democratic Party Chairman Bill Press, on 
Conroy's pledge to watch for Election Day voter fraud and his attempt this year 
to pass legislation calling for the paddling of juvenile graffiti vandals.

CSUN PRESIDENT BACKS EOP CHANGES; EDUCATION: ANSWERING CRITICS, BLENDA J. 
WILSON SAYS THE PROGRAM FOR MINORITY STUDENTS WILL NOT BE DISMANTLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to quell ethnic unrest that erupted last week over the reorganization 
of a program for minority students, Cal State Northridge President Blenda J. 
Wilson said Saturday she has no intention of dismantling the program, as some 
faculty and students have charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Wilson said in an interview, controversial changes to the Educational 
Opportunity Program were intended to "assure that larger numbers of our 
minority and disadvantaged students receive a college degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer, the EOP was decentralized. Its director and staff were 
reassigned to a handful of other non-EOP offices that will continue to serve 
the same disadvantaged students. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization was part of broader changes made in student services, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also expanded Saturday on several points she made in a memo to faculty 
and staff members Friday addressing the recent unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the memo, Wilson cited problems with the program's previous structure as 
one reason that graduation rates among minority students at CSUN are 
"unacceptably low." 
</P>
<P>
 On average, just 36% of Latino students graduate within seven years and 28% 
graduate within six years, Wilson said. The figures are even lower for black 
students, 28% of whom graduate in seven years and 22% in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, graduation rates for non-minority students at CSUN are "in the 
40% to 50% range," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the university's total enrollment declined 7% this year as a result 
of the January earthquake and fee increases, EOP enrollment rose. A total of 
3,498 students now participate in the program, up from the 3,478 enrolled last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus administrators said revamping the program would make it more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 But students, faculty and staff members who staged last week's protest contend 
the changes are already harming minority students -- even though the school 
year has just begun and a new EOP director has yet to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, a crowd of black students marched in protest over the hiring of 
a white part-time instructor in CSUN's Pan-African studies department. The rest 
of the department's faculty is black. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters demanded that Wilson, who is also black, remove the white 
instructor, but she refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said she wasn't dismayed by the protest, calling it well-organized and 
quiet as protests go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever there is change, in lots of institutions, either in organization or 
personnel, I think it makes people both insecure and nervous about where the 
change will lead," she said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson added that plans to decentralize EOP began a year ago but were 
disrupted by January's earthquake, which devastated the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the plans not been interrupted by the earthquake, the changes made over 
the summer might not have caused this much controversy, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students came back to a partial reorganization of the EOP program instead of 
one where all the pieces are in place," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In view of the disquiet over the issue, however, Wilson said she plans to ask 
a faculty task force that was appointed to define the new role of the EOP 
director to step up its work. She added that she hopes to fill the post before 
the end of the semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had initially asked the task force to deliver its recommendations to 
her by March.

CAMPAIGN '94: ISSUES AND ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 69th 
Assembly District. They are Democrat Mike Metzler of Santa Ana, Libertarian 
George Reis of Santa Ana and Republican Jim Morrissey of Santa Ana. There is no 
incumbent. Here's how the candidates stand on four issues. "Three-Strikes" 
Crime Law 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler: "I strongly support the 'three-strikes' law. I support 'one-strike' 
legislation for violent child molesters and rapists. Additionally, I will fight 
to make sure that the half-cent increase for public safety approved by the 
voters does indeed go to maintain police and fire services instead of 
politicians' pet projects. I believe that an education and a good job are the 
best long-term solutions to crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Reis: "Although I certainly support the principle of holding violent criminals 
responsible for their crimes, I oppose the 'three-strikes' initiative. We must 
stop delegating responsibility for our society to the government. We need to 
establish new priorities for law enforcement, focusing on violent crimes and 
crimes against property. 'Three strikes' fails to establish these priorities. 
Instead of turning to the government, we should encourage honest citizens to 
protect themselves and their families with more liberal concealed weapons 
laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey: "I support the 'three strikes and you're out' initiative to put 
career criminals in prison for life, and I support a 'one strike and you're 
out' law to put child molesters and rapists in prison for life after their 
first offense. I'll work to implement California's death penalty and enact 
'trust in sentencing' laws to make sure criminals serve their entire prison 
sentences." "Save Our State" Measure to Curtail Benefits to Illegal Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler: "The promise of jobs is drawing immigrants to California. We must get 
tough with employers who knowingly hire workers who are not legal residents. We 
must develop tamper-proof Social Security cards and make the federal government 
enforce existing immigration and employment laws. Instead, Proposition 187 
targets children. It would kick 400,000 children out of school and deny them 
medical care. It would even deny orphans temporary food and shelter. What will 
400,000 kids do without an education, medical care, food or shelter?" 
</P>
<P>
 Reis: "The welfare state is eroding our prosperity, and I advocate broad-based 
reform of the welfare system. However, the SOS initiative misses the point, and 
I oppose the measure. Rather than blaming immigrants for the state's fiscal 
problems, let's look at where the real problems are. The politicians in 
Sacramento have run up multibillion-dollar deficits! The politicians have 
amassed the burden of a $52-billion budget! . . . The true problem lies with 
our welfare state and with the politicians who continue the unconscionable 
policy of tax, spend and borrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey: "With more than 100,000 illegal aliens coming to California every 
year, I will work to stop the invasion by securing our borders. I will also 
work to stop illegal aliens from collecting taxpayer-funded benefits, like 
welfare and public housing, services that cost taxpayers more than $3 billion a 
year. I support the 'Save Our State' proposal." Single-Payer Health Initiative 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler: "I strongly support universal health care, but we cannot adopt a plan 
which puts an unfair burden on small business and taxpayers in California. I 
believe that the state should wait to see if Congress adopts national health 
care reform before California adopts any major reform which potentially 
increases taxes or puts California businesses at a competitive disadvantage, 
jeopardizing jobs for California workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Reis: "Socializing the medical industry under a single-payer health plan is 
the worst thing we can do for health care reform. I support health care reform 
that leads us away from socialism. First, I support medical IRAs and full 
deductibility for health insurance and all health care expenses. Second, I 
encourage the use of more efficient health insurance plans that use higher 
deductibles. . . . Third, we must expand the supply of health care providers by 
expanding the roles of nurses and health care technicians and by authorizing a 
larger number of universities to offer medical degrees. Finally, doctors are 
engaging in wasteful, preemptive tests that place a higher priority on avoiding 
malpractice lawsuits than on the needs of patients; tort reform is essential to 
market-based health care reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey: "I am opposed to Proposition 186. Under this initiative, the state 
would take over one-seventh of California's economy. The estimated tax increase 
to pay for this single-payer health plan would be between $40 billion and $50 
billion per year. The proposition's open-ended benefits package and the lack of 
cost controls assure massive deficits from the start." Future Uses for El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler: "I would support the development of a commercial airport at El Toro 
if it can be shown to pay its own way and not be a burden on taxpayers, to be 
technically feasible and to be environmentally sound. A commercial airport 
would provide badly needed jobs for Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Reis: "I oppose the development of a public airport in El Toro for the 
following reasons: First, replacing one public facility with another is not my 
idea of progress. We have a rare opportunity to reduce the size of government 
in Orange County, and we should seize it! Second, consider how we make land use 
decisions. Do you want to politicize these decisions? . . . I can't imagine a 
less efficient decision-making process than putting land use issues on the 
ballot! The free market, on the other hand, is exceptionally efficient at 
maximizing the utility of land. Let the market decide! I advocate putting a for 
sale sign up at the Marine Base and selling the land to the highest bidder." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey: "El Toro Marine Corps Air Station is not in the 69th Assembly 
District. I believe the voters are fit to decide the issue in November."

<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles couple who say they were injured on Disneyland's "Pirates of the 
Caribbean" boat ride are suing the Walt Disney Co. for $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary and Donna Neubauer say they were injured at the park in June, 1993.They 
say their boat got stuck behind another at the bottom of a drop in the ride, 
then was rammed from behind, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit says the second boat "essentially climbed on the back of the 
plaintiffs' boat, creating a substantial impact and splintering the rear of the 
plaintiffs' boat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Neubauers allege that park employees knew about the problem, but allowed 
the boats to continue through the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 A Disneyland spokesman said the company would not be able to comment until 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Neubauer is seeking $1 million in compensatory damages, $100,000 for 
medical expenses and $500,000 for loss of wages. His wife is seeking $100,000 
in general damages, $100,000 for medical expenses and $200,000 in lost wages.

NO EVIDENCE TO BACK CLAIM OF VOTER FRAUD: REGISTRAR; POLITICS: REPORT DISPUTES 
REPUBLICAN CHARGES OF ILLEGAL REGISTRATION IN CENTRAL ORANGE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The registrar of voters office found no evidence of voter fraud after 
reviewing charges by local Republican legislators that Democrats in central 
Orange County may have registered voters illegally, according to a report 
released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the investigation, which did not differ from a preliminary 
finding released earlier in the week by Donald Tanney, the registrar of voters, 
showed that of 38 possible duplicate voter registrations, only 10 will require 
a "follow-up contact" by the registrar's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found no evidence . . . which would indicate an attempt to vote more than 
once in any election," Tanney stated in a letter to Assemblyman Mickey Conroy 
(R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Conroy and 10 other GOP legislators submitted a list of 38 
possible duplicate voter registrations in which the names varied slightly but 
the birth dates and residential addresses were identical. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans also questioned the validity of 171 registered voters who 
listed Santa Ana homeless shelters as their residences, and Tanney said only 
nine of those voters had any voting history. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanney did not agree to Conroy's request that he purge from voter rolls all of 
those who are illegally registered in the 69th Assembly District -- the area 
where Republicans suspect Democrats of engaging in voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said his office was attempting to modify its computer program so 
it could detect voter registrations with identical addresses. Possible 
duplications are now caught by checking full names, birth dates and birth 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy said that while he had not received a commitment to have the rolls 
purged before the end of the month, he hoped the county would "do its level 
best to have it done" before the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus on voter fraud, and Conroy's suggestion that volunteer poll watchers 
be assigned to the 69th District on Election Day, alarmed Democrats because the 
area is predominantly Democratic and Latino. Last week, Latino political 
activists asked the U.S. Justice Department to officially monitor voting on 
Election Day to ensure that Latino voters would not be intimidated.

SERVICE GROUP CHECKS INTO NOTORIOUS MOTEL; ACTIVISM: CLEAN-UP STARTS ON 
DILAPIDATED CHATEAU MOTEL, ONCE A MAGNET FOR CRIME. PLANS CALL FOR CONVERSION 
INTO A JOB-TRAINING CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of neighbors turned out Saturday in support of a plan to convert a 
motel that was once a magnet for drugs and crime into a job-training center. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was Lucia Yorey, who walked past the stunted brown vegetation in 
front of the Chateau Motel, 6719 Sepulveda Blvd., and burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been here since she was killed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorey's 18-year-old cousin, Roberta Mosentheim, was stabbed to death in Room 
14 on Feb. 12, 1990. On Saturday, Yorey vowed to recruit volunteers to help a 
nonprofit community-service group renovate the property and erase its lawless 
legacy.  
</P>
<P>
 The group, Asian Pacific Community Services, Westminster, has taken over the 
lease of the 46-unit motel -- where drug dealing, prostitution and even murders 
once occurred -- and will convert it into a training center for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the motel's rooms are still boarded up. Paint and plaster are peeling 
and gaping crawl holes have been punched through walls by vagrants who lived in 
the rooms after the motel was closed in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The motel's renovation will serve as on-the-job training for people "who need 
job skills like carpentry, housecleaning, clerical and computers," said Alan 
Woo, executive director of Asian Pacific Community Services. The group is 
seeking funding for the renovation, which is estimated to cost about $50,000 
and take two to three months to complete.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys residents Saturday looked around the motel grounds and examined some 
of the battered furniture, which was for sale. None of the items -- purple, 
orange and burgundy chairs and large mirrors -- had sold by noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to persuade the city to do something about the motel were frustrated 
because its ownership had been transferred frequently among unreachable 
landlords, said Judith Hirschberg, an aide to Councilman Marvin Braude.  
</P>
<P>
 But Woo said he was able to contact the latest owners, identified in city 
records as Jin Chan Yang and Guey Dan Hwu, and convince them that he could turn 
the motel -- where rooms once rented for $13 per hour -- into a respectable 
establishment.  
</P>
<P>
 Standing behind bulletproof glass in the motel office, where night clerk Feng 
Chen was stabbed to death by a resident of the motel in 1988, Mary Lou Holte, 
founder of the local Townkeeper's Action Group, said she was pleased by the 
day's turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once, the community was really angry about this place. They wanted it 
bulldozed," Holte said. "But I think when the new group starts, the bad 
memories will go." Woo said he hopes his group's work will be acknowledged by 
those who blame Southern California's immigrant population for the region's 
economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Asian and Pacific communities have been targeted as the problem," Woo 
said. "Here, we're part of the solution."

DISMAYED L.A. POLICE, DEPUTIES HEAD FOR GREENER PASTURES; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SIMI 
VALLEY AND OTHER VENTURA COUNTY DEPARTMENTS ARE LURING MORE OFFICERS WHO ARE 
SEARCHING FOR A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fed up with being overworked, understaffed and second-guessed, some Los 
Angeles-area police officers are defecting to new jobs on the safer streets of 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past month, the Simi Valley Police Department has hired three Los 
Angeles Police Department officers and a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the 16 Simi Valley officers who list LAPD or Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department on their resumes were hired in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 And more would-be defectors call Simi Valley every month, squeezed by bad 
morale in their own departments and lured by a better quality of life in 
Ventura County and a better workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're calling us all the time," said Simi Valley Capt. Jerry Boyce. "It's 
good for us, but it's bad for L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Los Angeles agencies acknowledge their officers are defecting to other 
departments in the belief that morale and working conditions will be better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been losing about eight to 10 officers every month pre-retirement," 
said LAPD personnel Cmdr. Dan Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes an estimated 100 officers resigning per year, 50 to 75 of whom 
defect to other departments, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Better equipment, pay and working conditions are drawing most of them away, 
Watson said, besides "the fact that we are understaffed and they have to work 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Sheriff's Department is losing deputies at a similar rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In fiscal year 1991-92, 24 deputies left for jobs with other police agencies. 
The number rose to 34 in 1992-93, then more than doubled the following year to 
75, said Fred Ramirez, the department's director of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies leave citing similar complaints, said 
Martha Zavala, that agency's assistant personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she hears the complaints secondhand, adding, "Most of the records 
we receive say they want to work closer to where they live, or they cite the 
fact they intend to move out to one of those areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for choosing Simi Valley are obvious: 
</P>
<P>
 * Simi Valley has ranked in FBI statistics as one of the five safest cities in 
the U.S. over 100,000 population for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residents there show an uncommon devotion to their police force. Small 
wonder. The 1990 U.S. census showed Simi Valley residents include the 
third-highest concentration of law enforcement officers in California for a 
city of its size, second only to Santa Clarita and Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 * Simi Valley officers work a four-day workweek of 10-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
 * And they earn -- after benefits are figured in -- about the same take-home 
pay as is offered by LAPD and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have better working conditions, the support of the public and the 
opportunity to do police work without having to run from call to call and not 
being able to help people," Boyce said. "They also like the reputation we 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides which, say former Los Angeles officers and deputies now working in 
Simi Valley, life in their old departments was growing increasingly difficult 
-- particularly after four LAPD officers beat Rodney King in 1991 and Los 
Angeles erupted in riots the year after they were acquitted in a Simi Valley 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 From rookie deputies to veteran patrol commanders, their gripes are the same, 
said Simi Valley Detective Randy Foushee, who runs background checks on the 
would-be defectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first and foremost thing they have in common is the fact that they feel 
unappreciated by upper management," Foushee said. "And the other thing they 
have in common is they don't feel they have a future." 
</P>
<P>
 Calls from L.A. applicants have increased in the 2 1/2 years since the riots, 
Foushee said, adding, "The tide is getting stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the King beating, veteran Van Nuys patrol Sgt. John Rygh retired 
after 25 years and 25 minutes with the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later he got a detective's job in Simi Valley, where he has lived since 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before he left the LAPD, said Rygh, 50, things were unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a decline in morale and some issues that concerned me," he said. "To be 
as blunt as I can, I think there was what I perceived as a lack of focus over 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Strict discipline procedures required that all citizen complaints of police 
misconduct be logged into an officer's record unless they were clearly 
disproved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This left some officers' otherwise clean records permanently stained with 
unproven lies, he said. And now LAPD officers must hit the streets fearing that 
any action they take could be criticized, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every week, former colleagues call to talk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere is even worse since the riots, they tell him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, 'There's no presumption of guilt (here) on the part of an officer,' 
and that blows them away," Rygh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'Morale is in the toilet,' and 'We're not very happy,' " he said. 
"They say their bosses are being evaluated on how strict they are as 
disciplinarians -- and they're coming down on everyone really hard." 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Cmdr. Watson replied, "No way is the No. 1 reason they leave because they 
feel there's a lack of support by the department or the community, but that 
does come up with some people." 
</P>
<P>
 More often, he said, departing officers say that living outside Los Angeles is 
cheaper and better for raising families. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said he dislikes that many of those leaving do so after about five 
years, taking their LAPD training with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes perfect sense for Simi Valley to hire them," he said. "It's not good 
for the city of Los Angeles and the LAPD because we have to go out and replace 
them with new ones." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, similar pressures are building, said 
Simi Valley Patrolman Mike Cratch, a former deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "After this LAPD affair and the riots, you're second-guessed all the time -- 
by the public, by the superiors," said Cratch, 23, a two-year Simi veteran who 
quit his Los Angeles County job after 18 months at the Pitchess Honor Rancho. 
"One minute you're the good guy and do your job, and the next minute you're the 
bad guy because somebody cries race, and that's real frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Cratch said he also left because jail duty -- expected of all rookie deputies 
-- was unpleasant work that threatened to stretch on for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sick all the time. You're dealing with nothing but slime. There's not 
one thing positive about that job," he said. "Five years in the jail to go work 
in South-Central Los Angeles? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley was a good choice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to work somewhere where you have some little kids wave at you like 
you're the ice cream man," Cratch said. "In L.A., you don't drive down the 
street and have people waving at you. It's just miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 Zavala, the assistant personnel director for the Los Angeles Sheriff's 
Department, said she has heard secondhand that deputies complain about being 
second-guessed. 
</P>
<P>
 But many rookies also leave because of the long stretch they must serve in the 
jails, she said, adding, "They feel they haven't had an opportunity to move and 
get into a patrol setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley is not the only home for Los Angeles police refugees, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also are calling the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and the Oxnard 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the 38 job inquiries received by the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department this year have been from southeast of the county line -- 12 from 
LAPD officers and nine from Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, said Ventura 
County personnel Sgt. Stephen De Cesari. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, 29 of the 51 inquiries came from Los Angeles officers, and the year 
before, 20 of the 43 inquiries came from Los Angeles, De Cesari said. In 1991, 
only 16 of the 39 inquiries came from there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether the King thing happened or not, you're talking about a smaller area 
and better living conditions in Ventura County," said Ventura County personnel 
Sgt. Michael Noguera. "The crime rate is lower here; we've got less than a 
million population." 
</P>
<P>
 But most Los Angeles applicants do not follow through because the Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department cannot quite match their current pay -- and because 
all new Ventura County deputies spend their first three years working in the 
Ventura County Jail, Noguera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officers are also tapping on Oxnard's doors in slightly greater 
numbers than before, said Oxnard Assistant Chief Stan Meyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two and a half years ago, the Oxnard Police Department opened its doors to 
"laterals" -- outside officers seeking to switch departments but keep their 
ranks, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first entry program we had, we got about 40 applications, and probably 
25% were from the Los Angeles area," Meyers said. Since then, the department 
has hired one Los Angeles sheriff's deputy and two LAPD officers -- one of whom 
left after failing probation, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Another factor that pushed some LAPD officers to begin shopping around was a 
change in that department's pension policy that allows them to leave with 
partial pensions before retirement age, said Simi Valley's Capt. Jerry Boyce. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference in jobs, Rygh said, is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, in L.A., we're going to see crime escalating," he said. "And out 
here, because we can walk up to people and chat with them, we still have the 
luxury of having some trust from the public. And that is a luxury, as is the 
fact that most people out here tend to like us -- and we can like them in 
return."

BOY, 16, SHOT IN NECK FROM OTHER CAR IN DRAG RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A seemingly chance encounter between two cars full of teen-agers turned 
violent Friday night when one driver opened fire on the other, leaving a 
16-year-old passenger in the hospital with a bullet in his neck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Ray Peterson said the drivers appeared to be challenging each 
other to a race down Orange Avenue near Holder Street just before 8 p.m. when 
the driver of a white, late-model Honda fired at least five shots at the 
passenger side of the other car. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, described as Asian, about 18 years old, with a shaved head and 
glasses, fled. The driver of the other car took the injured boy to a nearby 
hospital, Peterson said. It was not clear if the two youths knew each other nor 
if they were gang members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Witnesses said one guy wanted to race the other, which seems like a pretty 
slim reason to be blasting one another," Peterson said. "They were only side by 
side for less than a half a mile." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said the police have an idea where the shooting suspect lives, but he 
hadn't returned to the area by Saturday. The 16-year-old, shot in the neck and 
shoulder, is in serious, but stable, condition, said Peterson, who declined to 
identify the hospital for the boy's protection.

BOY, 14, FALLS TO HIS DEATH ON HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-year-old Lancaster boy tumbled 50 feet to his death Saturday after he 
lost his footing on a hillside near the California Aqueduct, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, his 14-year-old cousin and his 16-year-old brother were hiking 
near 180th Street West and Lancaster Road just before 3 p.m. when the boy fell 
down a cliff, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Daniel Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies are investigating the incident, Castillo said.

SPEED, TECHNIQUE SACK STATE TITLE FOR VILLA PARK BAGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In less than a minute Saturday, it was decided: the best bagger in business 
was James Bayly. 
</P>
<P>
 With quick hands and an eye on the squishable items, the 18-year-old grocery 
bagger from Ralphs in Villa Park beat out nine finalists to win the California 
State Grocers Assn.'s Bag-Off Contest at the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I had the lowest time and the best bags," said Bayly, who was judged 
on both the speed and quality of his bagging of such items as cereal, potato 
chips, sugar and salad dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayly, a Cal State Fullerton student from Orange, made the final round Friday 
by bagging 44 items in one minute and 21 seconds. Saturday he chopped nearly 
half a minute off that time to beat out 17 other state finalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayly said he thought he had lost it when he realized that the judges had 
mixed up the groceries to be packed from how he understood they would be 
arranged. But he quickly recovered, spurred on by an estimated 40 to 50 of his 
fellow employees from Ralphs who crowded around the stage yelling "Faster, 
faster! Use two hands!" 
</P>
<P>
 Bayly's winning form earned him a $1,000 scholarship and a trip to the 
nationals in Las Vegas in February. He intends to bank the money or spend it on 
college.

PASSION + BASEBALL = KEN BURNS; TELEVISION: THE EPIC 18 1/2-HOUR STUDY OF THE 
SPORT, HAS ITS DEBUT TONIGHT ON PBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAL BOCK, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is passion in filmmaker Ken Burns' voice when he talks about baseball. 
It is intense, almost as intense as his anger over the strike that shut down 
the sport this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these guys have forgotten that they are the custodians of more than 
the bottom line," Burns said. "They just don't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball," Burns' epic 18 1/2-hour study of the sport, debuts tonight on PBS, 
which showcased his monumental film of the Civil War two years ago. For him, 
the order of projects was logical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew for the 5 1/2 years I was making 'The Civil War' that this was the 
sequel," Burns said. "If you wish to know the country the Civil War made us, 
study baseball. If the Civil War was the American Iliad, I think baseball is 
the American Odyssey." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns' affection for the game began in his childhood. Born in the New York 
City borough of Brooklyn, he grew up in Newark, Del., and Ann Arbor, Mich., 
loving baseball and rooting first for the Dodgers, then for the Orioles and 
finally the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great time of my childhood, the one refuge I had," he said. "My 
mother was sick with cancer much of the time and died when I was 11. It was a 
hard childhood for me, except for baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, like so many fans, Burns abruptly dismissed the game. "It was not 
relevant for me for a time," he said. "There were other things going on -- 
Vietnam, civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1975, Burns found himself in New England and rediscovered baseball, just in 
time for the great Boston-Cincinnati World Series. "The fact that I left 
baseball was outrageous," he said. "When I came back to it, it was like I 
lifted my head out of the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 The film project represented a daunting task. "The Civil War was the story of 
four years that had a start a middle and an end," he said. "Baseball is 200 
years, the story of America with powerful characters, a story that takes in 
race, the labor struggle, immigration, the rise and decay of great cities. It 
is a story that still isn't finished." 
</P>
<P>
 The ratio of footage shot to footage used for this project was 30-to-1. "It 
runs 18 1/2 hours and we had to cut a lot to get there," Burns said. "The Civil 
War was 11 1/2 hours. I could do 11 1/2 hours just on the Brooklyn Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of the film is nostalgic, Burns is not a sentimental sort. "We 
have the mistaken idea that history is just a political-civic narrative," he 
said. "History is normally dry dates, facts and events. Emotion is what makes 
it stick in the mind and heart. This film stirs powerful emotions. I am an 
emotional archeologist." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns has this little test that he uses to compare the relevance and impact of 
baseball against other sports. "Tell me," he said, "how many points did Wilt 
Chamberlain score? How many yards did Walter Payton gain? 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't know those numbers. But they know 56 and .406 and 61 and 714 and 
755. Those numbers mean something over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is unique in a number of ways. There is no clock. You play against 
yourself and your own excellence. The defense has the ball. No other sport does 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a sport with rigid rules played on fields with different dimensions. It 
is the only game you can win or lose on a play in foul territory. It begins in 
spring and ends in fall, just like life." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the matter of success at the task. In basketball or football, 
you can find a successful play and run it over and over and over again. How 
often did the ball go to Michael Jordan when he played for the Bulls? How 
frequently did San Francisco use passes from Joe Montana to Jerry Rice? 
</P>
<P>
 "In baseball, Babe Ruth came up only once every nine times," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest baseball players fail seven in 10 times and they're still in 
Cooperstown. Things like that make baseball unique."

COMMENTARY / MIKE LUPICA; AGASSI WIN LEAVES BROOKE UNBEATEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand was not going around with Andre Agassi when he won Wimbledon, 
which means Brooke Shields has one more major tennis title than Streisand right 
off the bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand was at Wimbledon when Agassi was the defending champ in 1993. If you 
looked up at the Friends Box, there was Streisand in some kind of sailor suit 
jumping up and down for Agassi. It didn't help, and he finally lost in the 
quarterfinals to Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooke Shields, who has the same initials as Streisand, which may or may not 
figure here, doesn't just sit there in a sailor suit, she helps her guy walk 
away with the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Streisand -- who also showed up at an Open that Agassi lost, and so is 0-2 
in Grand Slam events -- is long gone from Agassi's life. Brooke Shields has 
taken her place in the Friends Box. And that is why you can't even think about 
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario as the women's champion at the '94 Open. The woman who 
really won the Open is Brooke Shields. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi was the big winner in New York, of course, just because of the way he 
played the game and won the crowd and stole the show, moving himself right into 
the role of No. 1 contender to Sampras. If this is the way he is going to play 
the game the rest of the way, if he is finally going to put tennis first and it 
really is important to him to be remembered as a champion, then that can only 
be good for tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 After he won Wimbledon in 1992, he immediately got lazy. He also got fat, in 
the head and in the belly, and seemed to be squandering a wonderful talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Agassi and Brad Gilbert, his new coach, say that has changed, and that 
Agassi will even play the Australian Open, the first major of the tennis year, 
for the first time. So there is a chance, if Agassi is looking for more than 
one major every three or four years, that the best part of his career could be 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 But you have to say Brooke did pretty well the last couple of weeks. Don't get 
me wrong: She seems pleasant enough. A month ago, she and Agassi came up to New 
Haven and played softball with Doc Rivers' team against Tom Brokaw's team to 
benefit Connecticut Special Olympics, and she was terrific all day, especially 
with the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out she could swing the bat, even if she does need a little work 
around second base. There was one hot smash to second. She fielded it cleanly 
and came up throwing. The problem was, she came up throwing to Agassi, who was 
pitching for Rivers' team, and happened to be standing on the mound at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi shrugged. "She always throws it to me," he said. "You think I'm going 
to complain?" 
</P>
<P>
 They seem to be quite an item. There they were kissing on some front pages 
after Agassi won the Open, and if Agassi is very much in play all of a sudden, 
you have to say Brooke Shields is, too. Sometime soon, she will be joining the 
cast of "Grease" on Broadway, as Rizzo. It is the best part she has had for a 
while. In the stands at the Open final last Sunday, while Brooke's guy Andre 
was hitting Michael Stich all over Louis Armstrong Stadium the way Joe Louis 
once hit Max Schmeling, I heard this conversation: 
</P>
<P>
 "What movies has she been in?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she was in something with DeNiro once, but I can't remember the 
title." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, the other one. About the island." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Blue Lagoon'!" 
</P>
<P>
 "That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wasn't that a while ago?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1980. It seems Brooke Shields could use the kind of big start to the 
second act of her career that her boyfriend got at this U.S. Open. Maybe she 
gets it with two shows, one after another: The tennis version of "Andre," in 
which the star is a tennis player from Vegas and not a seal from Maine, 
followed by "Grease." 
</P>
<P>
 There were times over the weekend when Brooke Shields, whose grandfather Frank 
was once an unseeded finalist in the U.S. championship, same as Agassi, seemed 
to get more air time on CBS than Agassi's opponents. In order of importance for 
CBS' broadcasts -- and I have absolutely no quarrel with this, by the way -- 
the stars seemed to be: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Brooke. 
</P>
<P>
 3) The real tall guy on the other side of the net from Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
 When Agassi finally beat Stich -- Sunday's tall guy -- and ran to give Brooke 
a kiss, there was a stampede of photographers that you were afraid might 
trample innocent lines-people. And when Agassi had finished in the interview 
room, the next person in there was Brooke Shields. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so strange," she said, "a press conference at the U.S. Open." 
</P>
<P>
 She said, "People have been coming up to me and congratulating me. I have 
nothing to do with the way he plays tennis. I find that a bit odd." 
</P>
<P>
 She said they had corresponded by letter for a while, and then things just 
developed after that. A couple of years ago, Agassi met Streisand over the 
telephone; he said he called her because he was so moved by her movie "The 
Prince of Tides" that he wanted to tell her himself, and they ended up talking 
for hours. One thing led to another and before you knew it, there was Streisand 
in the sailor suit at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 One night at the 1992 U.S. Open, Streisand, sitting in the stands watching 
Agassi play, was interviewed by Michael Barkann of the USA network. That was 
the night she told all of the country watching on cable that Agassi was a "Zen 
master" and "more evolved than his linear years." She said there was a purity 
about his game, and that he was "very in the moment." There was some other 
stuff from her about Agassi that I just summed up this way at the time: 
</P>
<P>
 Yum yum. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Streisand is out, Brooke Shields is in. She does not even begin rehearsals 
for "Grease" until next month. But when Barry Weissler, who produces the show 
along with his wife, Fran, saw the front pages of some of the New York tabloids 
last Monday, Weissler did say, "When does Andre play in New York again?" 
</P>
<P>
 Weissler was asked if he thinks it is true love between Agassi and Shields, or 
just some press agent's setup. "Oh, no," Weissler said, "they adore each other. 
And, I would like to point out to you, I adore them." 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Agassi may turn out to be more important in show business than a 
drugstore seat at Schwab's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm actually sitting here," Barry Weissler said, "wondering if Andre can 
sing."

NEBRASKA LEAVES UCLA SEEING RED -- IN THE MIRROR; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: CORNHUSKERS 
BREAK MODERN BRUIN RECORD WITH 484 RUSHING YARDS IN A 49-21 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nebraska is red cars, red shirts, go Big Red and red hot on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is red-faced after a 49-21 loss Saturday, and Tommie Frazier is a large 
part of the reason. Numbers had something to do with it, though most of them 
weren't his. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the comment before the game that I thought Tommie Frazier was in an 
elite class of athletes in college football," Bruin Coach Terry Donahue said of 
the Cornhusker quarterback. "After having played him this year on AstroTurf, I 
probably feel stronger about my belief than before the game. He's the type of 
player that makes your whole football team totally different. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a Michael Jordan-type player that just makes a difference in a game." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't so much that Frazier's numbers were impressive. He carried seven 
times for 29 yards, scoring one touchdown and two two-point conversions, and he 
completed only five of 11 passes for 59 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But he operated Nebraska's option so well that I-back Lawrence Phillips had 
178 yards in 19 carries, usually facing only one Bruin after Frazier had strung 
out the defense, then pitched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We established the running game and every running play was working," Frazier 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers finished with 484 rushing yards, most against UCLA in what the 
Bruin record book calls "the modern era," which isn't defined but seems to have 
something to do with the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't so much that he beat us with his athleticism," said UCLA safety 
Abdul McCullough, who spent much of the afternoon chasing Frazier. "It became a 
numbers game. He would get to the line of scrimmage and count players on each 
side of the center. Then he would call 'opposite,' and run the play to the 
fewest numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 It got personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw fear in their eyes," Frazier said. "A couple of their linebackers 
looked like, 'What are they going to run next? And is it going for a big gain?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, it did. And whether the look was fear or respect is open to 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of the players are all right," McCullough said. "I mean, Phillips 
isn't that fast. We've got backs as good as him, but that Frazier dude is the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 He was the difference early, when Nebraska took a 12-0 lead in the first 
quarter on Frazier's 23-yard touchdown pass to Eric Alford and Phillips' 
one-yard touchdown run. And he was the difference late, after the Bruins had 
closed to within 28-14 and Bjorn Merten missed a 42-yard field-goal attempt in 
the third quarter that would have made it interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier didn't carry on the next series, but he pitched to Phillips on a 
60-yard run that included missed tackles by everyone in the secondary. Probably 
tired, Phillips turned the I-back job over to Clinton Childs for the final 
eight yards and a 35-14 lead with 2:23 to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Childs got his name in the scoring summary, but he knew where the credit went. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommie audibled and ran the option, so they played him, and after I got the 
ball I knew I had one man to beat (Andy Colbert). I let him tackle me earlier 
in the game on a big-play opportunity, so I knew I had to get by him this time, 
and I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier's nine-yard touchdown pass to Brendan Holbein made the score 42-14, 
and after his 11-yard run on Nebraska's final scoring drive, Frazier called it 
a day, turning the offense over to Brook Berringer with 12:44 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins closed to within 49-21 on a Ryan Fien-led drive that covered 85 
yards and ended with an 11-yard scoring run by James Milliner with 8:07 to 
play. It was Fien's first playing time this season, and it began when UCLA 
quarterback Wayne Cook left the game after being hit on an incomplete pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had the wind knocked out of me," Cook said. "I could have come back 
in. It was a coach's decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook completed 15 of 28 passes for 217 yards and had a 20-yard touchdown pass 
to Kevin Jordan. It was the third time the two have hooked up on scoring passes 
this season, meaning all of Cook's touchdown passes have gone to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's four interceptions in the last two games have gone all over the place. 
Cook had only four all last season, including one in the Rose Bowl, but threw 
two last week against Southern Methodist that kept the Mustangs close and two 
more came Saturday in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The first came after Nebraska had taken a 20-7 lead on Frazier's 12-yard 
option run with 9:34 to play and his two-point conversion run. UCLA was 
driving, with Sharmon Shah picking up 19 yards and Cook completing passes to 
Jordan and Daron Washington to the Nebraska 49. Looking for Bryan Adams on a 
short pass, Cook instead found linebacker Clint Brown, who put the Cornhuskers 
in business at midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight plays later, they were in the end zone, Damon Benning diving over from 
two yards to end a drive that used the second-string backfield, except for 
Frazier, who punctuated it by running in for a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's second interception came when he overthrew Jordan, who apparently 
missed a pass route adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we go into the game knowing if we give the ball away more than we get 
it, it's just going to be too hard," Cook said. "We wanted to stay out there 
and give the defense a break . . . but we couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he got a chance to be a spectator, watching Frazier and the Nebraska 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their offense is awesome," Cook said. "If that team is going to get beat, it 
will be from defense." 
</P>
<P>
 That showed when 13th-ranked UCLA (2-1) moved the ball on Nebraska well 
enough, but mistakes kept the Bruins at bay. Mistakes also are one reason they 
were embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to get beaten if we played our best," tackle Jonathan Ogden 
said. "It's embarrassing to get beaten like this when we didn't play our best." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Cook: "We got our butts kicked. We're embarrassed we lost by so much." 
</P>
<P>
 "An embarrassment for us," McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe less so today, if Nebraska (3-0) regains the No. 1 spot in the 
Associated Press poll.

MORNING BRIEFING: NOT MUCH USE FOR STOCK OF 'OFFICIAL' BALLS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month, in anticipation of the World Series, Rawlings manufactured about 
5,000 baseballs. Each was stamped: "Official Ball. 1994 World Series." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, however, major league owners canceled the rest of the season 
because of the monthlong players' strike. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Rawlings has all those balls, now stored in a warehouse in Springfield, 
Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even know if major league baseball will allow us to sell them," 
Rawlings spokesman Scott Smith said. "But we imagine they will let us do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, for a piece of the action.

 Trivia time: What unusual NFL rule change was made in 1956? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sod story: Tom Waddle, Chicago Bear wide receiver, on the turf at Soldier 
Field: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were playing 18 holes on this surface, you would liken it to a 
municipal course. You know, lift, clean and place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Con man: Levon Kirkland, Pittsburgh Steeler linebacker, when asked if he was 
pro or con on the throwback uniforms the Steelers are wearing to commemorate 
the NFL's 75th anniversary: 
</P>
<P>
 "Con. Con, con, con, con. They wouldn't look as bad if it wasn't for those 
Grey Poupon pants we'll wear. Maybe the guys were tougher back then, but we're 
a bunch of soft guys. And we don't like them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clip and save: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle, writing on the 
49ers' signing of Deion Sanders:  
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be some concern from interested observers that Sanders' 
high-octane style will upset the delicate chemistry of the team. Absurd. What 
his style will do to the team's delicate chemistry is advance it into the NFC 
locker room for the Super Bowl next January." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous: George Kiseda, a former staff member of The Times, had this 
observation:  
</P>
<P>
 "Napoleon McCallum's season ended on grass. Dan Marino's (1993) season ended 
on grass. Bo Jackson's football career ended on grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "When are they going to get rid of that stuff?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Putdown: Glen Sather, general manager of the Edmonton Oilers, upon hearing 
that the Kings' Marty McSorley, a former Oiler, was accusing the owners of 
putting guns to the players' heads with moves to roll back benefits and talk of 
a lockout: "This from a guy who didn't have two nickels to rub together when he 
came to Edmonton. I didn't know he had a degree in economics." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sourpuss: Mark Kriegel of the New York Daily News: "Why does Donald Fehr 
always look like he just drank a quart of bad milk?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vicious: Bob Ryan, in the Boston Globe: "Would that the Arizona Cardinals go 
0-16 and Buddy (Absolutely No Relation) Ryan be exposed as the egocentric bully 
he really is." 
</P>

 Trivia answer: Loudspeaker coaching from the sidelines was discontinued.

<P>
 So what was so significant, besides the score, in Penn State's 61-21 wipeout 
of Iowa? 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Paterno's wonderful shades? Hayden Fry finally admitting he allows Craig 
T. Nelson to borrow his name to play Hayden Fox in "Coach"? 
</P>
<P>
 Nope. Something more trivial. It was the first-ever regular-season matchup 
between Division I coaches with 200 victories. And Paterno won it. He now has 
260 victories in 29 seasons and Fry has 202 in 33. BET MRS. FIELDS GOT IN 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Snub Award goes to Amos Lawrence, but that would mean some recognition 
for the former North Carolina running back and that would disqualify him. So 
let's just say that if there actually was a Big Snub Award, Lawrence's 
achievements would go unnoticed, automatically earning him the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, they retired the uniform numbers of 14 former Tar Heel football stars 
in ceremonies before North Carolina's 49-0 shutout of Tulane at Chapel Hill, 
but Lawrence's No. 20 was not among them. 
</P>
<P>
 This seemed a curious oversight to many, including Lawrence, an elementary 
school physical education teacher in Virginia. After all, he set 18 school 
records and is one of only two collegians (Tony Dorsett is the other) to rush 
for at least 1,000 yards each year at a school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all mind-boggling to me," The News & Observer of Raleigh quoted 
Lawrence, known as "Famous Amos." 
</P>
<P>
 Memo to "Famous Amos": That's the way the cookie crumbles. WHY NOTHING'S WRONG 
WITH THREE YARDS, CLOUD OF DUST 
</P>
<P>
 The best reason for sticking with the running game was presented by the LSU 
Tigers, who had three passes intercepted and run back for touchdowns in the 
fourth quarter and lost to Auburn, 30-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Auburn Coach Terry Bowden: "The second guessers and people in retrospect 
are going to have plenty of things to say." 
</P>
<P>
 The second-guessers will descend upon LSU Coach Curley Hallman, who said he 
probably should have called a few more running plays, especially since he had a 
23-9 lead in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hallman: "You go back in hindsight, would I do it differently? Yeah, 
probably on a lot of 'em. Maybe I'll learn from this. Yeah, in hindsight, I 
would go back and run it." NOW, A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOU BASEBALL FANS 
</P>
<P>
 Utah State beat Ohio University, 5-0, in Athens, Ohio, on a field goal and a 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Try as it might, Ohio University couldn't get to first base. AND THEY'LL DO IT 
FAST 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's 27-3 loss to Ohio State was a simple matter of physics. How else 
can you interpret Pittsburgh quarterback Sean Fitzgerald's explanation of a 
27-3 loss to Ohio State? 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fitzgerald: "Big fast guys will beat small fast guys." NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 -- Auburn has the nation's longest winning streak, 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coach Larry Smith's winning streak at Missouri reached one. The Tigers 
ended a 17-game, four-year road losing streak with a 17-0 victory at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tim Murphy of Harvard, who took over when Joe Restic retired after 23 
seasons, became the first Harvard coach to win his opening game since Art 
Valpey in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steve Stenstrom tied Jim Plunkett as Stanford's winningest quarterback as 
the Cardinal defeated San Jose State, 51-20. Stenstrom got his 22nd victory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- UNLV receiver Randy Gatewood set the NCAA I-A record for most catches and 
yards in a game. He had 23 receptions for 363 yards in a 48-38 loss to Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grambling defeated Morgan State by a mere 75 points, 87-12. DOUBLE YOUR 
PLEASURE 
</P>
<P>
 Grady Benton passed for 560 yards and a school-record eight touchdowns as West 
Texas A&M outscored Howard Payne, 59-56. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton, a transfer from Arizona State, completed 41 of 69 passes, including 
three touchdowns to Brian Bailey. Benton also threw two touchdown passes to 
Brian's twin brother, Brad Bailey. FOR THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY THEY SWEAR 
SOMEBODY WINS 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest big-school football rivalry west of the Allegheny Mountains is 
what? Take a guess. Uh, uh, you're wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Cincinnati vs. Miami of Ohio, two schools that have been knocking each 
other all over the football field for 99 years. Miami of Ohio leads the series, 
53-39-7, the latest tie occurring at Oxford, Ohio, on Miami's 37-yard field 
goal into a gusting wind as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Bacon kicked a school-record 58-yard field goal for the Bearcats. Final 
score: Cincinnati 17, Miami, Ohio, 17. WHERE THERE'S A WILL, I GUESS THERE'S A 
WAY 
</P>
<P>
 How did SMU Coach Tom Rossley explain a 34-31 victory over New Mexico? 
</P>
<P>
 "The players willed themselves to win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well, of course. If it was that simple, they ought to expand the scope of 
their powers. Maybe they should try willing themselves to ace trig class. THE 
STORY FOR CYCLONES: NOT WINDLESS, BUT WINLESS 
</P>
<P>
 Well, looking at that old clock on the wall, it might be about time that 
somebody asks Jim Walden to start packing his bags. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iowa State coach is 0-3 this season, 28-50-2 since he came to the campus 
in Ames, Iowa, in 1987 and has had one winning season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cyclones' latest defeat was to Western Michigan. This happened despite, 
according to an Associated Press report, a "tricky Cyclone Stadium wind." 
</P>
<P>
 It might be blowing one way now. Whatever woes Walden had, they're stacked 
even higher now. He lost his top two quarterbacks to injuries and finished the 
game with former walk-on defensive back Jeff St. Clair at the position. YOU 
CAN'T SHUCK ALCORN; AIR MCNAIR STILL FLYING 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the Steve McNair update: Alabama State held Alcorn State's star 
quarterback to less than 600 yards total offense for the first time this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 McNair earned 452 yards total offense, 344 yards with his passing, in Alcorn's 
39-7 victory at Lorman, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn State is a Division I-AA school. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT FROM A BUNCH OF 
TURTLES? 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Williams of Maryland rushed for 163 yards in a 24-13 victory over West 
Virginia and it was nearly 100 yards more than the Terrapins had managed in 
their two previous games. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland was averaging 33.5 yards rushing a game, but Williams came close to 
matching that average on one play -- a 25-yard touchdown run. IT'S A MATH 
PROBLEM: YOU KNOW, LONG DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 So you like playing with the Big Boys? Northeast Louisiana, a former I-AA 
power playing in Division I-A for the first time this season, got drubbed, 
70-6, by Georgia in Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians are 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Georgia's biggest victory since beating The Citadel, 76-0, in 1958 and 
the worst setback for the Indians since a 63-0 loss at Cincinnati in 1977. BUT 
IT'LL LOOK LIKE A LINE DRIVE IN THE BOX SCORE 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia overcame seven turnovers and nine penalties to defeat Clemson 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers were in well, bad company, all right. Oklahoma overcame 11 
turnovers and three lost fumbles to defeat Texas Tech, 17-11. SOMETIMES IT'S SO 
EASY (AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last year, Boston College and Virginia Tech combined for 1,126 yards as the 
Eagles won, 48-34. The same two teams managed 468 yards this time as the Hokies 
avenged last year's loss, 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nebraska last year gained only 208 yards rushing against UCLA but had 234 
yards on the ground by halftime this time. The Cornhuskers totaled 484 yards on 
the ground in their 49-21 victory over the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Notre Dame was held to 60 yards rushing in the first half of its 21-20 
victory over Michigan State. The Irish piled up 209 yards in the second half as 
they came from behind to win. THEY CAME, THEY SAW THEY DIDN'T LOSE 
</P>
<P>
 We hear enough about the heroes. Let's have a cheer for the doormats. Better 
make these former doormats, though. You probably won't have these guys to wipe 
your cleats on anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kent broke major-college football's longest losing streak, beating Akron, 
32-15, for its first victory in 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Northwestern beat Air Force, 14-10, to end a 10-game winless drought. 
</P>
<P>
 -- SMU broke a six-game home losing streak with its victory over New Mexico. 
DUCKS' HOME CROWD NOT WHAT IT'S QUACKED UP TO BE

 The 25,358 in Eugene who came to watch Oregon's 34-16 loss to Utah represented

FLORIDA GETS ITS POINT ACROSS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: GATORS' 31-0 VICTORY IS 
TENNESSEE'S WORST HOME LOSS IN 70 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there a mercy rule in the house? If so, please report immediately to all 
future Florida opponents. They'll need it. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1-ranked Gators were at it again Saturday evening, pillaging and 
plundering their way to a 31-0 victory against 15th-ranked Tennessee at Neyland 
Stadium, the Volunteers' worst home loss in 70 years. Many more of these routs 
and the NCAA might start checking Florida IDs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just another little win on the road," said Gator quarterback Terry Dean, who 
completed 18 of 26 passes for 303 yards and two touchdowns before retiring to 
the sideline midway through the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean smiled when he said it. He knew Florida hadn't beaten a top 25 team on 
the road since 1990, Coach Steve Spurrier's first season at Gainesville. He 
also knew that Gator haters couldn't wait to add an eighth defeat to the 
running total. 
</P>
<P>
 Could you blame them? Sure, Florida had opened its season with a 70-21 victory 
against New Mexico State and then followed it up with a 73-7 victory against 
Kentucky. But this was Tennessee. At Neyland Stadium. In front of an orange sea 
of 96,656 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess who wasn't impressed? 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I came up here, everyone was telling me, 'You're going to see a lot of 
orange, you're going to hear a lot of noise,' " said Florida freshman tailback 
Fred Taylor, who scored the evening's first touchdown on a seven-yard run. "All 
I saw tonight was a lot of silver from all those empty seats. Yeah, I guess 
(Tennessee) had a chance. I guess they did . . . until the whistle blew." 
</P>
<P>
 Gator gloating was the postgame posture of choice -- and with good reason. 
Florida gained 439 total yards and was as balanced as a penny pincher's budget: 
31 rushes, 27 passes. Of the Gators' 58 plays, 16 went for 10 yards or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida used a two-tight end formation and gained 136 yards on the ground. 
Other times, it used five-receiver sets and caught Tennessee's players glancing 
toward the sideline, arms raised in a "what-do-we-do-now?" position. Mismatches 
followed, like the time 6-2, 232-pound linebacker Scott Galyon found himself 
trying to keep up with Gator wide receiver Ike Hilliard, who leaves contrails 
when he runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard gained 19 yards on the play as Galyon groped air. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more impressive was Florida's defense. Earlier in the week, Mike Archer, 
Kentucky's defensive coordinator, told anyone who would listen that the Gators 
might be stronger defensively than offensively. He wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida forced Tennessee (1-2) to use all three of its quarterbacks, beginning 
with starter Todd Helton, followed by freshman Peyton Manning, followed by 
freshman Branndon Stewart . . . then Manning again, then Stewart again. It 
didn't matter. The Gators recorded five sacks, dominating one of the best 
offensive lines in the nation, and shut out the Volunteers for the first time 
since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lessons in football, lessons for life," said Tennessee Coach 
Phillip Fulmer. "This was an opportunity to learn a lot of lessons." 
</P>
<P>
 Lesson No. 1: Florida is no fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators used everyone in uniform except one of the Florida tuba players. 
They go three deep at nearly every position. And no team has matched the Gators 
in speed, strength or quickness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told you on Tuesday that I felt they are the best football team in the 
country," Fulmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but not everyone believed him. In a strange way Florida's 70-point 
scores prompted questions instead of answering them. The one heard the most: 
Florida -- fact or fiction? 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we can't be stopped," said Florida wide receiver Jack Jackson. 
"We hope we silenced some of the critics." 
</P>
<P>
 Muzzles were distributed to everyone, including the Volunteers, who were down, 
7-0, midway through the first quarter and 24-0 by the end of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like after the first couple of drives they were a lot, uh, softer," 
said Florida center David Swain, who received the game ball from Spurrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Swain suggested Tennessee gave up shortly after Florida went ahead. 
The Volunteers were confused, intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed to be running around a lot right before we snapped the ball," he 
said. "But that's because if the run works and the pass works, you can do 
anything on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Lesson No. 2: Florida can do anything it wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got so bad for Tennessee that with Florida ahead by those 31 points and 
Tennessee facing a fourth-down situation with 3:24 left in the game, Fulmer 
ordered his field-goal unit onto the field amid boos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get something on the board and salvage what pride we had," 
Fulmer said, but John Becksvoort's 38-yard attempt sailed wide left. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people said the Gators couldn't win on the road," said Florida 
defensive end Kevin Carter, who had seven tackles, two of them sacks. "Well, we 
dispelled that myth tonight."

LSU'S UPSET BID IS INTERCEPTED; SEC: AUBURN RETURNS THREE ERRANT PASSES FOR 
TOUCHDOWNS IN LAST 13 MINUTES OF 30-26 VICTORY.

<P>
 They were all there, but no one could believe what they had just seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it in my life," Auburn Coach Terry Bowden kept 
repeating. 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn, given up for dead early in the fourth quarter, scored three touchdowns 
on interception returns in the final 13 minutes Saturday, the last by Brian 
Robinson with 1:55 to play, and stunned Louisiana State, 30-26. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory extended 11th-ranked Auburn's winning streak to 14 games, longest 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 None have been more improbable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been in a game like that," Bowden said. "I've never seen one." 
</P>
<P>
 LSU was shellshocked after watching Auburn's defense score four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the most disappointed I've ever been in my coaching career is right 
now," said LSU Coach Curley Hallman. "The players are hurting bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn gained only 16 yards and managed only one first down in the second 
half, and that was wiped out by a fumble two plays later. Bowden was forced to 
remove his starting quarterback in a vain attempt to generate some offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't get a first down. We couldn't get a thing going," Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Andre Lafleur kicked a 39-yard field goal in the opening minute of the 
fourth quarter to give LSU a 23-9 lead, the winning streak appeared to be over. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, inexplicably, LSU kept throwing the ball when it appeared all that was 
needed was to run out the clock. On third and eight, Jamie Howard's pass down 
the middle was picked off by strong safety Ken Alvis, who raced 42 yards to 
close the gap to 23-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed something to give the team a spark," Alvis said. "We were the ones 
today that were able to step up and make a big play when we needed it." 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than a minute later, Fred Smith stepped in front of another pass 
by Howard and brought the ball 32 yards down the left sidelines, diving the 
last three yards to tie the score 23-23. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard directed a 13-play, 70-yard drive to set up Lafleur's third field goal, 
a 22-yarder with 5:26 to play that put LSU ahead, 26-23. Auburn failed to move 
the ball and was forced to punt with less than four minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the play that Howard will remember for a lifetime. On third and four 
at the Auburn 32, with 2:06 left and Auburn out of timeouts, the junior 
attempted to hit Brett Bech on a slant route across the middle. The ball popped 
in the air and Robinson picked it off at the 41 and raced untouched down the 
sideline.

DESPITE OFF DAY, POWLUS RALLIES IRISH; NONCONFERENCE: AFTER TRAILING AT 
HALFTIME, 20-7, NOTRE DAME COMES BACK TO BEAT MICHIGAN STATE, 21-20. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Powlus, who had four passes intercepted, directed two long second-half 
drives Saturday to bring No. 8 Notre Dame back from a 20-7 halftime deficit to 
a 21-20 victory over Michigan State at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made some wrong reads, some stupid plays I shouldn't have done," Powlus 
said. "I tried to force a couple things. I should have taken what they gave me. 
But it turned out OK." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 16th consecutive road victory for Notre Dame (2-1), breaking the 
school record of 15 set in 1929-31. Knute Rockne's 1929 team played and won all 
nine of its games on the road while Notre Dame Stadium was being built. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus, a redshirt freshman, completed only 10 of 30 passes for 161 yards. But 
he was on target when he had to be in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 His 13-yard pass to Mike Miller on third and nine kept a drive alive early in 
the third quarter. Two plays later, Lee Becton broke at least four tackles on a 
37-yard touchdown run that made the score 20-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't bury my head," Powlus said. "I couldn't say, 'Well, I'm doing 
terrible, it's over.' I had to keep playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the third quarter, the Irish launched an 84-yard, 10-play drive for 
the go-ahead touchdown. Powlus completed all three of his passes for 66 yards 
in the march, including a 15-yard touchdown pass to Robert Farmer with 12:12 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State (0-2) came up with two more interceptions after that, but the 
Irish countered by sacking Spartan quarterback Tony Banks three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks, a transfer from Mesa Junior College in San Diego who was making his 
second start, completed 15 of 27 passes for 190 yards without an interception. 
Banks, a cousin of former USC and NFL linebacker Chip Banks, signed with the 
Minnesota Twins out of San Diego's Hoover High, but a rotator cuff injury cut 
his baseball career short. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks failed to put much of a dent in the Irish defense in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State finished with 270 yards, but got only 21 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame had only 114 yards at halftime, but finished with 430. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans suffered a similar fate last week when they led at Kansas, 10-0, 
before losing, 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to sit here and give them too much praise," Banks said. "We 
moved the ball against them. We feel we should have won it. We feel we can win 
every game. People haven't seen that yet, but they will. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we put four quarters together, and when Tony Banks puts four quarters 
together, then everybody will be pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 For Michigan State, Mill Coleman scored on a 30-yard run, Banks on a 
three-yard run, and Chris Gardner kicked field goals of 31 and 24 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 For Notre Dame, Randy Kinder, who went to East Lansing High, carried 18 times 
for 104 yards, and Derrick Mayes caught a 29-yard touchdown pass from Powlus in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 100th game with Lou Holtz as coach for Notre Dame. He has a 79-20-1 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought at the half we could win, but I was not very convincing to the 
players," Holtz said. "It was a nightmare of a first half." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish, who lost three fumbles in a 26-24 loss to Michigan last week, 
turned the ball over three times in the first half against Michigan State. The 
Spartans converted all three misplays into scores.

EAST ROUNDUP; NO. 18 VIRGINIA TECH DEFEATS BOSTON COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virginia Tech is off to its best start since 1981 because of its defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18th-ranked Hokies (3-0) defeated Boston College, 12-7, Saturday at Boston 
by limiting the Eagles to 244 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College (0-2) was shut out until Jeff Ryan threw a 12-yard touchdown 
pass to Pete Mitchell with six minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensively, Virginia Tech managed only 233 yards and no touchdowns. The 
Hokies' only touchdown came on Torrian Gray's 66-yard return on one of his 
team's four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse 37, Rutgers 36 -- Kevin Mason threw two fourth-quarter touchdown 
passes in drives set up by Rutgers turnovers and Bryce Bevill stopped a 
two-point conversion try as the Orangeman outlasted the Scarlet Knights in a 
Big East game at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutgers (2-1, 1-1) nearly pulled it out when Ray Lucas hit Reggie Funderburk 
with a 40-yard touchdown pass with 39 seconds to play. Lucas hit Funderburk on 
the conversion try, but Bevill brought down the receiver at the one. 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse (2-1, 1-0), was outgained 540 yards to 259 but got two long kickoff 
returns from Jim Turner, one for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 East Carolina 31, Temple 14 -- Junior Smith ran for 165 yards and two 
touchdowns in 23 carries to lead the Pirates (1-1) over the mistake-prone Owls 
(1-1) at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. It was the 12th consecutive home 
loss for Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard 39, Columbia 32 -- Vin Ferrara, who earlier passed for two touchdowns, 
scored on a four-yard run with 21 seconds remaining as the Crimson won at New 
York in Tim Murphy's first game as coach. Columbia led, 32-31, with 4:55 left 
after a touchdown and a 35-yard PAT kick. The Lions were penalized after the 
touchdown for excessive celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 Yale 27, Brown 16 -- Senior linebacker Carl Ricci had three interceptions, 
returning one 29 yards for the go-ahead touchdown, as the Bears won an Ivy 
League game at Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn 27, Lafayette 7 -- Terrance Stokes ran for 143 yards and a touchdown and 
the Quakers (1-0) scored on their first four possessions at Philadelphia to 
extend their winning streak to 13 games. Penn, the defending Ivy League 
champion, held the Leopards (0-2) to 84 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Colgate 20, Dartmouth 16 -- Freshman Mark Lindell passed for two touchdowns as 
the Red Raiders (1-1) overcame a 16-0 deficit to beat the Big Green (0-1) at 
Hamilton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell 31, Princeton 16 -- Chad Levitt ran for two touchdowns as the Big Red 
scored an Ivy League victory at Ithaca, N.Y.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; PENN ST. HUMBLES ANOTHER FOE, 61-21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Penn State has been so thoroughly dominant that the Nittany Lions are starting 
to wonder what it is like for their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6-ranked Penn State, 3-0 overall and 2-0 in the Big Ten, jumped to a 45-0 
lead and cruised to a 61-21 victory over Iowa on Saturday at State College, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 The game followed the pattern of Penn State's first two victories -- 56-3 over 
Minnesota and 38-14 over USC. In each game, Penn State has led at least 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder what it's like to be on the other side of the field," tailback 
Ki-Jana Carter said. "I wonder what they are thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter scored two first-quarter touchdowns and backup tailback Mike Archie 
scored three times in the first 16 minutes as Penn State put away Iowa (2-1, 
0-1) early. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State took advantage of a blocked punt, an interception, a fumble and a 
porous Iowa defense to build a 42-0 lead, as Archie got his third score on a 
four-yard run 37 seconds into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State ran for 309 yards, passing only 13 times. Quarterback Kerry Collins 
completed five of seven passes for 98 yards and one touchdown in limited duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 40, San Diego State 17 -- Chris Darkins rushed for 155 yards and a 
touchdown in 25 carries to lead the Gophers at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Tim Schade, mostly a reserve after playing poorly in the Gophers' 
48-17 loss to San Diego State last season, passed for 213 yards in outplaying 
the Aztecs' Tim Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota (2-1) also got touchdowns from its defense and special teams, a 
school record-tying four field goals for the second consecutive game from Mike 
Chalberg and 10 receptions from Chuck Rios. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Darkins who especially gave the Aztecs (2-1) headaches -- which was 
appropriate since he suffered a concussion on what he called "a violent act" by 
San Diego State safety Darrell Lewis in the 1993 game. Lewis drove his helmet 
into Darkins well away from the play and the running back missed the rest of 
that game and all of the next with headaches and dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a senior," Darkins said at the time. "I have no way of getting back at 
him even when we play them next year." 
</P>
<P>
 No, but he did get back at Lewis' former team. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 59, Kentucky 29 -- Redshirt freshman Alex Smith ran for 221 yards and 
two touchdowns in 19 carriers as the Hoosiers amassed a school-record 650 yards 
at Lexington, Ky. Indiana (3-0) also had a school-record 564 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who had touchdown runs of 63 and nine yards, topped the 213 yards by 
Louisiana State's Harvey Williams in 1990 for the most rushing yards against a 
Kentucky team. He also broke the Big Ten freshman rushing mark of 207 yards set 
by Indiana's Anthony Thompson against Wisconsin in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky (1-2) trailed at halftime, 35-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern 14, Air Force 10 -- This nonconference game at Air Force Academy, 
Colo., was supposed to feature lots of offense, but it came down to a touchdown 
on a 96-yard return of a fumble recovery by Wildcat cornerback Chris Martin 
with 12:12 remaining and an interception by linebacker Geoff Shein that killed 
a scoring threat by the Falcons with about a minute remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern Coach Gary Barnett said another key was the punting of Paul 
Burton, who had three punts of more than 60 yards and a 57-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first victory for Northwestern (1-1-1) in 11 games, including a 
41-41 tie with Stanford the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force (0-3) held Wildcat running back Dennis Lundy to 60 yards in 18 
carries. He had 138 yards against Notre Dame and 130 against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State 27, Pittsburgh 3 -- The Buckeyes had five sacks, five other tackles 
for losses, caused a fumble, intercepted a pass, broke up four passes and 
blocked two kicks in manhandling the Panthers in a nonconference game at 
Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitt (1-2) was held to 139 yards passing and 103 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State quarterback Bob Hoying completed 14 of 21 passes for 217 yards and 
two touchdowns, a 12-yarder to Buster Tillman in the second quarter and a 
43-yard strike to Chris Sanders in the third. Hoying set up Tillman's touchdown 
with a 45-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie George rushed for 126 yards in 17 carries and also scored a touchdown 
for Ohio State (2-1), which had 512 yards but committed five turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitt was limited to 242 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois 34, Northern Illinois 10 -- Johnny Johnson, relegated to No. 2 
quarterback after a season-opening loss, passed for two touchdowns and the 
Illini (2-1) pulled away in the second half at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who completed 15 of 20 passes for 222 yards, relieved in the second 
quarter after starter Scott Weaver had two passes intercepted. Johnson 
immediately directed the Illini on a 69-yard drive, aided by a third-down pass 
interference call. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Illinois (0-3) trailed only 14-10 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue 49, Ball State 21 -- Mike Alstott rushed for 156 yards and four 
touchdowns in 19 carries and Carey Rogers ran for 124 in 13 to lead the 
Boilermakers at West Lafayette, Ind.

 Rashaan Salaam ran for four touchdowns and Colorado converted four first-half 
interceptions into 17 points, leading the No. 7-ranked Buffaloes to a 55-17 
rout of No. 10 Wisconsin Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kordell Stewart threw two touchdown passes and accounted for 301 yards as 
Colorado (2-0) posted its sixth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin (1-1) couldn't overcome the early giveaways or Colorado's big-play 
offense, trailing, 27-10, at halftime and, 48-17, after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam, who has seven touchdowns in two games, finished with 85 yards in 26 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The 55 points were the most Colorado has scored against a ranked opponent and 
the most allowed by Wisconsin since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffaloes scored on five of their first six possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Hudson's 29-yard punt return set up the first touchdown. Stewart ran 16 
yards, then passed 13 yards to Michael Westbrook, and Salaam's second-effort 
run from one yard out made it 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, safety Steve Rosga made the first interception off Darrell 
Bevell at the Colorado 43. Illegal motion and holding penalties stymied that 
drive, and Colorado settled for Neil Voskeritchian's 48-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Badgers responded with a career-best 51-yard field goal by John Hall 
moments later. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second quarter, safety Donnell Leomiti stepped in front of 
intended receiver Brent Moss, picked off Bevell's pass and returned it 43 yards 
to the Wisconsin seven. Salaam scored from the three to make it 17-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin's next possession also ended in an interception, as cornerback Chris 
Hudson got in front of J.C. Dawkins and returned the theft six yards to 
midfield to set up a 35-yard field goal by Voskeritchian. 
</P>
<P>
 Badger running back Brent Moss rushed for 118 yards, his 13th consecutive 
100-yard game.

SEC ROUNDUP; LONG SCORING PASS LIFTS ALABAMA OVER ARKANSAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jay Barker and Sherman Williams combined on a 73-yard touchdown pass play late 
in the third quarter and No. 12 Alabama stuffed Arkansas on six consecutive 
possessions Saturday in beating the Razorbacks, 13-6, at Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' touchdown made the score 10-6, and Alabama, 3-0 overall and 2-0 in 
the Southeastern Conference, was content to play safe, punt and wait on an 
Arkansas mistake. It came early in the fourth quarter when Matt Wait, who had a 
punt blocked in the third quarter, punted only 12 yards into the wind. Alabama 
took over at the Arkansas 23, ran three plays and Michael Proctor kicked a 
34-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a 6-3 lead on Lance Ellison's second field goal, Arkansas started 
from its 28, 10, eight, 20, four and 48 and made only one first down. Willie 
Gaston ended the last two possessions with interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas (1-2, 0-2) made 158 yards and nine first downs in the first half; 109 
yards and three first downs in the second, including one on a 66-yard run by 
Oscar Malone. That run led to Lance Ellison's second field goal, a 31-yarder 
that gave the Razorbacks a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama faced third and 10 at its 27 when Barker sidestepped a defender and 
drifted toward the line of scrimmage. His pass cleared a receiver and a couple 
of defenders and was caught by Williams near the Alabama 45. He cut inside Mike 
Nunnerley and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also carried 33 times for 142 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia 70, Northeast Louisiana 6 -- Greg Bright and Carlos Yancy returned 
interceptions for touchdowns in the first quarter and Eric Zeier passed for 
three touchdowns at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Bright's 36-yard return broke a scoreless tie with 11:19 to play in the 
opening quarter and Yancy came back 2:10 later to score on an 81-yard return 
after the Indians had reached the Bulldog 30. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third loss in a row for the Indians, a former Division I-AA 
national power moving into I-A this season. Georgia is 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Georgia's most lopsided victory since 1958, when it defeated The 
Citadel, 76-0, and the worst loss for Northeast Louisiana since 1977, when it 
was defeated by Cincinnati, 63-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Bowie scored touchdowns on runs of five, one and two yards and freshman 
Hines Ward, a quarterback making his first start at tailback, ran for 117 yards 
and a touchdown in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi 20, Vanderbilt 14 -- Josh Nelson passed for 230 yards and two 
touchdowns to lead the Bulldogs at Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt (1-2, 0-2) controlled the third quarter with two drives of 80 
yards. Ronnie Gordon capped the first with a three-yard touchdown run, and 
Jermaine Johnson's one-yard dive gave the Commodores a 14-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nelson sparked Mississippi (2-1, 1-1), ending a 78-yard drive with a 
26-yard touchdown pass to Roell Preston that put the Bulldogs in front, 17-14. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina 31, Louisiana Tech 6 -- Stanley Pritchett scored two touchdowns 
to help the Gamecocks (2-1) defeat the Bulldogs (1-2) in a nonconference game 
at Columbia, S.C.

ACC ROUNDUP; BROOKS RETURNS TO HELP FLORIDA STATE TO 56-14 ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Derrick Brooks fooled them all. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior linebacker looked slow and rusty in practice last week, but he 
returned from a two-game suspension Saturday night to cause a fumble and block 
a punt, helping third-ranked Florida State roll over Wake Forest, 56-14, at 
Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the coaches) thought I was a little sluggish all week because I wasn't 
running around, whooping and raving," said Brooks, who had five tackles and one 
sack in his 1994 debut. "I was just going through the motions. But when I got 
here to the stadium it was a new ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stepped my attention up a little bit and I was fortunate enough to go out 
there and make a few plays." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seminoles (3-0) won their 19th consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference game 
since entering the league three seasons ago and moved within two of Maryland's 
mark of 21 in a row set in the 1970s. Florida State also has a jump on its 
third consecutive ACC title with three season-opening conference victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake Forest (1-2, 0-1) trailed after the first quarter, 21-0, and at halftime, 
42-0. The Demon Deacons also played the second half without starting 
quarterback Rusty LaRue, who suffered a concussion when hit hard on a pass play 
just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, who didn't start but was a team captain, returned to action with 
running back Tiger McMillon and offensive lineman Marcus Long from two-game 
suspensions imposed for taking part in a shopping spree at a Tallahassee, Fla., 
sporting goods store last season. Two other Seminoles players are still serving 
suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks entered the game on the fourth play, after Devin Bush's 33-yard 
interception return for a score was nullified by an offsides penalty. Brooks 
caused a fumble on the next play and 1:53 later the Seminoles led, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 16 North Carolina 49, Tulane 0 -- Jason Stanicek became North Carolina's 
all-time passing leader and also ran for two touchdowns at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanicek completed seven of 15 passes for 161 yards and two touchdowns. His 
career passing yardage reached 3,852, surpassing the mark of 3,840 by Matt 
Kupec from 1976-79. Stanicek also ran for touchdowns of 11 and seven yards, the 
first time he has run for two touchdowns in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to him before the year started and he told me he wanted me to break 
his records," Stanicek said. "I feel great about doing it, but now I'm glad 
it's behind me and I can look forward to the rest of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina (2-0) also got a little more production from its tailbacks 
after they struggled in the opener against Texas Christian. Curtis Johnson ran 
for 65 yards and a touchdown, and Leon Johnson added 72 yards and a 
fourth-quarter score. Last year, the Johnsons each rushed for more than 1,000 
yards, but Stanicek led the running attack against TCU. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulane (1-2) committed five turnovers, and the defense gave up several key 
third-down plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland 24, West Virginia 13 -- Allen Williams rushed for 163 yards -- almost 
100 more than Maryland had managed in its two previous games -- and Kevin Foley 
passed for 287 to lead the Terrapins at Morgantown, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland (1-2) entered the game averaging only 33.5 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia (1-3) lost for the first time in 11 home games. The 
Mountaineers, 11-1 last season, are averaging only 10.25 points per game after 
managing only two field goals and a touchdown against Maryland, which ranked 
105th in points given up. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia 9, Clemson 6 -- Freshman Ronde Barber's interception with 1:49 to 
play made up for a slew of Cavalier miscues and set up the winning score at 
Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber picked off a pass by Louis Solomon and returned it 35 yards to the 
Clemson five. 
</P>
<P>
 Four plays later, Rafael Garcia kicked a 19-yard field goal with 26 seconds 
left to give Virginia (2-1, 1-1) only its second victory over the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson (1-2) is 0-2 in the ACC for the second time in three years.

LOUISVILLE FIELD GOAL DEFEATS ARIZONA STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Akers kicked a 31-yard field goal with 49 seconds to play Saturday 
night, lifting Louisville to a 25-22 victory over Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State (1-1) got the ball on its 30 but Jake Plummer threw two 
interceptions and was sacked twice before the final gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville (1-2), despite committing 17 penalties for 154 yards, put together 
a winning drive led by backup quarterback Jason Payne. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville got the ball at its 49 after stopping the Sun Devils with 4:30 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 On second and six from the Arizona State 33, Eric Schmidt tackled Payne for a 
big loss, but Schmidt was called for a 15-yard personal-foul penalty for 
grabbing Payne's face mask. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave the Cardinals a first down on the Sun Devil 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Shelman, trying to get Louisville into field-goal position, carried 
into the middle of the field for a one-yard gain to the Sun Devil 14 on his 
27th carry. He ran for 112 yards. Arizona State called its last timeout with 53 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville had tied the score at 22-22 with 4:53 remaining when Shelman scored 
on a two-yard run and Akers added the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive started at the Louisville 20 with 10:57 to play. On a first-and-20 
play, quarterback Marty Lowe passed 31 yards to Jamie Asher, putting the ball 
on the Arizona State 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelman carried five of the next six plays, gaining 22 yards at the end of the 
drive.

OLIVER LEADS FRESNO STATE TO 24-14 VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerome Oliver rushed for 220 yards and scored two touchdowns Saturday night to 
lead Fresno State to a 24-14 victory over Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver, replacing injured tailback Michael Pittman, made his first collegiate 
start and set a Fresno State record with 37 carries, breaking the old mark of 
34 shared by three others.The 220 yards was third-best in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State (2-2), which has won its last 12 home games, took a 7-0 lead in 
the first quarter on a one-yard run by Sal Mejico. Oliver set up the score with 
a 27-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State (1-2) had two scoring chances in the second quarter but lost the 
ball on fumbles deep in Fresno State territory both times. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Richie Donati replaced ineffective starter Adrian Claiborne at 
quarterback to start the second half for Fresno State and guided the Bulldogs 
to 10 third-quarter points.

ALLAN MALAMUD: GOOD NEWS FOR BRUINS COMES NEXT SEASON: NO NEBRASKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J.J. Stokes didn't suit up for UCLA Saturday, but Jerry Rice and Sterling 
Sharpe could have and the Bruins still wouldn't have put much of a scare into 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Those people don't play defense. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Bruins needed was a Cortez Kennedy in the line, a Ken Norton Jr. at 
linebacker and a Deion Sanders in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it might have been close. 
</P>
<P>
 The great mismatch on the Great Plains was the Big Red's jumbo, veteran 
offensive line against the Bruins' undersized, green defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Rob Zatechka, guard Joel Wilks, center Aaron Graham, guard Brenden 
Stai, tackle Zach Wiegert and tight end Matt Shaw -- reading left to right -- 
opened holes big enough for you or me to run through. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve Cornhusker ballcarriers ran for 484 yards, a 7.4-yard average, and five 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 They improved upon a 446-yard average that had been good enough to lead the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the ninth of Coach Tom Osborne's 22 teams to be crowned NCAA 
rushing champions. 
</P>
<P>
 A fullback , Corey Schlesinger, is averaging nearly eight yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
 His hobby is driving in demolition derbies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Phillips, a sophomore I-back from Baldwin Park, rushed for 178 yards 
during the 49-21 victory over the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran 19 times. If Osborne had seen fit, Phillips probably could have run 
another 19 times for another 178 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips was virtually unstoppable on sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 In other years, some Bruin defensive back about to become a first-round draft 
pick might have come up and nailed Phillips before he bounded into full flight. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, Coach Terry Donahue started three sophomores and a junior in 
the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yes, the Cornhuskers' backfield also includes a bona fide Heisman Trophy 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the double-threat quarterback, Tommie Frazier, who passed for two 
touchdowns, ran for another, and scored a couple of two-point conversions. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, his numbers were nothing special. 
</P>
<P>
 He passed for only 59 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not looking to make him into Joe Montana," Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran for only 29, but, make no mistake about it, he is the guy most 
responsible for keeping Nebraska rivals off balance and guessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those kept on his heels for much of a clear, 74-degree afternoon was 
UCLA nose guard George Kase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frazier is the best player we've faced," he said. "He's smart and he reads 
defenses very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Kase, 245, had to try to fight off the surge of a center who weighs 280, 
guards who weigh 300 and 280, and tackles who weigh 315 and 300. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're big, strong and quick," he said. "They beat us up today." 
</P>
<P>
 Kase noticed a difference from last year when the Cornhuskers rushed for a 
total of 208 yards in a 14-13 victory over the Bruins at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot different playing them here," he said. "They're so much more 
intense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers put on their game face as early as Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd estimated at 35,000 roared when the team was introduced during a pep 
rally that also served to dedicate a couple of new video boards. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the Cornhuskers gave those boards a workout as they scored as 
many points as any team ever has against Donahue-coached Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Red was on the verge of scoring at least six more in the closing 
moments, but the Bruins put on a successful goal-line stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the strangest thing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 As they ran into the tunnel on the way to the dressing room, the visitors were 
applauded by Nebraska fans in the stands and on the ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't being facetious, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they have come to feel sorry for the teams who have come to Memorial 
Stadium since September of 1991 and lost 18 consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two weeks on national television, UCLA and USC have been 
outscored, 87-35, by Nebraska and Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat was the Bruins' sixth in their last seven games against the 
Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we've got Nebraska just where we want them," UCLA Athletic Director Pete 
Dalis said. "We don't play them next year."

UTAH AND MCCOY LOOK LIKE THE REAL THING, 34-16; NONCONFERENCE: UTES STAY 
UNBEATEN AS QUARTERBACK PASSES FOR 309 YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST OREGON.

 There's an unbeaten major college football team in Utah, and it's not Brigham 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's Mike McCoy won his duel with Oregon quarterback Danny O'Neil on 
Saturday, completing 28 of 39 passes for 309 yards and two touchdowns to help 
Utah (3-0) to a 34-16 victory over the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is really going to let a lot of teams know, not just in our 
conference but nationally, that we're for real," McCoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Leary intercepted two of O'Neil's passes late in the second quarter 
after the Ducks (1-2) had taken a 10-7 lead, returning the second 38 yards for 
a touchdown to put Utah ahead at halftime, 21-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quarterback kind of gave that one away," Leary said. "He kind of let me 
know it wascoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to bat it down because I thought I couldn't go ahead and make the 
play on the ball. At the last second, I just said, 'Go ahead and do the things 
that you're blessed to do.' Once I got it, I knew I was going to the end zone. 
Nobody was going to catch me." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary returned his first interception 39 yards to the Oregon 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's drive stalled on the Oregon nine, but holder Jason Jones ran up the 
middle on a fake field goal for a touchdown to give Utah the lead for good, 
14-10, with 2:25 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Oregon used a pair of trick plays, including one in which O'Neil 
caught a 14-yard pass, to drive to the Utah 19. But fullback Palou Malepeai 
fumbled and the Utes' Luther Ellis recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a simple play that we've run for four years," said O'Neil, who completed 
19 of 39 passes for 164 yards. "It's one of those things that you can't believe 
happened. Those kinds of mistakes are killing us." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon took the second-half kickoff and scored at the end of a seven-play, 
68-yard drive. Dino Philyaw got his second touchdown on a 16-yard run to cut 
Utah's lead to 21-16. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy put the game away with touchdown passes of 25 yards to Deron Claiborne 
with 1:03 to play in the third quarter and six yards to Rob Hamilton with 5:29 
remaining in the game.

 Matthew Harding blocked a punt to set up a touchdown, then scored on another 
block as Hawaii, its special teams making up for a struggling offense, stunned 
California, 21-7, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Longwell, Cal's punter and kicker, missed two field-goal attempts in 
addition to having two punts blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Two holding penalties, one that negated a 55-yard punt, left Cal facing fourth 
and 47 at its 26 early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, a junior from San Dimas High, swept in unblocked from the right to 
smother Longwell's punt and Khary Williams picked up the ball and returned it 
20 yards for a touchdown that tied the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Longwell had a second punt blocked early in the third quarter when Robby 
Blakeney burst through the middle. Harding scooped up the ball at the Cal 16 
and scored untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii (2-1) also sacked California quarterback Dave Barr eight times.

STANFORD RUNS WILD, ROUTS SAN JOSE STATE

<P>
 Stanford has nine rushing touchdowns in two games this year, matching its 
total for all of last season. And the running game was the key Saturday in a 
51-20 victory over San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Steve Stenstrom had three scoring passes and tied Jim Plunkett as the 
winningest quarterback in Stanford history. But he didn't throw in the first 
quarter as the Cardinal established its running game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mitchell ran 21 times for 179 yards and touchdowns of 52, one and three 
yards as Stanford (1-0-1) opened huge holes in the defense of the Spartans 
(0-3), who have given up 150 points in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Running the ball was the whole focus of our week, because we've got to run 
the ball in the Pac-10," said Mitchell, whose team begins conference play 
against Arizona next week at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal ran for 314 yards, the most since Stanford had 322 yards against 
California in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom, who got his 22nd collegiate victory, completed 14 of 18 passes for 
231 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom completed scoring passes of 19 and eight yards to Justin Armour and 
38 yards to tight end Tommy Hanson. He tied former Oregon quarterback Bill 
Musgrave for second place on the Pac-10's all-time list with his 60th touchdown 
pass. John Elway had 77 for Stanford from 1979-82. 
</P>
<P>
 Alli Abrew had three touchdown passes for San Jose State. He had scoring 
passes of 16 and 25 yards to Jacobbi Williams and a four-yard touchdown pass to 
Brian Roche.

MIGHTY DUCKS NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; LADOUCEUR GETS SOME SECURITY WITH 
TWO-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With 12 NHL seasons behind him, defenseman Randy Ladouceur knows he's not 
going to get "a long-term, multiyear deal, as they say in the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mighty Ducks have shown their captain they expect him to be playing 
for them a while longer, re-signing him to a two-year contract that will pay 
him about $600,000 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 That's more than rookies Paul Kariya and Oleg Tverdovsky will make in base 
salary this season, although there's a very big catch: Both received 
seven-figure signing bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for Ladouceur, 34, is the way his contract is structured. His 
previous contract, negotiated when he was with Hartford, required him to play a 
minimum number of games to maximize his salary. That protected the club from 
poor play or nagging injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 But after he appeared in a career-high 81 games last season -- including the 
800th of his career -- the Ducks decided to guarantee the full amount. 
</P>
<P>
 (General Manager Jack Ferreira) has given me a good deal. I'm very happy," 
Ladouceur said. "At this point in my career, it would be disappointing if all 
of a sudden I went down with an injury and it ended up costing me." 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half ago, Whaler management was already steering him toward a 
coaching career. Not so fast, Ladouceur says. 
</P>
<P>
 "My original plan was to play as long as I could," he said. "'I've stayed 
fairly healthy and I've felt good the last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking it year by year. I'm having a great time and I'd love to stay in 
the game in some capacity after I'm through playing, whether it's in this 
organization or another." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rookies Kariya and Valeri Karpov will make their home exhibition debuts 
tonight in a 6 p.m. game against Vancouver at The Pond. The Ducks are 0-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those not scheduled to play are rookie defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky, who 
has been slowed by a groin injury, and veteran forwards Garry Valk, Stephan 
Lebeau, Terry Yake and Todd Ewen. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel Bure will not be in uniform for the Canucks (3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The team also announced the signings of forwards Shaun Van Allen and Denny 
Lambert, as well as minor league forward Dean Ewen and goalie John Tanner. 
Playing out their options are minor league goalie Allan Bester, defenseman Mark 
Ferner and forward Brian Sullivan.

 Don Barbara drove in the winning run with a sacrifice fly in the sixth inning 
as the Albuquerque Dukes beat the Vancouver Canadians, 3-2, on Saturday to win 
the Pacific Coast League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Osuna pitched 3 2/3 innings of one-hit relief and Antonio Osuma got the 
final two outs for the save. 
</P>
<P>
 Albuquerque beat Vancouver, 2-0, in 11 innings on Friday night to force the 
fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dukes, managed by former Dodger catcher Rick Dempsey, are the top farm 
club of the Dodgers, and the Canadians are the Angels' triple-A team. 
</P>
<P>
 Albuquerque took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on Ron Coomer's infield 
groundout. Vancouver tied the score in the fourth on designated hitter Luis 
Raven's leadoff homer and took the lead on P.J. Forbes' sacrifice fly in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Ashley tied the score in the sixth with an RBI groundout before 
Barbara's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver starter Shad Williams took the loss.

<P>
 In what was supposed to be the toughest test of his career, Holy Bull scored a 
five-length victory in the Woodward Stakes at Belmont on Saturday, virtually 
clinching the 3-year-old and horse-of-the-year titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Jimmy Croll was adamant that this was Holy Bull's last start of the 
year. He won't enter the Breeders' Cup, which usually determines the winners of 
the Eclipse Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull took the lead from Southland-based Bertrando on the far turn and 
extended his margin through the stretch. "It was unbelievable," jockey Mike 
Smith said. "I felt like he was growing wings." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull covered the 1 1/8 miles in 1:46 4/5, with Devil His Due second and 
Colonial Affair third. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodward was one of six Grade I stakes on the card. Trainer Wayne Lukas' 
undefeated 2-year-old filly, Flanders, won the one-mile Matron; Montreal Red 
won the Futurity Stakes; Sky Beauty won the Ruffian Handicap despite carrying 
130 pounds; Royal Mountain Inn won the Man o' War, and Harlan won the Vosburgh.

</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Ricardo Lopez knocked down Yodsing au Saengmorokot of Thailand twice 
in the first round and retained his World Boxing Council strawweight title when 
the referee stopped the fight. . . . Axel Schulz of Germany outpointed former 
World Boxing Assn. heavyweight champion James (Bonecrusher) Smith in a 10-round 
bout in Leverkusen, Germany. Smith, 41, was fighting for the first time since 
being stopped in the third round by Lionel Butler in January. . . . Former 
world heavyweight champion Mike Weaver stopped fellow American Bill Corrigan in 
the second round at Macao. Auto Racing

 Emerson Fittipaldi won the pole position for the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix 
at Nazareth Speedway in Nazareth, Pa., with a record-breaking lap. The

surpassing the 181.435 set in 1992 by Michael Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Benson Jr. took the lead late in the SplitFire 200 at Dover, Del., when 
Jason Keller tangled with a lapped car and held on for his first victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Prudhomme kept the top spot in top fuel qualifying for today's NHRA 
Pioneer Electronics Keystone Nationals in Mohnton, Pa. John Force led the funny

 The Mighty Ducks re-signed veteran defenseman Randy Ladouceur to a two-year 
contract that will pay him about $600,000 this season. Ladouceur, 34, is in his 
13th NHL season. The team also signed forwards Shaun Van Allen and Denny 
Lambert and minor league forward Dean Ewen and goalie John Tanner. Minor league 
goalie Allan Bester, defenseman Mark Ferner and forward Brian Sullivan are 
playing out their options.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; EXPOS' JOY IS REPLACED BY ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They have the best record in baseball but no place to show it off. 
</P>
<P>
 The satisfaction and fulfillment the Montreal Expos were experiencing before 
the players walked out on Aug. 12 has been replaced, General Manager Kevin 
Malone said, by frustration, disappointment and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've declared the Expos to be the champions of baseball based on our record, 
but I would say the future of the team is in jeopardy, and maybe the franchise 
as well," Malone said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancellation of the playoffs and World Series has left Malone facing the 
uncertainty of a hard winter, during which it will be difficult to keep his 
small-market team together, no matter what system is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Walker is eligible for free agency and seven of the best Expos are 
eligible for arbitration, among them Marquis Grissom, Moises Alou, Ken Hill and 
John Wetteland. 
</P>
<P>
 Committed to scouting and development, Malone -- and predecessors Dan Duquette 
and Dave Dombrowski -- assembled a team that was 74-40 with a six-game lead 
over the vaunted Atlanta Braves in the National League East when the season 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we accomplished was pretty remarkable," Malone said. "We had proved we 
were better than the Braves. We had the best record in baseball and were the 
best team in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta had a $40.5-million payroll. Montreal's was $18.6 million. Only the 
San Diego Padre payroll was lower, $13.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The Expos, Malone said, have lost $10 million-$15 million as it is, and $20 
million if they had reached the World Series. Even if Walker goes, he said, the 
payroll will increase by $7 million in the wake of losing $20 million "and we 
can't afford to let that happen." One or two other key players will have to be 
moved during what he foresees as "a very active winter, depending on the system 
and how many other clubs I can interest." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a team capable of winning a world championship, but we're looking at 
another rebuilding year in 1995," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this doesn't become another Pittsburgh, but all the signs are pointing 
in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The players union likes to cite the Expos as an example of how a small-market 
team can survive in the current system, but management's response is that if 
you have to break up the team right away, it's not really a success story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salaries are the only flexible area I see," owner Claude Brochu said. "We 
aren't going to take the losses. Our club isn't highly leveraged, so we'll be 
fine that way, but I have no intention of absorbing the debts. We'll find a way 
of getting the losses off the books. That's the way it is under the current 
system. We need a salary cap to compete on a yearly basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Malone: "We hadn't wavered from scouting and development and felt this 
was the year we'd reap the rewards. My greatest disappointment is for many of 
those on our staff who had made financial sacrifices and not taken raises so we 
could put that money into our major league budget. Now many of those same 
people have had to be laid off, and that's a deep hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also had begun to make a definite turnaround in our support here, cutting 
into the hockey crowd. Everything seemed ready to take off, including TV and 
broadcasting contracts and corporate sponsorships and season-ticket purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so close, but now there are questions about Montreal's continuing 
existence as a franchise. That's why I feel we paid the biggest price. We had 
the most to lose. We were something of the sacrificial lamb in all of this." 
CLEVELAND CRUSH 
</P>
<P>
 Next to Montreal, nowhere were the strike and ultimate cancellation more 
devastating than in Cleveland, where the Indians were 18,000 tickets away from 
3 million. The new Jacobs Field symbolized the city's renaissance, and the 
Indians were only one game behind the Chicago White Sox in the American League 
Central, with a chance for their first postseason appearance since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. was so distraught by the lost opportunities that he 
broke down and cried during a TV interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager John Hart, who had creatively built the team and reshaped the 
payroll by trading high-salaried veterans and then buying the best of his 
talented young players out of arbitration with multiyear contracts, said with 
emotion: 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is one club that should never have been on strike, it's this one. 
Why would our guys go on strike? Every one of them has been nurtured. We've 
given many of them long-term contracts at a point in their careers when many 
clubs would have wanted to see another year or two. I mean, the union has used 
us as an example of the way it should be done, and yet our guys are out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a . . . system, and the players have got to come to grips with the 
fact that it's not working. There are a lot of people losing money. We're 
headed for disaster if it continues." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many teams face an uncertain winter, the Indians, at least, have many 
of their key players under contract for next year and beyond. The list includes 
Alomar, Dennis Martinez, Carlos Baerga, Albert Belle, Kenny Lofton, Paul 
Sorrento, Mark Clark and Jim Thome. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Murray signed a one-year, $3-million deal as a free agent last winter, 
with an option for '95 at $3 million. The option became guaranteed if he 
started 145 games or made 550 plate appearances. The strike prevented that, but 
he had a contract provision pro-rating those numbers in the event of a strike, 
and on that basis Murray will be back. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Dave Winfield, whom the Indians acquired from the Minnesota Twins for 
potential postseason insurance after the strike started, Hart said, "Not 
knowing the system or the makeup of our club, it's difficult to say. We'll 
handle Dave the same way we handle a lot of our guys. We'll evaluate our needs 
as we go through the winter and see where he fits in." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart reflected on his belief that the competitive balance will deteriorate if 
the revenue disparity isn't addressed and said, "The consequences of not 
getting a deal done is that, sure, we could go on kicking Minnesota's butt and 
Milwaukee's butt, and some of the other teams in trouble. We could kick their 
butts year after year. You can have teams put players in uniforms just to fill 
out a team, but what good is that? How is that good for the game?" MVP OF . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Astro first baseman Jeff Bagwell is certain to win the National 
League's most-valuable-player award. He'll be happy about it, he said. "But 
embarrassed too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be forever etched in stone that he was the guy who was the MVP of 
that strike year," he said. "It's embarrassing to me to be a part of a baseball 
season that won't have a World Series for the first time in 90 years. We may 
have to give something back to get (the negotiations) done. It's not getting 
done the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 If Bagwell is voted the MVP, he will receive his full $100,000 bonus, General 
Manager Bob Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word prorated came up in our discussions, but we won't do that," Watson 
said. "He did not prorate his season. He did his thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell batted .368 with 39 homers and 116 runs batted in. GRIEVING 
</P>
<P>
 How could the Texas Rangers fire Tom Grieve, the general manager of a 
first-place team? Well, the Rangers won the American League West title with a 
52-62 record, worst of any first-place team in the history of any major 
American sports league. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the league's fourth-worst record, the Rangers' second losing record in 
the last three years and a continuation of 10 generally mediocre years under 
the deliberate Grieve. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the club's top four minor league affiliates had losing records, 
the top two affiliates did not put a player on a postseason all-star team and 
the Rangers gave up their first-round picks in the last two amateur drafts as 
compensation for signing free-agents Will Clark and Tom Henke. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point we have to say, 'Let's let somebody else take a look at it and 
see if they can put it together in a different way,' " club President Tom 
Schieffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant General Manager Sandy Johnson will get the first shot, but it's an 
interim assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieve handled it with class. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had every opportunity to succeed, and didn't," he said. "I regret that. 
I'm very disappointed in that. I'm disappointed in my own performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was Whitey Herzog, who was fired (as manager) in 1973 after being told 
he would have a chance to build a team, I'd be bitter. If I was some other 
people who have been fired under unfortunate circumstances, I'd be bitter. But 
I don't have an ounce of bitterness. All you ask for in this job is to be able 
to sink or swim based on your own ability. I believe I was given that 
opportunity." NEW YORK NOTEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 -- Third baseman Steve Buechele of the Chicago Cubs, on the owners' demand for 
a system of cost certainty: "They want to know what it'll cost to play 
baseball. What does that mean? The only thing I think it means is that they 
don't know how to run their business. It's called a budget, gentlemen. Find one 
and use it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Montreal and Cleveland and Houston have done it. Teams like Cleveland and 
Houston have locked up their core of young players in multiyear contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one forced them to do that and no one forced those terrific young players 
to sign the contracts. But it gave the players security and that's why they 
took it. It will cost those players money in the long run and the team will 
save money while knowing what their cost will be. That's how those teams did 
their own salary cap and secured their cost of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other teams who don't do that don't know how to run a business. They want 
the players to do it. What we're talking about here is mismanagement, and 
that's the whole problem." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Florida Marlin Manager Rene Lachemann, on the duration of the strike: "When 
the strike started, I told a lot of you I was treating it like a rain-out. 
Well, this rain's lasted about 40 days. It's about time we built the ark." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Minnesota owner Carl Pohlad, on the solidarity of the owners: "In the last 
four or five labor negotiations, the owners have always folded. But there's 
nothing to fold with today, because there's no more water in the well. The 
players badly miscalculated." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cleveland General Manager John Hart, on the uncertainty of the winter: 
"This is not a good year to be a free agent. So you file for free agency, so 
what? There's no deal, so nobody calls you. You're sitting at home and the 
clock is ticking. And what about a guy who's 40 years old, and next year is his 
last big shot to make the big money? Is he going to stay out come next spring?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Boston Red Sox outfielder Andre Dawson on the likelihood he will play 
another year after planning to retire before the strike: "There's something 
inside me that says I should go out in better circumstances. I'll probably give 
it one more shot. That way, I think I may be comfortable with the fact that my 
career pretty much ended with me retiring like I want to." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chicago White Sox General Manager Ron Schueler, on the possibility of 
losing free agents Jack McDowell, Darrin Jackson and Julio Franco without 
getting the World Series shot that the White Sox almost got last year: "This 
was the year we could have done something special, and that's what is so 
frustrating. I thought we really grew as a team last year and this would be our 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we don't have that chance to find out how good we are. I mean, we've lost 
a lot of money and the budget will be affected. Five or six players may not be 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 -- San Francisco General Manager Bob Quinn, on cutting $5 million or more from 
a $40-million payroll, meaning free-agent eligibles Bill Swift and Mike Jackson 
might be allowed to leave, John Burkett (6-8 after his 22 victories of 1993) 
might not be offered a contract and veterans Dave Martinez and Todd Benzinger 
might not be re-signed: "You've heard of the Exterminator? You're looking at 
someone who will have to be very creative. We face as tough a task as any team 
in baseball going into 1995. It's Herculean in nature."

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO LOCK OUT THE PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What if the NHL had a new TV contract and no games to televise? 
</P>
<P>
 The league's new agreement with Fox -- coupled with its marketing deals with 
Nike and Anheuser-Busch -- gives owners a huge incentive to reach an agreement 
with players and avoid a lockout. Getting a national TV contract in the United 
States was one of the key reasons they hired Gary Bettman as commissioner. That 
the deal is with a network that's perceived as hip, a network that this season 
took a daring plunge into the NFL fray and appeals to the same young adult 
audience that is the core of NHL fans, is more than they had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 "These agreements bode well for the future of the sport. They bode well for 
people who do business with us," Bettman said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Will they bode well for the players? 
</P>
<P>
 In the long term, absolutely, because they give the NHL greater visibility and 
credibility. In the short term, no, because owners are so grateful to Bettman 
for arranging those deals, they will back him solidly as he hammers the players 
into accepting some form of salary control. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman already has received authorization to lock out players if there is no 
agreement. He is a tough negotiator, as evidenced by his stance during last 
fall's strike by on-ice officials. He won the four-year deal he wanted, as well 
as the right to fire officials who were judged incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials are not entirely stupid, although it often seems so. Those who 
want a rookie salary cap threw $12.5 million for five years to Alexandre Daigle 
last year, and there were many groans a few weeks ago when the Mighty Ducks 
gave Paul Kariya $6.5 million for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 They see the popularity of in-line skating and roller hockey. They see hockey 
jerseys in rap videos and in fashion magazine layouts. They know the game's 
image is evolving from one of brutality sprinkled with moments of plays too 
fast to follow to a fast, aggressive contest of skills. And they know 
baseball's labor strife has alienated many fans. They want to build on that, 
but as Mighty Duck President Tony Tavares said, "You don't make a bad agreement 
for the sake of one season." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plan proposed by the players Friday centers on a 5% "tax" on revenues, 
including salaries and gate receipts. The players contend it would raise $35 
million, which would be distributed to teams in smaller markets. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some sentiment among the players to accept a salary cap for rookies 
and accept the elimination of arbitration in exchange for more liberal 
free-agency conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are serious about not caving in completely. The players association 
has issued each team's player representative a credit card with a $50,000 
limit, which would be enough to buy players' plane tickets home if there's a 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Messier's demand that the Rangers give him a new contract that will pay 
him $6 million per season and make him the NHL's second-highest paid player -- 
behind Wayne Gretzky's $6.35 million -- has created an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Messier initially wanted a three-year, $18-million deal. He later said he 
would accept a two-year deal worth $6.5 million each season or an adjustment of 
the two seasons on his current contract. He's scheduled to earn $2.682 million 
this season and $2.75 million next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, with what Wayne has done in his career and for the league, he 
deserves to be paid the most," Messier said this week. "And I feel I deserve to 
be behind him for what I've done for the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers' first offer was $4 million per year for three years. They raised 
that to $4.5 million for three years, and on Thursday -- after Ranger officials 
met with their new bosses from the Cablevision-ITT ownership team -- went to 
$15 million for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't satisfy Messier, who has yet to report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are at a stalemate now," Messier's accountant, Barry Klarberg, 
told the New York Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins are unhappy that defenseman Al Iafrate left camp to continue 
rehabilitating his surgically repaired knee at home in Michigan rather than 
allowing the team's medical staff to oversee his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Iafrate departed angrily after medical personnel, eager to gauge his progress 
and plan a rehabilitation program, asked him to skate lightly on Tuesday. 
Iafrate, apparently believing he was being pressured to return sooner than he 
should, balked and went home. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, he'll return to Boston," Iafrate's agent, Rick Curran, said. 
But no one is sure when. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mikko Makela, who played for Finland at the Lillehammer Olympics, is 
attempting to return to the NHL after a three-year absence. He might end up at 
left wing on the Bruins' top line, with Adam Oates and Cam Neely. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Bruins will do on defense is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, who haven't had an enforcer since the days of Jay Miller, have two 
in camp: Marc Potvin, a former King, and Daniel Lacroix. Once considered a 
scorer, Lacroix has topped 200 minutes in penalties in three of his last four 
minor league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have a chorus line of goaltenders auditioning to replace Jon Casey. 
They are hoping draft pick Evgeni Ryabchikov or collegian Blaine Lacher will 
assert himself in exhibitions and win the starting job. Vincent Riendeau, a 
holdover from last season, also is a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov, released by the Devils, has been unable to 
catch on with another NHL team. His $650,000 salary demand and his age (36) 
hurt his cause. . . . Ottawa General Manager Randy Sexton said he expects his 
team to play .500 hockey at home and to challenge for a playoff spot, 
preposterous statements that only set up Coach Rick Bowness for a fall. The 
Senators had a league-worst home record of 8-30-4 and a league-low 37 points 
last season, leaving them 47 points out of the playoffs. . . . Dallas 
defenseman Doug Zmolek is undergoing tests to determine the cause of dizziness 
and an irregular heartbeat he experienced last week. . . . Mike Milbury, 
formerly the Bruins' assistant general manager, will join ESPN as a studio 
analyst. . . . The Senators hired former Whaler coach Pierre McGuire as a 
part-time scout for $10,000 Canadian. Why so cheap? Because the Whalers, who 
fired him after a stormy and dreadful season, still are obligated to pay him 
$200,000. . . . Circle Sept. 24 on your calendar. That's when Mike Keenan takes 
over as coach and general manager of the Blues. He was suspended 60 days for 
what Gary Bettman found to be unethical conduct in jumping from the Rangers to 
the Blues.

CHAPMAN FOOTBALL MAKES IMPRESSIVE COMEBACK; DEBUT: PANTHERS TOPPLE WHITTIER, 
30-13, IN PROGRAM'S FIRST GAME IN 62 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman's return to the gridiron was as close to flawless Orange County 
football as it gets these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Long drives for touchdowns. No fumbles. No interceptions. No punts until the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, playing their first game after a 62-year hiatus, defeated 
Whittier, 30-13, Saturday in front of 4,200 at Newman Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the school fielded a football team, the college was called 
California Christian, the campus was in Los Angeles and Panther football was 
far from fearsome. 
</P>
<P>
 Records are hazy but it's believed the Panthers won only one game in their 
final three seasons before the program was disbanded in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 It was immediately evident that times have changed. No way did California 
Christian have anyone like Curtis Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, a 6-foot-3, 206-pound quarterback, completed nine of 14 passes for 
171 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 101 yards and two touchdowns in 17 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, a junior transfer from Citrus College, was courted by such Division 
I programs as Fresno State and USC -- and Saturday Whittier didn't seem to 
stand a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Whittier had a young defense and he was a little too much for them," 
Chapman Coach Ken Visser said, "although they hit him hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard enough to separate Robinson's shoulder on his first carry, the game's 
second play. Robinson had turned the corner on the option, gaining 14 yards, 
and nearly broke it for a touchdown before defensive back Carter Devol made a 
hard tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Robinson had ice on his throwing shoulder. "It will hurt me 
more tomorrow than tonight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Chapman's first offensive drive, the Panthers drove 92 yards in 14 plays 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some shaky moments. They were forced to call timeout twice during 
the drive. They had an 11-yard touchdown run by Robinson called back because of 
a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 But three plays after the penalty, Robinson hit Dave Poltl in the corner of 
the end zone for a 12-yard touchdown with 4 minutes 6 seconds left in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After Whittier tied the score at 8:56 in the second quarter, Chapman scored 17 
consecutive points. Bill Hamlin kicked a 27-yard field goal, Robinson scored on 
a 17-yard run and then completed a 75-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, a junior from Fullerton College who made four receptions for 157 yards, 
caught the ball at the Whittier 40 and blazed into the end zone, giving the 
Panthers a 24-7 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier cut it to 24-13 early in the fourth quarter, but Robinson ran it in 
from four yards with 8:53 left. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a doubly emotional victory for Visser. For one thing, it was a 
satisfying beginning for a program he started from scratch last December and a 
team that he saw on the field for the first time Sept. 25. For another, it was 
a return to the campus he coached on for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Honestly, I'm glad this game is over," Visser said. "I'm awfully happy to get 
a win. I knew we had good personnel but it's tough to get them together in such 
a short time."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; SADDLEBACK RALLIES, BUT FALLS SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Saddleback put on an impressive second-half rally only to lose, 21-20, to Long 
Beach in a Mission Conference game Saturday in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos trailed, 21-7, as Long Beach dominated with its ground game. 
Patrick Norris had a career-high 275 yards in 29 carries, including a 67-yard 
touchdown run in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Saddleback (0-1) had a chance to win with about a minute left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos pulled within a point, 21-20, when quarterback Aron Garcia 
completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to Jackie Conners. Conners went high to grab 
the ball over a Long Beach defender with 1 minute 3 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Coach Ken Swearingen didn't hesitate in going for two. But Garcia's 
pass was intercepted on the goal line by Jake Beeney after it was deflected. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach recovered Saddleback's onside kick and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does 21-21 give us?" Swearingen said. "We were going for it all the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was most impressive on the final drive, completing three fourth-down 
passes, all for first downs. He was 21 of 37 with three interceptions for 171 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's defense was solid much of the game except for its occasional poor 
tackling of Norris. 
</P>
<P>
 James Ligons and Scott Patton each had two interceptions and Erick Fielding 
had another, but the biggest turnover of the game was a fourth-quarter fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach quarterback Neo Aoga was scrambling around the left end when he was 
hit from behind by linebacker Tony Pellicer, knocking the ball loose. It was 
recovered at the Long Beach 49 by lineman Dan West with 4:49 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The play came 2:24 after Saddleback had scored on a 10-yard pass from Garcia 
to Adrian Brown to cut the lead to 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
 That drive was keyed by a roughing-the-punter call that gave Saddleback a 
first down. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's Garcia had scored on a one-yard drive with 12:37 left in the 
second quarter to tie it, 7-7. Long Beach went ahead, 14-7, on a one-yard run 
by Kevin McKenzie with 4:15 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (2-0) scored again when McKenzie scored on a six-yard run around 
right end with 30 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The touchdown stung the Gauchos, who appeared to have stopped the drive two 
plays before. Saddleback's Morgan Bannister intercepted a pass in the end zone, 
but the Gauchos were called for pass interference. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Mission Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos 35, Orange Coast 31 -- Jeff Clayton rushed for 139 yards and two 
touchdowns and Matt Sauk threw for 199 yards and two touchdowns at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 7-0, Clayton scored the first of his two touchdowns on a one-yard 
run, but Orange Coast missed the point after and trailed, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton scored again on a 29-yard run in the second quarter to tie the score, 
14-14. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling behind, 31-14, Sauk connected with Chris Jackson for touchdowns 
of 58 and seven yards in the third quarter, pulling the Pirates to within seven 
points, 35-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West 35, Pasadena 35 -- Golden West scored two touchdowns in the last 
four minutes, including a two-yard pass from Brian Schneider to Brian Gail with 
1 minute 40 seconds left. The two also connected on a two-point conversion to 
tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena attempted a 32-yard field goal with 13 seconds left, but the kick was 
wide left. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider completed 31 of 51 passes for 354 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West had the ball inside Pasadena's 1 with 7:11 left trailing, 28-21, 
but Mark Crowley fumbled and Pasadena's Daniel Stewart recovered and returned 
it 69 yards, leading to Pasadena's last touchdown.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / STEVE HENSON: CAMARILLO TAILBACKS FIND FRIEND IN MULLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As unrelenting as a snowplow, Mike Muller clears the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who follow him change with the seasons, but Muller is the constant, a 
6-foot-4, 215-pound pathfinder whose favorite phrase is "follow me." 
</P>
<P>
 Muller is Camarillo High's senior fullback, in his third year at the position. 
He is quick to point out that he also plays inside linebacker and earned 
All-Marmonte League honors last season on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Roth Valencia, Robert Smith and Fahali Campbell, Muller has provided 
elements crucial to the livelihood of a tailback: direction and protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia, this year's tailback, rushed for 237 yards and three touchdowns in 
38 carries Friday night, and every number was needed in a 30-27 squeaker over 
Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 With 367 yards in 60 carries in two games, he appears a cinch to become 
Camarillo's third consecutive 1,000-yard rusher, following Campbell (2,285 in 
'92) and Smith (1,130 in '93). 
</P>
<P>
 Check that. Valencia follows only Muller. They all have. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having another lineman blocking for you," Valencia said. "He's a 
real good blocking fullback." 
</P>
<P>
 The headlines, of course, go to the ballcarriers. On Saturday, Muller stared 
at more than one that trumpeted Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've accepted that," Muller said. "It's just the way Camarillo is. It's a 
tailback offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Roles are strictly defined: The tailback carries the ball and the fullback 
leads, blocking a linebacker on a dive or a defensive end on an off-tackle 
play. In two games this year, Muller has gained 21 yards in four carries with a 
touchdown, but he enjoys Valencia's gains as much as the tailback does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always go through the hole first, I always lead," Muller said. "When we 
find a weakness, we run a play over and over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Simple, and simply effective. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sticking it out: Westlake is the fifth high school for quarterback Brian 
Shubin, a senior who has come to regard change as the only valid currency. 
</P>
<P>
 That may change, however. Despite watching most of Westlake's 52-26 victory 
over Ventura from the bench, Shubin is not gazing at greener fields, his father 
insisted Saturday while Brian was at practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it turns out he is the backup quarterback, he accepted that possibility 
when he decided to go to Westlake," Steve Shubin said. "He likes the kids there 
and as far as transferring again so that he can play, I don't think that will 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Shubin began high school at Camarillo, played at Thousand Oaks as a sophomore 
and split last season between Canyon and Taft. It seemed that whenever 
pressured, he fled the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially it was a divorce, then I moved my business, things like that caused 
the moves," Steve Shubin said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, Brian has had to endure the rap of being the kid who went to 
all the schools. But he has kept his grades up and shown dramatic improvement 
as a quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 After sharing equal playing time with Scott Spruill and Steve Aylsworth in 
Westlake's opener, Shubin did not play until midway through the fourth quarter 
against Ventura. He completed five of seven passes for 47 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Spruill, a 6-foot-2 senior, appears to have won the job after completing 13 of 
24 for 289 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 With his son learning to grin and bear it for the first time, Steve Shubin 
sees a touch of irony. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he were at any of the other four high schools he has attended, he would be 
the starting quarterback," the father said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Remember this name: A pair of City Section tailbacks named Smith combined for 
567 yards rushing Friday. And they did it with only 19 carries each. 
</P>
<P>
 Di-onte Smith, a 5-11, 185-pound senior, dashed for a Grant school record 352 
yards in a victory over Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith ran for 573 yards in five games last season before an injury ended his 
season. He already has 495 yards in two games this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Antwane Smith, a year younger, an inch shorter and 15 pounds lighter than 
Di-onte, had 215 yards in a victory over Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for continued improvement from the Kennedy tailback, who enjoys an 
offensive system that Coach Bob Francola calls "a tailback's delight." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith gets most of his carries on a pitch play that allows him to run around 
end, off tackle or cut back across the center before he reaches the line of 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy itself has been a tailback's delight since Francola arrived in 1986, 
sending five to Division I schools. Ontiwaun Carter, Arizona's All-American 
candidate, is the best known. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are Edwin Jones (Iowa State), Ron Hardy (Oregon), Elijah Raphael 
(Washington State) and Donte Scarbrough (San Jose State). 
</P>
<P>
 "All the kids had one ingredient in common: great vision," Francola said. 
"Their eyes catch more of a peripheral view; they don't have tunnel vision. 
That seems to be a characteristic of a truly good tailback." 
</P>
<P>
 Francola believes that Smith, who developed pass-catching and blocking skills 
playing receiver last year, will earn that label. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is well on his way," Francola said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roaring start: Following in the sizable paw prints of Panthers Leodes Van 
Buren and Jason Tucker -- the top two receivers in the state last season -- has 
not caused Eric Mahanke to misstep. 
</P>
<P>
 He had eight catches for 126 yards and two touchdowns for Newbury Park against 
San Marcos on Friday and also intercepted two passes, returning one 60 yards 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt good to show everybody the '94 season is good too, that this team can 
win and work hard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahanke especially wanted to impress one onlooker: Keith Smith, the state's 
all-time leading passer who led Newbury Park to a 14-0 record last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was on the sidelines and I played catch with him. That was great," said 
Mahanke, a two-year starting linebacker who was a reserve receiver last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park (2-0) extended its winning streak to a Ventura County record 16. 
The Panthers, who play Buena this week, have not lost to a Ventura County team 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Probably OK: Caleb Smith, Antelope Valley's standout two-way lineman, is back 
on solid footing after limping off the field Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 His right foot was injured during a pileup, but Coach Brent Newcomb isn't 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something tweaked in there, but it's not swollen," Newcomb said. "We'll have 
the results of X-rays Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 A quick recovery would work well for Antelope Valley, which has not allowed a 
point in two victories. This week the Antelopes visit Bakersfield, the No. 
3-ranked team in the state.

CSUN EXPLOITS DAVIS MISTAKES; MATADORS COAST TO 52-13 WIN THAT LEAVES AGGIES 
REELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defensive back Joseph Vaughn of Cal State Northridge is getting pretty good at 
this interception business. 
</P>
<P>
 Hang around in the secondary for a few plays, wait for the opposition 
quarterback to unload a knuckleball over the middle, then catch it and bolt 
untouched for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy as Saturday night's 52-13 nonconference blitz of UC Davis before 4,518 at 
North Campus Stadium, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, a senior, has returned two interceptions for touchdowns in as many 
weeks. Saturday, the free safety from Sylmar High cruised 81 yards for a 
third-quarter touchdown, his second interception of the night and third of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, that would be 10 touchdowns in as many games at this pace, right, 
Joe? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to do a little more work," said Vaughn, who also recovered a fumbled 
punt. "I had a couple more that I should have caught." 
</P>
<P>
 Catch this: Vaughn's touchdown irrefutably underscored the ease in which 
Northridge (1-1) strafed Davis, which isn't used to being treated so rudely. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a rare laugher at the expense of the Aggies. A cakewalk? Depends 
on who was doing the talking, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't easy," Coach Bob Burt said. "I've never been in an easy game as a 
coach or a player." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matador offense, led by quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin's three scoring 
passes, rolled up 366 yards, most of it in the first three quarters. O'Laughlin 
completed 13 of 21 passes for 246 yards and also scored on a one-yard keeper 
before he was relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we put up big stats and didn't win," said O'Laughlin, who threw 
for 337 yards and five touchdowns in a 48-38 loss to Davis in 1993. "I'm much 
happier with this." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Northridge scored more points was in a 56-20 victory over 
University of San Diego in 1977.  
</P>
<P>
 The rout was among the worst in the history of Davis, whose track record in 
NCAA Division II is storied. Only three times had Davis surrendered more points 
in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the toughest loss I can remember," said second-year Coach Bob Biggs. 
"They got the momentum early and we couldn't establish our offense. It was 
downhill from there." 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the most points allowed by Davis since a 54-0 loss to Cal in 1934, 
when most of the players' parents weren't even born. It was Davis' worst loss 
in point differential since a 41-0 defeat by Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 All this carnage against a team that was 10-2 in 1993 and had beaten 
Northridge in nine of the past 11 meetings. Shoot, Northridge hadn't scored 
more than 20 points in 16 previous meetings with Davis until last season. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the third quarter, Northridge led, 42-0, by which time the 
Matadors had intercepted four Mark Grieb passes. Grieb, a sophomore who was 
making his first start, completed 17 of 30 for 151 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we're not settled at quarterback," Biggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everybody wearing Northridge red and black had a hand in the 
blowout. The Matadors put away the Aggies in a flash -- in 16 seconds, in fact. 
The same thing happened in reverse a week earlier in a 40-19 Northridge loss to 
Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Matadors holding a 14-0 lead, Davis drove to the Northridge 27-yard 
line, but freshman Jeremy Wilgus missed a 45-yard field-goal attempt. A 
heartbeat later, the issue was all but over. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play from scrimmage, O'Laughlin hit David Romines down the left 
sideline. Romines faked defensive back Bobby Bluford, who fell down, allowing 
Romines to scoot 73 yards for a 21-0 lead with five seconds remaining in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 It made for another trivia footnote: It was the longest Northridge touchdown 
pass since Albert Fann scored from 75 yards in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense essentially iced things two plays later, on the first play of the 
second quarter. After an incomplete pass, Vaughn's backfield mate, safety James 
(Scoody) Woods, intercepted a toss over the middle by Grieb. Woods cruised 
untouched into the end zone from 32 yards for a 28-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis misfired in every way, turning the ball over three times in the first 
half -- with two leading to touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis running back Rusty Stivers set the tone when he dropped a handoff on the 
third play of the game. Freshman nose guard Dan Lazarovits recovered at the 
Davis 19-yard line. Four plays later, the Matadors were up, 7-0, after a 
nine-yard run by tailback Mark Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 At the half, by which time Northridge held a 35-0 lead, Davis had managed only 
five rushing yards.

VENTURA IS MORE THAN RESPECTFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura College spent most of last season as a doormat for opposing teams. The 
Pirates scored only 40 points and finished 0-10. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Antelope Valley came visiting Saturday night, Ventura Coach George 
Rosales was thinking about payback and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosales hit the jackpot, as Ventura defeated Antelope Valley, 20-12, in a 
nonconference game at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory -- the Pirates' second in a row -- avenged last year's 35-0 loss 
to Antelope Valley (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have got some confidence that we can play," Rosales said. "We beat a 
pretty good football team tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of first-quarter touchdowns staked Ventura to a 14-0 lead. Ivan McCrae 
scored on a four-yard run and Ira Brown caught a five-yard pass from Aaron 
Trianna. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley countered with a drive in the second quarter. Roosevelt Miller 
scored on a one-yard run for the Marauders to trim the lead to 14-6. Matrai 
Zoltan's kick was wide left. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura running backs McCrae and Gordy Abellera combined for 157 rushing 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Trianna was seven of 20 for 61 yards.

PARRA LAST ACTION HERO FOR CAL LUTHERAN IN THRILLER; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: RECEIVER 
CATCHES 35-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS WITH 1:55 TO PLAY IN 37-34 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The question during Cal Lutheran's 37-34 victory over Claremont-Mudd on 
Saturday was not who would be the hero but who would be the last hero. 
</P>
<P>
 The title rests with Billy Parra, a junior receiver who caught a 35-yard 
touchdown pass with 1 minute 55 seconds to play, retaking the lead for the 
Kingsmen at Stag Field. The game was the season- and Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I just fulfilled one of my dreams," Parra said, "catching a 
game-winning touchdown pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Parra, a Kennedy High graduate who transferred from Cal State Chico, also 
caught a pass on a fourth-and-four play from the Claremont 43, extending the 
decisive drive with 2:47 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Parra caught 12 passes, tying a school record, for 179 yards. But until the 
last three minutes, the hero looked to be Claremont quarterback John Shipp, who 
completed 27 of 43 passes for 377 yards and four touchdowns. Shipp also ran for 
51 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipp, who led the SCIAC in all-purpose yardage last season, rallied the Stags 
from a 10-point deficit in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipp drove Claremont 70 yards in 86 seconds after the Kingsmen had taken a 
30-20 lead. On Claremont's next possession, he drove the team 67 yards in three 
minutes for another score, giving the Stags a 34-30 lead with 4:12 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the Kingsmen looked to be on the verge of losing to a team that 
last season snapped a 25-game winless streak, a team that Cal Lutheran beat, 
44-9, in the teams' last meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 After the kickoff the Kingsmen started at their 37, and the drive reached a 
critical juncture three plays later with Cal Lutheran facing a fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that fourth down, Coach (Joe Harper) looked at me and said, 'Can you do 
it?,' " Parra said. "And I said, 'Yeah.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Ryan Huisenga scrambled and hit Parra for a 19-yard gain. Three 
plays later, on third and eight, Huisenga found Parra over the middle and 
behind the secondary for the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw that play was open early in the game," Parra said, "and Coach said 
we'd go to it sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
 Huisenga finished the game 21 of 37 for 257 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont's final drive was stopped when defensive back Nick Estrada 
intercepted a pass at the Kingsmen 28 with 40 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Interceptions were a problem for both teams. Shipp threw three, one in the Cal 
Lutheran end zone in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Huisenga threw two interceptions in the third quarter, to Bryan Coin, and 
Claremont turned both into touchdowns. The third-quarter swing brought 
Claremont from a 23-7 deficit to within 23-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters for Cal Lutheran was the loss of tailback Terrence 
Thomas, who gained 125 yards in 21 carries in the first three quarters. Thomas 
was bothered by a sore elbow so coaches held him out as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Higbee replaced Thomas and led a 69-yard scoring drive that rebuilt Cal 
Lutheran's lead to 10, but that was when Claremont began the 
second-most-exciting comeback of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was good and ugly in this game," Harper said, "but not too much in 
between."

VALLEY A BIT TOO MUCH FOR WEST L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were more flags than at the United Nations. There was a malfunctioning 
scoreboard that kept going blank. There was even a zany two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh yes, there was a football game in there somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome was a victory for Valley College over West L.A., 27-8, in a 
Western State Conference South Division game Saturday afternoon. The show, 
however, was pure vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams were penalized 26 times for 235 yards, and West L.A. standout 
running back Michael Black was ejected late in the third quarter for a flagrant 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley (2-0, 1-0 in conference play, 1-0 in the division) controlled the 
action -- when a Valley or West L.A. player wasn't caught in one violation or 
another -- and jumped to a 20-0 lead before the Oilers (0-2, 0-1, 0-1) spoiled 
the shutout with less than two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley outgained West L.A., 357-192, and had 23 first downs, including 14 on 
passing plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley sacked Oiler quarterback Ennis Powell four times, with linebacker Brett 
Nordyke getting three of them. Defensive back Dwyer McKeith intercepted two of 
Powell's passes. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, a reasonably satisfying result for Monarch Coach Jim Fenwick. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a tough game," Fenwick said. "They are a physical team and they are 
fast. . . . Bottom line is we came down here to win and we won." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley quarterback Jim Arellanes, a transfer from Northern Arizona, again 
displayed poise and touch by completing 17 of 26 passes for 202 yards and one 
touchdown in little more than two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in a 41-24 victory over Santa Barbara, Arellanes was 28 of 40 for 
402 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, who completed passes to nine receivers, made himself noticeable on 
Valley's first possession, taking the Monarchs 88 yards in 10 plays and capping 
the drive with a one-yard run for a 7-0 lead. His touchdown pass came on a 
five-yard toss to Mark Mahone with 55 seconds left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs also used Davis Delmatoff at quarterback, and the former Hart 
High and Pierce standout responded with 11 completions in 16 attempts for 92 
yards. Delmatoff did not play last week because of a sore foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley's Tim Cronk kicked 40- and 30-yard field goals, and the Monarchs added 
a one-yard touchdown run by Deriek Charles to build a 20-0 cushion late in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore running back Jesus Williams scored for West L.A. on a five-yard run 
with 1:57 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers lined up for the extra-point attempt but the snap was high and 
kicker Omar Moreno scrambled before lateraling to Ron Peebles who then 
connected with Chris Miller in the end zone for the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley's Brian Comer had four receptions for 84 yards, and Jason Leonard 
caught seven for 78 yards.

rolled to a 41-0 victory over host Southern California Christian in a nonleague 
game Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>

28-0 lead. He returned a punt 50 yards for a touchdown early in the quarter, 
then finished with a 55-yard run with 3:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC (1-1) was unable to get its offense moving. The Flames were limited to 
five first downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Buhler, who rushed for nearly 250 yards in SCC's opener two weeks ago, was 
limited to 68 yards in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They out-physicaled us," Flame Coach Bert Esposito said. "We weren't ready. 
On our best day I don't know if we could beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 Templeton took the lead midway through the first quarter when quarterback 
Robert Martin connected with Mike Tomlinson on a two-yard touchdown pass. The 
Eagles (1-1) made it 14-0 when Santos Zertuche went over left tackle from three 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Templeton went ahead, 21-0, when Martin threw an 11-yard pass to Jake 
Marquart, who scored with 1:08 left in the first half. Zertuche went in from 
seven yards with 8:45 left in the third to make it 28-0.

 Top-ranked Newport Harbor faced its first challenge of the season in the 
finals of the Orange County Volleyball Championships, but the Sailors came back 
to defeat Laguna Beach, 15-17, 17-15, 15-4, Saturday at Edison High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors were nearly swept by the third-ranked Artists, who had match point 
in the second game, but were unable to put away two opportunities at the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 14-11, in Game 2, the Artists rallied to tie Newport Harbor after 
the Sailors mishandled two sideout chances and Ashley Englander dinked the ball 
into the open back row. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach then got an ace from Lisa Ravensburg to force match point, but 
the Artists could not put away the Sailors, who were able to sideout on Sara 
Fairborn's kill. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor breathed a little easier after Melissa Schutz won a joust at 
the net to tie the score and Schutz then teamed with Jenny Hecker on a block 
for game point. 
</P>
<P>
 Four sideouts later, setter Christy Collisson's attempt to send back an errant 
pass went wide forcing a third game in 1-hour 45-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Newport Harbor got into gear behind Misty May, who engineered the 
victory with nine of her match-high 29 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor reached the finals by posting one-sided sweeps over Sunny 
Hills, seventh-ranked Huntington Beach and 10th-ranked Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Artists had a much tougher road to the championship match. They had to 
defeat three ranked teams in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 They swept No. 4 Calvary Chapel, 15-8, 15-5, and then had to come back against 
sixth-ranked Mater Dei, 6-15, 15-8, 15-6. In the semifinals, Laguna Beach won a 
see-saw match against eighth-ranked Edison, 18-16, 15-10. DAN ARRITT

 Running back Akil Anderson rushed for 212 yards in 25 carries and scored five 
touchdowns to lead Montclair Prep to a 48-6 rout of Horizon in a nonleague 
football game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson had scoring runs of 29, 18, five, four and two yards.It was the first 
big game for the 6-foot, 200-pound junior, who usually stands back and watches 
senior Darrell Dent capture the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Anderson praised the Montclair Prep defense afterward. The Mounties 
limited Horizon to minus-four yards and forced three turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defense is the center of this team," Anderson said. "When the defense is 
clicking, we can't be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Dent, who is being recruited by Notre Dame and Miami, played quarterback and 
wide receiver. He rushed for 46 yards in two carries, caught one pass for 36 
yards and completed his only passing attempt for seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mounties (2-0) allowed only three yards passing. Safety Henry Bell 
returned an interception 43 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Horizon's only score came on an 89-yard kickoff return in the first quarter.

 Hugo Perez made his debut with the Salsa Saturday night and the veteran 
midfielder from the U.S. national team quickly made his presence felt in the 
American Professional Soccer League. 
</P>

 The victory assured the Salsa a spot in the four-team APSL playoffs, which 
begin Sept. 30. The Salsa is 10-8 with two regular-season games remaining. They 
will play at Vancouver Wednesday night and at home Sept. 25 against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also moved the Salsa into second place in the league behind 
Seattle. Colorado dumped Montreal out of second, 2-1, earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the playoffs, the top team in the regular season will play the fourth-place 
team and the second- and third-place teams will meet in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the successful arrival of Perez was the night's highlight. "He brought a 
whole different dimension to our game," said Rick Davis, Salsa coach and 
general manager. "Take away even the great goal he scored, and he made some 
moves out there tonight that very few players in the world could have made." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez was clearly the most popular player for autograph seekers among the 
crowd of 2,478 after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good feeling," Perez said. "It was important for me to score in my 
first game. It's important to get things started on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
 The game got off to a lively start with the first two shots producing two 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver's Dale Mitchell scored the game's first in the sixth minute on a 
kick into the corner from 20 yards that sailed cleanly past Salsa goalkeeper 
Mike Littman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa came back to tie the score in the eighth minute of the game on a 
goal by Danny Pena, on an assist from Paulinho. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez's goal came in the 26th minute of the first half, with Paulinho, the 
APSL's leading goal-scorer, getting his second assist of the game.

PREP CROSS-COUNTRY ROUNDUP; IRVINE GIRLS AGAIN BEAT NATIONALLY RANKED PENINSULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 14th Newport-Irvine Rotary Club Invitational must have brought about a 
sense of familiarity for Irvine girls' cross-country Coach Randy Rossi. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive year, his Vaquero team defeated a nationally ranked 
Palos Verdes Peninsula team to win the Division I varsity race Saturday on the 
Woodbridge High School campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am thrilled," Rossi said. "I kind of expected a good performance today." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossi's expectations are understandable, coming from a coach who returns five 
of his top seven runners from the team that won the State Division I title last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes that astounding is the fact that the Vaqueros' leading runner, 
Jessica Corbin, an All-Orange County first-team selection by The Times last 
season, did not compete because of a hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole group just really responded to the challenge," Rossi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros edged the Panthers, 50-53, fueled by a third-place finish from 
exchange student Anna Kaisa Niemi, who ran the three-mile course in 18 minutes 
33 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' Division II race, Agoura's Amy Skieresz posted the day's fastest 
time by a girl as she ran away from the competition, finishing in 17:22. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro was the surprise winner of the girls' team title, scoring 37 points. 
The Chargers, led by Briana Frigo's eighth-place finish (18:47), also posted 
the fastest team time (a combination of the team's top five times) of 1:35:09. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliaser Estrada of Santa Ana Valley (18:03), Nancy Dollar of San Clemente 
(18:08) and Santa Margarita's Katie Nuanes (18:18) finished second, third and 
fourth in the Division II race. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley standout Adalberto Sanchez cruised to the fastest time of 
the day, winning the Division I seniors boys' competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have trained a lot more this year," said Sanchez, a senior, about his 
26-second improvement over the same course last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez ran 15:00 to edge Newport Harbor's Shahram DeZahd (15:12) to take top 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Peninsula (76 points) edged the Sailors (80) for the team title 
and won the overall team time trophy as well, posting a 1:18:16 mark. Santa Ana 
(1:19:14) and Katella (1:19:35) finished second and third in the overall team 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar's Tracy Clark won the Division IV varsity race, leading the Sea 
Kings to a team title. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark started in the middle of the pack, but moved to the lead by the halfway 
point and never looked back, finishing in 18:24. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too fast for the early part of the race," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe later in the year I can go out that hard, but not yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park freshman Heather Garritson ran 18:23 to win the Division III 
frosh/soph race, despite having to avoid spectators on the course, one of whom 
she ran into after the mile mark, and a wrong turn just before the mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sunny Hills Invitational boys' race: 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim wins team title -- In the senior boys' race, Chino Ayala's Jeff 
McLarty set the three-mile course record in 15:50 and Sunny Hills' Garrett 
Jensen finished second in 16:13. Anaheim captured first place in the team 
competition, led by Gabriel Valdovinos' eighth-place finish in 17:05. 
</P>
<P>
 In the junior boys' race, Sunny Hills' Ranen Bhattacharya finished second in 
16:55 and Ceasar Serrano (Loara) finished third in the freshman boys' race. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' frosh/soph race, Sunny Hills' Tatiana Berdote finished fourth in 
21:44 and Becky Ihlendorf (Rosary) placed fifth in 21:48. Rosary finished 
third, behind Chino Ayala and Lakewood St. Joseph.

FAIRPLEX; NANCYS FRENCH FRY WINS THE SHEPHARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancys French Fry, under a patient ride from Fernando Valenzuela, caught 
Prospect For Four in mid-stretch and pulled away for a 1 1/2-length victory in 
the $50,000 Phil D. Shephard Stakes at Fairplex Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospect For Four, ridden by David Flores, was unbeaten in four previous races 
at the L.A. County Fair and was in position to make it five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nancys French Fry, running next to last in the 10-horse field most of the 
way, made a strong move around the far turn to win the 1 1/16-mile race in 1:43 
1/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a nice horse to ride," Valenzuela said. "I was a little worried about 
Prospect For Four, but once I got into my horse and he responded, I knew I 
wasn't going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second victory of the day for Valenzuela, whose first came aboard 
Famegame ($6.20) in the eighth race. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who was seeking his third victory of the day, had no excuses. "My 
horse tried hard and he ran his race. I tried to open up on the turn. I knew 
the other horse (Nancys French Fry) was coming. We just got beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Vladmir Cerin, who trains the winner, said Nancys French Fry probably will 
come back in the Pomona Handicap on Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Treasure rode Sticky N Picky to a one-length victory over Pretty 
Sensation, ridden by Brian Green, in the $10,000 First Down Dash Handicap for 
quarter horses.  
</P>
<P>
 Lil Bita Brunch, with a four-race winning streak going into the 350-yard race, 
broke poorly and finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Mike Puhich has returned to work after a recent bout with hepatitis, 
but his workload is lighter because long-time clients Al and Sandee Kirkland 
took about half the horses that had been under his care and turned them over to 
David Hofmans.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the horses Puhich lost was Daros, the winner of the 1992 Del Mar Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oncefortheroad, who stumbled at the start of Friday's Beau Brummel and then 
raced evenly to finish fourth, probably will return in the Gateway to Glory 
Stakes at 1 1/16 miles on Sept. 29.

SAUGUS SPEEDWAY; KELLEY PLACES 4TH TO CLINCH PRO STOCK TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON STAPP, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Kelley might not have been the fastest driver in the second half of the 
Saugus Speedway season. 
</P>
<P>
 That distinction belongs to fellow Pro Stock driver Gerrit Cromsigt of Pine 
Mountain Club, who closed with 11 main-event wins. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kelley might have been the smartest. In the wake of an incredible surge by 
Cromsigt, Kelley, a 27-year-old Arleta resident, was more concerned with 
consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 It paid off. Kelley's fourth-place finish in the 25-lap oval main event 
Saturday night enabled him to clinch the Pro Stock title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew about four or five races ago (Cromsigt) was going to win all the main 
events," said Kelley, who won the Hobby Stock championship in 1989. "We just 
tried to avoid any big mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley did just that, finishing in the top five in 21 of 24 races in his 
fourth season in Pro Stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Cromsigt's streak of 11 consecutive wins came to end when he was involved in 
an accident on the 10th lap of the figure-8 main event.  
</P>
<P>
 In other races, Jeff McCall of Gardena clinched the Mini Stock points 
championship with a third-place finish in the 20-lap main event. McCall, with 
265 points, finished the season 23 ahead of his nearest competitor, Carl 
Edginton of Glendora, who finished fourth in the final race of the season.

FOURTH-QUARTER RALLY CARRIES HANFORD PAST HIGHLAND, 22-21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Wide receiver Carlos French caught a 24-yard touchdown pass from Clayton 
DiPrima with 2 minutes 53 seconds to play Saturday and Eric McGee added the 
go-ahead conversion kick as Hanford High rallied to edge Highland, 22-21, in a 
nonleague game at Quartz Hill High. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the play of quarterback Jason Carr, Highland (0-2) appeared to have 
matters in hand in the second quarter.Trailing, 7-0, Carr threw touchdown 
passes of 15 yards to Norris Theus and eight yards to Dante Lee, and ran two 
yards for a touchdown to give the Bulldogs a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Hanford defense took over at that point to get the visitors back 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Camara, who had opened the scoring with a 44-yard touchdown reception 
from DiPrima, tackled Carr in the end zone to cut the Bulldogs' lead to 21-9 at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Avilia intercepted a Carr pass and returned it 30 yards for a touchdown 
in the third period, narrowing the margin to 21-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr completed 14 of 32 passes for 172 yards and two touchdowns and threw two 
interceptions.

GOLF ROUNDUP; U.S. STUMBLES, STILL HOLDS 12-8 EDGE IN PRESIDENTS CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The International team kept its hopes alive in the inaugural Presidents Cup on 
Saturday, despite getting only a half-point from the world's best player -- 
Nick Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing the United States, 7 1/2-2 1/2, going into the day, the International 
team got 3 1/2 points in morning four-ball play and then picked up two more in 
the afternoon alternating-shot matches to make it 12-8 for the United States 
going into today's 12 singles matches at Gainesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The international team needs to win eight of those 12 matches to force a 
sudden-death playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have no strength at all," Price said. "I think it showed in the way I 
played the last few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton Allem and Mark McNulty defeated Jim Gallagher and John Huston, 4 and 3; 
Tsukasa Watanabe and Vijay Singh took Jay Haas and Scott Hoch, 3 and 1, and 
Craig Parry and Bradley Hughes handled Loren Roberts and Tom Lehman, 4 and 3, 
before the Americans finally got a point. 
</P>
<P>
 In the alternating-shot foursome matches, David Frost and Peter Senior 
defeated Hale Irwin and Jay Haas, 6 and 5, helped by a hole in one when Frost 
knocked in a 210-yard four-iron on No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Love-Gallagher beat Nobilo-Allenby, 7 and 5; Singh-Elkington defeated 
Maggert-Huston, 3 and 2; Roberts-Pavin edged Parry-Allem one-up, coming back 
from three-down after 12 holes, and Mickelson-Lehman beat Hughes-McNulty, 3 and 
2. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jeff Sluman missed a chance to turn the B.C. Open into a runaway, leaving at 
least three birdie putts inches short and recording consecutive bogeys on the 
15th and 16th holes, but still shooting a 67 to extend his lead to two strokes 
over Mike Sullivan with a 54-hole score of 198 in Endicott, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Isao Aoki had an up-and-down round of 64, featuring eight birdies, an eagle 
and two three-putt bogeys that gave him a one-stroke lead after the second 
round of the Senior Tour Bank One Classic in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki had the low round of the day for a 36-hole total of 133, leaving him one 
stroke ahead of Jim Albus and Jimmy Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish rookie Anika Sorenstam made five birdies in shooting a third-round 66 
for a 54-hole total of 205 in taking a one-shot lead after the third round of 
the LPGA Safeco Classic in Kent, Wash.

HYDROPLANE RACING; BOATS ARE DIFFERENT, BUT THEIR GOAL IS THE SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They make a strange couple, Smokin' Joe's and Miss Budweiser, the two boats 
battling for the unlimited hydroplane championship in today's Bayfair '94 race 
on Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 With two events remaining, here and Oct. 16 in Honolulu, Miss Budweiser leads 
by 66 points, 8,288-8,222. There are 1,600 points available in today's three 
heats and five-lap final. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Budweiser, the defending champion, is bright red with white lettering -- 
except for owner Bernie Little's name, which appears on the cowling in large 
gold letters, in keeping with his jewelry. Driver Chip Hanauer's name appears 
in small print on the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 Smokin' Joe's, the challenger, is a garish yellow and purple creature with a 
camel prominently displayed on its deck and sides. Owner Steve Woomer's name 
doesn't even appear on the 30-foot long boat. Driver Mark Tate's name is 
politely displayed on the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an advertising medium," Woomer said. "I don't need any advertising. 
And I'd sell the spot where Tate's name is if it would help us go any faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanauer, 40, winner of seven driver's championships but out of this year's 
contention after two serious accidents, has been racing unlimited hydroplanes 
since 1976, when he graduated from Washington State. A 22-year-old powerboat 
phenom from Port Townsend, Wash., at the time, Hanauer went on to win 53 races, 
including nine Gold Cups. He has also won four times on Mission Bay, twice in 
Atlas Van Lines and once each in Miller American and Circus Circus. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanauer retired after the 1991 season, but after a year's absence returned to 
the cockpit to drive for his longtime rival, Little. This year, when Hanauer 
was ailing, the Bud boat was driven in two races by Mike Hanson, who won at 
Lake Lewisville, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate, 34, is in only his fourth year as an unlimited driver after a long 
career racing inboard hydros. A third-generation racer from Wayne, Mich., Tate 
has won two Gold Cups, a national championship and four races in his four 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-team manager/crew chiefs are the winningest in unlimited history. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Brown, the Miss Bud boss, joined Little in 1986 and directed the boat's 
transition from piston power to turbine, using a 2,750-horsepower Lycoming 
helicopter engine. His boats have won 44 races and seven championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Lucero, Brown's counterpart with Smokin' Joe's, has a record 11 Gold Cups, 
10 national championships and 61 victories. He joined Woomer's Competition 
Specialties team in 1986 after a long career with Bill and Fran Muncey. 
</P>
<P>
 Both contending hulls were built in 1987. Smokin' Joe's began life as the 
Miller American and was the Winston Eagle for five years before this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miss Budweiser on the water this week was pressed into service after the 
team's primary boat, built in 1989, crashed last month on Seattle's Lake 
Washington. The '87 boat was hurried into service the same day after being 
taken from a nearby shopping mall where it was being used in a promotional 
display. 
</P>
<P>
 Although pegged this year as a backup, the '87 hull has won 24 races, sharing 
the record with the Atlas Van Lines Blue Blaster, driven by the late Muncey 
from 1977 to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Smokin' Joe's nor Miss Budweiser qualified as well as anticipated 
Saturday when choppy water held down speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Von's American Dream, with 1992 winner Dave Villwock driving, held on to the 
top qualifying spot with its Friday speed of 166.027 m.p.h. Miss Budweiser 
remained second at 165.247, and Smokin' Joe's moved from fifth to fourth with a 
164.126 lap Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made seven different runs and a total of 16 laps over 160 m.p.h., but we 
just never got the 'magic lap' to set top time," said Hanauer, who has been No. 
1 qualifier in five of this season's six races. 
</P>
<P>
 Racing will begin at 11:30 a.m.

 U.S. Amateur champion Tiger Woods of Stanford won his collegiate debut, 
shooting a four-under-par 68 Saturday for a three-stroke victory over Oklahoma 
State's Alan Bratton in the 40th Tucker Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a Western High graduate who last month became the youngest player to 
win the U.S. Amateur at age 18, had an eight-under 208 total on New Mexico's 
7,246-yard Championship Course. Bratton closed with a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State took the team title with an 864 total. Texas was second at 874, 
followed by Arizona State at 879 and Nevada Las Vegas at 881.

SEASON OF WOES; FEDERAL INVESTIGATION TOPS THE LIST OF SUMMER DISASTERS 
</P>

<P>
 Craig Underwood has a tough time remembering why he once dared to hope. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His hope was always cautious, always tempered -- expressed in a half-sprung 
smile, as close to optimism as a farmer can come. But even that most tentative 
nudge toward hope now looks reckless. 
</P>
<P>
 For this summer has been utterly woeful. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood and his partners -- grower Jim Roberts and sales manager Minos 
Athanassiadis -- are reeling. Their 60-acre investment, a rich field tucked 
just west of the Conejo Grade, has crumbled into calamity. After a hardscrabble 
fall, a break-even winter and a promising spring, it's been a disastrous 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The corn crop lost money. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors threatened lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 And federal investigators cranked up a probe that could cost the partners 
their farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm going to crawl into a hole," Underwood said, his voice bleak on a 
bright summer day. "I want to disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 The sons and grandsons of farmers, all three partners recognized the risks 
when they mortgaged other landholdings in the spring of 1993 to buy the 
tumbledown plot of Ventura County land dubbed Conejo Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Their venture seemed stubborn, even naive -- they were launching a farm while, 
all around them, growers sought to unload land to wealthy developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, about 2 million acres of farmland vanish each year. Ventura 
County, too, has succumbed to suburban sprawl: outlet malls, movie theaters and 
plaintive "For Sale" signs have sprouted on the fertile Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Conejo Ranch partners knew they were bucking a trend. They expected 
challenges. They expected setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But they never expected a federal probe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the Environmental Protection Agency suspect the partners 
may have destroyed a wetland when they bulldozed a thicket of wild plants in 
the summer of 1993 as they prepared to transform Conejo Ranch from a scraggly 
swamp into a tidy farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think wetlands may have been involved on this site, which means the 
farmers would have required a permit (to begin clear-cutting)," EPA attorney 
Jessica Kao said. "This particular site concerns us because it was a fairly 
good area for various kinds of wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when the partners bought the field outside Camarillo, taking out loans 
to cover the $420,000 price tag, they found several quails scurrying among the 
brush. They heard talk of a mountain lion skulking through the mesquite. And 
their mascot mutt, Lucy, emerged from an exploratory romp crawling with ticks. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered about the field, several low-lying pockets sagged into 
quicksand-like pools of silty muck. "You could fish crawdads there," Jim 
Roberts recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the moisture could be attributed to simple geography -- Conejo Ranch 
sits in a flood plain and collects runoff from surrounding hills. The field 
also boasts an unusually high water table. 
</P>
<P>
 But Underwood thought most of the puddles had dribbled onto Conejo Ranch by 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, he said, the culvert draining water from a nearby lemon 
grove had ruptured, diverting the flow toward Conejo Ranch. As the field had 
been abandoned nearly a decade earlier, no one bothered to repair the culvert 
or clear away the sprouting vegetation. So Conejo Ranch, soggy and untended, 
evolved into a swamp. 
</P>
<P>
 So what? 
</P>
<P>
 The land had been devoted to agriculture for more than a century: first as a 
cattle pasture and, later, as a vegetable farm. Clearly, Conejo Ranch was meant 
to be cultivated, the partners reasoned -- even if they had to install an 
underground drainage system to suck moisture from the gooey soil. 
</P>
<P>
 No one ever imagined that the fertile 60-acre swath might be considered a 
wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone probably should have. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whether fed by an underground spring or a leaky air conditioner, any moist 
patch of ground can be classified as a wetland -- as long as its plants, 
hydrology and soil meet certain scientific criteria. The Clean Water Act, which 
gives the government jurisdiction over wetlands, does not distinguish between 
natural and artificial swamps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to get too lyrical or mystical about it," local environmentalist Neil 
Moyer explained, "but given half a chance, Mother Nature will reclaim 
(agriculture land for) wetlands." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the partners razed the vegetation and churned the soil on Conejo Ranch 
last summer, EPA investigators have had trouble determining whether the field 
meets scientific standards that define wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Ranch could have been a teeming riparian habitat before the farmers 
moved in to tame it. On the other hand, it could have been simply a tumbledown, 
waterlogged lot. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA biologist Aaron Setran will have to make the call. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the zeal of investigators collecting blood samples in the O.J. 
Simpson case, Setran rooted through Conejo Ranch in late July, digging up 
spoonfuls of soil and shreds of roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Preserved in plastic bags in his San Francisco office, the samples will 
provide Setran with the clues that could determine Conejo Ranch's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach a decision, Setran will scrutinize the dirt for classic signs of 
wetlands: clay particles, orange streaks of oxidized iron, root specks from 
riparian plants. He will also pore over aerial photos of the site before and 
after the partners began farming. And he will review, again, the site's long 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Setran plans to announce his conclusions by the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict should wrap up the investigation. It could also launch the 
recrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The harshest outcome: a criminal trial. The EPA could file a complaint 
accusing the partners of knowingly destroying a wetland, a violation of the 
federal Clean Water Act. If the partners resist the EPA, the agency could levy 
an "administrative penalty" of up to $125,000, plus criminal penalties of 
$50,000 a day and civil penalties of $25,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 No investigator expects such severe punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next, lesser, level of penalties would hit the farmers nearly as hard: 
The government could force them to pull out the Conejo Ranch crops and restore 
the field to its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA would boot out the existing crops only if scientists were certain the 
parcel could bloom into a thriving riparian ecosystem. A duck pond or two 
wouldn't do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 The land's long history as a cattle-trampled, tractor-tilled farm also works 
in the growers' favor. Far from pristine, the soil "may not have had as high a 
value" as an untouched swamp, even in its heyday, said biologist Cat Brown of 
the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service. "So the penalty, if one is assessed, may not 
be as steep," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of directing the farmers to abandon their field, the EPA might order 
them to pay penance by enhancing a wetland elsewhere in Ventura County. "We 
need to determine what's good for the environment and what's equitable under 
the circumstances," EPA attorney Kao said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to require them to spend an obscene amount of money 
(restoring the field) if we're not going to get an environment of the quality 
we're looking for," Kao said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such talk reassures the partners -- somewhat. "I have to believe it will work 
out," Jim Roberts said, with conviction born of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 But farmers who have tangled with the EPA warn that wetlands problems rarely 
just work out. 
</P>
<P>
 "A wetlands designation is like getting your property declared a national 
park, as far as future use and property values go," Fresno County rancher Shawn 
Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's jurisdiction over wetlands nettles the powerful national farm 
lobby -- primarily because growers complain that bone-dry earth is sometimes 
labeled a protected "water of the United States," based on analysis of plant 
roots or soil composition. 
</P>
<P>
 And once a government scientist declares a parcel wetlands, farmers say, the 
designation is hard to shake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've brought soil scientists, professors, anyone we could possibly tackle to 
come look at our land (and judge whether it's a wetland)," said Rhode Island 
farmer Bill Stamp. "The thing is, (the government) has the dollars -- your tax 
dollars -- and the time. They go after who they want, when they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Stamp, who's trying to clear his former cornfield of a decade-old wetland 
designation, added: "I still salute the flag. But I'll tell you, I think 
twice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While farmers ensnared in wetland disputes tend to paint the government 
ecologists as sinister, land-grabbing foes, environmentalists praise the EPA 
for guarding rare habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area's wetland status . . . predated its use in agriculture by a 
millennium," said Greg Helms of the Environmental Defense Center in Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 With up to 360,000 acres of wetlands falling to plows or pavement each year, 
environmentalists seek to protect every remaining riparian chunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a wetland's destroyed, you lose not only the wetland, but an incredible 
accumulation of biological diversity. And you lose not just individual animals, 
but whole lineages," explained Mark Holmgren, a curator at UC Santa Barbara's 
vertebrate museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood can understand the argument. But he's still bewildered about its 
application on his ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're losing so many wetlands, and once they're paved over, you can't get 
them back, so I suppose they have to investigate," he said. "They have to 
protect our habitat. But in our case, there was really nothing to protect." 
</P>
<P>
 The farmers' battle with the EPA sags under the weight of an age-old conflict: 
agriculture versus the environment. Their second agony of the summer, a 
protracted fight over their compost heap, could be summed up with equally stark 
polarity: agriculture versus the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem flared in early August, when residents of eastern Camarillo caught 
a gut-churning whiff of the decaying compost heap stashed at the far end of 
Conejo Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 A cornucopia of half-rotted vegetables piled high along 300-foot rows, the 
compost heap resembled a macabre banquet, a feast for a giant with a taste for 
decaying fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 More to the point, it stunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Even from a mile away, residents of Camarillo's Leisure Village and Fairfield 
neighborhoods could smell the tangy, musky, caustic fumes. At times, the odor 
turned vaguely chemical, with a tinge of burned plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Some contended the stench could wake them from a dead slumber. Others blamed 
it for scratchy throats or stuffed-up noses. Still others spoke of gripping 
nausea. They dreaded evenings, when the fumes would wrap around their houses, 
sneaking in any window or door left ajar. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, Camarillo resident Andrew Harman said, "It's horrendous." 
</P>
<P>
 The smell haunted Underwood too. With every complaint, he despaired anew. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be bad neighbors," he said, miserably. "And we don't want to 
jeopardize composting in this county." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, few farmers in Ventura County compost on the same scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood Ranches hauls lemon peels and avocado pits from local packinghouses 
to several fields across Ventura County. The partners then add their own 
processing plant's waste -- limp carrots, brittle corn husks, wilted radishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, they toss in shredded paper, sprinkling purple, green and white 
shards on the weirdly vibrant piles. 
</P>
<P>
 The system has proved both cost-effective and environment-friendly over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The packinghouses save big bucks, because Underwood Ranches charges only a 
tenth of the standard fee for dumping trash in a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmers cut costs by reducing their dependence on commercial fertilizer. 
And taxpayers get the satisfaction of knowing that several hundred tons of 
waste are diverted from space-crunched landfills each day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that win-win-win equation can crumble abruptly if the compost heap's 
biochemical balance falters. That's what happened on Conejo Ranch this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, the oxygen pockets in the compost heap collapsed, leaving only 
anaerobic bacteria to gnaw away at the waste. Unable to fully break down the 
material, anaerobic bacteria exhale vinegar, alcohol and hydrogen sulfide after 
every meal. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the same anaerobic bacteria that cause foul smells to accumulate in 
clogged-up sink drains and human bowels. So you can imagine the stench when 
billions of the stinky critters invade an enormous compost heap. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to take a bath when you get home, that's for sure," field worker 
Agustin Garcia said with a wry smile after working amid the stench for six 
hours straight. 
</P>
<P>
 To cut the fumes, Underwood tried covering the compost piles with plastic 
tarp. That didn't work. An attempt to balance the biochemical stew by adding 
shredded paper also flopped. And even when Underwood delivered gifts of fresh 
produce, he failed to pacify the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want it gone," Harman fumed, after rounding up 80 anti-compost signatures 
and threatening a lawsuit. "This has got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood had hoped to leave the pile on Conejo Ranch through Thanksgiving, at 
least, until the waste decomposed enough to be spread as fertilizer. But he 
could not stomach the complaints. At a cost of $7,000, he hauled the pile to 
another of his fields, this one a parcel off Pleasant Valley Road with no 
neighbors nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloomy, Underwood announced: "We raised the white flag and we're turning our 
tails in defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 To make moods even worse, the corn crop was losing money all summer long. The 
farmers had gambled big on corn this year, increasing their plantings 
five-fold. Now the chance of a payoff was slim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been the worst year in 20 or more," Underwood said. "Most people 
cannot remember such a depressed market lasting so long. It started in November 
and it's still going." 
</P>
<P>
 The dismal prices dragged down business even though the partners have finally, 
after three years of research, perfected machines to harvest and process their 
Somis Creek brand corn. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer do workers trudge through the humid fields, hands scuffed by rough 
husks, throats dry from swirling pollen. Technology, speedy and efficient, has 
taken over the drudgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Crashing through the field, attacking each row in turn, the harvester performs 
with violent precision. 
</P>
<P>
 The mighty machine grabs each stalk, plucks out the corn and hurls the ears 
through a stocky conveyor belt, spewing stray leaves like a frustrated gambler 
scattering a deck of cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Miraculously unbruised, the corn bumps down a metal chute and drops into a 
plastic bin hauled by a second tractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Partner Jim Roberts won't say publicly how much money he saves with the 
contraption. Trade secret, he says with a grin. But the harvester demands only 
two workers at a time, and they charge through each row pretty quickly, driving 
their tractors side by side in clumsy choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once the ears are harvested, they're shuttled to Underwood Ranches' cooler, 
where they chill in a refrigerated room. Next, they shoot through the corn 
processor. In a few noisy seconds, corn ears are stripped, trimmed, packaged 
and wrapped as they jostle through a series of conveyor belts. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by the harvester and processor -- $80,000 worth of innovation -- the 
farmers at Underwood Ranches had hoped to command a sizable share of the corn 
market. As hounds Roy and Lucy snuffled underfoot, the partners gathered in an 
airless kitchenette last spring to discuss their prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Relaxing their characteristic caution just a smidgen, they spoke almost 
hopefully. They dreamed of a bumper year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they got the dreadful summer that's just now wrapping up. 
</P>
<P>
 The first inklings of trouble came in mid-June, when the Conejo Ranch corn 
began to "silk," sending out sticky, slender yellow-brown hairs. 
</P>
<P>
 From afar, the field seemed a flawless golden carpet, framed by a snaggletooth 
row of eucalyptus trees, a shrub-blotted mountain and the distant glint of cars 
winding along the Conejo Grade. Up close, the rows of furry tassels beckoned 
alluringly, proud pennants of a ripening crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Majestic. But misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Underwood knew, just from looking, that the corn wouldn't ripen in time 
for the critical opening-season week leading up to Fourth of July. Sure enough, 
the stubborn plants -- whose growth was retarded by a spell of cloudy weather 
-- matured after the holiday. By then, people had eaten their fill of corn. The 
market had gone bust. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With no buyers in sight, the partners didn't even bother sending their 
harvester to Conejo Ranch. They left nearly three acres at the field's 
northwest corner for the birds, the white and yellow kernels swelling slowly 
inside snug green husks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough on us," Athanassiadis said, "to have to leave super-sweet corn for 
ducks." 
</P>
<P>
 Disappointment turned to downright dejection days later, when the produce 
buyer for a major supermarket decided not to stock the Underwood Ranches' corn, 
although he had once discussed purchasing $3,000 worth of corn a day. Another 
deal also fell through, costing the partners about $4,500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk is cheap," Athanassiadis said grimly. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he added: "We've got what literally feels like a noose around our necks 
to sell the product." 
</P>
<P>
 An unexpected contract with the Trader Joe's chain of upscale groceries looked 
like a potential savior in early August. But that deal soon soured, as Trader 
Joe buyers decided they would not stock any product with foam packaging -- 
including Somis Creek corn. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck with more corn than they could sell, the farmers donated bushels to a 
local food bank. They tossed fat, juicy ears on their ill-fated compost heap. 
And they left another patch of bursting-ripe corn to wither in the field. All 
told, they wrote off more than $12,000 worth of harvested corn. They didn't 
even bother to tally the value of the stalks abandoned to the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 As the summer ground on, Athanassiadis looked at the ledger books with 
mounting dismay -- knowing that a run of red ink would crimp his plans to 
introduce two new products this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 He had planned on pushing Rainbow Radishes, a six-ounce bag of salad-ready 
radishes in vibrant hues of purple, pink, red and white. He had also hoped to 
unveil creamy spring potatoes, small and round with flaky, tender skin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But without seed money from the corn crop, he'd have to put everything on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically have to see how much money we have in the bank at the end of the 
season -- it's frustrating," Athanassiadis said, poking at the tan and purple 
potato label he had been tinkering with for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get going, then you have to stop, then you go again, then you stop. To 
the extent that we have good ideas, our business will succeed. But to the 
extent that we have limited money, we're held back on our good ideas. It 
hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Because they grow sweet corn through Christmas -- long after other farmers 
have switched to vegetables -- the partners do have a shot at recouping some of 
their summer losses with strong end-of-season sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But with all that's gone wrong this summer, they're hesitant to hope. History 
of the Field 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating whether Craig Underwood 
and his partners may have destroyed a wetland when they started farming Conejo 
Ranch in the summer of 1993. The partners contend the 60-acre field, which is 
zoned for agricultural use, never harbored a wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 19th Century, the land now called Conejo Ranch served as 
pasture for beef cattle. Adolfo Camarillo owned the parcel during his lifetime, 
from 1888 to 1958, and let his cows range through the tall grass. Several pools 
on the land attracted wildfowl. 
</P>
<P>
 After Camarillo's death, the land was sold to a developer. A plan to build 250 
homes there was rejected by the city of Camarillo. So the land was rented to 
local ranchers, who grew vegetables throughout the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 A great flood in 1979 wiped out the row crops, and the land lay idle for a few 
years. In the early 1980s, ranchers brought back cattle to graze on the wild 
grasses. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1980s, the cattle had been removed, and the 60-acre parcel lay 
fallow. Willow trees, mesquite brush and other scrubby plants soon covered the 
swamp like expanse. A family of mountain lions prowled through the land, and 
quails nested among the brambles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Underwood Ranches partners bought the land in the spring of 1993. After 
checking with the state Department of Fish and Game and the Ventura County 
Flood Control District, they cleared the brush with bulldozers and installed an 
underground system to drain excess water. They then leveled the soil and 
planted mixed greens. Over the summer, they grew sweet corn and built a compost 
heap. They plan a fall crop of carrots.

VOLUNTEER CREWS HIT THE BEACHES FOR COASTAL CLEANUP DAY; ENVIRONMENT: ABOUT 
1,300 PEOPLE PICK UP UNSIGHTLY, DANGEROUS TRASH ALONG THE COAST AND NEARBY 
WATERWAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Up and down the Ventura County coast, volunteers were busy Saturday morning 
filling hundreds upon hundreds of large plastic bags with someone else's trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mission: to cleanse beaches and inland waterways of unsightly debris 
that not only mucks up the ocean but is responsible for the deaths of countless 
marine creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,300 ecology-minded volunteers, young and old, assembled at 27 sites 
around Ventura County from 9 a.m. to noon Saturday to take part in the 10th 
annual California Coastal Cleanup Day. They were joined by thousands of others 
throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We clean about 500 miles of (beaches) all told, but we are stretched out from 
the Oregon border to Baja California," said Nicole Brier of the California 
Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Local efforts were coordinated by Richard Sweet, an analyst with the Ventura 
County Solid Waste Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Project sites along the Ventura County coast ranged from Mobil Oil Pier Beach 
to the north to Leo Carrillo State Beach near the Los Angeles County border. 
Volunteers also plucked refuse from inland watercourses in Santa Paula, 
Moorpark and Newbury Park. A group from Friends of the Channel Islands traveled 
by boat to Anacapa Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet said there was plenty of trash for all: 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette butts galore. Paper stuff -- lots of it and of all kinds. Metal pull 
tabs. Plastic six-pack rings and a plastic eyeball. Clothing and shoes. Tires, 
tables, chairs and a few shopping carts. A lobster trap and a volleyball net. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everything, said Newbury Park resident Carol Parker, who 
volunteered at Marina Park in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing what people don't consider trash -- they just don't consider 
littering at all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's husband, Vann, has worked as site captain at Marina Park for the past 
four years. Vann Parker, a research scientist at Amgen in Thousand Oaks, 
recruited 20 of his colleagues to help out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy the ocean, and one thing that I try and do is facilitate (cleanup 
efforts)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Wright, 40, is a scientist at Amgen. He traveled to Marina Park from 
Thousand Oaks with his son, John, 10, and two young friends, Michael and Tim 
Collinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fun, structured thing for the kids to do," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides some spent fireworks and a rifle shell, not all of what the bunch 
gathered would be considered everyday litter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found some marijuana," 10-year-old Michael Collinson said. "It was mostly 
gone," Michael said of the marijuana cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 At Surfers Point in Ventura -- like elsewhere -- cigarette butts were by far 
the most prevalent catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can stand in one spot and not move and pick up butts all day," said Dave 
Herbruck, 45, of Ventura. Herbruck is a member of the Ventura East Optimist 
Club, which adopts Surfers Point each year for the cleanup day. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers Point site captain Dave Erickson, 39, said he was pleased with the 
show of community help this year. "Usually, it's just our club, about 15 
members. But this year we had 45 people. That's encouraging, to see people show 
up on their own," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson received help from his 16-year-old daughter, Christie, and her 
friend, Jessica Huber, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking along the rocky shore, as surfers milked what they could from the 
gentle surf, the duo gathered the usual -- bottles, plastic and the like. But 
Christie also found a rusty, wood-handled knife. She joked of its possible 
connection to a certain recent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, an initially ambivalent Jessica was glad she tagged along for 
the morning. "I wasn't in the mood to wake up at 7, but now I'm glad I came. 
The surfers and everybody were stopping to thank us." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a couple hundred volunteers had preregistered for this year's event, 
Sweet said. However, the workers showed up in force on Saturday, and numbers 
were similar to last year's total of 1,343. 
</P>
<P>
 The only poor turnout was at Mobil Oil Pier Beach where -- besides a Caltrans 
crew -- just one family arrived to collect refuse, Sweet said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was disappointing because that beach is a particularly dirty one," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 6,000 pounds of recyclables were collected. Other trash -- 
headed for the area dumps -- weighed more than 19,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 So is the annual event helping clean things up? 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing definite improvements," said Brier of the California Coastal 
Commission. "The beaches are getting cleaner. The 1993 data shows that 
California beaches have the lowest percentage of plastics on a national level 
and the largest six-year decrease in bottles and associate goods." 
</P>
<P>
 Awareness and education are key. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a lot of work to do inland," she said. "We need to further 
educate people about the importance of keeping our inland waterways clean -- a 
storm drain is an express route right back out to the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Careless litterers need to realize the threat that refuse poses to marine 
animals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just ugly -- but it kills," Brier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trash gets mistaken for food on a constant basis. Plastic food bags can be 
mistaken for jellyfish. Cigarette butts are eaten by birds. It creates the 
notion of being full, and the animals end up starving to death."

ELECTIONS / 35TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; WINERY OWNER AND PROFESSOR FACE OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twelve years ago, Republican candidate Brooks Firestone narrowly lost his bid 
for the state Assembly to Democrat Jack O'Connell. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the Santa Barbara County winery owner will get a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 But he won't face the veteran lawmaker this time. O'Connell is giving up his 
35th Assembly District seat, which covers western Ventura County, to run for 
the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Firestone will face Mindy Lorenz, a college professor and former 
Green Party congressional candidate who surprised political pundits by soundly 
beating Bob Ream, an aide to state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), in the 
Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a classic battle between two very different people with very different 
approaches (to solving problems)," Lorenz said of her matchup with Firestone. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the candidates' personal backgrounds are as different as their 
political views. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz, 47, is a single mother who has gone from living on food stamps to 
earning a doctoral degree and a job as an art history professor at Cal State 
Northridge. The Summerland resident is also a longtime political activist who 
at different times has been a member of the Peace and Freedom Party as well as 
the Green Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of what people like about me is that I have a demonstrated record of 
having the courage of my convictions," Lorenz said. "I'm not afraid to take 
tough stands." 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone, 58, is the grandson of the founder of Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. 
After earning a bachelor's degree in economics from Columbia University in 
1961, he worked in the family business for 11 years, serving two years as 
operations director in Great Britain. In 1972, he moved his family to the Santa 
Ynez Valley where he started his own winery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do business in California, and I'm successful at it," Firestone said. "I 
would do a good job for California." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from their personal backgrounds, the two candidates are also separated 
by their positions on some social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Lorenz opposes the death penalty, while Firestone, who has the 
endorsement of Ventura County's top law enforcement officials, supports it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz said she is not convinced the death penalty deters crime, or that it is 
evenly or justly enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it depends on how much money you have," she said. "All we have to do 
is look at the (O.J. Simpson) case." 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates are pro-choice advocates, but Firestone said he favors a 
waiting period of at least 24 hours and parental consent in cases involving a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that these conditions would be a very reasonable part of the 
(law)," Firestone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates agree that the biggest problem facing California is the 
economy, but argue over who is best qualified to help turn it around. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the stump, Firestone talks up his business experience and managerial skills 
and how he plans to use them to get California's economy rolling again. "It's 
Time to Take Care of Business," reads his campaign slogan, underscoring both 
his determination to set things right and his strong pro-business stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a manager," Firestone said, "and I think California desperately needs 
good management." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz, however, takes a different view of Firestone and his plans for 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brooks is in that camp that says dismantle government, deregulate, hands-off 
and everything will be fine," Lorenz said. "He's a throwback to the 
trickle-down policies that have failed us and that are part of the reason 
California and the country are in the shape they're in." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two, Lorenz said she is the true reformer, someone who believes 
government can play a major role in stimulating the economy by providing 
incentives for development and expansion of small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Firestone, who Lorenz said hails from a background of "wealth and 
privilege," Lorenz said she also understands firsthand the needs of working 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brooks talks about being a business owner who understands what it takes to 
make the economy work," Lorenz said. "I think it is just as important to know 
what it's like to be on the receiving end of a paycheck and understand what 
people are going through with the diminishing job base and a troubled economy." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Firestone has characterized Lorenz in campaign literature as an 
opportunist, "a political candidate looking for a party and a belief." He says 
she was not only a member but a leader and organizer of the Green Party, an 
ecology and social justice movement modeled on the European Greens. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would put her at the outer edge of the liberal spectrum," Firestone 
said, adding, "I don't know what party she agrees with." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican leaders say Firestone represents the best chance they have had in 
years of regaining the 35th Assembly seat, which represents Ventura, Santa 
Paula, Ojai and most of Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats in the district hold a firm lead over registered Republicans -- 
46.7% to 36.9%. But GOP leaders are quick to point out that Republicans 
traditionally tend to go to the polls more often than do Democrats. That trend, 
they say, combined with a possible low turnout at the polls in November, could 
give Firestone the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "With someone who has worked as hard as Firestone and who has the financial 
advantage he does, I'd say he has a very good chance," said Bob Larkin, 
chairman of the Republican Central Committee of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance reports filed at the end of June 30, the last reporting 
period, showed that Firestone had more than $200,000 in the bank, contrasted 
with Lorenz's $1,496. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lorenz said she already has raised several thousand dollars since the 
primary and has a number of fund-raisers planned. Moreover, she said she has 
greater name recognition than Firestone because of her victory over Ream in 
June. Firestone was unchallenged in the Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the advantage," said Lorenz, who spent more than $100,000 in the 
primary. "I've already sent the message out there about who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates are focusing much of their attention on western Ventura 
County, which makes up about 40% of the district and is heavily Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're going to fight it out in Ventura County," said Mary Rose, a 
Democratic political consultant in Santa Barbara. "That's really where they're 
unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the candidates continue to turn up the volume of their attacks on 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 In one campaign flyer, Firestone refers to Lorenz's former membership in the 
Peace and Freedom Party, which supports extending citizenship to every illegal 
immigrant living in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz said she does not support this position, and that it was because of 
such radical views that she left the Peace and Freedom Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had very extreme positions I could not agree with," Lorenz said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same issue, Lorenz accused Firestone of flip-flopping on the Save Our 
State initiative, a statewide ballot measure that calls for the banning of 
public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz said she does not support the measure, but prefers instead to beef up 
border patrols and to enforce laws already on the books against employers who 
hire illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone said he also does not support the ballot measure because it goes 
against federal law. At the same time, however, he said he believes government 
should find some way to stop funding education and health benefits to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big problem, and it's on a lot of people's minds," he said, contending 
public opinion polls show overwhelming support for the SOS initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone said he supports establishing some type of non-discriminatory method 
that would help employers determine the legal status of an employee, but was 
not certain how that could be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone said there is no way to know if he himself had ever hired illegal 
immigrants at his vineyard because there is no system to check an employee's 
Social Security number against his or her's state employment records. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, and particularly for someone in my position, we can't be 
sure," he said. "We tend to hire the same people. We don't hire transients. But 
there is no way to be sure if we have ever hired (illegal immigrants)."

BANDS, BELLIES, QUEENS AND COWBOYS ON THE MARCH IN SIMI; PARADE: THOUSANDS LINE 
UP TO SEE THE TRADITION THAT BEGAN IN THE '30S CONTINUE WITH PLENTY OF 
SMALL-TOWN SPIRIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual Simi Valley Days Parade rolled through the city's streets Saturday 
with its characteristic small-town pomp, bringing out thousands of hardy 
old-timers and energetic newcomers to partake in the picturesque procession. 
</P>
<P>
 Booming marching bands, undulating belly dancers, shuffling square dancers, 
teen-age beauty queens, cowboys -- more than 4,000 parade participants in all 
-- passed down Los Angeles Avenue while thousands of spectators sat curbside 
and cheered along friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 A tradition that began in the 1930s, the parade and annual celebration 
originally were called Pioneer Days, because they involved the city's founding 
families. The event, which has taken place every year since 1962, was renamed 
Simi Valley Days in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen every parade for the last 30 years, since back when it was called 
Pioneer Days," said 56-year-old Dick Kranzler of Simi Valley. "Every year it 
gets a little bit bigger and a little more representative of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Edwards, who has emceed the last 26 parades, agreed that the event 
continues to improve, although he misses the old equestrian entries. He 
imparted witticisms and good cheer as he announced all 158 participants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every parade has its own personality," said Edwards, dressed in a white 
western shirt, "and it all comes alive as they are marching and walking down 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
 For Mary Rhoades, who moved to Simi Valley just four years ago, the parade 
tradition is just beginning. Rhoades, who is this year's chairwoman, said she 
has been involved since she first came to town and saw the colorful floats pass 
by. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, deep down inside I've always been a parade person," Rhoades 
said. "To me, a hometown parade represents the spirit of a community." 
</P>
<P>
 Scooting along in a 1957 T-bird, Irene Runkle-Gates, better known as Miss Simi 
Valley 1933, has been involved in the city's life for most of her 85 years. She 
paraded Saturday along with fellow volunteers from the Simi Valley Hospital, to 
which she has given more than 10,000 hours of volunteer service. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot more comfortable now that we ride in cars instead of horses," 
Runkle-Gates said. "But other than that, it's always been the same."  
</P>
<P>
 Children gawked at the Simi Valley Corvettes as they drove their shiny, 
well-maintained muscle-cars down Los Angeles Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like lying in a traffic jam, driving so slow," said Barbara 
DeMoises in her 1972 Stingray. "I'm sure some of the drivers had to restrain 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Five adults and children from the Simi Valley Boy Scouts sat in a rickety 
seven-foot boat, named "The Stinking Carcass," for the length of the parade. At 
least it had padded seats, they all agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Morr, a rookie Scout, was lucky enough to sit on the trailer in front of 
the boat. Yet the 12-year-old still found something to gripe about. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been behind these belly dancers for a while and it annoys me," Ricky 
said. "We've been hearing their bells and music all day." 
</P>
<P>
 One parade participant suffered minor injuries when he fell off a float and 
his foot was run over by a lightweight trailer, police said. The 7-year-old 
boy, whose name was not disclosed by police, was treated at Simi Valley 
Hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses also joined the parade, looking to publicize their wares.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get the word out about our classes," said Dale Utiger of Simi 
Valley's Happy Squares square-dancing club, which has 120 members. "We need to 
get more people involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Lugging a bass drum around his waist for Oxnard's Hueneme High School marching 
band, John Berry said he felt like he was nine months pregnant.  
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like 90 degrees in these uniforms," said fellow drummer Randall 
Laws. "I'm surprised someone hasn't fainted." 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the gallant efforts of Joe Castro and Bob Seibel, who trailed the band 
pushing five-gallon water jugs, the band was in playing shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just two water boys for Hueneme High," said Seibel, whose daughters, 
Amber and Kelly, were in the school's procession. "But we enjoy ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 At the awards ceremony after the parade, Hueneme looked refreshed, placing 
second to North Park High School in band and first in drill team competition in 
the A class. In the AA Class, Royal High won the band portion, and Camarillo 
High's drill team placed first. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's trophy went to the Corriganville Preservation Committee, a group 
that wants to rebuild the old Corriganville movie set and amusement park, for 
their wild West float that included a saloon, jail and general store. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy Scout Troop 633 won the chairman's trophy; Veterans of Foreign Wars won 
the veterans' prize, and the U.S. Sea Cadets won the color guard award. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful," said Edwards, at the end of another parade. "After 26 years, 
you get to know the people you wave to." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Days ends today with a carnival and rodeo.  
</P>
<P>
 The carnival, at Los Angeles Avenue and Madera Road, starts at noon and runs 
until 10 p.m. Admission is $5 for adults, $4 for seniors and children 4 to 12, 
and free for children under 4. A rodeo, free with carnival admission, will take 
place at 2 p.m.

POWER OUTAGE AFFECTS 3,000 OXNARD HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A power outage in the Channel Islands Harbor area of Oxnard kept more than 
3,000 homes in the dark during the early morning hours Saturday, and left 
another 150 residences without power until 3:30 p.m., a Southern California 
Edison spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The outage occurred about 2 a.m. Saturday when a main cable running through 
the area failed, said John Britton, Edison's area manager.Maintenance crews 
arrived almost immediately, but it took several hours to locate the damaged 
cable, Britton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking miles and miles of cable, and they just have to keep narrowing 
the area down until they find the damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Britton speculated that water somehow seeped into the cable causing it to 
short out, but as of late Saturday the cause of the failure was still under 
investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 The main cable was repaired by 9:30 a.m., but about 150 Edison customers along 
Porpoise Way and Peninsula Road remained without power until the cable leading 
into their area was fixed about 3:30, Britton said.

GOLETA MAN HELD IN CAMARILLO SEXUAL ASSAULTS; CRIME: THE 21-YEAR-OLD IS 
SUSPECTED OF RAPING AND ROBBING TWO FEMALE WORKERS IN A YOGURT SHOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man suspected of raping and robbing two teen-agers working at a Camarillo 
yogurt shop was arrested by Ventura County sheriff's deputies and booked into 
County Jail, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Bass, 21, of Goleta was arrested about 7:15 p.m. Friday as he was 
leaving work at Just Bagels in Agoura Hills, said Lt. Craig Husband of the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass is suspected of sexually assaulting the 17- and 19-year-old females at 
gunpoint during an Aug. 29 robbery of a yogurt shop on Carmen Drive in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims reported being attacked by a masked gunman, who, they said, took 
their clothes and threatened them after the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Because one of the victims saw the suspect before he pulled on a mask, she was 
able to give a detailed description that matched that of a man who robbed as 
many as 14 restaurants and pizza parlors along the Ventura Freeway in Ventura 
and Santa Barbara counties, Husband said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County deputies were assisted by Santa Barbara County sheriff's 
deputies in a two-week investigation that linked the suspect to four robberies 
in the Goleta area and at least three in Thousand Oaks, a Santa Barbara 
Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The break in the case came when detectives from the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department investigating a robbery in Agoura Hills gave Ventura 
County investigators a picture of Bass, Husband said. One of the women was able 
to identify Bass in a photo lineup, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the investigation, more than 30 detectives from the Santa Barbara and 
Ventura county departments conducted surveillance, according to Husband. On 
Friday, investigators said they had enough information to arrest Bass at his 
workplace. Employees at the shop said Bass had been a manager at the shop since 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass was booked into the Ventura County Jail on suspicion of robbery and 
multiple counts of sexual assault, a jail spokesman said. Husband said that 
more than $2,000 in cash was found in a search of his residence, and detectives 
are trying to determine whether the cash can be linked to any of the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail, Husband said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 24TH DISTRICT; GOP STARS GIVE BOOST TO SYBERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican congressional challenger Richard Sybert got a helping hand from GOP 
heavyweights Jack Kemp and William Bennett last week at a fund-raiser that 
grossed $75,000 for Sybert's campaign against Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp and Bennett, both leading lights of the GOP's right wing and possible 
1996 presidential candidates, praised Sybert and attacked Beilenson, President 
Clinton and the Democrat-controlled Congress before about 300 Sybert boosters 
at the Warner Center Hilton Hotel on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, a Woodland Hills attorney and former state planning chief under Gov. 
Pete Wilson, is running hard against Beilenson, who is seeking to hold onto his 
seat representing the 24th Congressional District, which stretches from Newbury 
Park to Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The $150-a-head fund-raiser helped Sybert, 42, top off his campaign war chest 
as his race against Beilenson enters the final seven weeks. According to the 
most recent campaign reports, released in late July, the two men had roughly 
the same amount of cash on hand, with Beilenson reporting $135,852 and Sybert 
$122,759. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, former secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
predicted that Sybert, if elected, would not fall into the trap of excessive 
partisanship that some observers claim has paralyzed the current Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to represent this district and Buffalo, N. Y., and Motown and 
Chi-town and East Harlem because he understands that this is a country that 
cries out for equal opportunity," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Bennett barely mentioned Sybert in his speech. The former federal 
drug czar and secretary of the Department of Education instead attacked the 
"religion of governmentalism," which he said is contributing to the decline of 
morality and family values. JACK CHEEVERS

 An Oxnard man faces up to 11 years in state prison after pleading guilty to 
forcing his 12-year-old brother to sell drugs, prosecutors said.  
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Guadalupe Avitia, 25, has pleaded guilty to inducing a minor to sell 
narcotics, and possession of drugs, the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. set Avitia's sentencing for Oct. 
13. Avitia's girlfriend, Maria Racquel Chavez, 21, faces charges of possessing 
cocaine and heroin and could receive up to five years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old boy was arrested Aug. 4 after police raided the family's 
apartment. The raid was conducted after the boy sold $60 worth of cocaine 
during an undercover sting. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy told police at the time of his arrest that he sold drugs for his 
brother and Chavez. But during a preliminary hearing two weeks later, he 
testified that only his brother instructed him to sell the drugs. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; DEVELOPER STOPS PUMPING OF WETLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After receiving a stop order from a state regulator, a developer that wants to 
build 5,000 houses at Oxnard's Ormond Beach has stopped pumping water out of a 
wetlands area where several endangered species are flourishing. 
</P>
<P>
 California Coastal Commission officials delivered a cease-and-desist order to 
the Baldwin Co. Wednesday, charging that the developer was violating the 
California Coastal Act by pumping water from 30 acres of inundated property 
that have been designated as wetlands for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the order, the Orange County-based homebuilder continued pumping water 
from its property until noon Thursday. The site is where California least terns 
and other endangered wildlife have recently been found in unusually high 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stopped pumping around midday (Thursday) because we basically pumped all 
of the water off of our property," said Louis Malone, president of the company 
division that includes Ventura County. "If our property begins flooding again, 
we may have to start pumping again." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin owner James Baldwin said his company has obtained pumping permits from 
the only agencies that have jurisdiction: the Ventura County Flood Control 
District and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coastal Commission officials say commission permits are required to pump 
water from wetlands, and that Baldwin Co. is flouting environmental law. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Kern, the commission's enforcement analyst, said violations will not be 
taken lightly, and that the state attorney general's office may take action on 
the commission's behalf. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

NEW DRUG COURT SHOWS PROMISE; REHABILITATION: TREATING ADDICTS RATHER THAN 
JAILING THEM SAVES MONEY. ABOUT 100 HAVE ENROLLED IN INTENSIVE YEARLONG 
PROGRAM, BUT FUTURE FUNDING IS UNCERTAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 1:30 on a recent dog-day afternoon and the young woman sitting before 
Judge Stephen Marcus has a sorry story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 She's explaining why she tested positive for drugs, explaining the kinds of 
slings and arrows of life that can send anyone reeling, in her case to get a 
fix. She tells of a return home one evening to discover her lodgings ransacked 
of many things she held dear, including personal mementos, birth certificates 
and the like, handed down by her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge listens impassively but not unsympathetically. Marcus is familiar 
with the woman's history of drug abuse, but has decided she might respond to 
treatment in an innovative new program called Drug Court. As presiding judge of 
the court, he recognizes that relapses are an unfortunate but inevitable part 
of the treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm giving you a free ride," he tells the woman, scrutinizing her records and 
her face, in turn. He could have ordered her to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a promise to return for another progress report in two weeks, the 
woman walks out of the Criminal Courts Building as the judge turns his 
attention to the next case. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people have enrolled in Los Angeles County's Drug Court since it was 
inaugurated three months ago. So far it is receiving mostly favorable reviews 
from prosecutors, defense attorneys, drug treatment specialists and others 
involved in the pilot project. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug Court was designed to offer people arrested for drug possession a way to 
kick their habits and avoid criminal conviction and jail time. The catch is 
that they must agree to an intensive yearlong treatment program, involving 
daily counseling, group sessions, acupuncture, frequent urine tests and close 
monitoring of their progress by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The program represents a new way of thinking about drug users, recognizing 
that simply punishing offenders will not solve long-held addictions. The 
concept is an outgrowth of studies that show that treatment programs are not 
only effective but save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Those findings are borne out in a recent California survey, touted as the most 
comprehensive ever conducted in the United States, that concludes that for 
every dollar spent on treatment for alcohol and drug abuse, taxpayers realize 
$7 in savings, due to reductions in crime and health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the Los Angeles program has won widespread support, capacity is 
limited and it is uncertain if funds will be found to keep it going. Proposals 
to expand the local program and create more Drug Courts are even more tenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerns point up a problem that strikes the broad spectrum of drug 
treatment programs in Los Angeles County: there are simply too few resources to 
meet an overwhelming demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent federal studies indicate that nearly 18% of Californians admit to using 
one or more illicit drugs, while estimates for Los Angeles County are put at a 
minimum of 1 in 10, or about 900,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter of the inmates in Los Angeles County jails are doing time for drug 
possession or sales, and an even higher percentage for other drug-related 
felonies, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The county 
spends about $25,000 a year for every inmate. 
</P>
<P>
 State and county officials estimate the total capacity of the county's public 
and private treatment programs to be 11,000 to 14,000. Of those, the county 
Health Services Department has fewer than 2,000 publicly funded residential 
treatment beds to offer, and they require an average waiting time of 18 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1982, the drug treatment system has become an impoverished community, 
it is malnourished," said M. Douglas Anglin, director of the UCLA Drug Abuse 
Research Center. "The political will to fund drug treatment programs 
disappeared, although that is slowly beginning to turn around." 
</P>
<P>
 Many drug officials are hoping the recently passed crime bill will yield some 
relief. The bill includes provisions for funding drug treatment programs and 
for expanding the growing numbers of Drug Courts cropping up around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our funding comes through federal sources, so we are very hopeful 
this will give us an opportunity to expand our programs; we certainly need 
them," said Wayne Sugita, director of development for county alcohol and drug 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But how much money the county will receive and when it will start flowing into 
the system remain uncertain. Los Angeles County's Drug Court is funded through 
May, but it may take a year to 18 months before federal funds are available to 
keep it going, said Judge Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone is going to have to go to the Board of Supervisors and ask for money 
to tide us over until the crime bill comes through," said Marcus, who estimates 
that the program needs about $250,000 to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the program has money to pay for only three residential treatment 
beds and people who need those services must wait up to three months, said 
Robert G. Espinoza, the Drug Court coordinator for Impact, a Pasadena-based 
program that has been contracted to evaluate prospective participants and 
provide counseling services. 
</P>
<P>
 Detoxification facilities are another component of a successful drug treatment 
program that is in short supply in Los Angeles County, said Espinoza. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only two hospitals in Los Angeles that we can utilize for 
detoxification, and then they have to get on a waiting list, so it's not a real 
option," said Espinoza. "When someone is physically addicted to heroin, I can't 
in good conscience go to the judge and say they are a good risk to put out on 
the street, because they are going to go out and get fixed. We have to ask them 
to stay in jail and kick their habit. A few have agreed to do that, but it's 
hard for them and for me." 
</P>
<P>
 And Marcus said that the third phase of the program, which involves education 
and developing job skills, is still in its formative stages. No one is expected 
to reach that plateau until December, when coordinators hope to have developed 
a comprehensive program. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus would eventually like to see four regional Drug Courts operating with 
2,000 participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug Court officials are realistic about the success rates they are likely to 
achieve. So far, about 25 of the first 100 or so participants have dropped out 
of the program. Those who don't continue must go to trial on the original 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Optimistically, we hope to succeed with about 50% of the participants," said 
Marcus. "And to me success is someone who completes the program and goes a year 
drug-free. The most significant thing about Drug Court is that people don't 
just come with drug problems but . . . also have housing problems, job 
problems, relationship problems." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "In our case we also get a large number who are the hard-core 
unemployed or are transients. So the benefits of having a program like this 
work are enormous for society." 
</P>
<P>
 On another afternoon in Drug Court, a progress report for 26-year-old Freddie 
Balictar brought a smile to the judge's face. Balictar had tested negative for 
the past three weeks, as he has for most of the program with a few relapses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel kind of confident right now," he told the judge. "I've been feeling 
real good." 
</P>
<P>
 Balictar was one of the first to join the program nearly three months ago. It 
has come to dominate his life. He commutes by bus from his Panorama City home 
each morning to the Downtown counseling center and spends most of the day 
there, attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, 
or just hanging out with other participants who share the same problems: the 
emotional baggage of addiction and the continual cravings for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 He quit his job as a salesman because he realized that kicking his cocaine 
habit demanded it. "I stopped working and had to start doing what this program 
wanted me to do," he said, sitting in a spare room at the counseling center a 
few days after the court appearance. He says he is ready to make a change.

NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES ARE NOT ACTING VERY NEIGHBORLY; SAN GABRIEL VALLEY: 
COMMUNITIES PUT UP THEIR FISTS WHEN BORDERS ARE AT STAKE. PROJECTS FROM CARD 
CLUBS TO FREEWAY EXTENSIONS SPUR DISPUTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 El Monte is fighting Arcadia; Diamond Bar and Walnut are duking it out with 
City of Industry. San Gabriel is headed for appeals court, nobody along the 
borders of Pomona is happy, and Alhambra and South Pasadena have had a feud 
going so long, it makes the Hatfields and McCoys look like pikers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tale of many cities, of economic growth versus peace and quiet. It's 
the story of what happens when one city's windfall is in another's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Gabriel Valley, 30 cities are squeezed ever more tightly as the 
population grows -- more than 1.7 million now -- and buffers of empty land are 
eyed for development. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when city coffers are perilously low, the pressure to fill them 
sometimes sparks concern among neighboring residents that new developments will 
crowd them, lower property values, increase crime and traffic or compromise air 
and water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? Tensions. Border disputes. Even lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more of them than there used to be and they are significantly more 
vicious," said Alan Heslop, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna 
College and director of the Rose Institute of State and Local Government. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most volatile of San Gabriel Valley's feuds: 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposals for two card clubs in Pomona prompted four neighboring cities -- 
Claremont, La Verne, Chino and Chino Hills -- and a citizens group to file a 
lawsuit demanding a full environmental impact report. Faced with a court 
battle, Pomona agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Diamond Bar and Walnut banded together to fight a proposed recycling plant 
in a portion of the City of Industry that borders both cities, committing city 
funds to fight the matter in court, and even ferrying residents on chartered 
buses to protests at Industry City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arcadia proposes to place a dump at an abandoned quarry on a remote finger 
of the city, far from Arcadia houses but bordering an El Monte residential 
neighborhood. In May, El Monte filed two suits against the city of Arcadia, one 
of which challenges the proposal's environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residents of the San Gabriel Elementary School District voted two years ago 
to unify the district, build a high school and return San Gabriel students, who 
previously attended high school in Alhambra, to their own city. Alhambra 
challenged the vote in court and won, but San Gabriel appealed. Despite the 
unfinished litigation, the fledgling district will be hosting its first class 
of ninth-graders in temporary quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spanning generations, the conflict over the Long Beach Freeway extension 
began in 1959, when the state proposed an extension that would have split South 
Pasadena in two. Alhambra, which bore the brunt of traffic that spilled from 
the freeway onto surface streets, favored the extension. South Pasadena 
vehemently opposed it. In 1973, a court injunction blocked the project on 
environmental grounds. The stalemate continues to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not the only conflicts, but they typify a trend among cities to step 
into the ring when their borders are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not so much that city borders have changed; they just seem closer than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Increasing population and development has undoubtedly generated more legal 
contest," said Gil Smith, director of government and public affairs for the 
Southern California Assn. of Cities, and a former mayor and founder of the city 
of Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, Heslop said, recession and budget cuts have dried up local 
funds. "Economic pressure is forcing (cities) into activities that are bringing 
them into conflict with their neighboring cities," he said. "What is an 
economic asset for one community -- a card club or a landfill -- can be an 
environmental or a social threat to its neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, makes the neighbors ever more vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'll see more cities join together whenever our quality of life is 
threatened," said Eunice Ulloa, mayor of Chino, one of four cities that filed a 
lawsuit to force Pomona to do more extensive environmental impact reports 
before forging ahead with the card-club proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Time-consuming and expensive, EIRs are the weapon of choice when one group 
wants to challenge another's development. 
</P>
<P>
 EIRs first came into use in the early 1950s, Smith said, as a means of 
challenging highway routes that did not address the worries of affected cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1960s, South Pasadena hired an environmental firm to do an 
assessment on the Long Beach Freeway extension, in preparation for a battle 
over the project's impact, City Manager Ken Farfsing said. In 1970 the 
California Environmental Quality Act mandated the use of EIRs, and in 1973 
South Pasadena sued the Department of Transportation to force them to conduct 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations since then have been a volleyball game in which Caltrans creates 
draft EIRs and South Pasadena bats them back with objections. To date the city 
has reviewed and rejected three draft EIRs, arguing that new concerns have 
surfaced with each draft and old concerns were never addressed. The federal 
Highway Administration, which would provide 85% of the funding, will decide on 
the project at some point in the future.  
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Watson, a municipal attorney whose Los Angeles firm represents 20 cities 
in the L.A. region including South El Monte, said vague environmental standards 
encourage that kind of standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "An EIR is a document that you can't measure with absolute precision," he 
said. "It's easy to attack something as not being adequate if there's no 
precise way to measure adequacy." 
</P>
<P>
 From serving on the battlefront in highway disputes, the EIR became the 
semiautomatic rifle of urban land disputes, used to scatter a wide range of 
accusations against plans seen as threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports now cover the impact on air and water quality, housing, jobs, 
access to public services, transportation problems, infrastructure like roads 
and sewers, and most recently, noise, safety and crime, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in the San Gabriel Valley have so many of those factors dovetailed 
into one conflict than in the fight against the proposed Materials Recovery 
Facility in City of Industry. Nearby residents dread the noise, glare and odor 
they say would be a constant nuisance from the proposed 24-hour-a-day recycling 
and sorting center. They worry about the health impacts of dust and air 
pollution. They fear their property values may be dropping already, as 
prospective buyers grow wary of purchasing homes near what may soon be a trash 
behemoth. And they wonder if roads that join the cities would hold up under the 
strain of more than 1,000 truckloads a day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and officials from Walnut and Diamond Bar took issue with City of 
Industry's preliminary environmental report, saying it failed to look for other 
sites, gave inconsistent statistics on truck traffic, and underestimated the 
noise level involved. Volunteers from both cities gathered 8,000 signatures 
against the project and presented them to the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in a strange twist on a political tactic more often employed by students 
and activists than municipal officials, the two cities jointly organized 
protests. On June 11, 1,500 angry residents bearing picket signs reading "Dump 
the MRF" and "Don't Trash Our City" gathered near the site of the proposed 
facility. On June 23, 200 of them rode buses chartered by the city of Walnut to 
protest at a City Hall hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had to do something very drastic to bring the message to them," 
said Joaquim Lim, director of Walnut's city-sponsored MRF Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill sponsored by Assemblyman Paul Horcher (R-West Covina) that would have 
banned the MRF from within 2,000 feet of homes and forced the three cities to 
negotiate a joint-powers agreement, recently died. Industry officials did not 
return phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Assembly bill, sponsored by Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte), would require 
a joint-powers agreement to resolve the dispute between Arcadia and El Monte 
over the abandoned quarry. The bill has been passed by both houses and sent to 
Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some unique situations where a legislator must intervene, because 
local government isn't doing its job, or the concerns are falling on deaf 
ears," said Josephine Figueroa, a Solis aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Intervening in local conflicts sometimes puts legislators in the untenable 
situation of being asked to resolve a problem, only to be castigated for 
stepping on local authority when they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks the solution to any problem is to throw it up to the state, 
but once the state comes up with a solution, all the local officials are all 
upset, because it's another state mandate," said Ron Brand, Horcher's chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia Mayor Mary Young said she, for one, resents the intrusion. "I think 
each city has the right to try to do what they think is right," she said.

SEPARATING LOVE, ABUSE FOR ASIANS; CULTURE: IMMIGRANTS FIND THAT DISCIPLINARY 
MEASURES CONSIDERED RESPONSIBLE PARENTING IN THEIR HOMELANDS MAY BE IMPROPER IN 
U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The boy had bruises on his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple blotches tracked along his limbs, as though someone had beat the skinny 
8-year-old Vietnamese boy with a belt. 
</P>
<P>
 When social worker Dat Nguyen knocked at the run-down El Monte apartment, the 
boy's parents readily admitted they had hit their son. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a bad boy, the mother said. He fought with schoolchildren who made fun 
of his shabby clothes and poor English. The teacher even sent a note home about 
this misbehavior, which brought much shame onto the family. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents, who immigrated from Vietnam in 1993, were dumbfounded to learn 
they were under investigation for child abuse. They listened as Nguyen 
struggled to explain terms like "excessive discipline" and "foster home" -- 
words that have no equivalents in many Asian societies where extended families 
raise children and government interference is unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love our children, and we suffer with them when we discipline them, but we 
feel that hitting is OK," recalled the father, a former colonel in the South 
Vietnamese army who spent nine years in Communist re-education camps. "I have a 
responsibility to do this, so they will grow up to become good American 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Corporal punishment is accepted discipline in many Asian cultures, but the 
practice is bringing trouble to some immigrants who find that what is 
considered responsible parenting in their native countries can be seen as abuse 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Vietnam and China . . . it's a normal practice to hit a child with a whip 
for bringing home a B," said Frank Nguyen, no relation to Dat, who heads the 
Asian-Pacific Unit of the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
 In Korean, the word teaching, gyopyon, means "teaching with a cane." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that abuse among the Asian community is a massive problem. While 
Asian Americans make up about 11% of the population in Los Angeles County, they 
accounted for only 1.8%, or 1,036 of the 59,414 cases of child abuse and 
neglect investigated in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But some experts believe the number of abuse cases is under-reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study of the issue, titled "Cultural Issues in the Prevention and 
Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect," Frank Nguyen suggests that family 
loyalty and filial piety keep figures low. Also, Asian culture generally calls 
for resolving family problems internally. 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue is not one of high statistics; it's more one of different 
cultural outlooks, which raise provocative questions about the nature of 
discipline, parental authority and the need to protect children while observing 
sensitivity to other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When social workers call on these families, they often find concerned and 
loving parents -- not dysfunctional abusers. It's just that these families are 
used to handling things differently in their homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be very, very sensitive to this issue, because what we think of as 
discipline could be definitely considered abuse in L.A.," said Sookkyung Chang, 
a clinical psychologist who works with Korean families in Rowland Heights and 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our history, if a child does something wrong, the mother will go get tree 
branches and administer 10 lashes on the calves. But she hasn't lost control. 
She's doing it as a punishment and everyone knows. In America, it's a totally 
different culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who work with Asian immigrant families say it's not always clear when 
physical punishment crosses over into child abuse. Often, it depends on one's 
cultural perspective. And therein lies trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are real abuses out there, but there are also a lot of cultural 
misunderstandings," Nguyen said. "To stop using a stick is easy, but what's the 
alternative? They're scared to death they're going to lose control of their 
children. They're scared to death that the police will intervene and come take 
their kid into protective custody." 
</P>
<P>
 To address this cultural confusion, the Asian Youth Center and the Asian 
Pacific Family Center, both in Rosemead, now offer parenting classes in 
Cantonese, Vietnamese, Mandarin and Korean. Private psychologists of Asian 
heritage do a brisk business bridging the gap between conservative old-world 
parents and rebellious Americanized teens. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Department of Children's Services tripled its Asian-Pacific unit, 
based in Covina, from 8 to 24 social workers of Vietnamese, Korean, Laotian, 
Fukien, Cantonese, Samoan and Mandarin heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 With shared roots and a common language, these social workers have more chance 
for success. Aware that direct confrontation is considered rude, they break the 
ice with small talk about their common homeland. So that parents don't lose 
face in front of their children, they ask them to step into another room before 
explaining the purpose of their visit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the issue is easily resolved, a clear-cut cultural misunderstanding 
such as the Southeast Asian practice of coining -- or rubbing a child's back 
with a heated coin -- a common folk remedy for respiratory illness. Coining 
leaves welts that look suspiciously like abuse to teachers unfamiliar with this 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Spankings or beatings put social workers on more murky ground. Under 
California's broadly worded child protection laws, only simple spanking is 
allowed; the use of a belt or a slap to the face, under certain circumstances, 
can be grounds for court intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's Services discourages all spanking. Instead, social workers urge 
parents to set limits and use grounding or loss of privilege as discipline. But 
it can be a hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, Nguyen said a physical education teacher called the child abuse 
hot line after noticing marks on a boy's legs in the shower. When social 
workers arrived at the house, the boy's father threw his hands up and said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I give up, it's too complicated here in America. If you don't want me to 
educate my child, what can I do? You can take the child away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After long talks with the parents of the 8-year-old Vietnamese boy in El 
Monte, Nguyen determined that the boy was not in danger because the family was 
willing to take Nguyen's advice as a Vietnamese elder and try alternate forms 
of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 So one summer afternoon, as the boy crawled happily into his father's lap, 
Nguyen explained the concept of "time out," in which a child is sent off to a 
quiet place to reflect on his misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, social workers provide one-on-one counseling or recommend 
parenting classes that will teach American ways of dealing with children and 
adolescents. In more severe cases, parents are sentenced to attend such classes 
by a dependency court judge as a prerequisite to getting their children back. 
</P>
<P>
 If all else fails -- as with 50 cases last year -- they go to court and ask a 
judge to find the child another home. 
</P>
<P>
 And some parents resent being forced to attend American-style parenting 
classes, according to Josh Lin, a psychologist at the Asian Pacific Family 
Clinic in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel mistreated by the system," Lin said. "They tell me that we need a 
law to protect parents, (that) when they attempt to control their kids, they 
end up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then they tell me: 'Fine, take my child away from the home, I can't do 
anything with him, he won't listen to me.' "

RESIDENTS PROTEST HIRING OF OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some Culver City residents have demanded that the city's Police Department 
rescind its hiring of Timothy Wind, the former Los Angeles police officer who 
was acquitted of state and federal charges stemming from the Rodney G. King 
beating but was dismissed from the LAPD because of his role in it. 
</P>
<P>
 An ad-hoc group told the City Council that the hiring last month of Wind -- 
who is performing mainly clerical duties as an unsworn community service 
officer -- made it appear that the city was insensitive to the issues raised by 
the King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a videotape of the incident at the council's meeting last week, group 
members pointed out Wind's participation and said they were concerned that the 
same thing might happen in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has suggested that the city create a civilian review board to 
oversee decisions made by Police Chief Ted Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind and Cooke have declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Edward Wolkowitz said the fact that Wind was brought to trial was 
not a reason to deny him a job. Wind's dismissal from the LAPD had more to do 
with politics than with his performance, Wolkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Tim Wind was found innocent twice doesn't seem to matter," 
Wolkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Department heads, including the police chief, do not have to consult with the 
council before hiring personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The council signs off on civilian appointments about once a month, and Wind is 
scheduled to be considered in October. The council generally treats the vote as 
a formality, but it could halt an appointment, City Clerk Thomas Crunk said.

L.A. TO BRING RECYCLING OPERATION TO THE WESTSIDE; ENVIRONMENT: OVERBURDENED 
LANDFILLS AND STATE MANDATE TO REDUCE TRASH WILL LIKELY CAUSE MORE RESIDENTS TO 
CHANGE THEIR WAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Wait! don't toss that bottle in the trash. Curbside recycling is about to hit 
most of the Westside, so residents will soon have a nice yellow recycling bin 
to stow it in instead. They will, really. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only a matter of weeks. OK, months, or maybe a year -- it all depends on 
where you live. But the city of Los Angeles is finally bringing the broad, 
garbage-rich swath of territory west of La Brea Avenue into its recycling 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 For residents of some areas this will be nothing new, since they have had 
curbside recycling for years. So have people in Santa Monica, West Hollywood, 
Beverly Hills, Culver City and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the residents of 125,000 Los Angeles homes who are about to be 
included in the city's newly expanded recycling district, that environmentally 
responsible feeling is finally at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to hear it because a lot of people tend not to bother," said Jim 
Witoszynski, a West Los Angeles resident who takes his recyclables to a 
drop-off station in Santa Monica once or twice a week. "So if they just have to 
put it in front of their house, then it's easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials of Los Angeles and other Westside municipalities say they 
expect to meet or surpass a state-mandated goal of a 25% cut in the flow of 
solid waste by next year, the bad news is that another 25% in garbage savings 
will have to be achieved by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting to 50% is the hard part," said Joan Edwards, director of the 
Integrated Solid Waste Management Office, which coordinates Los Angeles' 
recycling programs. The city of Los Angeles has already surpassed the 25% mark, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only so much that individuals can do. Only about 15% of the trash 
from an average household can be recycled, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Any surplus of recyclables goes straight into a hole in the ground, and with 
landfills running out of room, it is unclear how much longer that will remain 
an option. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez Canyon, the landfill that serves the city of Los Angeles, is scheduled 
to close in 1996, although sanitation officials are trying to keep it open for 
another three years despite the opposition of residents in the northeast San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said extending its life to the year 2000 would save the city $72 
million over the cost of hauling the trash elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may be putting out less trash per person, but there are more people," 
said Bill George, recycling coordinator for the Los Angeles County Sanitation 
Districts. "We don't see this problem going away." 
</P>
<P>
 So any further improvement will have to come from mass changes of behavior 
summed up in the first two words of the state Integrated Waste Management 
Board's "Three R's" slogan: "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle." In short, a farewell to 
the throwaway society.  
</P>
<P>
 Change will not come easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the popularity of recycling and the downturn in the Southern 
California economy, "we're still getting a lot of trash because we are still 
pretty much a disposable society," said Kimberly Collins, project manager for 
Malibu's Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Research has found that Americans create more waste than any other nation, 
averaging half a ton per person per year -- 3.5 pounds per day. Californians 
are said to be generating more than twice as much as the average. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real secret is the next generation," said Joan Satt, waste-reduction 
coordinator for Culver City. She cited the case of a man who called to ask 
about recycling after his 4-year-old daughter came home from preschool talking 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as parents stopped smoking when their children pressured them into it 
because they learned in school that tobacco kills, so, too, will the children 
lead us into less wasteful ways," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until those tykes grow up, however, it will be up to the rest of us to find a 
way to come to terms with the problems of waste in a land of abundance. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Westside, cities have found their own paths, and now Los Angeles is 
about to take major strides to step up its recycling program after a two-year 
delay caused by problems with staffing, equipment and finding a site for a 
sorting station, known in the trade as a Materials Recovery Facility, or MRF. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, most of the area's recyclables will go to a plant in an industrial 
zone near Downtown and the rest will go to a facility in the West Valley. That 
led Valley Councilwoman Laura Chick to voice concerns earlier this year about 
air pollution from 150 truckloads a week of Westside waste. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, officials said that they are negotiating with several operators 
to find one that would run a Westside MRF to be located in an industrial area 
near Robertson and Venice boulevards in Palms. Officials hope the plant will be 
operating by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the latest expansion of curbside recycling is completed sometime next 
summer, the service will be available to 720,000 residences and businesses 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, paper accounts for the biggest share -- about 30% -- of the 
waste stream, followed by yard scraps at 13%, food waste 11%, plastics 7%, and 
other categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Most apartment buildings are served by private trash haulers, so they will not 
be part of the program; those served by the city's garbage trucks will be 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the residential program is expanded, each household will be issued a yellow 
14-gallon bin for recycling everything but paper -- metal and aluminum cans, 
glass bottles and jars and plastic bottles. For now, no milk cartons and no 
tubs such as those used for cottage cheese and margarine will be collected 
because they are too expensive to recycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will be asked to put discards such as magazines, newspapers, 
corrugated cardboard or paper bags next to the yellow bins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens on the same day as the regular trash collection, so there's 
nothing you have to remember except to put it out," said Gyl Elliott, public 
information director for the city Bureau of Sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation officials said they have received hundreds of calls from residents 
concerned about scavengers. Earlier this month, the Board of Public Works 
approved a proposal to form a three-member team to crack down on organized 
rings that routinely raid the yellow bins. The proposal now goes before the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 A law makes scavenging a misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine or six months 
in jail, but authorities said they didn't know if anyone had ever been 
prosecuted under it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not so much the loss of recyclables that bothers city officials as the 
fear that residents will not bother with recycling if they see the proceeds 
going into private hands. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be 60-gallon green containers for garden waste, which is composted, 
mixed with sewer sludge and sold as fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 The third container will be a 60-gallon black container whose contents go to 
the dump; it holds the equivalent of three or four regular trash cans -- 
probably too much for many households. 
</P>
<P>
 "They determined in 1988 that that was the average size needed, but what they 
didn't realize was how much we'd be recycling by now," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The trash flow from the West Valley, for example, is already down 40% from 
what it was in 1990, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We challenge the West Los Angeles area to go even higher," Elliott said. 
"It's reasonable because people have been waiting for it for years, and the 
only reason we didn't go there was because there was no place to take the 
material." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the initial solid-waste reduction was measured at no more than 3% 
when the program began elsewhere in the city five years ago, Elliott said the 
inclusion of garden waste has made a big difference, representing almost a 
third of what the average person puts out a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts by Los Angeles and other local municipalities are part of a statewide 
drive that has reduced solid waste by 20% since 1990.

MIKE PENNER: THIS VICTORY WAS YEARS IN MAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Returning to action after 620 consecutive bye weeks, the Chapman University 
Panthers played their first intercollegiate football game since 1932 Saturday 
night and won, rather easily, 30-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they were well-rested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers scored on their first offensive possession in 62 years, completed 
the first five forward passes they attempted since the Hoover Administration 
and rolled up 440 yards in total offense under the lights for the first time 
since . . . well, the Panthers had only one light the last time they played a 
football game. The one that rises in the east and sets in the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other 62-year firsts for Chapman football: 
</P>
<P>
 -- First play on offense: Fullback Aaron Meschuk, up the middle for two yards 
and a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sort of nervous," Meschuk confessed. "My hands got more sweaty than 
they already were. But I hit the hole, hung onto the ball and got a few yards. 
I felt like asking them to stop the game and take that ball out of play." 
</P>
<P>
 -- First touchdown: Precision 12-yard lob to wide receiver Dave Poltl deep in 
the left corner of the end zone, delivered by quarterback Curtis Robinson, 
whose right shoulder, the one he throws with, happened to be separated at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hurt it the second play of the game," said Robinson, sporting the telltale 
ice bag and shoulder wrap from beneath a gray flannel blanket. "The coaches 
asked me if I wanted to come out then. I told them I didn't want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Any particular reason why not? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of history," Robinson said. "What else can you say?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- First postgame victory speech: Panther Coach Ken Visser, who first saw this 
group of players only three weeks ago, ordered them to huddle up at midfield 
while the losing Whitter Poets straggled back to the showers, heads hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congratulations, men," Visser said, setting his jaw as he gestured toward the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's forever," he said. "Thirty-to-thirteen. That's forever." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a refrain Visser had prepared them for during the past few days, 
attempting to focus 86 players recruited from wildly varying backgrounds and 
circumstances on the moment at hand -- a once-in-three-generations kind of 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "All week, he kept telling us, '62 years! 62 years! This is going to be the 
first time in the record book!' " Meschuk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Visser wanted to make sure it would be worth reading 62 years down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of tradition, Visser was up against it. Whittier, which once suited 
up an offensive lineman named Richard Nixon, has been fielding football teams 
annually since 1907. Chapman didn't have a football coach, player or trainer 10 
months ago. Visser was hired last December, recruiting commenced soon after but 
the Panthers didn't begin practicing in pads until Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Visser, however, did not flinch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, we didn't have a lot of time, but I'm at a school located in the middle 
of a rich football area," Visser said. "Chapman's the only four-year university 
playing football in Orange County right now. I had a lot of good kids to choose 
from locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our staff has worked real hard, but things just kind of fell into place. I'm 
just lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it all fell into place, just as soon as Visser and athletic director 
Dave Currey could find enough shoulder pads to complete a full practice. It can 
be a problem, having 113 hopefuls turn out for the first day of workouts and 
only 90 sets of shoulder pads to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Andersen, former Chapman associate athletic director and longtime friend 
of Currey's, laughed and shook his head at the thought of such a predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave did a great job," Andersen said. "He really hustled to find those 
shoulder pads. I suggested he go to the Rams for some help. They haven't been 
using their shoulder pads much this year. They had to have some available." 
</P>
<P>
 These are the thrift-shop Chapman Panthers, all the way down to their plain 
black helmets, plain white jerseys and plain gray pants, with not a logo or a 
pant stripe in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, each of those stripes cost $2.20," said Currey, who was allotted just 
$200,000 to exhume Chapman football after six-plus decades -- and keep it in 
the black, if you can. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we needed were numbers, pants, shoes and socks," Currey said. "This is as 
vanilla as you're going to get. But when I coached, I lost to Penn State often 
enough to know that fancy uniforms aren't what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 To Currey's eyes, an undefeated Panther football team with 500 roaring 
boosters waving red foam-rubber No. 1 fingers -- these, too, arrived just 
minutes before kickoff -- was a piece of art. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was kind of like a wedding," Currey said, staring at the pretty numbers 
on the scoreboard. "You're relieved. All the in-laws got along." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Andersen, currently the executive director of the Orange County Sports 
Assn., smiled and quipped, "Now you know why I'm here. I'm scouting Chapman for 
the Freedom Bowl."

JIM MURRAY: GREATEST HAPPENING SINCE BABE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's probably too early for it, but I have a candidate for Sports 
Illustrated's sportsman of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, I know he hasn't dunked a basketball in earnest in almost a couple of 
years. I know that Dream Team II didn't include him. He's probably had a dip in 
shoe sales and soft-drink peddling. But let me tell you what he did do. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave the game of baseball a shot in the arm. Oh, I don't care that he 
batted . 203 or whatever it was. For a minor league team, at that.  
</P>
<P>
 But consider what this man did for the grand old game: Amid a storm of 
derision, hooting, catcalls and assorted expressions of scorn, he left a sport 
at which he was not only dominant but all-time.  
</P>
<P>
 And what did he leave it for? A villa in the south of France? A yacht trip to 
the Bahamas. A life of ease on the golf course? 
</P>
<P>
 Nah! He left it to try out for the Chicago White Sox but cheerfully accepted 
assignment with the Birmingham Barons. A double-A baseball team. A farm club.  
</P>
<P>
 He did it, he said, because he loved baseball. He was fulfilling a dream.  
</P>
<P>
 Think about that for a minute. A guy who was the greatest basketball player 
ever to play the game chucks it all to go try to hit the curveball. He went 
from a ball 30 inches in circumference to one 9 inches. He went from prime time 
to blackout.  
</P>
<P>
 You remember how they used to say a certain player -- Willie Mays comes to 
mind -- would play the game for nothing? Well, Michael Jordan damn near did. 
</P>
<P>
 He went from a sport of the 21st Century to one of the 19th. They said 
baseball was too old, too slow, too quaint. But here was this legendary 
sportsman ready to suit up with the no-illusion veterans, the starry-eyed kids, 
to make the long bus trips to metropolises like Greenville, Knoxville, 
Huntsville, Chattanooga and Memphis and do it joyously.  
</P>
<P>
 He opted for the indigenous American sport when he was the toast of six 
continents in a sport recognized everywhere, even in places where they don't 
know who Mickey Mantle is.  
</P>
<P>
 I have never wanted anyone to succeed more than I did Michael Jordan. He did 
more for the esteem of baseball than anyone since Babe Ruth saved it from the 
Black Sox.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, there are the other candidates. Choose one: Bud Selig, Richard Ravitch, 
Donald Fehr.  
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to figure who's done less for baseball under the guise of helping 
it, indeed, saving it.  
</P>
<P>
 How do these guys qualify for sportsman of the year? Well, bear in mind the 
contributions don't always have to be positive. Hitler and Stalin made Time 
magazine's man of the year, if memory serves. Your impact on history can be 
apocalyptic.  
</P>
<P>
 So, these guys eminently qualify. Serial killers occupy a better place in the 
minds of sports fans than a guy who kills baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 No World Series? No pennants? What's next? No Indy 500? No Kentucky Derby? The 
Super Bowl is too new to qualify. After all, the next one will be Super Bowl 
XXIX. The next World Series would have been World Series XCI.  
</P>
<P>
 Who honors baseball? Michael Jordan tossing aside the adulation of the 
multitudes to risk humiliation, failure? Or the cleanup hitters of the counting 
house, the MVPs of bookkeeping who padlocked an American institution after they 
let their labor loot it.  
</P>
<P>
 Who says baseball is their private toy anyway? A yacht berthed at St. Tropez, 
a Bugatti in the garage, a stamp collection? 
</P>
<P>
 The minute these guys sewed a community's label on the front of their team's 
uniforms -- and there's no evidence they ever asked the community's permission 
-- they entered into an implied contract with that community.  
</P>
<P>
 This was not like owning a Mom & Pop store on Firestone Boulevard. You owned a 
municipal project, a public trust. These guys draw support, sustenance from 
that community identification, indeed their very existence depends on it. If 
you don't think so, just go down to an anonymous sandlot game where the 
principals play in a blank uniform for the fun of it and count the crowd and 
look for the television cameras. It won't take long.  
</P>
<P>
 The men who run baseball have run it over a cliff. These Solomons have really 
cut the baby in half. These guys for whom the communities not only lent their 
name and their loyalties but also built them magnificent edifices to showcase 
their product, have broken faith with those communities, with the people who 
made them, nurtured them, made them a part of the municipal family, so to 
speak.  
</P>
<P>
 The communities should now entertain bids from other entrepreneurs who will 
not only pay for the privilege of representing the communities but guarantee 
they will perform, not forfeit a season. If you hire a blimp or a skywriter or 
even a balloon to advertise and promote your city, it has to fly.  
</P>
<P>
 A team has a higher obligation to the community it purports to represent than 
to fold its tent in a union squabble. Otherwise, what you have is the Bingo 
Long Traveling All-Stars. Or the House of David. Are they the Milwaukee 
Brewers? Or the Bud Selig & Co. Brewers? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not an ordinary business. Otherwise, wouldn't the so-called imperiled 
"small-market" teams simply move into the big markets? Go where the money is? 
Didn't Macy's move across the street, so to speak, from Gimbel's? The May 
Company from the Broadway? Pittsburgh's losing money? OK, move to New York 
where there's lots more.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they can't. New York won't stop them. "Baseball" will. Standard Oil 
can open a gas station where it wishes. Baseball can't.  
</P>
<P>
 So, a community that could look forward to revenue from a playoff or World 
Series crowd is dark. The game is dark. The outlook is dark.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dark Sox. Tell me, who has hurt the game of baseball worse -- the 1919 
Chicago Black Sox? Or the 1994 lineup of Selig, Ravitch and Fehr? The 
commissioner -- Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis -- brought us out of that 1919 
shame. The commissioner now is part of the problem.  
</P>
<P>
 So, let's hear it for Michael Jordan. The only guy in it who showed he really 
loved the game for itself.

CHAVEZ STOPS TAYLOR IN THE EIGHTH ROUND; BOXING: HE SCORES A TECHNICAL KNOCKOUT 
AT 1:41 TO RETAIN HIS WBC SUPER-LIGHTWEIGHT TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Once again, Meldrick Taylor's heart and handspeed brought out the best in 
Julio Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Taylor fought Chavez toe to toe, but, four years after their 
first, controversial bout, once again Taylor ended the fight with the referee's 
arms around him and Chavez's arms raised high in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 After Chavez piled up the punishment in the middle rounds, a sharp left 
uppercut in the eighth round caught Taylor square on the chin, sending him 
backward across the ring and then flat on his back Saturday night before 15,222 
at the MGM Grand Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor got up quickly but was obviously still groggy when Chavez leaped to 
finish him off. Five or six heavy shots later, with Taylor's arms dangling at 
his side, referee Mills Lane stepped between the two and ended the fight at 
1:41 of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fight, Chavez, who retained his World Boxing Council 
junior-welterweight title, said the victory was an answer to all the doubts 
that had built up about him after dubious decisions in fights with Pernell 
Whitaker and Frankie Randall and a loss to Randall. 
</P>
<P>
 His promoter, Don King, announced that Randall, who won the World Boxing Assn. 
junior-welterweight title earlier in the evening, will fight Whitaker, the WBC 
welterweight champion, at an undetermined date. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner, King said, will fight Chavez (91-1-1, 78 knockouts). 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, this is my revenge," Chavez said through an interpreter. "For 
everyone who said that I was done and that Don King would fall, this is our 
revenge. I knew that I would win this fight, I was so dedicated. Now, I want 
Randall." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Taylor controlled Chavez through 11 1/2 rounds but was knocked 
down by a right to the chin in the last 15 seconds. Referee Richard Steele 
halted the bout with only two seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Taylor (32-4-1) did not disagree with the stoppage, although two of 
the three judges scored the fight even through the sixth despite two points 
deducted from Taylor for low blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Early, Taylor duplicated his first-fight performance with quick hooks to 
Chavez's face. But, as in the first fight, he was cut inside his mouth in the 
third or fourth. By the fourth, Chavez appeared to be rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt strong, obviously, until I got hurt," Taylor said. "I thought I had 
him hurt a couple of times, but he's a great champion and I take my hat off to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight began tentatively, the two fighters' circling each other, but by the 
middle of the first round, Taylor and Chavez began exchanging heavy shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the early rounds, Chavez appeared wary of Taylor's handspeed and 
avoided launching an all-out frontal attack. Meanwhile, Taylor landed lefts and 
rights to Chavez's face while moving side to side. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor was penalized a point in the third for a low shot after several 
warnings by Lane, then Chavez moved in and scored with several hard blows to 
the face and body as the bell sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 By the fourth, both men were making mocking gestures at each other. Taylor 
instigated the pro-Chavez audience by falling to the canvas in the last minute 
after a lunging Chavez right hand, but it was ruled a slip. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez scored with hooks in the fifth, but Taylor was not shaken. Then, with 
less than a minute remaining in the round, Taylor answered with several shots 
of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 A very low Taylor uppercut opened the sixth, which was Chavez's most 
impressive round in more than a year. Taylor was penalized another point for 
the low blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez appeared angered by the shot, coming straight at Taylor from then on, 
and Taylor hit the canvas in another heavy slip. 
</P>
<P>
 A minute after the initial flurry, a straight right to the chin rocked Taylor 
on his heels, sending blood pouring out of his mouth. In their first fight, 
Taylor had to go to the hospital after swallowing a pint of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty seconds later, another right wobbled Taylor again and the round ended 
with the crowd roaring in anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in a long time, Chavez did not disappoint them.

NO TEARS FOR FEARS; ALZHEIMER'S SYMPTOMS STRIP MEMORIES FROM FORMER RAM GREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is not a life that should be forgotten. It has been, until now, a 71-year 
highlight film that, for those who don't know the man, plays out suspiciously 
like some Faustian joy ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, in a cruel conclusion, Tom Fears has been called to "accounts 
payable." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe no one gets what he was handed and walks away clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe no one deserves to have been so happy. Maybe, ultimately, no one so 
blessed should be allowed to remember that he caught touchdown passes from Bob 
Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin on Sundays at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe such a fortunate son should not be allowed to boast about being so good 
that -- on a team that included "Crazylegs," "Deacon Dan" and "Night Train" -- 
no one saw a need to give him a nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he should not be allowed to reflect, as the Rams warm up the moving 
vans, that his name might soon become indelibly etched in history as the man 
who crossed into an end zone in 1951 and hand-delivered the Los Angeles Rams 
their only NFL championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that, as an assistant coach in 1961, he strode into Green Bay, Wis., around 
the time Coach Vince Lombardi was reshaping football with his block of stone 
and chisel. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that, in 1970, he took another walk into Canton and the NFL Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that, in 1951, he married Luella Wintheiser, a pretty, common-sense woman 
of German decent, and hasn't looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that she bore six children, three of each gender -- "a balanced attack," 
Fears likes to say -- who in turn have borne six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 How many of us get to say, "If I had to do it all over again, I'd do it the 
same way." 
</P>
<P>
 How many look back with no regrets? 
</P>
<P>
 "I thank my lucky stars," Fears says. "I've had the best of everything. My 
wife is the greatest lady I've ever met. I say that unequivocally." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was for Fears to live out his golden years with all these wonderful 
memories. In 1988, he and Luella moved from Orange County to an upscale 
townhouse in Palm Desert. Their back porch overlooks the 16th fairway of the 
gated-community course. Fears took up golf later in life and figured he had a 
lot of catching up to do. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing wrong with Fears that meets the eye. He keeps himself in 
splendid physical condition, shaves the fat from his meat, watches his 
cholesterol, works out at the gym. Fears, in fact, weighs seven pounds less 
than he did when he was protecting his knees from the likes of Philadelphia 
Eagle linebacker Chuck Bednarik, the NFL hit man of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears can be expected to live in good health for years, which might turn out 
to be another cruel twist. 
</P>
<P>
 He noticed something was wrong about six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to have at least an average memory," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, then rapidly, Fears began to forget things. It was as though a 
computer virus had invaded his brain and deleted microchips. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd be reading a paper and say, 'I don't know why I'm reading this because I 
don't know what I just read,' " Luella says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears first thought memory loss came with the territory at his age. 
</P>
<P>
 But the condition quickly worsened. One day, Fears sat alone in his car, 
dumbfounded, unable to remove the keys from his ignition. He'd forgotten he 
needed to press a button to release them. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu taped instructions to the dashboard: "To take keys out of the ignition, 
push this button." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer, while their home was being remodeled, Tom and Lu moved 
temporarily into a Palm Springs condominium. Making the routine drive back home 
to play golf, a route Fears knew as well as any down-and-out pattern he ever 
ran, he got lost in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 The family, scared, took the keys out of his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could be driving and forget where the brakes are," Lu said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next drive was to the doctor. A magnetic resonance imaging test revealed 
Fears had suffered some loss of brain cells that could not be regenerated. 
</P>
<P>
 As owner of three Orange County board and care homes in the 1970s, Lu Fears 
had been down this road before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had Alzheimer's in my homes," she said. "I know how they act." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu did not need the Mayo Clinic Family Health Book to recite, chapter and 
verse, the signs and symptoms of the disease first described in 1906 by Alois 
Alzheimer, a German neurologist: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gradual loss of memory for recent events and inability to learn new 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Growing tendency to repeat oneself, misplace objects, become confused, and 
get lost. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Slow disintegration of personality, judgment and social graces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increasing irritability, anxiety, depression, confusion and restlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Alzheimer's afflicts at least 2.5 million Americans, most over 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu Fears had watched this most common form of dementia, for which there is no 
cure, reduce loved ones to invalids and tear families apart. 
</P>
<P>
 A family friend, Dan Fortmann, a former Chicago Bear star and Ram physician in 
the 1950s, wasted away from Alzheimer's and ended up in a convalescent home, 
unable to recognize his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very glad I had the boarding houses," Lu Fears says. "I learned a lot. I 
know what to expect. This (Tom's case) is nothing compared to what I had. I had 
some fifth stage, people who couldn't put sentences together." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu Fears also is aware that early symptoms of Alzheimer's can turn out to be 
treatable forms of dementia. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Fears has resigned himself to the worst-case scenario. Recently, speaking 
to Orange County sportswriters -- he and 13 other former Rams will be honored 
at today's game against the 49ers -- he disclosed that he had Alzheimer's, even 
though the condition still has not officially been diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have it," Fears says. "You always have hope. But I'm not depending 
or banking on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu Fears exhausts all other possibilities. Diagnosing Alzheimer's is a process 
of elimination. Similar symptoms can occur because of other factors, such as 
hypothyroidism, depression, adverse reaction to medication or a vitamin B12 
deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears has undergone blood work and awaits the results. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Lu and her children pore through medical journals and diet 
books in the hopes of somehow stemming Tom's memory regression. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears already has been prescribed medication for his increased irritability 
and uncharacteristic bursts of temper, symptoms common to Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is taking a drug called hydergine, which some believe might be able to 
reverse existing damage to brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all we can do, try these things and see," Lu says. "If we can just 
control it, so it doesn't get any worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Fears goes about his daily activities, wondering what tomorrow will bring. 
</P>
<P>
 "When does it stop?" he asks. "How (much) worse does it get? That's the 
scariest part. You know there are Alzheimer's (patients) that are in homes, 
that have to have everything done for them. I hope I don't reach that point. I 
don't think I will, but God knows." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 71-year-old man bites into a breaded jumbo shrimp at a Mexican restaurant 
near his home and wonders how long he will remember he is Tom Fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Over dinner, he repeatedly asks the name of his waiter, Luis, who kindly 
obliges each request. Fears confesses he had to repeat the name of a visiting 
reporter all day to keep it fresh in his mind. He maintains a daily notebook to 
keep him abreast of the day's itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know in the last six months my memory has been slipping," Fears says. "Your 
neighbors, unless you see them regularly, you forget their names. It's 
embarrassing. That's the worst part. It's embarrassing. People think that you 
don't give a damn about them, but that's not the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 At NFL Alumni golfing functions, Fears has drawn blanks when coming across 
players he played with or coached. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, the 1950s are clearer to him than the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the hell I did yesterday," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu says her husband's memory begins to leave him on events in the last 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsure how fast his memory will recede, Fears races time as he attempts to 
reconstruct his life over shrimp and drinks. He becomes increasingly frustrated 
when he cannot remember the basic chronology of his career. Where did he go in 
1970, after being fired as the first coach of the New Orleans Saints? 
</P>
<P>
 Damn, was it Philadelphia? 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things that are normal things, things that I should know just like 
that," Fears says, snapping his finger to punctuate the point. "I've seen this 
progression and it's very, very tough. When will it completely go out? 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my kids of course. I have six kids and six grandchildren. But one of 
my grandchildren, I can never remember her name. I'll look at it, write it down 
a hundred times. Then I think I've got it. Then I'm sitting right here, and I 
can't remember her name. It scares the hell out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the prospect of not knowing you are Thomas Jesse Fears, son of a 
mining engineer father and a Mexican mother. 
</P>
<P>
 That you grew up in Los Angeles in a two-bedroom house near 38th and Western. 
That before you were a football star at the Coliseum, you were an usher there, 
earning 50 cents a day. 
</P>
<P>
 That you idolized your only sibling, Chuck, 3 1/2 years older. That it was 
Chuck who first starred at Manuel Arts High and then UCLA, Chuck who anchored 
the Bruin team that went to the 1943 Rose Bowl, Chuck who became a successful 
electrical engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 That your life, as were many, was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. 
That, early on, your father, Charles Sr., was captured by the Japanese in the 
Philippines and wasn't liberated until 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kicked the crap out of him," Fears says. "He wasn't the same man when he 
came back." 
</P>
<P>
 That you joined the armed services hoping to fight the Japanese as a fighter 
pilot, but after earning your wings, you were stationed in Colorado Springs to 
play football for the 2nd Air Force Superbombers. And although you wanted to 
fight, you concede the assignment "probably saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine not remembering that the Cleveland Rams drafted you in the 12th round 
in 1945, but you had made a commitment to attend UCLA, where you played two 
years. The Rams, it turned out, moved to Los Angeles in 1946 and waited for you 
to finish up a cozy college ride that included perks from campus "sugar 
daddies" and bit parts in Hollywood movies. 
</P>
<P>
 That, while with the Rams, you teamed with Elroy (Crazylegs) Hirsch to become 
one of the greatest receiving duos of all time. That, in a nine-year career, 
you led the NFL in receptions three times, including your rookie season of 
1948, when you caught 55 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 That your team played in NFL championship games in 1949, 1950 and 1951. That, 
after losing the first two, to Philadelphia and Cleveland, your Rams won their 
only Los Angeles championship in 1951, avenging a loss to the Browns the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 That Los Angeles had a champion because of you. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score 17-17 in the fourth quarter, quarterback Van Brocklin's 
game-winning pass landed in your hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a 73-yarder," Fears recalls distinctly. "How in the hell can I 
forget that. If I forget that, then everything's gone, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine not being able to remember your glory years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really were," Fears says. "Everywhere we went we were heralded. It was 
great. Everybody likes attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Or how humble you were, saying your greatness was a reflection of having 
played with two of the game's greatest quarterbacks, Van Brocklin and 
Waterfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get together at NFL golf parties, someone from Cleveland will say 
that (Brown quarterback) Otto Graham was the greatest," Fears says. "And you 
can't argue. But unquestionably, when you tell them we had the two greatest who 
ever played on one team, they'd have to admit it." 
</P>
<P>
 That you thought Van Brocklin was a better passer than Waterfield, but that 
the comparison ended there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waterfield was by far the best athlete," Fears says. "He could run the ball, 
hand off, hide it better, and play defense too. We had players from all over -- 
Florida, Carolina, Green Bay -- and nobody ever had seen an athlete like Bob 
Waterfield." 
</P>
<P>
 That you weren't too shabby yourself, leading the Rams in receptions five 
times. Against the Green Bay Packers in 1950, you caught 18 passes, still the 
NFL single-game record. 
</P>
<P>
 That in 1950 you met a girl named Luella, from Minneapolis, who came to Los 
Angeles on a month's vacation and extended the stay 43 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That you weren't as flashy as Crazylegs, but had great instincts and fly-paper 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fabulous, a great, great receiver," recalls Ram executive Jack Faulkner, who 
was a Ram assistant coach during Fears' career. "He didn't have the great speed 
you see these guys have today, but he could make you miss, had very quick hands 
and great vision. He was phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 That your team records stood for years until Henry Ellard came along. In 1988, 
with his 86 catches, Ellard broke your team record of 84, set in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ellard closed in on the mark, he had to pass, daily, the picture of you 
that hangs on the wall of the team cafeteria, yet Ellard, remarkably, had no 
idea who you were. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine forgetting that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team puts out (record) books, you know," Fears says. "He should have seen 
it in the records. I sure as hell knew who the great ones in front of me were. 
It's a different era." 
</P>
<P>
 Or that after retiring in 1956, you became an astute businessman and assistant 
coach. You invested in taco stands and made out well. In 1960, you joined 
Waterfield's staff as a Ram assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 That in 1961, you became receiver coach for the Green Bay Packers the season 
the team won its first of five NFL championships under Lombardi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything they say about him was true," Fears says of the legendary coach. 
"He was a smart guy, and a hard worker. He was a Catholic, a daily communicant. 
He went to church every day. That's really something, especially for a guy who 
would coach the rest of the day and into the night." 
</P>
<P>
 That you got your break in 1967 when the expansion New Orleans Saints named 
you as the franchise's first coach. In the opener, your John Gilliam ran back 
the opening kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't get the people off the field," recalls Faulkner, an assistant to 
Fears on that first Saint team. "They thought the game was over. It was 
fabulous. Al Hirt was playing the horn, the fans were down there dancing with 
their umbrellas." 
</P>
<P>
 That reality soon set in. That you got fired eight games into the 1970 season 
after posting a four-year mark of 13-34-2. 
</P>
<P>
 That you re-emerged in 1975 to coach the Southern California Sun of the World 
Football League. But the tent folded after two seasons. And that, in the 1980s, 
you were a front-office man in another short-lived venture, the Los Angeles 
Express of the United States Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine forgetting all that.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stretched out on his living-room recliner, watching the TV for as long as he 
can stand it, Fears coaches and curses the Rams through a horrible exhibition 
performance against the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the kitchen, within earshot, Luella Fears sips coffee and works on her game 
plan to halt her husband's memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, she took Fears to a clinic that offers experimental treatment for 
Alzheimer's. There, Fears was tested and determined to be an Alzheimer's 
candidate, but the family ultimately decided against the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have time for something to be tested, then wait years for the FDA to 
approve something years from now," Luella says. "We hope we can arrest it at 
this stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Fears has no history of Alzheimer's in his immediate family, yet doctors are 
running out of tests. 
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps perversely fitting that, as the Rams make plans to move and 
become a memory after 48 years in town, the player who perhaps best embodies a 
Los Angeles Ram -- Tom Fears -- may ultimately be shielded from remembering the 
exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saddened by it," Fears says of the potential Rams' move. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, Fears tends to remember only the good times, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The 73-yard pass from Van Brocklin. How in the hell could I forget that? 
</P>
<P>
 In case the lights continue to fade, Fears wants everyone to know he remembers 
his life as a love story, not a sob story. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sickness, and when you've been diagnosed with such, people feel 
sorry for you," Fears says. "I don't think I should be felt sorry for." Tom

RAMS' ONLY HOPE: A THROWBACK; PRO FOOTBALL: GOING BY TODAY'S STANDARDS, THEY 
DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE AGAINST THE 49ERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's "Throwback Weekend" in the NFL, and while this isn't what the Park Avenue 
marketing folks had in mind, you have to go all the way back to 1986 to mark 
the last time the Rams defeated the 49ers in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 Rams will be wearing replica uniforms of the 1951 NFL championship 
Rams, who lost their first meeting with San Francisco that year, 44-17. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship Rams rebounded to beat the 49ers in 1951, 23-16, but Ram 
victories at the expense of the 49ers are ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams lead the series with the 49ers 48-39-2, but have lost the last seven 
games in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Sevier, a student of NFL history who coaches the special teams for the 
Rams, studies videotape daily and is privy to the present-day strengths and 
weaknesses of friend and foe. 
</P>
<P>
 He should know better, but Sevier said he looks upon today's game with San 
Francisco in Anaheim Stadium as "the battle for first place." 
</P>
<P>
 He says this with a straight face and with no regard for past performances, 
which include the Rams' being outscored, 102-37, in the last three meetings 
with San Francisco and seven consecutive defeats in Anaheim Stadium by the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts are, there are two teams in this conference 2-0, 10 teams that are 
1-1 and two teams 0-2," Sevier said. "We're one of the ones that are 1-1, tied 
for first in the division with the 49ers, and I look at this as a chance to 
take over the division lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say the Chiefs are able to go beat Atlanta, we'd be sitting 2-1. The facts 
are, we're playing for first place." 
</P>
<P>
 The facts are, the 49ers are considered overwhelming favorites in this game, 
and in the past few days have added cornerback Deion Sanders and defensive end 
Charles Mann to their roster, while the Rams have stood pat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram offense has generated three touchdowns, ranks 27th in first downs and 
26th in time of possession. As a team, the Rams have as many penalties as the 
Raiders, 19, which is second most in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, meanwhile, are projected to battle Dallas for the opportunity to 
play in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you polled people around the country, sure, they'd say we don't have a 
prayer," said Sevier, who earned two Super Bowl rings while an assistant coach 
with the Redskins. "But you don't have to be a better team in the long run to 
beat somebody. All you have to do is be better on a given day." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams are to have their day, the circumstances might get no better. The 
49ers have lost starting right tackle Harris Barton, starting right guard Ralph 
Tamm and starting defensive end Richard Dent to injuries and might be without 
starting left guard Jesse Sapolu as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they are coming off an emotionally draining defeat by the Chiefs 
and former 49er quarterback Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get a wounded animal in a corner, that's when he fights his 
hardest," said Jim Erkenbeck, Ram offensive line coach, acknowledging that most 
observers still have given the Rams no chance of beating the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of years ago, I remember the same situation when we went down and 
played the Dallas Cowgirls and just kicked the heck out of them. I'm not saying 
that's going to happen again, but it's about the same atmosphere -- when people 
who are not in the know give us no chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys had Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin and Emmitt Smith in 1992 and the 
Rams upset Dallas, 27-23. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers have Steve Young, Jerry Rice and Ricky Watters, who a year ago 
pounded the Rams, 35-10, in Anaheim Stadium, and by 40-17 in Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's in the past," said Anthony Newman, Ram safety. "This game is going to 
be a different story. Their whole offensive line is hurting a bit. It's a 
different game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't go off what Steve Young did to us last year. It won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Young threw for 462 yards against the Rams in Anaheim last season, an NFL high 
in 1993, and had four touchdown passes, including two to Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Kansas City's team, they don't have the athletes that San Francisco 
has," Newman said. "And yet they beat them. They had the pass rush, total team 
effort and played mistake-free football. San Francisco is beatable."

RIVALRY IS LEAST OF CONCERNS; PRO FOOTBALL: TALK IS FORGOTTEN AS RAIDERS AND 
BRONCOS, BOTH 0-2, SEEK TO PUT THEIR SEASONS BACK ON TRACK TODAY IN DENVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Denver Coach Wade Phillips was taking verbal shots at the Raiders. Raider 
Coach Art Shell didn't want anything to do with the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 And Raider receiver Tim Brown was telling anybody who asked that he was never 
happier as a Raider. Listen and weep, Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 It was six weeks ago, and the feud was alive and well in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are those guys here?" Phillips had said with a big smile before the 
American Bowl exhibition between the archrivals. "Nobody even likes them." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell, breaking an American Bowl tradition, wouldn't practice with the 
opposing squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides were spewing venom, shaking fists and promising dire consequences 
when they met for real. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? 
</P>
<P>
 Both squads had come to Barcelona confident of their strength, although others 
had serious reservations about the Denver defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who were shaking their fists are now scratching their heads. The 
preseason confidence has been replaced by regular-season reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody seems interested in the feud anymore. The obsession with the guys on 
the other sideline has been replaced by confusion over what's happening on 
their own sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders and the Broncos are both 0-2 heading into today's early season 
showdown, with the loser facing a formidable task of getting back into 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both teams have dug a hole," Phillips said. "One of them is going to jump in 
the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 If it's the Broncos, Phillips may need to shovel fast simply to keep his job. 
Several Denver columnists have been demanding his head this week, the Broncos 
having gotten off to their worst start since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell isn't under that kind of pressure. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
 But unless quarterback Jeff Hostetler finds his touch, the Raiders find a 
tailback and the defensive line finds a way to make up for the loss of AWOL end 
Scott Davis, the team doesn't figure to turn things around dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler has been uncharacteristically erratic in his first two games but 
continues to deny that he has an arm injury. The Raider quarterback has not sat 
out a practice this week, however, and has looked sharper. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell has accepted some of the blame for the failure of his rushing attack. 
"We really haven't given our running backs a chance," he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have only 34 carries for 133 yards in two games. Shell said he 
would like to see his rushers get 25 carries per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is expected to skip his second consecutive game after storming out of 
the team's training headquarters on Sept. 6 for still unexplained reasons. If 
his tender hamstring permits, Jerry Ball will start at defensive tackle for the 
second consecutive week, with Nolan Harrison moving to Davis' end position. The 
other starters, defensive end Anthony Smith and tackle Chester McGlockton, 
remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 All four figure to earn their paychecks today. Chasing Bronco quarterback John 
Elway around in the energy-sapping, thin altitude of Mile High Stadium is never 
an easy task. But forced to do so with only one veteran reserve, Aundray Bruce, 
on the bench is really asking a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver's problems can be boiled down to one thing: defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The club spent a lot of time and money in the off-season, giving Elway even 
more tools to work with -- wide receiver Anthony Miller and running back 
Leonard Russell. There's no question the Broncos can score. Keeping opponents 
from scoring, however, is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver has given up 62 points in its two games, a total exceeded in the AFC 
West only by -- you guessed it -- the Raiders, who have surrendered a 
league-leading 82. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever they give up, the Raiders seem to find a way to score more than the 
Broncos. They did so in that Barcelona exhibition, winning in overtime. And 
they did it in a playoff meeting last January, eliminating Denver. And they 
have done so consistently in the regular season. The Raiders have won the last 
three regular-season games between the two and eight of the last nine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos haven't had any greater success off the field. They figured they 
had snared Brown, a free agent, in the off-season by getting him to sign a 
lucrative offer sheet, only to have the Raiders match it. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Raider owner Al Davis last spring: "We beat them both on and off the 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, neither side has been beating anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a tie, that will end for one team today. For the other, the agony 
might be only beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Willie Broughton, desperately needed on the thin defensive 
line, is not expected to be ready today. . . . Denver Coach Wade Phillips says 
tight end Shannon Sharpe, recovering from strained knee ligaments suffered in 
the season opener, will play. But Sharpe is not ready to make that commitment 
until he sees how he feels in the pregame warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronco running back Rod Bernstine is expected to start. How long he will last, 
however, remains to be seen because he continues to be plagued by a hamstring 
injury that has bothered him since last season. . . . Not activated for today's 
game were newly acquired running back Jerrod Bunch, rookie running back Calvin 
Jones, defensive end Scott Davis and offensive lineman Rich Stephens.

MIKE DOWNEY: IT WILL BE LIGHTS OUT FOR ONE OR THE OTHER IN TONEY-JONES FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The club is an ornate blues joint on Sunset, with exotic wood carvings and 
folk artwork by Kurt Zimmerman and Howard Finster along the walls, beneath 
handmade signs atop doorways that read: NO FIGHTING IN HERE. A menu tantalizes 
with red beans and dirty rice, jambalaya and Blackened Voodoo beer, and the 
musical marquee offers an even more tantalizing N'Orleans variety from 
Buckwheat Zydeco to the Neville Brothers, with a sprinkle of spicy blues acts 
in between.  
</P>
<P>
 In strolls James Toney, in suit and shades. "The baddest man on the planet," 
he introduces himself, looking for trouble, looking for any casus belli to 
provoke a response. 
</P>
<P>
 In follows Roy Jones Jr., no wallflower himself. He backs down from no man, 
from no truth or dare. He once stepped into a boxing ring wearing a dog collar. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Already the rhythm and blues is playing inside their heads, the percussion of 
fists and shouting of crowds in Vegas that will accompany their middleweight 
prizefight Nov. 18 at the MGM Grand, the first really great fight of this 
generation. This is the one even promoter Bob Arum wasn't overselling when he 
called it "the best fight of the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 There was another fight Saturday night that might have been the keeper of the 
decade, Julio Cesar Chavez versus Meldrick Taylor, had it been held three years 
ago when it should have been. But that was a hot bout that simmered too long. 
Whereas this one, Toney and Jones, has everything boxing has been waiting for, 
begging for, two undefeated hitters in their prime, a dollop of bad blood, the 
prospect of more spilled.  
</P>
<P>
 In a neutral corner of the blues club stands Sugar Ray Leonard, last of the 
red-hot glovers, yesteryear's icon with a vested interest in the combatants of 
the present, affiliated as he is with the hotel serving as host. Leonard sounds 
more than a little impressed with Toney. More than a little impressed with 
Jones. They remind him of, well, him.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most anticipated fight of the '90s, with good reason," says Sugar 
Ray, fit and cool in a white suit coat, long past his prime but hardly gone to 
seed. "This fight, well, this fight reminds everyone, including me, of my 
fights with Duran, of my fight with Hagler, of, of. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 It's on the tip of his tongue.  
</P>
<P>
 Someone says, "Hearns?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Hearns!" Leonard says. "Sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 High praise indeed. Those were the most memorable of non-heavyweight bouts, in 
spite of any momentary lapse of memory on Leonard's part. His brawls with 
Roberto Duran, his ambush of an almost universally favored Marvin Hagler, his 
nonstop-action war with Thomas Hearns, those were the fights that coaxed half 
of Hollywood to ringside and drew hundreds of thousands into theaters to view 
on closed-circuit. It was the age of Boxing Beyond Ali, keeping interest alive 
in a dying sport.  
</P>
<P>
 Toney and Jones. Finally, a fight with a couple of raging bulls, rather than 
one with someone ready to be put out to pasture. Don't go swallowing what 
Lights Out Toney says when he takes you aside almost confidentially and assures 
you, "Roy Jones ain't fit to carry my gym bag." This is the way Toney works 
himself up into a lather, arms himself for combat.  
</P>
<P>
 It is his specialty, in fact, the pre-fight. Toney is the mean-as-a- wolverine 
mangler from Ann Arbor, Mich., who set the tone for future fights at a weigh-in 
alongside one Albert Gonzalez, to whom he turned and snarled: "You're nothing." 
This in turn inspired Michael Nunn to condescendingly pat Toney on the pate 
before their little get-together, whereupon it took several strong men to pry 
the two apart. Toney then wiped up the floor with Nunn.  
</P>
<P>
 Last time we saw Lights Out in these parts, he was helping launch the 
reopening of the Grand Olympic Auditorium. Matched with an anonymous pug named 
Tim Littles who violently head-butted him, a blood-smeared Toney was told by 
the referee after three rounds that Round 4 would be the last, no matter what. 
He promptly sent Littles to dreamland. 
</P>
<P>
 Charming fellow, Toney.  
</P>
<P>
 "I go into any fight wanting to decapitate somebody," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 However, he does not daunt Jones, not so one would know it. Jones acknowledges 
fear only of earthquakes, making him reluctant to visit Los Angeles even for 
promotional purposes. As long as the room stands still, he will go toe to toe 
with Toney any time convenient to both.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine in L.A., as long as nothing strange happens," Jones says. "It ain't 
that I'm afraid. Like a tornado brewing in the gulf, I don't run from them. 
It's just that fighting somebody like Toney is easier, because, oh, you know, 
here's something I can volunteer for." 
</P>
<P>
 They were in no particular rush to arrange this date, until Arum and others 
emphasized that the public was getting sick of paying good money to see clowns 
and has-beens and pudgy pugilists who couldn't be struck below the belt because 
they were all belt. Arum made it clear that boxing needed a bout between two 
men who had arrived, not one guy on his way up opposing someone on his way 
down.  
</P>
<P>
 Even those who dislike boxing might like this one. Toney and Jones go together 
like red beans and rice. They were meant for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only one thing about Jones," says Toney. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes? 
</P>
<P>
 "He ain't never been in no earthquake till he been hit by me."

WHITEY HERZOG WILL BE OFFERED POSITION AS ROYALS' MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitey Herzog, who resigned last January as general manager of the Angels, 
will be offered the vacant Kansas City Royals' managerial job, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there's no assurance he will accept the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog, who is scheduled to talk this week with the Royals, actually was 
offered the job in midseason but declined, allowing Hal McRae to continue as 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 McRae was fired Thursday, and the Royals once again will attempt to persuade 
Herzog to return to managing. The job would reunite him with close friend 
George Brett, who retired after the 1993 season and is the Royals' vice 
president/baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
 If Herzog, 62, declines, Chicago Cub third base coach Tony Muser is expected 
to be a leading candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog, who could not be reached for comment, has not managed since July 6, 
1990 when he resigned as manager of the St. Louis Cardinals. He became vice 
president/player personnel for the Angels one month later. Herzog managed the 
Royals to three division titles from 1976-1978. BOB NIGHTENGALE

HARPER'S GOT RIGHT TEAM, RIGHT ($19.4 MILLION) MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers scoffed when guard Ron Harper demanded a $20-million, five-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chicago Bulls nearly met Harper's asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the deal said Harper signed a $19.4-million, five-year 
guaranteed contract with the Bulls on Friday night. Harper will earn $2.4 
million in 1994-95 with raises of 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper said the Bulls were his first choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always liked the Bulls," he said at a news conference Saturday at the 
Bulls' practice facility in Deerfield, Ill. "The guys who played here won three 
championship rings. They had a spot for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who spent 5 1/2 seasons with the Clippers, was happy to leave a team 
that compiled the NBA's seventh-worst record last season (27-55). 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some good years out there and I had some very bad years out there," he 
said. "A ballplayer wants to win. I tried to play hard, but we did not compete 
as a team a lot of last year. With the Bulls now, I feel we will compete as a 
team."

RECREATION; SENIOR SOFTBALL PLAYERS LIVE OUT THEIR DREAMS ON THE DIAMOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some journeys begin later than others. A group of softball players from 
Thousand Oaks have made up for lost time, however. They hit the ground at age 
55 and didn't stop until they qualified for a national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, a team of men 55 and over, played in the Senior Softball World 
Series last weekend, winning two games and losing four. The tournament 
culminated five years of effort, transforming a team that was winless in 1988 
into one that from 1991 to 1993 racked up 44 consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 You're never too old for dreams to come true. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started, our objective was to win a championship of any kind," said 
Glenn Krupp, a player-coach since 1989 who at 62 is the same age as one of his 
heroes, Mickey Mantle. "Then our goal was to win a league. Then it became 
getting to the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our next goal is to win that darn thing. Then we can say we've done it all." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Series, held in Scottsdale, Ariz., ended in disappointing fashion. 
After going 2-2 in pool play, the Panthers advanced to the double-elimination 
phase and lost two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The second loss was the toughest. Trailing, 5-0, in the fourth inning, the 
Panthers rallied to score four runs with two out. A bases-loaded triple by Herb 
Jellander, who at 58 is the same age as Bill Mazeroski, appeared to give the 
Panthers a 7-5 lead, but the first runner was called out for not crossing the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 Finish line? In Senior Softball, a runner does not have to touch home plate to 
score a run, but merely must cross a line much as a sprinter does in a race. 
</P>
<P>
 Confounded rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "That took the heart out of us," said Krupp, who watched the team lose, 10-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers are pumped up again, though. They are preparing for the Gold 
Coast Senior Olympics Oct. 1-2 in Oxnard, a tournament they won last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the fall, the team will split into two squads -- one for players 60 
and over, the other for those 55-59. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like when the seniors golf tour started. It resurrected all these old 
golfers," said Jerry DeGennaro, a third baseman who at 57 is the same age as 
Brooks Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Krupp began building in 1989 with cronies Bob Evans, Frank Pavone and Jim 
Tate. They added Billy Swartz, Larry Brown and Ron Ellen a year later, Don 
DeMello and Jim Cratty in '91 and Dan Jones, Bob Biel and Jellander in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time the Panthers were roaring, winning back-to-back championships in 
the Gold Coast League, composed of teams from Santa Barbara to Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking for recreation and friendship and I got more than I bargained 
for," said Brown, at 62 the same age as Eddie Mathews. "I played hardball and 
basketball as a young man. Athletics helps your mind as well as your body. It 
helps me keep a positive attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 With the addition of DeGennaro in '93 and Jessie Washington and Joe 
Palmintiero this year, the World Series roster was complete. As players are 
added, others inevitably are dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are younger, you get better every year, but with us, the opposite is 
true," Krupp said. "We owe so much to the guys who are no longer with us. They 
helped turn this team into a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Gold Coast Senior Olympics will take place the first two weekends in 
October at several sites in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Aquatics will be held at Rancho Simi pool in Simi Valley, a golf tournament 
will be held in Ojai, a 5k run will be held in Ventura, and several events will 
be held at community centers in Santa Paula and in Oxnard.

COUPLE FACES A BRICK WALL IN FINDING EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE FOR THEIR EAGLE ROCK 
HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article regarding the pullback of homeowners insurers in California ("A 
Crisis on Hold," Sept. 3) barely touches the surface of the crisis that some 
homeowners are facing now or within the next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 As owners of a pre-1945 house insured by 20th Century Insurance Co., we are 
facing a brick wall in trying to insure our home. In less than two years, 20th 
Century will not renew our policy. This is despite the fact that our "old home" 
has withstood earthquakes since 1925 without any damage. None of the 
"competing" insurance companies will write us a policy at this time. We have 
contacted State Farm (with whom we have another policy), the Automobile Club, 
Safeco, Allstate and Farmers Insurance, and all either are not writing new 
policies or claim that the house is not insurable because of its age. 
</P>
<P>
 What are we going to do when 20th Century cancels our policy? Any house of any 
age in California is at risk from an earthquake, as evidenced by the fact that 
many of the damaged Northridge homes were built since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill in front of Gov. Pete Wilson empowering him to prevent insurers from 
terminating or refusing to renew policies would be one giant step in helping 
owners. Another would be passage of a federal disaster insurance program that 
would spread the risk of all natural disasters among everyone around the 
country. Isn't that what insurance is all about?

<P>
 So Republic Insurance Group is pulling out of California, you say ("Republic 
to End Homeowners Policies in State," Aug. 30)? Couldn't make enough profit, 
couldn't pay enough bloated bonuses to "executives" (i.e., private bureaucrats) 
to make it worthwhile to serve the people of this state? Unhappy about the 
unsuccessful court challenge to Proposition 103 and the prospect of finally 
having to pay the people instead of a bunch of lawyers hired to fight the 
people's wishes? 
</P>
<P>
 What a pleasure it will be to vote 'yes' on Proposition 186 after the 
insurance industry's campaign of lies and distortions fails. After we get you 
out of our health insurance and collect what you owe us from Proposition 103, 
we'll insure ourselves and get you parasites out of our lives for good by 
self-insuring our property, too. You can't quit us -- you're fired!

COLUMNIST'S ADVICE ON ETHICS UNETHICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'll bet columnist Carla Lazzareschi would scream bloody murder and the 
National Assn. of Security Dealers' phones would light up if the brokerage firm 
owed her $91 ("Brokerage's Foul-Up Clearly Its to Swallow," Aug. 28). Yet 
somehow all is OK if the customer doesn't want to live up to their end of the 
deal and deliver what was sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Lazzareschi appears to champion the downtrodden against the evil brokerage 
empire when she states, "The broker clearly made a mistake and should own up to 
it." Was it not the customer who requested the broker sell 100 shares? After 
making the sale, was it a mistake to expect delivery of 100 shares? 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission requires public companies to notify 
shareholders of changes in capitalization such as reverse stock splits. Was it 
the broker's mistake the customer failed to exchange the old shares for new as 
requested? If a bank mistakenly credits money to your account, it is illegal to 
spend that money. Why is it OK to keep the money from this mistake? Ms. 
Lazzareschi sees no problem with the customer keeping money from the sale of 
shares he didn't own (". . . you are not breaking any laws") and in the same 
breath suggests the branch manager be contacted if the customer was treated 
shabbily! 
</P>
<P>
 The broker lived up to his end of the bargain based on what the customer said 
they owned ("The check arrived promptly"). Despite this, Ms. Lazzareschi 
devotes two paragraphs to telling readers how to report unethical behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Please tell me what's so ethical about keeping that which does not belong to 
you? What is so ethical about not correcting a mistake that you instigated? 
Knee-jerk answers make for poor advice.

CRIME ISN'T THE WAY FLANIGAN DESCRIBES IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of James Flanigan's overview on present-day and future crime ("Social Change 
Cheaper Than $30-Billion Crime Bill," Aug. 28): Mr. Flanigan's data and 
thinking are seriously off the mark on several points. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the decline in crimes against property apparent from FBI statistics is 
fallacious; plea bargaining and overextended police work caused by serious 
financial shortfalls among America's states, counties and municipalities -- not 
a decline in crime -- are what in fact exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, an aging society (such as ours) will not necessarily enjoy safer 
streets and schools, for with aging comes the calcification of the imagination, 
intellect, vision and courage to attempt new approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, of drive-bys and areas normally quite light in homicides, more and more 
of the killers are younger and younger; a majority of experts and anointed 
prognosticators appear to be saying that we ain't seen nothing yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, it is woeful and ironic that we have transmogrified into a society 
largely ruled by an ethos distrustful of and hostile toward empirical evidence, 
the scientific method and the medical model -- we who pride ourselves and take 
comfort in our scientific and medical technologies and prowess. A return to the 
mid-1950s' criminal and juvenile justice laws and protocols that gave 
Californians a civility and optimism envied by the people of every other state 
in America will be achieved only when our politicians, jurists and 
prince-makers are willing to subordinate the gambits and shtick of callow, 
profit-driven attorneys to the peer-reviewed literature, objective facts and 
responsible expert opinion of licensed clinicians, social workers and 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that day, we shall endure being a land unsafe for children at play, at 
school or just eating pizza at the beach, and for oldsters on their way to the 
market or pharmacy, and for market clerks doing their damnedest, and for 
stressed-out police officers.

WHERE PROP. 103 MENTALITY COULD LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times reported that 20th Century's stock plummeted on the news that its 
constitutional challenge to Proposition 103 was rejected ("20th Century 
Industries Shares Fall Nearly 25%," Aug. 20). Ralph Nader lauded the ruling as 
proving the constitutionality of Proposition 103.Actually, what happened is 
that the court legalized theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Any money that a business earns through free voluntary exchanges with 
individuals may now be taken by force through a vote of the people. The logical 
consequence of this decision is that anyone's money may be seized if that be 
the whim of the people. In essence, nobody's claim to property is valid. Jews 
in pre-World War II Germany would understand this situation well. "Life, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness" is no longer the presumption in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from overpaid insurance companies, what about overpaid baseball players? 
Or overpaid actors or physicians? Why should they have more than we? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's introduce a sweeping new Proposition 103 and level the entire playing 
field so no one has any wealth at all. Of course, there would be little 
incentive for anyone to achieve or to produce anything, and that might further 
erode our standard of living, but at least we would all be impoverished 
equally. That would be real democracy.

FORTUNE 500 A DATED IDEA IN GLOBAL MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I can understand your desire to convey the impression that all is well with 
Southern California's business climate despite the grave loss of the 
headquarters of the Lockheed Corp. ("Smaller Firms Spell Exiting Aging Giants," 
Sept. 5). It is thusly reassuring for the Los Angeles Times to state that 
California still has the largest number of Fortune 500 headquarters of any 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Fortune 500 is itself becoming increasingly dated when 
measured in the global marketplace. Seven of the top 10 largest firms in the 
world are now headquartered in Japan. Most of those firms dwarf anything the 
United States has to offer. You had considerable commentary about the combined 
size of Lockeed-Martin. However, at $20 billion-plus, the merged firms are a 
mere drop in the bucket of the global economy. Japan's largest firm, Itochu, 
has annual sales of $180 billion-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe, therefore, that the Los Angeles Times does a disservice to the 
community when it downplays the loss of the headquarters of a firm like 
Lockheed which was central to the growth of Southern California over the last 
50 years. Instead of trying to foster the lowest wage area in the world 
(through editorial endorsement of wide open immigration), the Los Angeles Times 
might instead study how Japan has become the world's most powerful (by far) 
economy.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: GIFTS TO PARENTS INVOLVE SOME RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. Every year I put $20,000 into my parents' brokerage account as a gift. The 
stock generates some welcome dividend income for them and, because they are in 
a low-income tax bracket, the income is not eaten up by taxes. I will 
eventually inherit their estate, which, because of its relatively small size, 
should not be subject to estate taxes. My plan seems sound to me, but I worry 
about any potential income tax ramifications that I haven't thought of. What do 
your experts say? -- R.R.C . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Your plan passes muster with the experts, with a few caveats. First, let's 
explain why the experts like your strategy: By giving your parents cash that 
can be used to purchase an appreciable asset, you stand to inherit securities 
investments whose tax basis will be stepped-up upon the death of your parents. 
This means that the cash you give them can grow without generating a tax 
liability for you. Further, because your parents are in a low tax bracket, they 
can take maximum advantage of the dividends that these investments generate 
over the course of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Now let's discuss the potential pitfalls: First, you should be sure that the 
total value of your parents' estate does not exceed the federal limits on the 
amount that can be passed on to heirs free of estate taxes. (These limits are 
$600,000 per person or $1.2 million per couple if all the assets are held in 
joint tenancy or as community property.) You should also be aware that your 
parents are under no obligation to leave their estate to you. If there is any 
indication that they are under such an obligation, your annual donations into 
their brokerage account can be deemed to be an incomplete gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, you should realize that any money invested in the stock market or 
other securities is not completely secure; not only could the account not grow, 
the principal could be at risk. Your parents are also free to use the proceeds 
in the account as they wish over the course of their lifetimes. They could be 
needed for medical expenses, another emergency -- or maybe a trip around the 
world! Remember, if you have truly made a gift of the funds, you have no say 
over how they are used. Social Security Benefits Refused After Divorce 
</P>
<P>
 Q. In a recent column you discussed the rules governing divorced spouses 
receiving Social Security. You said a couple had to be married 10 years for one 
spouse to claim benefits on the other's account. My Social Security 
representative refused my claim because I had been married only 17 years. Am I 
being given incorrect information? -- L.M . 
</P>
<P>
 A. A representative of the Social Security Administration says the 10-year 
marriage requirement -- which replaced the 20-year requirement in 1978 -- 
applies to all Americans with only one exception: certain, older government 
employees who were not covered by Social Security. The question you must answer 
is: Were you eligible to receive, or were you actually receiving, a government 
pension of any type before Dec. 1, 1982? If the answer is "yes," then you must 
have been married 20 years to qualify for spousal Social Security benefits; if 
"no," then the requirement is 10 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you did not say whether you were a government employee or give your 
date of retirement or age, Social Security representatives say that it is 
highly unlikely that you are affected by the 20-year rule if you were born 
after 1920. You should revisit your local Social Security Administration office 
immediately if you have been given misinformation by them. Reporting Foreign 
Property Sale to IRS 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I recently sold some property in a foreign country. I paid all taxes from 
the transaction to that country's government, which has a reciprocal tax 
agreement with the United States. I am a citizen and resident of the United 
States. Do I have to report this transaction to the IRS? If so, how do I do it? 
-- A.B . 
</P>
<P>
 A. You must report the sale. But beware: Even though the United States has a 
reciprocal tax agreement with the country in which your property is located, 
you may not be eligible for a complete credit on those taxes. Here are the 
steps you must follow: 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the sale should be listed on Schedule D. You should compute your 
foreign tax credit by completing Form 1116. Instructions on the form will take 
you through the steps necessary to determine what portion of the taxes you paid 
to the foreign country will be credited against any tax obligation you have in 
the United States. The critical factor in determining what portion of the taxes 
already paid qualify as a credit is the tax rate imposed by the foreign country 
on your income compared to that of the United States. If the foreign country's 
rate is higher, the IRS will not give you a full credit for those taxes. Bounty 
Hunter's Logic Looks Full of Holes 
</P>
<P>
 Q. A friend of mine works as a bounty hunter, hunting down people who have 
jumped bail. He argues that his income is tax-exempt because the bounty he 
receives is a redemption or rebate. He compares it to the cents-off coupons 
offered by grocery stores and the dollars-back rebates so popular among auto 
manufacturers. Can this possibly be right? -- G.F . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Absolutely not! Earned income is taxable no matter what. Your friend cannot 
get around this no matter what he claims. His payments are neither a gift nor a 
rebate. He is simply being paid a portion of the amount owed by the person he 
has found. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you think about it, how could his payments be considered a rebate? A 
rebate is simply the lowering of a purchase price; you have to spend money to 
get it. Your friend is doing nothing more than devising an elaborate excuse for 
cheating on his taxes.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: RETIREE WONDERS: WHAT ABOUT MY PORTFOLIO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carl Miller of Sun City, Ariz., has a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to find information as to what your portfolio should look 
like once you're retired," says the 58-year-old former nuclear engineer who 
retired eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-nine percent of the articles you read about retirement deal with 
getting to retirement." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be an exaggeration, but it's safe to say that retirement-planning 
coverage focuses on the view of those still working. 
</P>
<P>
 Graying baby boomers, in particular, have been a favored audience, and for 
good reason. Boomers represent a huge market -- roughly 78 million Americans 
were born between 1947 and 1965 -- and for the most part they have been deemed 
to be poor savers. 
</P>
<P>
 And a large number of them will live well into their 80s and 90s, requiring 
them to make some investment decisions for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
 But for today's retirees, especially those who want to keep their cache 
growing while siphoning off money for living expenses, considerations are a 
little different. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to accomplish this tricky task, many advisers say, is to remain 
committed to stock market investments for at least part of your retirement 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Returns on large stocks have exceeded the inflation rate by an average seven 
percentage points a year for most of this century, says Ibbotson Associates of 
Chicago, and small stocks have done even better. But bond returns have 
surpassed inflation by only about two percentage points annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is not whether to include equities, but how much to include," 
says Ken Gregory, co-editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst newsletter in Orinda, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory believes two of his newsletter's model portfolios would be appropriate 
for retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, a global-balanced mix designed to throw off income, has a mere 40% 
stake in bond mutual funds, with nearly half that in foreign investments. U.S. 
stock funds account for 31% of assets and international equity funds another 
18%. The remaining 11% is in a real estate stock fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The second, a global-balanced portfolio for which income is not a main 
consideration, is a bit more aggressive. It's similar to the first portfolio, 
except that the bond weighting drops to 32% and the foreign-stock percentage 
climbs to 26%. 
</P>
<P>
 Both portfolios would have a low probability of loss for someone willing to 
hang on at least two full years, Gregory believes. 
</P>

 Sheldon Jacobs, publisher of the No-Load Fund Investor newsletter in 
Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y., offers a model portfolio for retirees that's in the 
same ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 He recommends 45% in domestic stock funds, 35% in bond portfolios and the 
remainder in international equity investments. Jacobs' modest bond commitment 
partly reflects his belief that the bond market isn't likely to advance much 
anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 That both Jacobs and Gregory suggest some foreign-stock holdings for retirees 
might come as a surprise, especially since both also advocate a modest position 
in volatile emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But foreign investing makes sense from both a diversification and 
opportunistic standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even for a retired person who is conservative, 5% to 10% in an 
emerging-markets fund isn't going to make or break the portfolio," Gregory 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The above recommendations are geared for a retiree around age 65; individuals 
older than that might want to boost income holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 These suggestions also assume the person has an investment horizon of at least 
a few years and doesn't need to draw down the account quickly to meet living 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 An underlying theme to retirement investing is that withdrawing money 
periodically from stock funds can be better than merely living off the 
dividends generated by bond funds. This goes against the accepted wisdom of 
spending the yield but not touching the principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have stock funds, reinvest the dividends and take what you need 
periodically, you may do better because of the growth potential," agrees Steve 
Norwitz, a vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggests that retirees put 25% to 60% of their investment assets into stock 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your focus should be more on a suitable asset allocation than the yield per 
se," Norwitz says. 
</P>
<P>
 People who own international mutual funds tend to be wealthier and slightly 
older than fund investors in general and are more likely to be men, according 
to a survey by Scudder, Stevens & Clark in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical international-fund owner is 48, earns $66,800 a year and has 
$159,800 in financial assets. That compares to the typical mutual fund 
investor, who is 45, earns $57,900 and has financial assets worth $87,200. All 
of the above figures are medians. 
</P>
<P>
 And while 54% of fund owners are men, the ratio climbs to 65% among those 
holding one or more foreign portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 Scudder's survey involved telephone conversations with 1,000 fund-owning 
households nationwide. The results are considered reliable to plus or minus 
four percentage points.

Act 
</P>
<P>
 Portfolios that combine stock and bond mutual funds with money market 
investments aren't necessarily all that risky, even for retirees. Shown below 
are four possible investment mixes and how they would have fared over the 20 
years through 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Minimal-Risk Portfolio 
</P>
<P>
 Composition: 100% cash (money market investments) 
</P>
<P>
 Average yearly return: +7.5% 
</P>
<P>
 Worst year's result: +2.9% 
</P>
<P>
 Years with negative return: 0 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation-adjusted average yearly return: +1.6% 
</P>
<P>
 2. Low-Risk Portfolio 
</P>
<P>
 Composition: 25% stocks, 40% bonds, 35% cash 
</P>
<P>
 Average yearly return: +10.4% 
</P>
<P>
 Worst year's result: -4% 
</P>
<P>
 Years with negative return: 2 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation-adjusted average yearly return: +4.5% 
</P>
<P>
 3. Moderate-Risk Portfolio 
</P>
<P>
 Composition: 40% stocks, 40% bonds, 20% cash 
</P>
<P>
 Average yearly return: +11.3% 
</P>
<P>
 Worst year's result: -9.3%

</P>
<P>
 Inflation-adjusted average yearly return: +5.4% 
</P>
<P>
 4. High-Risk Portfolio 
</P>
<P>
 Composition: 60% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% cash 
</P>
<P>
 Average yearly return: +12.1% 
</P>
<P>
 Worst year's result: -15.6% 
</P>
<P>
 Years with negative return: 3 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation-adjusted average yearly return: +6.2% 
</P>
<P>
 Note: The above returns are based on unmanaged investment indexes, which means 
actual results would have been slightly less because of expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock component assumes an 85% weighting in U.S. stocks and a 15% stake in 
foreign equities.

HOW FUND FAILED THEM; TEACHERS' RELIANCE ON COLLEAGUES COST DEARLY WHEN LAND 
DEALS SOURED

 The teachers' lounge at Commonwealth Elementary School in Fullerton was an 
unlikely place for financial wheeling and dealing. Visitors were more likely to 
find teachers Louise Carmichael) and Norma Elgas) swapping stories about 
wayward students as they shared their brown-bag lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carmichael was eager to listen one afternoon in 1972 when Elgas, a popular 
sixth-grade teacher, mentioned a Newport Beach investment company with the 
motto "Teachers Helping Teachers." Elgas talked enthusiastically about Teachers 
Management & Investment Corp., a small company that was giving hundreds of 
Southern California educators access to the booming California real estate 
market by putting up as little as $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 300 schoolteachers across California were moonlighting as 
part-timers for TMI, as it was called, using low-key but effective sales 
pitches. Though Elgas was not an official salesperson, she did not hesitate to 
talk about her successful investing with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just told me about TMI like you would tell someone, 'Oh, Mervyn's has 
some real pretty T-shirts,' " Carmichael said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmichael, now 62, and her husband, Elmer, eventually invested $195,000 of 
their retirement money through real estate partnerships marketed by TMI. And, 
as California's real estate market thrived, the investments paid solid 
dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as real estate prices soured in recent years, the returns have dwindled 
-- or disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Even 67-year-old Elgas, now a retiree living in Arroyo Grande near San Luis 
Obispo, said she has no hope of recovering $10,000 of her funds, as several of 
her TMI investments in raw land sit stagnant, with no ready buyers for the 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmichael, also now retired, says she wonders whether the company's motto 
should have been "Teachers Using Teachers." In August, Carmichael and three 
other investors, Jean M. Sweeney of Fullerton, Katherine B. Seibert of Anaheim 
Hills and Stanley T. Clough filed a lawsuit against 27-year-old TMI alleging 
that the company is insolvent and has lost $100 million through fraud by its 
original and current owners. The suit, filed in Orange County Superior Court, 
has prompted an investigation by the state Department of Real Estate. TMI's 
owners deny any wrongdoing, blaming the troubled real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, a judge may decide whether to take control of TMI from its current 
owners and appoint a receiver who would act to preserve any remaining TMI 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmichael regrets her role in steering peers toward TMI. "Teachers are so 
tired of making decisions for kids all day," she says, "so sometimes we want to 
leave other decisions up to someone else, someone we trust. I feel badly 
because I recommended TMI to a lot of teachers. I wish I'd kept my mouth shut." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the outcome of the investors' suit against the company, the 
story of TMI offers lessons for those who covet seemingly stunning returns 
enjoyed by friends or professional colleagues and who are prone to get in on 
the action. It also offers yet another reminder that real estate is riskier 
than it seems and that investments du jour can be a road to ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, teachers had excellent reasons to talk up the company, which grew 
from an informal investing group led by Woodland Hills resident Donald J. 
Shroyer, now 73, who spent 31 years as a teacher and principal in San Fernando 
Valley elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1960s, the USC graduate and a handful of other teachers augmented 
their salaries by dabbling in real estate. But when the group made its bids on 
houses and small tracts of land, it often lost out to better-financed real 
estate syndicates. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, a real estate expert at UCLA recommended that the Shroyer group press 
state regulators to lower minimum income and net worth requirements that 
effectively prohibited modestly paid professionals from real estate 
syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 When a top official in the state Department of Corporations balked, Shroyer 
recalls, he countered that regulators were "knocking us out of the box simply 
because we don't make $25,000 a year. All I see are syndications with doctors 
and lawyers, people likethat." 
</P>
<P>
 Shroyer brought along executives from the Los Angeles Teachers Credit Union 
when he lobbied state Department of Corporations officials to modify 
regulations governing real estate syndicates. State regulators eventually 
relented, but only if investments were made in $1,000 increments and if 
offerings were limited to teachers, administrators and retirees with degrees. 
Teachers had to prove they had a net worth of at least $35,000 and $13,500 in 
annual income. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him we're well-educated people who happen to be in a low-paying 
occupation," Shroyer said. "I told him that if anyone needed the group buying 
power and expert guidance (available through syndication) it was teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 TMI incorporated in 1967 with $250,000 invested by nearly 200 teachers. The 
fund took a conservative approach, buying tracts of land that could be resold 
easily and shying away from riskier properties. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two decades, TMI surpassed its investors' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 During the go-go 1980s when real estate was king in California, TMI had no 
trouble assembling groups of profit-seeking teachers in hotel ballrooms, where 
the company would show slides, videos and charts promoting its various real 
estate opportunities. And, not unlike the big, moneyed investors, teachers 
would gather in homes to have drinks, nibble cheese and talk about the latest 
investment -- in this case a TMI-backed real estate deal being offered. At one 
small party in Fullerton, investors sipped Parducci wine as TMI touted a 
partnership for the Parducci winery in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 To join TMI, a teacher would pay $1,000 for each unit stake in a partnership 
that would in turn pool investors' funds to buy a real estate project -- either 
a hotel, raw land, a shopping center or agricultural parcels -- on the hope 
that the values would increase or even skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors could pick which of many partnerships they wanted to join. To keep 
the property maintained, investors would pay an additional fee of about $75 
every three months. When the land was sold, investors would get their principal 
back, plus hoped-for double-digit returns. 
</P>
<P>
 In those early years, TMI hired expert accountants, lawyers and administrators 
to run the business, including real estate broker Robert W. Fitzpatrick, who 
became president in 1968. It hired hundreds of teachers to sell its 
partnerships. About 200 still sell annuities and other types of retirement 
investments for TMI Lifeplans, a company affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno resident Dee Marlin, a 68-year-old retiree, was one of those early 
salespeople. Between 1978 and 1991, when Marlin served as TMI's regional 
manager in the Central Valley, all but one of his 42-person staff were 
educators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had five doctors of education working for me," Marlin said. "One time I sat 
down and counted: Those teachers had 115 degrees among them." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the moonlighting teachers rang up a $60 commission on every $1,000 
partnership unit they sold, Shroyer was confident that the sales force wouldn't 
oversell: "I thought that, if you're going to be having coffee with the 
teachers the next day, you'd better not be putting them into anything bad." 
</P>
<P>
 That connection -- a company founded by teachers that employed teachers to 
sell exclusively to teachers -- was the key to the young company's growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Fitzpatrick said in a press release that loyalty remained strong: "We 
still make house calls, as our teachers know each other. If a client can't 
attend a symposium to see a video presentation of a new offering, we will bring 
it to your family room in your own home." 
</P>
<P>
 That familial approach, though, sometimes lulls investors into a false sense 
of security, said Sanford Goodkin, a San Diego-based real estate consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers, God bless them, are here to educate the brains of our children, and 
doctors are wonderful in healing, but they are both lousy investors," Goodkin 
said. "Some of the most successful people in the world have gotten screwed in 
real estate." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Cotchett, a Bay Area lawyer who has represented thousands of disgruntled 
investors in lawsuits filed against their advisers, said it's only natural, 
though, to follow the lead of acquaintances who have been successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it the herd syndrome," Cotchett said. "It comes in all walks of life, 
and it's not just the uninformed that march down the path. Quite to the 
contrary, it's the very informed -- or those who think that they're very 
informed." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the early investors who profited was Jim McDonald( of Laguna Beach, a 
professor at Saddleback Community College in Mission Viejo, who still has 
$100,000 invested with TMI. The 60-year-old educator said he reaped returns of 
300% on two of the more than 20 partnerships he joined. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others say that the only fair way to gauge TMI's performance is to 
track how all of its various investments have performed over the years, rather 
than focus on the recent troubles of some of its partnerships. That the company 
had a successful track record, in fact, was the main reason its part-time sales 
force was able to recruit so many other investors. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1980s, though, cracks began to appear in TMI's foundation and its 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 350-page complaint from former TMI employees and sales agents, the 
Department of Corporations in 1984 began a two-year investigation into TMI's 
real estate fees, travel expenses and accusations that TMI's former management 
made profits on land sales, which should have gone instead to TMI investors. 
Officials concluded the investigation by ruling that there was no evidence of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the department has turned down requests by angry investors to 
investigate the present owners of TMI, though the current allegations are 
different and are aimed only at TMI's latest owners. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time as the earlier investigation, two TMI directors decided 
they wanted to sell their 75% stake. So TMI President Fitzpatrick arranged for 
Centennial Savings & Loan in Santa Rosa to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, though, Centennial was in financial trouble, and federal 
regulators took it over, then offered to sell the stake in TMI back to 
Fitzpatrick. Not having the funds, he turned to James R. Martin, a longtime 
Peat Marwick accountant who had been auditing TMI's books, and Maurice B. 
Shuman, an accountant turned entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 The two businessmen combined a $4-million bank loan and $3 million in cash 
from Brentwood Associates, a Los Angeles venture capital group, to buy TMI in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they did not think Fitzpatrick was in touch with the rapidly changing 
real estate market or familiar with new tax laws, Shuman and Martin said in a 
recent interview, they asked him to leave the company after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzpatrick declined to be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman, Martin and Brentwood Associates all had high hopes for TMI and the 
real estate, hotel and other commercial properties they inherited. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very exciting," Martin said recently, because TMI "had the portfolio 
and the track record." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Pennington, general partner with Brentwood Associates, said in a statement 
at the time of the sale, "We believe that there is much more market penetration 
available and waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, Pennington admits that Brentwood's 42% stake in TMI has not 
been a winner. Although the venture capital company, with $400 million in 
assets under management, takes a hands-on approach to its investments, that 
wasn't the case with TMI. 
</P>
<P>
 "This very difficult real estate market had been tough on all the TMI 
investors, including Brentwood Associates," Pennington said. "Can TMI turn 
around? That's dependent on this real estate market." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also dependent on the skills of Shuman and Martin -- former accountants 
turned investment bankers who met in Seattle during the 1960s. The two longtime 
associates are experienced investors, having held stakes in everything from oil 
and gas partnerships to a gold mine, in addition to fishing boats, cattle and a 
wine importing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman once made headlines in the state of Washington, after officials forced 
him to pay $200,000 in restitution when a funeral home company he owned was 
charged in one of the state's largest consumer fraud protection suits. 
Washington officials said Shuman had failed to abide by a state law requiring 
that his company set aside money in a trust fund for people who had prearranged 
purchase of cemetery plots. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their lengthy investment history, Shuman and Martin said neither they, 
Brentwood nor the investors realized that the California real estate market was 
on the brink of a precipitous decline. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to one particular parcel of TMI land illustrates how the 
company's investments came under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, a TMI limited partnership paid $5.7 million for 75 undeveloped acres 
near the U.S.-Mexico border. Glossy color brochures projected a holding period 
of "two to three years" before the property could be sold. And as late as 1989 
a general partners' report stated that "The stage is set. The players know 
their parts. . . . It is not whether we profit on Otay Mesa. It is only a 
question of when and how much. We like our chances." 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership spent more money for permits to develop the land and later 
used the property as collateral for a $4-million loan. By 1993, the company 
acknowledged in a report to investors that a long-awaited industrial surge in 
the area has "subsequently 'fizzled' and died out." 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to make payments on its debt and in an attempt to stave off 
foreclosure, the Otay Mesa partnership filed for bankruptcy protection in June, 
1993. Today, because of plummeting land values, the tract is worth only $1.7 
million, according to TMI's own estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 It was more than just the real estate downturn, however, that led to the 
collapse of Otay Mesa International, disgruntled clients say. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent lawsuit said that Shuman and Martin refinanced the property's debt 
three times, ending up with a higher interest rate that was unmanageable and 
also generating fees to consulting companies such as TMI Analysts Inc., BR 
Kensington and TMI Development -- all firms wholly owned by TMI. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the suit alleges that the investor partnership agreement for Otay 
Mesa states that TMI cannot hire consultants affiliated with TMI to develop or 
construct that property. As a result, Martin and Shuman allegedly violated the 
agreement by paying development fees to those affiliated companies -- charges 
the two men deny. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's developed properties, too, have been hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI spent $45 million, for example, to build the Ramada Renaissance Hotel in 
Walnut Creek, which opened in 1987. Three years later, its value had fallen "by 
an astounding 67%," according to TMI. The property eventually went into 
foreclosure and was sold for $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheraton Sunrise Hotel in Sacramento, which TMI built at a cost of $24 
million, filed for bankruptcy protection in 1988 and was subsequently sold for 
about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors say that more than the real estate downturn is behind the 
company's financial woes. The four who filed suit in Orange County blame Shuman 
and Martin for their losses, saying that the owners illegally used money from 
profitable properties to prop up losers. The investors allege in their 
complaint that the men commingled funds and siphoned off millions of dollars of 
investors' money. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maury DeWald, who is a partner with Irvine investment firm Verity 
Financial and served as volunteer chairman of the Los Angles County United Way 
campaign from 1991 to 1993, has nothing put praise for Martin and Shuman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim has always had a reputation as a resourceful, bright and knowledgeable 
guy," DeWald said of Martin. "He's advised any number of businesses in terms of 
operating and tax strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 DeWald, who has known Martin since the 1970s, when both men worked for 
accounting giant Peat Marwick, said the suit "strikes me as disgruntled 
investors, and you have to question how many of them there really are." 
</P>
<P>
 When Martin and Shuman bought TMI, DeWald said, "they went into it knowing 
that it was a long, tough road. . . . I think they simply wound up fighting 
fires they didn't know existed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ron Rus, the attorney representing TMI investors in their lawsuit, thinks 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "They inherited these properties seven years ago, and they have had many 
opportunities to get out of the hot spots, which they decline," he said. "But 
they continued TMI in order to collect quarterly assessments from the teachers 
and bleed the partnerships to perpetuate the scheme."

YOUR MONEY; WHERE THERE'S A WILL... 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Anyone with heirs or assets needs a will. But only some people benefit from 
hiring an attorney -- at a cost ranging from a few hundred to several thousand 
dollars -- to write one. Whether you need help depends largely on your age, 
assets and family situation. This short quiz can help you decide. 
</P>
<P>
 1. My total assets, including cash, life insurance, securities, equity in real 
estate and personal effects, amount to a: less than $100,000 b: between 
$100,000 and $600,000 c: more than $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 2. My family, to which I plan to leave the bulk of my estate, consists of a: 
my spouse and our kids b: my current spouse, and my kids from both marriages c: 
my spouse, former spouse(s:, stepchildren, adopted children, foster children, 
nieces, nephews, cousins and grandchildren from several marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 3. I'd like my will to a: pass my assets to my family and appoint appropriate 
guardians for my children b: pass my assets to family, friends and charity and 
appoint guardians for my children c: only pass my assets to beneficiaries who 
will continue to do what I want them to after I'm gone. 
</P>
<P>
 4. I have a family business: a: No b: Not yet, but I plan to c: Yes 
</P>
<P>
 5. My assets are predominantly a: cash and liquid securities, such as 
exchange-listed stocks b: mixed between stocks, bonds and residential real 
estate c: real estate, minority interests in partnerships, stocks, bonds and 
investments in closely-held companies. 
</P>
<P>
 6. I hate the idea of my heirs paying tax or probate fees on the money I leave 
them: a: No b: It doesn't bother me as long as the fees and taxes aren't 
excessive. a: Yes; I'll spend what it takes to make sure my heirs don't have to 
pay later. 
</P>
<P>
 7. My heirs are a: responsible people who get along with one another and are 
likely to agree to my wishes. b: responsible adults and minor children whose 
ability to handle bequests hasn't been tested c: flakes, incapacitated, or 
reasonable people who simply don't get along. 
</P>
<P>
 8. I'd like to set up a trust that will distribute a: money to my children 
when they're older b: money to charity c: income on some assets to my spouse 
and equity in those assets to charity or to children. 
</P>
<P>
 9. I have used estate planning or asset-protection strategies with some of my 
assets: a: No. b: Not yet, but I may. c: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 10. I am uncertain about whether I can create a valid will using a will kit or 
form and would feel more comfortable if I hired a professional to do it for me: 
a: No. b: It wouldn't make me more comfortable, but my spouse would be 
considerably relieved. c: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Score: Give yourself one point for each "a" answer; three points for each "b" 
and 10 points for each "c." 
</P>
<P>
 Key: 
</P>
<P>
 10-18 points: You're a perfect candidate for a do-it-yourself will, but be 
sure to review your will in a few years, particularly if your assets, personal 
aims or family situation change. For now, however, check your local library for 
a listing of books that can help you prepare your will. Or, if you're 
technologically literate, consider a will-preparation software program, such as 
WillMaker. The cost of the manuals and computer programs range from $15 to $70. 
</P>
<P>
 19-49: You've got some issues that are straight forward enough to handle 
easily with a computer program or kit but a handful of issues complex enough -- 
or a comfort level low enough -- to warrant an adviser. If you opt to write 
your will, consider having an attorney review it. If you're in this category 
primarily because your estate is worth more than $600,000, consider talking to 
a tax or estate planner. 
</P>
<P>
 50-100: Hire an attorney. You should expect to pay between a few hundred and 
$1,000 for a formal will, which may include a trust or two. You'll pay more if 
you go in for complicated estate planning techniques. Be sure to pick 
carefully. Get referrals, and then interview the candidates. The attorney 
should provide you with an estimate of costs and when the job will be 
completed. You also can ask for an engagement letter that spells out in writing 
what you've agreed to. KATHY M. KRISTOF

JAMES FLANIGAN: TV NETWORKS EVOLVE FROM DINOSAURS TO DARLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Has the future been postponed? It may seem like old times with television 
networks pulling in massive advertising dollars -- along with takeover feelers 
from Time Warner, Disney, Turner Broadcasting and ITT Corp., all of which are 
looking at a price tag of $5 billion and more for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 The new movie, "Quiz Show," looks back to the golden 1950s, when folks 
gathered round the family TV set. And many analysts today are looking in the 
same direction, saying there's nothing like a network -- NBC, CBS, ABC or Fox 
-- for delivering advertising to a mass market. 
</P>
<P>
 Only yesterday, the same networks were regarded as dinosaurs in the age of new 
media. Now, the new age itself is not so sure. At a digital media conference 
organized by Technologic Computer Letter last week, the talk was that 
interactive, 500-channel, do-it-yourself cyberspace will take longer to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, advertisers this summer put up $4.4 billion in advance to buy time 
on network TV in the new season. A 30-second spot on "Home Improvement" -- if 
you could buy a spot on that sold-out show -- would cost you $225,000. The 
numbers are so attractive that Paramount and Warner Bros. are trying to 
organize networks of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Has the future been delayed? No. Technology is moving forward as fast as ever. 
But what has not been recognized is that it may favor TV networks. You have to 
know what to watch for and how to interpret it. 
</P>
<P>
 Think, for example, about the implications of personal computers hooking into 
television sets, as a new Compaq model and IBM's forthcoming Activa home 
computers can. No great technical advance yet; you can watch CNN while working 
on your spreadsheet. But in the future, you'll be able to store programs and 
manipulate televised information in your home computer. 
</P>
<P>
 What about advertising? Everybody is speculating about the future of 
television, but a far more immediate question is the future of advertising, a 
$300-billion worldwide industry. Computerized TV may favor direct marketing, 
which is now a mail and phone-call business, or an adaptation of newspaper 
classified advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Most surprising, the networks may be technology's darling. Signal compression, 
a feature of digital television which is coming in the next four years, could 
allow networks to broadcast three or four separate channels on the frequency 
range that now contains just a single channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, ABC might offer all-sports and all-news channels along with a 
conventional entertainment service. Broadcast networks could offer as much 
variety in one package as several cable channels do now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Networks, after all, are essentially packagers of information," notes William 
Ebeling Jr. of Braxton Associates, a division of the accounting firm Deloitte & 
Touche, which has published a study on the multimedia age. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the bidders for NBC and other networks aware of the technological 
possibilities? Probably. Smart people have been going for networks: Rupert 
Murdoch, who has built the Fox network; cable pioneer Ted Turner; Gerald Levin 
of Time Warner; Disney Studios' Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, smart people also seem ready to sell. General Electric's 
Jack Welch is shopping NBC, and CBS' Laurence Tisch and ABC's principal owner, 
investor Warren Buffett, have shown themselves amenable to deals, too. Buffett 
expressed disenchantment with media investments four years ago, writing that, 
because of increased cable channels and direct mail, "advertising dollars are 
more widely dispersed and the pricing power of ad vendors has diminished." And 
so had the value of media investments, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has made gains of more 
than $2 billion in Cap Cities/ABC stock and retains 20 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 But his point about advertising is borne out by the fact that this year's 
advertiser surge into network TV does not signal a return to the days when soap 
and toothpaste makers Procter & Gamble and Colgate dominated programming with 
massive ad budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Such companies have cut back TV advertising, explains analyst James Dougherty 
of Dean Witter, and now use much of their budgets for promotion deals with 
supermarkets to display their products and coupons and cents-off sales to 
attract customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The world has changed. Consumers today are very price conscious and less 
impressed with brand names and fancy ads than with costs on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the business of "delivering eyeballs to the advertiser," as television 
was once defined, is in transition -- and will evolve further, as "viewers" 
gain even more control through computers over what they watch and when. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising will have to reach such customers one at a time, because they're 
the opposite of a mass market. And that could spell trouble for public 
companies that now lead the advertising industry -- WPP Group, Interpublic, 
Omnicom, Foote Cone & Belding -- if they can't reinvent their business. 
</P>
<P>
 But if ad budgets aren't growing, why the enthusiasm for TV networks? Short 
term, it's based on the fact that the future isn't here yet, and that the old 
model still works occasionally, notes analyst Alan Gottesman of PaineWebber. 
Networks remain the only medium that can reach 61% of America's 94.2-million 
homes in a single broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer term, however, the networks, which are unique in their ability to 
produce and distribute programs through local stations all over the country -- 
and increasingly the world -- are turning into updated versions of traditional 
movie studios. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why it's those very Hollywood studios that are bidding for and 
organizing networks in the new age, where in the 1950s it was the mass 
advertisers along New York's Madison Avenue that engineered the development of 
the TV business. As ever, times change.

YOUR MONEY; LIVE WELL, DIE PREPARED; PERSONAL FINANCE: IT'S INEVITABLE, SO 
HERE'S OUR GUIDE TO ESTATE PLANNING, FUNERALS AND OTHER LIFE-AND-DEATH 
CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody likes to talk about death. But the Grim Reaper eventually comes for us 
all. And when he does, most people are unprepared -- financially speaking, if 
no other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about three in 10 Americans have a will. Less than one in four have 
executed so-called "advance directives" that limit aggressive health treatments 
when the prognosis is terminal. And a far smaller number have moved to 
alleviate tax, probate or funeral costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, as human beings, don't want to deal with our own mortality. So this is 
one of those things that people put off," says Melissa Burkholder, an attorney 
with the American Assn. of Retired Persons in Washington. "The question is 
whether you are going to deal with it, or is somebody going to do it for you? 
And if somebody else does it, are they going to make the same decisions as you 
would have?" 
</P>
<P>
 These are, of course, personal issues that cut to the heart of how you feel 
about your family and about maintaining control. But they are also financial 
issues of sweeping importance. 
</P>
<P>
 What few people realize is that death is shockingly expensive. Funeral costs 
alone easily can amount to $6,000. The cost of probate can wipe out a modest 
estate. Estate taxes can force the liquidation of a family-owned business or 
the sale of the family home. And dying "intestate" -- without a will -- can 
cause your assets to fall into the wrong hands. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not issues solely for the elderly. Having a will and simple estate 
plan is pivotal for young parents, too; their heirs, after all, are more 
dependent on them than are the adult children of elderly couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that many of these issues can be handled easily and 
inexpensively -- if you plan in advance. Here's a six-step guide. Step 1: 
Writing a Will 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing a will is the first step in creating a viable plan that will allow 
your heirs to survive comfortably in your absence. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, a plethora of do-it-yourself wills are completely acceptable. 
The simplest is a handwritten statement that spells out who you are, what 
you've got and who should get it. These so-called "holographic" wills are 
simply signed and dated. No witnesses are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 You also can buy fill-in-the-blanks "statutory" wills at virtually any 
stationery store for $1 to $5. You complete the form, get a few witnesses to 
sign, and either stick it in your safe deposit box or give it to a trusted 
friend or relative for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can buy a will kit. The kits -- either in book form or computer 
software -- cost $10 to $70. Their advantage over statutory wills? They come 
with instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys criticize do-it-yourself wills, noting that an individual can 
make important errors and end up with a will that is not valid. Indeed, if 
you're elderly, wealthy or have a complicated family arrangement -- such as 
children from different marriages -- or complicated desires, you might be wise 
to hire an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if your aims are simple and your assets are modest, advocates of 
do-it-yourself wills say the mistakes are easy to avoid. These are the errors 
to watch for: 
</P>
<P>
 * People forget to have the will witnessed, or they have their heirs serve as 
witnesses. Witnesses are supposed to be able to prove that you were sane and 
uncoerced when you wrote your will. If a witness is also an heir, his or her 
testimony can be questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 * Poor writing. Consider: "I leave all my assets to Suzie, unless she marries 
that jerk, John, and decides to become an artist instead of an accountant." 
Does the author mean to disinherit Suzie if she becomes an artist, or only if 
she both marries John and becomes an artist? If your wishes aren't clear, all 
or part of your will can be invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Not mentioning a child. You may want to disinherit the lazy, 
good-for-nothing freeloaders currently occupying the spare bedrooms. But if you 
simply leave them out of your will, a judge may be persuaded that you suffered 
a memory lapse and forgot to give the freeloaders a rightful share. If you want 
to disinherit someone, say so. Or leave the person a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bequeathing already spoken-for assets. Your will does not control the 
distribution of all your assets. The proceeds of your life insurance policy go 
to the named beneficiary, regardless of what it says in your will. Assets held 
in joint ownership -- houses, cars and bank accounts held by husband and wife, 
for example -- revert to the joint owner on your death. You cannot change the 
beneficiary of these assets in your will. Don't try. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bequeathing for both of you. "We leave all our worldly assets to our 
children. . . ." You can't create a joint will. "You die alone," says Stephen 
Elias, co-author of WillMaker, a popular piece of will-writing software. Step 
2: Understand Probate 
</P>
<P>
 When you die, your assets generally go into a legal limbo called probate. 
</P>
<P>
 The process boils down to this: Your executor hires an attorney who files your 
will with the local probate court. The court sends notice to your creditors 
stating that you have died and that your estate is being settled. Through legal 
hearings, the court pays your debts and "proves" the validity of your will. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit of probate is that once it's through, creditors can't go after 
your heirs for payment of a bill. It also settles disputes between heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The disadvantages of probate are also clear. It is time-consuming and 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The best case -- a simple, uncontested will -- takes about nine months to a 
year to clear probate. In cases where there are disputed creditor's claims or 
infighting among heirs, probate can takeyears. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring a probate attorney, meanwhile, can be costly. They are paid either by 
the hour or according to a formula set by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the statutory fees are levied as a percentage of your gross 
estate (the value of your assets before deducting liabilities, such as mortgage 
loans and creditor's claims). You pay a maximum of 4% of the first $15,000 in 
probated assets; 3% of the next $85,000; 2% of the next $900,000, and 1% of 
amounts over $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are disputed claims or the estate is unusually difficult to probate, 
a judge can award "extraordinary" probate fees, too. And if you don't make 
another arrangement in advance, these maximum fees can be applied to even the 
simplest case, says Doron M. Tisser, a Calabasas-based estate planning 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The executor is entitled to the same fees, but executors who are also heirs 
often don't accept fees. Practically speaking, it's better to inherit the money 
tax free than to collect taxable executor's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 All these fees easily can consume your assets when you die. If your estate 
consists of a $100,000 home, the attorney and executor could claim a total of 
$5,700 in fees. Let's say an $80,000 mortgage has to be paid off. In the end, 
the heirs are left with just $14,300. And if the home is sold, the real estate 
agent's fees would come out of the inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
 Probate also opens your estate to public view. The curious can look up your 
case and determine just how much money you had and who got it. Step 3: Skirting 
Probate 
</P>
<P>
 The time, expense and public nature of probate have spawned an industry whose 
sole purpose is to help people avoid probate. And by far, the most popular 
product in the anti-probate arsenal is the living trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Living trusts are three-part legal documents which, properly executed, set up 
a formula that handles the financial aspects of death and possible incapacity 
without the time, expense and disclosure involved in taking these matters 
through court. 
</P>
<P>
 The first part of the document deals with the distribution of your assets 
while you are sound of both mind and body. This may be as simple as naming 
yourself trustee and giving yourself the right to distribute your assets as you 
see fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Part two names a successor trustee who can handle your financial affairs if 
you fall into a coma or are otherwise rendered incapable of handling them 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Part three serves as a will and provides for the distribution of your assets 
and the appointment of guardians for minor children after you're gone. 
</P>
<P>
 These documents are revocable, which means you can change or cancel them while 
you are alive and competent. They become irrevocable at your death. 
</P>
<P>
 The disadvantages of living trusts? First, they're expensive. An attorney will 
charge $500 to $2,500 to set up a fairly simple one -- but that's still often 
less costly than probate. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, property in a living trust may be a bit more difficult to sell or 
refinance, simply because it's held in the name of the trust. While lenders say 
that's less true today than a few years ago, you still may have problems 
finding one willing to make a home loan on real estate owned by a trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, to be effective, the trust must own all your probatable assets. If it 
doesn't, your heirs could end up dealing with both trust administrators and 
probate authorities, which is more time-consuming and costly than probate 
alone. Since some people don't remember to deed all their assets to the trust, 
many attorneys advise executing a so-called "pour-over" will, which transfers 
any forgotten assets into the trust at your death. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't, however, necessarily need a living trust to avoid probate. All 
those assets that can't be left in a will -- insurance policies, jointly-owned 
property and the like -- automatically skirt probate. You also can name 
beneficiaries for pension plans, brokerage accounts and bank accounts, leaving 
little -- or nothing -- to the probate process. Step 4: Estate Tax Planning 
</P>
<P>
 Few people bother with estate tax planning because it's widely understood that 
estate taxes are assessed only on the "wealthy" -- people with assets of 
$600,000 or more. But, in California, where a modest bungalow in a good ZIP 
Code can sell for more than $500,000, many middle-class families will find at 
least part of their estates falling into the clutches of Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 For the really rich, estate tax gambits aimed at trimming inheritance taxes -- 
which range from 36% to 70% -- are plentiful and complex. But for middle-income 
families with just a shade more than $600,000 in assets, the strategies are 
fairly simple: 
</P>
<P>
 * Annual gifts. Before you die, you can give an unlimited number of people up 
to $10,000 a year without triggering estate or gift taxes, notes Gregg Ritchie, 
partner in the personal financial planning group at KPMG Peat Marwick in Los 
Angeles. In addition, he says, you can pay for a child or grandchild's health 
care or education expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bypass trusts. If you don't like the idea of annual gifts because you're 
worried about having enough money to last you and your spouse's lifetimes, 
consider a bypass trust. These devices help married couples leave up to $1.2 
million to their heirs without triggering estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes called A-B trusts, these documents start out as a revocable trust, 
then split into two parts -- Part A and Part B -- on the first spouse's death. 
</P>
<P>
 The deceased spouse's part -- Part B -- spins off up to $600,000 of the 
couple's combined assets and becomes irrevocable. Eventually, the assets in the 
B trust go to heirs other than the surviving spouse. But while the survivor is 
alive, he or she collects the interest and investment income on the assets. 
When the second spouse dies, both the assets in the B trust and those in the A 
trust go to the designated heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Life insurance. Agents call this the "1% solution," because it involves 
paying 1% of the value of your estate for a period of years to purchase an 
insurance policy. The policy is put into an irrevocable life insurance trust, 
and the proceeds pay estate taxes after you die. 
</P>
<P>
 For how long do you have to ante up 1% of your assets to buy such a policy? 
The answer varies based on your age, assets and insurer. Generally, the younger 
you are, the less you pay, for the simple reason that the insurer is able to 
use your money for a longer period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, paying your money today to save your heirs' from future tax 
obligations makes sense only in some fairly unusual circumstances. This option 
may prove desirable, for instance, if you have a small business that could be 
rendered insolvent or forced into liquidation if your heirs had to pay estate 
taxes on its value within nine months of your death. It also could help if you 
are bequeathing heirlooms or assets that you wouldn't want your heirs to have 
to to sell in order to pay estate taxes. Step 5: Executing an Advance Directive 
</P>
<P>
 They may not have had a lot in common in life. But in death, Richard M. Nixon 
and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis -- who both refused life-prolonging medical 
treatment -- are spurring something of a renaissance in "advance directives." 
</P>
<P>
 These are legal documents that spell out for your doctor the point at which 
treatment should stop, either by stating the specific conditions under which 
you refuse treatment or by designating who can make that decision for you. 
</P>
<P>
 While the most important purpose of an advance directive is to maintain 
control over your life, there is also a financial point to signing such a 
document. Simply put, aggressive, life-prolonging treatments are among the most 
expensive in medicine. Partly as a result, roughly one-quarter of your lifetime 
medical costs are rung up in the final 12 months of life -- and most of that in 
the last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably, cost is incidental when the procedure saves your life and health. 
But what about when treatment keeps you alive yet miserable? If that concept 
frightens you, you may want to draw up an advance directive. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-known is the living will, which stipulates that treatment should not 
be used simply to prolong life when the diagnosis is terminal. Another form is 
a health-care power of attorney, which gives a spouse, child, relative or 
friend the legal right to make life-and-death medical decisions for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Both documents are commonly provided to patients at nursing homes, hospitals, 
hospices and senior centers for nominal charges or for free. They are also sold 
by a variety of national groups and stationery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 However, you don't need a form to execute a viable advance directive, 
according to Charles P. Sabatino, assistant director of the American Bar 
Assn.'s commission on legal problems of the elderly. A letter to your doctor 
stating the conditions under which you'd like to live -- and die -- should 
suffice, he says. However, you should specifically mention under what 
circumstances you would want the doctor to withdraw oxygen, food and hydration 
devices, as these require specific consent in many states. Step 6: Funeral 
Planning 
</P>
<P>
 You won't enjoy it as much, but a funeral can cost as much as a nice wedding 
-- or a luxury car. 
</P>
<P>
 And although many people are reluctant to price-check while grieving, shopping 
around for funeral arrangements can save consumers hundreds -- even thousands 
-- of dollars. It's easy, too, says Lee Norrgard, senior investigative analyst 
with the American Assn. of Retired Persons' consumer affairs division. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law requires funeral directors to provide detailed price information 
on request. The trick is asking the right questions. And that requires some 
thought. Do you want a traditional burial or cremation? A lavish or budget 
farewell? Do religious or personal considerations dictate a choice of funeral 
home or cemetery? 
</P>
<P>
 With those thoughts in mind, create a shopping list like the one printed here. 
Realize that the total cost of a funeral includes more than a dozen elements -- 
many of which are optional. Also realize that burial fees are separate and 
include several components, some of which also involve choices. 
</P>
<P>
 On the funeral side, the biggest cost item is usually the casket. Prices vary 
from about $250 for an inexpensive wood coffin to as much as $25,000 for a 
luxury, bronze coffin with adjustable mattress. There are charges for use of 
the mortuary, services of the funeral director, flowers, music, transportation, 
preparation of the body, embalming, and obtaining permits and death 
certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 At the burial, the biggest cost is the grave, crypt or "niche" for cremated 
remains. With in-ground burials, there is often also a charge for an "outer 
burial container" -- typically a cement casement that goes around the casket; 
fees for opening and closing the grave; a charge for the marker and, possibly, 
recording fees. For cremations, there's often a fee for the urn and for a 
container in which the body is cremated. 
</P>
<P>
 Determine your preferences and call several mortuaries. The cost of an 
identical funeral can vary by as much as $2,000 at different funeral homes in 
the same city, according to an AARP survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "As with any consumer purchase, there is a choice," agrees Susan Daniels, 
spokeswoman for the National Funeral Directors Assn. in Milwaukee. "You can 
choose something expensive or something less expensive." Resources

TORONTO FILM COMPANY GETS 'SOUTHERN EXPOSURE'; ENTERTAINMENT: DEBUTING 
THURSDAY, "DUE SOUTH" WILL BE THE FIRST CANADIAN-PRODUCED SERIES TO APPEAR ON 
AN AMERICAN TELEVISION NETWORK IN PRIME TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cast of the new CBS action-comedy series "Due South" perches precariously 
in a canoe floating, incongruously, in a set built to represent a Chicago sewer 
tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Series co-star Paul Gross and guest star Leslie Nielsen are suited up in the 
red-jacketed ceremonial uniform of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The other 
series co-star, David Marciano, sits in mid-canoe, playing a brash, sarcastic 
Chicago cop. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rapid-pace dialogue of the scene, Marciano's character worries about 
rats in the water, while Gross' frets about scuffing the borrowed boat on the 
sewer wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in 15 seconds, is the central joke in "Due South" -- the cultural 
collision of the naive, ramrod-straight Mountie from the Far North with the 
gritty American urban-scape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due South" was cooked up by former CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky 
and Robert Lantos, chairman of Canada's largest film production and 
distribution company, Alliance Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a landmark here, not only for Alliance, but also for the entire 
Canadian film industry. When "Due South" debuts Thursday it will be the first 
Canadian-produced series to appear on an American network in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Selling a prime-time television series to a U.S. network has pretty well been 
the exclusive domain of a relatively small number of companies, all of which 
are Los Angeles-based," Lantos said in a recent interview. "Reaching that point 
(for Alliance) . . . was something that has been under way a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is only part of a rising American profile for Alliance, a Toronto-based 
diversified entertainment company founded by Lantos in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which went public a year ago, has three more series and 10 
movies-of-the-week in development or production at American networks and cable 
channels, said Michael Weisbarth, senior vice president for television at the 
company's Beverly Hills office. (Alliance also has offices in Montreal, 
Vancouver, Paris and Shannon, Ireland.) 
</P>
<P>
 The company just wrapped up four television movies based on the mega-selling 
Harlequin romance novels published by Toronto-based Torstar Corp., which CBS 
will counter-program to Fox's Sunday NFL broadcasts this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance has an exclusive arrangement with Torstar and envisions a string of 
Harlequin films, eventually repackaged as videos that can be sold next to the 
books at retailers across North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance Releasing, headed by longtime Lantos business associate Victor Loewy, 
is the leading Canadian-owned film distributor here. It recently cut a deal to 
distribute Miramax films in Canada, giving it Canadian rights to Robert 
Altman's upcoming "Pret-a-porter" and Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction," among 
many others. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the company and Miramax will release the Alliance-produced 
"Exotica," written and directed by Atom Egoyan. The film, typical of the 
low-budget, director-driven projects the company long has been associated with, 
made a splash at this year's Cannes Film Festival, winning the International 
Critics Prize. Another Alliance production, "Whale Music," opened the Toronto 
International Film Festival on Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 In partnership with American companies, Alliance is moving into bigger budget 
movies, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnny Mnemonic," a futuristic adventure based on a novel by cyber-fiction 
author William Gibson, is in post-production, and at $23.4 million is the most 
expensive Canadian movie ever made. "Johnny Mnemonic" stars Keanu Reeves and is 
a co-production with TriStar. 
</P>
<P>
 The company recently launched a new division to produce low-cost action movies 
mainly for the cable and video market and in January will go on the air with 
its own cable channel on Canadian television, Showcase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very informal, very high energy, very demanding and very exciting," 
chief operating officer Gord Haines said of the company he joined two years 
ago. "It's like being in the middle of an explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 About the only thing that hasn't exploded is the stock price, which has only 
recently begun to rise after months of staying close to the $13 a share sold at 
offering. Alliance stock closed down 12.5 Friday at $15.625 on the Toronto 
Stock Exchange. Revenue was up 45% for the year ended March 31, with after-tax 
profits of $5.36 million on revenue of $79.56 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Dent of the brokerage firm Wood Gundy Inc., one of the few analysts who 
focus on entertainment companies here, is very high on Alliance and attributes 
the slow rise in the stock price to cautious Canadian investors unfamiliar with 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance is very much the creation of the Hungarian-born Lantos, 45, described 
by "Due South" executive producer Paul Haggis as "a real character, a 
larger-than-life producer." 
</P>
<P>
 Lantos, the company's largest shareholder with a 21% stake, began in the early 
1970s as a distributor and independent producer. Working in a Canadian 
environment dominated by the major American studios, Lantos has prospered by 
pursuing projects eschewed by the studios, by perfecting the art of 
international financing -- mainly through pre-sales to foreign markets -- and 
by building a lattice work of mutually supportive divisions within Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Alliance's distribution rights to movies from Miramax and New 
Line Cinema and to popular European films give it the clout with exhibitors to 
assure screen time for its own productions. Other Canadian film producers have 
a notoriously difficult time getting exhibitors to show their movies rather 
than American films. 
</P>
<P>
 One company division, Alliance Equicap, specializes in arranging production 
financing to take advantage of subsidies and tax breaks offered by many 
countries for films and television meeting national content rules. A movie 
featuring a Canadian writer and producer and a French director and star might 
qualify for subsidies and tax breaks in both countries, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach has been crucial to Alliance, and allows the company to take on 
a personal film like "Exotica," which Egoyan describes as a "perversely 
romantic" movie he made for less than $1.5 million. With its success at Cannes, 
the film is pre-sold to a variety of markets and is profitable before its 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 "The relationship has been very important to me," said Egoyan, who has made 
two films with Alliance. "They've given me access to a higher budget than I was 
used to and a lot of freedom. And they're very adept at selling the films." 
</P>
<P>
 In producing "Exotica" and similar "art films," Alliance keeps a firm grip on 
the budget, generally less than $3 million, and only steps into the creative 
process more or less when asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no point in backing someone with an eccentric vision and then trying 
to interfere with that vision," Lantos said in explaining his philosophy. "I 
don't believe we have ever lost money on one of those director-driven 
low-budget films. . . . We only finance them in part and our investment is on a 
favorable basis, but we've never lost money." 
</P>
<P>
 With "Johnny Mnemonic" and others, Alliance is stepping into a different 
arena, but Lantos argues that the company's approach is similar. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these films is what you would call a mainstream Hollywood movie, 
including 'Johnny Mnemonic,' " he said. But "at that level financially, 
production makes no sense unless there is a significant guaranteed revenue 
coming out of the United States. So we work with the U.S. distributors as 
partners on the more ambitious films, but still we pick the projects that are 
out of the norm." 
</P>
<P>
 Egoyan observed that "what's ultimately interesting about Alliance is that 
it's able to embrace contradictions. They're able to pursue a number of 
different types of projects and give equal attention. I've never felt I've been 
less important to the company than their television work, and yet I know 
television is the financial fuel for the company." 
</P>
<P>
 If Alliance made its way into the film world by backing eccentric little 
visionary films, it took quite a different road to success in television. 
</P>
<P>
 The company entered American television with such late-night fodder as "Night 
Heat," a CBS action-adventure series. (To be fair, Alliance also has long 
produced critically acclaimed series for Canadian television.) And Lantos said 
the hands-off attitude he takes with the director-driven films is the "exact 
opposite" of his approach to television. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance built its credibility with the networks with successful 
movies-of-the-week and miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills-based Weisbarth points to the ratings-successful "Family of 
Strangers," starring Patty Duke and Melissa Gilbert, as an example. The film, 
about an adopted woman searching for her birth mother, was based on a true 
story, but Alliance moved the action from Indiana to the Northwest and filmed 
in Vancouver. Canadians wrote and directed and Canadian William Shatner 
co-starred with Americans Gilbert and Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Due South," Alliance has penetrated what Lantos referred to as the 
innermost concentric circle of the television business, the prime-time series. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the show sticks can't be foretold. But both Lantos and Weisbarth say 
even a quick cancellation would not be fatal to Alliance's future with the U.S. 
networks. There are already too many other projects under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it does get canceled, it would be a disappointment, but not a setback. 
It's maybe two steps forward and one-half step back," Weisbarth said.

OWNERS DENY CHARGES; THE TWO HEADS OF TMI HAVE DIFFERENT VISIONS OF THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA and GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Maurice B. Shuman and James R. Martin bought Teachers Management & 
Investment Corp. in 1987, its prosperity seemed assured. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach company owned $700 million in California real estate and had 
on its payroll hundreds of teachers who had invested in TMI themselves, then 
signed on to moonlight as sales agents for its limited partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, in the booming real estate market of the mid-1980s, it was unthinkable 
that TMI might end up where it is today -- with six of its more than 40 real 
estate partnerships in bankruptcy, investors' funds having lost at least $100 
million of their value, and Shuman and Martin accused in a lawsuit of fraud, 
racketeering and conspiracy, charges that the two men vehemently deny. 
</P>
<P>
 When Shuman and Martin took the reins at TMI, the two men, both accountants, 
were also both experienced investors, having been involved in a variety of 
ventures from gold mines to cattle ranches. The two had complementary 
temperaments too -- Shuman, gregarious and energetic, was the entrepreneur, 
while the reserved Martin was the quintessential accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, now 55, and Shuman, 56, met in the 1960s in Seattle, where both were 
accountants -- Martin with Peat Marwick & Co. and Shuman with Arthur Andersen & 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 An avid fly fisherman and photographer, Shuman grew up in the Northern 
California town of Martinez.  
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Golden Gate College in San Francisco, he joined 
accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Co. He left the company in 1965 to work as an 
independent consultant and put together business deals in Washington and 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman made headlines in the early 1980s when a lawsuit was filed against a 
company he had owned since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in 1980 by the state of Washington's Consumer Protection 
Agency, alleged that Funeral Homes of Washington, a Seattle company that sold 
funeral plots, had failed to abide by a state law requiring that it set aside 
money in a trust fund for people who had prearranged purchase of cemetery 
plots. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ordered Shuman to pay $200,000 in restitution and prohibited him 
from selling funeral plots again, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman said last week that the company had financial difficulties that 
surfaced only after he acquired it. And he portrayed the court decision as "a 
different interpretation of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 After that venture, Shuman moved to Southern California. In the mid-1980s, he 
said, he sold oil and gas limited partnerships. State Department of 
Corporations records show that he was also president of half a dozen small 
companies based in Newport Beach. Among them was N.B. Equities apartment 
complex in San Diego and at least three fishing boat ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who grew up in Seattle, took a more conservative route. After 
graduating from the University of Washington with a law degree, he went to New 
York University for a master's degree. He joined Peat Marwick in Seattle, later 
transferring to the firm's Newport Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, after 20 years with the accounting firm, Martin retired to 
concentrate on his personal investments, which included beef cattle and a wine 
importing venture. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI was not the first joint venture by Shuman and Martin. The two went 
together in 1980 to buy four scallop fishing boats that they sold in 1985. They 
were also investors in a Nevada gold mine that went bust, Shuman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But steering TMI out of its troubles may prove to be their toughest challenge 
yet, and the two do not necessarily agree on the best way to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked in a recent interview if the company will still exist in five 
years, Martin immediately replied, "Absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman, however, took a different view: "I think we're winding down," he said.

TRACKING THE KILLER BEES; AS THE FABLED AFRICANIZED HONEYBEES MAKE THEIR WAY 
TOWARD CALIFORNIA, A FEW MEN HAVE BEEN PATROLLING THE FRONT LINES OF THE 
INVASION: THE BEE COWBOYS OF SOUTH TEXAS.

By KEVIN COOK, Journalist Kevin Cook lives in Huntington Beach, where he plans 
to protect his wife, Pamela, and son, Cal, from the killer bees when they 
arrive.

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. 83 is a crooked line in the Rio Grande Valley. Hawks ride heat currents 
over the road. The chirr of dog-day cicadas, summer insects that solicit sex by 
rattling sheets of skin under their bellies, gives August afternoons a sound 
like the sizzle on a grill. Highway 83 runs north and west near Brownsville, 
paralleling the big river to the south. A poster on a phone pole reads "Buy 
your life insurance now! The killer bees are here." 
</P>
<P>
 Weslaco, a hot, flat town with a population of 26,000, straddles the highway 
between Brownsville and Laredo. Here in the toe tip of Texas, a clutch of 
cinder-block buildings shimmers in 100-degree heat. This is the Texas 
Agricultural Experiment Station, an outpost of the United States Honeybee 
Management Program, which started doing "killer bee" research in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in Weslaco doing research for a book on pest control. Like everyone 
else, I had heard tall tales about superbees at the border. I went to the Rio 
Grande Valley three years ago because that was where the insects were entering 
the United States. It is the only part of the country where killer bees are an 
established fact of life, a regional hazard like scorpions and hurricanes. I 
knew that what happened in Texas -- widespread fear, occasional stingings, 
bee-safety programs in schools -- was coming soon to other Sun Belt states. 
(The bees have now entered California; they should reach Los Angeles next 
year.)  
</P>
<P>
 From my first encounter with the bees and the people who hunt them to my most 
recent chat with a Texas bee specialist, the level of panic there has died 
down. That seems to be the pattern of this invasion: initial frenzy followed by 
something close to normalcy. Only Texans have lived with the bees long enough 
to reach that point, however. For others in the Southwest, bee problems lie 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians can learn from government scientists stationed in Texas as well 
as from regular folks who have adapted to the bees and now view them with 
respect rather than terror. But the ones who know the most are the few 
government workers who are the grunts in this battle, the ones who have manned 
the front lines since the bees came north. These men are the ones who know what 
happens when the first wave of killer bees arrives. They're the hands-on 
experts in their field -- the hard-bitten and hard-stung "bee cowboys" of South 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 On my first day in the Rio Grande Valley, I found Jim Sopczyk and Waylon 
Chandler in the parking lot behind the Ag Station, disputing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sopczyk and Chandler were apiary inspectors. Such men ordinarily check 
commercial beehives for parasitic mites and diseases like foulbrood. But when 
the first Africanized bees (so called because their progenitors were imported 
from Africa to Brazil) entered the United States four years ago, Sopczyk and 
Chandler became bee killers. Sopczyk, 44, is moon-faced, with windblown hair 
the color of honey. That day he wore his usual expression, that of a man whose 
tongue tastes like a lemon. Chandler, 74 years old, is tall and leathery, with 
short gray hair and silver-framed spectacles that mirror the sun. He took a fat 
burlap sack from the bed of his pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "African?" Sopczyk asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler nodded. "They looked African to me. They sounded African, so I killed 
'em as African." He upended the sack. About 3,000 crisp dead bees spilled out. 
They smelled vaguely sweet, piling up like Cracker Jack. 
</P>
<P>
 Africanized "killer" bees look like any other bees. This batch could not be 
officially identified, Sopczyk told me, until he sent a few to a USDA lab that 
was open for business 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There, entomologists 
would use microscopes to confirm what Waylon Chandler claimed he already knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "African bees take off with a noise like a fiddle, a fiddle tuning up," he 
said. "My daddy played the fiddle, so I know." 
</P>
<P>
 Sopczyk knew it was scientifically impossible to identify bees by ear. Still, 
he could not dispute his partner's folk wisdom. Sopczyk lost the upper range of 
his hearing 25 years ago, flying helicopters in Vietnam. "I don't know, 
Waylon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zzzz!" Chandler's face lit up. "That's the sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Weslaco's bee cowboys were macho men who always worked in their shirt sleeves. 
They both owned bee suits -- hooded white overalls outfitted with face screens 
called veils -- but the Rio Grande Valley was too hot for such gear, and they 
were too proud. Bee suits were fine for the scientists stationed here, but 
Sopczyk and Chandler, who had each been stung hundreds of times, figured that 
real men didn't wear veils. 
</P>
<P>
 They were both longtime beekeepers, which is to say bee lovers. They didn't 
enjoy exterminating killer bees, tough little critters whose main crime was a 
fierce talent for survival. They took the job to help defend Texans as well as 
Texas' $11-million-plus beekeeping industry, which relies on gentle domestic 
bees -- the "European" kind -- to make honey and pollinate crops. Productive 
domestic hives were being infiltrated by invaders from the south, feral insects 
that were far less eager to serve mankind. 
</P>
<P>
 Sopczyk and Chandler knew that the invaders were not superbees. Like other 
bees, they die when they sting, and their stingers dispense no more venom than 
those of other bees. But it is also true that while a threatened colony of 
Eurobees might sting an intruder a dozen times, pursuing him for 100 yards, a 
killer colony stings en masse and may chase its victims for a mile. "We've been 
lucky so far," Sopczyk said. So far, only one American has died under a blanket 
of the new bees. It happened last year when a valley rancher, Lino Lopez, took 
a torch to a feral colony. The bees' stings, combined with the elderly Lopez's 
panic, stopped his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked the bee men why there hadn't been more deaths. They had a four fold 
answer. One, the Rio Grande Valley, the first part of the United States to be 
invaded, was too sparsely populated to furnish many human targets. Two, the war 
had just begun; the early '90s were a prologue, with billions of bad bees still 
to come. Three, those Weslaco cowboys, Chandler and Sopczyk, probably scared a 
lot of bees away. And four, luck. Killer bees may respond to threats 
explosively, but they don't fly very fast, with a top speed of 15 miles per 
hour. Escaping is as easy as fleeing from the "Frankenstein" movie monster: 
You'll be fine as long as you don't trip and twist your ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nodding at the mound of dead bees in Chandler's truck, Sopczyk alluded to the 
new bees' reproductive talent. "That's 12 swarms we won't have to deal with 
next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve times 2,500, the number of individuals in a small swarm, is 30,000. By 
killing this swarm, Chandler short-circuited the process and prevented the 
birth of several million bees a few years hence. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, Chandler answered a call from a scared citizen. He fired up his 
truck and drove west on U.S. 83, past cotton fields and green rows of sugar 
cane to Roma, Tex., population 8,000. At that moment, there were as many bees 
on a single tree branch in Roma as there were people in the town. Hanging from 
a mesquite tree, the Roma swarm was a clump of bees that held one queen, a 
small coterie of male drones and a few thousand female workers. Chandler killed 
them with laundry soap. 
</P>
<P>
 Why soap? Entomologists tested many poisons on captive bees. Their experiments 
had some poignancy: Wooden crosses served as the bees' Golgotha. "Each hive's 
queen was placed in a wooden cage and taped to the center of the cross to serve 
as a clustering site," a researcher reported. One poison "produced a slow 
death, and immobilized honeybees lay twisting in a mass for about 30 minutes." 
One insecticide, resmethrin, killed some bees but merely dispersed others. 
(Sopczyk, who has used resmethrin, says it "really roars them up, makes them 
come out of a wall like darts. They're dead, but they don't know it yet.") But 
for Chandler and Sopczyk, the best apicide was plain old detergent. Liquid Tide 
slicked the bugs' breathing tubes, allowing the soapy water to enter their 
bodies. The bees drowned.  
</P>
<P>
 Chandler bagged his dead swarm and trucked it back to Weslaco. He parked 
behind the Ag Station, where Sopczyk and I met him. The bee men joked about an 
endorsement deal: They wouldn't mind appearing on packages of Tide, like the 
ballplayers on Wheaties boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 One live bee crawled among the dead in the bed of Chandler's truck. She was a 
worker. Almost all bees are workers, and all workers are female. Each colony 
includes a few males, the stingless drones whose sole function is to mate once 
with a queen, but the society of bees needs far more workers. Workers forage 
for nectar, fly that precious food to the hive and turn it into honey. They 
feed the queen and drones, insects so specialized for reproduction that they do 
not feed themselves. Workers defend and clean the hive and air-condition it 
with the beating of their wings. They work until they die and are cleaned from 
the hive by other workers. 
</P>
<P>
 This one's frayed wings betrayed her dotage. She was about a month old. 
Sopczyk picked her up by the wings. He showed her to me and said, "Here's how 
you take a stinger out." He jabbed the bee butt-first into the soft flesh of 
his wrist. "Don't pull it. Scrape it out. There's a venom sac attached to the 
stinger; if you pull it, you'll pump more venom into your arm," he said. 
Dropping the bee, he popped the stinger out with an expert flick of his 
thumbnail. 
</P>
<P>
 His demo bee crawled zigzags on the tarmac at his feet. Inches away, her 
disembodied stinger throbbed microscopically as the venom sac contracted, 
pumping poison. It would continue to cramp for about a minute and might outlive 
the rest of the bee. She had shot her wad, to use a sexually incorrect phrase. 
A worker's stinger, which is barbed to catch and hold an enemy's skin, plucks 
out her entrails in the act of stinging. Disemboweled, she dies for her kin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim, you killed my one live bee," Chandler drawled.  
</P>
<P>
 "Did you want that one?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah, it's OK. I got the queen." Chandler held the Roma queen, which was 
floating in alcohol in a four-inch plastic bottle. She was half again a 
worker's size, striped black and gold like a cheerleader's skirt. A few days 
earlier, driven by an idea the poet-essayist Maurice Maeterlinck called "the 
genius of the race," this jumbo bee with a brain the size of a pencil point had 
drawn her thousands from their mother hive into the skies of south Texas. Her 
swarm was a slowly flying cluster of bees searching for a dark, safe place to 
hide. 
</P>
<P>
 Befitting her station in life, the queen lived longer than the rest. A 
pampered egg machine fed and groomed by 10 generations of her sisters and 
daughters, she may have been 5 years old. She lived longest even when the U.S. 
Honeybee Management Program came calling, but Chandler's soap was too much for 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "African," he said, holding her up for Sopczyk to see. The queen was not noble 
or dreadful. She was not much of a queen anymore, just a bug. 
</P>
<P>
 If you were a Texas bee inspector in the early years of the invasion, this is 
some of what you learned about Africanized bees: In 1956 a Brazilian 
entomologist, Warwick Kerr, brought queen bees from South Africa to his 
laboratory in Brazil. Kerr admired the African honeybee, which is called AHB in 
scientific literature. Compared to the European breed (EHB), the African 
subspecies works harder to turn nectar and pollen into honey, and to turn honey 
into more and more bees. AHBs had to work hard: They evolved in a region where 
food is scarce, life cruel and brief. Of course they sting like demons, too -- 
another result of their harsh habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Biology provides a chemical trigger for their temper. When a bee stings, 
glands attached to its stinger release alarm pheromone, a substance that angers 
other bees and marks the stung foe as a target. AHBs release more alarm 
pheromone than EHBs and are more sensitive to its scent. While a European sting 
might incite a dozen more, an AHB sting tends to start a riot of stinging. One 
USDA study counted 1,500 stings in a target exposed for 60 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr hoped to tame the Africanized bees by crossing them with EHBs. He wanted 
to create a better bee, a hybrid that would make Brazil the world's leading 
honey producer. Instead, 26 of his imported queens slipped out of his 
experimental hives and escaped into the jungle. Their progeny doubled and 
redoubled their numbers, sometimes by literally enslaving EHB colonies. If 
threatened, they dispatched thousands of worker-fighters in an instant. They 
have been called abejas bravas and abejas asesinas -- "assassins . " 
</P>
<P>
 Moving northward through South and Central America, they killed hundreds of 
people and thousands of animals. Horses and dogs were particularly at risk 
because they were often tied and could not escape. By 1989, the bees were in 
Mexico, just south of the Rio Grande. American officials tried to quell public 
fears. Killer bees were not nearly as bad as other dangers, they said. The 
average American was more likely to be hit by lightning or bitten by a 
rattlesnake than stung by AHBs. Still, as one bee hunter observed dryly, 
"Rattlesnakes don't fly." 
</P>
<P>
 The odds did not help Inn Siang Ooi, a University of Miami graduate student 
who took a field trip to Costa Rica in 1986. He stepped in a crack just inside 
a cave, disturbing a feral colony, and from the frightful moment when he knew 
his foot was stuck until long after he was dead, he was stung almost 8,000 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1990, the bees entered Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Collins, research leader of the honeybee unit of the USDA's Agricultural 
Research Service in Weslaco, told me that AHBs are a minimal threat to public 
health. She is more worried about their economic impact. "It's an 
attention-grabbing subject, and the words used by the media -- killer bees! -- 
play on the fears people have of insects, so we do have to deal with the idea 
of this giant bee that's gonna come down and carry kids away," Collins said. 
"That's not reality. Yes, we'll have stingings, but the United States has an 
excellent emergency health-care system, and we will coexist with these bees. 
But there's another concern here. Africanized bees could disrupt beekeeping, 
and therefore American agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins frets about the billions of dollars' worth of groceries the EHBs help 
produce each year -- crops that constitute a third of the American diet. If 
Kerr's bees upset the partnership of pollinating EHBs and Southwest farmers and 
orchardmen, the result could be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Collins collected AHB semen for injection into EHB queens, hoping 
to accelerate the hybridization of the two breeds. Success might mean the 
protection of $800 million in crops that EHBs pollinate annually in Texas, and 
ultimately the defense of a major sector of U.S. agriculture. "As a geneticist, 
that would really appeal to me," she said. It would mean she had created the 
new, better bee that Warwick Kerr had meant to make. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Weslaco office sat Collins' colleague from Texas A & M University, 
Frank Eischen. A long-faced, gray-bearded man dressed in a white work shirt, 
jeans and cowboy boots, he looked like Freud at a rodeo. On his door was a 
cartoon showing an angry nest of killer bees; under the nest was Winnie the 
Pooh, keeled over dead. The new bees are "tough," Eischen said. "They've been 
challenged by nature, quite vigorously, and survived." Along with Collins, his 
boss, he was launching a program that entailed raising Africanized colonies in 
Texas, "for research purposes only, and with strict safeguards" to prevent 
their escape. I asked whether he worried that his safeguards, like Kerr's, 
might fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "That shouldn't happen, but it is my nightmare," Eischen said. "A pretty 
little girl gets stung, or worse -- a pretty little girl who's the daughter of 
someone important." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back in Brazil, Warwick Kerr was busy with experiments on a rare 
breed of bee that cannot sting. In 1991, a proud, barely chastened Kerr told 
the New Yorker's Wallace White of his many awards and his satisfaction with his 
career. Would he change anything if he could? "I would leave those African bees 
where I found them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Sopczyk climbed out of his blue Chevy pickup truck into triple-digit heat. 
Looking grumpy, as usual, he squinted at a stucco apartment block, a pair of 
rusted sedans, a tricycle, a rooster chasing a hen under wash lines hung with 
laundry. He ambled around the block, peering up through sparse branches, and 
found what he was looking for in a desert willow. A clump of long, slender 
insects buzzed around a papery nest the size and color of a softball. "False 
alarm," he said. "It's wasps." 
</P>
<P>
 Sopczyk trudged to his truck. He returned carrying a Sears Craftsman leaf 
blower. Switching the blower's control to reverse, yanking its starter, he 
aimed it at the wasps. With a thwop, the nest disappeared down the leaf 
blower's barrel. He waved the barrel in the air, collecting stragglers, then 
touched it to the ground, sucking up a pound or more of dirt, burying the wasps 
inside the machine. "That'll do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were five apiary inspectors in Texas, but only the two based at Weslaco, 
Sopczyk and his partner Chandler, were primarily bee killers. Chandler was a 
canny old lifer, while Sopczyk, at 44, was "the youngster," as Chandler put it. 
The youngster made no effort to hide his disdain for his bosses, the "paper 
pushers" the government had sent here, but he liked the regular folks of the 
valley so much that he changed the pronunciation of his name to suit them. 
Texans had trouble seeing Sopczyk and saying "Sop-chik," so he became Subject. 
Everyone called him Jim Subject. The business card he handed you when your bees 
were dead in the yard read "Jim Sopczyk (Subject), Apiary Inspector." 
</P>
<P>
 Regular folks were scared. They thought anything that flew, crawled or buzzed 
was a killer bee. Sopczyk saved a terrified woman from what she said were brown 
killer bees crawling up her porch. "Lady, those are ants," he said. A man 
called Weslaco to say he'd seen the bees tearing branches from trees. A priest 
heard a buzz in his rectory wall; calling for help, he said, "I'm sorry, but I 
don't do exorcisms." 
</P>
<P>
 There were real alarms as well. Sopczyk chased bees that were on a cherry 
picker at a construction site, where a swarm had clustered near a welder. He 
killed AHBs in irrigation culverts, doghouses, a choir loft and an oil derrick. 
One swarm had taken over a mothballed copying machine and begun merrily turning 
out honey. 
</P>
<P>
 He often visited homes where the bees had built honeycombs in wall voids. 
Unless there were mice around to feast on the comb after Sopczyk did his job, 
homeowners might soon be treated to a strange sight: the dead colony's honey, 
no longer cooled by workers' wings, melting through cracks in the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, bee trouble always has to do with protecting honey. 
</P>
<P>
 Plants offer nectar, a sweet liquid, to bees in exchange for pollination 
services. Worker bees collecting nectar inadvertently gather pollen on their 
bodies and take it to other flowers, allowing plants to reproduce. The colors 
and patterns of flowers, so cherished by lovers and poets, are actually 
advertisements for bees -- enticing signals to the 12,000 eyes in a bee's head. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a new apple tree or flower bed, a worker bee hurries home to her 
sisters. Her agitation alerts them to the good news she brings. The intricate 
gyre she performs in the pitch-dark hive -- quickly copied by her kin, passed 
from body to body in a humming mass -- relays her news. As she dances, the 
worker imparts the location of her discovery in terms of the sun's position. If 
her find was sunward from the hive, she moves directly up the honeycomb. If it 
was in the opposite direction, she moves straight down. Angles to the left or 
right indicate other directions with perfect precision. Distance is told by the 
speed of her dance. The level of her agitation, ranging from mild to feverish, 
tells the richness of the food source. This is the way that worker bees make 
maps, shouting their good fortune by dancing in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 EHB and AHB workers dance the same way. Africanized bees, however, are readier 
to defend themselves and their honey, the hive's only fuel. Their history holds 
the reason: Unlike the pampered bugs of Europe and America, AHBs evolved in a 
cruel African habitat. They fought predators as though their survival was at 
stake every day, which it was.  
</P>
<P>
 In Weslaco, Sopczyk grabbed the phone. He spent a minute calming a worried 
taxpayer. "No, it's probably wasps. If the nest is small, and you're only 
seeing a few. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 His voice wasn't the only sound in the room. Sopczyk's office hummed with the 
insistent white noise of trapped bees. Atop a rank of file cabinets were 23 
coffee cans he had commandeered from trash baskets in the Ag Station. Bees flew 
inside the cans. They bounced audibly off the wire mesh taped to the cans' open 
ends, their buzz a shade more shrill than that of free honeybees. These were 
angry, frustrated insects. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his next wasp chase, Sopczyk took time to explain his canned bees. The 
diameter of a coffee can, he said, neatly matched the mouth of his leaf blower. 
So he would cut the bottom off an empty can, making a tube, then tape wire mesh 
over one end. The can now plugged into the leaf blower's barrel like a silencer 
on a gun, with the screened end inside the barrel. By switching the blower to 
reverse, he could sample killer bees. "They fly by that barrel and make a quick 
turn. Pop!" After catching 10 to 20 workers, he would fit the can's lid onto 
its outward end, trapping them. Then he could kill the rest of the bees and 
bring his sample back to Weslaco. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no invention is perfect. The gas-powered blower could run for nine 
minutes. "One time, a real spicy colony, I thought I was going to run out of 
gas before I ran out of bees," he said. With no time to fetch his soap sprayer, 
he kept filling coffee cans until there were too few bees to kill him. After 
that he never forgot to top off the blower's gas tank before work. 
</P>
<P>
 The cans in Sopczyk's office would not hum for long. Every few days he left 
some of them in a freezer overnight. Doubly trapped now, the bees would briefly 
form a tight ball to share body heat -- their instinctive response to cold 
weather -- before they died. If the bees had been involved in a serious 
stinging incident, he dropped a few of them into plastic specimen bottles and 
sent them Airborne Express to a government lab in Beltsville, Md. As for the 
frozen dead that were not sent to Beltsville, AHBs and EHBs alike went into the 
trash, sharing space as they never did in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Again the phone buzzed. "This is Jim Subject," he said. "OK, how many do you 
see?" 
</P>
<P>
 Waylon Chandler ambled into the room. He gave his partner a quick salute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stay there. Not too close. I'll be right out," Sopczyk said. Hanging up, he 
looked at Chandler. "This guy wants to know what we're gonna do about all these 
bees." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, Jim, I think we should kill them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sopczyk drove west on Texas 107. He zigged onto a dirt road that led to a 
gravel drive that led to a hackberry tree, where a large swarm had come to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleazar Zamora lived in a brick house the color of a Folgers coffee can. 
Zamora, a welder who had come home from work to keep an eye on his children, 
popped out of the house when Sopczyk arrived. "I was scared the kids would 
bother the bees," he said. He was also worried for his mother, who watched 
wide-eyed from a window in a long white trailer next door, firing questions in 
Spanish. Her son replied in English, "It's OK, it's OK, it's OK." He showed 
Sopczyk the bees. They were eight feet up in the hackberry, which spread its 
dry branches between the trailer and a blue Camaro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably African," Sopczyk said. "Good bees don't swarm much this time of 
year." He said they might stay overnight, maybe two nights, and then move on. 
But if the workers kept scouting the area without finding a better home, they 
might build a nest here. That meant honey, eggs and larvae, which the bees 
would fight for. "Then they'd go after anything that bugged them -- a lawn 
mower, a car engine, a kid throwing rocks." 
</P>
<P>
 The swarm was the size of a bowling ball and contained about 4,000 bees. Its 
mother colony had grown so large, the queen's pheromonal messages could not 
pass easily among so many bees, so it was time to swarm, to make two colonies 
from one. Workers now fed a protein-rich substance, royal jelly, to an ordinary 
larva, creating a new queen. Other workers seized the old queen. Pushing and 
biting, they forced her to the hive's entrance. She was carried along with 
thousands of her sisters as the swarm burst from the nest and flew in tight 
formation around her, finally pausing in Eleazar Zamora's yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The swarm was silent. The buzzing of bees is the sound of their wings beating, 
but wings weren't needed now. These bees were content to crawl among each 
other, protecting and warming their queen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sopczyk used his leaf blower to fill a coffee can, reaching up to whisk a 
dozen bees from the clump. The rest of the swarm did not object. He went to the 
truck for his soap sprayer. It was a Chapin poly tank, hard blue plastic with a 
1.3-gallon tank, the sort of sprayer gardeners use to kill aphids. The tank 
held an inch of Liquid Tide. Sopczyk found a garden hose by the house. He 
filled the tank and pumped up the pressure by hand, pressing the pump's handle 
until it moved like a spoon in cold honey. He squeezed the sprayer's trigger. 
Sudsy water shot 20 feet, a jet of bubbles in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want to see how they feel?" he asked me. 
</P>
<P>
 I followed his gaze. "How the bees feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You can touch them. They won't sting," he said with a twist of his lip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably." 
</P>
<P>
 It was tempting. I knew that swarms were far less dangerous than established 
colonies. But AHB swarms had been known to turn killer in no time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sopczyk stood by with his poison Tide. He would protect me. The risk was 
dozens of stings, not thousands. Still, thinking of boyhood stings, the fiery 
bite of one stinger in my bare foot, I looked for a reason to keep my hands in 
my pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're up too high," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora stole that excuse by dragging a cement block to the tree. Sopczyk 
nodded his approval. I stood on the block and reached up. I expected the swarm 
to feel rough, all those stingers as prickly as cactus spines, but the bees' 
stingers were sheathed now; I was no imminent threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The swarm was warm to the touch. It was soft, a living beanbag calmly rustling 
under my fingertips. I probed the bee ball, moving my fingers into and under 
its surface. The bees made room for me. Soon my hand was part of the swarm. 
Collins had told me that swarming bees could be gentle as lambs, but these were 
gentler. A lamb flees a stranger's hand. This swarm accepted my hand, 
incorporated it, moved and breathed under and between my fingers, gentle as a 
swarm of killer bees. I parted from them reluctantly when Sopczyk said it was 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want to spray them?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, thanks." 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora and I flinched when Sopczyk's spray hit the bees. They dropped off the 
cluster in chunks. Finally Sopczyk sprayed the last chunk. It fell, and then he 
stomped it dead, 100 or so bees, including the queen. 
</P>
<P>
 There were dozens of bees in the air. They flew drunkenly, heavy-winged and 
poisoned. A worker landed on my shirt. She crawled to my shoulder where I could 
see her up close. She was trying to clean her eyes. She scraped with quick 
mechanical strokes, her forelegs moving like windshield wipers, until one leg 
tapped one lens or a small group of them -- the most clouded or painful, it 
seemed to me -- with special worry for a moment before the robot impulse 
reasserted itself and her legs worked again in failed concert all over her 
eyes. Before long, she tumbled down my sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 IN 38 YEARS, THE OFF-spring of Warwick Kerr's handful of queen bees have 
colonized two continents, 20 nations and more than 6 million square miles. 
There are perhaps a trillion of them south of the border, many millions in 
Texas, and soon there will be millions in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Africanized bees were detected in Yuma, Ariz., three miles from 
the California border. A few have been detected in Imperial County, with 
Riverside and San Diego counties next on the list. They will colonize Los 
Angeles soon, perhaps by next summer. Local schoolchildren can see bee-safety 
videos on Channel 58, and the Los Angeles County Fire Department has ordered 
1,000 bee suits. Unfortunately, because of complex regulations, the best 
pesticide is against the rules here. Using laundry soap to kill bees currently 
violates California law. Individual states must specifically allow a particular 
poison to be used on a particular pest; using soap on aphids, for instance, is 
perfectly legal in California, but the state has yet to officially allow soap 
on bees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll use foam," said a Fire Department spokesman, apparently unaware of what 
Texans have learned: Foam from fire extinguishers angers the bees without 
hurting them very much. That's why, when a feral colony of a couple thousand 
AHBs hitchhiked from Guatemala to Los Angeles on a cargo ship in July, it took 
hooded, veiled government workers 90 minutes to kill them -- a job Sopczyk 
could have done in five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows what will happen when AHBs swarm Los Angeles County. Elba 
Quintero, national coordinator of the USDA's Africanized Honeybee Program, 
advises caution but not fear. "It is OK for people in California to be 
concerned, to be more aware of bees," Quintero says, "but they shouldn't be 
scared. They should remember that we have had Africanized bees in this country 
for four years now, and only one person has died." 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as Aug. 23, however, Christopher Graves was stung 1,000 times in 
Robstown, Tex., just north of the Valley. He survived. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Africanized bees are not really much of a threat to public health. 
Still, they change the lives of people who encounter them. Frank Eischen, the 
biologist and bee admirer, now packs a syringe and a dose of adrenaline, the 
bee venom antidote, in his first aid kit. "You can't be too careful," he says. 
Eischen thanks his lucky stars for one thing: The research project he and Anita 
Collins launched hasn't backfired. Not one of their bees has escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 More important in the scientists' view, however, are three other recent 
discoveries. The first is geographic: As wild AHBs move farther north, "they're 
running out of steam," says Eischen. He suspects that North America's chilly 
climate will finally stop the bees cold; they may never claim much territory 
north of Los Angeles, Dallas and Atlanta. A second positive sign is that AHBs 
seem to be susceptible to a common parasitic mite called varroa, which might 
also slow their northward advance. 
</P>
<P>
 A third new development is more ominous. It shows what talented survivors AHBs 
can be. In her lab, Weslaco science chief Collins has seen Africanized queens 
developing faster than their European counterparts. The difference may be only 
a few hours, but timing is all that matters in the wild. When a colony needs a 
new queen, workers feed royal jelly to many larvae -- the white worms growing 
in the hive's wax incubators -- but only the quickest survives. Upon hatching, 
she kills all other royal larvae, her potential rivals, before settling down to 
produce millions of eggs of her own kind. By hatching first, one AHB larva (the 
result of one mating among the dozen or so the previous EHB queen may have had) 
can turn a tame hive into a killer bee assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 AS THE BEES MOVED -- north from the Rio Grande Valley toward Houston, apiary 
inspector Waylon Chandler followed them. Sopczyk's old partner now stands 
sentinel in Jasper County near the Louisiana border. His job is to catch and 
sample swarms in order to help scientists track AHBs' progress -- though he 
would surely recognize them by their sound. "There's not any here yet," 
Chandler says, "but I'm looking out for them. Some beekeepers are about to 
throw up their hands and quit. Other people here don't know what to think, but 
they'll be as excitable as folks in the valley once those bad bees get here -- 
excitable like the bees." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Sopczyk stayed in the Valley. Soon after he wiped out the swarm on 
Zamora's property, he killed 10,000 AHBs attached to a trailer in Santa Rosa, 
Tex. They dished out more than 200 stings to the trailer's owner before she 
escaped. But Sopczyk bent a rule. Apiary inspectors are allowed to kill any 
bees they find in the open and were encouraged to call in licensed 
exterminators to kill bees inside or attached to someone's home. "A 
technicality," he sniffed. "If there are people around who might get stung, I'm 
going to do my job." After the Santa Rosa job, he was cautioned by Paul 
Jackson, the state's chief inspector, who said Sopczyk had screwed up, "rashly 
killing" killer bees. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reaction to that was 'Go to hell,' " said Sopczyk. Soon Jackson, who was 
short on payroll funds -- and who had already been irritated when Sopczyk spoke 
freely to a reporter -- offered Sopczyk a transfer to San Antonio: 19 hours a 
week with a cut in pay. Sopczyk said no. But though he still had his leaf 
blower and soap sprayer, as a private citizen he could kill bees only in his 
own back yard. "I finally found something I'm good at, and they won't let me do 
it. I can't do anything," he said, shortly after, "because I'm not an 
exterminator." 
</P>
<P>
 So he read books and took tests until he became a licensed exterminator, and 
today Sopczyk is president, serviceman and janitor for his own pest-control 
firm, Associated Critter Control. "I'm out there struggling, getting about a 
third of my work from bees."  
</P>
<P>
 As Sopczyk's "nasty little she-devils" move north and west into California, it 
is worth remembering that Apis mellifera isn't the only adaptable species. In 
Brazil, beekeepers have learned caution: They now approach their AHB hives with 
veils and thick gloves, and Brazil's honey production -- thanks to hard-working 
Africanized bees -- is much higher than ever before. In fact, the story will 
probably be the same here. Early panic will be followed by a transitional 
period, a territorial war between humans and bees. The war will be followed in 
turn by a tense coexistence -- an uneasy truce between two deadly species, them 
and us.

PARANOIDS, GHOSTS AND THE DISAPPEARED; IT WAS CERTAINLY MEXICO'S FREEST 
ELECTION EVER, BUT FOR ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S LEADING NOVELISTS, A LONGTIME PRI 
FOE WHO SERVED AS A POLL OBSERVER FOR AN OPPOSITION PARTY, IT WAS POLITICS AS 
USUAL -- PRI POLITICS, CORRUPT, INTIMIDATING, ETERNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pablo Ignacio Taibo II, Paco Ignacio Taibo II is a Mexico City-based mystery 
writer. His most recent book is Four Hands (St. Martin's Press). This article 
was translated by Lorenza Munoz. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I once exchanged definitions of the word paranoid with my friend, mystery 
writer Andreu Martin. He said a paranoid is essentially a citizen who has 
common sense; I added that a paranoid Mexican is someone who is sure he is 
being followed and about to get screwed, and he is right. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the way I feel. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what we are. 
</P>
<P>
 We are citizens chased by ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
 The election that will be held in five days is the most important since 
Francisco Madero fought to overthrow Porfirio Diaz in 1910 -- the elections 
that sparked the Mexican Revolution. Already blood has been shed -- 147 people 
have died in Chiapas, the original candidate of the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party was assassinated in March. The PRI has been in power 1929, 
65 years now, changing only names and faces. They have prepared for this 
election since 1988, when a coalition of small parties joined to support 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and won. The electoral fraud that kept Cardenas from power 
generated a strong popular resistence that lasted a couple of years. Now, 
Cardenas is back. 
</P>
<P>
 I travel in the first seat on the election campaign bus with Cardenas, this 
peculiar figure who has become the moral symbol of the stubborn opposition in 
Mexico, the candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, the PRD. In front 
of us stand the never-ending pine forests of the countryside. He is on his way 
to a campaign stop where he will meet with almost 10,000 peasants who came down 
from Sierras Negra and Zacapoaxtla.  
</P>
<P>
 During the last three weeks, he has attracted large crowds wherever he goes. 
Since a tumultuous showing at the University of Mexico and Mexico City's 
bullring at the end of July, he draws feverish, even anxious, multitudes 
wherever he passes. He has summed up the dissidence against the all-powerful 
political system of the one-party state. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you see the upcoming election?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be long elections," he answers. "One day to vote but many more to 
defend the vote. There is an enormous fraud in place. It has been prepared for 
months." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think you can win?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to raise an avalanche of votes to bury the fraud. Will it be possible 
to raise a tide of votes to annul the fraud?" This he asks himself. 
</P>
<P>
 I return to the back of the bus. I feel like Wyatt Earp in the OK Corral -- 
alone with my doubts and my brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 I try to stick my nose into the huge kitchen where they are cooking the 
electoral fraud. It's not easy. It's a different edition of the same show, but 
now the forms are guarded, appearances are under scrutiny. The name of the film 
is "Honey, I Shrunk the Frauds." The fraud is there but cannot be seen. But the 
dwarfs populate our streets. They appear in all of our conversations, they 
slide through our daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days until the elections. We are eating at my father's home in Mexico 
City. He is a journalist and a democrat, and he says in a whisper: "We have an 
insurrection in the kitchen. One of the maids is going to vote for the PRI." 
</P>
<P>
 Paloma, my wife, gets angry. Everything is backward. The poor people vote for 
their executioners! Paloma asks her: "Cande, who will you vote for?" 
</P>
<P>
 The girl is overwhelmed with shyness. She lives in a small town in the state 
of Mexico, one hour and a half away by bus. She was taught to read in my 
parents' home by my friend Susana a few months ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can vote for whomever you want."  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's just that the mayor of my town told us that if we don't vote for 
the PRI, we would be thrown in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 "So, who will you vote for?" 
</P>
<P>
 "For the PRI." 
</P>
<P>
 I flee from the conversation with my hands on my head. 
</P>
<P>
 I have become familiar with threats like that. In Oaxaca, an army major told 
the organizer of a rural cooperative to be careful because he could end up in 
an early grave. The real horror came when "they" spread the gossip that voting 
credentials include a photo so they can be used to discover whom you vote for. 
It is absurd, but . . . . Vultures flying over our weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not end there. 
</P>
<P>
 A new word has been incorporated into the national electoral language: shaved. 
It means "erased from the voting lists." Rumors of people being shaved abound. 
Samuel del Villar, representative of the PRD to the Federal Electoral 
Institute, the agency in charge of the elections, announced the existence of 
half a million cases in which "suspicious" citizens, mostly young people, had 
applied for their credential to vote but had not received it. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Dominguez paints naive art -- defeated angels, magicians surrounded by 
serpents and birds. He holds the brush and complains that although he has 
visited the electoral institute offices 11 times, his credential never arrived. 
Because of his persistence, an official told him, in confidence and with shame, 
that he was one of those missing from the electoral lists, that in the Valley 
of Mexico an estimated 500,000 people, mainly students, professionals and 
peasants (the sectors the government found to be less reliable), had been 
banished. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if this is true. In a land full of lies, God treats us to rumors. 
The point is that Daniel will not be able to vote in these elections, left only 
with an apologetic letter from the authorities. He will save it as testimony to 
the humiliation. There is no consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 IT IS RAINING. IN THESE LAST FEW DAYS, RAIN PERSISTENTLY ACCOMPANIES Mexico 
City. It is dirty rain, contaminated, rain that stains white clothes hanging 
out to dry and descends from black clouds gathering in the corners of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a Cardenista rock concert in Coyoacan and I am chosen to read a text 
between performances by Botellita de Jerez and La Santa Sabina, two of the most 
popular bands in the nation. Cardenas will close the event. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge, bright yellow tent covers part of the town plaza. The rain flows off 
and on for three hours. About 5,000 kids attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelist Juan Hernandez Luna, who accompanies me, gives a brief description of 
the varieties of Cardenismo. Several groups and social sectors with extremely 
different interests have come together under Cardenas. A few days before, he 
was in Tlaxcala among the poorest peasants in the country, and today amid punks 
and preppy kids, young radicals and rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cardenas is the sum of all the offenses," Hernandez Luna tells me. All kinds 
of people feel that the Mexican state has hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
 We sit in silence, listening to a song by Botellita de Jerez that grabs our 
soul. It is a song about the Virgin of Guadalupe: "Virgin of the disappeared, 
Virgin of the destitute, come with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Will it be possible to win the election? 
</P>
<P>
 IN MEXICO, WE LIVE WITHIN A WELL-DIRECTED LEGAL SYSTEM, PROgrammed to 
liquidate the opponent. The legal impediment to forming coalitions, which 
deprived Cardenas of support from one of the mini-parties that formed part of 
his Frente '88, is a rule that smaller parties must register their own 
candidate or else lose their registration. This is one legal venom. 
</P>
<P>
 Denying Mexicans living out of the country the right to vote is another. We 
remain one of the few countries in the world that does not allow our citizens 
to vote at consulates and embassies. But taking away the vote of Mexicans 
living in the United States has a logic -- the government does not want to give 
the vote to those it cannot control. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen million invisible beings, from Los Angeles and Chicago to Ft. Worth 
and Santa Fe, contemplate us. 
</P>
<P>
 OF ALL THE DIRTY STORIES, THERE IS ONE THAT PARTICULARLY IRRITATES me. Banners 
and signs from the Workers Party are everywhere. There are so many that they 
create suspicion. Where did they get the money? Their dues are a tenth that of 
the PRD, and Cardenas' campaign is truly poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Their candidate is Cecilia Soto. Previously a worker for Lyndon LaRouche, 
later an elected official with the PARM (a small party, almost marginal) and, 
finally, one day before her nomination, a member of the Workers Party. She is 
there to take leftist votes away from Cardenas.  
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the party's funding, she responds: "We have saved our money," 
causing expressions of stupor among the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone, whose name I promised to conceal, told me in April that a state 
agency gave the party money to construct a bridge over a river that does not 
exist and that the money was funneled directly to the campaign. That same 
person said this was but one of many similar "distributions." I do not know if 
this is true. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MEN OF THE SYSTEM, WHO ONE MINUTE ARE PUBLIC OFFICIALS, THE next minute 
militant Priistas and at the same time industrialists and financiers, change 
character behind the stage: dragon masks, Santa Claus sacks and beards, shawls 
from Manila and Armani ties. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is called "From Here to Eternity." 
</P>
<P>
 The players are transvestites of power. They sell each other public 
industries, exchange lovers, dine with narco-millionaires, organize electoral 
fraud, construct roads on land they bought the day before, deprive peasants, 
create heirs, reorganize the future. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe in something, something that has allowed them to remain at the 
top since 1929 as they transformed themselves from revolutionary generals to 
attorneys who would rule over the old generals to degree-holders in economics 
from American universities. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe in eternity. 
</P>
<P>
 They have not even learned the lesson from lemming Soviet bureaucrats -- that 
political eternity does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what I think, that is what I would like to believe, but the myths 
transcend the men. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those of us who believe this country will not enter the 20th Century 
until it is freed from the last corrupt remnants of Priismo have been infected 
by this sensation of chameleonesque immutability. 
</P>
<P>
 Could they be eternal? 
</P>
<P>
 All of my adolescent and adult life, I have lived under Priista governments. 
Somewhat sinister, somewhat corrupt, always authoritarian, always fraudulent. 
In 1968, I participated in the student movement; I was a union organizer in the 
'70s, a journalist in the '80s; I worked in an investigative center dependent 
on the Department of Labor and at the Office of Publications of the Secretary 
of Public Education. 
</P>
<P>
 I know the monster. 
</P>
<P>
 Are these sons of bitches eternal? 
</P>
<P>
 THE PRE-ELECTION FRAUD IS DIRECTED AT CARDENAS. HE IS, OUT OF ALL the 
opposition candidates, the one who obsesses the men in power. He is the only 
one who can put them in jail for the thousand-and-one types of acts of 
corruption they have committed. The other candidates will negotiate. It is 
possible to negotiate with the other party, the conservative National Action 
Party, PAN, whose candidate, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, is jokingly referred 
to in Mexico as the Squirrel (because he "wanders through Los Pinos" -- the 
Pines, a clear allusion to the presidential residence). A pact can be formed 
with Diego because, in the last three years, he has made not very clean deals 
in the conflict-ridden regional elections of Guanajuato, Chihuahua and Baja 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cardenas is the subject of the Priistas' nightmares. Because, among other 
things, he beat them in '88. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is 60 years old, the child of the only president 
remembered lovingly by the people. He has the name of the last Aztec emperor, 
who led the resistance against the Spanish conquerors, and a face of strong 
mestizo features. An anti-charismatic leader with quiet speech, an enemy of 
phrases, accused by friend and foe of aloofness or shyness. A man who came from 
the system (he was senator and governor of Michoacan during his Priista days), 
obsessively dedicated to a democratic rupture with the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher of all dissidence, concentrator of all hatred, seen by millions as the 
corrector of all injustices.  
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas' program, which groups together an enormous array of political 
proposals from the center-left to the most radicalized movement of neighborhood 
organizations, is supported by the majority of intellectuals, progressive 
Christians, social democrats, ecologists, small industrialists, honest 
ex-officials. It is relatively simple: End the corruption, rechannel the funds 
toward education and the countryside, open up the mass media . . . not much 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Too much.  
</P>
<P>
 THE MOMENT OF GLORY FOR THE CARDENAS MOBILIZATION OCCURRED eight days before 
the elections and somehow it established the scale with which to measure the 
illusions and the fears, those of the populist democrats and those of Panistas 
and Priistas.  
</P>
<P>
 In my home, we spent two hours the previous night discussing the size of the 
Zocalo, Mexico City's main plaza -- how many people fit, if there was a need 
for half a million citizens to completely fill it. It almost became a cause for 
divorce or fratricide. We were speaking of the emblematic plaza, the heart of 
darkness, the symbolic center of power for Mexican society. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza of buried Aztec pyramids, its royal cathedral sinking in the swampy 
subsoil, it was the central flag post of the motherland, presidential palace 
and gathering point for all demonstrations for the past 26 years, since the 
student insurgency in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 The easy symbols are there. The walls of Aztec skulls, the memories of student 
repressions and the lines of citizens buying bonds to pay for the petroleum 
expropriation in the 1930s. The presidential seat that Villa and Zapata did not 
want.  
</P>
<P>
 All three major candidates had announced public meetings in the Zocalo that 
weekend: Cardenas on Saturday morning, Diego and his Panistas in the afternoon; 
Ernesto Zedillo and the PRI's transported crowds, forced to attend, on Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The multitudes called on the multitudes. The Cardenista bastion arrived on 
Saturday morning -- a varied mix of the urban middle class, the generation of 
'68 and their children; university professors, teachers and doctors and women 
in their 50s from the periphery of the Distrito Federal, the central part of 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zocalo was bursting with people, not only the central platform, but the 
side streets as well. Even the scaffolding the PRI had placed for its meeting, 
still lacking the boards to stand on, was filled with people. The Zocalo had 
never been as full as this.  
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas made his key speech there. A speech about government. Simple: We will 
return to the lost legality, we will reconstruct the republic for the citizens, 
we will achieve democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 We left the Zocalo in human streams praying to Tlaloc, the Aztec rain god, to 
ruin the Panista act that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 With a base of support from the upper middle class, much less militant, the 
PAN could not accomplish a concentration of people similar to the PRD. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the PRI demonstrated its strength and its weakness in filling the 
Zocalo. Many stories have spread of how bored citizens tried to leave but were 
blocked by groups of armed security guards; of how unions forced their workers 
to attend, punishing those who did not obey by docking them three days' salary 
and offering one day of vacation to those who did; stories of taxi drivers 
threatened with the loss of their license plates; communities blackmailed with 
promises that public works would not be completed if they were not registered 
on the attendance list at the Zocalo; public vendors threatened with losing 
their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRI filled the Zocalo, but using the old customary methods. Even so, the 
Zocalo showed a few empty spaces.  
</P>
<P>
 Symbolically, Cardenismo had won. That is what we told ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 BUT BENEATH THE PRI'S above-ground mobilization there was a subterranean one 
formed by a state secretary and a government program called Solidaridad. 
Created to convert a state obligation into a negotiable charity, Solidaridad 
had been generously handing out public moneys to buy votes, blackmail and apply 
pressure across the country: 
</P>
<P>
 Solidaridad officials asked for the Priista vote while they gave away 
mattresses in the Distrito Federal; they handed out irons in Colonia Escandon, 
raffled refrigerators in Mixcoac. They offered to pave roads in Veracruz, 
threatened to deny irrigation projects in isolated communities in Tabasco and 
handed out water tanks in Saltillo. They threatened to end work on public 
projects in Puebla if the community vote did not go for the PRI. Like a 
diabolical magician-king, the state, to force the Priista vote, would give and 
take bonds for tortillas, illusions, powdered milk, hope, schools, tractors, 
dreams. My friend Margarita tells me that in the zone of La Villa, to the north 
of Mexico City, voters were offered about $30 if they deposited a PRI-marked 
ballot. Public moneys turned to Priista votes. Massive vote-buying mechanisms 
for Mexicans turned helpless by their misery. Birds of prey, vultures flying 
over our hunger and our weaknesses.

<P>
 DURING THIS LAST MONTH, the debate on homonyms has inundated the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that an unusual number of homonyms -- citizens with the same 
first name and the same two surnames -- were found on the electoral lists. 
</P>
<P>
 I read the complaints of the PRD and learned of the electoral authority's 
refusal to run a computer program to verify names or to cross-check 
fingerprints and photo IDs to see if the homonyms were real or were actually 
Priistas with four or five photo IDs falsely registered in different towns. The 
homonyms surpassed a million in the electoral listings of the Valley of Mexico, 
an average that skyrocketed above that found in the telephone directory. Nobody 
can convince me these are real. Nobody can convince me that a legion of Priista 
ghosts, voting in different booths, does not exist. People of the same name and 
different addresses, protagonists in another variant of fraud, nowadays 
immeasurable. 
</P>
<P>
 NONETHELESS, SOMETHING has been gained in the electoral campaign. In a society 
characterized by the way the state controls the media, cracks have appeared. 
The government hands out concessions to radio and television chains, and these 
concessions operate like favors, to be paid back in other ways. The majority of 
newspapers survive only with governmental money given under the table in black 
envelopes; that is easily verifiable in at least three of the national dailies 
(Excelsior, El Dia, Uno Mas Uno). 
</P>
<P>
 In this paradise of control, a legion of young journalists is rejecting 
pressures and bribes, telling the stories. Sometimes the headline and the story 
are contradictory. Censorship has been cracked open. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is something to be proud of -- how these young colleagues with 
miserable salaries resist the envelope, the pressure, and tell their stories, 
try to evade control, how they pressure the system. 
</P>
<P>
 My great uncle, spiritual guide of my voyages through journalism, told me one 
day that this is a profession where the heroic and the contemptible meet. He 
was right once again. 
</P>
<P>
 ON ELECTION SUNDAY, I ARrive, still groggy, at the booth I am to monitor in 
Colonia Condesa, an upper-middle-class area in the center of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 I am one of the many citizens representing a party who are manning balloting 
places to observe the voting in the Valley of Mexico and elsewhere in the 
country. We are sure that this will help stop the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 I am, of course, representing PRD. I have two sandwiches, one huge Coke and 
the firm conviction that, in my corner at least, blatant fraud will not 
triumph. There is little I can do against the pre-election fraud: I don't have 
the means to detect electoral phantasms so I am a slave to the electoral 
listings that the authorities have placed in my hands. 
</P>
<P>
 I encounter the same attitude in other officials and opposition party 
representatives. For me, in this middle-class neighborhood, it is a routine 
election day, full of tension. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the first hour of the voting, young people come in with their photo IDs 
but their names do not appear on the lists. We send them to the special voting 
precincts created especially to resolve these supposed "extraordinary" cases. 
They return protesting because they were not allowed to vote there either: The 
precincts had run out of ballots; policemen and soldiers had voted there 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows how many are suffering this same last aggression? 
</P>
<P>
 Toward 11 p.m., we finish counting the ballots. In my precinct, the PAN wins, 
with the PRI close behind and Cardenismo a distant third. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the night, with added hours of exhaustion, I run to district 
committees, campaign centers, early press conferences. The trend is clear: The 
PRI will win the election with more than 40% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Did they beat us? Did the fear of change dominate society? Or did we lose to a 
combination of pre-election fraud (buying of votes, shaving the lists, 
threats), institutionalized fraud (no votes outside of Mexico, elimination of 
coalitions, information control) and election day fraud (electoral ghosts, 
final shaving of the lists, electronic tricks, ballot thefts)? 
</P>
<P>
 How much did manipulation of electoral listings affect the final numbers? Who 
could measure the bought vote? Who were the ghosts? Who were the missing? 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have won under legal conditions and without playing dirty? 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 WITH THE FIRST ELECTION results at our back -- PRI candidate Zedillo won with 
almost 50% of the vote and Cardenismo drew less than 20% -- we head for a 
meeting called by the PRD. 
</P>
<P>
 We gather in the public square, the heart of our darkness, the unoccupied 
ceremonial center in Mexico City, once again the Zocalo. Overinflated clouds 
are disturbed only by the flight of doves, the usual helicopter hovers above us 
and the rabid chanting of the multitudes repeats in chorus the name of 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. Today is the 22nd of August. The day after. 
</P>
<P>
 Faces of defeat, sadness, massacred hope. Were we dreamers who thought the 
avalanche of the popular vote could destroy fraud, trapped by a sophisticated 
machine that guards appearances like never before and annuls the democratic 
game? 
</P>
<P>
 In the Zocalo, Cardenas has the decency to declare himself neither the winner 
nor the loser. He refuses to dance the terrible waltz of figures that the state 
has orchestrated. Not triumphant, but not defeated. Who won? Who knows? The 
multitude radicalizes, disillusionment becomes anger, anger creates anger. When 
the PRD candidate calls for a gathering the following Saturday, he is only 
echoing the slogan that comes from the bottom and tells him: "Mobilize." From 
the microphone, Cardenas produces one of his most memorable phrases: "If they 
could not count us in the ballot boxes, let them count us in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 In the next weeks, maybe months, more information about the fraud will emerge, 
from small towns, from journalists, from people inside the government who will 
tell the inside stories. 
</P>
<P>
 What will happen? 
</P>
<P>
 Social tension is increasing in the country, in the southern zones of 
Veracruz, Tabasco, Guerrero, Oaxaca. News of fraud will be gasoline on the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the PRI has proven that it is stronger than we expected. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not very easy to have a cool mind when it is filled with anger.  
</P>
<P>
 I am 45 years old, and I do not have a commitment only to victory. I did not 
want to be an official of a democratic regime; I am just a citizen enlisted in 
the infantry. My illusions are mine, my nightmares are mine. Change is not 
around the corner, or maybe it is, but the road is long once again. The owners 
of this country, the owners of power, will not convince me, nor will they 
defeat me. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what I tell myself as I take my wife and my daughter's hands and 
introduce myself into the crowd.

 War. Mighty tobacco against the U.S. surgeon general, the Food and Drug 
Administration, federal and state and local politicians, the media, the 
no-smoking crusaders, lawyers for dead and dying cigarette smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacks against cigarette makers grew more ferocious this year. Tobacco's 
skeletons popped out monthly in media exposes and in testimony before Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman's congressional committee hearings. Politicians papered the 
nation with proposed legislation to ban smoking here, there and everywhere. 
More recent, more ominous, is the FDA Drug Abuse Advisory Committee's 
conclusion that cigarettes could be classified as a drug because of nicotine. 
That decision is crucial if the FDA decides to regulate tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
 Government control of nicotine alone portends a death rattle for tobacco's 
allure. At stake is $45.3 billion a year in cigarette sales and 2.3 million 
tobacco-dependent jobs. Understandably, cigarette makers dare not weaken. They 
must doggedly defend the smoke they sell. And money is their shield, their 
weapon. With it, they reward the friendly and savage the enemy through a legion 
of scientists, lawyers, publicists and lobbyists. Their approach is nothing 
new. It was conceived in 1953 during a similar anti-smoking frenzy -- so far, 
it has worked. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is a keyhole peek into the genesis, reasoning and execution of 
tobacco's strategy these 40 years. The story is told by the participants 
themselves through excerpts drawn from confidential notes, memos and letters 
never intended for public rummaging. We focus on the decade before and the 
decade following the 1964 U.S. surgeon seneral's report that concluded that 
smoking can kill. STRATEGY 
</P>
<P>
 It is 1953. New scientific studies have connected cigarettes to lung disease. 
America has awakened to the dangers of smoking. Scientists have begun to expose 
the connections between cigarettes and lung disease. Shaken by unrelenting bad 
press and declining tobacco stocks, the chief executive officers of six leading 
cigarette makers -- American Tobacco Co., R. J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, Benson 
& Hedges, U.S. Tobacco Co. and Brown & Williamson -- agreed that "drastic 
action" was necessary. They held a historic secret meeting Dec. 15, 1953, in 
New York City with John Hill, a founder of Hill & Knowlton, the world-class 
public-relations firm. Their mission was to plan tobacco's counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . before the current health crisis arose, cigarette manufacturers never 
met together at any time except at dinners honoring some industry leader. 
(Tobacco should) sponsor a public relations campaign which is positive in 
nature and is entirely 'pro-cigarettes.' The current plans are for Hill & 
Knowlton to serve as the operating agency of the companies, hiring all the 
staff and disbursing all funds." (Hill & Knowlton memo, Dec. 15, 1953.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is one of extreme delicacy. There is much at stake . . . . 
There is nothing the manufacturers can say or refrain from saying that can stop 
people from being interested in their health, nor allay their fear of cancer. 
So long as the causes and cure of this dread disease remain unknown, people 
will be subject to waves of fear regarding it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should create a committee with 'research' in the title so that the public 
recognize the existence of weighty scientific views which hold there is no 
proof that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer . . . . The underlying 
purpose of any activity at this stage should be reassurance of the public . . . 
. this project would explore such questions as: Why do mice show no tendency to 
develop lung cancer in experiments where they live half their lives in smoke 
filled chambers? Why has the rise in lung cancer been most marked among men, 
although the greatest rise in the use of cigarettes in the last 25 years seems 
to have been among women? What are the benefits and enjoyment derived from 
smoking . . . ? What are the smoking habits of long-lived distinguished public 
leaders? What are the human ills erroneously attributed to tobacco over the 
centuries?" (Hill & Knowlton memo to cigarette executives, Dec. 24, 1953.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette manufacturers followed Hill & Knowlton's advice. They formed the 
Tobacco Industry Research Committee in January, 1954, with a first-year budget 
of $1.2 million and supported by 23 Hill & Knowlton employees. STOP THE PRESSES 
</P>
<P>
 The Tobacco Industry Research Committee's media blitz began with a two-page 
advertisement: "A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers," which appeared Jan. 5, 
1954, in 448 newspapers with a cumulative circulation of 43 million. The ad was 
followed in April with "A Scientific Perspective on the Cigarette Controversy," 
a booklet quoting 36 scientists questioning smoking's link to health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 " (The booklet) was sent to 176,800 doctors, general practitioners and 
specialists . . . (plus) deans of medical and dental colleges . . . a press 
distribution of 15,000 . . . 114 key publishers and media heads . . . . days in 
advance, key press, network, wire services and columnist contacts were alerted 
by phone and in person . . . and . . . hand-delivered (with) special placement 
to media in Los Angeles, Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C. 
The story was carried by hundreds of papers and radio stations throughout the 
country . . . . staff-written stories (were) developed with the help of Hill & 
Knowlton, Inc. field offices." (Hill & Knowlton memo, May 3, 1954.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposed Argosy piece, by Dick Reddy, is now scheduled for the August 
issue and the latest revision we have seen in proof form shows that it will be 
an extremely positive piece." (May 25, 1955.) 
</P>
<P>
 Next, a June press conference introduced the committee's new scientific 
director, Dr. Clarence Cook Little, a cancer researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 " (The press conference) was covered by Dave Garroway's NBC-TV program, Today. 
Delos Smith, UP Science Editor, filed a very complete story of 600 words. AP 
filed two stories, one 80 words and the other 120 words . . . . AP radio to 
1,400 stations . . . UP-Movietonews to 80 some TV stations; MGM-Telenews to 80 
some TV stations . . . ." (Hill & Knowlton memo, June 18, 1954.) 
</P>
<P>
 " (The research committee) now has the basis needed for carrying on a 
long-range plan of public relations . . . establishing the (research committee) 
in the public mind as a constructive force in scientific research . . . . 
research should be carried forth on . . . current scientific opinion holding 
that no case has been proved against tobacco . . . . how the public is carried 
away by over-simplified reading of scientific experiments." (Hill & Knowlton 
memo, June 21, 1954.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the industry has been bedeviled by sensational headlines generated 
often by publicity seeking researchers . . . the trend is beginning to turn . . 
. . The bulk of editorial comment now appearing approves and, at times, 
applauds the action of the industry . . . . Advance knowledge was obtained of a 
story on smoking by Bob Considine for Cosmopolitan Magazine. Information was 
supplied resulting in seven revisions . . . to the story which was already in 
type. . . . One negatively aimed program (WNBT) . . . was postponed after 
discussion (with us). Another TV program (ABC-TV, Martin Agronsky) . . . ended 
on a favorable note after conferences (with us) . . . . Assistance was provided 
to the New York Times for a Sunday magazine piece . . . . Special conferences 
are held with AP, UP and INS science writers." (Hill & Knowlton secret memo, 
July 17, 1954.) 
</P>
<P>
 Hill & Knowlton documents describe sit-down sessions with the New York Times, 
AP, UP, INS, Coronet magazine, the New Yorker, New York Post, Time, Newsweek, 
U.S. News & World Report, Business Week, Cosmopolitan, the New York Daily News, 
the New York World Telegram & Sun, Real magazine, Redbook, Bluebook, Harper's, 
Look Magazine, Life and Reader's Digest. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an Oct. 7, 1954, memo, TIRC researchers pitched tobacco's case in 
private meetings with Arthur Hays Sulzberger, president and publisher, New York 
Times; William Randolph Hearst Jr., president and publisher, Hearst 
Consolidated Publications; Mrs. Helen Rogers Reid, chairman of the board, New 
York Herald Tribune; Jack Howard, president, Scripps-Howard Newspapers, and Roy 
E. Larsen, president, Luce Publications. Hill & Knowlton reported that the 
publishers felt that "the sessions had been most helpful in clarifying the 
Tobacco Industry Research Committee program." 
</P>
<P>
 " (We have compiled) a cross indexed card file . . . on medical and scientific 
papers regarding smoking and health . . . in some 2,500 medical journals . . . 
. a cross indexed card file on medical opinions . . . as noted in press, radio 
and other popular media is compiled . . . ." (Hill & Knowlton report, 
"considered highly confidential . . . . no additional copies be made . . . this 
copy not be placed in files," Aug. 17, 1954.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco's strategy was reflected in newspaper headlines: "Lung Cancers Found 
in Non-Smoking Nuns," "Air Pollution Blamed for Lung Cancer," "New Survey 
Disputes Tobacco-Cancer Link," "Finnish Doctor Challenges Cigaret-Heart Ill 
Link," "Lung Cancer Linked To Auto Exhaust," "Japanese Research Finds No Link 
Between Lung Cancer, Cigarettes," "Heavy Smokers With Low Mortality," "Cigaret 
Theory of Cancer Hit," "Three Scientists Raise Questions About Cigarette-Cancer 
Theory." 
</P>
<P>
 Research committee publicists nurtured such pro-smoking articles as "Go Ahead 
and Smoke Moderately" in Pageant magazine; "Phony Lung Cancer Scare," in People 
Today; "Who Says Smoking Gives Men Lung Cancer?" and "Smoke Without Fear," 
published by True magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first big scare continues on the wane . . . . the lynching party seems to 
have been called off, at least temporarily. Treatment of the cigarette-health 
issue in public media continues to improve from the Tobacco Industry Research 
Committee's point of view. Even adverse stories now tend to carry modifying 
statements. Positive stories are on the ascendancy . . . . The research program 
. . . has won wide acceptance in the scientific world as a sincere, valuable 
and scientific effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other side of the ledger . . . . Anti-tobacco crusaders continue to 
ride the health issue." (Hill & Knowlton memo, April 28, 1955.) TOBACCO 
SHUDDERS 
</P>
<P>
 Then the other shoe dropped. In 1960, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Luther L. Terry 
announced the "need for a new look . . . that smoking has adverse health 
effects." A committee that Terry formed in 1962 delivered its report in 
January, 1964, and forever changed the country's view toward cigarettes. 
Drawing on studies of 1.2-million smokers and thousands of animals exposed to 
tobacco, the 387-page report declared that smoking can cause cancer of the 
mouth, larynx, esophagus and lung, plus chronic bronchitis, emphysema, heart 
disease, stunted babies and other ills. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee was reorganized, expanded 
and renamed the Council for Tobacco Research (CTR). 
</P>
<P>
 Hill & Knowlton ended its relationship with the council in 1968. "The Council 
for Tobacco Research has served no public relations function since that time," 
says Dr. James F. Glenn, who is currently chief executive officer of the CTR. 
</P>
<P>
 To date the council has handed out $242 million in research grants to 
institutions in 44 states and 12 countries. Among them were Harvard, Dartmouth, 
MIT, Rutgers, Columbia, Cornell, Yale, Notre Dame, Stanford, USC, the 
University of Texas, Houston, and six schools in the University of California 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1964 surgeon general's report, the research council began recruiting 
and funding scientists to debunk anti-smoking research. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . the industry must somehow find a way to make an effective technical 
rebuttal to the arguments of the anti-cigarette forces. Only in this way will 
the present burden be lifted from us. . . . Our philosophy is not to start a 
war, but if war comes, we aim to fight well and to win." (Philip Morris 
internal memo, Oct. 28, 1964.) 
</P>
<P>
 " (The Council for Tobacco Research is) the best and cheapest insurance the 
tobacco industry can buy and without it the Industry would have to invent (it) 
or would be dead." (CTR official's handwritten note, mid '60s.) 
</P>
<P>
 " (The Council for Tobacco Research) provides (the tobacco industry) with its 
own scientific experts who may also serve as scientific spokesmen . . . (to) 
disprove the allegations that smoking is a primary etiological factor in some 
diseases . . . . If we are satisfied . . . we could encourage its publication." 
(CTR memo, Oct. 18, 1965.)  
</P>
<P>
 Favorable studies were summarized in the research council's annual reports 
until 1976 and publicized in press releases. Here is a representative sample: 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer: 
</P>
<P>
 " (Test) results lend little to support the hypothesis that cigarette smoke 
can act as a direct contact carcinogen in the human lung." (CTR annual report, 
1964-65.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Association between lung cancer and smoking is 'incomplete.' " (CTR annual 
report, 1965-66.) 
</P>
<P>
 " (The increase in lung cancer) has been exaggerated considerably by the 
progressively increasing skill of clinicians in diagnosis . . . leading to 
overdiagnosis." (CTR annual report, 1966-67.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Many experiments . . . have failed completely to produce lung tumors . . . 
with cigarette smoke . . . in lungs of ducks, hamsters and mice." (CTR annual 
report, 1968-69.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Vital statistics for the past 15 years do not show a significant rise in 
reported cases of bladder cancer. Hence, the reported statistical association 
(between smoking and bladder cancer) has lacked rational explanation." (CTR 
annual report, 1968-69.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Heart Disease and Hypertension: "Persons who stopped smoking showed 
significantly LESS cardiovascular disease incidence than those who had never 
smoked at all." (CTR annual report, 1964-65.) 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . studies suggest that the physiological act of eating sugar prevents the 
cardiac effects of smoking." (Research council scientists' abstract, 1964.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabbits or hens . . . did not show any convincing differences in the 
condition of their arteries if given nicotine regularly." (CTR annual report, 
1964-65.) 
</P>
<P>
 "An entirely unexpected finding was the higher prevalence of coronary heart 
disease among non-smokers than among ex-smokers, a paradox which casts doubt 
upon the alleged role of smoking in the genesis of coronary heart disease." 
(Research council scientists' abstract, 1965-66.) 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been reports claiming a relationship between smoking and 
hypertension, but, paradoxically, it has been found that men who are heavy 
smokers generally have lower blood pressure than non-smokers." (CTR annual 
report, 1968-69.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnancy: "A significant question that remains unanswered is whether the 
decreased birth weight of infants born to smokers is detrimental." (Research 
council scientists' abstract, 1965-66.) 
</P>
<P>
 "While this report clearly indicates that nicotine modifies uterine function 
in the rat . . . the authors emphasize that the results cannot be extrapolated 
to women who smoke." (Research council scientists' abstract, 1978.) SMOKERS DO 
IT BETTER 
</P>
<P>
 Nicotine. The bottom line.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need to stress the benefits that sixty million smokers derive from the use 
of our products." (Philip Morris memo, February, 1971.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Nicotine stimulates the learning process, more particularly among the animals 
that are originally relatively slow learners." (CTR annual report, 1966-67.) 
</P>
<P>
 "In short, the chronic administration of nicotine appeared to stimulate the 
brains of the rats, making the animals function more effectively." (CTR annual 
report, 1970-71.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Without nicotine . . . there would be no smoking. No one has ever become a 
cigarette smoker by smoking cigarettes without nicotine. Smoke is beyond 
question the most optimized vehicle of nicotine and the cigarette the most 
optimized dispenser of smoke. Think of the cigarette pack as a storage 
container for a day's supply of nicotine. Think of the cigarette as a . . . 
dose unit of nicotine." (Confidential Report, Research Council Conference, St. 
Martin Island, the Caribbean, 1972.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Habitual smokers proved more efficient and better able to sustain performance 
when they smoked than when they did not." (Research council scientists' 
abstract, 1975.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Under (nicotine's) influence there is greater retention of learning . . . . 
It would appear to be the perfect tranquilizer. (Research council scientists' 
abstract, 1977.) BLAME THE SMOKER 
</P>
<P>
 Research committee scientists scavenged other explanations for smoking's 
growing disrepute.  
</P>
<P>
 ". . . inherited or genetic make-up causes predisposition to smoking and lung 
cancer. To prove this is the industry's best hope." (Handwritten council memo, 
March 21, 1975.) 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . A number of factors . . . that differ in smokers and nonsmokers and may 
be predictors of early heart and artery disease. Still another researcher has 
found a significant difference in basic brain wave patterns of smokers and 
nonsmokers." (CTR annual report, 1968-69.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Heavy smokers are characterized by features of: defiance, impulsiveness, 
danger seeking, neurotic lability, and oral preoccu- pation . . . . 
relationships with their fathers were more disturbed." (Research council 
scientists' abstract, 1970.) 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . heredity and smoking probably contribute about equally to the 
likelihood of developing (lung) disease." (Research council scientists' 
abstract, 1970.) HUH? 
</P>
<P>
 "The earlier death of those that smoked more and those that smoked cigarettes 
was due to the fact that they were born later and lived at a time when there 
was more smoking, rather than because smoking was life-shortening . . . . 
Individuals die essentially at a single point in time, one cannot precisely 
measure the effect of smoking on longevity since the probability of a given 
individual being a cigarette smoker or non-smoker is related to the birth 
year!" (CTR annual report, 1970-71.) DON'T TREAD ON ME 
</P>
<P>
 Punch and counterpunch became tobacco's strategy.  
</P>
<P>
 "In this area (of lung disease), the statistics are even more confused and of 
more dubious accuracy than they are in the case of cancer or (heart) diseases, 
by reason of problems of diagnosis and nomenclature." (CTR annual report, 
1966-67.) 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . changes in the popularity of such terms as 'emphysema,' may have 
resulted in a fictitious increase in reported prevalence rates." (CTR annual 
report, 1969-70.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to call attention to the exaggeration and lies of the anti-cigarette 
zealots . . . ." (Philip Morris report, 1971.) 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . Any assumption that the results (of painting mice with cigarette tar) 
can be extrapolated directly to other species, especially man, is highly 
presumptuous." (CTR annual report, 1973.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gone over from . . . the 'vigorous denial' approach, the keep quiet 
and take it on the chin attitude, to the strongly voiced opposition and 
criticism . . . . this counter-propaganda is a better stance . . . . We need to 
give the scholarly reply to the improper studies." (Philip Morris internal 
report, 1981.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Attacking bad research . . . attacking researchers themselves, where 
vulnerable." (Philip Morris memo, March 24, 1981.) HARDBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Freddy Homburger, a scientist funded at the time by the research council, 
scheduled a press conference at a scientific convention in Atlantic City in 
April, 1974, to accuse the tobacco industry of attempting to suppress important 
findings about the harmful effects of smoking.  
</P>

 "Got press conference killed without (Homburger) knowing why or how. . . . He 
came into the press room . . . and nicely hastened out the door. . . . I doubt 
if you or Tom will want to retain this note." (A confidential memo from Leonard 
Zahn, a long-time research council publicist, April, 1974.) AND THE BEAT GOES 
ON 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, fifth grade students at Willow Ridge School in Amherst, N.Y., wrote 
R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. about smoking advertisements and health. A company 
publicist replied:  
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Sir or Madam: 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of your fifth grade students have written (about smoking 
advertisements and) . . . about the controversies surrounding cigarette 
smoking. The tobacco industry is also concerned about the charges being made 
that smoking is responsible for so many serious diseases. Long before the 
present criticism began, the tobacco industry in a sincere attempt to determine 
what harmful effects, if any, smoking might have on human health, established 
The Council for Tobacco Research -- U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite all the research going on, the simple and unfortunate fact is that 
scientists do not know the cause or causes of the chronic diseases reported to 
be associated with smoking. . . . We would appreciate your passing this 
information along to your students." Science Bought and Sold 
</P>
<P>
 A hand-scrawled note from the 1960s rated 44 scientists as to "which ones 
might be the greatest benefit to the (tobacco) industry." The note was written 
by an official of the Council of Tobacco Research, which funds scientists with 
tobacco money. The note ended: "Use (the ratings) for what you think they might 
be worth and throw the paper away." 
</P>
<P>
 On of the 44 was Dr. Gary Friedman, now 60, of the Kaiser-Permanente Medical 
Care Program in Oakland. "I needed support for research back then," he 
explains. "They were very interested in how smokers differed from nonsmokers in 
health and mortality." Friedman worked with Carl C. Seltzer, a Harvard 
anthropologist, whom the research council considered a favored scientist who 
has consistently criticized anti-smoking research. Friedman now says that at 
first he "compromised" with Seltzer on their early studies. 
</P>
<P>
 After a further study convinced him that "quitting smoking really seemed to do 
some good," Friedman says, Seltzer and the research council "disassociated 
themselves" from those findings. Friedman published his results in the New 
England Journal of Medicine in February 1979. Seltzer wrote the to Journal: 
"These authors conclude that stopping smoking appears to result in a 
substantial reduction in coronary mortality. I find the procedures used in 
their article to be questionable and the conclusions to be unjustified . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as well," Friedman reflects. "There's a feeling in this building today 
of the wish we had never taken that money." 
</P>
<P>
 Seltzer, now retired, insists that Friedman "wanted to continue getting money 
from the council but didn't want me to have an equal say. His link to smoking 
and mortality was two or three times more than anybody in the country. Sure, 
the council gave me and Harvard a lot of money . . . maybe a million or so. I 
was at it for a great many years. The council liked my research. I also showed 
there was no relationship between heart disease and smoking. And this business 
of secondary smoke, passive smoke, is absolute nonsense . . . nonsense. I don't 
care what the surgeon general says! What does the surgeon general know! He only 
knows what he is told!" 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, Seltzer and others argue that many research council grants have 
little to do with smoking or are sometimes critical of it. But there's little 
disagreement that the research council's influence on anti-smoking scientists 
went beyond money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scientists by their very nature are very cautious," adds Michael Cummings, a 
senior research scientist at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo. 
"That's one of the things the tobacco industry has exploited. They look for 
people to run counter. If the tobacco industry can find a person or two to 
expound the opposite view, it creates controversy, casts doubt on the other 
scientists. They won't say what they believe. It's science by intimidation. 
Controversy means no grants, no funding, no tenure. Money is something 
scientists must have and the tobacco industry and the research council have 
plenty of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The tobacco industry trained anti-smoking researchers to be irresponsibly 
cautious," says Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco. 
"Tobacco industry intimidation causes the health community to apply a standard 
of proof so high on smoking dangers it consistently has understated the risks 
of smoking and has historically delayed actions year after year. The tobacco 
industry jumps up and down and screams controversy! It gives cigarette 
companies their best asset -- credibility. It's a fig leaf for the 
politicians." Blowing Smoke 
</P>
<P>
 After the release of the 1964 surgeon general's report, the Council for 
Tobacco Research bombarded anti- smoking studies with a thesaurus of skeptical 
words, phrases and clauses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fails to support . . . tenuous and inconclusive . . . still quite obscure . . 
. little evidence at present . . . no clear picture has emerged . . . lacked 
adequate controls . . . misdiagnosis . . . still no assurance . . . lend little 
to support . . . did not sustain any claims . . . suggest attention to the 
smoker rather than the smoke . . . speculative . . . baffling . . . superficial 
. . . unanswered . . . masked . . . overdiagnosis . . . fictitious . . . does 
not duplicate real life situations . . . still little is understood . . . many 
anomalous and contradictory aspects . . . no firm evidence . . . problems of 
diagnosis and nomenclature . . . misstated or overstated . . . an impressive 
failure . . . still remain to be explored . . . cannot be concluded . . . 
dubious accuracy . . . confusion of contradictory findings . . . welter of 
fragmentary, confusing and inconclusive observations."

ECLIPSED; MAYBE IT'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF MELROSE AND 
ROBERTSON

 Early this year, when Mortons moved across the street to expanded quarters on 
the former site of Trumps, Bernard Erpicum nabbed the old Mortons spot for his 
new restaurant. The well-connected former Spago maitre d' then signed up Serge 
Falesitch, another Spago (and Chinois) alumnus, to be his partner and executive 
chef; they hired Lambert Monet, the Impressionist's great-grandson, and Henk 
Rijkers as designers. Provencal-California, or St.-Tropez meets West Hollywood. 
The name? Eclipse. Subtitle: cuisine of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Erpicum has opened up the large dining room by moving the bar up front and 
adding a glassed-in kitchen and an outdoor seating area. Despite the curvy pink 
banquettes, swaths of taffeta at the windows and Alexander Mihaylovich's 
startling neoclassical painting of a pharaoh, it still looks awfully familiar. 
Cars turning into the discreet driveway already know the way. Eclipse is 
definitely a dress-up kind of place, with designer labels, acres of decolletage 
and studied tans. Same faces, different decor. The ghost of Mortons Mondays 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Call for a reservation at 8 on a weeknight, and you are told to come at 6:30 
or 9. When you arrive at 9, there isn't an available table inside or out. "The 
wait is much shorter for a table in the garden," the hostess assures us 
repeatedly. No, no, I'll wait for an inside table. I've been whisked into the 
garden on two previous occasions to sit with the unknown-to-Erpicum crowd, and 
lovely as it is on a balmy night, I'd rather, this once, sit inside with the 
A-list.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, I'm curious. My experience in the garden has been less than stellar. The 
waiter frequently forgot all about us, and when we were remembered, not once in 
a three-course meal for five did the right dish go to the right person. We 
soldiered on through a series of disasters: acrid 
grilled-eggplant-and-red-pepper soup; mealy langoustines so overcooked they had 
shriveled in their shells; an oily wild mushroom salad with hardly a fungus, 
wild or domesticated, to be found . . . and that was just for starters. Not 
once did Erpicum stick his nose out the door to check on those of us exiled to 
the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 The specialty at Eclipse is whole fish brushed with olive oil and baked in a 
fruitwood-fired oven, just as at dozens of little places in the south of 
France. Before you order, the waiter shows off a platter of handsome, 
fresh-looking fish. Striped bass, John Dory, scorpion fish, Florida snapper. 
The concept is very appealing, more so when you glimpse the floppy-toqued cooks 
slipping whole fish into the glowing oven. Timing is tricky; with a single 
exception, the fish arrived each time dry and terribly overdone, inexpertly 
filleted. The kitchen has taken pains to procure such beautiful fresh fish, 
it's even more of a shame. But when they do get it right, it is a subtly 
delicious way to eat fish. 
</P>
<P>
 I did have better luck with a couple of specials that managed to suggest what 
the cooks could be capable of, if they ever got on top of the timing in this 
busy kitchen. Dainty fillets of red mullet with basil and the Louisiana prawns 
with a spunky corn salsa are fresh tasting and well executed. Eclipse's menu is 
so straightforward it doesn't demand three-star technique, just competent cooks 
and waiters who pick up the food on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Still waiting at 9:59 for that 9 o'clock table, our fortunes suddenly reverse 
when Erpicum seems to recognize someone in our party. Though he can't quite put 
a name to the face, he's not taking chances. A table inside materializes, one 
of the best in the house. To make up for our hour wait, he offers a dish: 
artichoke risotto, which takes a while to cook.  
</P>
<P>
 While we long for food, we take in the scene: Disney's Michael Eisner, the 
fabulously wealthy Bass brothers, Red Buttons. Assorted blondes. Two 
bodyguards, telltale earphone cords tucked into collars, sussing out the room 
as they get a young sheik and his guests settled at a big table.  
</P>
<P>
 Eclipse is all too egalitarian: You don't get better food just because Erpicum 
thinks he recognizes you. Norwegian salmon in parchment, ordered rare, comes 
out very far from it. Presented in a Chinese bamboo steamer, Chilean sea bass 
has been steamed to within an inch of its life, so overcooked it falls right 
off the fork. Sauteed Dover sole, topped with sage and sliced almonds, a 
beautiful piece of fish, is leathery and ruined. Surf 'n' turf -- overcooked 
lobster and a decent filet mignon -- turns out to be one of the better dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the background of the chef and maitre d', the number of missteps 
is inexplicable. On one visit, our tomatoey Santa Barbara rockfish soup holds 
chunks of rock cod, lots of rubbery squid, a single mussel and none of the 
clams described. Asked about the lack of clams, our waiter shoots us a hostile 
look and heads back to the kitchen. After a good long time, a different waiter 
plunks down a plate of steamed clams. 
</P>
<P>
 Erpicum, who is also a sommelier and stars in his own wine video, has built a 
brightly lighted cellar-shrine in one corner of the dining room. The displayed 
bottles are all a Cabernet produced by one of his limited partners. There he is 
on the label, the noble forehead, the granite chin: Steven Seagal in the guise 
of a Roman bust. To be fair, Erpicum has put together a nice collection of 
wines from Santa Barbara County, the central coast and northern counties, and a 
predictable selection of Burgundies and Bordeaux.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite its premium location, the right crowd and its experienced chef and 
maitre d', Eclipse is still at the dress-rehearsal stage. The entire staff 
needs a lot more practice before this restaurant is ready for prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 Eclipse, 8800 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood; (310) 724- 5959. Dinner only; 
closed Sundays. Smoking permitted in terrace and lounge. Valet parking. Dinner 
for two, food only, $65 - $94. Corkage, $14.

 RANK: Tiny Concordia University in Irvine scores high in the latest collegiate 
rankings from U.S. News & World Report. The school, with 1,500 students, ties 
for fourth among regional liberal arts colleges in the West, up from 19th place 
last year. It tied with LeTourneau University in Longview, Texas. First is 
Evergreen State College in Washington State. . . . Concordia, formerly known as 
Christ College, last year became part of the Concordia University system of 10 
schools operated by the Lutheran Church -- Missouri Synod. 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT? UC Irvine Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening last week outlined an ambitious 
plan to move the campus into the top 30 nationally ranked research 
universities. (B1) But in the magazine's new rankings released Saturday, 
Berkeley at No. 23 is the only UC campus on the top 25 list of national 
universities. . . .UCI once again finishes in the second grouping of schools 
(26th to 57th), along with UCLA and UC campuses at Davis, San Diego and Santa 
Barbara. No. 1 nationally: Harvard is tops among the national universities, and 
Amherst among the national liberal arts colleges.

 BASEBALL BOYCOTT: As Shawn Atteberysees it, he is a baseball fan first and a 
businessman second . . . So when Major League Baseball canceled the rest of the 
season last week, Attebery cleaned out all of the baseball cards and 
collectibles in his Collectors Only shop on East La Palma Avenue in Anaheim. 
"I'm asking customers not to support Major League Baseball until this madness 
stops," says Attebery. "I'm fed up with the whole charade." 
</P>
<P>
 MARKET MADNESS: So, perhaps you've heard about the big supermarket merger in 
the works in which La Habra-based Food 4 Less would merge its Alpha Beta chain 
with Ralphs Grocery Co. . . . Company officials are not saying yet specifically 
which stores will be directly affected, but industry wags are already 
suggesting possible names for new supermarket combination. Topping the list: 
Ralpha Beta and Food 4 Ralph.

STAG'S SPLASHY EXIT LEAVES LAGUNA TALKING; WILDLIFE: DEER CRASHES THROUGH HOME, 
SWIMS TO SEA. LIFEGUARDS TURN IT BACK, BUT IT DIES ANYWAY. 
</P>

 A frantic deer crashed through the kitchen window of an elderly Laguna Beach 
couple's home Saturday morning, then smashed out through a second window before 
dashing into the Pacific Ocean and swimming a mile and a half toward Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhausted, bleeding animal died about two hours later, after lifeguards on 
paddle boards were finally able to turn the 190-pound buck around and swim it 
into shore at Oak Street. Animal control officers, who captured the deer in 
front of 200 onlookers as police held back traffic on Coast Highway, were 
rushing it to a veterinarian when it died. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in extremely bad shape," said Laguna Beach Animal Control officer 
Keith Hall, who was treating the animal when it died. "He must have ruptured 
something and was bleeding from the inside. I don't know how he swam for so 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of sad, because the deer ended up dying after all of the effort to 
save its life," said police Sgt. Doris Weaver. "But, after running through two 
windows, it sustained some pretty serious internal injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said it is not unusual for deer to wander so close to homes in Laguna 
Beach, but noted that they rarely enter the ocean. He estimated that there are 
approximately 100 deer in area canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's bizarre events began shortly before 8:30 a.m., when the buck came 
crashing though a window at the home of Baird and Carol Coffin, who were 
sitting in their dining room eating breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the microwave had exploded," said 82-year-old Baird Coffin. "Then 
all of a sudden, this big buck deer came into our living room. Then we heard 
another crash when he jumped out through our front bay window and ran away." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Coffin, 84, said: "I've never been so scared in my entire life." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors told the couple that they had spotted the deer running frantically 
up and down the street before jumping over the Coffin's back yard fence, where 
it apparently became trapped, Baird Coffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just the strangest thing," he said. "It's the kind of thing that takes 
10 years off of your life, and I don't have that many left." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach lifeguards Scott Diedrich and Jeff Gilbert chased the agitated 
deer on their paddle boards for nearly two hours before they were able redirect 
it toward shore. The deer did not appear to be growing weaker despite its 
injuries and the 3-mile swim. 
</P>
<P>
 "That deer was swimming quite fast," said Diedrich, 28. "He was swimming to 
Catalina. It was definitely mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's unusual rescue was actually the second time Diedrich and Gilbert 
have rescued deer from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, 29, saved a deer last October after it jumped into the water during 
the Laguna Beach wildfire, Diedrich said. In 1991, Diedrich was on duty when a 
deer ran across Pacific Coast Highway at Oak Street and swam out to sea. In 
each incident, the deer survived the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know deer could swim," said Diedrich, who was clearly upset 
Saturday morning when he learned that the deer had died. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so exhausted from his swim and he had all of those cuts," Diedrich 
said. "We were really worried about his condition. We put all of our energy and 
effort into it to ensure that he would survive."

FEUDS TAKE HOMEOWNER GROUPS TO LEGAL LIMITS; PROPERTY: BULGING ASSOCIATION CASE 
FILES IN O.C. COVER EVERYTHING FROM OVERWEIGHT PETS TO SATELLITE DISHES.

 John Drews' life has never been quite the same since he took the Harbor Ridge 
Assn. to court eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A Newport Beach heart surgeon, Drews sued the homeowner association when it 
refused to allow him to trim the trees that had grown to obstruct his home's 
panoramic view of Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 As the resulting legal battle heated up, Drews took leave from his medical 
practice to give the case his complete attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our case went longer than the Iran-Contra trial of (President Ronald 
Reagan's National Security Adviser) John Poindexter," he said. "And it was all 
over a bunch of trees. It was so ludicrous. I just wanted to get away from 
those people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, after running up legal bills that topped $150,000, Drews prevailed 
in a two-week jury trial. As soon as the trees were trimmed, he sold the 
$950,000 house. 
</P>
<P>
 But the experience left such scars -- "I felt so wronged" -- that the 
52-year-old heart surgeon decided to chuck a lucrative medical career to enroll 
in law school. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of homeowners' associations in Orange County and Southern 
California is full of stories just like Drews'. 
</P>
<P>
 They involve neighborhood feuds over association rules prohibiting such things 
as pets that weigh too much, privacy fences that are too private, garage doors 
that remain open too long, back yard satellite dishes, home paint colors deemed 
nonconforming and more. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most unusual drove a woman from her Santa Ana condo a couple years 
ago, when the Townsquare Owners Assn. cited the 51-year-old grandmother for 
kissing her date good night in the driveway of her complex. Her transgression: 
"doing bad things for an hour" in a parked car. 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeowner associations were originally created to provide services 
traditionally delivered by cities and counties. Over the past two decades, 
these "residential governments" have multiplied dramatically and now number an 
estimated 150,000 nationally, and 20,000 in California covering communities 
where some 5 million people live. 
</P>
<P>
 (Only Florida has more associations than California.) 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of homeowners, the attraction can be one of simple economics. 
Residents pay monthly fees to maintain attractive neighborhood landscaping or 
for access to common recreational amenities such as golf courses, parks, 
clubhouses, lakes, tennis courts and swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 But this growth has not come without problems. Courthouses are full of 
association disputes, some of which have grown from the tiny neighborhood 
battle to the legal cause celebre.  
</P>
<P>
 Only two weeks ago, the California Supreme Court added more clout to homeowner 
groups throughout the state when it ruled that associations could ban cats and 
other pets from homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just unbelievable," said attorney Joel Tamray, who represented the woman 
seeking to keep her three felines, Boo-Boo, Dockers and Tulip. "Anybody buying 
a condo these days really should take a hard look. I think this decision alone 
could depreciate condominiums by at least 10%." 
</P>
<P>
 In the higher reaches of homeowner association bureaucracy, however, Debra 
Bass, a spokeswoman for the Community Association Institute in Arlington, Va., 
said the decision in "the cat case" and others like it are working to maintain 
the "sense of order" people expect when they buy into communities governed by 
their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homes are the largest investments in people's lives," said Bass. 
"Associations provide people stable and predictable environments. They also 
give residents access to neighborhood things like swimming pools and tennis 
courts -- amenities that were once the exclusive domain of the wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
 At their best, Bass said, homeowner groups serve the common interests of the 
residents. In the up-and-down world of the real estate marketplace, for 
example, rules governing neighborhood neatness and uniformity can help keep 
property values somewhat stable, even though some residents might gripe about 
having to cut their grass or weed their gardens according to association 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 A united homeowner association can also prove to be a worthy opponent for 
powerful developers or home builders in disputes over home construction defects 
and shoddy workmanship. Bass said there "numerous examples of associations 
which have won multimillion-dollar judgments against big developers because of 
problems they have caused in the neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, people like state Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata) have seen 
associations at their worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people have no idea what they are getting into," said Hauser, chairman 
of the Assembly's Committee on Housing and Community Development. "They thought 
they were buying a house -- their castle -- and then find out they can't paint 
the house blue; they gotta pull weeds when somebody tells them; and they can't 
put a gazebo or hot tub in the back yard because it's really not your back 
yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of Marty Goodman: 
</P>
<P>
 When Goodman purchased her Fullerton condo 17 years ago, she also bought into 
a belief that the local homeowner's association would maintain the attractive 
landscaping and the "delightful" water fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, the 76-year-old widow has dutifully paid her monthly maintenance 
fees -- now hovering near $200 per month -- even though the fountain was turned 
off years ago and the grounds have long lost their luster. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in a trembling voice, Goodman said her Amberwood-Fullerton 
Homeowners Assn. went too far when they asked her to dig up the rose bushes she 
and a friend planted to provide some color to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In its letter dated Aug. 25, the association stated: "It's been brought to the 
attention of the Board of Directors that you have been planting roses outside 
of your patio area. This is in violation of the Common Area Rules and 
Regulations of your association. . . . We are hoping that you will have this 
issue resolved immediately upon receipt of this letter." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Goodman: "I put those roses in the ground five years ago. Me and my 
neighbor have tended to them. Now they want me to dig them up? I'm not gonna do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that Goodman will be able to keep her roses after all. Amberwood 
President Mary Lee Todd said the letter was the work of one board member who 
might have had "a personal thing" against Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd said the association has more serious problems to tend to than Goodman's 
roses, even though they are "growing a little wild." Todd said homeowners are 
still trying to recover from the loss of nearly $1 million embezzled by a 
former association manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems often come down to cases in which association directors simply 
take their authority too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, in my opinion, you have people in charge of these associations who 
always wanted to be the fire chief, or the police chief," Hauser said. "Because 
nobody wants to take on the responsibility of managing these things, you have 
these people with all the power, and, by God, they are going to enforce the 
rules." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, some relief for residents has come in the form of state 
legislation which requires homeowner associations, like all other forms of 
government, to hold their meetings in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, we found that the workings of the associations were a very 
closed process," Hauser said. "We wanted to make sure everybody was provided a 
chance to know what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, new legislation, which took effect in January, now requires all 
warring parties in association disputes to first seek some form of mediation 
before bringing their fights to court. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the boom in association living -- it is estimated that one in eight 
Americans lives in a community governed by an association -- comes a 
corresponding increase in problems that require some form of attorney-assisted 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of disputes are probably the fastest growing areas of law," said 
Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is no surprise that some attorneys have tailored their entire practices 
to deal with the legal vagaries of association living. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, for example, the law firm of Fiore, Nordberg, Walker & Racobs has 
represented about 2,000 associations in Orange, Riverside, Los Angeles and San 
Diego counties. Earlier this month, the firm sponsored its eighth annual 
seminar for those interested in community association law and management, and 
about 270 people showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Southern California, San Diego attorney Sandra Brower is known as 
one of the best advocates in business for the owners of satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 In about a dozen decisions against homeowner associations, Brower said, she's 
never lost a dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Her most-publicized victory -- which remains the only case of its kind ever to 
be reviewed by a California appeals court -- came in a case involving the 
Trabuco Canyon community of Portola Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident John James said he knew about the association's ban on satellite 
dishes, but put it up in his back yard anyway, because he thought the 
association's board of directors would be "reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the added entertainment channels it provides, James said the dish 
was also important for capturing weather forecasts from around the world for 
use in his work as a pilot for a local family. 
</P>
<P>
 James said he attempted to negotiate and pay for a variance in the association 
rules to allow for the dish, but was turned down. Within two weeks after the 
dish was installed in 1987, he got a letter from his association's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a couple egomaniacs on that board who felt very strongly that they 
would prevail," James said. "They went and got themselves an attorney. My 
attorney (Brower) just buried him." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, James said, the $40,000 he spent to keep his $1,000-dish was well 
worth the effort. As part of the court's decision, the court ordered the 
association to pay James' attorneys fees plus $3,000 in sanctions for bringing 
a frivolous lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the strangest thing, but another guy in the neighborhood put up a 
satellite dish and the board is now going after him, too," James said. "I guess 
it's true when they say a fool repeats his folly." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second case, the president of Portola Hills Homeowner Assn. No. 1, 
Margurett Nicholson, agrees with James. She said the association has "learned 
nothing" from its experience with James. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not in favor of this lawsuit, but we have an attorney on the board who 
kind of controls things," Nicholson said. "I'm totally frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach attorney Stanley Feldsott is a veteran of these wars, having 
represented about 300 associations in California and some homeowners, including 
Drews the heart surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most obscure legal files involving associations have, at some time 
or another, found their way to his briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 One involved a Palos Verdes man who withheld $500 in association fees because 
he alleged the association used an insecticide inside his unit that killed his 
two pet goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Representing the Palos Verdes Bay Club Assn., Feldsott won the case for his 
clients and the resident was forced to pay legal fees totaling $20,000 per 
goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
 In Marina del Rey, the attorney has taken on the case of a woman who is 
fighting her association's rules against the type of bamboo shade she placed on 
her condominium balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 The shade in question is a three-piece model. The association prefers a 
one-piece shade. The fight continues, but the legal bills have passed the 
$100,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, nothing seems to tickle him more mention of the 1992 case involving a 
couple of overweight dogs named Katie and Kahlua in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Feldsott was representing the Jasmine Park Homeowners Assn., 
which had a ban on dogs exceeding the association's 35-pound weight limit, and 
sued homeowners whose canines tipped the neighborhood scales. 
</P>
<P>
 While one resident placed her pup on a low-fat, high-fiber diet to make 
weight, Gary Roberts, the owner of a 48-pound Labrador retriever, and Tania 
Allard, who had a 100-pound, partially-blind and arthritic Airedale, decided to 
challenge the regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I thought it was a joke," Roberts said. "I laughed. (The 
association) sent me a letter requesting a certificate of weight from a 
licensed veterinarian. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Jasmine homeowners had twice before rejected attempts to change 
the association rule, Feldsott said they eventually gave in and the lawsuit was 
dismissed. "I'm sure those dogs are just stuffing themselves now," he said 
jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 But out-of-court settlements are not always in the cards when it comes to 
homeowner disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Assemblyman Hauser, Feldsott said association residents generally are not 
interested in the association's workings and are unaware of the rules until 
they become involved in disputes themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In their encounters with association management, some residents are likely to 
encounter long-serving directors who are only working in those positions 
because nobody else cared to take on the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are designed as little democracies, but they start to take on the 
appearance of malevolent dictatorships after a while," Feldsott said. "It 
becomes a dictatorship because no one wants to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Bass of the Community Association Institute in Virginia acknowledges that 
there have been problems, but they are the "ones that tend to make the 
headlines." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the institute's mission, she said, is to educate association directors 
and homeowners about how to strike a friendly coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love thy neighbor," states one of the institute's 116 "tips to ensure a happy 
community association experience." Other commandments include: "Curb thy dog, 
don't play the stereo too loud, park in your own space and don't be a six-car 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first few "tips" for association board members: "Serve because you 
care, not because you have a hidden agenda." And "don't go on a power trip."

 If the collapse of the Antelope Valley Freeway and fatal cave-in of the 
Northridge Meadows Apartments were among the most vivid images of the January 
earthquake, the clusters of quake-damaged "ghost towns" are destined to become 
its most stubborn legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once working-class neighborhoods buzzing with activity, these pockets of 
destruction and misery sit mostly vacant, with only about half of the crumbling 
buildings undergoing repairs while the others have become trash-strewn lairs 
for scavengers, vandals and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Visions of a festering urban nightmare prompted Los Angeles officials to seal 
off many of the 507 ghost town properties and launch a multi-pronged attack 
backed by a massive infusion of government loans. But despite such aid, 
neglected properties continue to decay -- in some cases suffering more damage 
than from the quake -- increasing repair costs and putting entire neighborhoods 
at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Looters have moved like locusts through the cracked and leaning rooms of Bud 
Goldshine's 35-unit apartment building in Granada Hills, taking everything of 
value, including the rooftop solar panels. His original repair estimate doubled 
to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And then came the final insult: Scavengers put their own lock on the gated 
complex's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to stay away from the building as much as I can," said Goldshine, whose 
property is in foreclosure. "It's just too hard for me to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 As grim as Goldshine's experience has been, he is far from alone. There are 
clear signs that many of the ghost towns' 11,000 damaged dwelling units -- 
particularly those in debt-laden buildings in poorer areas -- will haunt the 
city's recovery effort for years: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seven months after the quake, no repairs had begun in more than half of the 
severely damaged ghost town properties, according to a Times survey of 
buildings and building permit records. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly a quarter of the owners of the most devastated ghost town properties 
say they do not plan to rebuild and many say they will allow their buildings to 
fall into foreclosure, according to interviews with more than 40 landlords 
representing 63 ghost town properties. Another 20% of those landlords say they 
are still uncertain whether they will rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 * As recently as last month, city housing officials identified three new ghost 
towns -- increasing the total to 15, mostly near the quake's epicenter in the 
San Fernando Valley but also in Hollywood and the Mid-City areas. Total ghost 
town damage has been estimated at $140 million, and that figure is expected to 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Los Angeles had never before experienced a calamity of this 
magnitude, urban planners and development experts say lessons from natural 
disasters elsewhere signal that a long, drawn-out struggle lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the 1989 Loma Prieta quake destroyed about 9,000 apartments, 
hotel rooms and condominiums, primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area's 
working-class neighborhoods. Four years later, only half of the multifamily 
units had been replaced, partly because of funding delays and gaps in 
government recovery programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse was the experience at Naranja Lake, a South Florida neighborhood of 
4,000 before Hurricane Andrew hit in 1992. Not long after the winds died down, 
squatters, prostitutes and drug dealers took over those homes that were not 
flattened. 
</P>
<P>
 While property owners fought a two-year legal battle with contractors, 
insurance companies and each other, hundreds of homes deteriorated. As of this 
month, everything had been bulldozed except for one high-rise building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a miserable, miserable situation," said Tom David, director of We Will 
Rebuild, the private foundation established to rebuild South Florida after the 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the 15 pockets of damage left in the wake of the Northridge 
quake share many similarities, beyond merely meeting the official definition of 
a ghost town: A cluster of apartments and condos with 100 or more dwelling 
units that have incurred at least $5,000 in damage per unit. 
</P>
<P>
 In almost all ghost towns, chain-link fences encircle split and boarded 
buildings, their yards overgrown with weeds and littered by trash, discarded 
furniture and chunks of fractured concrete. Graffiti are scrawled on the 
outside of many buildings -- some of it gang tags, some unheeded warnings not 
to trespass. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the buildings are similar, many simple stucco structures built in the 
1960s when building codes were more lenient. (In fact, some experts believe 
that the relaxed construction standards shared by many ghost town buildings led 
to their demise.) 
</P>
<P>
 But the pace of repairs is inconsistent; landlords with property in more 
affluent areas move more quickly than those who own buildings in poorer areas. 
On a recent weekday morning, the din of power saws and cement mixers roared 
through a Sherman Oaks ghost town. But across the Valley, in an abandoned North 
Hills apartment, prostitutes and other transients slept peacefully, no 
construction work within earshot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, in stronger-market areas the revival is moving along more rapidly," 
said Robert T. Moncrief, major projects director for the city's Housing 
Department. "You will have properties in weaker areas where owners will walk 
away and banks will end up foreclosing." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Sarin Sam, the owner of a 14-unit complex in a gritty North Hills 
neighborhood, said he didn't bother to seek government help to rebuild and 
allowed his property to fall into foreclosure because "even without the 
earthquake, this place was going to go down anyways." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials, learning from the successes and failures of other 
disaster-stricken cities, quickly made the ghost towns a top priority in their 
rebuilding effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's objective is a quick recovery. The longer repairs are delayed, the 
longer buildings sit vulnerable to the destructive reign of the elements -- 
natural and criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the city assembled a task force that has worked to broker deals 
between lenders and landlords to help financially troubled owners get a break 
on mortgage payments so they can rebuild. If a bank is willing, the city will 
provide zero- or low-interest repair loans from a $310-million pool of federal 
disaster aid and local housing funds. So far, the city has agreed to loan $30 
million  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Small Business Administration announced in June that it would 
give top priority to loan requests from ghost town property owners. By 
mid-September, the SBA had approved 133 loans totaling $45 million to ghost 
town property owners, rejecting another 68 requests -- an approval rating 
higher than that for the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban planners agree that such rebuilding efforts are the only reasonable 
strategy, even in a city with a stagnating population and a depressed housing 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are the alternatives?" asked William Fulton, publisher of the California 
Planning and Development Report. "You can allow the ghost towns to remain ghost 
towns, or the other alternative is to bulldoze everything and start all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Soja, chairman of UCLA's urban planning program, warns that the biggest 
mistake governments have made after other disasters was offering a "one size 
fits all" recovery program that fails to address those financially troubled 
properties in poor neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The absence of special programs for the most seriously affected people, those 
unable to respond, is the primary tragedy," Soja said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, 6% of the most severely damaged properties are already in default 
because their owners have failed to make mortgage payments for at least four 
months, according to property records. Defaulting is the first step toward 
foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 For those hard-luck cases, city officials have begun to offer another plan: 
pairing struggling landlords with nonprofit organizations interested in 
providing low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 When that approach doesn't work, officials say, they plan to begin the process 
of razing those buildings where no repairs have begun by January. "I think you 
are going to see this city reaching decisions about demolition faster" than 
normal, said Barbara Zeidman, assistant general manager of the city's Housing 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Such drastic measures are necessary, they say, to stop the ripple effect that 
began within days of the quake as entire neighborhoods shut down, cutting off 
foot traffic to nearby business districts and threatening to turn them into 
commercial ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Northridge mini-mall, the quake has already closed a dry cleaner and 
video store. The only clients keeping Jaleh Rimando's NY Subs sandwich shop 
open are the hungry construction workers rebuilding the nearby ghost town 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they weren't here I'd have to close the business," Rimando said. The ghost 
towns' neighbors have their own problems. Not only do their stable, undamaged 
neighborhoods face almost certain declines in property values, but in some 
cases they are already fighting roaches and rats migrating from the vacant 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor of the most famous ghost town building -- the collapsed Northridge 
Meadows Apartments where 16 people were killed -- said he has watched a 
burgeoning population of rats grow strong dining off his two orange trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time, I hit one with a flat-head shovel but it just kind of got stunned," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the name ghost town gives the impression of inactivity, the enclaves 
are actually alive with activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Skateboarding teen-agers have descended on the drained swimming pools of a 
Granada Hills ghost town. Prostitutes are turning tricks in vacant Sylmar 
buildings. Gang members chug beer in abandoned North Hills apartments. And the 
ghost town in the West Adams area has become the haunt of crack smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said reported crime is down about 20% in those neighborhoods, but they 
concede that numbers don't tell the whole story because fewer residents remain 
to make reports. They believe unreported crime is up, particularly trespassing, 
vandalism, theft and prostitution. Trespassers are also suspected of starting 
fires in ghost town buildings, causing millions of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the city's fencing and boarding of ghost towns has not kept out the 
homeless and what one apartment owner described as the "sophisticated" looters, 
one of whom was arrested carrying a shopping list for his haul. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wait for the security guards to walk by, then we sneak in," a 
17-year-old youth said as he and two friends sat in a dark North Hills 
apartment recently. "(Some people) use the place to store drugs or guns, but we 
just drink here." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners are stuck with the frustration, and the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "About six different times I have put chains and locks on the front door of 
the fence and people have cut them," Cesar Olmos said of his 14-unit Hollywood 
apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hills neighborhood near Orion Avenue and Parthenia Street -- with 
its history of pre-quake crime and poverty -- probably has the worst crime 
problem of all the ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the quake, the two square miles patrolled by Los Angeles Police Officer 
Henry Acosta routinely accounted for 20% of the crime in the Devonshire 
Division's 52-square-mile jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Acosta said, the crime has moved into the area's 11 vacant buildings, 
where it is harder to see and stop. Prostitutes, who once did business 
primarily in and around the low-rent motels on Sepulveda Boulevard, have set up 
shop in the vacant units, taking advantage of the free rent. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent search through a 40-unit complex, Acosta stepped over shards of 
glass, spent condoms and the instruments of crack cocaine use: disposable 
lighters and glass pipes. The stench of decaying food and clogged toilets 
filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicking in a barricaded door, Acosta found a startled, shirtless man. The man 
said he was homeless but Acosta showed no sympathy, telling him: "This is 
someone's house. You don't belong here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the front of the complex was sealed off by an eight-foot chain-link 
fence topped by razor wire, Acosta pointed out a fallen brick wall at the back 
of the property. Neighbors said they see a parade of people enter the building 
nightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have got to do something, especially with all the abandoned buildings, or 
they are all going to go one by one," said Eddie Gonzalez, a Neighborhood Watch 
captain on Orion Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to such complaints, the city's Housing Department increased the 
number of guards from two to 10 at the North Hills ghost town and have armed 
some guards. A team of mounted police were also assigned to daylight patrols in 
the area this month, even though residents say things get worse at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Such crime has flourished partly because the owners of many apartment 
buildings -- the main housing stock of the ghost towns -- have for years been 
teetering on the edge of financial ruin, leaving them unable to afford repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Jan. 17 quake, Valley apartment owners suffered heavy losses from a 
nearly double-digit vacancy rate, declining rents and drop in apartment 
building sales prices of about 1% per month since mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the quake, I had never seen so much financial suffering. And now it's 
worse," said Dan Faller, president of the 12,000-member Apartment Owners Assn. 
of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the most severely damaged ghost town properties cited myriad other 
obstacles blocking their recovery, including inflexible mortgage lenders, 
reluctant insurance companies, a sluggish government loan process and fears of 
mounting debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Also weighing heavily on many landlords' minds is uncertainty about whether 
they will be among the few or the many in their neighborhoods to rebuild. No 
one wants to go into debt to make repairs only to find that the rest of the 
neighborhood still looks like a war zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small guys like myself need some reassurance," said Dennis Carter, who owns 
an 11-unit apartment complex in Sherman Oaks that partially collapsed in the 
quake. "I'm afraid the rest of the neighborhood won't come back." 
</P>
<P>
 For condo owners, rebuilding can be particularly complicated and frustrating. 
In addition to applying for loans and battling with insurers, they must reach 
group decisions on whether to rebuild. In many cases, emotions run high and 
nerves are frayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is really burned out just getting this far," said Wayne Lipschitz, 
who recently resigned as president of the Carlyle Towers condominium 
association in Sherman Oaks, saying the job consumed his life. Unless something 
miraculous happens quickly, he said, he will probably walk away from his 
$45,000 in equity. He predicts many in his building will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although development experts forecast that Los Angeles' housing market will 
rebound in four or five years, they say many property owners will not be able 
to wait out the bad times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contemporary conditions are such that it will make any kind of quick and 
complete recovery very, very difficult," said Soja, the UCLA urban planner. 
</P>
<P>
 As city officials, landlords and police wrestle with the financing and crime 
problems and press for additional security and quick repairs, a lingering 
question stalks the recovery effort: Will images of crumbling buildings and 
wholesale looting slow tenants from returning to the ghost towns once they are 
rebuilt? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a question Victor Garcia answered for himself just hours after the quake: 
He is never coming back to the Reseda condo where he lived for four years until 
it collapsed into the first-story carport. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad memories, the 45-year-old machinist said, have made it nearly impossible 
even to visit his old neighborhood, where the building is being razed. 
"Sometimes we'll drive by, and it's dark, it's ugly. I try to think that it is 
just a memory, but to be here is reliving it." 
</P>
<P>
 Housing officials and development experts say there is no way to predict how 
many residents will share Garcia's feelings and stay away because there is no 
precedent for a disaster as large as the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't know if (reconstructed buildings) will be filled until they 
are built," said Jay Natelson, president of an Encino-based 
financial-consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Already some apartment owners say they plan to offer lower rents and other 
incentives, such as one month's free rent. Others expect the repairs to give 
their aging buildings a new glow and better marketability because newer seismic 
standards ensure that they will be stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Fragoso Jr., whose parents own two properties in Hollywood, said he 
expects to cut rents when he reopens in February. But even that, he concedes, 
may not be enough to bring the buildings back from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have a really tough time filling the complex," Fragoso said. 
"It was hard hit and I think people will remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Timothy Williams contributed to this story. Ghost Towns / 
Quake-Damaged Buildings Stand Vacant, Vandalized 
</P>
<P>
 The devastation of the Northridge quake left pockets of vacant, damaged 
buildings throughout the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere, creating "ghost 
town" neighborhoods where drug dealers, squatters and prostitutes now operate 
away from the eyes of police and neighbors. A multi-pronged government plan has 
been launched to quickly repair the buildings and ensure that the structures do 
not deteriorate further. But already there is evidence that it will be a long 
time before many of the crumbling buildings are repaired. 
</P>

 This ghost town is in the heart of Hollywood's entertainment area.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CHAOS LIKELY WITHOUT PEACEFUL TRANSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When former President Jimmy Carter, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and retired Gen. 
Colin L. Powell met with Haiti's Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras on Saturday, the first 
item on their agenda was persuading the enigmatic general to give up and go 
into exile -- but that wasn't the only thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, setting a departure time and destination for Cedras and other members 
of Haiti's military regime might prove to be the easiest part of Carter's 
mission, Administration officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more difficult -- and, in the long run, more important -- is making 
sure that the Haitian rulers leave in such a way as to produce a peaceful 
transition of government, rather than a chaotic free-for-all that might still 
require U.S. forces to fight their way in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way in which they would depart is not a simple thing," a senior official 
said. "There are a lot of issues involved." 
</P>
<P>
 High on the list, the Administration hopes Carter can persuade Cedras to order 
his troops not to resist U.S. forces when they land, thereby reducing the 
chance that other officers will launch guerrilla-style resistance to a U.S. 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 For the same reason, U.S. officials say they are willing to let any of Haiti's 
corrupt and brutal officers corps flee into exile if they choose -- not merely 
the top triumvirate of Cedras, Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby and Lt. Col. 
Michel-Joseph Francois. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those officers are presumably guilty of ordering killings and other 
atrocities against Haiti's population, but Administration officials have 
tacitly accepted that letting them flee may be the necessary price of a 
peaceful outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Haitian side of the table, Cedras wants a promise of amnesty for anyone 
who served his regime loyally. Until now, at least, exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide has offered only a limited amnesty, promising not to 
prosecute officers merely for their service or for supporting the military 
regime but maintaining the right to pursue them for common crimes against the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince thus revolve around 
a question even more important than whether Cedras and his colleagues leave: 
What happens in Haiti during the days and weeks to come? 
</P>
<P>
 Will its armed forces take the nation into a ruinous little war with the 
United States, or strike out against civilians in a final spasm of rage? Or 
will they cooperate with the change that the United States and the United 
Nations are demanding, including the return to power of the officers' nemesis, 
Aristide? 
</P>
<P>
 And at the bottom line: If U.S. forces land in Haiti as planned, will they 
face what the Pentagon planners call a hostile environment or a permissive one? 
</P>
<P>
 Merely removing the top layer of the Haitian military doesn't resolve the 
situation -- and could even create new difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "That, in effect, would (be) the removal of whatever form of authority 
currently exists in Haiti, and it could likely be a very dangerous situation, 
so it doesn't resolve the problem," State Department spokesman Mike McCurry 
noted last week. 
</P>
<P>
 It was significant, officials said, that Cedras arranged for Carter, Nunn and 
Powell to meet with his entire nine-member high command. That suggested that 
Cedras wanted to assure his commanders that he would not make a deal behind 
their backs -- and that he would hold out for something that would address 
their fears about survival after Aristide returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The exiled president has promised that he will seek "reconciliation" with 
those who supported the military regime, but the officers have no confidence in 
those statements and want strong U.S. guarantees that they, their aides and 
families will be safe. "They don't believe Aristide, and they never will," one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Cedras himself has told visitors that he will insist on 
"dignity" in any negotiated solution. 
</P>
<P>
 That apparently means more than just military ceremony. Cedras has spoken 
increasingly of running for president in Haiti's next election at the end of 
1995 and has asked for a promise that he can return to the country to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Those conditions could put Clinton in the uncomfortable position of suddenly 
building up the political legitimacy of a man he denounced again on Saturday as 
a "brutal dictator." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials have said that they want to move Cedras and his colleagues 
"as far away as possible" from Haiti to prevent them from interfering with the 
restoration of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, a senior official said, the Administration is "willing to talk 
about" Cedras' political ambitions as long as the general is willing to step 
down from power and allow Aristide to return now. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials acknowledge that there is one large factor in these 
negotiations that they do not fully understand: the psychology of Cedras and 
his cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras has reportedly swung back and forth during the past weeks and days, 
sometimes suggesting he is ready to step down, then reversing course and 
insisting he will fight to the death. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras' wife, Yannick Prosper, the daughter of one of Haiti's wealthiest men, 
"has been a bad influence on him," bolstering his hard-line tendencies, one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois, the Port-au-Prince police commander, has reportedly urged a 
compromise, even though his forces have been charged with many of the most 
brutal atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said his wife and children have already fled the country and 
are sitting out the crisis in the neighboring Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 But Biamby, the army chief of staff, has been playing a hard-line role, at 
least publicly. "Rumors of any compromise are totally false," he declared 
Saturday.

GOP HAS PULPIT AT MEETING OF RELIGIOUS RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual strategy conference of the Christian Coalition met this weekend in 
the shadow of a large question mark that has long hovered over the political 
efforts of religious conservatives: 
</P>
<P>
 Can they channel the moral passions that infuse their grass-roots adherents 
into mainstream politics without turning off more voters than they convert? 
</P>
<P>
 Beholding the 3,000 delegates to the gathering, which concluded Saturday, Pat 
Robertson, founder of the group, hailed them as representatives of "one of the 
most powerful political forces that has ever been in the history of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting Robertson's bullish appraisal was the flock of prominent 
Republicans who addressed the conference. All sought support for GOP candidates 
this fall, in some cases with an eye toward advancing their own presidential 
ambitions in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, as even People for the American Way, a liberal group that has set 
itself up as a watchdog of the political efforts of religious conservatives, 
conceded last week in a poll on social attitudes, most Americans "embrace 
traditional moral and religious values." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the sticking point for the religious right in politics, as the 
poll results suggest and some analysts believe, is that many of the specific 
policies it backs foster controversy -- chief among them, opposition to 
abortion. Moreover, the militant rhetoric of its partisans also stirs alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 The net result, past experience shows, is that often the candidates of the 
religious right do well in organizational battles but falter before a broader 
electorate. Thus, last week in Minnesota, Republican gubernatorial candidate 
Allen Quist, who, backed by conservative Christians, had won the endorsement of 
the state GOP convention, lost the primary election to incumbent Republican 
Gov. Arne Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid antagonizing potential supporters, a number of the speakers here 
sought to depict their goals as broadly and blandly as possible. All Christian 
conservatives want, Robertson contended, is "a return to the kind of government 
America had during the Eisenhower Administration in the 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
 "For that we are called the 'radical right,' " he said. "I don't think that's 
radical at all. I think that's just common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson also sought to stress the ecumenical appeal of his 1.4-million 
member group. He contended that it speaks not only for 40 million or 50 million 
Protestant evangelicals but also "30 or 40 million pro-family Roman Catholics." 
</P>
<P>
 Notorious Watergate-era figure G. Gordon Liddy, now a radio talk show host, 
advised conference-goers Saturday that Jews agree with their positions on many 
issues. "Do not exclude them from your thoughts as natural allies," he said. 
"Don't frighten them by going around saying, 'This is a Christian country.' 
Remember you need all the allies you can get because your enemies are many and 
we are few." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every speaker here echoed the lament of American Red Cross President 
Elizabeth Hanford Dole appearing as a surrogate for her husband, Senate 
Republican leader and 1996 presidential prospect Bob Dole, that "we have come 
dangerously close to eroding the moral underpinnings of our society." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one speaker, former drug czar William J. Bennett, sought to put 
the religious conservative concern about one issue, gay rights, in a broader 
perspective, suggesting that it might make more sense to focus on the breakdown 
of marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look in terms of damage to the children of America you cannot compare 
the homosexual movement, the gay rights movement, in terms of damage to what 
divorce has done," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, a number of speakers criticized President Clinton, a frequent 
target, for his efforts to lift the ban on gays serving in the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the issue of abortion rights, Phyllis Schlafly, a longtime foe of the 
feminist movement, made clear that she was not prepared to back down from the 
party's stand against abortion, a position embodied in its last four 
presidential platforms. Referring to efforts by moderate Republicans to abandon 
that stance, she said: "You and I must not let that happen." 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year and the year after I'll see you at all those Republican Party 
primaries and caucuses where you and I, working together, will prove that a 
majority of the Republican Party is pro-life." 
</P>
<P>
 In another apparent attempt to soften the sharp edges of the conservative 
Christian movement, Bennett suggested that moral objectives cannot always be 
reached through political means. After depicting the various problems besetting 
American society from the "coarsening of the culture" to the high crime rate, 
he said: "The solution to these problems, I have become increasingly convinced, 
lies beyond politics. It lies in a fundamental change of the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 "Stay involved in politics," Bennett advised the audience, which cheered him 
lustily through most of his talk. "But do it as your civic duty, not as your 
hope for perfection. Your hope for perfection is in God's love." 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the rhetoric here had to do with the changes that could be wrought 
through the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a conservative tidal wave about to hit the shores of America and 
that means victory in '94 and goodby Clinton in '96," former Vice President Dan 
Quayle, another 1996 presidential prospect, declared to a thunderous ovation. 
"People who were never active before are coming forward and saying, 'Enough is 
enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here in the nation's capital to send a message," declared Ralph Reed, 
executive director of the coalition. "And that message is that we are fed up 
with Clinton-style liberalism and in six weeks that comes to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve that objective, Reed said the organization plans to spend $1 
million to $3 million through its local chapters to register voters, inform 
them on issues and get them to the polls on Election Day, Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition already has distributed 10 million voting guides spelling out 
where candidates stand on such issues as the balanced budget amendment, 
abortion rights, gun control and gay rights. And just before Labor Day, the 
Christian Coalition sent a letter to 250,000 churches around the country asking 
for their cooperation in its registration drive. 
</P>
<P>
 It also plans to distribute another 30 million voter guides in 300 different 
versions for state and local elections. "When you get a voter guide in the 
hands of voters," D.J. Gribbin, director of field operations, coached the 
conference attendees, "that makes a truly great difference."

ADVISERS' ROLE IN BICYCLE CLUB OFFER RAISES QUESTIONS; GAMBLING: TRUSTEE SAYS 
HE HAD NO PART IN PICKING WINNER. ATTORNEY WITHDRAWS GAMING APPLICATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men who have overseen the Bicycle Club Casino for the federal government 
and handled purchase offers were listed as part of a group recently chosen to 
buy the U.S. stake in the club for nearly $38 million, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal trustee and his attorney, who together are paid more than $300,000 a 
year to help run the vast Bell Gardens casino for the government, were named on 
gaming registration applications filed with the California attorney general's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica investment group, which includes business agents for 
Hollywood celebrities, identified the federal trustee, Harry J. Richard, as its 
proposed casino manager and his counsel, Las Vegas attorney James F. Lisowski 
Sr., as both an owner and manager. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, prospective buyers of the club were instructed to contact Richard 
for information on acquiring the government's controlling interest in the 
casino, which was seized four years ago in a drug money laundering case. 
Richard and Lisowski presented the final purchase offers to federal officials 
at a meeting last month in their Las Vegas offices. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Richard said he had no role in the selection of a buyer. He 
confirmed that he had discussions not only with the winning bidder but with 
most bidders about remaining general manager of the casino, but had not struck 
any agreements to take the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every group has offered me some sort of position to stay with them in one 
form or another," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisowski acknowledged that he filled out a state gaming registration 
application but denied that he was one of the investors in Club Acquisition 
Partners, which was selected late last month to purchase the government's 36% 
interest in California's second-largest card casino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no role," he said. "I am not a partner." 
</P>
<P>
 His application form shows that his percentage of ownership and dollar amount 
invested have yet "to be determined." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no money in it," he said. "No, I am not a buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 After inquiries from The Times, Lisowski sent state gaming officials a letter 
last week withdrawing his application. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter had not been received by state officials in Sacramento as of late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials said they are examining the $38-million transaction to 
determine whether the roles of the trustee and his attorney could constitute a 
conflict, since they may have acted both as agents for the government and as 
potential business associates of the winning bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of their responsibility was . . . to give us their business judgment 
about the offers," a federal source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities said they conducted background checks on the investment 
group, but were unaware that Lisowski had applied for a California gaming 
license and that Richard was listed as proposed manager by the partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you are telling me is something absolutely, 100% news to me," said Tim 
Miller, a supervising deputy for the U.S. Marshals Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard said he did not try to influence the outcome of the bidding. "I tried 
to do everything the proper way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Bar officials in Nevada, where Lisowski practices law, declined as a 
matter of policy to comment on the matter. Bar rules prohibit attorneys from 
representing both sides in a transaction, or acquiring an ownership interest 
adverse to their client, without fully disclosing their role. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisowski defended his role, saying that he had no input into the sale or the 
terms of the deal and that he does not have a financial interest in the 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 The casino sale will not be final until legal hurdles are cleared, including 
the approval of a federal judge and the licensing of the new buyers. In 
addition, two other partnerships that hold an interest in the casino will have 
an opportunity to match the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions about the sale are the latest chapter in the government's long 
and embarrassing venture into the casino business. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government seized the Bicycle Club in April, 1990, after prosecutors 
proved it was built in part with $12 million in laundered drug money from 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The government expedited sale of its casino interest this summer after The 
Times reported that the Asian games manager had been indicted on extortion and 
loan sharking charges, and the Justice Department had to pay its share of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for tax violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is of the essence," the government stressed in sale documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the government had been involved in the club for more than four 
years, the winning bid was announced just several weeks after an advertisement 
soliciting buyers was placed in the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the general partner of Club Acquisition Partners, Santa Monica attorney 
Richard Schneider, was identified. The price was not disclosed. The government 
and the purchasers had entered into a confidentiality agreement until the deal 
is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 According to records and interviews, the winning investment group included 
Hollywood producers Bernard Brillstein and Brad Grey; business managers Nancy 
Chapman, Terry Bird and Bonnie Grey; several Century City attorneys; investment 
banker Llewellyn Werner, a former aide to Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr.; and 
Bertram M. Lee, a Washington businessman and a former owner of the Denver 
Nuggets basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear who put up the $1-million deposit for the group. But Werner said 
his merchant banking firm plans to raise the funds necessary to complete the 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Other investors contacted by The Times referred calls to Schneider, who has 
declined to discuss the partners. But he indicated that some changes in the 
group may occur before the deal is final. 
</P>
<P>
 When the government put its casino interest up for sale, prospective buyers 
were directed to contact Richard at his Las Vegas office. Sources said there 
were several finalists in the bidding, including a Native American tribe from 
Arizona and the Hollywood Park racetrack, which owns but does not operate a 
glitzy new card casino in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisowski, whom Richard hired to provide legal advice for $107,000 a year, said 
that his office only sent out information regarding the club to prospective 
bidders and that he answered inquiries from half a dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really not involved in the bid process, and neither was Mr. Richard," 
he said. "The government walled us off. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard, who is paid $200,000 in salary and expenses a year to oversee the 
casino for the U.S. Justice Department, said, "I went out and got the offers 
and presented them to the government. My job then ceased. I had no involvement 
in the selection of the (winning) group." 
</P>
<P>
 The choice was made by federal officials from the U.S. attorney's offices in 
Los Angeles and Miami, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Justice Department in 
Washington, according to Miller. Richard and Lisowski were not present. 
</P>
<P>
 A bid from Bicycle Club employees seeking to buy the government's share was 
rejected because a $1-million deposit check bounced and potential licensing 
difficulties arose, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hollywood Park ultimately matched the Santa Monica group's 
$38-million offer, sources said, their bid was rejected because California law 
does not allow a publicly traded corporation to operate a card club. An 
Assembly bill that would have lifted the restriction died Aug. 31, the final 
day of the legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bidder who matched the $38-million offer was disqualified for unknown 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marshals Service, which is responsible for managing the seized asset, only 
conducted a criminal background check of the proposed purchasers and did not 
obtain gaming applications the winning group submitted to the state attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 The group sent a package of 17 registration forms to Sacramento on Aug. 31, 
including a multi-page application from Lisowski, accompanied by the required 
$500 check from the attorney for a routine background investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisowski checked two boxes indicating that he was applying as a new owner and 
a manager of the Bicycle Club. His affiliation was to take effect when the 
investment group's license was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 He listed the previous owner as the United States government. 
</P>
<P>
 He and all of the other applicants identified Richard as the proposed manager, 
according to the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the applications did not indicate the amount that each owner would 
invest, the attorney general's office was unable to determine immediately who 
actually is buying the government's share of the Bicycle Club. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the applications were "incomplete and will require additional data to 
be provided by the applicants," said Whitt Murray, assistant chief of the 
attorney general's Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether he applied for licensing, Lisowski said, "I might have. I 
probably did. . . . I filled out something. . . . I remember filling out the 
application." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisowski said he did so because Richard told him to submit it. He said there 
was concern that pending state legislation to tighten regulation of card clubs 
and create a state gaming commission would impose a temporary blackout on 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter withdrawing the application, Lisowski noted that the bill did 
not pass the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard said he may have talked with Lisowski about the desirability of the 
attorney's registering himself as a casino manager before any restrictive 
legislation could be passed. But he said he was unaware that Lisowski put in an 
ownership application. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't ever tell him to do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard said he had no idea why the partnership members would list him as 
their manager. He said Schneider, the general partner, had asked him whether he 
would be interested in the job. "I said, 'Yes, I would be.' We would talk about 
it after the (final purchase) contract had been signed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bicycle Club is not the first place that Richard -- a 55-year-old former 
casino executive and retired Air Force officer -- and Lisowski, 40, have worked 
together. In Las Vegas, Richard was brought in as the general manager of the 
bankrupt Main Street Station Casino in 1992, and Lisowski provided legal advice 
on gambling and bankruptcy matters. 
</P>
<P>
 When Richard was named trustee of the Bicycle Club last year, he soon brought 
in Lisowski for legal help. "We just got along well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 180 gaming tables, the Bicycle Club grosses nearly $90 million a year and 
provides the majority of funding for the city of Bell Gardens. The federal 
government has received at least $25 million in profits from its controlling 
interest in one of two partnerships that own the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the sale can be completed, the other members of these two partnerships 
will have an opportunity to reject the offer by Club Acquisition Partners and 
match its winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials, uncomfortable with being in the casino business, look 
forward to closing a deal. "This case has been like the tar baby," said one 
source. "Every time you touch it, it sticks to you." The Casino Deal 
</P>
<P>
 After seizing one of California's biggest card clubs fours years ago, the 
federal government has entered into an agreement to sell its controlling 
interest in the Bicycle Club Casino of Bell Gardens to a new Santa Monica 
investment group. Two men who oversaw the government's interest and helped 
handle the sale were listed on gaming applications by the buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Offers to buy the government's share in the casino were solicited in a Wall 
Street Journal ad. Interested parties were instructed to contact the 
government's trustee, Harry J. Richard, at his Las Vegas office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard's attorney on Bicycle Club issues, James F. Lisowski, Sr., 
maintained his law office at the same Las Vegas address. Lisowski and Richard 
presented bids from prospective buyers to the federal officials who selected 
the winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
 * After the government selected Club Acquisition Partners, Lisowski applied to 
the state attorney general for a gaming registration. He listed himself as one 
of the proposed new owners and managers of the Bicycle Club. He also listed 
Richard as manager. Lisowski said Friday that his application is being 
withdrawn.

MONO LAKE PLAN COULD SLASH L.A. WATER SUPPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A long-awaited state report on the future of Mono Lake recommends that the 
water level of the environmentally fragile lake be restored to a high 
elevation, a move that could dramatically slash the amount of water that will 
flow to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation, contained in an environmental impact statement prepared by 
the staff of the state Water Resources Control Board, was hailed by 
environmentalists, who have fought for 15 years to protect the lake from being 
drained. But officials in Los Angeles called it a major blow to their efforts 
to retain an important source of drinking water for the city's 3 million 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposal is enacted by the board, the salt lake on the eastern edge of 
Yosemite National Park and its wildlife would be permanently protected. The 
plan is scheduled for a vote by the water board Sept. 28 and approval is widely 
expected because Gov. Pete Wilson has expressed support after pushing for Mono 
Lake protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Although barred by a court order from pumping water from the Mono Basin since 
1989, Los Angeles drew as much as 15% of its water from the lake region's 
mountain streams in prior years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the report released Friday, the city could gradually resume taking small 
quantities from the basin when water levels rise at least two feet above 
current levels. But the report says it could take decades before the city 
starts pumping significant amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 If the persistent drought plaguing the Sierra Nevada continues, "it could mean 
there is no water taken out of the Mono Basin for 30 years," said James 
Wickser, assistant general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report, the water resources staff said their "preferred alternative" is 
to raise Mono Lake to an average elevation of 6,392 feet -- the level 
environmentalists have long advocated. Los Angeles had wanted the average 
elevation set 15 feet lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the lake hovers around 6,375 feet. State water officials project it 
will take 20 years to reach the recommended elevation, explaining it takes that 
long for sufficient snowmelt to flow from the slopes of the eastern Sierra 
Nevada to replenish the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 But under the proposal, Los Angeles would be allowed to pump limited amounts 
as soon as the lake reaches 6,377 feet -- which could take years, depending on 
drought conditions. At that time, the city could pump about 5% of the amount it 
once took. If the elevation rises three feet more, the amount increases to 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effects of the preferred alternative on Los Angeles will be greatest in 
the early years when Mono Basin diversions are most severely restricted," the 
board's report says. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak, the Mono Basin supplied 95,000 acre-feet of water -- equivalent 
to 18% of the city's current consumption, Wickser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wickser said Los Angeles residents spend about $38 million a year to replace 
the lost Mono water with increased purchases from the Metropolitan Water 
District, which collects and imports water from the San Joaquin River Delta and 
the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 Although environmentalists said they were encouraged by Friday's environmental 
impact statement, they are still awaiting crucial details such as 
implementation during drought years and whether the city must restore damaged 
trout streams. That information will be released Tuesday in the state staff's 
full proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next week is really the important moment where we find out exactly what the 
board is proposing. But this certainly is encouraging," said Martha Davis, 
executive director of the Mono Lake Committee, an environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for its unusual, craggy tufa formations, Mono Lake has been a subject of 
long, bitter conflict between the city defending its water rights and 
environmentalists and High Sierra residents trying to protect migratory birds, 
endangered aquatic life such as brine shrimp and lake-fed trout streams. 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous lawsuits by environmentalists charging that Los Angeles had 
been illegally draining the basin for years, state courts in a series of 
rulings over the past decade invalidated the city's long-held claim to Mono 
Lake's water. The state water board was ordered to devise new rules for the 
basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting the Mono Basin "is important to this state because our river 
systems and their water quality are the vein of the health of this state," said 
Jim Edmondson of CalTrout, a statewide fishing and environmental group that 
sued the city to stem the flow of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Los Angeles is now given the opportunity to be a good neighbor to 
the state's environment and to the fish and wildlife that environment supports 
and lastly to the rural counties who depend upon a high-quality environment for 
their tourism and economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating that the city would lose a substantial amount of Mono Lake water 
permanently, the state Legislature in June allocated the first $9 million 
toward $36 million in reclaimed water projects for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "These water projects are right here in our own back yard and they are much 
more reliable supplies," Davis said. "We're building a more secure water future 
for Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials said all Southern Californians could be hurt if the 
water board approves the recommendation. If Los Angeles must buy more water 
from MWD, less is available for other counties and cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California also stands to lose water from another major source -- the 
San Joaquin delta -- soon because new environmental standards have been 
proposed there as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a city of L.A. issue because of the interconnection between us 
and the Metropolitan Water District and all of Southern California," Wickser 
said. "Los Angeles will pay the money for the replacement water, but the entire 
southern part of the state will feel the impacts of shortfalls of water." 
</P>
<P>
 Wickser said Los Angeles residents have cut their water consumption through 
conservation and reclaimed water use, but that unused supply was to have 
accommodated anticipated population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now going to have to use what we set aside for future growth because of 
what we will lose at the Mono Basin," Wickser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have almost 20 years of history where the lake has been at or below that 
elevation and the brine shrimp and birds are at higher numbers than ever 
recorded in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmondson, however, said the higher water level is needed to protect four 
trout streams.

CARTER MISSION PRESSES HAITI'S LEADERS TO LEAVE; CARIBBEAN: WHITE HOUSE CALLS 
FIRST MEETING 'SERIOUS AND CONSTRUCTIVE.' TWO NIGHT SESSIONS ARE ALSO HELD; 
MORE ARE EXPECTED TODAY. U.S. FORCES ARE IN PLACE OFF THE COAST.

<P>
 In what President Clinton called "one last, best effort" to avoid bloodshed, a 
delegation led by former President Jimmy Carter met with Haiti's top military 
leaders into the early hours this morning, hoping to persuade them to step 
aside rather than face an invasion by the huge U.S. force poised offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side indicated whether any progress was made in the first round of 
talks, which lasted about three hours Saturday afternoon. Outside, a crowd of 
demonstrators opposed to Clinton's goal of restoring ousted Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide chanted, "Democracy, yes, Aristide, no." 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the meeting with the U.S. delegation, which included Sen. 
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, a defiant Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras, the nation's military leader, stepped onto a balcony, smiling and 
waving to the hundreds of supporters below. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House provided little detail about the afternoon talks other than to 
say they were "serious and constructive." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. delegation's talks with Cedras resumed after a dinner with important 
members of Haiti's wealthy elite and other supporters of the military regime. 
On his way to the night meeting, which lasted into the early morning hours, 
Carter said he was "hopeful, that's all."  
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Carter said, "I have nothing to say tonight. . . . We are 
continuing to work." Further meetings were expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 As a motorcade whisked the three Americans to the night meeting, the streets 
of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, were virtually empty under a partial 
curfew. The city was darkened by a lack of electricity, and some sporadic 
shooting was reported in the downtown area. Soldiers manning roadblocks in and 
out of Port-au-Prince had taken off their uniforms and were in civilian clothes 
as part of the military's apparent plans to "evaporate" in the event of an 
invasion, but the troops showed no signs of nervousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. delegation arrived in Port-au-Prince as preparations neared a climax 
for an invasion that appeared imminent. U.S. military commanders met Clinton in 
the Pentagon "war room" to outline their detailed plans for military action. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department announced that all elements of an invasion force are 
now in place off the coast of Haiti. Defense Secretary William J. Perry flew to 
the Caribbean to visit the troops that are prepared to seize Haiti from the 
military government that has ruled the island nation since the overthrow of 
Aristide in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army called nine reserve units and a National Guard company to active 
service, the first reservists to be activated out of about 1,600 that were put 
on alert Thursday. Because a reserve call-up so disrupts the lives of the 
individual reservists, their families and their employers, it was considered to 
be a sign of the seriousness of Clinton's determination to invade in the 
absence of any deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday evening, Clinton told the Congressional Black Caucus, the one 
congressional group that has supported his plans to invade Haiti, that "the 
time for idle discussion has ended. There is still a little time for serious 
discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 "The mission is still in Haiti; let us hope for its success," Clinton said. 
"But whatever happens, let us resolve that we will stand against violations of 
human rights and terrorism in our neighborhood, we will stand for democracy, 
and we will keep our commitments and expect those who make commitments to us to 
keep theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Clinton would not give 
Cedras a chance to put off the invasion by dragging out his talks with Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not be delayed. I will not be deterred," Myers quoted Clinton as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said Carter's only mandate on his mission is to 
persuade Haiti's three top military leaders -- Cedras, Brig. Gen. Philippe 
Biamby and Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois -- to surrender power and leave the 
impoverished nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The former President expects to leave Haiti today. Upon his arrival there 
Saturday, he was known to be optimistic that Cedras, Biamby and Francois would 
accompany him aboard his U.S. Air Force jetliner on their way into exile. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say the three military leaders have sent conflicting signals, 
sometimes indicating they are ready to give up in the face of the overwhelming 
power of the invasion force but at other times vowing to fight to the death. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said the White House had received at least one credible report 
suggesting that Cedras had indicated Friday that he might be willing to leave 
Haiti without a fight, but by Saturday morning he had changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), a member of the House Intelligence 
Committee who met with Cedras in Haiti in late July, said Saturday that he had 
received a written message from the military leader "that suggests he's 
disposed to negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said Cedras wanted assurances that the military leaders and their 
families could leave the country in safety for exile, that there would be no 
retaliation against soldiers loyal to the military regime and that the military 
leaders could return to Haiti some day. He said Cedras also wanted to be sure 
that he would have access to frozen bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said most of the conditions were acceptable, although the 
United States was unwilling to assure Cedras that he would be permitted to 
return to Haiti. The U.S. position is that the general should leave the island. 
It would be up to the restored Aristide government to decide if he would ever 
be allowed back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cedras has political ambitions," Richardson said. "He wants to return and run 
for president some day. Certainly not in the immediate future. He thinks of 
himself as popular in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should be flexible there so long as their departure does not harm 
Aristide in his tenure in office," the lawmaker added. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. delegation arrived in Port-au-Prince aboard an Air Force Boeing 707, 
the type Carter used as Air Force One when he was in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his arrival, Carter told reporters that he was in Haiti on "a very simple 
but very important mission . . . to devise a peaceful implementation" of the 
U.N. Security Council resolution calling for Aristide's restoration to power. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Carter mystified and angered Administration officials by publicly 
claiming to have brokered an agreement between the United States and North 
Korea before sending a full report to the President. Although the White House 
later embraced the Carter-mediated Korean compromise, Clinton and Carter were 
clearly determined to avoid that sort of confusion this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton emphasized that the only issue Carter and his delegation could discuss 
was whether Cedras, Biamby and Francois would step down peacefully or be driven 
from power. 
</P>
<P>
 In his regular Saturday morning radio broadcast, Clinton said Carter, Nunn, 
who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Powell, a former 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were sent "to make one last best effort 
to provide a peaceful, orderly transfer of power, to minimize the loss of life 
and to maximize the chances of security for all Haitians and, of course, for 
our own troops and the coalition force." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Haitian leaders, Clinton said: "Their time is up. The remaining 
question is not whether they will leave, but how they will leave. They can go 
peacefully and increase the chances for a peaceful future and a more stable 
future for Haiti in the near term, not only for all those whose democracy they 
stole, but for themselves as well. They can do that, or they will be removed by 
force." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was accompanied by Vice President Al Gore on his visit to the Pentagon 
"war room," officially known as the National Military Command Center, where 
Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the chiefs 
of the individual services briefed them on military preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done an excellent job," Gore said as he left the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon announced that the aircraft carriers America and Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, the final elements of a powerful 18-warship armada, arrived off the 
coast of Haiti on Saturday. About 6,000 troops, the vanguard of an invasion 
force expected to total 20,000, were aboard the ships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is in place," Pentagon spokesman Dennis Boxx said. "The gun is 
cocked." 
</P>
<P>
 In Port-au-Prince, hundreds of Haitians fled the capital in advance of the 
expected invasion. News agency reports said the families of military leaders, 
including the wife and children of Francois, the capital police chief, had 
crossed the border into the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, thousands of residents of Port-au-Prince's fetid slums -- 
Aristide's staunchest supporters -- boarded trucks and broken-down buses in an 
effort to reach the relative safety of the countryside. Backers of the ousted 
president expressed fear that they would be the targets of attack by the 
7,000-member Haitian army, which is no match for the invaders but could still 
exact revenge against unarmed civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton has lined up 24 nations to contribute token contingents of 
troops to the predominantly U.S. invasion force, the President's decision to 
use force to remove the Haitian dictators if they do not step down peacefully 
remained unpopular on Capitol Hill and with the American public. 
</P>
<P>
 A Time Magazine/CNN poll released Saturday showed that 58% of the public 
opposed the use of force in Haiti, despite Clinton's appeal for support in a 
nationally televised address Thursday evening. Only 27% said the troops should 
be sent in, even less than the 30% who supported an invasion two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican response to Clinton's radio speech, Rep. Bob Livingston 
(R-La.) denounced Aristide as a leftist and said the United States should do 
nothing to help him regain power.

U.S. CEDING UPPER HAND TO N. KOREA, CRITICS SAY; ASIA: WASHINGTON WANTS 
PYONGYANG'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM FROZEN. BUT ITS CONCESSIONS COULD INVALIDATE ANY 
DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The outlines of a deal between the United States and North Korea are slowly 
emerging, and critics say they aren't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a bargain to stop the fast-growing North Korean nuclear program, 
the Clinton Administration has quietly made concessions that could permit the 
program's resumption on short notice, outside analysts say, even though it 
would be frozen for the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the isolated Pyongyang regime will retain "a latent ability to 
break out of this deal if they feel it is unsatisfactory," said Jonathan 
Pollack, a Korea expert at the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they do, maintained Henry Sokolski, a former Pentagon specialist on 
non-proliferation, "North Korea would still be producing new plutonium in the 
reactor it had before and be able to make at least as many bombs as it now 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA estimates North Korea has already produced enough nuclear material for 
one to two bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and North Korea began to move toward a settlement of the 
nuclear crisis in a vague, conditional agreement signed Aug. 12 after talks in 
Geneva. Those talks are scheduled to resume Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the deal sketched out last month, the United States said it is prepared to 
take steps toward diplomatic recognition of North Korea and to supply it with 
new, less dangerous nuclear technology if North Korea will freeze its nuclear 
program and will rejoin the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty provides for international safeguards to prevent development of 
nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials argue that the emerging deal is of tremendous benefit 
to the United States and its allies, primarily because it would eliminate what 
Robert L. Gallucci, the top U.S. negotiator with Pyongyang, regularly calls 
North Korea's "strategic" nuclear capability -- the ability to produce regular, 
large amounts of nuclear fuel that it could use to make bombs or export to 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 But an examination of the fine print of the written agreement signed by U.S. 
and North Korean officials last month and the public explanations they have 
offered since shows that, for a number of the promised gains won by the 
Administration, there were significant qualifications or concessions: 
</P>
<P>
 * North Korea would halt construction of two huge new nuclear reactors. But 
its existing, smaller reactor at Yongbyon -- which has already been used to 
produce plutonium, a key ingredient for nuclear weapons -- would be left 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 * North Korea has agreed to "seal" its reprocessing plant, which could turn 
spent nuclear fuel into plutonium. But so far, there is no guarantee that this 
reprocessing facility would be dismantled in the fashion the United States 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 8,000 rods of spent nuclear fuel removed from the Yongbyon plant in 
the spring would be sealed or encased for protection. Yet instead of the rods' 
being shipped out of the country for disposal, as the Administration had 
wanted, U.S. officials have begun to acknowledge that they could be kept in 
North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Clinton Administration is still insisting that North Korea submit to 
special international inspections, which would clear up what North Korea has 
done in its nuclear program. But the Administration also has begun to make 
concessions about the timing of the inspections, admitting they can be put off 
for now and perhaps for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our view that the actual implementation of special inspections, which 
we recognize is a serious political issue for (North Korea), need not be 
undertaken immediately for a settlement to be successful," Gallucci said at a 
press briefing earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Postponement of the special inspections is significant, because they are the 
issue that sparked the Korea crisis in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, after the International Atomic Energy Agency asked to inspect 
two sites in North Korea that officials felt might contain telltale nuclear 
wastes, Pyongyang countered by announcing its withdrawal from the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of the deal now being envisioned by the Administration would bring 
North Korea back into the treaty. But the deal would also mean that North Korea 
has won extensive talks with the United States and the first moves toward 
diplomatic recognition and economic help before it goes along with the special 
inspections the IAEA originally sought. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials point out that North Korea will not get the big final payoff -- 
a $4-billion light-water nuclear facility produced with foreign technology and 
financing -- until it goes along with the special inspections and explains how 
much weapons-grade nuclear fuel it has already produced. 
</P>
<P>
 The light-water reactor itself will take an estimated six to 10 years to 
complete, so the special inspections could be done during this extended period. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who defend the proposed agreement are not worried about the delay. "If 
this deal works, the question of the past will take care of itself over time," 
asserted Robert Manning of the Progressive Policy Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 But some skeptics contend that the proposed deal won't accomplish much. "In 
some very profound sense, we are exactly where we were when this whole crisis 
began," Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year of talks, North Korea will be back in the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty without submitting to special inspections now or anytime soon. And it 
will have at hand, and ready for renewed use, much of its current materials and 
technology if it decides to resume the weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did the Administration decide to make such a deal? How did it find itself 
giving benefits and asking its allies in Seoul and Tokyo to contribute still 
more rewards to have North Korea finally comply with the international rules it 
was supposed to obey in early 1993? 
</P>
<P>
 The first factor, analysts say, is that the Administration had surprisingly 
few weapons in its arsenal to pressure North Korea. Administration officials 
made it plain that they did not want to get into a war with North Korea that, 
by Pentagon estimates, would be winnable but result in tens of thousands of 
U.S. casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 And, last spring, the United States found that it would be difficult, if not 
impossible, to persuade China and Japan to go along with economic sanctions 
against Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, said Douglas Paal, a former George Bush Administration official 
who now heads the Asia Pacific Policy Center, North Korea now "senses that the 
United States will seek an agreement at any price." 
</P>
<P>
 The second factor affecting the Administration is the underlying belief among 
many in Washington that North Korea's Communist regime probably will fall apart 
in the next few years, so the promised economic benefits may not have to be 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 With the death last July of President Kim Il Sung, North Korea faces a 
difficult transition to new political leadership at a time when its economy is 
steadily declining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is on our side," argued one congressional source, echoing sentiments 
voiced elsewhere in Washington. "As long as we can maintain the current freeze 
and continue talking, it is to our advantage. I think we're never going to see 
a light-water reactor up and running in North Korea, because there's a good 
chance there won't be a North Korea at the time it is ready." 
</P>
<P>
 The third factor underlying the deal is Pyongyang's tough, clever negotiating 
tactics: The rapid, continuing pace of the North Korean nuclear program put the 
Administration in the position of having to struggle just to maintain the 
status quo and prevent the situation from getting worse. Thus, one of the main 
concessions won by the Administration in Geneva was to prevent North Korea from 
finishing new nuclear reactors that are much bigger than the ones they already 
have. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Clinton Administration has been forced to try to figure out what 
should be done with the 8,000 highly radioactive fuel rods North Korea suddenly 
removed from the Yongbyon reactor in the spring. In taking that nuclear fuel 
from the reactor, North Korea created a major new problem that didn't exist a 
year ago -- and used it to extract further concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's pattern of first creating problems and then bargaining them away 
is likely to continue. Indeed, some experts warn that in the next few weeks, 
North Korea could use these fuel rods to try to extract some more concessions 
from the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The North Koreans are deliberately letting the spent fuel deteriorate," said 
a Washington-based diplomat who follows North Korea. "A few weeks from now, the 
North Koreans could say that these rods are deteriorating so fast that they 
have to be reprocessed (into plutonium). That would be the next round of 
brinkmanship, and the United States would be at a disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks since the August agreement, Administration officials have devoted 
most of their efforts toward trying to organize and work out specifics of the 
economic package they will offer to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest of these is the proposed light-water reactor -- which would supply 
nuclear power with technology that cannot easily be used for nuclear weapons -- 
because the reactor produces a much lower quality of plutonium than the 
gas-graphite reactors North Korea is now using. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the United States has been quietly trying to put together a 
consortium of countries or companies to supply the technology for this reactor 
and to finance the $4-billion project. 
</P>
<P>
 That effort is in some ways a mammoth dispute over construction and design 
contracts. "It's not clear how the consortium would work," one U.S. official 
said recently. "I think it'll be a combination of South Korea, Japan and 
Germany." 
</P>
<P>
 But another U.S. official said he doubts that South Korea, which will provide 
most of the financing for the project, will be willing to help pay for North 
Korea to get any German technology. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials admit that one of the biggest unresolved problems is that the 
Administration will have to get clearance from Congress for South Korea to 
supply light-water reactors to Pyongyang. Some U.S. laws forbid exports to 
North Korea, and other laws restrict the re-export of American-licensed nuclear 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is going to have to be some nuclear cooperation agreement between the 
United States and North Korea," said one congressional source. "That's a dicey 
proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also has been quietly trying to work out details of another 
benefit it promised North Korea in writing last month in Geneva -- that the 
United States will arrange for "interim" energy supplies for North Korea in the 
years before the light-water reactor is built.

ON CALIFORNIA: TODAY VERSUS TOMORROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My grandparents are gone now, and so I cannot ask them about the old days. I 
cannot ask what made their generation so different. They helped create much of 
what is California today. With tax dollars and ballot box mandates, they helped 
build the freeways, waterways and, most important, public schools. They did 
this without much complaint, and even after their own children were grown, gone 
from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they believed that they owed it, that one generation was obligated to 
create a better place for the next. Perhaps they had political leaders who 
pushed them. Pat Brown was one, and I recall reading a speech he gave early on 
as governor. Disgruntled business executives had come to complain about taxes 
and make threats about moving on. Brown answered with a call for even more 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke of building more schools and infrastructure, not to meet immediate 
needs, but to ensure "a greater future." He spoke of developing water and 
electrical plants: "We may not like new taxes, but the alternative is a weak 
California burdened with fears, handicapped by inadequate state services and 
threatened with debt. Industry would not thrive in such an unhealthy economic 
climate." 
</P>
<P>
 Try to imagine a governor saying that today, to us, in this California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this California, we have a governor, Pete Wilson, who openly embraces the 
idea -- a dubious usage -- of booting children from school because their 
parents lack the proper paperwork. This is crafty politics, catering to a 
collective unease about shifting demographics. How it might affect future 
generations is less than clear, although a safe guess is that xenophobia will 
not be the most useful trait to take into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 In this California, elected officials coddle businesses. They cut taxes, roll 
back worker safety laws, relax pollution controls. Anything to keep the CEOs 
content. This is done to great applause. If the companies stay, it means maybe 
no more jobs will be lost. As for industrial pollution and worker safety and 
the tax base -- well, our children and grandchildren can tackle those little 
leftovers later, on their own watch. 
</P>
<P>
 In this California, no one dares advocate attacking the root causes of crime 
-- too messy, too hard, bad politics. Better to crank up the punishment, create 
at least the appearance of response. And so prisons are built at a pace unknown 
to the civilized world, while Sacramento legislators churn out "anti-crime" 
measures like the "three strikes" charade. To keep up, something like 25 new 
prisons will be required in the next five years. This will cost billions upon 
billions of dollars, and who says the money might be better spent on schools? 
</P>
<P>
 No, in this California, a state that once taught the nation how to educate 
children, people snicker about the sorry state of the public school system. It 
is considered a major accomplishment in Sacramento when funding can be 
maintained at current cracker state levels. Free college education, once a 
California birthright, is now considered a luxury, beyond our means. Jack up 
the fees. Let the kids pay their own way. So what if we didn't? This is 
different. This is today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this California, Wilson has dug out of a deep hole to overtake Kathleen 
Brown. A Times Poll last week indicated that the incumbent is well-positioned 
on three of four major issues -- crime, immigration, economics. This was no 
surprise. Wilson might lack vision. He might, as a transplanted Midwesterner, 
not fathom what it once meant to come of age in California. Still, he knows how 
to push hot buttons, play to immediate fears. He knows the politics of today. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is how the campaign, so far, has been framed. The big issues have 
been debated in the present tense, with scant reference to the future. Crime is 
about punishment, not prevention. Immigration is about deporting children, not 
about our role in a new, more complicated world. The economic debate concerns 
how to appease old industry, not create new. Save our skins today, that has 
been the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the poll, the sole issue on which Brown demonstrated strength was 
education. This was seen as weakness by those who interpret polls: Wilson can 
talk about locking up criminals, shunning immigrants, rescuing business. The 
fun stuff. His opponent is stuck with schools. And yet, Brown might have more 
running room than anyone imagines. 
</P>
<P>
 Education is fundamentally about the future -- a tomorrow issue. Brown still 
has enough time and talent to play to this strength, to move the debate off the 
grim present and show this state what tomorrow could bring, to rekindle 
whatever it was that burned in earlier Californians, like my grandparents. Do 
this, and the race again becomes hers to lose. And here she has an advantage. 
The grandfather of her children is still around to tell her how he did it, in 
the old days.

U.S. WEIGHING CONTROVERSIAL BORDER CROSSING FEE, RENO SAYS; CHECKPOINTS: IN 
BEVERLY HILLS SPEECH, SHE UNVEILS PROGRAM TO CLOSE 'REVOLVING DOOR FOR ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno announced Saturday that a controversial proposal to 
impose fees for crossing the Mexican border is under serious consideration by 
the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno's comments came during a Beverly Hills address in which she unveiled a 
federal program designed to close California's "revolving door for illegal 
immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, dubbed Operation Gatekeeper, will: 
</P>
<P>
 * Use hundreds of new and redeployed federal officers to patrol the Mexican 
border -- a move that will result in at least temporary closure of a busy 
inland immigration checkpoint at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 * Institute an automated fingerprinting system to catch criminal immigrants 
and track habitual illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase fencing and lighting at the San Diego border. 
</P>
<P>
 "The days when the border served as a revolving door for illegal immigrants 
are over," Reno told a receptive Town Hall audience at the Beverly Hilton 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said Operation Gatekeeper includes plans to send federal funds to 
California to help cover the costs of incarcerating criminal illegal 
immigrants. But those funds were already called for under the new federal crime 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most controversial element of Reno's speech involved something not 
included in Operation Gatekeeper -- the proposal to impose border crossing 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it would take an act of Congress to implement such fees, Reno stated: 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seriously considering implementing a . . . crossing fee similar to 
fees already collected at all airports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later this month, the Commission on Immigration Reform . . . plans to 
recommend the initiation of such a fee," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds from the fees, Reno said, would be used to patrol the border and for 
expenses connected with legal crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fees -- $1 per crossing is often recommended -- have been the subject of 
heated debate for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics maintain that such a border tariff could actually increase illegal 
entries by people who can't afford to pay. It has also been suggested that 
immigration officials would be too busy exchanging dollars for pesos to 
concentrate on more important duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Instituting such a fee could also require delicate negotiations with Mexico, 
critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, border fees are attractive to Republican and Democratic members 
of Congress, who are seeking new sources of income to meet border-related 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) proposed such a fee last year and rejected 
criticism as "tired bureaucratic responses." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been estimated that a crossing charge of $1 would raise about $400 
million a year, said Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, who accompanied Reno in Los Angeles and on an afternoon 
visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Gatekeeper also calls for a pilot project that will close the 
controversial checkpoint at San Clemente as soon as next week and move most of 
the 95 agents who operate the station to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 70 officers who operate another such checkpoint at Temecula will 
also be reassigned to the border under the pilot project. It was not 
immediately clear whether the post at Temecula will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is a sensible evaluation that shows how the people 
deployed at checkpoints could be used most effectively," Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoints have long been the focus of criticism from civil libertarians, 
local residents and commuters. Even many immigration officials say the agents 
would be better deployed at the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for the checkpoints' continued operation has come mainly from 
immigration officers for whom inland stations represent promotion opportunities 
and an alternative to grueling border duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift of agents from San Clemente and Temecula represents a major step 
toward the potential phasing out of one or both checkpoints, Justice Department 
officials said Saturday. A final decision could come before the end of the 
year, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Political pressure for the border buildup has resulted partly from the success 
of a "blockade" in El Paso, where a show of force along the Rio Grande has 
dramatically cut illegal crossing. In contrast, San Diego agents will be 
deployed in three "tiers" -- a lower-profile strategy that officials hope will 
prove effective while avoiding violence at the volatile Tijuana line. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown, who had recommended 
redeployment of the checkpoint agents to help on the border, said Operation 
Gatekeeper is "a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's opponent, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, has sought to portray her as 
soft on illegal immigration. However, in a statement issued after Reno's 
speech, she tried to counter that image: "It is time we take strong steps to 
stop the flow of illegal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had nothing good to say about Reno's plan, commenting through a 
spokesman that it was a "Band-Aid for a hemorrhage." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson Press Secretary Sean Walsh said incarcerating criminal illegal 
immigrants costs California $475 million a year, while the state will receive 
only a share of the $130 million earmarked for all states that incur such 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a question about Proposition 187, which would deny public 
education and health care to illegal immigrants, Reno said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at the children of America and the children in trouble and it doesn't 
solve the problems by denying them health care, it doesn't solve the problems 
by denying them counseling and it doesn't solve the problems by denying them 
education."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / REPUBLICAN CONVENTION; STRESSING GOP UNITY, WILSON BACKS 
PROP. 187; GOVERNOR GETS WARM RECEPTION AT STATE PARTY GATHERING AS HE FORMALLY 
ENDORSES THE IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE AND PREDICTS SWEEPING REPUBLICAN VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, warmly embraced by leaders of a once-reluctant California 
Republican Party, declared Saturday that he had fought like a "junkyard dog" to 
turn California around from economic recession, violent crime and the fiscal 
burden of uncontrolled illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's what I have done," Wilson said as he made his case to the 
Republican state convention for a second term and formally embraced the No. 1 
cause of the Republican conservatives with whom he has battled over most of his 
45 months as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson officially endorsed Proposition 187, the voter initiative that seeks to 
cut off free health care, public schooling and other state-paid benefits to 
illegal immigrants. The governor, facing a Democratic challenge from state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, has fought without success to get the federal 
government to honor its commitment to reimburse California for the cost of such 
services, estimated at from $1.8 billion to $3 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson belittled the border control efforts of the Clinton Administration -- 
including those proposed Saturday by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno -- and labeled Brown 
as "Bill Clinton's chief apologist in California." 
</P>
<P>
 And he predicted that passage of the immigration measure would reverberate in 
Washington and elsewhere with the same force as Proposition 13, the property 
tax initiative of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187, the Save Our State initiative, is the 2-by-4 we need to . . 
. finally force Washington to accept its responsibility for illegal 
immigration," Wilson said in a speech that was interrupted by applause more 
than 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 750 attending the luncheon stood and clapped when Wilson announced 
his endorsement of Proposition 187. They briefly chanted, "Four more years." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he feels the electricity of a potential GOP victory that he said 
could reach well down the ticket and into the Democratic strongholds of 
California's U.S. House delegation and the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the best chance to make this a Republican victory the like of which 
we have not seen literally since Ronald Reagan swept in every constitutional 
officer but one," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in 1966, when Wilson, then a 33-year-old former advance man for 
Republican President Richard Nixon, was elected to the state Assembly from his 
adopted hometown of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent political observers said Wilson's address was one of the most 
skillful political speeches of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know when I've ever seen him as relaxed and as clearly focused in 
laying out simple themes quickly and clearly," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, 
senior analyst for the Center for Politics and the Economy at Claremont 
Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stoos of Sacramento, one of Wilson's vocal critics from the party's 
conservative wing, said the sense of victory has brought the party together 
under Wilson, although the unity may be only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1992, all we smelled at the top of the ticket (with then-President George 
Bush) was big trouble," said Stoos, vice president of the conservative 
California Republican Assembly. "1992 was a big lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoos added that he thought the Wilson camp had "gone out of its way" to avoid 
agitating conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving as San Diego mayor and winning election twice to the U.S. 
Senate, Wilson ran for governor as a moderate in 1990. He proposed preventive 
government programs such as health screening for school pupils and prenatal 
exams for poor pregnant women. He backed abortion rights and gay rights and 
espoused environmental causes such as a ban on offshore oil drilling, angering 
conservative party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 His speech Saturday was conservative and tough: Tough on crime and "dangerous 
thugs," tough on welfare recipients, unyielding on the immigration issue, and 
scornful of the Democratic Administration in Washington and the Brown 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson vowed to cut off welfare to those who won't work, saying, "Welfare 
should be a safety net, not a hammock." 
</P>
<P>
 He called Brown "callously insensitive" to the people's desire for a crackdown 
on violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said the Clinton Administration's "tinkering" with border control 
measures was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that falls short of securing our borders and providing full 
reimbursement for California's costs for illegal immigration just ain't 
enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech also marked Wilson's ascendancy as the leader of a united party 
that is buoyed by the smell of victory Nov. 8 -- a dramatic turnaround from the 
GOP's longstanding internal battles over social issues and the sense it was 
headed for disaster in the 1992 election. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Wilson often shunned the role of titular party leader to avoid 
becoming embroiled in its bitter and emotional wars. He did not even attend the 
pre-election state convention two years ago, saying his time was more 
profitably spent out in the field working to elect GOP legislative candidates. 
His aides also wanted to keep him from being caught up in another bitter clash 
over the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
 There is residual anger among conservatives, who generally dominate the state 
party apparatus, about Wilson's positions on abortion and gay rights and his 
approval of higher taxes to deal with the state fiscal crisis in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor still supports a woman's choice on abortion, but has taken a 
no-new-taxes pledge and scaled back his support of rights for gays. 
Environmental issues generally are absent from his 1994 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Wilson echoed the optimism of most of the 1,500 delegates and 
visitors to the convention about Republican election chances this year, buoyed 
by the growing unpopularity of President Clinton and the inability of Brown to 
articulate issues that will draw votes to her. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson campaign has tapped into public anger over crime and the outflow of 
state money to illegal immigrants at the same time the state has had to cut 
back spending for education and other programs benefiting the general 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson acknowledged that his decisions had not always been popular, but he 
said the people did not elect him in 1990 to "put my finger to the wind" and 
yield to popular opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they sent me there because they knew I would fight for what I believe 
in and fight like a junkyard dog to turn this state around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He summarized his achievements in just five paragraphs, including "the 
toughest crime package in the history of California," job creation, rebuilding 
Los Angeles area freeways in record time after the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake and challenging Washington on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Glaser, a Brown campaign aide, disputed Wilson's successes, noting that 
the money used to rebuild the freeways came from the federal government and 
that the Clinton Administration "has created millions of jobs, in every state 
but California." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson must take responsibility for the failure of job creation efforts in 
California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On immigration, Glaser said Wilson's Senate sponsorship of legislation on 
behalf of California agricultural interests "brought more than 1 million 
illegal immigrants into California and he has abandoned them in a politically 
expedient way in order to serve his reelection campaign."

 As the United States threatened to invade Haiti, Russia was busy in its own 
southern yard Saturday, arranging a cease-fire in one guerrilla war, covertly 
meddling in another and scrambling to prevent an old one from reigniting. 
</P>
<P>
 All three conflicts -- in the former Soviet Central Asian republic of 
Tajikistan and the Caucasus Mountain enclaves of Chechnya and Abkhazia -- have 
been simmering since the end of the Cold War, challenging Russia and its army 
for nearly as long as Haiti's dictatorship has defied Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to control events throughout the former Soviet Union, the Russians 
last week found all three fronts heating up at once. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, they apparently managed to defuse the biggest conflict, helping 
forge a cease-fire between Tajikistan's Moscow-backed government and the 
guerrilla-led opposition after two years of fighting and 20,000 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord, signed in Tehran and reported by Russian news agencies, is to take 
effect as soon as international observers are deployed in Tajikistan. The two 
sides agreed to exchange hundreds of prisoners and to continue talks aimed at 
getting the Tajik opposition, a loose alliance of democrats and Islamic 
fundamentalists, to take part in presidential elections Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing the need to stop the spread of Islam, Russia ordered its troops to 
drive the Tajik alliance from power in October, 1992, and install a clan of 
former Communists. The troops, now numbering 25,000, then stayed to fight off 
the opposition's guerrilla attacks, launched mostly from Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Russian intervention has been controversial at home because of Tajik 
leader Imomali Rakhmonov's dictatorial rule and growing casualties suffered by 
the Russian army. Fighting intensified last week, and four Russian border 
guards died Friday in a land-mine explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking a way out, Russia's Foreign Ministry pressed Rakhmonov early this 
month to postpone the elections, originally set for next Sunday, and to send 
his top deputy to the peace talks in Tehran, which were mediated by U.N. 
officials with Russian and Iranian assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement reported Saturday, U.N. observers will supervise a 
Russian-led peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
 In similar fashion, Russia took sides last year in ethnic conflicts in the 
former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Georgia only to reappear as a 
peacemaker. But the conflict in Georgia's Abkhazia region threatened last week 
to flare anew. 
</P>
<P>
 Abkhazia, an ethnically distinct Black Sea enclave, won de facto independence 
from Georgia a year ago after 13 months of war. After covertly backing the 
Abkhazians, Russia arranged a cease-fire and sent 2,500 peacekeeping troops to 
the Abkhazia-Georgia border in May. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, Russia provoked a conflict by siding with Georgia. Bypassing 
the Abkhazians and the U.N. refugee officials, Russia and Georgia agreed to 
start a wholesale repatriation of 250,000 ethnic Georgians who had fled 
Abkhazia during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Abkhazia, which wants to limit the refugees' return until Georgia recognizes 
its independence, responded by sending 3,000 militiamen to the border. The 
Russians called off the repatriation, but not before some of their troops had 
abandoned their posts to the armed Abkhazians. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin sent Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev to 
Abkhazia to settle the dispute over refugees and save the peace mission. 
Grachev met there Friday with Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba and Georgian 
leader Eduard A. Shevardnadze. It was Shevardnadze's first trip to Abkhazia 
since he fled a year ago on a plane full of defeated and wounded Georgian 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin and the Russian army have asserted the right to station troops across 
the former Soviet Union and to intervene in conflicts. Officials in the West, 
wary that Russian meddling might cause more conflict than it prevents, view the 
peace mission in Abkhazia as a test case. 
</P>
<P>
 Before briefing Yeltsin on his talks, Grachev announced Saturday that the two 
sides had agreed on a tentative plan to repatriate refugees in exchange for the 
withdrawal of Georgian military equipment from the region. He gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials in the region believe the Russians are trying to manipulate the 
flow of refugees to keep Abkhazia from intervening militarily in nearby 
Chechnya, an oil-rich Muslim republic that is part of Russia, on behalf of its 
separatist leader, Gen. Dzhokar Dudayev. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by Chechen terrorist attacks on passenger buses in another part of 
Russia, Moscow has been trying since early August to topple Dudayev by sealing 
off his borders with troops and arming a recently formed Opposition Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But the emboldened opposition has made little headway in sporadic armed 
clashes. On Saturday, news agencies reported from Chechnya that Dudayev's 
forces had advanced on an opposition stronghold 12 miles from the Chechen 
capital but halted after a brief skirmish. One report said that two people were 
killed.

PALESTINIANS WANT TO CONTROL HOLY SITES

<P>
 The Palestinian Authority, in a move sure to infuriate Jordan's King Hussein, 
decided at a meeting Saturday to demand control of holy sites in Jerusalem and 
the West Bank from Amman, Palestinian officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Palestinians will inform Jordan that they want control of the holy 
shrines transferred to them from Jordan," an official said after the 
authority's weekly meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 King Hussein reacted angrily Saturday to Palestinian assertions of 
responsibility for Muslim affairs in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of Islamic awkaf (religious affairs) is too important and dangerous 
to be abused and played with," the king told the state news agency, Petra. 
</P>
<P>
 A Palestinian spokesman said the king's reaction "did not serve coordination."

IRA SUPPORTERS STEP UP DEMANDS THAT BRITISH WITHDRAW FROM ULSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irish Republican Army's political wing, Sinn Fein, on Saturday stepped up 
demands for a complete British military withdrawal from Northern Ireland, 
despite olive branch offers from Prime Minister John Major. 
</P>
<P>
 But politicians and clerics who have contact with armed Protestant extremist 
groups said they thought Major's gestures could help persuade the outlawed 
groups to join a 17-day-old IRA cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinn Fein supporters staged small protests outside heavily fortified security 
bases in Belfast, the province's capital, and held a march in Londonderry, the 
second city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have come here today to move on the (peace) process and take back our 
city. We want an end to the British army in this city. We want them out of here 
. . . as soon as possible," Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness told 
supporters in Londonderry. 
</P>
<P>
 In a minor skirmish in Belfast, teen-agers stoning a military base were hosed 
down with water by security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrations went ahead despite Major's announcement Friday that he was 
lifting a broadcast ban that kept Sinn Fein voices off radio and television for 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
 His efforts were aimed at reassuring the majority pro-British Protestant 
community as well as Roman Catholics, most of whom want the province united 
with the rest of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Major insisted the IRA must still prove it has permanently renounced violence 
in its war against the British. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had a sweetener for Protestants, guaranteeing that the result of future 
peace talks would be put to a referendum in the province. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Protestants have welcomed the plan, seeing it as a pledge that they will 
not be forced out of their union with Britain against their will. But Sinn Fein 
wants any referendum to include a vote in the Irish Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds welcomed Britain's promise of a 
referendum on Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 In a television interview in Hong Kong, Reynolds described the referendum 
announcement as "a considerable contribution toward consolidating and 
solidifying the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 The British and Irish governments are now waiting to see if loyalist 
extremists will lay down their arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The armed extremists have said they will not match the cease-fire until they 
are satisfied that the IRA truce is permanent and convinced that the British 
government has made no secret deals to dilute Northern Ireland's British 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ervine, spokesman for the small Progressive Unionist Party, who speaks 
with members of the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force, said he thought the 
extremists would be pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if the loyalist paramilitaries are convinced of Northern Ireland's 
position, guaranteed as a partner within the United Kingdom, then they will lay 
down their weapons," he told British Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Irish Times in Dublin said Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams will 
start a visit to the United States this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting "reliable" sources in Washington, the newspaper said the Clinton 
Administration has lifted a ban on official contacts with Sinn Fein and will be 
offering Adams a visa.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; LAWMAKERS SUPPORT PEACE MISSION, BUT STILL BALK AT 
INVASION; CONGRESS: CARTER DELEGATION IS APPLAUDED, DESPITE CRITICISM OF ITS 
TIMING AND MANDATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Key members of Congress expressed bipartisan support Saturday for President 
Clinton's last-ditch Haitian diplomatic initiative but warned that they would 
continue to seek a vote opposing an invasion if Clinton's emissaries failed to 
persuade Haiti's military dictators to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I strongly support this mission," said Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), chairman 
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "But I am still of the view we 
should not go in. There are no U.S. interests justifying military action." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as some of the most outspoken foes of Clinton's saber-rattling grudgingly 
applauded his decision to send a delegation led by former President Jimmy 
Carter to Haiti, they criticized the timing and the scope of the group's 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it had been done long ago, before we had an invasion force off the 
shore of Haiti," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). "And I would like their 
charter to discuss a wide variety of issues rather than just the circumstances 
of the military's departure." 
</P>
<P>
 Senators and representatives interviewed Saturday generally said that they do 
not expect to get an opportunity to cast a vote opposing military action. 
Rather, they predicted that if an eleventh-hour diplomatic settlement is not 
reached this weekend, Clinton will send in the forces poised just off Haiti's 
shores shortly before a scheduled vote by the House on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentiment on Capitol Hill has run overwhelmingly against an invasion. Hence 
many lawmakers, particularly Democrats who do not relish the prospect of 
opposing their President on a major foreign policy issue, breathed a sigh of 
relief over the decision to send Carter, retired Army Gen. Colin L. Powell and 
Senate Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) to meet with Haiti's military 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the makeup of this high-powered trio would serve Clinton well not 
only during their mission but also -- if they return empty-handed -- back home. 
Nunn and Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the George 
Bush Administration, carry particular clout with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Their credibility is further enhanced by their independence from the President 
who dispatched them: Nunn has been a constant thorn in Clinton's side on 
military issues, and Powell, who served a Republican President, is considered a 
possible opponent of Clinton's in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 As the delegation landed in Haiti, lawmakers said the possibility of averting 
bloodshed is more important than any perception of indecisiveness by a 
President who has been accused of waffling on a host of other foreign policy 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in everyone's interests that the effort be made," said Sen. William S. 
Cohen (R-Me.), a member of the Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said the prospect for success was enhanced last week when Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, the exiled Haitian president, vowed that upon his return his 
government would not seek vengeance against members of the military led by Lt. 
Gen. Raoul Cedras. This, he said, could allow Powell to deliver a powerful 
message to Cedras and his two associates whose departure has been demanded by 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Powell's stature is such that he can make this very clear that it would be an 
unconscionable act for them to inflict on their soldiers, causing these 
soldiers to die for their leadership when they could, instead, live under a 
democratic administration," Cohen said. "Colin Powell is the best person to 
make that appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 If this and other entreaties by the Carter-led emissaries fail, the trio could 
emerge as influential political allies of Clinton. This would depend, however, 
on their message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having three such prestigious figures, including the chairman of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, coming back and saying, 'We have no alternative but 
to carry out this invasion,' would be extremely positive," said a senior 
Democratic congressional aide. "You will then have three very powerful voices 
that will help give Congress a rationale for letting the invasion go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were skeptical. Pell said this development would only modestly decrease 
opposition to Clinton's plans. And Cohen said the narrow scope of the mission 
-- to discuss with the Haitians only their means of departure -- meant the 
Administration could not say, "We tried every alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Two House Democrats who generally support Clinton said they expect to continue 
to oppose an invasion if the diplomatic initiative does not produce a 
breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're unsuccessful, I'm not sure how much it will change," said Rep. 
Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee. 
"The people who are upset about it can't figure out what the national interest 
is, and Carter going there does not define the national interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who chairs a House Foreign Affairs 
subcommittee, said he detests the brutality of the Haitian regime and wants to 
see U.S. foreign assistance and diplomatic policy used to promote democracy 
abroad. But he drew the line at military action. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the life of me," Berman said, "I cannot understand the underlying 
conceptual justification for using U.S. military forces where there's no U.S. 
security interest, there's no fundamental U.S. economic interest and there has 
been no aggression against one country by another." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) was one of a minority of lawmakers who said that 
he would not oppose an invasion if it came to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, he said, Clinton put his credibility on the line by 
vowing to invade unless Cedras and his cronies left Haiti.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; MILITARY IS STILL UNEASY OVER ITS MISSION IN HAITI; 
PENTAGON: A TRUCE BETWEEN CLINTON AND OFFICERS IN THE ARMED FORCES HAS 
DEVELOPED. BUT IT COULD UNRAVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The officer leaned on a railing overlooking a verdant Pentagon courtyard and 
reflected on his commander in chief's latest order to muster the troops for a 
possible invasion of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with President Clinton's Haiti policy, the officer complained, was 
the mixed signals, the flip-flops, the on-again, off-again threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with Clinton's Haiti policy, added a fellow Army officer, is that 
troops alone cannot rebuild a country in which political terror and grinding 
poverty have long prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with Clinton's Haiti policy, chimed in one brush-cut Marine, is 
that it will strain shrinking U.S. forces with yet another commitment at a time 
when money is short and demands are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably gone from the officers' banter, however, was any talk of a young 
Clinton's draft-dodging or pot-smoking. Gone was the stinging resentment of the 
days when Clinton appeared intent on opening the military to out-of-the-closet 
homosexuals. Gone were the jokes about the commander in chief's weak salute or 
his letters to the draft board. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officers, seemingly marching toward an invasion of Haiti at Clinton's 
order, are grappling with disquieting doubts about the mission they may be 
asked to conduct in that impoverished island nation. But the deep disquiet they 
felt toward Clinton almost two years ago has given way to a more businesslike 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, few continue to question the intentions, the integrity or the military 
prerogatives of a commander in chief who never served in the U.S. armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've gotten over that immature thing," one Army officer said. "This 
is not a personal military thing against the President. He's the commander in 
chief, and most of the military has just sort of internalized that. We've got 
our bats and balls and we're ready to play. People have basically made their 
peace with Bill Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 But it may be an uneasy peace. While the raw feelings of Clinton's early days 
in office have eased, the professional misgivings of many military officers 
about the Haiti operation have not. And if an invasion of Haiti draws U.S. 
troops into a protracted commitment or, worse, military disaster, officers 
warned that their newly cordial relations with Clinton could sour. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, could have dramatic political consequences for a commander in 
chief whose foreign and defense policies have failed to win the enthusiastic 
support of either the military or the American people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, ready for a battle that could be defused by a last-minute 
diplomatic maneuver, military officers were willing to fill the void with talk 
about the impending mission and the policies that led to it. Clinton, 
meanwhile, took pains to demonstrate a solid front with the Pentagon's senior 
military officers, traveling to the Pentagon for a final briefing on the 
military's invasion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Striding out of the Pentagon with Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the four chiefs of the nation's service branches in 
tow, Clinton appeared both commanding and attentive to the military officials 
-- a delicate balance for a leader as he prepares to send troops into harm's 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts, pointing to Clinton's lack of military service and his 
controversial first steps in overhauling military policy, predicted that any 
use of force would unleash a torrent of barely concealed complaints from 
military officers. And so far, many retired officers, including Persian Gulf 
War commander Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, have been openly critical of Clinton 
and his invasion plans. By contrast, however, the misgivings of the military's 
active-duty leaders have been largely muted. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Clinton, one of the military's most authoritative figures -- 
retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, a former Joint Chiefs chairman -- so far has 
voiced little public complaint about an invasion that has drawn weak support 
from the American public and vigorous opposition from Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 At Clinton's request, Powell joined former President Jimmy Carter and Sen. Sam 
Nunn (D-Ga.) on a mission Saturday to the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince to 
try to defuse the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 But one senior officer, noting that many officers at the Pentagon harbor 
profound concerns about an invasion of Haiti, warned that the military's stance 
could change. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Haiti invasion turns sour, he said, military officers will be blunt in 
their "I-told-him-so's." 
</P>
<P>
 "The chickens coming home to roost will not just be from the military but from 
the public at large," the senior officer said. "President Clinton will really 
be held accountable if this thing goes south." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers will not need to hold press conferences to air their grievances, 
either. Lawmakers, many of them bitterly opposed both to the invasion and to 
Clinton, will call admirals and generals into open hearings to dissect the 
operation. In those sessions, as well as in future hearings on budgets and 
military missions, the officer said, "direct questions will be met with very 
candid and direct responses." 
</P>
<P>
 Principally, officers cited concerns that they could be drawn into a 
protracted engagement in which foes are indistinguishable from friends and 
where the definition of success -- or of completion -- is not sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are issues about which reasonable men and women will disagree, and 
that's the way this debate is being conducted," said one recently retired 
colonel who maintains close ties to former colleagues. "But because the 
military's means are so limited now, all those apprehensions have been 
magnified." 
</P>
<P>
 Still other officers complained about the constant stream of demands for 
military solutions at a time when their ranks, and their budgets, have thinned. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the relative quiescence of military officers reflects one 
crucial fact: Once a President's order has been given, the military's role is 
to determine how best to accomplish an operation's declared objectives, not to 
question whether they ought to be pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I think it's worth any American lives to intervene in Haiti right now? No. 
There's not a catastrophe down there -- you can't justify it," one Marine 
officer said. "But we're leaning forward right now. People joined the military 
to do stuff like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the proposed Haiti invasion comes at a time when the military 
services are jockeying furiously for roles and resources in an environment of 
shrinking budgets and force consolidations. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Army and Air Force leaders were called before a congressionally 
established commission to plead their case, and in the coming week, the Navy 
and Marine Corps will be called in. 
</P>
<P>
 If it goes forward, the Haiti invasion will give each service ammunition in 
the scramble for resources. "There is a sense among many that, hey, it may be a 
lousy war, but it's the only one we've got at a time when everyone's being 
called upon to justify themselves," the Marine officer said.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; CONTRADICTORY EMOTIONS OVERTAKE MIAMI'S LITTLE HAITI; 
REACTION: MANY FEEL ACTION IS NEEDED. BUT FEAR OF BLOODSHED AND MISTRUST OF 
AMERICAN MOTIVATIONS TEMPER COMMUNITY'S ENTHUSIASM.

<P>
 On what could be the eve of a U.S.-led invasion of their tormented homeland, 
the parishioners of Notre Dame d'Haiti Roman Catholic Church will don their 
Sunday best today and pray for a quick end to any bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause may be a just one, they allow, but the fact remains that once again 
lives may be lost in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 "As in all wars, some innocents will pay for it," said Jean Destine, a social 
worker who took his 11-year-old son to a peace vigil that broke up after 
sunrise Saturday. "But the invasion has to be done. It's the only way." 
</P>
<P>
 As a fearsome armada waits off the coast of Haiti, ready to disgorge its cargo 
of troops and weapons, a sense of expectation -- tinged alternately with hope 
and suspicion -- has overtaken the bustling streets of the Miami neighborhood 
known as Little Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Contradictory emotions abound in this singular community, where news 
broadcasts updating developments resound in English and Creole amid the 
tree-shaded streets of deteriorating pastel cottages, rainbow-hued mom-and-pop 
shops and flimsy apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the invasion," said Erve Paul, a 35-year-old construction worker 
from Cap Haitien who spoke in the Ceci bon bakery. "But I agree with it." 
</P>
<P>
 His comments seemed to encapsulate a rough consensus in Little Haiti, a center 
of the Haitian diaspora, where the many likenesses of exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide attest to his Gandhi-like standing among some. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, particularly Brooklyn, is home to more Haitians, but Florida's 
Haitians are more likely to be recent arrivals closely attuned to the fierce 
politics of their native land. 
</P>
<P>
 Grating on the Haitians here and elsewhere is the reality that it will 
probably be a U.S.-led force -- not Haitians themselves -- that will restore 
Aristide to the presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Many mention the humiliating U.S. military occupation of Haiti earlier in the 
century (1915-34) and Washington's longtime tolerance of the Duvalier tyranny, 
which finally collapsed in 1986 with the flight of Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) 
Duvalier to France. 
</P>
<P>
 Proud of the slave revolt that led to the proclamation of the world's first 
black republic in 1804, Haitians point out that a pro-slavery U.S. government 
denied it diplomatic recognition for more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 "The invasion is a very bitter pill to swallow," said Father Thomas Wenski, 
the Creole-speaking Polish American who serves as pastor of Notre Dame d'Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Most invasion opponents seemed to agree that Aristide must be restored to 
power and that the military regime of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras must be ousted. But 
they favored other means -- continued economic pressure on Haiti, material 
support for pro-democracy groups inside the country, even the arming and 
training of an exile force -- than the Clinton Administration's ambitious 
blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to believe that this invasion is going to solve things," said 
Jean-Claude Exulien, a historian who came to the United States after spending a 
year as a political prisoner during the Duvalier years. "I don't believe in 
miracles myself," added Exulien, who spoke on a field as he coached Haitian 
American youths playing soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others fear that Aristide could be reduced to a figurehead, hemmed in 
by Pentagon officials who they suspect will really run Haiti until a transition 
occurs to a new government more malleable by White House interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder what will happen once some general countermands an Aristide 
directive," Wenski said after presiding over a prayer service in Creole at his 
parish church, a converted school cafeteria. "Where's the principle of 
legitimacy then? Where's the principle of rule of law?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many here are also not optimistic that occupying U.S. authorities will ever 
call on the coup's principal supporters -- the Haitian mixed-race elite, 
largely ensconced behind gated compounds in Petionville, a fashionable 
Port-au-Prince suburb -- to answer for their actions. Among Little Haiti's 
overwhelmingly poor and black population -- many of whom had to endure 
harrowing boat journeys and lengthy immigration detentions -- there is great 
resentment against the power clique back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Clinton to identify Cedras as the one bad boy is so simplistic that it 
almost seems done by design," said Roger E. Biamby, director of the Pierre 
Toussaint Catholic Center in Little Haiti, named after an 18th-Century Haitian 
activist in New York. "The Americans are going to end up protecting the very 
people who are backing Cedras and his thugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Such mistrust runs deep here. Many believe that the CIA had a role in the 
September, 1991, coup that ousted Aristide, a populist priest whose strident 
advocacy on behalf of impoverished masses gained him many enemies in both the 
United States and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all CIA boys," Guy Gerald Victor, a longtime activist here, said 
about Cedras and his cohorts. "The CIA will always find a way to protect them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Victor, who fled Haiti during the brutal reign of Francois (Papa 
Doc) Duvalier, calls the invasion necessary to stem the slaughter that he says 
has cost thousands of lives since the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see no harm in the troops going there to help," said Victor, who predicted 
that the ragtag Haitian forces would run away in the face of advancing U.S. 
troops, despite Cedras' blustering comments to the contrary. "This operation 
won't last more than one day." 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian Refugee Center, the social service group that Victor heads, has 
often harshly criticized Clinton Administration policy -- particularly the 
now-discontinued practice of repatriating Haitians intercepted at sea. (A mural 
outside its Little Haiti headquarters depicts a desperate Haitian in a swamped 
boat chained to the Statue of Liberty and pleading, "Why?") 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, refugee center advocates said, Clinton finally got it right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The systematic killing must be stopped now," Steven Forester, chief attorney 
at the center, said as he handed a visitor a photograph of a recent victim 
whose face had been mutilated. 
</P>
<P>
 "People walk in here all the time with these kinds of cases," Forester said, 
noting that the dead man's mother lives a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, on Northeast 54th Street, the commercial hub of Little Haiti, a mood 
of jubilation prevailed the other night during a storefront rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, we see the lifting of the dark clouds that have covered the horizon 
for so long!" a speaker leading pro-Aristide chants shouted to the exultant 
crowd of more than 200 that spilled onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Anguish about the prospect of civilian casualties, however, tempers such 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a feeling some of my family might die," said Paul, the construction 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Once any invasion starts, residents predicted, Haitians themselves will likely 
target the paramilitary thugs -- known as Tontons Macoutes during the Duvalier 
era but now often called "attaches" -- who enforce the government's reign of 
terror. Many fear a fratricidal bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nowhere in the woods you can hide in Haiti," said Apollon Philias, a 
45-year-old restaurant manager. "Everyone knows everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 An ouster of Haiti's military rulers would also mean an end to a near-total 
U.N. embargo, allowing expatriates to visit relatives and presumably reigniting 
the once-thriving Florida-Haiti commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to be back there," said Samedi Fiorvil, who was locked up for 17 
months as an illegal immigrant when he first arrived in the United States, 
despite an ultimately successful asylum claim based on death threats received 
in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "We accept the invasion now because we don't have any choice," Fiorvil said. 
He plans to return home next month and rejoin his wife and three children -- 
under an Aristide government. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-hit merchants who ply the cross-cultural trade in everything from 
foodstuffs to healing potions to Creole tapes seemed ecstatic that things may 
finally improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the invasion comes true, everyone will be glad," said Louna Phillipp, who 
keeps a combination variety store, market and business office along Northeast 
54th Street, its walls adorned with images of Aristide and assassination 
victims. "There's been too much killing already."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; SCARED RESIDENTS TAKE FLIGHT IN PORT-AU-PRINCE; 
CIVILIANS: ONE WOMAN KILLED IN FRANTIC EFFORTS TO FLEE CAPITAL CITY. PEOPLE 
FEAR VIOLENCE OF INVASION OR RETALIATION BY BACKERS OF RULING HAITIAN ARMY.

<P>
 Terrified by the possibility of a U.S. invasion or retaliation from supporters 
of the ruling army, Haitians flocked to bus stations throughout the capital 
Saturday to flee the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman carrying her year-old daughter dressed in a white Sunday dress was 
sprinting to catch an overcrowded bus that was pulling out. One man jumped onto 
the rear bumper with such force that he broke a tail light when the vehicle 
unexpectedly stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Frantic flight turned to tragedy for one family when a truck lost its brakes 
and careened onto the sidewalk of a bus stop, killing a woman waiting to head 
north to the mountain village of St. Michel de l'Attalaye. 
</P>
<P>
 Her three sons clutched each other's hands and wailed in grief after 
60-year-old Mercianne Metor's body was taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans caused this! The Americans told us to leave," cried Evans 
Metor, 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Genia Mireille-Alexandre, 34, sitting on an overstuffed bag of possessions 
while breastfeeding the youngest of her seven children as she waited for a bus, 
said she has no radio and does not know what specific threat faces her country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a lot of people leave, so I'm leaving too," she said, adding that she 
hoped to stay with relatives in the southwestern city of Les Cayes. 
</P>
<P>
 A 34-year-old pregnant woman sat waiting with her husband and three children, 
her tattered dress bunched up around her thighs. "I'm afraid my children will 
get hurt," explained Mem Andre, also bound for Les Cayes. 
</P>
<P>
 Noel, 29, a typist and driver, stood for hours in the crowded parking area of 
an abandoned Shell station used as the bus station for the town of St. Marc. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried everything" to catch a bus north, said Noel, who wants to return 
to his village in the Artibonite Valley. With security agents around, he did 
not want to elaborate on his reasons for leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 But many in the crowd were young men like him who would be particularly at 
risk if military-backed gunmen came through poor neighborhoods seeking 
suspected supporters of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hundreds of residents of the Dominican border town of Dajabon are 
leaving or preparing to flee out of fear that a U.S. invasion of Haiti will 
trigger a refugee stampede. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're leaving because we have children and we don't want anything to happen 
to them," Carmen Pena said as she prepared to depart. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses and trucks leaving town in the last few days have been crammed with 
women toting bags and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension has mounted along the 240-mile Haitian-Dominican border, which divides 
the island of Hispaniola, since President Clinton's warning Thursday that U.S. 
forces will invade if Haiti's military leaders did not step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Dajabon, a town of a few thousand people 190 miles northwest of 
the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo, fear that Haitians could rush the 
border. Others worry about bombing and shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Military commanders said Saturday that there has been a slight swelling of the 
population of Ouanaminthe, a tiny Haitian town a mile across the border. 
</P>
<P>
 One Dominican military commander said Saturday that his soldiers will not 
allow Haitians to cross the border.

RWANDA GOVERNMENT STRUGGLES TO GAIN CASH, CREDIBILITY; AFRICA: THE COUNTRY IS 
BANKRUPT, ITS EXPORT CROPS DESTROYED. BUT AID FLOWS ONLY TO PRIVATE GROUPS AS 
WORLD WEIGHS WHETHER NEW LEADERS CAN BE TRUSTED. 
</P>

<P>
 For the past two months, civil servants have gone unpaid and have lived off 
aid parcels from the World Food Program. The government's coffers are empty. At 
the moment, it can afford one ambassador abroad, an envoy at the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the shabby building where the prime minister has installed his office, the 
telephones don't work, there's no electricity and the water doesn't run. Jagged 
shards of broken glass litter the stairs, and in the main suite on the second 
floor, patches of carpet have been ripped from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working in this ruin," Prime Minister Faustin Twagirimungu exclaimed 
one morning last week to visitors, throwing up his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Africa's newest government is one whose employees nowadays must hitch rides 
with foreign correspondents to conduct state business. Does any other regime 
face vaster challenges or problems? 
</P>
<P>
 Maimed by civil war and massacres, Rwanda has lost between a half-million and 
1 million people, the United Nations estimates. About 2 million other Rwandans 
fled into exile and are trickling back only slowly. Throughout the country, 
there are something like 85,000 orphans and abandoned children. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty thousand land mines, sinister leftovers from the civil war, dot the 
gorgeous, rolling landscape; U.N. peacekeepers say only heavily traveled roads 
should be considered mine-free. Most of Rwanda's 1,600 primary schools were 
pillaged during or after the fighting, and some were booby-trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 War and the fastest exodus of refugees in modern times have wiped out this 
year's coffee and tea crops, this poor landlocked African country's largest 
earners of foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is gloomy," Twagirimungu summed up. "No matter what happens 
here, we need foreign assistance in all domains." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Rwanda's new leaders complain, rich Western countries -- including the 
United States -- are hanging back and scrutinizing Rwandan officials' actions 
to see if they prove to be as bloodthirsty as the people they ousted from 
power. For the past two months, they say, they have received no foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major disappointment," said Maj. Wilson Rutayisire, a government 
spokesman. The Rwandans say they can't even get their hands on the $200 million 
in assistance pledged by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a condition," Twagirimungu pointed out, "that Rwanda must pay 
arrears that amount to $6.5 million. Where do we get the $6.5 million to pay 
the arrears?" 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, employees of the United Nations and foreign relief agencies zip 
through Kigali's streets in fleets of white Toyotas and other spanking-new 
cars. Working in offices powered by diesel-fueled generators, these expatriates 
can communicate more easily via satellite telephone and fax with their home 
offices in Geneva or New York than Twagirimungu's subordinates can phone across 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 An entire alphabet soup's worth of U.N. agencies and foreign charities has 
arrived on military transports and special charters to deal with the emergency 
needs of Rwandans, especially those who fled their homes. When a cholera 
epidemic broke out in the squalid refugee camps across the border, in the 
Zairian town of Goma, some of those organizations rushed to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Now about to begin its third month in power, Twagirimungu's government of 
"national unity" is struggling to piece together a shattered economy and 
society, feeling the outside world is largely indifferent, if not suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Twagirimungu and the rest of Rwanda's leaders are now in power because the 
rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front's army routed the old government in a 3 1/2-month 
war that ended in July. "Civil war, not negotiation, decided the issue," is the 
laconic summary one official of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Rwanda scrawled 
on a lecture pad in the briefing room at the U.N. peacekeepers' headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Proclaiming magnanimity in victory, the RPF implemented a power-sharing plan 
that had been agreed to by the rebels and the late President Juvenal 
Habyarimana in the northern Tanzanian city of Arusha on Aug. 3, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A Council of Ministers was formed of people from five parties as well as two 
independents. Twagirimungu, 49, a member of the Hutu ethnic majority who was a 
Canadian-trained university teacher and once ran a trucking company in the 
western city of Cyangugu, became its head. He is not from the RPF but leads 
another party, the Democratic Republican Movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, though, the RPF created a powerful executive not mentioned in 
the Arusha accord and awarded itself the presidency and vice presidency. Among 
the ministerial portfolios, it grabbed most of the heavyweights: defense, 
public service, interior, health, transport and telecommunications, 
rehabilitation, women's affairs, youth and sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have really turned around the concept of power sharing," one openly 
skeptical diplomat here said. In Rwanda, anyone who carries a gun as part of 
his government job, in the army or police, now appears to be under the control 
of the RPF. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one of the reasons for the continued hesitation by many countries, 
including the United States, to provide badly needed support to Rwanda's 
fledgling government at the same time they are lavishly doling out aid funds to 
help feed, resettle, educate and heal ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reservation appears to be that unless the government does much more 
to reassure the Hutus, the vast majority of refugees will stay in the foul 
camps in Zaire and Tanzania, and stability will not return to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Clinton Administration, at least two conditions must be met before 
Rwanda's government is deemed to merit large-scale assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 As stipulated at Arusha, the RPF's army must integrate officers and soldiers 
from the now-exiled force that it defeated, and a new National Assembly to be 
formed must include representatives of the former ruling party, Habyarimana's 
National Revolutionary Movement for Development, commonly known as MRND in its 
French-language initials. 
</P>
<P>
 Such pressure has been persistent, if discreet. "I've never seem a written 
document," Twagirimungu said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and other Rwandan officials don't hide their outrage at demands that 
they adhere to an agreement that predates the war, as well as the massacres 
last April and May masterminded by officials of the former government and the 
MRND's youth wing, the Interahamwe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to negotiate with killers," the prime minister said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of foreign demands that his government become more "broad-based," 
Twagirimungu said he tried to enlist some "innocent people" from the old ruling 
party, including a former defense minister and the former ambassadors to Uganda 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 But they refused, he said. "If people don't really want to serve their 
country, we can't fight, but there are millions of other Rwandans who could 
serve better," Twagirimungu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lines of authority are still being demarcated inside Rwanda's new leadership. 
But at home as well as abroad, many people are carefully watching what sort of 
role Paul Kagame, 37, the soft-voiced vice president and defense minister, will 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-foot-3, painfully thin member of the Tutsi minority that was targeted in 
last spring's genocide, Kagame now roars through the capital in a Mercedes jeep 
painted camouflage green, accompanied by a military escort worthy of a head of 
state. Many believe the former guerrilla commander, who led the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front army to victory, is the real power behind the throne. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the great number of Tutsi fighters in Kagame's force and in the 
RPF, further questions are being raised abroad about whether Hutus -- 85% of 
Rwanda's population before the massacres and mass flight -- are equitably 
represented in the country's new order. Before the bloodletting, in which they 
were massively the victims, Tutsis made up only 15% of Rwanda's population. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Tutsi-dominated government' -- I frankly hate this expression," 
Twagirimungu said. "This is a Rwandan government." Most of his ministers, he 
said, are Hutu. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Africa, the leader of the army has often determined who really rules. 
Tacitly recognizing this, the Arusha pact called for the RPF and the old 
government to evenly split the officer corps but for the rebels to supply only 
40% of the troops and the government the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, nothing close to an amalgamation of the old rival forces is taking 
place, although scattered officers and men of the defeated Rwandan government 
forces have joined the RPF's army. And the victors seem in no hurry to 
demobilize. 
</P>
<P>
 On Kigali's Revolution Street, the young men in natty berets and mismatched 
uniforms from the Rwandan Patriotic Front army stand guard round the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Rutayisire, the government spokesman, said there was a plan to get 
"children" out of the army and everybody else into barracks but that its 
implementation would depend on "the security situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rwanda's broke government is trying to cope. Many government 
employees have rallied to its support, Twagirimungu said. But since the new 
regime has been in power, there has been no money to pay them. Before they 
fled, the country's former rulers cleaned out the vaults of the Rwandan 
National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Now "people don't get their salaries -- they can't even get soap to wash 
themselves," Twagirimungu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Private banks were likewise looted and remain closed. Hoarding their Rwandan 
francs to pay for essentials -- many of which, from rice to gasoline, have 
doubled in price since April -- people are waiting for Twagirimungu's 
government to issue a new currency. He declined to say when that will happen.

NEW TECHNOLOGY BRINGING GOVERNMENT, PEOPLE CLOSER; INFORMATION: SOME OF THE 
PROJECTS ARE AIMED AT RESTORING FAITH IN THE AGENCIES -- AND THEY'VE TURNED OUT 
WELL. BUT OTHERS ARE COSTLY FAILURES.

 It was shaping up to be a typical summer afternoon for Tom Tate, sitting at 
his computer at the Department of Agriculture, until the message showed up in 
his electronic mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help. I live in Des Moines, Iowa," Tate recalls it said. "The water from the 
floods is starting to spill over and pollute our water supply. What can we do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tate remembered that the government had produced flyers on water purification 
a year before for victims of Hurricane Andrew. He retrieved the text from the 
department's computer memory and transmitted it across the Internet network. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, another message arrived: "You made me a local hero." Tate's 
correspondent, it turns out, was no local bureaucrat in need of federal 
assistance. He was a teen-ager with a paper route and a home computer. With the 
aid of other carriers, he had taken Tate's flyers, printed up copies, slipped 
them into that day's newspapers and helped thousands of Iowans purify their tap 
water. Tate never even learned the boy's name. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode is only one of many examples that hint at another promising new 
application of technology: making the ocean of information generated by local, 
state and federal governments more accessible to citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Against a backdrop of dissatisfaction with public institutions perceived as 
gridlocked and disconnected, technology is emerging as a focal point in efforts 
to restore the public's damaged faith in government. After all the rhetoric is 
stripped away, technology is at the center of the Clinton Administration's 
"reinventing government" campaign and is the cornerstone of many current state 
and local reform projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Louisiana, the government is experimenting with video telephones that let 
residents of rural communities be seen by doctors in the city. Patients in one 
place can stick their tongue out and say "ahh" while a physician peers down 
their throat from miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 * In South Carolina, among other states, officials are developing electronic 
"parent locater" databases to help authorities track down parents who fail to 
pay child support. The networks integrate an array of personal records compiled 
from different states. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Hawaii, citizens can use their home computers to obtain information about 
state jobs and college scholarships, to access university and public libraries, 
and to retrieve texts of pending state legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The federal government has launched a computer service called FedWorld that 
enables citizens to access information from more than 130 government databases 
by dialing a single phone number. The Government Printing Office generates 
15,000 new titles a year; after only 18 months, FedWorld has an inventory of 
2.5 million documents and logs some 3,000 calls a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Government's rush to embrace high technology is not without peril. Some 
projects may prove ill-conceived or prohibitively expensive. California's 
effort to digitize its Department of Motor Vehicles records, for example, has 
expanded from a five-year, $27-million project to a $44-million mess with no 
clear end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, opening up government databases to any citizen with a home 
computer and a modem raises difficult questions about potential violations of 
privacy. And even the most avid proponents of unfettered access acknowledge 
that offering up gigabytes of government data accomplishes little if it is 
presented in a way that most people find unintelligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have this idea that if everybody had all the information, then we 
would be a democratic society," said Prof. Amitai Etzioni of George Washington 
University. "But the really intriguing question is, what do people do with that 
information?" 
</P>
<P>
 What is missing, Etzioni says, is some kind of "democratic finger," a digital 
device that points the way to important information. Otherwise, he said, 
on-line government may produce little more than widespread confusion and wasted 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, much of the creative energy in government today is being directed 
at finding ways to use computers to streamline, modernize and humanize the 
government institutions many citizens seem to resent. 
</P>
<P>
 The convergence of government and technology has received a big boost from 
Vice President Al Gore, a dedicated Internet user who headed the 
Administration's "reinventing government" task force. Many of that group's 
recommendations for making the federal government more efficient involve new 
applications of technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement has also benefited from the arrival of a generation of younger, 
technology-friendly policy activists who accompanied Clinton and Gore to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 When the National Governors' Assn. recently surveyed state-level experiments 
with technology, it discovered a few favored strategies: 
</P>
<P>
 KIOSKS: Resembling automated teller machines used by bank customers, 
government kiosks are popping up in shopping malls and grocery stores in 
several states. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, experts predict, citizens will conduct much of their routine 
business with government at these kiosks, renewing auto registrations, 
obtaining benefits and acquiring information about state services without ever 
confronting a bureaucrat. The objective is to bring government to the places 
where people generally congregate, rather than making them stand in line at a 
handful of government office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 California is among the first states to experiment with kiosks. At more than a 
dozen sites around the state, people can get copies of their birth certificate, 
register their car and review job openings listed by the Employment Development 
Department. An even bigger trial, involving roughly 50 kiosks, is under way in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vermont, citizens use kiosk terminals to learn about 2,400 health, 
education and social services, and to obtain information about state colleges 
and training schools. In New Jersey, kiosks dispense information about day-care 
providers. Colorado's kiosks answer queries about child care, legal issues, 
business data and recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 CARDS: Government-issued cards resembling credit cards enable citizens to 
obtain state services more efficiently and to cut down on fraud and abuse. Some 
cards store information about the holder in a magnetic stripe, while others are 
"smart cards" equipped with tiny computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arkansas, Medicaid recipients present doctors and pharmacists with cards 
that contain information about their medical status and eligibility for 
benefits. By June, the state expects to have saved $7.6 million on an initial 
investment of $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming is developing a system in which people eligible for the Special 
Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children will receive cards 
containing a silicon chip that contains the bearer's full benefit record. Each 
time the card is used to obtain food or health products from designated 
retailers, the information stored in the chip is automatically adjusted to 
reflect the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Other states, including Alabama, Idaho, Maryland, New Jersey and South 
Carolina, are developing their own magnetic and smart cards to deliver 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER EFFORTS: California is developing a statewide environmental resource 
inventory to be used in planning roads and developments. It is trying to 
exploit technology to reduce redundant tax reporting requirements and is 
developing a statewide parent locater to improve collection of child-support 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Some projects are tailored to particular regional needs. North Dakota and the 
U.S. Agriculture Department have linked 37 weather monitoring stations into a 
central computer system available to any computer user with a modem. The system 
allows farmers and ranchers to obtain detailed local weather forecasts as 
quickly as they are issued. 
</P>
<P>
 About a quarter of the states, including California, are developing computer 
systems to help people pay their taxes. Some simply dispense tax forms 
electronically, while others allow taxpayers to file their returns and transfer 
funds by computer. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar full-service system is being launched this year by the federal 
government. In the past, taxpayers were required to make electronic filings 
through an intermediary, such as a tax preparer, but now they can handle the 
chore themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The new FedWorld database, which was inaugurated during the George Bush 
Administration, allows anyone with a computer to access the combined files of 
all federal libraries. Available records include all presidential speeches, 
pronouncements and press releases. But so far, most users confine themselves to 
the Office of Personnel Management's job opportunities bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
 With government agencies going on-line at an increasing rate, politicians are 
not far behind. In California, gubernatorial candidates Pete Wilson and 
Kathleen Brown have made all of their speeches and press releases available to 
computer users so, as Brown puts it, "people don't have to use snail mail." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress is also experimenting with making itself more accessible. This month, 
it began posting the text of all House bills on the Internet, along with the 
official schedule of House action. A year ago, seven House members obtained 
individual electronic mailboxes on the Internet so constituents could contact 
them instantaneously. Only 14 months later, 36 House members are on line, and 
the number increases by two or three lawmakers each week. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the more tradition-bound Senate has not created its own electronic 
gateway. 
</P>
<P>
 But the digital stampede has not been trouble-free. Internet-connected House 
members, for instance, are not willing to answer citizen queries 
electronically. Responses are sent by conventional mail, as they were 200 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, is that anyone could "spoof" an e-mail messager by impersonating 
a member of Congress. That glitch won't be solved until "digital signatures" 
are created to authenticate the true author of a computer message. 
</P>
<P>
 Another danger posed by government's initial forays into technology involve 
the potential waste of taxpayer dollars. That is one reason that New York set 
up a Center for Technology in Government at the State University at Albany. Its 
mandate is to build prototype systems to be tested in university settings. Once 
perfected, they will be used to create a full-blown statewide system. 
</P>
<P>
 California already has made a few costly mistakes. Its plan to computerize the 
state's 38 DMV databases went awry, according to Government Technology 
magazine, because the state was trying to develop new technology and lacked a 
clear business plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's kiosk program, Info/California, was supposed to have 104 machines 
in operation by now, so far only 15 are up and running. (The only one in Los 
Angeles is at the Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw Plaza Business Revitalization Offices, 
3650 Martin Luther King Blvd. Suite 246). Texas, which copied California's 
kiosk plan, jumped ahead by renting rather than buying its machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Some users find the anonymity of technology appealing, as Info/California 
project manager Harold Ferber learned when he approached a tattooed biker 
dressed in leather and chains who was looking for a job at a kiosk in San 
Diego. Ferber said the biker told him he preferred using the machine because 
when he showed up at state employment offices, the staff discriminated against 
him because of his looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most interesting experiments have been ad hoc. 
</P>
<P>
 In the White House Office of Media Affairs, aide Jock Gill has been assigned 
to think about new technology. While attending a conference, he met Tate, the 
Agriculture Department official, and the two began discussing the possibility 
of creating an on-line network composed of representatives of any branch of 
government interested in pooling information. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first organizational meeting included representatives of three agencies: 
Agriculture, Commerce and Education, so they called their embryonic network 
ACE. Later, they gave the acronym an official name, Americans Communicating 
Electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of government information laying around in people's brown 
folders or in file cabinets that would be of great interest to citizen 
taxpayers," Tate said. "But there are lots of barriers and constraints to 
getting it out." 
</P>
<P>
 The ACE group now has 350 affiliate locations across the country. Monthly 
meetings are open to bureaucrats and citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Iowa paper carrier who messaged Tate about the rising floodwaters 
located him through the ACE computer group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of a guerrilla effort," Tate said. "Not really much like government 
at all." An Internet Phone Book 
</P>
<P>
 With a computer and a modem, you can message the White House -- and many other 
government entities -- in a matter of seconds. The Internet, a giant web of 
computer networks that makes this all possible, can be accessed through 
commerical on-line services. Some of the officials and agencies that can be 
reached: 
</P>
<P>
 THE WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
<P>
 The options: Citizens can send President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore 
electronic messages over the Internet, as well as retrieve White House 
documents such as speeches, executive orders and press releases. (So far, First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has not gone on-line.) 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's Internet address: President@WhiteHouse.Gov 
</P>
<P>
 Gore's Internet address: VicePresident@WhiteHouse.Gov 
</P>
<P>
 To obtain White House publications: Publications@WhiteHouse.Gov 
</P>
<P>
 For information about available documents: FAQ@WhiteHouse.Gov 
</P>
<P>
 Replies: Because it is easy to impersonate other people on-line, Clinton and 
Gore answer their e-mail by conventional mail, and the delay can be 
considerable. All electronic messages to the leaders are downloaded onto 
magnetic disks by the Secret Service and screened. Federal authorities have 
made at least one arrest based on a digital threat to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
</P>
<P>
 The options: A growing number of House members (but no senators) can be 
messaged over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Menu of individual addresses: Congress@HR.House.Gov. (It takes about 10 
minutes to get a menu.) 
</P>
<P>
 Replies: Sent by conventional mail. Only about 40 lawmakers are on-line so 
far, but more are joining each week. 
</P>
<P>
 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
</P>
<P>
 The options: Computer users can access more than 130 federal databases, 
including most government libraries in Washington, through a service called 
FedWorld. The network can be entered through the Internet or with a direct 
telephone connection using a modem and telecommunications software. 
</P>
<P>
 FedWorld's Internet address: FedWorld.Gov 
</P>
<P>
 The direct line: (703) 321-8020 
</P>
<P>
 For assistance, call the FedWorld help line: (703) 487-4608 
</P>
<P>
 AMERICANS COMMUNICATING ELECTRONICALLY (ACE) 
</P>
<P>
 The options: ACE is a group of federal bureaucrats who are trying to use 
technology to make the government more accessible. The ACE bulletin board is 
open to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 ACE's Internet address: ACE-MG@ESUSDA.Gov

CONGRESS HOOKED ON TOBACCO LOBBY CASH, GROUP CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tobacco interests have spent more than $7 million since 1987 targeting key 
lawmakers to defeat attempts to ban smoking in public places and raise tobacco 
taxes, a consumer group said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress won't raise the tobacco tax or clean up our indoor air as long as it 
remains hooked on 'Camel Cash,' which may be just as hazardous to our health as 
cigarettes," said Ed Mierzwinski of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group in 
a statement Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five members of the House leadership, the Ways and Means Committee and 
the Energy and Commerce Committee were among 44 House members receiving more 
than $25,000 each from tobacco PACs from January, 1987, to July 31, 1994, said 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Ways and Means Committee members who voted against a $1.25-per-pack hike in 
the cigarette tax received an average of $18,842. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Thomas Bliley (R-Va.) was the biggest single recipient of tobacco PAC 
contributions, $96,040 since 1987, the group said.

THOUSANDS PROTEST DISNEY HISTORY THEME PARK PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of people opposing a theme park to be built near the historic 
battlegrounds of Virginia marched on Washington on Saturday to raise national 
awareness of their fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Close to 3,000 opponents, including activist Ralph Nader, came from as far 
away as Florida, California and New York and as close as various counties in 
Virginia to have their say about Disney's America. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's America is the Walt Disney Co.'s plan for a 400-acre theme park 
re-creating American history it hopes to establish near the National 
Battlefield Park in Manassas, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Chanting "Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho, Disney's got to go," those opposing the plan 
marched from the Washington Monument to the Capitol, stopping briefly in front 
of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Nader, a consumer advocate and founder of the nonprofit watchdog organization 
Public Citizen, encouraged the opponents to keep up their fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Nader stressed Disney's "philosophy of becoming its own private government," 
and cited the Reedy Creek district Disney created in Orlando, Fla., around Walt 
Disney World, which has its own tax-assessing powers and private police force. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not stopped, Disney will be a model for other corporations," Nader 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting their own spin on the disdain, representatives from many other 
organizations were out in force as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Gallop-Johnson, founder of the Black History Action Coalition, said 
Disney has been secretive in its plan to portray slaves in its theme park. Her 
group is skeptical, she said, about Disney's plans to "make you feel what it 
was like to be a slave." 
</P>
<P>
 "No one will ever know the feelings -- the absolute agony and despair of these 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Local opponent Annie Snyder, chairwoman of the Save the Battlefield Coalition, 
said: "We hope to make (Disney Chairman Michael D.) Eisner change his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 She fears Disney's America will create urban sprawl and cause gridlock on 
roads through the battlefield.

CUBA TO LET FARMERS SELL PRODUCE IN MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sharp break with past policy, the Cuban government will soon allow 
farmers to sell produce in markets where supply and demand will determine 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy was announced in an interview published in Saturday's Granma 
newspaper with Cuba's number two-leader, Gen. Raul Castro, brother of President 
Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Castro said Cuba's 60,000 small private farms, state farms and 
cooperatives will be free to sell produce at the new markets after they fulfill 
their commitments to the state purchasing agency.

EXTRA DAY IN ORBIT BRINGS SCIENCE BONUS; SPACE: ASTRONAUTS CONSERVE SUFFICIENT 
ELECTRICITY TO POWER ADDED LASER LIGHT ATMOSPHERIC EXPERIMENTS. THEY ARE TO 
RETURN TO EARTH MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The space shuttle Discovery showered Earth with lightning-quick pulses of 
green laser light Saturday, a day of bonus science for the astronauts and 
researchers on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 It was much quieter and more subdued than Friday, when two of the crew took 
turns using a jet pack for the first untethered spacewalks in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bit disorienting," spacewalker Carl Meade told a radio 
interviewer Saturday. "But other than that . . . it felt quite normal outside." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you, it was absolutely phenomenal," said astronaut Jerry Linenger, who 
directed the spacewalkers from inside the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission originally was supposed to end today after nine days, but the 
astronauts conserved enough electricity to allow for a 10th day for science 
work. Landing was rescheduled from today to 11:24 a.m. PDT Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Saturday, ground controllers had fired more than 1 million laser pulses 
from Discovery for a study of the atmosphere. Researchers were elated, 
especially those who had lost data because of earlier equipment failures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making up for it, getting as much as we ever hoped for and more," said 
laser experimenter Bob Menzies, an atmospheric scientist at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The six astronauts could see the pencil-thin, fluorescent green pulses 
streaming from Discovery at a rate of 10 per second. 
</P>
<P>
 But they couldn't see the laser light reflecting off the tops of clouds or 
Earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were no reports of anyone on the ground seeing the laser pulses, 
NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
 An instrument aboard Discovery collected the reflected laser light, allowing 
Menzies and other scientists to calculate the altitude and density of desert 
dust and other pollutants in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 They will use the findings to better understand global weather; one of 
Saturday's laser targets was Typhoon Melissa in the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first time the $25-million laser package has flown in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration gave up trying to fix a 
laser-data recorder aboard Discovery, which never worked right from the start. 
The recorder was needed to save any laser measurements that could not be 
transmitted instantly to ground controllers; that turned out to be a small 
portion of the data. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers studying the exhaust from the shuttle's steering jets also had to 
contend with a data-relay problem, which popped up again Saturday. Astronauts 
worked around the problem and fired the jets at instruments carried by an 
82-foot-long beam extended from the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA wants to know how engine exhaust affects solar panels and other 
structures in space before sending Atlantis to dock with Russia's Mir space 
station in May.

 A World War II veteran on a White House tour was taken away by ambulance after 
he fell ill Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident capped a bizarre week at the White House that included a plane 
crashing into the building early Monday morning and six firetrucks racing over 
Friday out of fear a fire had erupted when a light fixture shorted out.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire gutted the historic apartment house where Margaret Mitchell wrote most 
of "Gone With The Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters brought the blaze under control in about 90 minutes early 
Saturday. The cause of the fire was not immediately determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell lived in a first-floor apartment with her husband from 1926 to 1932. 
She referred to the house as "the dump." 
</P>
<P>
 The 95-year-old building, on the city's list of protected landmarks, had been 
slated for demolition before preservation work rescued it in the late 1980s. A 
$2.6-million restoration project was planned.

VOLUNTEERS CLEAR TONS OF TRASH FROM STATE'S BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Volunteers showed up at their local beaches from the borders of Mexico to 
Oregon on Saturday morning wearing gloves, sturdy shoes and sun block to clean 
up the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual cleanup, which began nine years ago to beautify beaches and protect 
marine mammals, fish and birds from dangerous debris, took place along more 
than 700 waterways, wetlands and shorelines, California Coastal Commission 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of trash that isn't going to be there tomorrow. It's a chance 
for volunteers to make a statement about how much we care for the coastline in 
California," said state coordinator Jack Liebster. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 Southern California volunteers found about 60,000 pounds of 
garbage. Their bounty included a dismantled Volkswagen Beetle, a dead boar off 
Catalina Island, four shopping carts and X-rated books, said Marilyn Kronmal, 
the Los Angeles County coordinator. In the county, about a quarter of all 
pollution entering Santa Monica Bay is urban runoff, including trash, motor 
oil, grease, heavy metals, detergent and pet wastes. The runoff is washed into 
storm drain channels and is carried into the bay untreated, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's volunteer force was larger than last year's, when 3,969 people 
collected 43,076 pounds of trash and 4,795 pounds of recyclable material. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most intriguing discoveries were a sofa and a bed found hidden in 
the brush along the shoulders of Newport Back Bay, auto parts dug out of the 
sand along the surf line at Huntington State Beach and the soggy wallet of a 
Laguna Beach maintenance worker that was plucked from the ocean bottom by a 
scuba diver scavenging off Laguna's Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Among odd items picked up in Northern California were a white wedding dress, 
live ammunition, an uncashed check written in 1986 for $1,852.17, a full bottle 
of Prozac, a gun and a microwave, Liebster said.

MAN AT DMV SHOT IN FIGHT OVER WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was shot and seriously injured Saturday inside a Department of Motor 
Vehicles office near Pasadena, apparently during an argument over his 
girlfriend, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred at 11:30 a.m. as the victim was standing in line at the 
DMV building at 49 Rosemead Blvd., in an unincorporated area outside the 
Pasadena city limits, said Deputy Benita Hinojos of the sheriff's Information 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornelius Nicholson, 22, of Long Beach had been waiting in line with his 
girlfriend but decided to leave the building to smoke a cigarette, Hinojos 
said. When he returned, Nicholson became angry with a man who had struck up a 
conversation with the woman, and the two men began arguing, according to 
witnesses. The second man drew a semiautomatic pistol from his pocket and shot 
Nicholson once in the upper body, Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just happened to take place inside a DMV office," Hinojos said. "It 
could have been a Denny's or a Wal-Mart or anywhere else. It appears to (have 
occurred) because he was talking to her." 
</P>
<P>
 As Nicholson collapsed on the floor, the gunman ran out the back door of the 
DMV office and heading toward Colorado Boulevard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies have not identified the man, but said he is a male black, 
about 20 years old, 5 feet, 9 inches tall and weighing 170 pounds. He was 
wearing blue pants, a blue and white striped shirt and black boots, Hinojos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson was taken to a local hospital, where he was upgraded to fair 
condition after surgery.

'GRASS-ROOTS GRANDMA' TURNS HER ATTENTION TO ASSOCIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems to Willowdean Vance that she has been fighting for a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, she lobbied then-U. S. Sen. Lyndon Johnson for better 
housing and schools for military dependents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never forgot about me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Vance shifted her attention to a national drive for freedom of choice 
in health care. "I was good at that too." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, this self-styled "grass-roots grandma" has established herself as one 
of the state's biggest "pains in the butt" to homeowners associations and those 
who support them. 
</P>
<P>
 Vance herself is a member of the Lake Forest Homeowners Assn. No. 1. Her 
cluttered desk is a virtual clearinghouse for cases challenging the authority 
of associations from Orange County to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 She has formed her own watchdog group, the American Homeowners Assn., which 
spits out examples of "injustices" to anyone who will listen. She has compiled 
a book titled "How to Survive a Homeowners Association." 
</P>
<P>
 When problems arise in these neighborhood governments, troubled residents seek 
her out. Should the cases wind up in court, Vance goes with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get at least four or five calls a day here," she said recently. "I don't 
know how they find me, but they do. One person called all the way from 
Delaware. He said he got my number from somebody in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 As was apparently the case with LBJ, most find it hard to forget Vance once 
they've crossed her path, for better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice is roughly the female equivalent of Ross Perot's, and her message is 
delivered with the same machine-gun speed and occasional wit. And she makes no 
bones about whose side she's on. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people buy into homeowner associations," Vance said, "they think they've 
found their dream house. Sure, they have the parks, swimming pools, and 
clubhouses, but more rules than the military. They find out later it's really a 
house of horrors." 
</P>
<P>
 Vance said her campaign for association reform is rooted in her own 
experience. When she moved to her Lake Forest community in 1987, she 
immediately disliked the fact that she needed to show proof of residency each 
time she wanted to use the association clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 When fire crept dangerously close to her home shortly after she moved in, she 
said firefighters had a difficult time attacking the blaze because of the 
narrow streets. When she complained, she said, her neighbors treated her 
rudely. 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems have arisen over issues involving the removal of dying trees 
and the widening of clubhouse doors to accommodate the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I moved here, I liked the idea of the extra security and maintenance," 
she said. "It sounded like a carefree life. Well, my carefree life has given me 
a migraine headache." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Vance and a handful of others, such as Elizabeth J. McMahon, who 
heads the American Homeowners Resource Center, have anointed themselves as 
homeowner watchdogs. 
</P>
<P>
 They rail against attorneys hired by associations to do battle in homeowner 
squabbles. By fax and mail, Vance even instructs homeowners about how they can 
remove board members from neighborhood associations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest Assn. Treasurer Hudson Fields described Vance's activities as 
"nonstop." He said Vance has been "helpful in providing advice in several 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
 "She seems to be very dedicated," he said. "I can't endorse her or knock her 
because I really don't know a whole lot more about her." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Vance's targets are government officials who, she says, are not doing 
enough to monitor association activities. California Assemblyman Dan Hauser 
(D-Arcata), chairman of the Committee on Housing and Community Development, is 
one who feels Vance's wrath regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she serves a purpose," Hauser said. "At least she tries to stir 
things up, and that's good. Sometimes, though, I wish she would get her facts 
straight before she jumps off on things. She is aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm not on her good list, but she's not in my district, either."

NATIONS UNIFIED IN CELEBRATING INDEPENDENCE; FESTIVITIES SPOTLIGHT CULTURES OF 
CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND THEIR AMERICAN EMIGRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Independence Day speeches in five Central American countries on Sept. 15 
always touch on a desire for the republics to someday reunite. 
</P>
<P>
 That dream has found its way to Los Angeles, where the peoples of Costa Rica, 
El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua will unite for a grand 
independence celebration today that starts at 11 a.m. with a parade through 
Pico-Union and continues with festivities at the Normandie Playground. 
</P>
<P>
 The local celebration will include the national anthems of the United States, 
Mexico, the five Central American countries and those of Panama and Belize as 
well, although those two Central American nations celebrate their independence 
separately.  
</P>
<P>
 Dancers representing different regions within all seven Central American 
nations will perform and music will blare throughout the park. And the most 
essential element of any Latin American celebration -- the food -- will be 
plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the masters of food," said Luis Max Ocon, a member of the nonprofit 
Committee for the Central American Independence Parade, which operates at the 
Central American Resource Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has sponsored united independence celebrations eight of the last 
nine years at MacArthur Park, but this year lost the race to reserve that 
locale to KKHJ-AM 930 Radio Alegria, which is having a Mexican Independence Day 
celebration there today. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's parade starts at 7th and Alvarado streets, goes south to Pico 
Boulevard, west to Normandie Avenue passing Santo Tomas Catholic Church, and 
south on Normandie Avenue where it will end at Venice Boulevard at the 
Normandie Playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvaro Torres, a popular singer from El Salvador, was scheduled to be grand 
marshal and to perform but could not attend due to a death in the family, Ocon 
said. Instead, Martha Luz Gutierrez, who was named queen in a Central American 
pageant this month, will serve as grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Managua, Nicaragua, which 52-year-old Ocon left when he was 15, 
families would walk to the Esplanada, the town courtyard, to see a parade of 
townspeople, marching bands, the military and its tanks and listen to political 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We celebrate it like our Fourth of July," he said. "The speakers would talk 
about remembering the people who got involved in the independence and the 
heroes of the country. (They would talk) about the peoples of the five 
republics getting united and that one day we will be united." 
</P>
<P>
 After the five colonies declared their independence from Spain on Sept. 15, 
1821, they formed the Central American Federation, which held from 1823 to 
1838. After its collapse 15 years later the regions became independent nations. 
</P>
<P>
 (Other nations celebrating their independence days through Hispanic Heritage 
Month, Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, are Chile, Cuba, Bolivia and Mexico.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, who is also from Managua, looks forward to today's celebration to 
show off her Nicaraguan culture. "Even though the other Latin cultures are 
similar, we ( Nicaraguans) have our own culture and our own lifestyle," said 
the 21-year-old Cypress College psychology student who was awarded $6,000 in 
scholarships as the pageant's winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Americans who are feeling a touch of nostalgia will be able to meet 
fellow countrymen and taste their traditional foods, like nacatamal, a special 
tamale usually eaten on Saturdays and holidays in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the American-born youngsters will have a chance to experience an event 
like the ones their parents and grandparents celebrated in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what we try to give our young people and for them to keep on doing 
this," Ocon said. "I think you should not ever forget your roots or where you 
come from."

after he was captured and executed by the Spaniards. On Aug. 24, 1821, Spain 
granted Mexico independence. 
</P>

NATURAL GAS VEHICLE PLANT FUELS INDUSTRY; TRANSPORTATION: OFFICIALS HOPE A NEW 
EAST L.A. FACILITY WILL ENCOURAGE MORE MOTORISTS TO TANK UP WITH THE CLEANER, 
CHEAPER FUEL INSTEAD OF GASOLINE. 
</P>

 If Ecotrans takes off the way Southern California Gas Co. officials hope it 
will, the gas more motorists seek before long will be all natural. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecotrans, a natural-gas vehicle production plant on an 11-acre site in East 
Los Angeles, began full operation last week. It specializes in outfitting new 
pickup trucks, vans and other vehicles with natural-gas equipment and 
converting older vehicles that run on gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that so far, the bulk of the vehicles being converted at the 
plant involve government or large-company vehicles. Still, they said, the 
widespread switch from gasoline to natural gas or other alternative fuels in 
private vehicles is inevitable, especially considering government mandates for 
a cleaner environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vehicles Ecotrans will put on the street will produce far fewer 
pollutants than conventional vehicles," said Warren Mitchell, president of the 
gas company and chairman of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, which consists 
of 250 companies in the natural-gas industry nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said natural gas lowers emissions of carbon monoxide by roughly 90%, 
compared to gasoline-powered engines, and natural gas generally costs about 40 
cents less per gallon than gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ecotrans plant, which employs about 40 workers, mostly displaced aerospace 
employees, is expected to generate several thousand jobs as conversions become 
more popular during the next few years, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 For many motorists, the drawbacks to the natural-gas system include the 
estimated $3,000 to $4,500 conversion cost and the relative scarcity of 
natural-gas refueling stations in the region -- fewer than 60. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald H. Smith, general manager at Ecotrans, said those who make the switch 
will be given map books that identify the refueling stations. And, he said, 
conversions can be done so that vehicles maintain the ability to operate on 
gasoline, switching automatically if they get low on natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that conversion costs are expected to be closer to $1,500 by the 
turn of the century because of system improvements and other factors. He 
forecast about 600 refueling stations in Southern California by that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that about 2,000 vehicles now operate on natural gas in the 
region, with about 100 of those belonging to private citizens. An estimated 
200,000 natural-gas vehicles are expected to be on the road in the area by the 
century's end. And the East Los Angeles plant hopes to produce at least 9,500 
natural gas vehicles by the end of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natural gas is much cleaner and safer," Smith said. "The chance to help the 
environment and to have this project to work on has been exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 A tour of the plant on East Olympic Boulevard near Santa Fe Avenue revealed an 
assembly line of white trucks, many of them adorned with blue-and-yellow gas 
company decals reading, "Natural Gas Powered -- For Clean 
Air-Economy-Performance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere at the complex, the vehicles at various stages of conversion 
included a United Parcel Service truck, a U.S. government military police van, 
a Marine Corps pickup truck and several U.S. Postal Service delivery trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alatorre, whose 14th District includes the plant site, said 
a major reason he supports Ecotrans is the potential for job opportunities. Oil 
industry representatives who oppose the transition to natural gas are bound to 
find out they are fighting the wave of the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have a choice," he said. "The smart ones are doing it. The dumb 
ones are going to fight the inevitable."

MAGNET SCHOOL LOGS ON TO INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY; EDUCATION: STUDENTS CAN SURF 
THE INTERNET AT THE CENTRAL LIBRARY. THE SCHOOL IS FIRST IN THE NATION TO FOCUS 
ON ELECTRONIC INFORMATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Students interested in the information superhighway and other electronic 
technology began taking classes last week at the Los Angeles Central Library, 
as part of a new program touted as the nation's first magnet school to focus on 
accessing electronic information. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90 ninth- and 10th-graders are enrolled in the voluntary program, a 
joint project of the Los Angeles Public Library and the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's Downtown Business Magnet High School. The UCLA Graduate 
School of Education and Information is also helping to develop the school's 
unique curricula and offer technical advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing else like this," said Paul McGlothlin, coordinator of the 
program. "Our program is going to really allow students to create electronic 
documents and surf the Internet. They'll have the same access to the Internet 
as a research scientist or a university student." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Lucero, one of four teachers assigned to the magnet program, said 
students will take science, math, English and social studies courses at the 
library and the rest of their classes at the Downtown Business Magnet, about a 
mile away on West Temple Street. The goal of the program, Lucero said, is to 
incorporate electronic information into almost every academic subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, in English class, students will learn how to research their 
subjects using the library's computer systems," he said. "And instead of 
keeping a notebook, they'll develop their own electronic portfolio through 
CD-ROM, where they can keep all of their assignments." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Lucero's first goals is to pair each student with a computer "pen pal" 
at a South American school and another in Puerto Rico, where he used to work. 
Once students master the concept of electronic mail, they'll move on to more 
advanced technology, like accessing the global computer network known as the 
Internet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is try to make everyone computer literate, even though we have some 
kids who are advanced and others who are afraid of the computer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Pattengale, a 15-year-old sophomore, said he enrolled as soon as he 
heard about the program because he has been interested in computers since he 
was 12. On the first day of class, Pattengale tinkered with a CD-ROM Spanish 
program at the library's Language Learning Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Computers will be a big part of the job market, so this will really help us," 
he said. "And these computers are so much nicer than the standard school 
computers. It's an ideal learning environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Students will be bused between the Downtown Business Magnet and the library. 
They will eat lunch at the business school and take physical education classes 
at the Ketchum Downtown YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is one of 24 new magnet programs created by the district this 
year. Although the school is starting with only ninth- and 10th-graders, 
juniors and seniors will be added in subsequent years. The school is still 
accepting applications from freshmen and sophomores who want to enroll this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have about 20 openings," McGlothlin said. "All we ask is for students who 
have the desire to learn. . . . We don't want our kids to become computer 
geeks. We want them to use electronic information as tools to help them in all 
of their classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth- and 10th-graders interested in enrolling in the electronic information 
magnet program should call McGlothlin at (213) 228-7504.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: MAYWOOD; FIESTA HELPS MARK CITY'S 70TH BIRTHDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the commotion died down from a fiesta last weekend celebrating the 
city's 70th birthday, longtime resident Patricio Quiles took the large 
celebration at Maywood City Park as a chance to reflect on his city's past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the first Mexican to come live in Maywood," said the 70-year-old Quiles 
in a friendly, bellowing voice.  
</P>
<P>
 "And I'll tell you -- the people here were really mad at the real estate agent 
that sold me my house." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more than 90% of Maywood's 27,850 residents are Latinos. While the 
layout of Maywood hasn't changed much in the 46 years since Quiles and his wife 
moved here from Lincoln Heights, the demographics have shifted drastically 
since the city was an enclave of mostly white residents employed, for the most 
part, in the nearby General Motors, Firestone and Uniroyal factories. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic look of the city hasn't changed much," said Quiles, citing the tidy 
blocks of well-kept homes along tree-lined streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the faces sure have." 
</P>
<P>
 According to 1990 U.S, Census figures, Maywood's Latino population grew 48% in 
the 1980s. During the same period, there was a 58% drop in the city's white 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, all of Southeast Los Angeles County saw its population shift 
dramatically in the 1980s, when there was an overall 153% jump in Latino 
residents, who now comprise 59% of the area. During the same period, there was 
a 37% drop in the number of white residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the drastic demographic shift, Maywood's other most fundamental 
change in its 70-year history has been in its economic base, said Fernando 
Guerra, a professor of political science and Chicano studies at Loyola 
Marymount University.  
</P>
<P>
 Once largely industrial-based, the city's economy is now heavily dependent on 
service industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the period following World War II up until the 1970s, Maywood, along 
with other Southeast cities, was one of the most industrialized areas in the 
world," Guerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average resident of Maywood lived the archetypal middle-class life -- and 
that's no longer the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs in steel factories or auto-manufacturing plants have long since been 
replaced by the hotel, tourism and garment industries, Guerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Incorporated in 1924 by transplants mainly from the Midwest, Maywood 
maintained a small-town feel at its outset, with most people working in the 
farming or dairy sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a real concern to maintain the character of the place," said 
Guerra. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 8-12 fiesta was the second in as many years in which residents 
gathered at Maywood City Park to celebrate the city's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said it was timed in conjunction with Mexico's Independence Day, 
which was Friday. SIMON ROMERO

 Senior Reference Librarian Marie Kaneko is determined to make sure the 
much-heralded information superhighway doesn't leave some travelers in the 
dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the information-poor who will be left behind in the future," said 
Kaneko, who heads the city's Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why it's good to get kids hooked on the Internet at an early age." 
</P>
<P>
 In Commerce, a city that is 91% Latino, that means increasing awareness about 
the potential for multicultural and multilingual access to the burgeoning 
global computer network. With that goal in mind, the library's Bristow Park 
branch hosted a free information session last week to discuss Spanish-language 
resources on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding bilingual access to the Internet is the result, in part, of a 
project funded earlier this year by the Federal Library Services and 
Construction Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The project provides 182 participating libraries with equipment, training and 
100 hours of Internet connect time.  
</P>
<P>
 In each library, a lead staff member and community resident are responsible 
for experimenting with a variety of public uses of the Internet, training 
others and sharing their experiences with each other and other libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a modem, printer and a personal computer, interested parties at a recent 
information session learned how to tap into a database with information on 
topics ranging from Mayan archeological digs to Mexican American soirees in 
Torrance to the latest news on the rebellion in Chiapas, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Bert Gallego, a social studies teacher with Montebello Unified Schools who 
attended the session, said he has come across such contrasting information as 
gossip between people living on different continents and a brilliant essay on 
recent political events. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't any standards yet, so you just don't know what you're going to 
get when you access a given database," Gallego said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gallego said, it is essential for as many people as possible to get 
access to the flood of information available on the Internet and other computer 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point the Internet is just anarchy," Gallego said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a race right now to acquire equal access to information, and it's 
clear who's winning -- those with enough money to have computers in their 
homes." SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; REDLINING CHARGED IN QUAKE-AID POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After the earthquake that devastated much of Los Angeles last January, Santa 
Barbara Plaza salon owner Robert Moore literally started picking up the pieces 
of his business. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months later, Moore is still struggling to recover. He and nearly 20 
other shop owners in the mall, located across from the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw 
Plaza, applied for small business loans but were rejected for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, the Santa Barbara Plaza's merchant association president, blames the 
rejections on what he calls redlining practices by the Small Business 
Administration. He has launched a letter-writing campaign asking local 
politicians to look into the federal agency's policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "An SBA inspector came out here and told me, 'Mr. Moore, you have a lot of 
damage,' " said the owner of Moore's Hair Designs. "I was turned down. Where is 
all the money, the help they've said has been allocated to Los Angeles for 
earthquake aid? Not in South-Central." 
</P>
<P>
 SBA spokeswoman Diane Brady denied that the agency is turning down applicants 
based on locale. The most critical factor, she said, is simply a business's 
ability to repay. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mr. Moore's case, he had a bankruptcy, which was explained thoroughly in 
the letter we sent," said Brady, whose agency has approved $3.3 billion in 
loans since the quake, nearly $200 million in Central Los Angeles. "We have a 
lot more lenient credit standards than banks, but we do need to see an ability 
to repay."  
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who footed the bill for about $8,000 in damage to his business, said he 
was initially reluctant to apply for disaster aid or emergency loans. He had 
applied two years earlier after the spring riots and, despite political 
promises and wrestling with loads of paperwork, got nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 This time he has appealed the rejection of his aid application and has sent 
letters to Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles), state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los 
Angeles), Mayor Richard Riordan and Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone here suffered damage," said Moore of the 270 plaza tenants, five of 
whom have been unable to reopen since the Jan. 17 quake. "We're all still 
working with patched-up facilities, cracked walls. We're holding on by 
threads." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said that a business's cash flow after the quake also figured 
prominently in loan decisions -- which was bad news for Mary Clinton, owner of 
Shear Creations hair salon. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton closed for two months and paid nearly $6,000 to replace broken glass 
and repair cracked walls and ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told I only had cosmetic damage and that I didn't qualify for a loan," 
she said, walking through her airy salon, nearly devoid of customers. "But it's 
not just the money. . . . I lost six operators. I've had to cancel my insurance 
because I can't afford to pay it anymore. I'm still trying to break even." 
</P>
<P>
 In the months after the quake, Bertha Fraser, a business development officer 
at the Community Financial Resource Center in Los Angeles, advised the 
merchants to apply for aid.  
</P>
<P>
 Fraser said she was at a loss when all the applicants were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know they don't look like they can pay back a loan on paper, but these 
loans shouldn't be judged like regular loans," said Fraser, whose year-old 
center provides credit counseling and technical assistance to businesses. The 
center acts as a liaison between business owners and government agencies like 
the SBA and is funded by the city and private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are struggling to get back up to pre-earthquake levels. . . . 
They're getting deeper in debt."  
</P>
<P>
 Fraser has turned to the First African Methodist Episcopal Church to arrange 
for a $300,000 loan. "We have to get the business owners help by any means 
necessary," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mark Whitlock, director of FAME Renaissance, said the church's economic 
development corporation has agreed to help. "It's unfortunate that people have 
to jump through hoops to get help in a natural disaster like the earthquake," 
he said. "The merchants shouldn't have this need to be saved. Ultimately, it 
hurts the whole community." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; FESTIVAL SINGS PRAISES OF MUSICAL 
INSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After eight months of reinventing itself as a vital fixture on the local music 
scene, the Institute of Musical Arts is throwing itself -- and the community -- 
a party. 
</P>
<P>
 The IMA Street Festival winds up from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. today in front of the 
institute on 54th Street between 10th and 11th avenues. The family-oriented 
event offers pony rides, clowns, face-painting, games and music performances 
throughout the day by about 20 rap, jazz, blues and African groups. Performers 
range from the First African Methodist Episcopal Church choir to Blay Ambolley 
and the African High Life Band. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Woodard, who along with partner John Osborne began renovating the 
building in February, said their vision of a block-long, multifaceted musical 
center is finally taking shape. Woodard and Osborne have fashioned the 
72-year-old music hall into a thriving spot for professional musicians looking 
to play, record, teach and otherwise keep up their chops. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex houses a full-fledged studio, performance stage and music history 
library, and there is enough space left over to film an occasional music video. 
The IMA is also home to the Preservation of Endangered Musical Art, Woodard's 
nonprofit group that was inspired by the rich history of the venue, for decades 
a recording and performance hall for dozens of prominent musicians -- Nancy 
Wilson, Patrice Rushen and Earth, Wind and Fire, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard, 37, speaks most proudly of what he claims is the real heart of the 
place: 48 low-cost courses that cover everything from drumming and dance to the 
basics of studio mixing and producing.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to do things simultaneously: help musicians to eat and educate the 
young about all aspects of the music business," said Woodard, himself a 
lifetime musician. "There are a lot of really good guys who have to go overseas 
to instruct. . . . We want to keep them here in town." 
</P>
<P>
 At last week's reception to kick off the festival, Woodard and Osborne were 
commended by city and state officials for their efforts not only in helping 
artists but also in creating a legacy of art for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Former state Assemblywoman Gwen Moore, who last year spearheaded an 
after-school arts program using Crenshaw-area sites, said Woodard was a 
valuable addition to her program and also the arts community. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing great things," she said. "Politicians have to involve artists more 
in improving the community, create new ways to fund and support them. There's 
too little of that." 
</P>

 Woodard said that's fine with him, although those he is most bent on 
converting are musicians themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Musicians have a $50 mentality. You open up your doors and tell them there's 
opportunity to make real money and they're suspicious," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing in the world is to make them believe in what we're doing. 
Once they settle into the idea they can make a sell-able product, they say, 
'Let's get on with it.' "

<P>
 The Kiwanis Club of Angeles Mesa is holding a reception Saturday for Celes 
King III to celebrate the bail bondsman's 50 years as a community leader and 
civil rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 years, King, 70, has owned a bail bond agency at 1528 W. Martin Luther 
King Blvd. that has also served as the operation site for a number of 
organizations he has either founded or helped to launch.Among them are the 
state Congress of Racial Equality and the Martin Luther King Kingdom Day 
Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 King co-founded the Brotherhood Crusade in Los Angeles and was instrumental in 
changing the name of Santa Barbara Plaza to King Boulevard. He also served in 
the military as a state reserve brigadier general, and was an officer in the 
Tuskegee Airmen, an all-black unit of the U.S. Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 King was sidelined in April after suffering serious injuries during a robbery 
and assault in the Mid-City area, but has since recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The anniversary event starts at 7 p.m. at the Beverly Hills Country Club, 3084 
Motor Ave. Cost is $50. Information: (213) 298-8777.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WESTLAKE; DREAMS MAY SPRING FROM THE RUBBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the dusty, rubble-covered lot where the McKinley Mansion once stood, Verona 
Lopez envisions trees, grass, a playground filled with children and a garden 
where senior citizens can tend flowers and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 A community center with green space is a dream that she and other residents 
believe can rise from the ashes of the abandoned 1915 Italian Renaissance-style 
landmark, which was destroyed May 23 in a fire that killed two homeless men. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and other members of the Benton Way Neighborhood Assn. have launched a 
full-scale effort to turn the rubble at 310 S. Lafayette Park Place, which was 
once the home of mortuary tycoon Maytor H. McKinley, into a community and 
recreation space. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need playgrounds in this area," said Lopez, a semi-retired architect and 
space designer who has lived around the corner from the site for 18 years. 
"There are not enough parks." 
</P>
<P>
 The association is enlisting the aid of city officials and a nonprofit agency 
to help it prepare a plan and a sale offer to present to Lafayette Towers East 
Partners, the developers who bought the site after its last occupant died in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Although principal partner Menashe Kozar did not return calls, Lopez said that 
she spoke with him last week and that he seemed willing to consider the group's 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wouldn't tell me how much the property was worth, but he did tell me to 
get a proposal together and put in an offer so that at least we'll have 
something to talk about, something he can take back to the other investors," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Shishim, a preservation coordinator for the city's Department of 
Building and Safety, said the owners have not filed development plans since the 
fire. However, plans from 1989 -- when the owners attempted to tear down the 
protected property with an illegally obtained demolition permit in an effort to 
get on with construction -- called for a 140-unit apartment complex, which 
neighbors said is the last thing the area needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have enough of those rat warrens already," said Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood association has been working with the nonprofit Search to 
Involve Pilipino Americans to draw up a plan for a small, low-income senior and 
multifamily complex, which would share the three-acre site with a child-care 
center, a playground, a learning center and library for children, and a 
community recreation center with gardens and green space. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Jacinto, executive director of the Pilipino Americans organization, said 
he came into contact with Lopez while conducting a site search for senior and 
multifamily housing. Jacinto is enthusiastic about the prospect of a mixed-use 
community project, and said his group is checking into various sources for 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 David Marquez, a senior deputy for City Councilman Mike Hernandez, who 
represents the area, said that many of Westlake's high-density complexes have a 
large number of vacancies. That and the sagging real estate market, he said, 
could give the owners reason to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have apartment buildings just for the sake of having apartment 
buildings," he said. "We have high density with high vacancies. We need quality 
housing, not these little cracker boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 A housing project that involves senior citizens is something Marquez believes 
could qualify for city funds. He finds the idea of combining senior citizens 
with youths in one community center especially appealing because the majority 
of residents in Hernandez's 1st District are younger than 18 or older than 50, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the group's original plan had been to save and incorporate two small 
structures, a carriage house and gazebo, which survived the fire. However, the 
carriage house was heavily damaged Aug. 19 by an arsonist, and both structures 
were demolished by the owners last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department officials are wrapping up their investigation of the May 23 
blaze. If arson is determined as the cause, police said, the two deaths will be 
considered homicides, and any suspects apprehended will be tried accordingly.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; SURGE IN ROBBERIES PROMPTS WARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Korean community who do business, enjoy the night life and live 
in the area must adjust some of their habits to avoid being victimized by an 
increase in robberies, police and community leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 71 robberies, many of them armed, occurred in Koreatown during 
August, said Officer Ben Kwon. Forty-five were reported in July, a number he 
said is average for the area. The Wilshire District already has one of the 
highest robbery rates in the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The robbery problem, specifically, has been on the upswing in Koreatown for 
about the past three years," said Officer Chuck Newman. "Word has gotten out 
among criminals that it's easy pickings in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims are Korean immigrants, Newman said. The problem is that 
criminals in the area are preying on the naivete of the immigrants, 
particularly merchants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been lots of business owners robbed outside banks, bringing money 
to and from their businesses," said Greg Jeong, team leader for the Gramercy 
Place Neighborhood Watch. "They have cash, so they are targeted." 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Won, a special projects director for the Korean Youth and Community 
Center who has worked closely with police as part of the community-based 
Koreatown Watch Team, said many in the Korean community -- especially merchants 
and recent immigrants -- put themselves in jeopardy through their banking 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rumor on the street is that Koreans carry lots of cash, and sometimes 
it's true," he said. "Business owners take their last day's sales to the bank, 
and it's easy for criminals to wait for them in front." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman recalled one incident in which a Korean woman took $55,000 out of a 
bank in a burlap bag and was robbed shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to change their methods of banking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, there has also been an increase in robberies involving bar and 
restaurant patrons who flock to the area's Korean eateries and nightclubs. 
Several recent robbery incidents have involved suspects assaulting intoxicated 
patrons leaving establishments late at night, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Won, who patrolled streets with the Koreatown Watch Team, said he has often 
seen patrons leaving restaurants and bars who would make perfect victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of people who are drunk and think they can walk home," he 
said. "I've asked myself, 'If I were a criminal, would I hit that person?' The 
answer is yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilshire police kicked off their efforts to curb the robbery trend with a 
30-officer task force saturation of the area two Friday nights ago. Kwon said 
the weekend deployments are expected to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said the division is preparing a public education campaign targeting 
the Korean community. By the end of the month, he said, flyers will be 
circulated describing how drinking alcohol can make people easy prey for 
robbers. Police also plan to work with bar and restaurant proprietors to warn 
patrons to play it safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilshire Division also plans to set up community meetings at banks and 
other public places to educate citizens about the dangers they face when going 
about their business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe to say this is a top priority," Newman said. LESLIE BERESTEIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: CITY TERRACE; MURAL HONORS YOUTH OF MEXICO, EASTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new mural at City Terrace Elementary School depicts an event in Mexico's 
history in which six young cadets gave their lives to defend their country. But 
it also honors today's children who risk their lives, sometimes just getting to 
school each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Ninos Heroes del Este Los Angeles, painted by students at the Academia de 
Art Yepes, is based on an 1847 battle in which 13- to 20-year-old Mexican Army 
cadets died in a battle against the U.S. Army. The date that "Los Ninos Heroes" 
died, Sept. 13, is celebrated throughout Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the school's 450 students will be studying the Mexican War battle with the 
help of the 10-by-20-foot canvas mural that hangs in the auditorium. The 
bright, sweeping colors show the cadets in cameos above a collage of City 
Terrace sites, including St. Lucy's Catholic Church, the City Terrace 
Elementary School and children who are composites of the school's students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge was how to update (the history) to present day," said artist 
George Yepes, who runs the free art academy at Salesian High that enrolls 60 
students from throughout the county. "The kids have to be heroes to make it to 
school and get back. They're the heroes of today." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the mural came from parents and students and members of the City 
Terrace Coordinating Council, which for seven years has recognized those who 
have contributed to the community through its annual Ninos Heroes Award. Former 
recipients include Los Angeles Unified School District Board Chairwoman Leticia 
Quezada and Assistant Superintendent Ruben Zacarias. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the heroes of today," Gloria Chavez, president of the coordinating 
council, said of the school's students. "Our children will know that there's 
something they can do, and they don't have to get killed in the gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 As the mural was unveiled Tuesday to about 200 youngsters, several gasped and 
then wildly applauded. Some whistled and stood to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful," said Julia Quiros, 10, who attended the unveiling with her 
fifth-grade class.  
</P>
<P>
 The mural project, which included meetings with parents, children and 
community members over the summer, has taught many about the historical event. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who admitted to knowing little about the "Heroes" was Principal 
Dennis Martinez. He told the students that awards ceremonies, graduations and 
other important events that take place at the school will be accompanied by the 
towering mural on the auditorium stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our school has received something very, very wonderful and it's something 
that we'll be studying all year long," Martinez said. "And when you're all 
grown up, you'll be able to come back and see it." 
</P>
<P>
 He watched as the children walked up to the mural after the presentation with 
their teachers to get a closer look.  
</P>
<P>
 "The fundamental aspects of the mural are the children and they're declared 
the new heroes because they are going to continue their education," Martinez 
said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: LINCOLN HEIGHTS; TENANTS TO OWN 132-UNIT COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of Mission Plaza Apartments plan to celebrate Sept. 30, the day 
their tenants association will become the owners of the 132-unit complex where 
many of them have paid rent for 20 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents' association will be the first in the city to take advantage of 
a federal program to help renters buy their buildings, said Anna Ortega-Garcia, 
manager of the city Housing Department's Prepayment Program. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 20 years of paying rent, finally we'll become the owners," said Miguel 
Castellanos, president of Mission Plaza Tenants Assn., which initiated the 
process to buy the property two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of things we're going to have more in our favor. Everyone's 
waiting for Sept. 30." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have been attending Sunday morning classes held by representatives 
of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development to learn about 
becoming owners and handling a payroll to establish their own management 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction, funded in part by a $900,000 low-interest loan from the city 
Housing Department, will enable most tenants to pay no more than 30% of their 
income for rent. The total cost to buy and renovate the building is estimated 
at $8.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD, which loaned $7.5 million to Mission Plaza Tenants Assn., has identified 
145 buildings with 10,000 units in Los Angeles that qualify for this program, 
Ortega-Garcia said.  
</P>
<P>
 Owners who received 40-year loans on their property have the option of selling 
after 20 years, she said, but under the 1987 Emergency Low Income Housing 
Preservation Act and a similar bill passed in 1990, owners must first offer to 
sell their property to the tenants to keep the number of affordable units 
available.  
</P>
<P>
 If the tenants or a tenant-approved nonprofit agency opts not to buy the 
property after 15 months, the owners can sell the property to an outside 
individual, who may not want to keep the units affordable, Ortega-Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't buy the units, another company could buy it and get rid of the 
Section 8" housing subsidy, Castellanos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 132 families who live here and only 17 people here pay the top 
rent. The rest of the people qualify for help under Section 8."  
</P>
<P>
 The city started its prepayment program to fill the gap left by HUD financing, 
which covers 95% of the purchase price, Ortega-Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants of two apartment complexes in the San Fernando Valley are going 
through the process of buying their buildings, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not every day that a group of tenants can buy their building," she said. 
"It gives them more of a say in the decision-making in, say, the maintenance of 
their building." 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants of Mission Plaza have a wish list of improvements they want to 
make to the 26-year-old complex, including newer and safer playground 
equipment, more lights to improve security and more plants and grass. They also 
want to raise a wall to stop vandals from climbing over.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think these things are going to improve as soon as we receive the units," 
Castellanos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to work on these things. Everybody wants to work." MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
 Big Brothers of Greater Los Angeles will begin its campaign Tuesday to 
increase the number of Latino men to mentor Latino boys, who make up a large 
percentage of the organization's rolls locally. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy troupe Culture Clash will unveil the Latino Outreach Campaign at a 
11:30 a.m. luncheon at Tamayo's Restaurant, 5300 E. Olympic Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization hopes to make more Latino matches because their common 
culture and language may help to increase the level of understanding and 
comfort between them, said spokeswoman Leslie Diaz. Latino boys make up 
one-third of the boys in need of adult mentoring; only 7% of the Big Brothers 
in Los Angeles are Latino, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In March the Big Brothers opened an office at the East Los Angeles Skills 
Center, 3921 Selig Place, to increase the organization's presence in the Latino 
community.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; ON COMMON GROUND TO STRESS EDUCATION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gathered in a recreation room at the Firestone Community Day Center, a group 
of youths listened to actor Mike Farrell speak about choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walking the walk and talking the talk may make you feel safe in a small 
territory, but it's a much bigger world out there. You have a choice in 
education," said Farrell, who portrayed a doctor on the 1970s TV series "MASH." 
"If you don't believe you can do it, then you won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell's visit was part of Common Ground Foundation's Back-to-School 
Celebrity Walk Week. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the 15 youngsters listened patiently to Farrell, some didn't 
hesitate to counter his words. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that simple. You can't be slipping up in the street," said Denise, 
who attends the center, a school for 13- to 18-year-olds who are on probation. 
"I don't believe it. How many of us are able to get outside of the blue and 
red," she asked, referring to the gang colors of the Crips and the Bloods.  
</P>
<P>
 But another, Tray, said Farrell's words gave him some hope: "Now, I don't have 
a choice; it's where I live. But once I graduate, then I'll start thinking 
about getting out." 
</P>
<P>
 Common Ground Foundation is a 16-year-old, nonprofit organization based in 
Markham Middle School in Watts that works with youths, encouraging them to 
continue their education rather than pursue a career on the streets. The 
organization reaches about 2,000 youths, primarily at Jordan High, the 102nd 
Street and Markham middle schools, and the Firestone day center. 
</P>
<P>
 Founder and director Fred Williams, himself a former gang member, leads his 
staff of ex-gang members and youths on parole on educational drives and 
campaigns to keep children in school. Williams said other obstacles that youths 
face include a lack of money for school supplies or a simple haircut that may 
boost self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to provide an environment that will make it easier for them to go to 
school," he said. "We are like a combination of truant officers and social 
workers." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday evening, Common Ground was to host a back-to-school haircut marathon 
at the Jordan Downs Housing Project, giving free haircuts for about four hours. 
The group also planned to pass out clothing, 1,000 backpacks and other school 
items to culminate its return-to-school program. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Belafonte, Tony Danza, Debbie Allen and the rap group Public Enemy are 
among those who have walked through inner-city schools to speak about the 
importance of education through its back-to-school program. Danny Glover was 
also a recent guest speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet the organization's approach has riled some with its unconventional 
staff.  
</P>
<P>
 Warren Furutani, the Los Angeles Unified School District board member who 
represents Watts, said Williams' casual demeanor and aggressive attitude toward 
reeling children back into classes by using youths with a criminal history 
generate negative reaction from some school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "His style is not traditional," Furutani said. But "the program wouldn't be as 
successful if his approach was traditional. . . . (Common Ground) brings back 
the kids."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; HOPE IN YOUTH PLANS A THANK-YOU PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to bring a little harmony to its neighborhood, Hope in Youth is hosting 
a day of thanks for its surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The church-based, nonprofit anti-gang organization will host a day of free 
activities dubbed "Hope in the Hood" on Sept. 25 from 6 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. in 
the parking lots of St. Francis Cabrini Catholic Church, at Normandie Avenue 
and Imperial Highway, and Phillips Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, 
971 E. 43rd St. 
</P>
<P>
 Activities scheduled at both sites include mini-tournaments in basketball, 
softball and volleyball; seminars on parenting, drug and gang prevention; 
performances by gospel choirs and mariachis, and a barbecue. The event's 
special guest is Kay LaRon of television's daytime soap opera "The Bold and the 
Beautiful."  
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is present an atmosphere where people can get to know each 
other," said Greg Flynn, event organizer at the 43rd Street site. "It's so 
people in the community are not just faces in a crowd. We hope to get a good 
number of blacks and Latinos in the community and break bread together." 
</P>
<P>
 Hope in Youth is expecting about 500 people at the events. The organization, 
whose backers come from 10 religious denominations and which recently received 
a $2.5-million city appropriation, focuses on youths who are in danger of drug 
or gang involvement.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CHINATOWN; PART OF L.A. HISTORY MAY FIND A HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Chinese historical group plans to purchase and restore two Victorian houses 
as part of a nearly $2-million project to develop what could become Chinatown's 
first heritage and visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This can be seen as one part of the overall concept of developing cultural 
resources in Chinatown," said Eugene Moy, building committee chairman for the 
Chinese Historical Society of Southern California. "There's a need for smaller 
and quality (cultural) facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly 20-year-old historical society recently opened escrow on the houses 
at 411 and 415 Bernard St., at the northern end of Chinatown near the Pasadena 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 To finalize the $375,000 purchase, the group needs to raise $18,750 by 
November to make the first payment on the 10,000-square-foot property, Moy 
said. The houses are on adjoining lots; one is vacant and the other is leased 
by a property management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The society has developed a three- to five-year plan for the project, 
estimated to cost between $1.5 million and $1.9 million. After restoring and 
seismically upgrading the two wood-framed buildings, society members want to 
open the house at 411 Bernard St. as a heritage and visitors center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1886 by French immigrant Philipp Fritz, the house would reflect 
Chinese history in Los Angeles as well as the Latino, Italian, French, Croatian 
and African American ethnic mix that once populated Chinatown, Moy said. One 
room would be dedicated to the Fritz family; the immigrant's daughter Louise M. 
Whiting lived in the home from 1892 until her death in 1992, and the family 
still owns the property. 
</P>
<P>
 That building would also become the permanent site for the Chinese Historical 
Society, which now leases space in the Phoenix Bakery building in Chinatown, 
Moy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once open, the center could establish a renewed interest in Chinatown and 
boost its economy, society members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be an information center for our educational purposes," 
society President Irvin Lai said.  
</P>
<P>
 The society plans to lease the second house, built in 1892, and would like to 
see it turned into a bookstore and coffee shop. The final phase of the project 
would entail construction behind both houses of a three-story, 
6,000-square-foot building for cultural education classes, Moy and Lai said. 
</P>
<P>
 A courtyard between the new structure and the two Victorian houses would 
include some kind of artwork to recognize early Chinatown pioneers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The society hopes to help finance the project by expanding its fund-raising 
efforts beyond the Chinese community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significance of this location goes beyond Chinese history," Moy said. "It 
really goes into Los Angeles history. So we hope to bring in the general public 
of Los Angeles." TOMMY LI

BOYS & GIRLS CLUB OPENS IN CASA LOMA 
</P>

<BYLINE>

By ENRIQUE LAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 500 local youngsters have a new place to play -- and learn. 
</P>
<P>
 The month-old Boys & Girls Club at the Casa Loma housing project offers 
tutoring, computer education, outdoor recreation and environmental 
education.Drug, gang and teen pregnancy prevention programs are also offered to 
the 8- to 18-year-old residents of Casa Loma. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Loma is a 110-unit, low-income housing project three blocks south of 
Belmont High that caters to single-parent families, predominantly those headed 
by Latinas. The $18-million development, which was designed with built-in space 
for support services, is an effort by New Economics for Women, a nonprofit, 
Downtown-based organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We developed a relationship with the clubs and looked at the programs that 
they offered and thought it was perfect for the Casa Loma residents to use," 
said Maggie Cervantes, the organization's executive director.  
</P>
<P>
 Boys & Girls Clubs aim to fill a longstanding void in neighborhoods where 
children have few alternatives to substance abuse or gang involvement, said 
Maria Lopez-Henderson, regional service director of the clubs. "That is where 
the biggest gap is here," she said. "The basic strategy is working in 
conjunction with housing projects." 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide organization has only two other inner-city clubs, Challengers 
in South Central and Watts-Willowbrook, which serve about 3,500 youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez-Henderson said the organization is attempting to develop programs in the 
Imperial Court, Nickerson Gardens and Jordan Downs housing projects in Watts. 
Schools in lower-income areas are also target sites, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the Casa Loma Club was funded by an $85,000 grant from AT&T. 
Youth activities are provided from 9 a.m to 9 p.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys & Girls Clubs of America leads a network of 1,600 neighborhood-based 
facilities, which serve more than 2 million youths, primarily from 
disadvantaged areas.

COVER STORY; SILENT MAJORITY; THE PLIGHT OF ASIAN AMERICAN STUDENTS; TORN BY

 AFTER A LOCAL NEWSPAPER published a list of Korean American valedictorians and 
other students heading to Ivy League schools, Sang Je's father cut out the 
picture of one of his son's Harvard-bound classmates and tacked it up on the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Je -- now a freshman at UC Berkeley -- is hardly an academic slouch, 
he knew it was his father's way of telling him he should have done better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to cry about it," the 18-year-old Temple City High graduate said. "But 
I just learned to live with it. All Korean kids do. The night that the list 
runs in the Korean newspapers, you know a lot of Korean kids are crying their 
eyes out because their parents are giving them a hard time for not being on the 
list." 
</P>
<P>
 Coping with relentless parental pressure is just one of the issues confronting 
many Asian American teen-agers, whose problems are often misunderstood or 
simply overlooked by their non-Asian classmates and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian students are a minority among minorities at most Los Angeles schools. 
Outnumbered by blacks and Latinos at most urban campuses and by white students 
at suburban and private schools, they struggle to distinguish themselves at a 
time when issues of race and identity increasingly divide students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asians learn to function in life playing the second fiddle," said Chi K. Mui, 
a member of the Los Angeles Unified School District's Asian Pacific American 
Education Commission, a group that advises the school board on Asian American 
issues. "They're lonely, but they become stoic. They just learn to live with 
their problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Although stereotyped as "model students" who have little trouble breezing 
through honors classes and getting into top colleges, Asian students often are 
burdened with unique family and social problems that few non-Asian teachers and 
students understand. For one thing, many Asian youths are pressured by their 
peers to date and socialize, while their parents expect them to conform to 
traditional Asian values and devote their time to their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also common for Asian students -- particularly recent immigrants -- to be 
picked on and called derogatory names such as geek and fob , for "fresh off the 
boat." This, coupled with parental academic expectations, can make schooling a 
lonely experience indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have real stereotypes of Asian American kids as being Westinghouse 
scholars or National Merit finalists, when in fact that's not always the case," 
said Kenyon Chan, director of the Asian American Studies Department at Cal 
State Northridge. "There's a misconception that Asian kids don't need any help, 
so they often get ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 After coming to the Los Angeles area from Vietnam in 1985, Dat Nguyen attended 
a mostly Latino elementary school in El Monte. Although other students at the 
school also spoke English as a second language, Nguyen was among the campus's 
only Vietnamese- and Cantonese-speaking students. "I didn't have a lot of 
friends," said the 17-year-old recent Rosemead High graduate. "I would get 
picked on." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior high proved to be no easier for Nguyen, who learned English but still 
found it difficult to make friends. Although he formed friendships with various 
Asian students during high school, Nguyen said that fitting in was always 
something he and other Asian teen-agers struggled with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though there were a lot of Asians at Rosemead High, they were pretty 
quiet and stayed on the sidelines," he said. "They don't have a voice and don't 
really get involved in things like sports or cheerleading. They do good in 
school, but they don't have a chance to speak out." 
</P>
<P>
 When Je arrived from Korea as a fifth-grader, he said he was constantly teased 
for not speaking English well, for wearing knee-high socks and for having a 
"rice bowl" haircut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other kids used to call me gook and chink ," he said. "A lot of Asian kids 
can relate to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Le Truong, a sophomore at Los Angeles High, also experienced discrimination 
while growing up in El Sereno with few other Asian students. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was little, other kids picked on me and called me names," she said. 
"Some Asian kids at my school were thrown into the trash can even though they 
didn't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time to attend high school, Truong first enrolled at her 
neighborhood school, Garfield High, which is predominantly Latino. But after a 
week, she withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated it," she said. "People weren't nice to me. I felt really ugly there." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the roughly 640,000 students in the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
only 5%, or 31,700, are Asian. Among the 30,600 teachers, support personnel and 
administrators, just over 7% are Asian, according to 1993 district figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of those relatively small numbers, Asian students' problems are often 
regarded as less important than other students', the youths said. As a result, 
many Asian students internalize their problems and choose not to discuss them 
with their non-Asian teachers and classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the 1992 riots, a group of Korean students at Crenshaw High 
were afraid to return, fearing they might be attacked by other students on 
campus, said Brad Pilon, a counselor at the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's Newcomers Center, which recently moved from Crenshaw High to Belmont 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of relying on school administrators to resolve any potential 
conflicts, the students only talked among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Korean students refused to talk to me because they had seen me talking to 
black students," said Pilon, who is white. "They saw it as 'us-versus-them' and 
regarded administrators as a threat. They feel they can only let their hair 
down with each other." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every one of the more than two dozen Asian students interviewed for 
this story agreed that most Asian students tend to hang out together. While 
some recent immigrants tend to feel most comfortable with students from the 
same countries, it's common for Asian students of all different backgrounds to 
befriend one another, the students said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asian kids hang out together because they feel more comfortable with each 
other," Je said. "We all have to deal with the same family pressures and 
cultural values, so we don't have to do a lot of explaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Asian teen-agers form friendships with students of other races, 
Je said most of his close friends are Taiwanese. "My Asian friends would tease 
me if I started hanging out with white kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, rifts do exist among Asian students, the largest between recent 
immigrants and those born or raised in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Chung, a Larchmont Village resident who attends Notre Dame Academy in 
Westwood, constantly juggles her time between her recent-immigrant friends from 
Korea and her Korean American friends because of the tensions between the two 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really caused me problems because my Americanized Korean friends and my 
recent immigrant friends don't get along," said Chung, who arrived from Korea 
when she was 5 and considers herself part of the "1.5 generation." "My 
second-generation and 1.5-generation friends call the Korean immigrant kids 
fobs and nerds, and my Korean immigrant friends look down on Korean Americans 
because they feel they've lost their Korean culture." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Zhang, a recent Chinese immigrant attending Crenshaw High, said divisions 
exist because many Asian American students don't want to associate with 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese students who were born here are more Americanized," he said. 
"They make fun of us, and they don't speak Chinese. It's easier for them, 
though, because they speak English." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those differences and regardless of whether they were born here or 
recently arrived, most Asian teen-agers are united in their experiences with 
parental pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I come home with an A-minus, my mom will say, 'How come you couldn't get 
an A?' " said Julia Kim, a second-generation Korean American sophomore at 
Harvard-Westlake School in North Hollywood. "She's always comparing me to other 
Koreans at school or to my sister." 
</P>
<P>
 Dung Ly, a recent graduate of Van Nuys High School who arrived from Vietnam in 
1983, remembered the time she told her parents she was getting a B. "My parents 
said, 'Why do you get a B?' My dad said I was stupid when I got a B." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Ly and other Asian teens spend much of their time studying, 
constantly fretting about how they'll fare on their next report card. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most first-generation Korean parents are like, 'My son has to go to Harvard,' 
" said Soung Ae Kim, a Korean American parent and president of the Valley 
Korean Parents Assn. "The kids get very depressed and resentful because their 
parents don't seem to appreciate their hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Asian parents scrutinize their children's report cards, many Asian 
teen-agers said they don't talk to their parents about anything beyond their 
grades. This is particularly evident among immigrant students, whose parents 
speak little English and are unfamiliar with the American school system or 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just don't understand," Julia Kim said. "They're traditional Korean 
parents, so they're really strict. They don't let me go out or do anything. So 
I just keep everything to myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Mui, who immigrated from Hong Kong when he was 10 and now has two children at 
Castelar Elementary School in Chinatown, said immigrant parents often pay 
little attention to their children's problems because they're so busy 
themselves trying to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents had to work all the time, so they weren't able to give me any 
guidance or direction," he said. "Parents are only thinking about putting food 
on the table and paying the rent. . . . The problem is that when parents don't 
get involved in their children's schooling, it separates them from their kids. 
There's minimal bonding between parents and kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Being forbidden to socialize is another source of contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Chinese parents don't let their kids go out, date or even talk on 
the phone because that's not what teen-agers do in China," said Jian Hua Mei, a 
Chinese American teacher at the Newcomers Center. "But it's a struggle for 
kids, because dating is important to teen-agers here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kit Ying Li, a 16-year-old Hong Kong native attending Crenshaw High, said 
girls particularly have a hard time because Asian parents expect them to stay 
home until they get married. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a fight with my mother last night because I asked her if I could go out 
with my friends," she said. "She just said, 'No.' Maybe she'll let me go on a 
field trip, but she won't let me go to a camp or a dance. She just expects me 
to stay home and study." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some students said they obey their parents and stay home, others 
rebel by sneaking out of the house or lying to their parents about their 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 One 15-year-old girl said she has a boyfriend, but she hasn't told her parents 
because they would forbid her to see him. "My parents are still living the old 
way," she said. "It's really annoying." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, an increasing number of Asian youths have been lured into 
gangs, a trend some gang experts believe may be an act of defiance against the 
pressures at school and at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of newer immigrant kids settle in barrios, where there is heavy gang 
involvement," said Ernest Takemoto, a deputy probation officer for Los Angeles 
County's Asian Gang Unit. "They go to school and being of a smaller stature, 
they get picked on. They feel a lot more protected if they're in a gang. The 
gang becomes their family." 
</P>
<P>
 Takemoto said the "model minority" stereotype of Asian students also helps to 
fuel some of their frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always been a stereotype that Asians are model students, but some of 
them aren't so intelligent and rebel," Takemoto said. "Either you're a top 
student or you're not. And if you're in the middle or the low end, there's a 
problem."

 Calling all moon lovers, calling all moon lovers: Round celestial object 
insight today at the fifth annual Chinese Moon Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 From 7 to 9 p.m., you can join a full-moon viewing party at Broadway and Cesar 
E. Chavez Avenue to cap a day of carnival activities and multicultural stage 
performances ranging from dance to martial arts to excerpts from Chinese 
operas. 
</P>

 In the Chinese tradition, the festival is held on the 15th day of the eighth 
lunar month (on Tuesday) and marks the end of the summer harvest. Family and 
friends usually gather to eat "moon cakes" filled with ground lotus, sesame 
seeds and sometimes a golden egg yoke to signify the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Free tea and cakes will be available for moon viewers, said Sue Yee, events 
coordinator for the Chinese Chamber of Commerce.

VOICES: THE NEXT STEP TOWARD HOME; TANYA TULL HELPS HOMELESS GO BEYOND 
TEMPORARY SHELTER AND INTO RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TANYA TULL, Tanya Tull has worked with homeless families for 15 years, 
watching from the front lines as the homeless population swelled. She founded 
and continues to direct Para Los Ninos, a Skid Row agency that helps homeless 
families, and since 1988, has been executive director of Beyond Shelter, which 
seeks to place families in permanent housing and help them stay there by 
providing help with negotiating leases and finding child care, job training and 
other services. She was interviewed by Catherine Gewertz. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, the initial response of communities to homelessness, 
particularly the big cities who saw it first, was to create emergency shelter. 
Everyone thought it was a temporary situation. But the numbers of homeless 
families kept increasing. I saw the same families get recycled through every 
program in town. With emergency shelters, you are just giving someone a place 
to stay. But unless they have someone help them get into an apartment, and they 
can afford it, what kind of lasting help are you really giving them? 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid- to late-'80s people working with homeless families decided we 
needed to do transitional housing, to help people learn how to live 
independently. The problem there is that you're lumping together all people who 
lose their housing. That's not effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of how a 30-year-old mother of three feels. She used to work until she 
had babies, then her husband dumped her, and now because she lacks housing she 
is forced to take parenting and housekeeping classes. It's demeaning. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided in '87 we were doing something wrong. We needed to fill in the gap. 
Many of us working with the homeless have backtracked and turned around. If 
someone is on the street and needs a place to stay, getting shelter is only the 
first step. We needed to get families from emergency shelters to agencies 
through which they would be relocated to permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you are in a residential neighborhood, that's where you create 
self-esteem, that's where you learn real skills, when you have a real grocery 
store and a real kitchen to cook in. It helps break the cycle of hopelessness 
and fear. 
</P>
<P>
 We help families overcome the barriers to housing: negotiating leases, 
overcoming bad credit histories. We offer landlords a case agent for each 
family that will help them solve problems that might interfere with paying 
their rent. 
</P>
<P>
 We've moved over 600 families since we started in April, 1989. A hundred of 
them were interviewed recently and 94% were still in the same housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing that's important is that those families are no different than the 
families in their neighborhoods. We should be moving toward neighborhood 
support agencies for everyone who is about to lose their housing. They would 
offer crisis intervention for job loss, sudden single parenthood, family 
violence. They could offer survival-skills training like housekeeping, how to 
manage on a low income, how to shop economically, cook more nutritionally, 
child-care assistance so people can work. Also, welfare and legal advocacy. 
Many times people become homeless because they are denied benefits or wages. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a whole generation of young children who are going to grow up 
dysfunctional. In school, the kids are embarrassed and may not do well. Parents 
can take out their frustrations on the kids. Kids as young as 7 or 8 take on a 
parenting role for parents who have fallen apart. They need counseling and 
support to put it back together.

VOICES: THE PERSONAL TOUCH; BEYOND SHELTER MADE MARI E. QUATES AND HER CHILDREN 
'FEEL SPECIAL.' THE PROGRAM, SHE SAYS, TURNED HER LIFE AROUND AND RESTORED 
STABILITY TO HER FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARI E. QUATES, Mari E. Quates, 35, of South-Central, is a mother of three 
children ages 4 to 10. The former legal word processor lost her apartment and 
became unable to work after her divorce and the birth of a congenitally ill 
girl. She turned to Beyond Shelter, a program that places homeless families in 
apartments and provides up to one year of comprehensive services, including 
household management, health referrals and legal advocacy. She was interviewed 
by Nancy Slate. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of things went wrong in my life very quickly. I was married, with two 
children and a home. Then my husband and I separated. Right away, I moved in 
with friends and relatives because I felt I had to ground myself and get 
reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried to get an apartment. I had a work history, so I didn't think I'd have 
problems. But while my husband and I were together we had two evictions, and 
those stay on your record for seven years. No one would rent to us. 
</P>
<P>
 The stress level of living in someone else's home is very high. After a while, 
you're invading their privacy. And two small children, no matter how quiet you 
try to keep them, are still children. I felt like a burden, even though I 
cooked, cleaned and bought my own food. 
</P>
<P>
 It was very hard on the kids, too. They weren't settled. My son would scream 
and holler almost every night, and he started fighting with his little sister. 
They couldn't have the freedom to do normal, everyday things like run into the 
living room and turn on the television. 
</P>
<P>
 A while later, when I was still living with others, I had my third child. She 
was born with a condition that causes chronic heart failure that had to be 
surgically corrected. All of this was devastating for me. I didn't know where 
to turn. I kept thinking, "Why is this happening to me?" 
</P>
<P>
 I also had an on-and-off drug and alcohol problem from the ages of 16 to 32. I 
was able to stop using when I was pregnant, and at other times. But I kept 
going back. 
</P>
<P>
 I began putting in housing applications everywhere -- Los Angeles County, 
Orange County, all over. But I was constantly turned down because of the two 
evictions.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of my baby's illness, the law required me to either stay home and take 
care of her, or to provide a licensed vocational nurse, which I couldn't 
afford. So I had to seek federal assistance. That was a terrible experience. 
One place provided housing assistance. Another gave clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers were tired and overworked from huge caseloads. They put us in 
groups and stereotyped us. I had one worker say to an administrator on the 
phone: "This one's clean." "This one" -- no reference to me as a human being. 
The whole process made me feel degraded. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was referred to Beyond Shelter, it was so different, so much more 
personal. People were happy to help me. They offered me coffee and milk for my 
baby. They cried with me. My case manager became our friend. And once someone 
called me out of the blue and said, "Mari, I have something for your baby." 
That made me feel special. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Shelter turned my entire life around. First they got me into an 
apartment by convincing the manager that they would back me up. Once when my 
welfare check didn't come they gave me emergency assistance to pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Every month my case manager came to my house. We filled out a goal-oriented 
form. She taught me to budget within my means. I was under a lot of stress, so 
she referred my kids and me to low-cost counseling that we couldn't have had 
otherwise. My kids got new clothes and a wonderful letter of recommendation 
that allowed me to enroll them in programs that have helped them. 
</P>
<P>
 I started feeling so good about myself that I wanted to stop doing drugs and 
alcohol. So I got professional help and I've been clean for about three years. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to be confused, disoriented and severely depressed. Now, I look at 
myself in such a different light that sometimes I don't even know it's me. I've 
redeveloped the self-confidence and self-esteem that I lost over the years.  
</P>
<P>
 My kids are better, too. It took almost a year after we got stable, but my son 
is a peaceful little boy again. My oldest daughter used to be very introverted, 
and now she's really outgoing. My baby had her surgery and now she's doing 
fine. And I get a lot more respect from them. 
</P>
<P>
 These days I volunteer at Beyond Shelter whenever they need me. I'm enrolled 
in the Loyola-Marymount University Drug and Alcohol Studies Program, which is a 
1 1/2-year certificate program. But that's not where I'm stopping. I want to go 
all the way and be a full-fledged lawyer, then combine the two fields, drug and 
alcohol counseling with the legal field. And I want to open the first legal 
counseling program at Beyond Shelter.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I say to to myself, "Mari, you don't have that type of background. 
But you have the talent and the skill. So put it in God's hands, because God 
has done bigger miracles."

GAME OF THE WEEK; FREMONT STEALS 34-28 WIN AS TIME RUNS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 In a fitting conclusion to a game of big plays, Fremont linebacker Cedric 
Hughes scored on a 26-yard interception return as time ran out to lift the 
visiting Pathfinders to a 34-28 Southeastern Conference victory over Bell 
Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 28-28, and 10 seconds left, Hughes grabbed the ball from 
the grasp of Bell quarterback Gus Valenzuela just as he was about to release a 
pass. Hughes ran into the end zone as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Or did it? Six seconds still showed on the scoreboard, but referees called the 
game after deciding the timekeeper had stopped the clock prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hit the ball and it fell into my hands," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell had rallied from a 15-0 halftime deficit to tie the score, 28-28, on a 
63-yard pass from Gus Valenzuela to Dickey Purcell with 1:20 left. On the 
extra-point attempt, however, Fremont's Dalonte Walker broke through the line 
to block Gary Herrera's kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont drove from its 30-yard line to the Bell 40, but Fred Hernandez 
intercepted a pass by Pathfinder quarterback Robert Loera at the 11-yard line 
with 22 seconds left to give Bell one more chance to pull out the victory. But 
three plays later Hughes came up with the game-winning interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew something was going to happen," Loera said. "I knew the defense was 
going to pull through for us. That's what holds us together."  
</P>
<P>
 Loera completed 10 of 20 passes for 197 yards and three touchdowns and Walker 
rushed for 44 yards in 15 carries for Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell rolled up plenty of offense of its own. Valenzuela completed 12 of 24 
passes for 232 yards and two touchdowns and Vern Bernard had 129 yards in 12 
carries. Purcell had four catches for 128 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was back and forth all night and you hate to see a team lose," Bell Coach 
Henry Santiago said. "I kind of wished the kids had a chance to win it on the 
field."  
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 22-15, early in the fourth quarter, Bell pulled even with the 
defending City Section 3-A champions on a 33-yard touchdown run by Bernard. 
Fremont went back ahead, 28-22, on a 21-yard pass from Loera to Michael Adams 
with 6:58 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Scott boosted the Pathfinders to a 15-0 second-quarter lead, hauling 
in a 47-yard pass from Loera in the first quarter and scrambling down the 
sideline for a 46-yard touchdown reception a minute into the second quarter. 
Both scores were set up by fumble recoveries, by Steve Barragan and Simon 
Arredondo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell finally got on the scoreboard with five minutes left in the third quarter 
on a 15-yard pass from Valenzuela to Herrera. The Eagles tied the score, 15-15, 
on its next series when Valenuzela connected with Purcell on a 44-yard 
touchdown pass up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead was short-lived. Loera put the Pathfinders up, 22-15, on a 47-yard 
touchdown pass in the final minute of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week: Locke at Fremont; Bell at Jefferson.

STRIVING TO GET AHEAD; SALESIAN HIGH'S CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM HAS A LITTLE ROOM FOR 
IMPROVEMENT: 1ST OR 2ND PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way the Salesian High cross-country team sees it, there are only two ways 
to improve on its performance over last year in the Division IV State meet in 
Fresno: Second place or first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know our team can improve," junior David Moreno said. "When we go to 
races, everybody is looking out for you and there are a lot of expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be any different for the six-time defending Santa Fe League champion 
Mustangs, who took third in last year's State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in the 1960s by Brother Tom Keegan, Salesian's cross-country program 
has won three Southern Section titles and finished second four times over the 
last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Making it to the State meet, though, had been an elusive endeavor until last 
season, when the Mustangs qualified as the fourth and final team in the 
Southern Section finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Salesian, however, which had placed fourth in its only other appearance in the 
State meet in 1987, exceeded all expectations by finishing third. The Mustangs 
entered the meet as the No. 10 team in the State Division IV rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Eduardo Santillan, Salesian's top runner at the State meet in 24th 
place, returns this season. Santillan finished ninth in the Southern Section 
championships, running 16 minutes, 41 seconds on the three-mile course at Mt. 
San Antonio College. However, the Mustangs lost their second-, third- and 
fourth-best runners to graduation.  
</P>
<P>
 This season, the coaching staff is pinning its hopes on freshmen Marcos 
Aguirre and Andy Cortez. The duo will be complemented by senior Moises Flores, 
and sophomores Marco Ochoa and Javier Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a strong team and I believed we were going to the State meet last 
year," Flores said. "This year, we're also capable of going up north again if 
we take care of things. We will have more motivation to uphold our tradition 
and it will be a big challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Salesian, which recently returned from a summer running camp in Mammoth Lakes, 
won't have to wait until November to test its strength among the state's best. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the Mustangs will compete in the Stanford, San Luis Obispo and Mt. 
San Antonio College invitationals. The Mustangs also will be competing in a 
revamped Santa Fe League that includes traditional small-school powers 
Bell-Jeff of Burbank and La Salle of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be a rebuilding year from the people we actually lost," 
said Salesian co-Coach Mark Johnson, who coaches the team along with Frank 
Garcia. "It won't be as easy as last year. But with two freshmen coming in, we 
can equal last year's effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Other teams to watch: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Bell -- The Eagles were fifth in last year's City meet, but could be a team 
of the future. Junior Eduardo Trujillo, who ran 4:43.49 for 1,600 meters, and 
sophomores Rodolfo Toro and Sergio Cruz lead the team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bell Gardens -- The Lancers, who placed seventh in the Southern Section 
Division I finals, are seeking their sixth consecutive league title. Senior 
Carlos Diaz, who was second in the Almont League finals last fall, and junior 
Jose Lopez also return. 
</P>
<P>
 * Belmont -- The Sentinels won their 10th City title in 14 years last season. 
Juan Olivas, a returning senior, ran 16:11 on the three-mile course at Pierce 
College, good enough for 11th place in the City final. Senior Marco Vidrio and 
sophomore Manuel Lopez were also members of the City champion team. Sophomores 
Eduardo Derbyshire and Rene Garcia are first-year runners but are expected to 
be among Belmont's top seven. 
</P>
<P>
 * Garfield -- The Bulldogs have one of the deepest teams in the Southeastern 
Conference. Richard Martinez was sixth in the City championship meet at Pierce 
College in 15:45 for the fourth-place Bulldogs. During track, the senior placed 
fourth in the 3,200 meters and missed qualifying for the state meet by less 
than a second, running 9:42.92. Seniors Junior Camacho, Jesus Mata and Armando 
Morales could finish among the top 15 runners at the conference meet. Girls 
</P>
<P>
 * Bell Gardens -- Junior Elsa Arrellano and sophomore Cindy Lopez helped Bell 
Gardens to a share of its fifth consecutive league title. They could be a team 
of the future with sophomore Elena Toscano and freshmen Jackie Medrano and 
Erica Ferrer expected to be among the Lancers' top five. 
</P>
<P>
 * Belmont -- Won an unprecedented fifth consecutive City title last season and 
were ninth in the State Division I final. Leydi Gutierrez was the section's top 
10th-grader in last year's City final, placing ninth in 20:11. Seniors Delfina 
Martinez and Patty Chavez also return. Seniors Irma Parada and Sandra 
Castellanos and sophomore Maritza Hernandez are the top newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Garfield -- The Bulldogs missed qualifying for the State meet by six points, 
placing third in the 1993 City championships, but could surprise Belmont and 
Huntington Park for the City title this fall. Aida Rochin was a state meet 
qualifier in the 1,600, running 5:22.7, in her first year of track as a junior. 
Senior Elvira Perez is also back.  
</P>
<P>
 * Huntington Park -- The Spartans placed second at last year's City meet and 
could challenge Belmont this season. Senior Lourdes Menchaca was a City 
finalist at 1,600 meters and 3,200 meters in track. Juniors Gaby Gonzalez and 
Estrella Ojeda and sophomore Maggie Gonzalez also return. Senior Maricela 
Falcon and freshman Angie Ramirez are first-year runners.

FOOTBALL; ELLISON, LOYOLA GET A WHOLE LOT OUT OF A HALF IN WIN AT CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After being nearly unstoppable in scoring three touchdowns and gaining 115 
yards in the first half, Loyola High running back Mike Ellison did not gain a 
yard in the second half of the Cubs' 34-7 victory over Canyon in a Southern 
Section nonconference game Friday night at Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Ellison, a 5-foot-11 senior, was given the second half off by 
Loyola Coach Steve Grady to allow the Cubs' younger players to get some playing 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a great opportunity tonight to get guys who were a little bit behind 
our first string some plays," said Grady, whose team improved to 2-0 after 
defeating Fountain Valley, 21-7, last week. "We played fairly well in that our 
offense did some good things and our defense also did well." 
</P>
<P>
 In 13 carries, Ellison scored on touchdown runs of 51, two and two, to lead 
Loyola to a commanding 20-0 halftime lead before Grady called off the attack 
against an overmatched Canyon team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I'm surprised that we were able to play like this against Canyon," Grady 
said. "We just outmanned Canyon. I never thought that it would be like this." 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, (Ellison) really didn't play that much for us," Grady also said. 
"But, he runs real tough and is getting better every week." 
</P>
<P>
 First-year Coach Larry Mohr, who replaced legendary Canyon Coach Harry Welch, 
had little success against a stingy Loyola defense as the Cowboys gained only 
63 yards in the first half. Last week Canyon (0-2) lost to Righetti, 37-22. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (2-0) entered the game as The Times' seventh-ranked team in the 
Southland and showed Canyon why from the start.  
</P>
<P>
 With Ellison controlling the ground attack, Loyola quarterback Kyle 
Spielbuhler was able to complete eight of 12 passes for 95 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 On defense, the Cubs recovered two fumbles and had an interception by Patrick 
Klein as they held Canyon scoreless until the final minutes of the game, when 
the Cowboys scored on a fourth-down, five-yard pass play from Brian Bialas to 
Brian Connelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup quarterback Scott Walter played in the second half and completed a 
22-yard touchdown pass to Matt Peterson before backup tailback Michael Vanis 
completed the Cubs' scoring with an eight-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week: Loyola at Saugus.

 Los Alamitos 38, Washington 7--Junior Dennis Northcutt returned the opening

 The Griffins, The Times' No. 1-ranked Orange County team, overwhelmed the 
Generals with a rushing attack led by senior running back Phil Cruz, who had 18

 St. Paul 30, Garfield 6--St. Paul heeded Coach Marijon Ancich's pregame 
warning to play hard to overcome Garfield's size and speed in a rare City 
Section-Southern Section match. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Ancich's 20th victory against City teams in 21 games and the veteran 
coach's 263rd career win. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancich saw running back Elton Gabourel as the key: "We'll see if he can keep 
up with these guys." Gabourel kept up, rushing for 79 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield posted 127 yards of total offense, but its defense was strong despite 
the lopsided loss, allowing only 172 total yards.  
</P>
<P>
 Garfield's score came with less than three minutes left in the game, when 
backup quarterback Sal Limon connected with Rudy Burruel for a 13-yard 
touchdown pass.

ARTISTS TURN TALENTS TO RESTORATION PROJECT; CULTURE: GROUP IS TURNING HISTORIC 
BUT RUN-DOWN CEDAR AVENUE COMPLEX INTO A HEADQUARTERS. ONE BUILDING, THE 
MEMORIAL HALL, WILL REOPEN SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the last six months, an organization that supports Antelope Valley artists 
and sculptors has been wrestling with more mundane matters, such as leaky 
roofs, cracked kitchen tiles and outdated wiring. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old Antelope Valley Allied Arts Assn. took on these challenges 
last spring when it moved into its new home, the historic Cedar Avenue complex 
in downtown Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 When the group purchased the complex, its members knew the five buildings, 
dating back to the 1920s and 1930s, might need hundreds of thousands of dollars 
worth of renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Extensive repair work still needs to be done, but the association celebrated a 
first milestone in the rebirth of the Cedar Avenue complex Saturday with the 
reopening of one building, the Memorial Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing what they've done here," said Betty Midkiff, an association 
board member. "It's been a labor of love for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of volunteers, including retired construction workers, have toiled 
since spring to spruce up the hall, a once-popular Lancaster meeting room that 
had fallen into disrepair. The volunteers have repainted the walls and scrubbed 
the floors and counters, preparing the hall to be rented out for banquets, 
receptions and other special events. 
</P>
<P>
 The reopening of the hall also kicked off "Celebration of the Arts '94," a 
series of fine arts and performing arts events taking place through Oct. 10 at 
locations throughout the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At the refurbished Memorial Hall, the 155-member Allied Arts Assn. will move 
one step closer to its goal of setting up a community arts center in a complex 
that narrowly avoided demolition twice during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings at the corner of Cedar Avenue and Lancaster Boulevard once 
housed county government offices for the area, including a sheriff's station, 
jail, health center and courtroom. Architectural experts described the design 
as "restrained Art Deco." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Lancaster bought the complex from the county in 1987 and 
considered demolishing it on two occasions to make way for modern office 
buildings. City officials insisted that it would be far too expensive to 
renovate the aging complex. 
</P>
<P>
 But local preservationist successfully blocked the demolition proposals, 
arguing that the buildings were architecturally and historically significant. 
As a result of their efforts, the buildings were designated state and national 
historic sites. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Allied Arts Assn., which had been seeking a permanent 
home, turned its attention to the Cedar Avenue complex. For years, the 
association has been forced to meet in school cafeterias and set up its annual 
art show at the local fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Association members concluded that the Cedar Avenue buildings could provide 
permanent office and exhibit space, along with rooms for art classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, the Lancaster City Council agreed to sell the Cedar Avenue 
complex to the arts group for $249,000. The group was not required to make a 
down payment, but must pay the city $1,119 a month for 40 years to erase the 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony last April, city officials handed over the keys to the complex. 
Since then, members of the arts group have been busy making the old buildings 
habitable once again. To help pay the bills, the organization had hoped to be 
renting office space in the complex by now. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been difficult to do that, members said, because the old heating 
and air-conditioning systems do not work or are highly inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's slowed up the process of renting it," said Carole Love, president of 
the association. "And the donations have been coming in slower than 
anticipated, so we're kind of in the struggling stage." 
</P>
<P>
 On a positive note, however, Love said a local women's organization is 
considering renting one of the Cedar Avenue buildings. In addition, the arts 
group hopes to acquire surplus air conditioning and heating equipment soon from 
a county agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Memorial Hall is repaired, Love is optimistic that the remaining 
buildings can be renovated quickly. She hope the remaining space will be rented 
out or used for art exhibits and classes by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainly," Love said, "it's just a matter of paint and polish now for the rest 
of the complex.

SPECIAL LOW-DOWN REPORT; 25 WAYS TO TURN $10,000 INTO A HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRADLEY INMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most daunting obstacles facing Southland home buyers has been the 
hefty down payment. But that's changing. The traditional 20% down formula is 
giving way to plethora of private and government programs that ease the down 
payment shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Five percent, 3% and even nothing-down loans are becoming the alternative for 
many buyers as private industry and government team up to help more people into 
homeownership. As a result, with a little luck, some patience and one of the 
programs described below, it's now possible to get into a first home for 
$10,000 down. 
</P>
<P>
 And the $10,000 might be easier to raise than you thought. See the 
accompanying story on page K5 for some tips on how to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the low-down programs are old-time favorites such as FHA and VA, as well 
as a raft of new programs, such as the city of Santa Ana mortgage for high 
school grads who earn a four-year college degree and return home to buy a 
house. And both the state of California and a big stock brokerage are offering 
separate programs that link a parents' assets to a nothing-down program for 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Other programs are targeted at veterans, public employees or buyers who are 
willing to purchase homes in distressed neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 City of Los Angeles homeownership specialist Linda Buckspan points out that 
borrowers must fit the "narrow window" that each of these programs offers. "Not 
every program is for everyone, but together there is an opportunity for a lot 
of people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest down payments often require excellent credit; and with all of the 
loans, borrowers must meet the qualifying criteria, which often includes 
employment history, income and credit history. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective borrowers should also be patient. The low-down programs are often 
a complex combination of federal, state and local funding, which can complicate 
the underwriting process, require more scrutiny of borrowers' credit histories 
and slow the approval process. But hang in there, it can be done. Here are 25 
ways to turn $10,000 into a house: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- FHA: The Low-Down Leader 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development offers a variety of 
mortgage insurance programs through the FHA, which requires about 3% to 4% cash 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no income requirements to qualify for a FHA mortgage. Other 
advantages are that FHA loans do not contain prepayment penalties, and in some 
cases they are assumable by qualified purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
 FHA loan limits vary depending on the county where the property is located. 
Recently, the FHA loan limit was increased to $151,725 for single-family homes, 
but only in high-cost areas such as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 FHA does not lend money; it insures mortgages. FHA loans are made by a bank, 
savings and loan, mortgage company or other FHA-approved lender. In addition, 
FHA does not set the rates and points. The lender determines these, so it is 
best to shop around by calling several FHA-approved lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Call the Los Angeles HUD office at (213) 251-7122 for more information. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Vets Apply 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2.9 million California veterans and service personnel are eligible 
to participate in the Veterans Administration Home Loan Guarantee Program, 
which in most cases requires no down payment. VA loans can be used to buy a 
home, build a home, improve a home or to refinance an existing loan. 
</P>
<P>
 After issuing a certificate of eligibility to the vet, the VA guarantees the 
loan to the lender up to $184,000. 
</P>
<P>
 VA loans frequently offer lower interest rates than ordinarily available with 
other kinds of loans. To qualify for a loan, the first step is to complete a 
Certificate of Eligibility (Form 26-1880). Call (800) 827-1000 for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- More Help for California Vets 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans also can find financing through the state Cal-Vet home loan program, 
which offers low- or no-down payment mortgages, a low interest rate and no loan 
origination fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum loan amount for single-family homes in Los Angeles County is 
$198,700; $220,400 in Orange County and $203,800 in most other Southland 
counties. For more information, contact Cal-Vet at (800) 952-5626. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- No Down for Government Workers 
</P>
<P>
 The CalPERS Member Home Loan program is offered by the California Public 
Employees Retirement System (PERS), which invests pension funds for state and 
local government employees. PERS offers a standard 5% down program and a 
no-down option for members who currently work for the government and meet other 
qualifying criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 To get 100% financing, members must take out a personal loan for 5% of the 
purchase price or the appraised value, whatever is less. This is a personal 
loan, secured by the member's retirement contributions, and must be paid back. 
These funds are used to reduce the down payment to zero. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call Lomas Mortgage, which services the loans, and can 
be reached at (800) 874-PERS. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- 3% Down for First-Time (and Other) Home Buyers 
</P>
<P>
 The state-sanctioned California Housing Loan Insurance Fund is offering 97% 
loans, which are originated by private lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan program is a partnership between the California Housing Loan 
Insurance Fund, Commonwealth Mortgage Assurance Corp., Federal National 
Mortgage Assn. and several California mortgage bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers do not have to be first-time home buyers; however, they cannot own 
any other real estate when they apply for the loan. The maximum loan amount is 
$203,150. For a list of participating lenders, call (800) 789-2432 and ask for 
information on the 97% loan. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- L.A. County Pays Costs 
</P>
<P>
 The County of Los Angeles Homeowner's Assistance Program offers low-down loans 
to home buyers who purchase houses in 62 targeted neighborhoods that the county 
wants to stabilize and increase homeownership rates. Therefore, some of the 
communities are high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical down payment is 5%, but the county pays 1.5 points to the borrower 
to cover loan costs such as points and fees. (A "point" is 1% of the loan 
amount.) The current interest rate is 7.67% for a 30-year fixed loan and there 
are other qualifying criteria. For more information, call (213) 260-2204. 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- Orange County Offsets Fees 
</P>
<P>
 Through its Fee Assistance Program, Orange County will pay up to 1.5% of loan 
fees for borrowers who tap a joint Los Angeles and Orange County homeowner 
fund, which offers low down payment loans. Borrowers can earn no more than 
$47,040 and the price of the home can not exceed $242,190 for a new home and 
$225,900 for a resale. Also, the home buyer must agree to live in the home for 
two years, and the house must be located in Orange County cities that are 
participating in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call (714) 834-5693. 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- Attn: Santa Ana High School Grads 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Santa Ana offers special programs for graduating high school 
students who go on to graduate from college and return to Santa Ana to buy a 
home. Eligible students must first apply after graduating from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 In the form of a loan, the city will provide up to 15% of the loan value but 
no more than $30,000 for the down payment. Payments on the city loan are 
deferred for five years. After that, the amount is amortized over the next 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 If the owner stays in the home for 10 full years, half of the loan is 
forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the program is to encourage Santa Ana residents to return to 
the community after college. It is hoped that their presence will stabilize the 
homeownership rate and that the graduates will serve as role models for younger 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call (714) 667-2224. 
</P>
<P>
 9 -- Private Low-Down Loans Without PMI 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of private lenders are loosening up their requirements for 
low-down loans. For example, Home Savings offers its new Easy Start 95% loan 
that doesn't require private mortgage insurance (PMI) and permits borrowers to 
tap a generous relative or parent who is willing to gift the 5% down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Both move-up buyers and first-time buyers can take advantage of this 
adjustable-rate loan. As much as $300,000 can be borrowed for as long as 40 
years. Also, Home Savings permits the seller to pay 100% of the closing costs. 
For more information, call (800) 652-8833. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanwa Bank California is offering a low-down payment loan as low as 5% with 3% 
cash and a 2% gift. The loan can be made without PMI. Plus, points and closing 
costs are reduced. For more information, call (800) 237-2692. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other large financial institutions are offering similar loans. 
</P>
<P>
 10 -- L.A.'s Silent Seconds 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles' Silent Second Program, which offers a 5% down loan, 
also provides secondary mortgage assistance to home buyers whose income is 
under $54,240. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers can receive up to $30,000 for a second-trust deed paid for by the 
city, which helps people afford a home that they might otherwise not qualify 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, home buyers who put down 5%, or $6,500, on a $130,000 house could 
qualify for as much as $30,000 from a city-sponsored second-trust deed fund. 
Authorized private lenders determine how much the second-trust deed will be. 
</P>
<P>
 The silent second need not be repaid until the title changes. 
</P>
<P>
 This program is available only for newly constructed homes in South-Central 
and East Los Angeles that are designated by the city under this program. Down 
payments can consist of 3% of the borrower's own money along with 2% from a 
family member. Generally, people must earn at least $30,000 annually to qualify 
for this program. 
</P>
<P>
 Call (800) 994-4444 or (213) 847-7631 for more information. 
</P>
<P>
 11 -- City Helps With Existing Homes 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles residents who meet specific income and home-price guidelines can 
obtain a low 7.34% 30-year fixed interest rate mortgage with a minimum 5% down 
to buy a home anywhere in Los Angeles. The program is called the Existing Home 
Purchase Program. Generally, people must earn at least $30,000 annually to 
qualify for this program. Call (800) 994-4444 or (213) 847-7631 for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 12 -- New In-Fill Projects Offer Low-Down Possibilities 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles' Small Sites Program offers 3% down payment loans on 
specific city-sponsored developments in the South Central area of Los Angeles. 
Currently there are 10 homes available. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call (800) 994-4444 or (310) 548-2904. 
</P>
<P>
 13 -- Home Works 
</P>
<P>
 In cooperation with the city of Los Angeles, the secondary-market lender 
Freddie Mac recently announced its Home Works program, which, with the city, 
provides 95% financing for eligible first-time home buyers. Three percent of 
the down payment must come from the borrowers' own funds with the remainder 
from city grants, gifts from relatives and/or loans from a nonprofit, 
government agency or employer. Borrowers are also required to take home-buying 
education courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans are available through private lenders. For more information, contact 
one of the three participating lenders: Countrywide Funding, (310) 440-3160, 
Family Savings Bank, (818) 794-1151 or First Interstate Bank, (818) 500-3708. 
</P>
<P>
 14 -- Starting With BEGIN 
</P>
<P>
 BEGIN is a small program that provides down payment funds for low-income 
buyers who want to purchase new homes in designated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers may be loaned up to $20,000 in the form of a second deed of trust, 
which must be paid back when the home is sold. Assisted households must have an 
income that does not exceed 80% of the area's median income. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of $1 million will be available in Los Angeles to assist 50 first-time 
home buyers in two projects. The first is a development of 114 detached 
single-family homes in South-Central L.A. BEGIN will assist 14 families in this 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The second project is a small-sites program initiated after the 1992 civil 
unrest. This program provides funding for small developers to construct 
single-family homes for large families on vacant land in neighborhoods needing 
revitalization. Plans are to assist 36 families with this in-fill program. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the California Department of Housing and Community 
Development at (916) 322-0356. 
</P>
<P>
 15 -- Parent Power 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch's Parent Power Program helps home buyers who have sufficient 
income to qualify for a Merrill Lynch mortgage but who lack a cash down 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
 However, their parents must also be willing to help. 
</P>
<P>
 If the buyer's mother or father has a stock brokerage account with Merrill 
Lynch, they can use it as collateral (in place of the down payment) without 
actually taking the money out of the account. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, funds in the account still gain interest and dividends, said Bobbie 
Collins, a spokeswoman for Merrill Lynch, New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a person needing a $20,000 down payment for a $100,000 home could 
obtain a mortgage loan for the full $100,000 while using the Parent Power 
Program in place of the standard 20% down payment. The program is available 
with 15- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the program, contact a local Merrill Lynch consultant 
or call (800) 854-7154, Ext. 8667. 
</P>
<P>
 16 -- Parents' Equity 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the summer, California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) through 
North American Mortgage Co. in Santa Rosa is also expected to offer an Equity 
Link loan. The mortgage lets the home buyer get into a home for nothing down, 
but the parents of the borrower must pledge 10% of the purchase price in the 
form of a second-trust deed on their house or in the form of eligible 
investment securities. The pledge is removed after seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call North American at (800) 700-6262. 
</P>
<P>
 17 -- The 3% Move-In Package 
</P>
<P>
 Builders are also touting new low-down programs. For example, Los 
Angeles-based Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. is offering a 3% move-in package that 
promises to get buyers into one of the builder's homes for only 3%, which 
covers down payment, closing costs and all fees. The program is available in 
most of K&B's subdivisions and selected lots in these communities. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the builder at (800) 344-6637. 
</P>
<P>
 18 -- State Earthquake Relief 
</P>
<P>
 The California Housing Finance Agency's Renter to Home Buyer Program is 
offering one of the lowest interest rates around -- 5.95% for a 30-year 
fixed-rate loan -- for renters whose apartments suffered damage from the 
Northridge earthquake. The required down payment is only 3%. Eligible renters 
must show proof that their apartments were damaged or destroyed by the 
earthquake, aftershocks or fires from the quake. For more information, call 
CHFA at (916) 322-0249. 
</P>
<P>
 19 -- Fannie Mae Promises Help 
</P>
<P>
 Fannie Mae's Community Home Buyers Program allows first-time buyers with 
little cash to obtain 95% financing. Also, participants may put down as little 
as 3% of their own money, with the remainder permitted in the form of a gift 
from family members, a government program or nonprofit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage insurance is required on all loans above 80% loan-to-value ratio when 
borrowers do not use their own funds for at least 5% down. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Federal National Mortgage Assn., commonly referred to as 
Fannie Mae, the Community Home Buyers program is administered through 
participating lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The income limit in California is currently 120% of the median income for the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers must attend a seminar on home ownership and the home-buying process. 
For a list of participating lenders, call Fannie Mae at (800) 732-6643. 
</P>
<P>
 20 -- More Fannie Aid in Inner City 
</P>
<P>
 From Fannie Mae, home buyers in central cities can also take advantage of the 
FannieNeighbors Program. This mortgage plan was created to increase 
homeownership and promote revitalization in central cities as well as low- and 
moderate-income minority areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Using FannieNeighbors, borrowers need less income to qualify for a mortgage 
and less cash for closing than with standard mortgages. The program includes 
mortgages to buy or refinance a home. 
</P>
<P>
 FannieNeighbors has no income limit for residents who are purchasing a home 
within designated central cities (if not the largest city in a metropolitan 
area, cities must have populations of 250,000 or more.) 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers must attend a seminar on home ownership and the home-buying process. 
</P>
<P>
 For a list of participating lenders, call Fannie Mae at (800) 732-6643. 
</P>
<P>
 21 -- HUD Repo Means Low Down 
</P>
<P>
 Cash-strapped home buyers who are looking for a bargain can sometimes find HUD 
foreclosure properties for as little as $100 down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development acquires properties from 
lenders who foreclose on mortgages insured by HUD. These properties are 
available for sale to both home owner-occupants and investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Down payments vary depending on whether the property is eligible for FHA 
insurance. If not, payments range from 5% to 20%. But when the property is 
FHA-insured, HUD sources say a condo can be purchased for as little as $100 
upfront. 
</P>
<P>
 Each offer must be accompanied by an "earnest money" deposit equal to 5% of 
the bid price, not to exceed $2,000, but not less than $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers should be aware that foreclosure properties are sold "as is," meaning 
limited repairs have been made but no structural or mechanical warranties are 
implied. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in buying a HUD home can obtain current property sales 
listings through a licensed broker. HUD will pay the broker's commission, if 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call HUD's Los Angeles office at (213) 252-7901. 
</P>
<P>
 22 -- VA Foreclosures Are Well-Kept Secret 
</P>
<P>
 Homes can be purchased directly from the Veterans Administration, often well 
below market value and with a down payment amount as low as 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The VA doesn't make direct loans; it guarantees loans," said Richard Grimes, 
of the property management section of the VA's Loan Guarantee Division In 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a vet defaults -- and we don't talk about that much because we are the VA 
-- in most cases where there's a foreclosure, the VA will end up owning the 
property," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Down payments vary, ranging from 2% to 3% for owner-occupants. Investors may 
be required to pay up to 10% down. Conventional financing is acceptable. The VA 
also offers the public (not just veterans in this case) seller-financing with a 
fixed 30-year loan at 8.5% interest, Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in purchasing a VA foreclosure may call (800) 827-1000 to 
request a current listing. About 100 new properties are listed every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential buyers then should contact a real estate broker of their choice. The 
broker will prepare and submit a bid to the VA. 
</P>
<P>
 23 -- A Gem for 'Diamonds-in-the-Rough' 
</P>
<P>
 Home buyers who want the money to buy a fixer-upper along with a 
home-improvement loan can turn to HUD's Rehabilitation Loan Program, Section 
203 (k). 
</P>
<P>
 The program is designed to facilitate major structural rehabilitation of 
houses with one to four units that are more than one year old. Condominiums are 
not eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 A 203 (k) loan is usually done as a combination loan to purchase a fixer-upper 
property "as is" and rehabilitate it, or to refinance a temporary loan to buy 
the property and do the rehabilitation. It can also be done as a 
rehabilitation-only loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors must put 15% down, while owner-occupants are required to come up 
with only 3% to 5%. HUD requires that a minimum of $5,000 be spent on 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Two appraisals are required. Plans and specifications for the proposed work 
must be submitted for architectural review and cost estimation. Mortgage 
proceeds are advanced periodically during the rehabilitation period to finance 
the construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only select lenders are participating. For a list, call HUD's Los Angeles 
office at (213) 252-7901. 
</P>
<P>
 24 -- Help for Victims of Earthquakes, Other Disasters 
</P>
<P>
 People whose residences were destroyed or severely damaged in a disaster can 
receive 100% financing assistance through HUD's (203h) mortgage insurance 
program. Borrowers must be able to prove their previous residence was in the 
disaster area and that reconstruction or replacement is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 No down payment is required, although some expenses must be paid by the 
borrower in cash. The maximum mortgage amount is $203,150. 
</P>
<P>
 Both owners and renters of affected residences can participate in the program. 
However, only single-family detached homes are covered. Condominiums, duplexes 
and multifamily homes are not eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 The residence purchased need not be located in the same area as where the 
disaster occurred. Applications are due within one year of the President's 
declaration of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call HUD's Los Angeles office at (213) 252-7901. 
</P>
<P>
 25 -- Long Beach Offers Help 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Long Beach offers help on down payments through a city-sanctioned 
nonprofit group called the Long Beach Housing Development Company. 
</P>
<P>
 Available citywide, the program pays 40% of the down payment for households 
that earn 100% of the area median income -- about $58,000 for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
 A grant deed is recorded but the "conditional grant" is forgiven if the 
homeowner stays in the home at least 10 years. Call (310) 570-6926 for more 
information. 
</P>

HOT PROPERTY: HE'S TAKEN HIS ACT TO ENGLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar-winning actor RICHARD DREYFUSS, who co-stars with John Lithgow in the 
upcoming mystery movie "Silent Fall," has put his Hollywood Hills home of 10 
years on the market at just under $2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreyfuss, who just finished filming the drama "Mr. Holland's Opus" with Jay 
Thomas and Olympia Dukakis, is in England, getting ready to make his 
directorial debut with the opening Sept. 29 of "Hamlet" at the Old Rep Theatre 
in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 He listed his house because he is said to be ready for a change. He would 
prefer to lease out the house for a year or two, at $15,000 a month, but is 
prepared to sell it, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreyfuss, who is 46 and recently divorced, still holds the record as the 
youngest man ever to receive the Academy Award for Best Actor. He won it at age 
29 for his performance in Neil Simon's "The Goodbye Girl," and also starred in 
such films as "Jaws," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "Down and Out in 
Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 His mountaintop home, in Nichols Canyon, has sweeping views of the city from 
almost every room and balcony. Built in 1973, it was later enlarged and 
remodeled for Dreyfuss, his wife and their two children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mediterranean-style residence, which is nearly 10,000 square feet in size, 
has a master suite with a fireplace; three additional bedroom suites, a 
two-story, walk-in closet; two-bedroom staff apartment, three laundries, seven 
fireplaces and a pool with a view. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a separate building with a library, guest suite and gym. The gated 
home, which also has a motor court and fountain surrounded by gardens, is 
listed with Jo Wilder of Jon Douglas Co., Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wheel of Fortune" letter-turner VANNA WHITE, has sold her former home in the 
Hollywood Hills to her tenant, Germany-born aerospace industrialist Christoph 
Tribull, for about $1.5 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 White and her husband, restaurateur George Santa Pietro, moved in 1991 when 
they bought a newly built, $3-million home nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribull bought the house "because it has a stunning ocean view and a nice 
pool," he said. The 5,300-square-foot house was built about 30 years ago, but 
was totally refurbished in the late 1980s, when White purchased it for $1.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribull has been in this country for about 10 years but travels back and forth 
on business to Germany, where he also has a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Former L.A. Kings player LUC ROBITAILLE, who was traded at the end of July to 
the Pittsburgh Penguins, and his wife, STACY, have sold their Hidden Hills home 
for $925,000, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The asking price was $985,000. The 14-day escrow closed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Robitaille, 28, joined the Kings in 1986 and last year became the first left 
winger in the history of the National Hockey League to score 63 goals in a 
single season. He was one of the Kings' most popular players. 
</P>
<P>
 He sold his one-story, ranch-style house on an acre with a lagoon, pool and 
horse facilities to Beverly Hills gynecologist Dr. Peter Weiss and his wife, 
Pam, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which has an open floor plan and about 4,300 square feet, has a spa 
off of the master suite. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Tyoran and Andrea Jacobs of Jon Douglas Co.'s Westlake Village office 
represented the Weisses, and Barbara Lipkin of Fred Sands' Woodland Hills 
office represented the Robitailles. 
</P>
<P>
 A Holmby Hills home owned during the 1960s by singer ANDY WILLIAMS, when he 
was married to actress Claudine Longet, has been sold for $4.7 million, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Mazur, a 1980s real estate whiz who pleaded guilty last December to 
tax and bankruptcy fraud after engineering what prosecutors alleged was one of 
the biggest tax fraud cases in years, owned the home until recently, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The house was sold through bankruptcy court. The most recent asking price was 
$5.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1928, the home has six bedrooms and a guest house with a kitchen in 
11,500 square feet. Shirley Wells had the listing with John Aaroe & Associates 
of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bel-Air mansion that gangster LUCKY LUCIANO is said to have leased during 
the late 1930s and that actors Eddie Murphy and Richard Harris rented in more 
recent years is no longer for sale, its new owner says. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills stockbroker Joseph Arsenault, 35, bought the house in May for 
$3.7 million, then listed it for awhile at $4.95 million, documents show.

EXPO OFFERS TIPS ON CITY, COUNTY LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about housing affordability in their communities, a number of city 
and county agencies are offering buyers help with their first homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Two special workshops on local government loan programs are planned at the Los 
Angeles Times' Low-Down Home Loan Expo to be held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Saturday at the Burbank Hilton Convention Center, 2500 Hollywood Way, Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Los Angeles County's Homeowner's Assistance Program offers 
low-down loans to home buyers who purchase houses in 62 targeted neighborhoods 
that the county wants to stabilize and increase the homeownership rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County will pay up to 1.5% of loan fees for borrowers who tap a joint 
L.A. and Orange County homeowner fund, which offers low-down payment loans. 
</P>
<P>
 And Los Angeles city residents who meet specific income and home-price 
guidelines can obtain a 7.34%, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a minimum 5% 
down to buy a home anywhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Private lenders and state and federal officials will be on hand to explain 
their low-down programs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 To get more details about the expo, call TimesLine at 808-8463 and press star 
9420, or see the ad on K10.

BOOK REVIEW; REALTY NEGOTIATION TACTICS MADE CLEAR; "SUCCESSFUL REAL ESTATE 
NEGOTIATION, REVISED EDITION" BY PETER G. MILLER AND DOUGLAS M. BREGMAN (HARPER 
PERENNIAL, NEW YORK, 1994: $13, 240 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiation is critical to real estate success for buyers, sellers and their 
realty agents. However, except for this book, there is virtually no source to 
obtain information on realty negotiation tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors have created an easy-to-understand book that applies negotiation 
strategies to everyday real estate situations. The book is filled with examples 
of the negotiation tactics being explained. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the book is not just about negotiation tactics. It's also filled with 
practical real estate strategies. For example, the authors explain why the 
issue of a home's physical condition is so important when negotiating the sales 
price and terms. Miller and Bregman share profitable home fix-up tips that not 
only add value to the home but also strengthen the seller's negotiation 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter topics include How the Negotiation System Really Works; Real Estate as 
a Package Deal; What Is a Contract; Customizing Forms: The Use of Addenda and 
Contingencies; Three Important Ideas for Real Estate Negotiators; The Wide 
World of Warranties; Easements, Covenants and Conditions; Pricing and Down 
Payments; Appraisals and Value; Co-Signers; Deeds; Termites; Deposits; 
Environmental Issues; Fixtures: What Stays and What Goes; Occupancy Agreements; 
Damages and Rescission, and Creating a Back-Up Contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Who should read this book? Just three categories of real estate people: 
buyers, sellers and real estate agents. This would make a great textbook for a 
mini-course on real estate negotiation because it is so complete. But it should 
also be required reading for home buyers and sellers before they make a 
purchase offer so they understand how the negotiation process really works. On 
my scale of one to 10, this book rates a solid gold 10.

MORE PEOPLE PAY CASH FOR HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While most people still stretch their finances to the limit to qualify for a 
mortgage, an increasing number of Southland home buyers are paying cash for 
their new residences, a real estate information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 6,165 residential purchases were made with no financing during the 
second quarter, 10.5% of the region's 58,723 home sales, according to La Jolla- 
based Dataquick Information Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage was up from 9.5% for second quarter, 1993.

YOUR MORTGAGE; COMPUTERIZED LOAN SYSTEMS SAVE MONEY, TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The future shape of American home mortgage lending was put on display here for 
the first time last week and the odds are strong that once you've seen, shopped 
and applied for a mortgage using a multi-lender computerized loan origination 
(CLO) system, you'll never want to go back to the past. Or to the present. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, you'll probably ask yourself: Why has the process of getting a 
mortgage -- the biggest single debt I may incur in my lifetime -- been stuck in 
the Horse-and-Buggy Age for so long? 
</P>
<P>
 If technology exists that empowers me to identify and analyze dozens of 
competing loans -- and to choose the most advantageous mortgage according to my 
own financial and personal needs -- why am I flipping through the Yellow Pages 
with no idea what's best? Why am I borrowing tens or hundreds of thousands of 
dollars so blindly? 
</P>
<P>
 That was the main consumer question before mortgage industry executives and 
federal officials who gathered for a CLO technology demonstration. As the name 
suggests, CLOs are interactive electronic systems that not only display local 
and national lenders' current loan offerings and underwriting criteria, but 
actually take the consumer through the application and funding commitment 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
 CLOs enable you to sit in a realtor's, builder's or mortgage broker's office 
and shop the market with a precision you've never experienced before. Rather 
than getting truth-in-lending good faith estimates on finance charges and 
closing costs days after you've applied for a specific loan, a CLO system 
enables you to see everything on your settlement sheet for every loan you're 
considering. If you spot junk fees or unusually large charges from a particular 
lender, you simply don't apply. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also scroll into the future to evaluate alternative loan types or 
terms, and find out which competing mortgage today will have the lowest 
effective rate or cost at intervals you choose -- say 4 years down the road, 7 
years, 12, you name it. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a loan with a low rate but high points up front will give you a 
higher effective cost if you pay it off early versus a higher-rate loan with 
low points. (Each point is 1% of the loan amount, paid up front.) But in what 
year does the high-point, low-rate alternative cross the line, and become 
cheaper in terms of total interest outlays for you? The CLO supplies the 
analysis for you, loan by loan, with easy-to-understand graphics in color on a 
computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
 You can check out dozens of loans -- fixed rate, adjustables, short-term 
balloons, sub-par credit mortgages, jumbos -- depending on the particular CLO 
you use. You can also figure out which loans will allow you to buy the maximum 
amount of house for your budget, given the down payment and settlement cash you 
have on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Best yet: You don't have to wait long to be able to do all this. CLOs are 
either coming soon -- or have already arrived -- in your community. Major real 
estate brokerage, banking, and home building firms are scrambling to negotiate 
with CLO sponsors to bring their systems to their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest CLO programs, the so-called MARS system, is either fully 
operational or is at the staff training level in several dozen realty firms 
across the country, according to Matthew Broderick, executive vice president of 
GHR Systems Inc., the corporate sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital Mortgage Services' Residential Express (REX) CLO is on line at 70 
banks around the country, and will soon be offered through the realty offices 
of members of the National Assn. of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB), a trade group 
of predominantly minority realty sales firms. 
</P>
<P>
 A third large CLO -- the DIMEX (Digital Information Mortgage Exchange) -- is 
at the introductory stage with realty brokers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic 
states. Sponsored by Infotrust Inc., the DIMEX system offers borrowers national 
"wholesale" mortgage rates -- discounted by the two points or more that local 
mortgage companies would normally add to a national lender's actual rate. The 
cost of using the CLO to the borrower: No more than $400, including $150 to 
Infotrust and up to $250 to the local realty firm or builder using the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the ability to provide on-line, interactive evaluations of loan 
packages for home shoppers or borrowers, the DIMEX CLO holds out the promise of 
saving consumers thousands of dollars on loan transactions. In one recent case, 
according to Brice E. Macartney, president of Infotrust, a home buyer 
eliminated $5,400 worth of local brokerage fees by applying for a national 
lender's mortgage at the wholesale quote, not the local retail. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no turning back (on CLO technology)," said Macartney. "We now have 
the ability to deliver mortgage money more intelligently and cheaper to the 
consumer (than the traditional system.)" 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line of all this for you: CLOs are about to explode on the home 
mortgage scene. Since there are a growing number of competing systems, make 
sure you get full disclosure from the realtor or builder on the costs of using 
any particular system. Make sure, too, that the CLO you use offers multiple 
lenders -- national and local -- and warrants to you that it is "lender 
neutral." You don't want a system that steers you to a particular lender's 
products: You want to do all the steering yourself.

VALLEY HOME SALES UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 1,100 residential properties were sold in August, an increase of 14.6% 
over the same month in 1993, the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors has 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that total, single-family homes captured 972 closed escrows, for the best 
sales tally for the month since August, 1988, and a 16.7% increase over a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The median resale price of single-family homes that closed escrow last month 
was $175,000, down 10.4% from August, 1993, and 5.4% lower than the median 
reported this July, association statistics indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 8,290 properties were listed for sale on the association's 
computerized Multiple Listing Services, a drop of 34.2% from a year ago when 
12,594 properties were listed for sale. Of that total, 6,383 listings were 
single-family homes and 1,907 were condos.

CONDO Q & A: TRY MEDIATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I was recently elected to the board of directors of my condominium 
association. I am concerned that our manager does not have a fidelity bond. I 
asked to see the bank records for the operating account and the savings account 
but the other board members will not release the records. 
</P>
<P>
 My lawyer says that I will have to spend several thousand dollars of my own 
money to file an injunction to force them to disclose the records that I am 
legally entitled to see. 
</P>
<P>
 What alternative course of action would you recommend? Does the new law 
requiring arbitration apply to this type of dispute? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Didn't your attorney suggest writing a letter? Have letters been 
ineffective in the past? Sometimes even board members have to document their 
request by corresponding with the rest of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Since you are a board member, you are entitled to see the bank account 
records. However, if you are the type of person who would use this information 
to find fault with the board's fiscal policies or the manager's purchasing and 
payment methods, this may be the reason that the other board members are 
holding you off. 
</P>
<P>
 When you review the records, try to be objective. There is a difference 
between a watchful board member who is fulfilling a fiduciary duty to protect 
the association's finances and one who is nit-picking about every bill that is 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several steps that you can take prior to filing legal action. I am 
not an attorney, but in my opinion, your attorney should have discussed these 
less expensive alternatives with you. Filing an injunction should be your last 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 First, you can write a letter to all of the other board members requesting 
access to the financial records that you want to review. As a board member, you 
should have access to any and all records of the association. 
</P>
<P>
 In your letter to the board, there are certain laws that you can cite that may 
educate the board. According to California Corporations Code, Section 8334: 
"Every director shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect 
and copy all books, records and documents of every kind and to inspect the 
physical properties of the corporation of which such person is a director." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the California Civil Code, Section 1365.5, states that the board 
of directors of a community association must do all of the following: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Review a current reconciliation of the association's operating and 
reserve accounts on at least a quarterly basis and review the most recent 
statements prepared by the financial institutions where the association's 
operating and reserve funds are kept. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- On at least a quarterly basis, review the current year's actual reserve 
revenues and expenses compared to the current year's reserve budget and review 
an income and expense statement for the association's operating and reserve 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 If the association's governing documents impose more stringent accounting 
duties on the board of directors, then your board must perform their duties 
according to the governing documents. 
</P>
<P>
 After you or your attorney write a letter to the board citing all of these 
reasons why you should have access to the records, the board members will 
surely grant your request. 
</P>
<P>
 If they ignore your letter, then the next step is an attempt to mediate or 
arbitrate the dispute prior to seeking a court injunction. You do not have to 
be represented by an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one other bit of advice I would offer. The association should 
purchase fidelity bond coverage and the board should ensure that the reserve 
funds are under the control of the board members. Two directors or officers 
should sign any withdrawal from the reserve account and the amount of the 
withdrawal and the purpose should be noted in the board meeting minutes. Can 
Board of Directors Fill Board Vacancy? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I live in a homeowner association in Santa Barbara. Can the board of 
directors appoint a board member to fill a vacancy on the board? Don't all 
directors have to be elected by the membership at a meeting called for that 
purpose? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Usually, the answer to your question can be found in your association's 
bylaws. The bylaws contain information about how the board operates and when 
membership meetings are required. California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit 
Corporations Code defers to the bylaws regarding replacement of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 In most associations, the remaining board members have the authority to 
appoint a board member to fill a vacancy if the vacancy occurs because of a 
resignation. However, if the vacancy is the result of a recall vote of the 
members, then the entire membership votes on the replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Always review your association's governing documents when you have a question 
about how the association should operate.

SPEAKING OUT: THIS QUAKE-INSURANCE TALE HAS A HAPPY ENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON McKENZIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During years of paying extra premiums for earthquake insurance, my standard 
bitter joke was this would pay off if the whole house tumbled in a heap at the 
bottom of our hill. After all, with a house pegged at $416,000 on the policy 
and a 10% deductible, I would need more than $41,000 worth of damage to collect 
on penny. Or so I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 After our big shake-up on Jan. 17, I didn't bother to look around much until 
it occurred to me I could at least claim a deduction on my income tax. So I 
called my longtime insurance agent about six weeks after the quake to say I was 
going to file a claim to back up an IRS report. "Sorry to bother you when 
you're so busy," I said, "I know the deductible will eat up any damage claims I 
make." "Send it in," she said. "You never know." 
</P>
<P>
 No chimney guys would come look and give me an estimate. They wouldn't even 
answer phone calls. At last the city inspector's office sent two young guys to 
see if our house should be red-tagged. They told me the going rate for 
rebuilding chimneys was about $400 per foot, tops, and I needed at most 10 feet 
if I needed any. So four grand went into my damage estimate. The guys put a 
green tag on the house, which was handy because we were living in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the Yellow Pages I found a kindly gent who came out to look at the big 
crack in the retaining wall. He said he would fix everything for $24,000. After 
I threw in the kitchen sink, I was still way below $40,000. That'll make a 
splendid deduction on my tax, if nothing else, I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the call from the insurance company. She told me someone would be 
out to look over the damage. "Why bother," I asked her. "You won't be paying 
anything." Then came the shocker. She told me my policy covered the house and 
"appurtenant structures." Each structure was valued separately. The busted 
retaining wall was valued at $40,000, so the deductible on that was $4,000. If 
it cost $24,000 to fix, they'd pick up the tab for $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not all. 
</P>
<P>
 Their claims adjuster didn't quibble with my hasty damage estimates. He did, 
however, remove my generous charge of $6,000 for soil-and-structural 
engineering prior to rebuilding the wall. I'm not allowed to put that in, he 
said. Talk to the insurance company about it. Even without that charge, his 
damage estimate was still $24,000. "I put in a few things you overlooked," was 
his explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later the insurance company called. "Did you see the adjuster's 
statement? If the amount's OK, we'll send you a check." By now getting greedy, 
I had a couple of questions. "The retaining-wall guy said I'd need a soil 
study. That's not included." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sure the city will require that," she said. "But if it is required, 
we will pay it. Also, if other charges come up concerning the wall, we'll cover 
them too." 
</P>
<P>
 After I recovered my breath, I asked: "You seem like really nice people but 
how do I know you'll stand by that statement after I cash your check?" Her 
unfazed reply: "Would you like me to confirm it in writing? I'd be happy to 
send you a letter to that effect." The letter arrived the next day. But by now, 
I'm quite sure I don't need it. 
</P>
<P>
 You haven't heard the whole story yet. I didn't have enough damage to get 
repair money for the house but it was not for want of trying by the claims 
adjuster. He looked carefully at every room and at all the outside walls. When 
his damage report came, I saw that he had included repainting the whole outside 
of the house and nearly every wall and ceiling inside. "Hey," I said, "the 
quake didn't damage the damn paint. How come you think you should repaint?" 
</P>
<P>
 This was his explanation. The insurance company feels it cannot accurately 
match paint, even when the paint's almost new. So where there is a crack that 
might have been caused by the quake, the entire surface in that color, not just 
the repaired section, has to be repainted. Apparently it didn't matter that my 
paint was ancient and peeling. 
</P>
<P>
 I had never heard of this insurance company before my agent sold me the 
policy. I have no connection with either the company or the agent except as a 
client. 
</P>
<P>
 And I was just as scornful of insurance companies as anyone else before I had 
this experience. It just seems to me it's time that something besides a 
complaint should be said about insurance companies.

GARDENING Q & A: HOW TO GET RID OF ANT COLONIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK E. CHRISTENSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I have an ant problem red ants in my rose garden and black ants 
around my citrus and peach trees. I've tried various products, plus boiling 
water and digging up their tunnels, but nothing seems to work. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: For over 15 years we had an active nest of big red ants right in our 
front yard, and nothing seemed to slow them down. Sprays only worked for a day 
or two, then the ants were right back. But we finally had remarkable success 
with the dry Diazinon granules. It took some persistence, but this is what 
worked: 
</P>
<P>
 We sprinkled the granules around the entry hole and lightly watered the area. 
Many ants died within a few days, but others made a new entry a foot or two 
away. So we sprinkled Diazinon granules around that hole and moistened it. More 
ants died; and a week or two later, they opened another hole. We applied more 
of the granules there and watched for new openings. Every time they made a new 
hole we applied the Diazinon granules. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole process took about three months on this large, ancient colony, but 
it did the job -- with less than a full canister of Diazinon; and so far we 
haven't had ants since. By the way, the granules are about the size of large 
sand grains, and they don't seem to attract attention from pets or children; 
still, I'd be extra watchful for a few days after application in areas where 
there are pets or children. Raising Earthworms for Vegetable Garden 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Please devote a column on how to start and the benefits of raising 
earthworms for the vegetable garden. I would appreciate any information. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm afraid you sent me to the library with this one. I have no personal 
experience with the raising of earthworms. Two publications caught my 
attention, because they were both thorough and easy to read and understand: (1) 
"Let an Earthworm be Your Garbage Man," A Report by Home, Farm & Garden 
Research Associates, Burlington, Vermont; and (2) "Harnessing the Earthworm," 
by Thomas J. Barrett, Ontario, California, 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 The books affirm that earthworms promote optimal soil conditions, and they 
describe the process of starting and raising earthworms in great detail, both 
on a small scale and on a larger scale. They tell how to develop the proper 
culture medium, what food to provide, and where to collect worms to start. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it sounds fairly simple, the procedures outlined are perhaps too 
involved for me to give here. I hope you will obtain the books, and have a lot 
of fun with this endeavor.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: LOW-VOLTAGE OUTDOOR LIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I want to install outdoor lighting myself for security and 
landscaping because I cannot afford an electrician. What is new for 1994 in 
efficient do-it-yourself low-voltage lighting? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: There have been many improvements to do-it-yourself outdoor 
low-voltage (12-volt) lighting over the past several years. The new designs are 
easier to install with brighter lights, automatic controls and more styles 
available (tier, brick, flood, globe, well, spot, deck, bollard and spread). 
</P>
<P>
 Low-voltage lights are energy efficient. A do-it-yourself kit with six 
low-voltage lights uses less electricity than one standard 75-watt bulb. Since 
they operate on only 12 volts, low-voltage light kits are simple and safe to 
install. Just lay the wiring in the grass or on top of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two basic categories of low-voltage lights. Many inexpensive plastic 
kits are available at hardware stores. More expensive decorator die-cast metal, 
solid brass and redwood kits are available through lighting outlets. Even 
though kits may look similar, there are major differences in features and light 
output. 
</P>
<P>
 Simulated brick paving or edging low-voltage lights are one of the newest 
innovations. High-strength (can support a car) plastic paving lights are the 
exact size of a brick. The outside housing looks like a real brick. 
</P>
<P>
 Place these in a patio, driveway or walkway to light the path or accent 
landscaping. Another design uses snap-together bricks to form edging along a 
walk or garden. Wiring is built into these bricks for simple installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Several manufacturers offer adjustable low-voltage spot/floodlights. By 
turning a knob on the back or rotating the lens, the light beam ranges from a 
wide flood to a tight spot. You only need one light for two purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 For additional versatility, select a new convertible design. Interchangeable 
prismatic lens (multi-angle lens distributes light evenly) tier or floodlight 
tops snap onto the same base. 
</P>
<P>
 Since only the top light section needs to be changed, the entire fixture does 
not have to be removed and rewired. Santas, jack-o-lanterns and snowmen tops 
can be snapped on during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Several kits have new wire connection methods for easier installation. One 
method uses two small clips that snap together over the wire. Another method 
uses a cam lever action. Both hit the conductor on the first try. 
</P>
<P>
 Some new decorator die cast post lights have ivy leaves or cattails cast into 
them. With a natural variegated green color, they blend nicely into the garden. 
</P>
<P>

low-voltage lighting manufacturers listing styles, features, prices and a style 
selector/landscaping guide. Please mail $2 and a self-addressed envelope to

How to Fix Hissing and Gurgling Toilet 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My toilet always seems to be hissing and gurgling. I am sure that it is 
wasting a lot of water. How can I fix it myself? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A leaky toilet increases your water bills because it runs continuously. The 
noise is often caused by water leaking past a deteriorated stopper bulb in the 
tank. A bad float bulb or shut-off valve, which lets the water level rise too 
high may be the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacement parts cost only about $10 to fix either problem. Simple 
installation instructions are shown on the packaging or check your library for 
"fix it" books. They all cover simple toilet repair.
