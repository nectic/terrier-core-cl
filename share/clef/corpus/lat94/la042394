NIXON STILL COMATOSE IN FIGHT FOR LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Richard Nixon remained in a coma Friday, fighting for life 
with his family at his bedside. Ordinary citizens, past political foes and 
world leaders offered prayers for his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has changed. He is still in critical condition," said a weary press 
aide in Nixon's office. The former President suffered a massive stroke Monday 
at his home in Park Ridge, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same determination with which the 81-year-old Nixon has struggled back 
from Watergate and other crises seemed evident in the intensive care unit at 
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where he battled to pass through what 
typically is the period of maximum brain swelling after a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear was that the swelling would compress Nixon's brain stem, where key 
functions such as breathing and heart rhythm are controlled. Such compression 
often is a major cause of stroke fatalities. Physicians sought to contain the 
swelling through the use of medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, swelling can progress from the start of a stroke up to 96 hours 
after its onset. Nixon was rushed to the hospital Monday night, and a CT scan 
detected swelling on Tuesday. His level of consciousness declined as the damage 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
 But neurologists agree that when massive swelling has subsided, previously 
unanticipated degrees of recuperation have occurred. Both President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower -- who selected Nixon as his vice president -- and Nixon's wife, 
Pat, made excellent recoveries from strokes that for a time left them 
speech-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's stroke has left him partially blind, unable to speak and paralyzed on 
his right side. 
</P>
<P>
 Some time ago, Nixon made out a living will stating that he did not want 
heroic measures to be taken in the face of a devastating illness. Respecting 
his wishes, his breathing was not being assisted by a respirator. In an effort 
to reduce brain swelling, physicians sometimes use a respirator to speed up 
breathing. The effect is to temporarily change blood chemistry, which can 
shrink swelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Marine sergeants have visited the hospital and were ready to provide an 
honor guard should the former President not survive. "In the event of his 
death, the funeral would be held in the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, 
Calif. There are no plans for him to go to Washington," said Kim Taylor, a 
Nixon spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Former First Lady Barbara Bush visited the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace 
in Yorba Linda on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is in our thoughts, and what better place to be," Bush told about 1,000 
guests gathered to hear her talk about her years in the White House. "And he is 
in our prayers. He has been a good friend to the Bushes over the years, and we 
have enormous respect for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am honored to be here also because of that gentle, strong, courageous woman 
filled with love, Pat Nixon," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush recalled that Richard Nixon offered her advice and support, especially 
when she and President George Bush were criticized by the media. She said that 
Nixon was particularly comforting during the controversy over her plans to make 
the commencement address at Wellesley College in 1990, when some students 
questioned whether a homemaker who dropped out of college should be chosen to 
speak to the graduating class. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best letter I received was from Dick Nixon," she recalled. "He said he 
was outraged and that I should go out there and give them hell." 
</P>
<P>
 George S. McGovern, Nixon's 1972 presidential opponent, told an audience in 
Overland Park, Kan., that he and Nixon had become friendly in recent years. He 
said they exchanged letters, and last year he attended the funeral of Nixon's 
wife, who died of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ancient history as far as I'm concerned," McGovern said of Watergate, 
the scandal that drove Nixon from office. "You can't carry a grudge forever." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Hillary Rodham Clinton was asked at a White House news conference 
how history will judge Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I don't know that it's time to start talking like that yet," she said. 
"I think that what we ought to be doing is praying for President Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my perspective, you know, it was a year ago April that my father died at 
the age of 81. And so you know, I'm just mostly thinking about his daughters 
(Tricia Cox and Julie Eisenhower) right now," the First Lady added. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's father died from complications from a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, a revolution in stroke care has begun. A number of 
medications designed to limit brain damage are undergoing clinical trials, and 
some look promising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stroke therapy is entering a new era, and that has to be reflected in new 
viewing of the problem," said Dr. Fred Plum, the chief neurologist at New York 
Hospital who is treating Nixon. "Almost all major centers are involved in 
trials of one new agent or another." 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is important to do stroke education. It takes a number of hours 
before brain damage is fully established," said Dr. J.P. Mohr, director of the 
neurovascular unit at the New York Neurological Institute. "The earlier we can 
intervene, the better."

CLINTON NAMES 2 ECONOMISTS TO FED BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton filled two vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board Friday, 
appointing White House economist Alan Blinder as vice chairman and UC Berkeley 
economist Janet Yellen to a second seat on the Fed's seven-member board of 
governors. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder and Yellen would be the first Democratic appointees to the board since 
1980. Moreover, the appointments could give Clinton a chance to influence 
interest rate policies at the nation's central bank, which uses interest rates 
to regulate the pace of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder, 48, a former Princeton economist who has played a key role in 
virtually every aspect of Clinton Administration economic policy, appears to be 
the odds-on favorite to succeed Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan when his term 
expires in March, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely anticipated appointments come at a crucial time for relations 
between the Fed and the White House. The Fed, still dominated by Republican 
appointees, including Greenspan, has raised interest rates three times since 
February and seems certain to raise them further in coming months to combat 
what it perceives as the threat of future inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration, while refraining from directly criticizing Fed policy, 
still argues that there is no sign that inflation is getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing together at a White House press briefing, both Blinder and Yellen 
declined to comment on Fed policy, arguing that they will wait to discuss their 
views until their confirmation hearings before the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's financial markets have been fearful that Clinton would try to 
pack the Fed with advocates of easy money policies who would allow inflation to 
go unchecked. For that reason, the Administration's nominees appear to be wary 
of making any statements that could roil Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
 Yellen, 47, is a former Fed and Harvard economist with broad interests, 
ranging from the behavior of youth gangs to the dynamics of labor markets. She 
described herself to reporters as a "non-ideological pragmatist." 
</P>
<P>
 As a faculty member at UC Berkeley, she had been a colleague of fellow 
Berkeley economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who was chosen by Clinton to serve as 
chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Tyson, in fact, was 
deeply involved in the selection process for filling the Fed vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellen, who would succeed Republican Wayne Angell on the board, also fulfills 
the Administration's desire to name a woman or a minority to offset the 
appointment of Blinder, a white male, to be Fed vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder, a longtime friend and classmate of Tyson's at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, has served as her principal deputy at the CEA since 
the beginning of the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In past comments, Blinder has made it clear that he shares the 
Administration's view that inflation is not as big a threat as the Fed's 
leadership believes. As vice chairman, he would succeed David Mullins, a George 
Bush Administration appointee who resigned in February.  
</P>
<P>
 Blinder not only would bring the voice of the Administration to the Fed, he 
would also bring a baby boomer sensibility to one of the most staid and 
convention-laden institutions in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 When his appointment was announced at the White House by Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen, Blinder stepped to the microphone and quoted Monty Python, the 
British comedy troupe that developed a cult following in the United States in 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "In thinking about this change in positions from the CEA to the Federal 
Reserve over the last few days or even weeks, I can't get the Monty Python line 
out of my head: 'And now for something completely different,' " Blinder said. 
"It will be different in many, many ways, not the least of which is that the 
role of the CEA, as all of you know, is entirely advisory. At the Federal 
Reserve, I will be getting advice from all quarters of society all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that they have not ruled out the prospect of 
reappointing Greenspan to a third term as Fed chairman. Greenspan was 
originally appointed chairman in 1987 by Ronald Reagan -- succeeding Paul A. 
Volcker, one of the most powerful Fed chairmen in history. He was reappointed 
in 1991 by Bush, but his second four-year term did not begin until 1992, when 
Congress finally approved his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's willingness to consider reappointing Greenspan appears to 
fade each time the Fed moves to ratchet up interest rates. If Greenspan is not 
reappointed, Blinder will clearly be the leading candidate. In fact, Blinder 
rejected an earlier offer to fill the board seat that is now going to Yellen 
because he was not interested in serving simply as one of the seven board 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been clear to other potential candidates that the vice chairmanship 
slot could lead to the top job at the Fed; Brookings Institution economist 
George Perry turned down the second Fed544629091the inside track to succeed 
Greenspan.

<P>
 Thousands of people with Soviet flags and red carnations lined up on Red 
Square to pay their respects to V. I. Lenin on Friday, the 124th anniversary of 
his birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian newspapers published several stories about Lenin and the modern 
significance of what was among the most important dates in the former Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 On a bright, crisp day, as many as 10,000 people silently filed through 
Lenin's chilly mausoleum to view the body preserved under glass. Many of the 
mostly elderly visitors brought flowers, flags and portraits of Lenin.

 The four owners of a central Madrid disco, where 81 people burned or 
suffocated to death in 1983, and two other people were found guilty of 
negligence on Friday and sentenced to jail terms of up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A Madrid court also said the state should pay a total of $14 million in 
compensation to the victims' families. Hundreds of teen-agers forced their way 
through blocked fire doors in the basement rock club Alcala 20 when the blaze 
took hold in the early hours of a Saturday morning, but others were trapped 
inside.

HAWAII PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ESCALATE STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A government workers strike escalated Friday when nearly 6,000 state and 
county employees walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 A third union bargaining unit, made up of professional and scientific workers, 
joined 10,000 white-collar workers and supervisors who struck the state and its 
four counties on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion of the strike forced closure of all recreation centers, gyms and 
swimming pools in Honolulu, Mayor Frank Fasi said. The strike already closed 
all public libraries and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and firefighters remain on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Agriculture advised importers to delay shipments 
because only a few state inspectors have been declared essential. 
</P>
<P>
 The three units have nearly 20,000 members, but 3,800 were declared essential 
to public health and safety and were ordered to remain on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal mediator Frank Schoeppel spent Thursday shuttling between negotiators 
for employers and the Hawaii Government Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks recessed Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state has made an offer, the (union) negotiating teams are reviewing the 
offer, and we will be making our counter at the appropriate time," the union's 
executive director, Russell Okata, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the offer weren't available. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is seeking a minimum 8% pay raise over two years while the state and 
counties have offered 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The new group of strikers includes engineers, accountants, pharmacists, 
psychologists, social workers and some managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the United Public Workers, which represents state and county 
blue-collar workers and supervisors, said it would announce Monday results of 
its contract ratification vote.

CLINTON, AIDES HUDDLE OVER COURT NOMINEE; JUDICIARY: CONCERN IS EXPRESSED ON 
HEALTH ISSUE SURROUNDING ARNOLD. CABRANES' NAME MAY BE RECEDING BECAUSE GROUPS 
CALL HIM TOO CONSERVATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton and some of his top advisers met Friday afternoon to 
consider possible Supreme Court nominees from a still-shifting list. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making progress," Lloyd N. Cutler, White House special counsel, said 
after a session that lasted more than an hour. The White House is in the third 
week of the selection process and hopes to name a replacement for retiring 
Justice Harry A. Blackmun by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the key questions is one involving the health of U.S. Appeals Court 
Judge Richard S. Arnold, a widely respected Arkansan who battled cancer several 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 While Arnold's physicians have told White House officials that he is in good 
health, a medical report could not guarantee that the cancer would not recur. 
Some officials have taken the view that unless a recurrence can be ruled out, 
the 58-year-old jurist is too risky a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The health question is only one potential political issue involving Arnold. 
Some White House advisers worry that a President already besieged by charges of 
favoritism toward friends from Arkansas cannot afford to name a Little Rock 
resident to the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Jose A. Cabranes, of Connecticut, has been another 
front-runner. But officials say his name may be receding because some 
Democratic interest groups consider him too conservative. Others have said that 
his relatively brief tenure on the court and his meager legal writings make him 
a less desirable candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the notion of appointing the first Latino justice has appeal at the 
White House, other top Latino candidates have yet to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 Another contender is Amalya L. Kearse, a 56-year-old federal appeals court 
judge in New York. Kearse is reputed to have a brilliant legal mind. She is the 
first black woman ever to become a partner at a major New York law firm, and 
her nomination could gain the White House points for naming the first black 
woman to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 In judicial philosophy, she is not a traditional liberal, but more in the mold 
of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Clinton's first high court appointee. For that 
reason, she also might appeal to the President's centrist instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kearse could draw fire from some Latino and Asian American interest 
groups, who may feel slighted if a second black jurist were added to the court. 
Latinos' expectations in particular have been raised by talk that the White 
House is interested in selecting a candidate from their increasingly 
influential political group. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice of Kearse also would come at the expense of the White House's 
desire to put a political figure, rather than a jurist, on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and aides have both argued that recent choices have leaned too heavily 
toward candidates who have impeccable legal credentials but lack the kind of 
world view that experienced politicians can bring.

FEARS GROW AS U.N. TROOPS BEGIN PULLOUT FROM RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As U.N. forces retreated from Rwanda on Friday, fears mounted for the safety 
of hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped by violence that is estimated to 
have claimed up to 100,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 U.N. peacekeepers flew out of the country Friday, ferried to 
Nairobi, Kenya, in Canadian transport planes. The U.N. Security Council voted 
Thursday to cut its original force of 2,500 in Rwanda to no more than 270. 
</P>
<P>
 Of special concern were more than 20,000 refugees from the tribal slaughter 
who have sought U.N. protection in the embattled Rwandan capital of Kigali. 
U.N. officials admitted that some of the refugee sites are little more than 
"death traps." 
</P>
<P>
 The International Committee of the Red Cross, which said it had rarely 
witnessed a human tragedy on the scale of that in Rwanda, had urged the United 
Nations not to pull out its peacekeepers. It cited evidence of continuing 
massacres and pronounced the tiny country on the brink of famine. Human rights 
groups echoed the sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest convulsion of ethnic violence -- in a country with a long history 
of conflict between the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsi -- was set off 
when the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi were killed in a plane 
crash April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports of sporadic fighting Friday in Bujumbura, the capital of 
Burundi, which shares a similar Hutu-Tutsi ethnic makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 A new round of peace talks, meanwhile, was slated to begin today between the 
Hutu-dominated interim government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels, who 
are predominantly from the Tutsi tribe, in the northern Tanzanian city of 
Arusha. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous U.N. efforts to bring the two sides together for a serious discussion 
of peace have failed, and the rebels have continued their slow advance on the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials reached in Kigali on Friday said thousands of rebel 
reinforcements are believed heading for the capital after they reportedly 
captured the town of Rwamagana, 25 miles to the east. The rebels now control a 
broad swath of northern Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half a million people have fled their homes in Rwanda since fighting 
began. Yet fewer than 20,000 have crossed into neighboring countries, their 
traditional sanctuaries in times of trouble. Aid officials say most of the 
borders have been sealed by the Rwandan army.

ROSTENKOWSKI WARNS OF HEALTH PLAN TAX HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said Friday that a broad-based tax increase may 
be needed to meet President Clinton's goal of assuring medical coverage for 
every American -- a financing option that Clinton sought to avoid for fear it 
would dampen public support for health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the basic 
approach of the Clinton health care plan -- increasing competition in the 
medical marketplace -- ultimately would bring costs under better control. But 
"that doesn't happen until later," he said in a speech to the Harvard School of 
Public Health in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best guess is that we will need tens of billions of dollars annually by 
the turn of the century. . . . So there's ample reason to wonder whether a 
broad tax increase will be required that has some impact on virtually every 
American," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski did not elaborate on the specific tax he thought would be 
necessary, except to say that "the time isn't right" for a value-added tax, a 
form of sales tax used in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet his comments underscored a growing realization on Capitol Hill that health 
care reform cannot be as painless as Clinton has portrayed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have a truth-in-legislating standard to meet, and that requires me to 
remind you that we still haven't found the health fairy, and we're not terribly 
optimistic that we will," Rostenkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office has undercut arguments by the Administration 
and others that the more-competitive health care market they envision can 
generate almost enough savings to finance universal coverage. Many lawmakers 
also are leery of the Clinton proposal to rein in health care costs through 
government price controls. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that the American people are sophisticated enough to realize that 
you only get what you pay for. And if you want more, you have to pay more," 
Rostenkowski said. "The question now is not whether people are willing to make 
this contribution -- because it is clear to me that they are -- but rather, 
what the fairest way to structure it will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, asked at a news conference about Rostenkowski's comments, said: "I 
think Mr. Rostenkowski is trying to achieve our common objectives, which he 
defined as universal coverage, cost control and 218 votes (a majority in the 
House). And I think he has a strategy for pursuing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Clinton said, "we've worked very hard on the numbers. We think they are 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski also said he thought the idea of expanding Medicare to cover 
those who do not get adequate coverage through an employer -- a concept 
embraced by his panel's health subcommittee -- was "a good one." He noted that 
Medicare has a good record of holding down costs, and that senior citizens are 
more satisfied than other Americans with the quality of the health care they 
get.

BROWN KICKS OFF SMALL-BUSINESS LOAN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown put on two hats Friday, as the state's treasurer and a 
Democratic candidate for governor, to kick off a new government program for 
small businesses that helps fulfill her campaign pledge to create 1 million new 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the California Capital Access Program is partly to help fledgling 
companies get an early boost by making small-business loans easier to obtain. 
Brown launched the program Friday at a booming 2-year-old manufacturing company 
that was having cash-flow problems and being courted by other states for 
relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am on a mission to create 1 million new jobs," Brown said in the warehouse 
of Timberline Gas Logs Co., maker of simulated logs for gas fireplaces. "By 
providing access to affordable loans, Cal-CAP will help many small businesses 
like Timberline get the dollars needed to expand, invest in research and 
equipment and hire workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's appearance was actually a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a program that 
she already broadcast in a news conference in January and was unveiled in 
legislation signed in October by her Republican rival, Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of Friday's event was to recognize the award of the first 
Cal-CAP assisted loan to Timberline -- for $500,000 -- and for Brown to 
underscore her pledge to create 1 million California jobs by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobs pledge was part of a new focus that Brown's campaign introduced at 
last weekend's state Democratic convention, along with a new team of 
strategists and staff. Since the announcement, however, the idea has been 
sharply criticized as a campaign gimmick by Wilson and the other Democratic 
candidates -- state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom 
Hayden (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's opponents noted that economists have already predicted that the 
state's economy should create 1 million jobs over the next four years no matter 
who is governor. Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting 
Project, said Friday that his department's most recent study actually calls for 
1.2 million new jobs in California by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown responded to her critics Friday: "If you look back, the economic 
forecasts in 1990, 1991 said there would be 170,000 jobs created. California, 
in fact, lost double that number. So economists make forecasts just like 
weathermen, weather people, make forecasts." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, spokesman for the governor, and Elena Stern, spokeswoman for 
Garamendi's campaign, ridiculed the idea that Brown was taking credit for 1 
million jobs that are already expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her campaign slogan might as well be, 'Vote for me and I will stay out of the 
way,' " Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Timberline Co. on Friday, President Jeff Straubel said the loan 
provided by the Cal-CAP program will help the company add about 30 employees to 
its 100-member work force. He described the payment as a godsend. "It is going 
to allow us to ship our products on time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Cal-CAP program, the loan is provided by a bank, but it is partially 
insured by money from a state reserve fund. The reserve fund includes state 
money acquired through corporate fees as well as contributions from the 
borrower and the lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael K. Gallagher, a Wells Fargo Bank officer at the news conference 
Friday, said Timberline did not qualify under the bank's usual lending 
standards because it is too young. With Cal-CAP assistance, however, Gallagher 
said the bank's lending standards have been lowered, allowing the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of public-private partnerships we can develop to restore the 
California promise of good, decent-paying jobs," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation was initiated last year by the California Bankers Assn. based 
on similar models operating in four other states. Brown campaign officials said 
the candidate played a major role in support for the legislation and her office 
oversees the state money that operates the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the state has provided an initial $1 million for the program, which 
is expected to leverage about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Brostrom, an aide in the treasurer's office, said the program has been 
operating since 1986 in Michigan, where 2,700 loans have provided a total of 
$120 million.

CHANCELLOR OKD SALE OF 4,000 ROSE BOWL TICKETS; ATHLETICS: UCLA OFFICIAL 
APPROVED THE TRANSACTION WITH A FOOTBALL BOOSTER IN EXCHANGE FOR A $100,000 
CONTRIBUTION. THE DEAL WAS STRUCK TWO DAYS BEFORE THE TEAM'S OPPONENT WAS 
DETERMINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young approved the sale of 4,000 1994 Rose Bowl 
tickets to a football booster who wanted to put together package tours to the 
New Year's Day event and who offered to make a "significant" contribution to 
the Westwood school, school officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Young gave the go-ahead to sell the tickets to booster Angelo M. Mazzone III 
-- a former athletic department employee and longtime acquaintance of the 
chancellor -- in a meeting with Athletic Director Peter Dalis two days before 
UCLA's Rose Bowl opponent was determined, said Joseph D. Mandel, vice 
chancellor of legal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Dec 2, Peter Dalis met with the chancellor and informed him of Mazzone's 
offer," Mandel said. "That's when they struck the agreement." Mandel added: 
"Yes, he (Young) approved it." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday, Young said he could not recall if he was asked to 
approve the sale or if he was told details. But he confirmed he was informed 
about the impending deal "with the understanding" that Mazzone would make a 
large contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, I don't recall that I was told the amount of the tickets or the 
amount of the contribution, but I knew it was a substantial amount of tickets 
and a substantial contribution," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone, who was a student equipment manager for UCLA's football team and 
later associate athletic director, paid face value of $184,000 for the tickets 
and gave the school $100,000 for athletic scholarships. Mazzone is a longtime 
friend of football coach Terry Donahue and known by Young as someone who 
"handles investments." 
</P>
<P>
 Disclosures about UCLA's sale of tickets to Mazzone have fanned controversy 
surrounding the game. Irate University of Wisconsin fans have claimed that they 
were stranded without promised tickets or were forced to pay scalper's prices. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Wisconsin Atty. Gen. James Doyle said UCLA's sale to Mazzone was a 
factor in placing large numbers of tickets in the hands of brokers and 
scalpers. On Friday, a Madison, Wis., law firm added UCLA and the University of 
California regents as defendants in a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of 
Wisconsin fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our opinion, the actions of UCLA were a substantial factor in causing the 
market to go totally out of control for the sale of Rose Bowl tickets . . . and 
caused the price to skyrocket," attorney James A. Olson said.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, sources told The Times that Mazzone sold the 4,000 tickets to Al 
Brooks Theatre Ticket Agency, one of Los Angeles' oldest ticket brokers. 
Reached at his office in the Downtown Los Angeles Hilton, owner Jaron (Jay) 
Brooks declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 4,000 tickets sold to Mazzone, 148 were for goal-line seats and the 
remainder were for seats behind the end zones, a UCLA ticket official said. The 
face value of each ticket was $46, but days before the game the going price was 
10 times higher. 
</P>
<P>
 According to records included in the lawsuit, Mazzone's allotment of tickets 
was the largest for an individual. 
</P>
<P>
 In selling the tickets to Mazzone, Young said UCLA officials wanted to avoid a 
repeat of what happened to the University of Washington with the 1993 Rose 
Bowl, when $250,000 worth of tickets went begging. Having empty stands during 
the nationally broadcast event "sends the wrong message," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said he was told that Mazzone, whom he has "known for a long time . . . 
was in the travel business and would use (the tickets) as a part of packaging 
that he would do." The chancellor said he has no idea where the tickets wound 
up and has not checked to see if they were scalped. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not illegal to scalp tickets," Young said. "Why should I ask him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone did not return repeated telephone calls Friday from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Young blamed the controversy on the inordinate demand for tickets by Wisconsin 
fans, whose team had not played in the Rose Bowl game since 1963. He said UCLA 
has examined the transaction and "we don't believe we did anything in violation 
of the (Rose Bowl) agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 UC Regent Ward Connerly, who learned of the lawsuit Friday, blamed Young for 
not giving top university administrators and regents a "heads up" about the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm also troubled by the possibility that we have locked a number of people 
out of an event by selling a block of 4,000 tickets to an individual," Connerly 
said. Times staff writers Rick Holguin and Steve Springer contributed to this 
story.

CELLULAR THERAPY; BUSINESSMAN TAKES PHONE, FAX AND COMPUTER TO HOSPITAL ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The high-tech equipment arranged around Gary Becker's hospital bed blinked, 
beeped and buzzed the other day after doctors wheeled him out of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 These machines weren't hooked up to Becker, though. They were pumping 
lifeblood into his company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agoura businessman brought in a computer, modem, beeper, fax machine and 
cellular telephone after he checked into a Van Nuys hospital to be treated for 
injuries from a motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last week, Becker, 39, has run his tiny aerospace parts supply firm 
from Room 646 of Valley Presbyterian Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 While doctors keep a watchful eye on his medical charts, Becker has kept tabs 
on his inventory, accounts receivable and shipping orders. 
</P>
<P>
 There's good reason for such careful scrutiny on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 After two operations, surgeons were forced Thursday to amputate a portion of 
one badly infected finger. 
</P>
<P>
 But after five years of struggling in the cutthroat wholesale electronics 
field, Becker was determined to keep his three-employee J R Industries of 
Westlake Village healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker first thought the injury to his right-hand ring finger was minor after 
he crashed his dirt bike on an outing two weeks ago in Newbury Park. Even after 
infection set in and stitches seemed to fail, Becker figured he would only be 
off work for a day or so. 
</P>
<P>
 When doctors in Van Nuys told him he faced a hospital stay, he was determined 
not to take it lying down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually didn't ask if I could bring the computer and other stuff in. I 
just had my company driver bring it over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he jokingly asked nurses if "anybody around here uses pacemakers -- I'm 
about to plug in," they called hospital technicians to come look at the unusual 
gear.  
</P>
<P>
 "I almost fell over when I saw it. I don't know how he snuck it past me," 
nurse Phyllis Weinstein said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurse Rubbie Bullock -- who entered the medical field after aerospace layoffs 
in 1989 eliminated her job as a Northrop B-2 bomber assembly-line worker -- 
said she understood Becker's motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that business, you've got to keep up," Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors quickly decided the equipment was good medicine for Becker. Besides 
keeping his mind off his injuries, it was also making him exercise by getting 
in and out of bed to switch the phone line between the computer modem, the fax 
machine and his hospital room telephone handset, orthopedic surgeon David 
Auerbach said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Becker devised a way to reserve his room's phone line for computer and 
fax use while using his beeper and cellular telephone to handle incoming calls. 
</P>
<P>
 He also scrounged up an extension phone cable in case he needed to string it 
into the room next door and barter with fellow patients for the right to tap 
into their telephone outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials were surprised by his resourcefulness. "We want to make 
patients feel at home," said Valley Presbyterian Vice President Hal Wurtzel. 
"But we've never had a situation like this before." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, a father of two who also volunteers as a Los Angeles Police Department 
reserve officer in the west San Fernando Valley, said his hospital stay has 
taught him a few things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm a workaholic. I apologized to my wife, Kathy, about shortchanging 
the family in the past on vacations," he said. "This has proved to me that me 
that I could probably work from a beach in the Bahamas. . . . I'm going to get 
a laptop computer." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker said he expects to be released from the hospital Monday. But if he 
isn't, he knows what's next. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to get a dedicated phone line in here for the fax," he said. "And a 
file cabinet."

MORE PARKING TICKETS ARE PART OF RIORDAN PLAN; BUDGET: HIS PROPOSAL TO REPLACE 
WESTSIDE CITY TRAFFIC OFFICERS WITH A PRIVATE COMPANY GETS A MIXED REACTION. 
THE MAYOR SAYS CHANGES CAN BRING IN $9 MILLION MORE A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan promised his city budget would deliver more. 
More police. More street repairs. More graffiti removal. 
</P>
<P>
 And more parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 One small chapter in the $4.3-billion spending plan that Riordan introduced 
this week would beef up parking enforcement crews -- with a private company 
taking over the job on the Westside and more municipal parking officers fanning 
out across the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrepreneurial mayor believes that a net increase of 100 parking officers 
citywide will easily bring in $9 million more a year. That's without even 
calculating how much more rapidly the private crews on the Westside -- armed 
with electronic ticket writers and deployed by computer mapping -- may be able 
to paper windshields with pink citations. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan wants to use the deployment of the private ticket writers, which still 
needs City Council approval, as the first test of his theory that some 
government services can be delivered more efficiently by the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect the public sector to become more efficient through the 
competition," Riordan said in his budget address. 
</P>
<P>
 Westsiders should not feel singled out, the mayor's advisers insist. They said 
the region was chosen by city transportation officials for the pilot parking 
enforcement program because it offers the widest range of parking restrictions 
in the most compact geographic area. And the 100 city parking officers now 
working on the Westside will be redeployed around the rest of Los Angeles, 
meaning more tickets for everyone, said transportation department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the expected arrival of private parking officers sometime this year is 
a sobering notion for some -- from the Westsiders who say that the area could 
become less hospitable for shoppers to the municipal parking enforcement 
officers who worry that their meal ticket is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Automobile Club of Southern California said they will be 
watching the city's program closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citizens may be sort of ticked if they can't overstay a meter by 30 seconds," 
said Alice Bisno, the auto club's manager of government affairs. "Enforcement 
officers need to use a certain amount of judgment. We are concerned that they 
operate properly, because tickets are getting so expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 And the head of a West Hollywood business group has complained that private 
enforcement officers in that city have been overly zealous. Sheriff's 
Department employees who did the job previously were "a little more 
compassionate toward customers and not as instantaneous" with tickets, said 
Michael Radcliff, president of the West Hollywood Community Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 A union official for Los Angeles traffic enforcement officers predicts that 
the private workers will become "parking privateers," driven to meet ticket 
quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Butcher, a spokeswoman for Service Employees International Union Local 
347, noted that the city's 500 traffic enforcement officers do much more than 
issue tickets. They are also responsible for directing traffic through busy 
intersections and at special events, for enforcing street closures and for 
removing abandoned vehicles from roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Carpenter, a 21-year officer who works on the Westside, said any 
private firm will have little incentive to perform those services. "You got a 
car blocking your driveway at 3 in the morning now, we respond," Carpenter 
said. "You want to have a block party, we respond. And when there is a 
disaster, you probably never give a second thought that we are there 
controlling the signals and moving traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contractor is not interested in service, only in making money." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Yates, general manager of the city Department of Transportation, said 
the city can prevent a private firm from neglecting other traffic control 
duties by requiring those in the firm's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Riordan's aides said they are not prejudging the outcome of the pilot 
program, they privately cite figures showing that private parking officers 
issue tickets at twice the rate of government workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the city Department of Transportation's figures show that officers who 
produced up to 55 citations a day in 1990 are averaging just 36 a day this 
year, Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
 City traffic officers, or T.O.s as they call themselves, said many factors 
have driven the numbers down. These include higher fines that have made drivers 
less likely to risk tickets, the fact that vehicle registration citations are 
no longer issued by traffic officers, and a shift in most work schedules of 
traffic officers -- inspired by a city hiring freeze -- that has most of them 
spending more time directing traffic and less issuing tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, they note, ticket issuance was discontinued for several days in the 
aftermath of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher argued that if Riordan wants "a fair fight" on the question of who can 
issue the most tickets, he should arm city employees with the same high-tech 
gear as private industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Michael Keeley said the request for proposals from private firms 
is designed to account for such variables so a fair comparison can be made. And 
Riordan said during his budget address that he only wants to try private firms 
as a "competitive benchmark" to test the efficiency of city employees. He said 
that if city workers are proven to do a better job, he will hire more of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carpenter and other T.O.s said they worry that it is only a matter of time 
before private firms are awarded all the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are entry-level jobs that give people a chance to contribute to the 
community," Carpenter said. "Without that, they can't get in and get training 
and provide for their families. It's Riordan's way, but it's not stabilizing 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
 In the city's poor and minority neighborhoods, Civil Service workers say they 
have remained a stabilizing force as manufacturing and other jobs have 
dwindled. Private firms' employees probably would be paid less, work only part 
time and receive skimpier benefits, the opponents predict. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor, however, insisted Wednesday: "I will not support privatization that 
relies on substandard wages or inadequate benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Johnson, who started 24 years ago as a ticket writer and now is the 
city's chief of parking enforcement operations, said he sees both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the younger workers who call in sick or take days off on seemingly 
minor workers' compensation claims, Johnson said. It makes him long for the 
days when he started, when "there was a considerable amount of pride and a 
considerable amount of esprit de corps in what we were doing."

 Although he appreciates Riordan's drive for efficiency, Johnson said, "There 
is something to be said for the city employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't see it as a job, but as a way of life," he concluded. "It's sad 
if it's not there anymore."

CITYSCAPES / JOHN M. GLIONNA: 'ALL YOU SEE TODAY ARE SNEAKERS. I TELL YOU, THE 
DAY OF THE WELL-DRESSED MAN IS DEAD.'; MOST OF THE WORLD WALKS ON BY, BUT THE 
MEMORIES STILL SHINE

<P>
 Sometimes, during the depressingly long stretches between customers, Lee 
Calton sits in the big maroon High Chair at the Burbank airport and reminisces 
about the fast-stepping, spit-polished heyday of the professional shoeshine. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that was back in the 1930s and 1940s, when Hollywood's elite -- the 
actors and producers, directors and agents, gangsters and politicians -- all 
stepped up to Calton's chair at Rothschild's haberdashery in Beverly Hills for 
a five-minute shine and a strong dose of street wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 His regulars were the likes of Bugsy Siegel, Al Capone, Mickey Cohen, Clark 
Gable, Spencer Tracy, Groucho Marx, Nelson Rockefeller and Cecil B. De Mille -- 
well-dressed men who, like Calton, appreciated the subtle aesthetics of the 
freshly polished shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 They were spanking, elegant times when Calton entertained customers by 
snapping an old cotton polish rag in perfect rhythm to the high-blown jazz and 
big band tunes that played on his portable radio -- laughing and scatting and 
making people smile and shake their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, when he wasn't working the door at the old Beverly Hills Tropics 
nightclub, a lean and wiry Calton would himself step out on the town, dressed 
in his dapper fedora, double-breasted suit, gold jewelry and the finest pair of 
brown-toned leather beauties money could buy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall behind his shoeshine stand at the airport hangs a gallery of old 
black and white photographs showing a much younger Calton in his nightclub 
days, sharing a table with Nat (King) Cole -- always natty, always smiling, 
unmistakably full of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ha! Ha! Ha! I sure spent some money in those days," he says, flashing a 
tattoo on his left forearm, the now-faded image of a nude woman coiled in a 
champagne glass. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At age 82, Calton can no longer make a living from the job that bought him 
half a dozen new cars and paid for his one-story dream house. Still, he arrives 
each day at 5:45 a.m. at the airport barbershop -- not for what little he earns 
for the occasional $2 shine, but as a way to hold onto the cologne-scented 
atmosphere of the swirling shoe wax, saddle soap and friendly banter he has 
come to love. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Calton gazes out the shop window and wonders how his footlight parade of 
cigar-smoking customers dwindled to the few still willing to sit for a 
shoeshine and take an unhurried look back at yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at that!" Calton scoffs, pointing to a passerby. "All you see today are 
sneakers. I tell you, the day of the well-dressed man is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The result has put professionals like Calton right out of business. Once a 
staple of barbershops and fine hotels in post-World War II America, shoeshining 
is a disappearing trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Although statistics are hard to come by, shoeshine stands have become nearly 
extinct except for airports and an occasional city street, as leather has given 
way to cheap plastic and synthetics that don't need shining. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shoeshine profession is like a dinosaur, it's dying out before our eyes," 
said Jack Lavin, a spokesman for the Hotel and Restaurant Employees 
International Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "America's dress code has changed. The shiny shoes and creased pants look is 
gone. Gone forever. And the shoeshine is sure to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a lone relay runner, Calton says he has no one to whom he can pass his 
shoeshine brush: "Nobody wants this job. Kids today, they think it's demeaning 
to even think about shining somebody else's shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Calton's artful hands, blackened by boot polish, still go proudly about 
their business day after day, a pair of wrinkled experts that over 70 years 
have known their way around more than a million pairs of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to keep shining shoes until the day I die, or my profession dies 
off," he sighs. "Whichever comes first." 
</P>
<P>
 As he has since 1971, Calton still caters to a handful of loyal Burbank 
airport businessmen -- because nobody knows shoes like Calton. 
</P>
<P>
 All day long, the eighth-grade dropout spouts little bits of wisdom that have 
taken a career to compile: that Italian-made leather is the best bargain on the 
planet, that black wears better than brown, that it takes a really special 
polish to beat the baking heat of the Western desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers seem to come back for the conversation as much as the shoeshine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so surprising that a man who has shined shoes all his life is so 
knowledgeable about current affairs," said Jarman Holland, a computer salesman 
who has visited Calton for more than a decade. "Every time I sit in the chair, 
Lee's ready to talk turkey." 
</P>
<P>
 Calton still has the body of a man half his age, the taut frame of a boxer or 
a gymnast -- flat stomach, muscular forearms. And the smile, it wins you. 
</P>
<P>
 And how he still likes to dress, still likes the image of himself in expensive 
suits and shiny shoes, a reminder of the days when his step was quicker, when 
he and his profession were young. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Calton came to California in 1934 shining shoes. He had left home in Arcadia, 
La., years earlier and hitched a ride on a freight train to the East Texas oil 
fields, where a friend taught him the shining trade -- a job that Calton 
remembers thinking was good, honest work. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summers, Calton recalls, he became a utility player with different 
teams in the old Negro baseball leagues -- the Kansas City Monarchs, Halstead 
Greys or American Giants out of Chicago -- the teams that were the only game in 
town for black players when the big leagues were white preserves. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had the most fun touring with the African Zulus -- which back then was 
baseball's version of the Harlem Globetrotters. In fact, he says, the team was 
run by Abe Saperstein, the Globetrotters' owner, and they used the same touring 
bus as the basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, the Zulus sure raised some eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd roll into town and conversations would stop in mid-word," Calton says. 
"All of us were barefooted, wearing these big wigs and grass skirts. We were 
supposed to be straight out of Africa and we played our games in these get-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "In small towns, we gave people heart attacks, scared them to death getting 
off that bus, ballyhooing at each other in this fake African dialect, 
'Who-bally-bally-who-ahhhh!' Later, we would just die laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Calton worked in Beverly Hills until the late 1940s, when he 
took a yearlong job as butler for the late actor Tyrone Power. After that, he 
spent 17 years at the Los Angeles Athletic Club -- shining shoes by day, 
working the door at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, those Beverly Hills days still stick in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the time gangster Bugsy Siegel arrived at the haberdashery with his 
entourage and caught Calton gawking at him through the barbershop window. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you looking at?" the gangster snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing, Mr. Siegel," Calton remembers responding. "It's just that you look 
like hell in that sports jacket." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after a manicure, Siegel walked past Calton and threw the jacket on his 
lap: "I'll always remember how he looked at me and said, 'Here, you SOB, the 
jacket's yours now.' I wore that jacket for years and years." 
</P>
<P>
 Or the day he yanked Cecil B. De Mille from his chair with a panicked pull of 
his shine cloth. The director was discussing with a fellow customer his most 
recent project, which he mentioned had cost $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just never heard of that kind of money before," Calton recalls. "I was 
so shocked I pulled back on the cloth and he almost fell out of the chair. I 
apologized and told him that I couldn't imagine what $4 million even looked 
like. And he just tipped his head back and laughed." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, with all the memories and their sweet retelling, shoeshine Lee 
Calton tips his own head back and he laughs, too.

STUDENTS GET LESSONS ON THE ENVIRONMENT; EARTH DAY: A HOST OF SCHOOL-SPONSORED 
ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE COUNTY MARK THE ANNUAL CELEBRATION.

 Educators and environmentalists celebrated Earth Day on Friday, working with 
those they hope will one day save the planet: the children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Fred Williams School in south Oxnard dramatized their 
pro-environment message with a cast of cardboard sea animals. Colorful 
creatures such as Sam the Clam and Clark the Shark taught other elementary 
schoolchildren not to leave trash at the beach where it could harm marine life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to save the earth," said 10-year-old Eileen Torres as she took her 
position behind the light projector for a 20-minute class production. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Elmhurst School in nearby Ventura spent the morning sorting 
through sacks of trash that they generated at school in one week. The 
elementary school has no recycling program for disposable dishes used in the 
cafeteria. But Jessie McLeod's third-grade students are working on a plan to 
take their classroom recycling program schoolwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to recycle so we don't turn our earth into a trash pile," said Jesse 
White, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 At Madrona School in Thousand Oaks, elementary students assembled bird feeders 
from used half-gallon milk cartons and planted an embankment with sunflower 
seeds that are expected to grow waist-high by fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven-year-old Alex Berlin studied the two holes punched on both sides of his 
milk carton, and pushed a twig through to create a perch for the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeder, Alex said, would "keep the birds healthy and feed them so they 
don't, like, starve." 
</P>
<P>
 These were just a few of the many school-sponsored activities across Ventura 
County that marked Earth Day, the annual celebration that began in 1970 to 
increase awareness of the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County cities and the county have planned more activities for today, 
including a special children's booth at the Conejo Valley Days in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to integrate this environmental ethic into the kids when they're 
young," said Becky Radonich, recycling coordinator for the city of Camarillo. 
Radonich, who visited Los Nogales School on Friday, said, "Kids are an 
extremely effective method of bringing the values home to parents." 
</P>
<P>
 And children remember the lessons best when they learn them through the kinds 
of hands-on events that occur on Earth Day, said Carol Boysen, who teaches a 
fourth-, fifth- and sixth-grade bilingual class at Fred Williams School. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that kids think about what they can do to take a personal part 
in preserving the ocean and the environment," Boysen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students researched sea animals and then helped create the large cardboard 
characters that danced across the stage Friday during a presentation of the 
play "Sam the Clam." 
</P>
<P>
 When the play opens, Sam is a happy clam at the bottom of the ocean, listening 
to all his friends above him chattering and swimming. But as pollution worsens, 
Gail the Whale, Sheryl the Shrimp, Tommy Turtle and Carol the Crab begin to 
disappear, making Sam very sad. 
</P>
<P>
 When children clean the beach, Sam is happy again and his friends return. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned a lot about things and how we have to take care of beaches and 
pick up trash and not kill fishes and save the coral reef," said Cesar Lopez, 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fred Williams School, students in MacLeod's class got a refresher course on 
the importance of recycling by Marcy Sanchez of Gold Coast Recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, who had been on a tour of the recycling facility earlier this 
month, discussed how they might recycle even more than they did this past week. 
</P>
<P>
 They decided to take old T-shirts and refashion them as reusable shopping bags 
for Mother's Day presents. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the students, Blake Smith, came up with the idea, so we all got all 
excited about it," MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
 During lunch and recess at Madrona School in Thousand Oaks, students swarmed 
around a picnic table piled with milk cartons, twigs saved from yard clippings, 
small bags full of birdseed and paper clips. 
</P>
<P>
 First-grader Jann Nielsen said she thought her bird feeder would attract blue 
jays and robins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to put a list of names of girls and a list of names of boys on the 
feeder," she said. "I'm going to name all the birds that come and eat at my 
feeder." 
</P>
<P>
 Kat Seiple, a mother who helped organize the project, said the project was 
chosen in part to teach children that birds help the environment by spreading 
seeds and by eating insects, reducing the need for pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect one day to make a difference for the earth, but we'd like 
this to be a spring for the kids," she said. "It helps them see that all these 
things aren't garbage."

OXNARD TO STUDY SHIFT IN SMOKING REGULATIONS; HEALTH: OFFICIALS AGREE ON NEED 
TO REVIEW THEIR LAW AFTER NEARBY JURISDICTIONS TOUGHEN LIMITS, BUT HAVE NOT 
FORMULATED ANY CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An anti-smoking campaign that has swept across Ventura County will arrive 
Tuesday in Oxnard, where leaders of the business-friendly city say they will 
weigh health concerns against the potential for harming small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council will consider revising the city's 6-year-old smoking 
law, which allows employers to decide whether their workers can light up. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing ordinance prohibits smoking in office restrooms, lounges and 
receptions areas, but does not regulate smoking in restaurants, stores and 
other establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Following adoption of tough no-smoking laws in other Ventura County cities, 
Oxnard officials agreed on the need to review their law, but have yet to 
formulate any suggested changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Health advocates are lobbying for more restrictive regulations, while smokers' 
rights advocates are urging city leaders to leave the ordinance unchanged. Some 
council members say they haven't decided whether further restrictions are 
needed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Health is a very important concern," said Councilman Andres Herrera, a former 
smoker who kicked the habit about nine years ago. "But it's also important that 
we don't jeopardize the health of the entities that provide employment and 
provide an economic base for us as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tom Holden, who gave up smoking eight years ago, said he has 
received about a dozen calls from residents opposed to changing the existing 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel people should be protected from the effects of secondhand smoke, but I 
also have a concern for freedom of choice," he said. "I think it's time to 
listen to the residents and business owners, and hear what they have to say." 
</P>
<P>
 In cities where the issue has already been decided, residents and business 
owners have had plenty to say. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 Camarillo residents packed a public hearing last week while city 
officials were considering new no-smoking laws. Following the four-hour 
hearing, the Camarillo City Council adopted an ordinance that bans smoking in 
most public places, including all restaurants and most other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, Thousand Oaks, Ojai and Moorpark, along with unincorporated parts of 
Ventura County, have all adopted similar laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Of cities lobbied by the Smoking Action Coalition of Ventura County to enact 
new laws, only Simi Valley has declined to toughen its smoking ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, formed in 1987, is made up of the executive directors and 
members of the Ventura County medical and dental societies and the Ventura 
County chapters of the heart, lung and cancer societies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez ordered review of the city's smoking 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 A report prepared by city staff members detailed the efforts by other cities 
to regulate smoking. The staff report made no recommendations, but asked for 
City Council guidance on what restrictions, if any, would be best. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez could not be reached Friday for comment. But in an interview last week, 
he said he favored revising the no-smoking law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm leaning toward supporting an ordinance that would provide real 
protections against secondhand smoke," he said. "The evidence is in, and I 
think it's clear what kind of danger that secondhand smoke presents to 
nonsmokers." 
</P>
<P>
 But business leaders said Friday that they are worried that tough new 
regulations will drive customers away from restaurants and other small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are always concerned about any undue restrictions on business," said Don 
Facciano, executive director of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce. "Most people 
forget, we have an ordinance already and it seems to be working."

EX-JURIST CRITICIZES D.A. FOR DISQUALIFYING JUDGE; COURTS: ROBERT R. WILLARD, 
RETIRED FROM BENCH, CALLS REMOVAL OF LAWRENCE STORCH FROM CRIMINAL CASES 
'SELFISH AND CHILDISH.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury "has gone too far" in disqualifying Ventura 
County's longest-serving Superior Court judge from criminal cases, a retired 
judge charged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a selfish and childish reaction," retired Superior Court Judge Robert 
R. Willard said in a letter to The Times that accuses Bradbury of "judge 
shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 The 82-year-old Willard, who served nearly 20 years on the bench before 
retiring in 1981, is one of the few judges -- active or retired -- to speak out 
against Bradbury for banning Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch from criminal 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury's office on Tuesday ordered deputy prosecutors to use a rare legal 
challenge to systematically disqualify Storch from hearing new criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the order, the 20-year jurist will probably be transferred to 
civil cases once his current criminal caseload is completed. Storch is one of 
six judges in the Superior Court's criminal section. 
</P>
<P>
 The edict against Storch followed his decision to reduce a Newbury Park man's 
first-degree murder conviction to second-degree murder and sentence the 
defendant to the lowest possible prison term. Storch said the evidence did not 
support the first-degree conviction, and later noted that Bradbury's office had 
originally been willing to accept a guilty plea to the lesser charge of 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday, Willard said he went public on the issue because "Mike 
Bradbury is wrong that Storch is not completely competent and fair." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to say in response to the letter," the district attorney said. 
"We don't intend to discuss the matter any further." 
</P>
<P>
 But one of Bradbury's deputy district attorneys said Willard was soft on crime 
as a judge and has no room to criticize the county's top prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very unpleasant and painful to be a trial attorney in his courtroom," 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes said of Willard. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Willard, a 15-year city attorney for Ojai before then-Gov. 
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown appointed him to the Superior Court in 1964, said in his 
letter that Bradbury "suffers from a glaring weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 "He cannot stand to lose," he said. "He flies into an emotional pique and 
seeks to disqualify a highly qualified judge for the sole reason that the 
judge, in all good conscience, does not agree with him." 
</P>
<P>
 He accused Bradbury of "blackballing" judges who have not agreed with him in 
the past, a practice that Willard said interfered with the administration of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty-five years ago, Ventura County Deputy District Attorney Bradbury was 
young, competent, eager, and a gentlemen," Willard wrote. "It is regrettable 
that the power he achieved has changed him so much. Ventura County is no longer 
well served." 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Willard said he believes many current Ventura County judges 
have not spoken out against the district attorney because a number of them are 
former prosecutors who used to work under Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see why the judges there would not want to antagonize the district 
attorney, or get into a battle with him, just as Judge Storch hasn't," Willard 
said. "Being retired, I don't have any concerns. If I were trying cases 
regularly, I might. I might be disqualified for saying what I am saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, either side in a case gets one chance to remove a judge when 
the case is first assigned, without stating a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 As a judge, Willard was disqualified several times on individual criminal 
cases. But he was never subjected to the systematic disqualification that the 
district attorney has initiated against Storch. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Holmes said he kept Willard off certain cases by filing an 
affidavit disqualifying him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had done it more often," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard gave probation to a drunk-driving defendant who had been convicted of 
vehicular manslaughter in a crash that took the life of a young girl returning 
from a 4-H meeting, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury even recommended that he go to state prison," Holmes said. "But 
Willard placed him on probation." 
</P>
<P>
 Willard was challenged for his judicial seat in 1978 by Deputy Dist. Atty. O. 
Guy Frick, who is now second-in-command of Bradbury's child support unit. Frick 
campaigned on a law-and-order platform, accusing Willard of handing down light 
sentences.  
</P>
<P>
 But voters returned Willard to office. 
</P>
<P>
 Frick could not be reached for comment on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch will continue to hear criminal cases assigned to his court before 
Bradbury's decision to disqualify him -- cases that could take several months 
to resolve. On Monday, he is scheduled to sentence Christopher Sattiewhite of 
Oxnard for murdering a woman in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury ordered the death penalty, but Storch will consider a defense motion 
to reduce the sentence to life in prison without possibility of parole.

SCATTERED SHOWERS TO THE COUNTY BUT THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE LIGHT.

 The brunt of a Pacific storm will pass Ventura County by this weekend, leaving 
overcast skies and some scattered showers but not the heavy rainfall originally 
predicted, meteorologists said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain could begin by this evening and continue into Sunday, with 
accumulations of up to a quarter of an inch along the coast and half an inch in 
the inland areas, forecasters said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The heavy precipitation doesn't look like it's coming" to the county, said 
Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData, Inc., which forecasts for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the storm system will be concentrated in Northern and Central 
California, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the amount of rain expected is less than originally predicted by some 
forecasters, it is still unusual for this late in the season. The record 
rainfall for April 24 -- the date when this weekend's rainfall is predicted -- 
is only one-tenth of an inch, recorded in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren said if the storm does bring half an inch of rain to parts of the 
county, "that would be an unusually wet system for this late in the season." 
</P>
<P>
 The weather should be unseasonably cool as well as damp, Thoren said. Cold air 
from the Gulf of Alaska, where the storm system started, should bring a chill 
to the air, dropping temperatures into the 40s by Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Fujii, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Oxnard, said 
average temperatures for the county this time of year are normally in the 60s 
or low 70s, with nighttime lows around 55 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow levels in the Northern Sierra could drop as low as 3,000 feet, Fujii 
said. The Santa Barbara Mountains might see a slight dusting on Sunday, he 
said, if snow levels dip to 5,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers for Ventura's California Beach Party, which starts today and 
continues through Sunday, said rumors about the predicted storm had been flying 
through the office all day Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the party will go on, rain or shine, according to event coordinator Faye 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather report keeps changing," Campbell said. "We expect to get either 
two half-good days or one good day. If anybody stays home they're going to miss 
a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said it has never rained on the beach party in its eight-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren said skies should be sunny this morning and during the early afternoon, 
with clouds rolling in during the late afternoon. High temperatures should be 
in the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday is likely to be overcast, he said, with chances for sporadic showers 
throughout the day. Temperatures should be in the upper 50s to mid-60s during 
the day, dipping into the 40s in the evening.

<P>
 A 2-year-old Oxnard girl running to an ice cream vendor's truck was struck by 
a car and killed Friday night in Oxnard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley Mendez darted out from between two cars on Fournier Street just as Cas 
Dominguez, 27, was driving by. Dominguez stopped the car and began to give 
first aid to the girl. She was taken by ambulance to St. John's Regional 
Medical Center, where she died from her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez was driving within the speed limit, according to witnesses, and 
police do not anticipate an arrest, Oxnard Police Cmdr. Jeff Young said. "It 
doesn't appear that there was anything he could have done." MARY F. POLS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MORE CHARGES ISSUED IN BANK FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury has brought additional charges against a Ventura man 
accused of conspiring to swindle several banks and private investors out of 
nearly $3 million, the FBI reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Michael Downey, 42, will face nine felony counts for his alleged 
involvement in a real estate scheme that began in October, 1989, and continued 
until June, 1992, under a new indictment handed up Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey, who operated a mortgage brokerage, Sunwest Pacific Mortgage Services 
in Ventura, was arrested earlier this month and charged with bank fraud. He is 
accused of working with a Fresno couple to obtain loans of $2.45 million from 
two Southern California banks using falsified income tax returns, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, William Frederick Williams and Mary Craig Williams, were arrested 
earlier this month. William Williams pleaded guilty to six counts of bank fraud 
and charges against his wife were dropped as part of a plea agreement with 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The new charges against Downey accuse him of falsifying loan applications, 
disclosure statements, trust deeds and other documents during five other 
transactions, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, Downey applied for several loans, including one 
of $150,000 on property in Santa Paula and another of $12,000 for property in 
Moreno Valley near Riverside, without telling the lender about prior property 
liens. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also accused of applying for a $132,000 loan on a Ventura property 
without disclosing to lenders that the parcel was landlocked and had no access 
to public streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey is scheduled to stand trial on May 31 in U. S. District Court in Los 
Angeles. MARY F. POLS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL TO LOOK AT ECONOMIC GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura City Council members will consider four options Monday night on how 
they can better identify their economic goals and objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 The council wants to hire a consultant to suggest ways to recharge the city's 
economy by attracting new businesses to Ventura.But first, some council members 
said, the council needs to agree on what kind of economy it would like to have. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members will present four ways on how the council can prepare to 
meet with a consultant: 
</P>
<P>
 * The council can ask another city or cities with experience in establishing 
an economic development program to allow their staff members to meet with 
Ventura's staff and council members. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city could enlist the help of the California Local Economic Development 
Assn., a nonprofit, Sacramento-based group that provides communities with 
professional advice on how to achieve economic objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 * The council could hire a preliminary consultant to prepare for the more 
permanent consultant the city plans to enlist. 
</P>
<P>
 * The council could ask city staff members to write a policy statement on 
proposed economic goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager has advised council members, however, not to choose the 
fourth option because he does not believe city staff members have the proper 
expertise for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring the nonprofit group would cost the city about $500, City Manager John 
Baker said. Bringing in staff members from other cities would probably only be 
the cost of their transportation, he said. Baker said he did not yet know how 
much a consultant might cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said he would like more discussion of the city's economic 
goals before the council hires a development coordinator.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need to better identify what our goals and objectives are," Buford said. 
"We really have different ideas and perspectives on what should be done."

CHP OFFICER GIVES NEW TESTIMONY IN KING CASE; COURTS: POWELL SAID THE BEATING 
TIRED HIM OUT, THE JURY IS TOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after Rodney G. King was beaten in Lake View Terrace, the officer 
responsible for delivering most of the blows said, "You know, I tired myself 
out hitting that guy," a California Highway Patrol officer testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time CHP Officer Timothy Singer had told a jury about 
Laurence M. Powell's comment after the beating. Singer had testified in the 
state court trial of Powell and three other officers accused in the beating but 
did not discuss the words they had exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said Friday that Powell made the comment during a conversation in the 
lobby of Pacifica Hospital, where King was taken for initial treatment of his 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Are you LAPD's designated hitter or what?' " Singer recalled.  
</P>
<P>
 "And what did Officer Powell say?" asked Federico Sayre, an attorney for King. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You know, I tired myself out hitting that guy,' " Singer quoted Powell as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer was one of four witnesses called by King's attorneys Friday to testify 
during the punitive-damages phase of the trial against 15 defendants, including 
the four former Los Angeles Police Department officers originally charged in 
the beating and former Chief Daryl F. Gates. The witnesses put Powell and 
Stacey C. Koon at the center of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon was identified as the supervising sergeant at the scene of the beating 
and was said to have used a Taser gun to subdue King. Powell was said to have 
struck King the most times with his baton. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were convicted in federal court last year of violating King's civil 
rights and are serving 30-month prison sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer and his wife and CHP partner, Melanie Singer, were the first officers 
to chase King's speeding car March 3, 1991. Both Singers testified that they 
saw King being hit repeatedly in the head by Powell, who was in court listening 
to the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Melanie Singer testified that Koon arrived at the scene and took 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Powell, on hand for the testimony, said he never aimed for 
King's head. Most of King's injuries were from a fall he took after he was 
shocked with a Taser gun, they maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, former Officer Timothy E. Wind concluded testimony about his role in 
the beating. He said that while officers were attempting to subdue King, he 
heard Koon shout, "Hit him! Hit him!" 
</P>
<P>
 Wind was acquitted along with former Officer Theodore J. Briseno in both 
criminal trials. Koon and Powell, although later convicted in federal court of 
violating King's civil rights, were also acquitted in the state trial. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of the first phase of the current trial earlier this week, 
jurors ordered the city of Los Angeles to pay King $3.8 million in compensatory 
damages.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; MTA 
URGED TO KEEP TRANSIT POLICE JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county transit police force got another morale boost Friday when a 
committee recommended keeping the status quo, with sheriff's deputies 
patrolling one line and transit police handling everything else.  
</P>
<P>
 At a special meeting of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Executive 
Management Committee, panelists voted unanimously to recommend retaining the 
MTA transit police for its security needs, said MTA spokesman Steve Chesser.The 
full MTA board will take up the issue at its April 27 monthly meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The management committee also urged the MTA board to expand the MTA police 
force to provide security when the east-west Metro Green Line opens next year.  
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has a contract with the Sheriff's Department for law enforcement on 
the Metro Blue Line, the first of the agency's ambitious schedule of rail 
projects. That contract expires June 30, and the management committee 
recommended today that the MTA study other options before renewing it, Chesser 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The MTA is trying to decide whether to keep the MTA police or go with a joint 
sheriff's and Los Angeles Police Department force. The stakes are high: The 
10-year contract could be worth nearly $1 billion.

OFFICER GIVES NEW TESTIMONY IN KING BEATING; COURTS: LAURENCE M. POWELL SAID HE 
TIRED HIMSELF OUT HITTING PLAINTIFF, ACCORDING TO HIGHWAY PATROLMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As Rodney G. King lay in a hospital after his beating, the policeman who had 
struck the most blows commented, "You know, I tired myself out hitting that 
guy," a highway patrolman testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The remark by former Police Officer Laurence M. Powell was related by 
California Highway Patrol Officer Timothy Singer, who said he started the 
conversation by asking Powell, "Are you LAPD's designated hitter or what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Singer, testifying in King's civil suit against Los Angeles Police Department 
officers who clubbed him, testified in two previous King trials but has never 
before related this conversation with Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, who is serving a 30-month prison sentence for violating King's civil 
rights, was in court listening as Singer testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer and his wife and CHP partner, Melanie Singer, began the March 3, 1991, 
freeway chase of King's speeding car that ended in the videotaped beating which 
reverberated around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Singers have said the LAPD wrested control of the situation from them and 
told them to back off. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Singer recalled Friday how King staggered after he was hit with an 
electronic stun gun and how Powell "stepped forward into Mr. King's path and 
struck him." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked where the blow landed, he said, "It struck Mr. King on the right side of 
his head above the ear." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the second blow landed on King's jaw and that Powell continued to 
pummel the motorist. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Mr. King hit the ground, did you see Mr. Powell continue to strike him 
in the head?" asked one of King's attorneys, Frederico Sayre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Singer said. "As I recall, there was no cessation." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell has said that he never aimed for King's head, a forbidden technique, 
and that he believes only one deflected blow hit the motorist's face. Powell's 
lawyer contends that King broke his facial bones falling on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer testified that he felt some fear at the beating scene, but Melanie 
Singer, who followed him to the stand, said, "I don't think it was fear that I 
was feeling. . . . I don't think fear crossed my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 She also testified that she saw King fall and that "his face did not hit the 
pavement." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a question by Sayre, she said she saw LAPD officers using 
unnecessary force. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the trial recessed for the weekend, the King legal team called two more 
bystander officers, Ingrid Braun and Rolando Solano, who said they saw no 
misconduct and heard no racial slurs during the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said in previous trials that King appeared to be under the influence of 
the drug PCP. Timothy Singer was asked in court Friday if he shared that 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't cross my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the beaten King was taken to Pacifica Hospital, Singer said he went there 
and confronted Powell in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Are you LAPD's designated hitter or what?' " he recalled. "I said 
that because Officer Powell was the only LAPD officer I saw in that large group 
striking Mr. King." 
</P>
<P>
 "And what did Officer Powell say?" Sayre asked. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You know, I tired myself out hitting that guy,' " he quoted Powell as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 In the punitive damage phase of King's civil trial, his lawyers are trying to 
place blame on 15 individuals, including the four officers originally charged 
in the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors, who already have assessed $3.8 million in compensatory damages, are 
being asked to give King more money as punishment to his assailants and to 
prevent recurrence of such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Friday, one of the defendants, former LAPD Officer Timothy Wind, said 
he never questioned a sergeant's order to hit King because he had been taught 
that "sergeants . . . get the big bucks and you follow their orders and think 
about it later."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; MERCHANTS CASH IN ON TENNIS TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the 1,600 competitors in the Ojai Valley tennis tournament adjust their 
racket strings and stretch their muscles in anticipation of weekend matches, 
local merchants are warming up for their own kind of competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Cashing in on tourist sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a poor man's sport," said Ojai Ice Cream owner Doug Rydbeck, whose 
small downtown store was crammed with players and spectators Thursday, the 
first day of the four-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's twice as busy," he said. "Because the whole enclave is across the 
street, it's good for the downtown merchants." 
</P>
<P>
 In its 95th year, "The Ojai," as it is commonly known, is the oldest amateur 
tennis tournament in the country. It is also a major source of 
tourist-generated income for local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rydbeck and other merchants in Ojai's arcade shopping area rely on the hordes 
of visitors who wander from Libbey Park's tennis courts to their nearby food 
and clothes shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes us happy," said Andrea Bloom, owner of Tottenham Court Ltd., an 
English tea room and boutique. Bloom said her business sales increase about 20% 
during events like the tennis tournament and Ojai Music Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Westrom, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, said that 
much of Ojai's tourist base is generated by these events. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's so positive about it for our businesses is (visitors) see Ojai and 
come back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai City Manager Andrew Belknap agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ojai relies on a fairly large degree on visitor revenue," he said. "This 
event and other events are a part of that. It does shape the economy here." 
</P>
<P>
 While the GTE West Classic golf tournament is the largest event in Ojai, the 
tennis tournament lures more people into downtown stores because of its central 
location in Libbey Park, Belknap said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Cafe Emporium owner Barbara McCarthy, whose restaurant is only a backhand 
shot away from the park, was scrambling Thursday to open a new addition to her 
establishment before the tennis crowds disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Her breakfast muffins and fresh-squeezed orange juice were popular with the 
health-conscious players who frequented her establishment throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely has added to our customer base," McCarthy said of the 
tournament. "They're a muffin bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in visitors typically causes a rise in traffic congestion, and 
this year's event was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Two road projects slowed traffic to a crawl through much of the downtown area, 
forcing some residents to find other modes of transportation Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traffic is bad, but I just walked down," said Phyllis Quimby, who has 
watched the tournament for 40 years. "I just love to watch good tennis and see 
up-and-coming players." TRACY WILSON

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
LARGE LOAD OF '3 STRIKES' CASES FILED BY PROSECUTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first six weeks of the state's "three strikes" law, Los Angeles County 
prosecutors filed 152 "third strike" felony cases and 489 "second strike" 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, attorneys and judges believe the caseload could 
overload the county's legal system by crowding out civil trials and filling up 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
 "Innocent people seeking redress in the courts will be shunted aside because 
the courts are filled with 'three strikes' cases," Bruce Broillet, Los Angeles 
Trial Lawyers Assn. president, said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" law mandates a sentence of 25 years to life in prison for 
third-time felons previously convicted of two previous serious or violent 
crimes.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLLYWOOD; PLASTIC 
FREEWAY WALL DESIGNED TO RESIST GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plastic sound wall on the southbound Hollywood Freeway will help the 
California Department of Transportation reduce its $3-million graffiti cleanup 
bill in the county, an official said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The $55,000 wall at Melrose Avenue is 210 feet long, made of recycled plastic 
and has an "easy cleaning feature," said Caltrans District 7 Director Jerry 
Baxter.It is the second graffiti-resistant sound wall in the Southland. The 
other is on the northbound Santa Ana Freeway off-ramp at Grand Avenue. If the 
wall passes a year of performance evaluations, Baxter said, Caltrans may 
install similar barriers on freeways around the state.  
</P>
<P>
 The recycled plastic sound walls dampen freeway noise, have a surface that 
allows graffiti to be easily wiped off with a rag and solvent and allow for 
carvings to be filled in, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recycled plastic is employed widely in Europe. It also is used for 
benches, picnic tables, planters and playground equipment. The walls are made 
of discarded plastic ground into plastic chips at recycling centers, then 
pressed into plastic "lumber," resembling redwood or cedar.

 Three teen-agers suspected of stealing a Lincoln Towncar in El Rio on Friday 
crashed it on the Ventura Freeway in Camarillo two hours later and were 
arrested on a runway at Camarillo Airport as they tried to flee, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car broke through the fence on the Ventura Freeway, south of Las Posas 
Road, about 12:20 p.m. and flipped onto its roof on a frontage road, California 
Highway Patrol Officer Curt Rhyne said.Officers responding to the accident saw 
three teen-agers running from the car toward the airport, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently they had stolen the car two hours before that," said Rhyne, who 
was one of the first officers at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio crossed a field, jumped a fence and went through a ditch before 
running onto an abandoned section of a runway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were out of breath when we caught them," Rhyne said. Airport security, 
sheriff's deputies and CHP officers converged on the trio at the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers, all from El Rio, are 14, 15 and 17. Their names are not being 
released because of their ages. They are being held at Juvenile Hall on 
suspicion of car theft, possession of stolen property, driving without a 
driver's license and walking on a prohibited area on a runway. PEGGY Y. LEE

 Ventura police found a bogus pipe bomb in a trash can after a threat was 
called into Buena High School, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man telephoned the school about 1:25 p.m. Thursday and said a bomb was set 
to go off within the hour, said Ventura Police Officer Robin Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
 Police searched the high school for about 90 minutes, Dawson said, before 
"security guards found a funny-looking pipe inside a trash can in the 
schoolyard." 
</P>
<P>
 As students left their classes about 3 p.m., they were rerouted away from the 
trash can while a robot safely removed the pipe, which had tape on the ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out to be zippo," Dawson said. PEGGY Y. LEE

 A 21-year-old El Rio man was stabbed several times in the chest while sitting 
in a car with a friend in the 2000 block of Balboa Street in El Rio, 
authorities said Friday.

<P>
 Donald Alfred Reyes was in stable condition at St. John's Regional Medical

 Reyes was sitting in the car in the residential neighborhood about 2:30 p.m. 
Thursday when a man dressed in a black sweat shirt and black pants came up to 
Reyes, reached in the window and stabbed him repeatedly, said Ventura County 
Sheriff's Detective Raul Munoz.

 "As strange as it appears, that's what happened," Munoz said. "We're trying to

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COURT SAYS RESIDENTS CAN SUE OVER SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of the Oxnard Dunes subdivision who installed signs on their houses 
protesting a nearby toxic dump can sue the city for allowing neighbors to 
destroy the signs, according to a ruling Friday by a federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th District Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled 3 to 0 to 
reinstate a lawsuit previously dismissed by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling said the residents, Lynda Paxton and Stephen Blanchard, may be able 
to show that their constitutional rights were violated when two Oxnard 
policemen stood by and watched as neighbors took a chain saw to the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the Paxton family asked the police to intervene and one of the 
officers announced that Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig had instructed the 
subdivision's homeowners association that it could enforce longtime 
restrictions against signs, said Kate Neiswender, the lawyer representing 
Paxton and Blanchard.  
</P>
<P>
 "The court has given me a cause of action against the Police Department and 
Gary Gillig," Neiswender said. "I'll definitely go forward with the suit right 
away. We're going to get as much money as we possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillig was unavailable for comment Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs, which read "TOXIC," "Our Home Toxic Dump" and "Oxnard's Own Love 
Canal," were erected in 1990 as part of a long-running dispute between 
residents of the subdivision, called the Oxnard Dunes, and the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents sued the city after learning about oil-drilling wastes buried 
beneath the sand near the subdivision. About 175 residents settled with the 
city, but several, including Paxton and Blanchard, went to trial and lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The city brought charges against Paxton and Blanchard for putting up signs 
illegally, but the charges were later dismissed. MARY F. POLS

EX-OFFICIAL PLEADS NO CONTEST IN MISSPENDING CASE; COURTS: FORMER BRADBURY CITY 
MANAGER AGREES TO PAY RESTITUTION IN EXCHANGE FOR HAVING FOUR OTHER FELONY 
COUNTS DROPPED. SHE COULD GET A TWO-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Bradbury city manager who used the town's credit card to ring up tens 
of thousands of dollars on personal luxuries such as fine china and designer 
sunglasses pleaded no contest Friday to felony charges of misspending public 
money and falsifying documents to conceal her actions. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a bargain struck with the district attorney's office, Aurora 
(Dolly) Vollaire agreed to pay the city $53,462.11 in restitution. In exchange, 
the district attorney's office has dropped four other felony counts against 
Vollaire, who could be sentenced to up to two years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm satisfied with the plea bargain -- she has saved taxpayers further grief 
by admitting to her crime," Bradbury Mayor Beatrice LaPisto-Kirtley said. "The 
money she's paying back will go directly into the city budget and help pay for 
services." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vollaire's attorney, Rayford Fountain, said he will ask the judge for a 
sentence that would not involve a jail term but require community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Vollaire's) mental health is not good and she is under the care of a mental 
health provider," Fountain said. "She's depressed and emotionally shattered, 
and I don't think she could have stood the stress of a protracted trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol J. Straughn said the restitution represents the 
amount she and investigators felt they could easily prove was misspent by 
Vollaire over the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relieved. Going through all the records and receipts -- back to 1983 -- 
was a massive amount of work," Straughn said. "I only went back four years 
because the bulk of the expenditures occurred within that time. We had to 
contact store owners as far away as the Virgin Islands." 
</P>
<P>
 Money for the restitution will be taken from the estimated $85,000 Vollaire 
has accumulated in a retirement account held by the city of Bradbury, an 
affluent San Gabriel Valley enclave of 938 residents where Vollaire worked for 
two decades before she was fired last spring for the misspending. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported last year that Vollaire misspent thousands of dollars on 
personal items. City records contained a host of cut and altered receipts for 
Vollaire's purchases, but some bore the insignia of boutiques and upscale 
department stores such as Bullock's, Tiffany's and Saks, and included items 
from designer dresses to red shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six counts filed against Vollaire in January, the district attorney's 
office dropped charges of grand theft, embezzlement by a public officer, 
keeping false accounts of public money and falsification and concealment of 
public records. Had she been charged with all six counts, Vollaire, 54, would 
have faced a maximum sentence of five years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollaire entered her pleas Friday morning in Los Angeles Municipal Court just 
before a date was to have been set for her preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 20, Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer, is scheduled to decide whether 
to admit Vollaire to a state prison for 90 days for an evaluation or order a 
recommendation on her punishment from the county Probation Department.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Vollaire, whose no contest plea means she is barred from 
holding public office, will remain free on her own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the criminal trial, the city of Bradbury has sued Vollaire for 
$84,000 in restitution, plus interest and punitive damages.

TEST OPPONENTS THREATENED WITH REMOVAL FROM OFFICE; EDUCATION: STATE WARNS THAT 
ANTELOPE VALLEY OFFICIALS WHO VOTED AGAINST CLAS EXAMS COULD BE DISMISSED. THEY 
SAY THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The state Department of Education has threatened to remove three members of 
the Antelope Valley school board who voted this week not to administer the 
department's controversial CLAS exams, the board's president said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Pricer said he was told by his attorney that if the district refuses to 
give the tests, the Department of Education might seek to convene a grand jury 
that could dismiss him as well as members Tony Welch and Sue Stokka from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're calling it inappropriate behavior for an elected official," Pricer 
said. "It just floors me because there's no substance to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Union High School District board voted 3 to 2 Wednesday 
not to administer the California Learning Assessment System tests in reading, 
writing and math to sophomores this spring. The 12,600-student district is the 
first in California to refuse to administer the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Department attorneys said the law mandates that all school districts in the 
state administer the CLAS test, an exam highly touted by education reformers 
but that has been harshly criticized by some conservatives as a violation of 
students' and parents' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't violated any laws," Pricer said. "We're not quite that stupid. I 
don't mind defying the state (Department of Education) but I'm not going to 
violate a legislated law." 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer contends the law does not specify that the CLAS test is the 
standardized assessment exam that must be given. "The decision is at the local 
level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS exams have come under fire from some parents and political groups who 
contend that the literature portions of the test contain passages that 
denigrate the family. Issues of secrecy have also raised concerns. The state 
Department of Education argues that access to the tests must be limited to 
ensure their integrity, while critics contend that the secrecy is to keep 
parents from knowing the contents of the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 William D. Dawson, acting state superintendent of public instruction, did not 
return calls seeking comment Friday. Department representatives said a formal 
response would probably be sent Monday to the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 William L. Rukeyser, a department spokesman, said renegade school districts 
could not decide for themselves whether to administer the expensive statewide 
CLAS test, given for the first time last year to about a million students in 
the 4th, 8th and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state Department of Education is not going to roll over on this issue," 
Rukeyser said. "It's an issue of vital importance to the state of California 
and the economy of California. The strength of the state's economy depends on a 
highly educated population and a trained work force." 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer said the Antelope Valley district's attorney, Frank J. Fekete, told him 
of the Department of Education's vow to seek the removal of board members. 
Fekete confirmed he had talked to Pricer but declined to divulge details. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that . . . (the Department of Education) are going to send a 
letter demanding we give the test," Pricer said. " If we do not, they may file 
a lawsuit. Their other option is they may file with the grand jury to have us 
forcibly removed from office." 
</P>
<P>
 Fekete said there is a little-used procedure in the law that allows a person 
to present charges to the district attorney for the removal of an elected 
official by a grand jury. The district attorney decides whether to present the 
charges to a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we have done is tried to challenge the validity of the test," said 
Pricer. "We are not trying to overthrow the government. What in the world are 
they afraid of?" 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Stokka said that if the department takes the matter to the 
district attorney it would only serve as proof of her argument that the state 
is trying to bully school districts over this test.

NO LANGUAGE BARRIER; COLLEGE BOARD TO OFFER FIRST TEST OF PROFICIENCY IN 
CHINESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By K. CONNIE KANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "It's nice to know that Chinese is finally being accepted," said Alhambra High 
School junior Gary Chen as he prepared to join more than 3,000 students 
nationwide on Tuesday in tackling the College Board's first test to measure 
proficiency in Mandarin Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen, 16, a Chinese American, has studied Mandarin at his school for the past 
three years. He will be among about 250 students from the heavily Asian 
Alhambra, Mark Keppel and San Gabriel high schools who will take the Chinese 
exam.  
</P>
<P>
 The one-hour Mandarin test is only the second on an Asian language to make the 
College Board's foreign language roster. Until last year, when Japanese was 
added, only French, Spanish, German, Italian, Latin and modern Hebrew had been 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
 L. Ling-chi Wang, a UC Berkeley professor and chairman of the UC Task Force on 
Asian Languages, says acceptance of the Mandarin test by the College Board is 
long overdue in view of the dramatic growth of the Asian American population 
and of U.S. interests with East Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of students taking Mandarin, the language spoken by a fifth of the 
world's people, increased by more than 50% between 1990 and 1993 in 
California's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are required for students seeking admission to many colleges. Although 
the University of California and other colleges require applicants to take 
English and math tests, students can choose their third exam, which can be in a 
foreign language. The achievement tests -- known as SAT II -- are used in 
making admission decisions and sometimes to place students in the correct 
course level. 
</P>
<P>
 The exclusion of Asian languages was ended in 1993 when the College Board, a 
consortium of schools and colleges formed in 1901 to offer college entrance 
exams, chose Japanese. The Japanese test was developed only after years of 
lobbying by the UC Task Force on Asian Languages and pressure from the 
California Legislature, according to Wang. 
</P>
<P>
 The big question now is whether to develop a test in Korean. People of Korean 
descent make up one of California's largest Asian population groups after 
Filipinos, Chinese and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 College Board President Donald Stewart today will address a statewide 
conference on Asian languages in Pasadena and later will meet with Asian 
American scholars and Korean community leaders in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've invited him to Los Angeles so he can see for himself the size of the 
Korean American community," said Edward Chang, a UC Riverside professor and a 
member of the UC task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang said there is a dispute over what was promised by the College Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had assumed all along that the agreement in 1991 was for four languages -- 
Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese," Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brian O'Reilly, the board's director of operations and development, said 
the only thing the College Board agreed to was "to take on the development of 
tests in appropriate Asian languages." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Reilly acknowledged, however, that there is considerable interest around the 
country in including Korean. "We are working hard to come up with funding" to 
study the possibility of developing a Korean test, he said, but no timetable 
has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Vietnamese, there has not been the same level of interest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Reilly said developing a Korean test would be "a complete departure" from 
the College Board's policy because Korean is taught in only a few U.S. high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a Koreatown news conference this week, Asian American educators said 
about 30,000 youngsters of Korean ancestry attend more than 1,000 community and 
church-related schools nationwide after school and on weekends because only 
four public schools in the country offer the language. The students should be 
able to pursue their interests, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oftentimes the College Board . . . doesn't understand the realities of the 
Asian American community," Don Nakanishi, director of the UCLA Asian American 
Studies Center, told the news conference. "The College Board should get out of 
its East Coast perspective," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Reilly called Nakanishi's remark unfair. "We have offices in San Jose," he 
said. "It's not fair any longer to say that we're Eurocentric. We have two 
tests (in Asian languages)." 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra High School sophomore Jennifer Sun, 16, who will be taking the 
Mandarin test, said she is thankful that "a lot of people worked hard" to make 
it possible for her to take the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very exciting," said Sally Chao, Alhambra High assistant principal. 
"When I was going to high school, I was envious of the kids who spoke Spanish 
and French and could take the test."

AL MARTINEZ: TAKING BACK THE OLD 'HOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The area south of Downtown is one that many try to avoid. They'll tell you 
that gangs and drugs flourish there, that graffiti stain its walls and rubbish 
mars its streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I say things are changing in one of L.A.'s oldest neighborhoods. All 
those elements of violence and despair are on their way out, and when they're 
finally gone forever, you'll be able to say it all began on 23rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking about an area that stretches from Washington to Adams boulevards 
and from Figueroa to Hoover streets, a mixture of stores, apartments and grand 
Victorians that have weathered many eras. 
</P>
<P>
 On a Thomas Bros. map, it occupies a tiny southwest corner of the Downtown 
square, a barely noticeable speck in the vastness of a city that sprawls in all 
directions at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many once safe and flourishing sections of L.A., the neighborhood 
began to deteriorate under the weight of crime and poverty, and for a couple of 
decades indeed seemed a place to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Patsy Carter came along. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a tall, blond woman of 56 with blazing blue eyes and an ability to 
organize that has neighbors up at 3 a.m. painting over graffiti, and police 
paying close attention to what she says. 
</P>
<P>
 A former lawyer, she moved to West 23rd a dozen years ago, brushed aside the 
fear that was a palpable presence on her street and opened a bed and breakfast 
business in what was then the unlikeliest place in town. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inn at 657 was her dream come true, but turning dreams into reality is 
risky stuff. She chose the area because land was cheap, but it was that way for 
a reason Carter didn't like. So she set about to change it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What we had to do first was clean the place up," she said the other day in 
her apartment at the inn. It's an airy, immaculately kept building with lush 
gardens in full bloom. The colors of spring gleam in the afternoon sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trash and graffiti send out messages that an area is open to evil, that we 
aren't watching and don't care. The junk had to be removed from the streets and 
graffiti from the walls and buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter saw her area as a working-class, predominantly Latino neighborhood, but 
couldn't believe that they didn't care about their environment. So she 
organized them into the 23rd Street Neighbors, alerted the police they were in 
business and went to war. 
</P>
<P>
 The first problem, Carter felt, was to get rid of the graffiti that, when she 
moved in, covered half the buildings. It wasn't enough to simply paint over 
them once. Taggers are persistent. Names and gang symbols kept reappearing. But 
when they did, the 23rd Street Neighbors would just paint them out again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a war," Carter says. "We'd take a fence the way you take a hill in 
battle, and then we'd keep it, even when it meant meeting at 3 a.m. to protect 
it. When we conquered the fence, we'd move on to a wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city was being lobbied to keep the streets of their 
neighborhood clean, and when Caltrans ignored a request to tidy up a freeway 
off-ramp in their area, the 23rd Streeters did it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "About eight of us trimmed the bushes and picked up all of the needles and 
stuff that was there," Carter says. "A petty official at Caltrans was furious. 
He said it was his off-ramp and not to do it again. I said, 'So, arrest me. 
I'll call the L.A. Times.' I never heard from him again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an amazing person," Sgt. Don Linfield says. He's head of the LAPD's 
Southwest Division community policing unit. "Without her, there would be no 
neighborhood. It has improved significantly. Crime is way down. You can walk 
the streets now and not be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter believes, as does Linfield, that community organizations must work 
closely with the police to improve their areas. The more she got to know the 
officers, the more she became convinced their morale suffered from lack of a 
contract with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 She began a letter-writing campaign urging that the matter be settled 
forthwith. In the process, she brought other neighborhood associations together 
for the same purpose and organized them into the L.A. Citizens Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the purpose of the congress has broadened to include a general war 
on blight and crime, and a determination to fight them both the way the 23rd 
Street Neighbors are fighting them. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea isn't new. Community associations have been trying for years to 
improve their areas. But most of their effort, as Linfield points out, has 
involved talk and no action. 
</P>
<P>
 A tough and determined woman, Patsy Carter brought action to her neighborhood, 
and now, like the flowers at her inn, West 23rd Street blooms with new hope. 
It's a damned shame she isn't an army.

FAKE QUAKE TO HELP PINPOINT NEEDED ROYCE HALL REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in its 65 years as UCLA's showplace auditorium, people are 
hoping that the latest Royce Hall production does not bring down the house. 
</P>
<P>
 This one is no classical ballet or New Age jazz concert or high-brow stage 
show, however. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mock magnitude 4 earthquake designed to show structural engineers where 
emergency seismic repairs and retrofitting are needed most at the Romanesque 
performance hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers on Friday installed a one-of-a-kind shaking machine inside the 
heavily damaged building in hopes of causing the brick-and-concrete structure 
to vibrate enough to show which walls and floors will be most vulnerable in 
future earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of accelerometers and seismometers placed throughout the massive 
building will register its movement as a 10-foot spinner rotates at speeds of 
up to four revolutions per second. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they will carefully control the shaking to prevent further 
damage to the ornate, 1,850-seat auditorium or its six-story towers that form 
the architectural symbol of the Westwood campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a reality check on a computer model that has been done to 
predict how the building will perform in an earthquake," said Gary Hart, a 
civil engineering professor who designed the $70,000 shaking machine six years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A retrofitting and repair plan is being drawn up by Los Angeles structural 
engineer John Martin Jr. Although an emergency shoring of the towers has begun, 
major reconstruction is not expected to begin until the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's machine, which resembles a huge, one-bladed fan, produces 20,000 pounds 
of centrifugal force when a 7 1/2-horsepower electric motor sets it spinning. 
About a ton of weights can be added to the blade to create shaking levels up to 
that of a magnitude 5 quake. The effect is similar to that of a washing machine 
on spin cycle that is improperly loaded with soggy clothing and out of balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials decided to conduct the Royce Hall shaking test after structural 
engineers praised the value of Hart's machine in determining seismic 
strengthening needed for Los Angeles City Hall. It was used in secret tests a 
year ago to verify a computer-generated analysis of the Downtown tower's 
structural weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In those tests, the machine was attached to a concrete floor two stories 
beneath the City Hall tower observation platform. The shaking was done on a 
weekend when municipal offices were closed, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Few people are expected to be inside Royce Hall this afternoon when major 
testing is scheduled to take place. The machine is bolted to the concrete floor 
in the former office of Germanic languages department Chairman Ehrhard Bahr. 
His department's third-floor facilities in the east tower were badly damaged by 
the Jan. 17 quake and are partially supported by steel scaffolding. 
</P>
<P>
 During a shakedown test of the machine Friday afternoon, few people in 
undamaged offices at Royce Hall seemed to notice when Engineering Department 
technician John Langholff revved it up to two revolutions per second. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a buzz-saw-like whine from the electric motor, a whup-whup-whup 
sound from the spinning blade and a modest vibration that registered only 
slightly on Langholff's oscilloscope screens. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was enough to send Gordon Bradley, an assistant superintendent in 
charge of outside emergency repairs, running. He warned that columns supporting 
the towers are sheared off at the sixth floor and that bricks there could fall. 
</P>
<P>
 His workers could expect "a little shaking," Langholff told Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can assure them it's not an earthquake."

<P>
 March of Dimes officials expect a turnout of 800 walkers in Ventura County for 
this year's WalkAmerica for Healthier Babies fund-raiser, to be held in Simi 
Valley and Thousand Oaks today and in Ventura on April 30.  
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the annual fund-raiser, which has raised more than $611 
million since it began in 1970, is the largest and oldest walking event in the 
country.In Southern California, 15,000 people are expected to take part in the 
event by walking, running or roller-blading. 
</P>
<P>
 The money raised in the walk is used to combat congenital defects and infant 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will walk five miles in Thousand Oaks, starting at the North Creek 
Pavilion on Janss Road, and 10 miles in Simi Valley, beginning at Rancho Tapo 
Canyon Park today. Both walks begin at 8 a.m., and registrations will be taken 
until then. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura walk is scheduled for April 30 and will begin and end at Marina 
Harbor Village. Part of that route runs along the beach. Although the walk 
begins at 8 a.m., registrations will be accepted until 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's Ventura county walks raised $46,585, with 637 adults and children 
participating. Organizers hope to raise $60,000 in the county this year through 
pledges by sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 825,000 people are expected to participate across the country in 
this year's walk. Last year, walkers raised $56 million nationally.  
</P>
<P>

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CANDIDATE FINED FOR FALSE ADVERTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County Superior Court judge has ordered a candidate for county clerk 
to pay a $2,500 fine for falsely and deceptively advertising his business 
services, putting an end to a four-year legal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel J. Schmidt, a former Simi Valley resident, was charged in 1991 with 
wrongfully charging business owners for unnecessary services associated with 
refiling their business licenses.  
</P>
<P>
 The legal complaint was made by the district attorney's office on behalf of 
the county clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt ran his own legal advertising firm that published fictitious business 
names for business owners.  
</P>
<P>
 The complaint filed against him said Schmidt wrongly implied in flyers mailed 
to thousands of businesses that it was necessary to republish information when 
their licenses were renewed with the county clerk. Business licenses must be 
renewed every five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint also said that flyers mailed by Schmidt's California Legal 
Publication Office closely resembled income-tax forms, giving the impression 
that Schmidt was sanctioned by a government agency. There was no indication 
that the flyers were mailed by a private business. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt, now a resident of Ventura, said he had consulted with officials in 
the county clerk's office before mailing the flyers and assumed there was no 
problem. However, the clerk's office never officially approved the flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the clerk's office received complaints from business owners who had 
received the mailers, the district attorney filed suit against Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt said the message on the flyers may have confused some recipients, but 
he never intended to mislead anyone. He said he refunded money to those who had 
filed complaints against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt is the only candidate challenging the reelection of Ventura County 
Clerk Richard Dean in the June 7 election. He said he decided to run for county 
clerk because he believes the office can be managed more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dean said Schmidt had other motives for trying to unseat him. "I think 
it's simply a matter of retaliation and retribution." CARLOS V. LOZANO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MADD PLANNING CANDLELIGHT VIGIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving is planning 
several activities to commemorate Victim's Rights Week, including a candlelight 
vigil remembering those killed by drunk drivers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victim's Rights Week, April 24-30, will be highlighted by the candlelight 
vigil on Wednesday, said Linda Finnerty, executive director of MADD's Ventura 
County chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute vigil will start at 6:30 p.m. in the courtyard of the Government 
Center in Ventura, 800 S. Victoria Ave.  
</P>
<P>
 MADD members and the public are invited to join the vigil, which will 
commemorate Ventura County residents killed by drunk drivers. This year, the 
group will also honor slain Detective James O'Brien, killed in December by a 
gunman who opened fire at an Oxnard unemployment office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deal so much with law enforcement that we feel they hold a special place 
in our organization," Finnerty said.  
</P>
<P>
 At noon the same day, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury will officially unveil 
17 panels that will be on display at the Government Center. The panels show 
portraits of thousands of people nationwide who have been killed by drunk 
drivers, Finnerty said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be on display from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to show that these people are not just statistics," Finnerty said. 
"These are human beings that are being killed. For every picture on the board, 
there are countless others affected by their death." KAY SAILLANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: JUDGE DECLINES TO DISMISS INDICTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Latinos have not been systematically excluded from the Ventura County grand 
jury, a Santa Barbara County judge ruled Friday, declining to dismiss an 
indictment against a Thousand Oaks man accused of kidnaping and killing a 
Westlake nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys for slaying suspect Mark Scott Thornton had asked that court 
officials in Ventura County be forced to turn over extensive grand jury records 
on the ethnic and racial makeup of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 They questioned whether Latinos were unfairly excluded from the grand jury 
that indicted their client. If so, they said, the indictment should be thrown 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 But Superior Court Judge Bruce W. Dodds ruled that court officials were not 
obligated to turn over any more records relating to the grand jury than had 
been previously released. Officials gave attorneys some information on the 
makeup of the grand jury shortly after defense attorneys raised the issue in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it is a complete vindication for the jury commissioner and the 
court," said Robert Orellana, Ventura County counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Thornton, 19, kidnaped and fatally shot Kellie O'Sullivan, the 
mother of a young son. He has been charged with murder under special 
circumstances, which could lead to the death penalty if he is convicted. DWAYNE

SUPPORT FOUND FOR U.S. ROLE IN POPULATION CONTROL EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans generally view world population growth as a problem and support U.S. 
efforts to slow the increasing numbers of Earth's inhabitants, according to a 
poll released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roman Catholics and Protestants who attend church regularly are less 
likely to support specific policies such as legal abortion and family planning 
programs than other sectors of the electorate, the poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, released during a briefing at the United Nations, was commissioned 
by the Pew Global Stewardship Initiative. The briefing occurred in the final 
days of the Preparatory Committee meeting for September's International 
Conference on Population and Development, to be held in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings could provide moral and political support for the Clinton 
Administration's aggressive involvement in the population and development 
debate -- an involvement that has turned the U.S. policy of the last 12 years 
on its head, reversing the government's stance at the last international 
population conference in Mexico City 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That stance has set the United States at odds with the Vatican and a handful 
of mostly Central American nations such as Honduras and Nicaragua, where the 
governments have close ties to a conservative Catholic hierarchy that fiercely 
opposes much of the draft plan of action being prepared for the Cairo meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to U.S. attitudes on population appears to be freedom of choice, with 
vast majorities of Americans apparently agreeing that all men and women in the 
world who want birth control should be able to get it and that people should 
feel free to have as many children as they can properly raise. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Pew poll, in a random sample survey of 2,080 individuals who 
reported voting in the 1992 presidential election, nearly half -- 48% -- rated 
population growth as a "very serious" problem. That ranks the issue on a par 
with the spread of nuclear weapons and above threats to the world's environment 
but somewhat below disease and hunger in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the poll, 52% said they believed population growth will have a negative 
impact on their own quality of life while 55% said population growth may harm 
international economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether they agree with those who say nature will take care of balancing 
the Earth's population or with those who say there is a need for human 
intervention, 64% said they agree with the interventionists, while 29% agreed 
that nature will balance the scales. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority -- 55% -- said they favor U.S. sponsorship of programs overseas to 
help other countries slow population growth, with 19% "very much" in favor and 
36% "somewhat" in favor. Among the 42% opposed, 23% said they were somewhat 
opposed and 19% said they were very opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll results released April 20 also broke down the respondents by whether 
they were Protestant or Roman Catholic and whether they frequently attended 
worship services. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, Protestants and Roman Catholics are typical of the U.S. population, 
said Vince Breglio, a Republican pollster and one of three pollsters that 
conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 designating a "very serious" problem, 
Protestants gave rapid population growth a 7.0 rating, while Catholics gave it 
a 7.2 rating. Frequent churchgoers -- both Roman Catholic and Protestant -- 
rated rapid population growth somewhat lower, giving it a 6.9 rating. 
</P>
<P>
 The general population rated the population growth issue at 7.1. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholics and Protestants generally favored U.S. involvement in population 
programs, but that support diminished with the frequency of church attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if they favor U.S. sponsorship of voluntary family planning programs in 
developing countries, 57% of Protestants and 58% of Catholics said yes. But 52% 
of those describing themselves as frequent churchgoers said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 59% of those polled said they favor such programs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the volatile issue of abortion, the survey asked participants how well 
their feelings were described by the statement, "I believe all women should 
have the right to choose abortion." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Protestants, 51% answered "very well," 16% said "somewhat," while 7% 
said "not well" and 25% responded "not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Catholics, responses were 53% "very well," 17% "somewhat," 9% "not well" 
and 19% "not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent churchgoers answered 37% "very well," 17% "somewhat," 9% "not well" 
and 35% "not at all."

PLANNERS TO CONSIDER NEW SHAPELL PROJECT PROPOSAL; NEWBURY PARK: REVISED PLAN 
WOULD BUILD APARTMENT COMPLEX IN INDUSTRIAL AREA, NOT IN GATED COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 247-unit apartment complex that was originally proposed for a gated 
development in Newbury Park may be built in an industrial part of the city if 
the Planning Commission approves the new building plan Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shapell Industries development is planned for a 14-acre parcel near the 
corner of Lawrence Drive and Rancho Conejo Boulevard in Newbury Park north of 
the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal for the apartment complex was changed drastically last September 
when the City Council voted to move it from within the Rancho Conejo Village 
gated community. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the development said they objected to the prospect of paying 
homeowners' fees to support facilities that would be shared with renters. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the proposal to build the apartments in an industrial area 
came under fire from officials at Northrop Corp., which owns the land next to 
the proposed apartment site. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop officials said that moving apartments into the area could cost the 
city thousands of new jobs because no company would want to build next to an 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 But the City Council approved the move on a 3-2 vote, with Mayor Elois Zeanah 
and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski dissenting, both arguing that relocating the 
complex would be discriminatory against residents with lower incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again we're putting the lower-income residents in the least desirable 
locations," Zeanah said at the Sept. 30 meeting. "That's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the agreement to move the complex from within the gated community 
to an industrial area, the council members told Shapell they would need to 
include 40 to 60 moderate- to low-income units among the 246 apartments, said 
city planner Robert Rickards. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal Shapell will forward Monday includes 40 moderate-income units 
within the 22-building complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickards said the city staff recommends approving the project because of the 
benefits of locating such a complex in an industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as a new, but highly acceptable location for this kind of 
project," Rickards said. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, he said, traffic conditions would be improved by the project 
because people traveling to and from work would be driving in the reverse 
direction from most people in the industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, people who work for the neighboring companies can live closer to 
work, also reducing traffic in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 When it is complete, the complex will include several amenities, including a 
recreational complex with a weight room and swimming pool, two children's play 
areas and an underground parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also includes access to all ground level apartments for the disabled, 
Rickards said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, plans for the complex also include grading a portion of 
protected open space and grading around three oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapell representative Frank Faye declined to comment on the project. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Planning Commission will hold a public hearing on the 
project 7:30 p.m. Monday, at City Hall, 2400 Willow Lane.

DALAI LAMA FEARS EFFECTS OF CLASH OVER LEADERSHIP; BUDDHISM: ON U.S. VISIT, 
RELIGIOUS FIGURE SAYS CHINA MAY TRY TO EXPLOIT A PROLONGED DEBATE OVER WHICH OF 
TWO YOUNGSTERS IS A LIVING BUDDHA. 
</P>

<P>
 Amid rising international attention on human rights violations in China, the 
Dalai Lama, stopping in the Bay Area this week during a five-city American 
tour, entered the fray in the controversy over whether there is a living 
Buddha, and suggested that the Chinese government might try to use the debate 
to divide the Tibetan people. 
</P>
<P>
 The revered Tibetan leader, who makes his home in exile in Dharmasala, India, 
spent two days in Northern California, including a visit with Stanford 
University professors and a major address at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 During a meeting with reporters in Menlo Park, he talked about everything from 
his penchant for watching the TV show "MASH" before evening prayers to U.S. 
economic policy toward China, which has occupied Tibet since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dalai Lama has unsuccessfully tried to negotiate with the Chinese 
government about the future of Tibet, where the Buddhist community is 
undergoing a leadership crisis unparalleled since the Chinese takeover of their 
mountaintop kingdom in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the efforts of the Dalai Lama to settle the controversy during the 
last two years, the leadership struggle has led to armed attacks on Tibetan 
monasteries in India and rock- and bottle-throwing melees by Buddhist monks 
best known for their pacifism and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the controversy are two Tibetan boys, ages 9 and 11, each 
with a faction claiming that their boy as the true reincarnation of the 
17th-Century Gyalwa Karmapa, who has traditionally been one of the three most 
revered and powerful leaders of the Tibetan people. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the Dalai Lama, Tibetan devotees and many Western converts consider 
the Karmapa to be a living Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview this week, the Dalai Lama said he understands why many 
Westerners are puzzled by reports that Tibetan monks are battling each other 
over which Karmapa is the real Karmapa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, the Buddhist tradition is very nonviolent, but that does not mean 
that over the past 2,500 years there has never been violence," he said, leaning 
back in his armchair, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, spiritual leadership is passed on by 
the rebirth of gurus in the form of youngsters who show extraordinary abilities 
and mystic knowledge of their predecessors' prophecies or belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dalai Lama -- who was discovered by this method two years after his birth 
in the summer of 1935 -- said that it is possible for a very high Tibetan lama 
to experience several reincarnations at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for the Karmapa, there could be two or three, but as far as the person who 
will sit on the throne, there will only be one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dalai Lama quickly added, however, that "the danger is that the Chinese 
government might exploit the situation" and try to divide the Tibetan people by 
appealing to their religious passions. 
</P>
<P>
 The roots of the current controversy date back to Nov. 5, 1988, and the death 
of the 18th Karmapa in a Chicago hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, no successor was found to lead the Karma Kagyu 
Buddhist lineage, which is one of the four major Tibetan sects and runs about 
400 monasteries and meditation centers in Asia, Europe and the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1992, one of the four Karma Kagyu regents, a kind of Tibetan 
archbishop, said that he discovered a note left by the 18th Karmapa in a 
silk-covered protection amulet. 
</P>
<P>
 The note found by regent Tai Situ Rimpoche reportedly contained clues about 
where to find the 17th Karmapa. It read, in part: 
</P>
<P>
 "From here to the north in the east of the land of snow. Is a country where 
divine thunder spontaneously blazes. In a beautiful nomad's place with the sign 
of a cow. The method is Dondrup and the wisdom is Lolaga. Born in the year of 
the one used for the earth. With the miraculous, far-reaching sound of the 
white one: This is the one known as Karmapa." 
</P>
<P>
 Using these clues, Tai Situ found a boy named Ogyen Drudhul Trinley Dorje 
among the nomads of eastern Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was born in 1985, the Tibetan Year of the Wood Ox, to a father named 
Dhondup and a mother named Loga. Villagers reportedly told monks that three 
days after the boy's birth they heard miraculous music and the sound of a conch 
shell. 
</P>
<P>
 After the boy's 1992 installation in a mountain monastery in Tibet, however, 
another of the 16th Karmapa's four regents, Shamar Rimpoche, rejected the 
leader and called the mysterious note "a very obvious forgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Shamar Rimpoche, called the Sharmapa by his followers, installed 
his own choice as the 17th Karmapa, an 11-year-old named Tenzin Chentse. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ensuing power struggle, the two factions have accused each other of 
being used by the Beijing government to control one of Tibet's major religious 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Dalai Lama has backed Trinley Dorje as the 17th Karmapa, both 
factions continue to fight, saying that the dispute is a major embarrassment 
for Tibetan Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
 "A disgrace to the whole religion," Tai Situ Rimpoche said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dalai Lama said: "We are appealing to both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Stops on the Dalai Lama's U.S. visit include Ann Arbor, Mich., Berea and 
Louisville, Ky., and New York City. He returns to India Wednesday.

SCHOLAR TO OFFER VIEWS ON PHILISTINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have the Philistines gotten a bad rap? 
</P>
<P>
 Tammi Schneider, a Claremont scholar who has spent six seasons excavating the 
ancient Philistine city of Ekron under the direction of two world-renowned 
authorities, will offer her views at a May 4 lecture sponsored by the 
California Museum of Ancient Art. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philistines have been decried since biblical times. Repeatedly at war with 
the Israelites, the Philistines captured the Ark of the Covenant and took it to 
Ekron, according to biblical accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a Philistine giant called Goliath that David felled with a slingshot at 
the gates of Ekron. And the god of Ekron -- Beelzebub -- is practically a 
household word among even the most cursory students of the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 So discredited have the Philistines become that today's English dictionary 
defines a Philistine as a narrow-minded individual who is conventional in his 
or her tastes and views -- and indifferent to cultural and aesthetic values. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, the expert on the Philistines, is assistant professor of Old 
Testament Studies at the Claremont Graduate School and an Assyriologist. She 
received a doctorate in ancient history from the University of Pennsylvania in 
1991. Her field was archeology, history and languages of the Bible and 
Mesopotamia. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider's talk is part of a two-lecture series, "Great Peoples of the 
Ancient Near East," sponsored by the museum. On June 8, Amand Podangy will 
speak on "Daily Life in the Old Babylonian Empire." 
</P>
<P>
 Both lectures will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Gallery Theater in Barnsdall 
Park, 4800 Hollywood Blvd., half a block west of Vermont Avenue. For more 
information, call (818) 762-5500.

PROPOSAL LINKS HOME LOANS TO FAMILY SIZE; THOUSAND OAKS: SOME OFFICIALS PROTEST 
THAT NEW CITY REQUIREMENTS WOULD DISCRIMINATE AGAINST LARGE, LOW-INCOME 
HOUSEHOLDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to help low-income residents purchase homes in Thousand Oaks calls 
for targeting buyers who demonstrate "control of household size" -- a provision 
some officials are blasting as discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the newly revised Ownership Assistance Program, the city would offer 
first dibs on low-interest loans to buyers who met the family size guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-person household, for example, would have to purchase a home with at 
least three bedrooms to be eligible for priority consideration when the city 
doles out loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will consider adopting the new guidelines on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the concept of linking loans to family size is drawing opposition 
from real estate agents, public housing experts and some politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting so far into the private lives of people that it's almost scary," 
Councilman Frank Schillo said Friday. "I don't think it's right or proper." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the guidelines as unworkable as well as unethical, Schillo added: 
"It's almost impossible to enforce. What if a family has another kid after they 
buy the home? What are they going to do, throw him out?" 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, the household size guidelines would be applied with some 
flexibility, so parents with three small children could squeeze into a 
two-bedroom unit, said Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski, a member of the housing 
issues committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Zukowski and Mayor Elois Zeanah noted that the city's proposed guidelines 
resemble federal standards to prevent overcrowding in public housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development generally aims for two 
people per bedroom, plus one extra person -- so a total of five people might 
live in a two-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
 But some local experts worried that the city's loan-eligibility requirements 
might push home ownership out of reach for large, low-income families. A 
household comprising a retired grandparent, a young couple and two children, 
for example, would be encouraged to buy a three-bedroom home, even though the 
group might be living on just two minimum-wage salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would oppose anything that would preclude families of a specific size from 
being able to use this service," said Gene Baird, president of the Conejo 
Valley Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the low-interest loans would come from city redevelopment funds, not 
federal money, the council has the legal right to impose eligibility 
requirements, according to Debra Rodriguez, executive director of the Ventura 
County Fair Housing Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But family size guidelines, she said, seem openly discriminatory. And she 
predicted that the Fair Housing Council would be willing to investigate if 
someone challenges the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of minorities tend to have a lot of children, especially in the Latino 
community," Rodriguez said. "This would exclude a lot of them." 
</P>
<P>
 That scenario would run counter to the council's stated goal of using the 
Ownership Assistance Program to help renters in Las Casitas, a neighborhood 
where 43% of the residents are Latinos. Although all of the units have been 
sold as condominiums, more than half are being rented out by absentee owners. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the program on Tuesday, Las Casitas renters will get 
first shot at an estimated $500,000 in city funds. The money would be disbursed 
in the form of 20-year loans to low-income residents buying their first homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, city officials hope to double the number of homeowners in Las 
Casitas. Arguing that owners take better care of their property than renters, 
officials predict a quieter, cleaner and safer neighborhood if the ownership 
program succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure a smooth transition, some Las Casitas homeowners support the city's 
proposal to tie low-interest loans to household size. All 540 condominiums 
within the neighborhood are two-bedroom units, so only households with four or 
fewer people would be eligible for priority loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, it would be almost a blessing," said Robert Bickle, president of the 
local homeowner association. 
</P>
<P>
 Because four units share a single laundry machine and because the homeowner 
association pays for hot water, overcrowded units strain the neighborhood's 
resources, Bickle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not too sure if four is the right number -- that might be a little 
tight," he added. "But the concept isn't so far-fetched. Overcrowding 
accelerates the deterioration of the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Schillo argued that more flexible guidelines would end up boosting the 
neighborhood by encouraging more renters to apply for loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to get more homeowners," he said. "Whether you have four or five 
people living in a unit is immaterial -- the point is, they'll have pride of 
ownership."

 Grass-roots religious organizations working for social change are among those 
eligible to apply for "Community Bridges" grants from the California Community 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based foundation established the $1-million, four-year grant 
program last year to improve relations between the many ethnic and racial 
groups in Los Angeles County. Programs operated by religion-based groups that 
help Angelenos of different cultural traditions work together received four of 
16 initial grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Jones, the foundation's vice president for program, said: "These grants 
are at such a local level that their impact will be hard to measure. It's like 
throwing tiny little pebbles into a very large pond. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) we hope that they can create a climate in which deserving organizations 
can get further recognition and funding," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants are given annually in three areas: dialogue, conflict resolution 
and mediation between and among ethnic and racial groups; community organizing 
and planning to solve problems in ethnically and racially mixed neighborhoods; 
and youth leadership development programs that provide constructive 
opportunities for disadvantaged low-income youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of last year's grants to religious organizations were in the area of 
conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-sectarian National Council of Jewish Women and the African Community 
Refugee Center received $5,600 for a joint program, which provides support 
groups for immigrant women of six ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council received $25,000 to operate 
youth-led intergroup-relations conferences for middle school parents, students 
and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Two Cultures, One Heart" program of Kehillath Israel synagogue in Pacific 
Palisades and Abundance of Christ Church in South-Central Los Angeles received 
$20,000 to launch the Rainbow Inn, a fish restaurant that employs church 
neighborhood youths as workers and managers, supervised by adults from the 
church and the synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth grant to a religious organization was for neighborhood organizing. 
Centro Pastoral Rutilio Grande in Hollywood, founded by the late Father Luis 
Olivares, received $7,000 for management training. A human services 
organization housed at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament, the center is 
dedicated to improving relations between recent Central American immigrants, 
business owners and longtime Mexican American residents in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said that the Community Bridges program -- which receives funds from the 
Ford, William Randolph Hearst and Pacific Mutual foundations and other large 
private charities -- targets poverty-stricken and ethnically mixed areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Grants may be sought for new efforts or for expanding or improving programs. 
The grants generally do not exceed $25,000 a year for a single project.

A LIFE OF SUMMITS AND DARK VALLEYS; RELENTLESS RESURGENCE WAS THE 37TH 
PRESIDENT'S HALLMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end of his compelling and dispassionate three-volume biography of 
Richard Nixon, the historian Stephen E. Ambrose sums up his subject's nature, 
those traits that over a long career brought the 37th President stunning 
political triumphs but ultimately disgrace and ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, he writes, was the toughest American politician of his time. 
Disciplined, highly knowledgeable, a hard worker, an inveterate risk taker. A 
man of enormous pride who was never ready to accept defeat. A stuffed shirt who 
even walking along a beach or relaxing in his own home could be found dressed 
in suit and tie. Painfully shy, inherently suspicious, incapable of trusting 
others, a consummate actor, much given to self-pity. And beneath the surface 
there was always a simmering anger whose sources can only be guessed at -- he 
was, writes Ambrose, "the angriest American President." 
</P>
<P>
 A CORE OF CONFLICT: To Nixon, power was a matter of manipulation, of favors, 
public relations, polls, smears, intimidation, and not, as some other 
Presidents intuitively understood, an ability to lead by persuasion and a 
talent to inspire confidence, always in a context that respected the limits 
that govern the democratic exercise of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 To Nixon, conflict was what gave life its sense and substance. In an interview 
with David Frost he said ". . . What makes life mean something is purpose. A 
goal. The battle. The struggle. Even if you don't win it." In the political 
world his greatest admiration was reserved for those -- Winston Churchill, 
Charles de Gaulle, Mao Tse-tung -- who had struggled and suffered defeat before 
they experienced victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon won more than his share of electoral and legislative battles, not all of 
them by fair means. He was elected to the House from Whittier as a young Navy 
veteran in 1946, to the Senate four years later in a mean and bitter campaign. 
Less than two years afterward he won the second spot on the Republican national 
ticket. He served eight years as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president, failed 
to win the presidency in 1960 by a hairbreadth -- a shift of a few thousand 
votes would have given him an electoral college victory over John F. Kennedy -- 
then lost decisively when he ran for governor of California in 1962. At that 
point he seemed headed for history's ash heap. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead he began one of the most remarkable comebacks in American political 
history. Narrowly elected President in 1968 and smashingly reelected in 1972, 
Nixon embarked on a series of bold and controversial initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign policy he was proudest of ending U.S. involvement in the Vietnam 
War, achieving an opening with China and reaching detente with the Soviet 
Union. In domestic policy he outraged many conservatives in his own party by 
proposing welfare reform, national health insurance for all, a negative income 
tax for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 RUIN AND RETURN: The Watergate scandal -- the burglary of Democratic Party 
headquarters followed by an expanding conspiracy to cover up White House 
involvement in that and other crimes -- destroyed the second Nixon 
Administration. Facing articles of impeachment drawn up by the House Judiciary 
Committee, accused of misusing presidential power and obstructing justice, 
confronted with self-produced tapes detailing the cover-up, Nixon resigned on 
Aug. 9, 1974. A month later he received a presidential pardon for any crimes he 
might have committed. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, typically, he began his slow climb back from disgrace, traveling 
widely, writing prolifically, at least partially reclaiming his cherished role 
of international statesman, if not the respect his fellow citizens had once 
accorded him. Perhaps he still had hopes of that, too, when he died Friday at 
age 81.

AIR POWER ISN'T ENOUGH; THE BOSNIAN ARMY NEEDS ARMS, AND EUROPE NEEDS RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NATO announced Friday in Brussels that it will begin air strikes today against 
Bosnian Serb heavy weapons and other military targets within a 12-mile radius 
of the center of the besieged town of Gorazde unless the siege is immediately 
lifted. Comparable exclusion zones were announced for the four remaining "safe 
haven" towns.In Belgrade U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi said that the Serbs 
had agreed to the Gorazde cease-fire and the weapons withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bosnian Serbs keep this agreement, then the threat of NATO air 
engagement will have done for Gorazde what it did in February for Sarajevo. If 
the Serbs do not keep the agreement, then the war may suddenly and rapidly 
escalate. Two hundred NATO planes are positioned to reply. Ominously, the 
families of British and American diplomatic personnel have been ordered to 
leave Belgrade immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration maintains that the purpose of the new ultimatum is 
to bring the Bosnian Serbs back to the negotiating table. But the Serbs have 
never left the table. They have merely made a joke of it, and they will 
continue to do so until the balance of power changes. 
</P>
<P>
 For this to happen, NATO air power, strategically deployed, must be matched by 
the ground power of the Bosnian National Army. The Clinton Administration must 
continue to press for a lifting of the punitive, arguably illegal Bosnian arms 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as it does so, the Administration must recognize that Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin's summit proposal is not marginal but potentially 
central to a final settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 A summit conference has a certain meaning. It says -- and rightly -- that 
Bosnia is not a sideshow but a full-blown European crisis that will not be 
solved without a new, post-Cold War political consensus with arms to back it.

A BIG FAT 'F' IN CIVICS; DEMOCRACY A STRANGER IN SCHOOL VOTING ON YEAR-ROUND 
SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many school systems have site-based management programs in place. The early 
line on transfers of power from central bureaucracies to local schools is that 
they can greatly improve matters or at least bring a sense of involvement in 
painful decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The former is apparent at two San Fernando Valley schools that will end the 
year with huge budget surpluses, which can be directed to new programs. The 
latter was the case in Orange County's Cypress School District, where 
principals used site councils of parents, teachers and administrators to help 
make decisions about budget problems that resulted in a few layoffs last year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, local control can be abused. A case in point is the Euclid Avenue 
Elementary School, in the Boyle Heights section of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining enrollment at the school meant that it could join the many Los 
Angeles Unified School District campuses that have switched from year-round 
schedules to a traditional calendar year. In balloting at the various campuses 
last year, majorities ruled in one-person, one-vote elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But the staff at Euclid stacked the deck. There, teacher and staff votes each 
counted for 6.32 points. Each parent's counted for one point. Thus, the 386 
parents who voted for the traditional school year lost to 65 staffers who 
preferred the year-round schedule. So it was one-person, one-vote if you were a 
parent; if you were a school staffer, it was one person, six votes. This is the 
American way?  
</P>
<P>
 "What lesson does this send to our children?" a letter by the parents demanded 
to know. What lesson, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools are supposed to teach democratic principles, not undermine them. Even 
South Africa has embraced the concept of one person, one vote. That's a lesson 
in recent world history that ought to be required at Euclid Avenue Elementary.

SCIENCE WATCH; ARE YOU THERE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The odds are that somewhere in a universe containing stars beyond counting -- 
think here in terms of hundreds of billions -- there are planets besides our 
own and our solar system's other eight.Also, the odds are that, given the 
advance of science and human ingenuity, someone would start to find them. For 
the first time, astronomers think they have done so. 
</P>
<P>
 A team led by Alexander Wolszczan of Pennsylvania State University says it has 
"irrefutable evidence" that at least two planets and maybe a third are orbiting 
a star in the constellation Virgo, 1,200 light-years (7,000 trillion miles) 
away. The objects are too distant and too small to be seen by optical 
telescopes. Their existence is inferred from the radio signals emanating from 
the pulsar, the rapidly spinning residue of a dead star, around which they 
orbit. Could there be life on these objects? Almost certainly not, given the 
inhospitable neighborhood. But now that the Wolszczan team says it has proven 
our solar system isn't unique there's even more reason to assume that on 
planets elsewhere, yet to be detected, life does exist. That life could 
conceivably make our own state of evolution seem primitive. 
</P>
<P>
 It's something to ponder, the possibility that some place in this vast and 
still expanding universe -- maybe even in many places -- civilizations exist 
that can boast their own or even better Shakespeares, Mozarts, Einsteins, 
Roseanne Arnolds. It would be nice to get in touch sometime.

CORPORATE AID FOR POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Claims by the Southern California Coalition for Responsive Philanthropy that 
the BankAmerica Foundation contributes too little to the poor are arbitrary and 
misleading ("Charities Failing the Poor, Group Says" April 14). The coalition 
complains that "only" 28% of the BankAmerica Foundation's nationwide giving in 
1992 went to poverty-related programs. However, as Times reporter Susan Moffat 
points out, this figure does not include $3.5 million in corporate gifts to the 
United Way. Indeed, we contribute more money to the United Way than any other 
corporation in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Our philanthropy program represents a balanced effort to meet the needs of 
communities throughout California and nine other Western states. Last year, the 
BankAmerica Corp. and its charitable foundation contributed $26 million to 
support priorities such as community economic development, affordable housing 
and education. Roughly $5 million went to Los Angeles, and a significant share 
was earmarked for low-income recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, philanthropy is only one measure of corporate responsibility. 
Another is the way a company conducts its day-to-day business. And Bank of 
America vigorously seeks to empower low-income individuals through economic 
opportunity initiates. Examples include the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Helping to rebuild L.A. The bank's $25-million Small Business Investment 
Program is enabling more than 500 entrepreneurs to recover from the damage they 
suffered during civil disturbances two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Providing capital to minority-owned employers. We recently joined forces 
with the Commerce Department to make loans and technical assistance more easily 
available to minority-owned businesses throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financing affordable housing. Bank of America's Community Development Bank 
is now the No. 1 source of affordable housing construction in all of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encouraging homeownership. We are the largest commercial bank provider of 
home loans in low-income areas of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The needs of the poor are tremendous. Their plight is society's problem, and 
it must be addressed through the cooperative efforts of government, business 
and community-based organizations. So it is both ironic and unfortunate that a 
group seeking to alleviate poverty should take aim at Los Angeles County's most 
committed organizations while sparing those companies which contribute little 
or nothing at all.

 * Regarding your article (April 14) on poverty programs and local foundations, 
on behalf of our board of trustees it should be noted that with respect to the 
Dan Murphy Foundation, the group conducting the study arbitrarily excluded 
grants "in the religious category" when in fact these grants were to Roman 
Catholic religious institutions and communities of religious men and women who 
have dedicated their lives to serving the poor through education, caring for 
the sick, the elderly, the homeless and the abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 If these grants are included, the result is that over 80% of the foundation's 
giving goes to people and programs assisting the poor.

SINGAPORE DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial "Onerous Price for Tidiness" (April 5) attacked Singapore as "a 
repressive place whose disgraceful standards of political participation, press 
freedom and criminal justice are unattractive by any modern gauge." 
</P>
<P>
 If Singapore really is a repressive place, why do 6 million tourists visit 
every year? They move about freely without fear of being raped, mugged or 
murdered. It this possible in major U.S. cities? 
</P>
<P>
 You alleged that Singapore "has the trappings of parliamentary democracy, but 
little of the reality," and that "the People's Action Party has exercised 
one-party control since independence in 1965." We have held seven general 
elections since 1965. The process is free and open. Many political parties 
contest. The electorate consistently voted for the People's Action Party, and 
gave it the mandate to apply those very laws that have made Singapore "devoid 
of crime, litter, gangs, graffiti and poverty." Is this wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Chee Soon Juan did not lose his job because he challenged the prime 
minister in the 1992 by-election, or involved himself in politics. He misused 
university research funds to post copies of his wife's Ph.D. thesis to the 
U.S., for the purpose of her Ph.D. examination, and then lied about what he had 
done. The university dismissed him for dishonest conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign media are welcome in Singapore; 185 foreign correspondents are 
based here; 4,500 foreign publications circulate here. The handful whose 
circulations were restricted had engaged in Singapore's domestic politics. They 
have since accepted that they circulate in Singapore subject to conditions 
imposed by the government. In particular, they must not interfere in domestic 
politics, and must give the government the right to reply to inaccurate 
reporting in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Our laws protect the majority of law-abiding citizens. Criminals cannot escape 
justice on the excuse of "victimhood." You may think that the price of keeping 
Singapore clean, safe, and crime-free is too high. Most Singaporeans and the 6 
million tourists, Americans included, disagree.

CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS ON TOBACCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'd rather have a sister in a whorehouse than a brother in the tobacco 
industry! 
</P>
<P>
 What arrogant, preposterous testimony those tobacco executives gave at the 
congressional hearing (April 15). Of course tobacco is addictive! More to some 
than others, of course, and without intoxicating behavior. But addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 If tobacco were invented today it would be outlawed immediately. Nevertheless, 
in deference to those already hooked, tobacco should not now be outlawed. But 
advertising tobacco should not be allowed. Not in print media, not on 
billboards, not on race cars, not in ballparks, not on belt buckles or hats or 
shirts, nowhere except the pack itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Because "providing tobacco to minors" laws are not enforced, tobacco vendors 
should be licensed, just as liquor vendors are, with the minimum age for 
purchase 21 years.  
</P>
<P>
 The industry needs to be heavily controlled.

 Let's take prohibition to its absurdity by outlawing alcohol, caffeine,

</P>
<P>
 I really do feel sympathy for the tobacco farmers who are the innocent 
economic losers in the medical discoveries about the harm caused by their 
product. The same article could be written, however, about the innocent coca 
farmers of Bolivia, innocently cultivating the chief cash crop of their 
economic region.  
</P>
<P>
 The fact remains, in both cases, no matter how innocent and accidental their 
original involvement may have been, that they are merchants of death, producing 
products that kill or injure when used as directed. Our efforts must be focused 
toward helping them make the transition into other economic alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution, of course, is the development of alternative crops. They have 
made beginning efforts, but they have not gone far enough. All government 
subsidies for tobacco farmers must immediately be redirected toward assistance 
in converting to other options, including retraining for entirely new 
industries, if necessary.

D.A.'S MACHINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am appalled by the unfounded accusations being leveled at Judge Lawrence 
Storch by the district attorney. It seems odd to me that Mr. Bradbury would 
wait until his office was aware of Judge Storch's intent to leave the criminal 
department before he had the nerve to publicly challenge his decisions.The 
timing of this challenge is obviously related to Mr. Bradbury's support of the 
candidacy of Colleen (Toy) White for a judicial office. Mr. Bradbury will, no 
doubt, use these manufactured charges of leniency to seek support for his "law 
and order" candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Storch is one of the finest jurists on our bench. He has had a long and 
distinguished career and does not deserve to be treated in this fashion. I have 
known Judge Storch personally and professionally for many years and know him to 
be a dedicated and qualified judge. 
</P>
<P>
 I find it very interesting that the district attorney offered the defendant a 
"plea bargain" to manslaughter in the same case they are now claiming as the 
basis for their decision to challenge Judge Storch on future cases. The last 
time I checked, manslaughter was a less severe crime than murder. If they felt 
that first-degree murder was the only appropriate charge, why the "plea 
bargain"? 
</P>
<P>
 As an attorney and civil litigator, I and my colleagues welcome the 
opportunity to have Judge Storch on the civil bench once again. I am only sorry 
that Mr. Bradbury has taken this cheap shot at the conclusion of the wonderful 
career of Judge Storch.

'JUDGE SHOPPING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury has gone too far. His order that his deputies 
must disqualify Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch in all criminal cases is 
not based upon legitimate reason.It is a selfish and childish reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Storch is a highly intelligent person. He has a fine legal education. 
His years of service have demonstrated diligence, ability and an evenhanded 
fairness that are admired by his colleagues and a large majority of the 
attorneys and litigants who have appeared in his court. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Bradbury is also intelligent, well-educated and competent. He 
suffers, however, from one glaring weakness. He cannot stand to lose. He flies 
into an emotional pique and seeks to disqualify a highly qualified judge for 
the sole reason that the judge, in all good conscience, does not agree with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time. During the past several years a series of judges 
and commissioners have made his blacklist. He was not satisfied to seek 
amelioration by turning to the appellate court. Instead, he took the Draconian 
step of automatic blackballing, regardless of the type of case, and regardless 
of the resulting interference with orderly administration of the judicial 
system. Such "judge shopping" is inconsistent with the high standards which the 
people of Ventura County have a right to expect from their district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago, Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Bradbury was young, 
competent, eager and a gentleman. It is regrettable that the power he achieved 
has changed him so much. Ventura County is no longer well-served.

STORCH BLACKBALLED

<TEXT>
<P>
 I have had the honored privilege of knowing Judge Lawrence Storch for many 
years and have participated in thoughtful discussions with him. He is a person 
of quality, honor and admiration. 
</P>
<P>
 I have also known Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury from the time he was a young 
person out of law school and I was a young police officer. As a young person I 
found Bradbury to be a petty, envious, sniveling person who threw temper 
tantrums when he didn't get his way. Nothing has changed. His removal of Judge 
Storch from hearing criminal cases is just another example of Bradbury's lack 
of wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, Bradbury's life wouldn't make a pimple on any one of Judge 
Storch's decisions.

THERE IS NO MOORER DOUBT; BOXING: UNDEFEATED CHALLENGER DEFEATS HOLYFIELD TO 
WIN HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the tense, uncertain silence of the moment, the crowd was hushed and 
anxious, but Michael Moorer was smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew, even if nobody else did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it," Moorer said in a near whisper as he stared out into the Caesars 
Palace crowd after 12 rounds of back-and-forth action. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, it was official, and the world had its first left-handed heavyweight 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 On a majority decision, after bouncing back from the canvas in the second 
round, Moorer defeated Evander Holyfield to win the World Boxing Assn. and 
International Boxing Federation heavyweight titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people doubted me," Moorer said at the post-fight news conference in 
which he credited trainer Teddy Atlas for pushing him in training camp and 
throughout the fight. "They said I'd never been in a fight this big -- which I 
hadn't. But I knew I could do it. I beat the man." 
</P>
<P>
 After crashing to his knees late in the second round, a victim of Holyfield's 
sharp left hook, Moorer assumed control of the fight in the third, fourth and 
fifth rounds, landing uppercuts that had Holyfield stumbling and opening a deep 
cut over the champion's left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he was thinking when he was on his knees during the knockdown, 
Moorer said: "What anybody else who's human would think: What am I doing down 
here? 
</P>
<P>
 "But I came back." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Holyfield apparently suffered an injured left shoulder early in 
the fight -- a rotator cuff problem for which he was taken to Valley Hospital 
afterward -- Moorer appeared to stall in the seventh round, giving Holyfield a 
path back into the fight by slowing his pace and absorbing heavy punishment 
from Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the fight on the line, Moorer (35-0) surged back in the 12th round, 
fighting through Holyfield's final flurry and hitting Holyfield (30-2) 
repeatedly. Moorer won the 12th on all cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Jerry Roth scored it 115-114 and judge Chuck Giampa scored it 116-112 
for Moorer. Judge Dalby Shirley scored it 114-114. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't going to give up, that's all," said Moorer's grandfather, Henry 
Smith, who taught Moorer to box. "I was never nervous for him, not even during 
the knockdown, because he's been down before and he's always gotten back up." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, 26, suggested that the 31-year-old Holyfield was looking past him as 
he plotted his plans to unify the heavyweight title against World Boxing 
Council champion Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "His plan was to fight Lennox Lewis," Moorer said. "Never underestimate the 
other man." 
</P>
<P>
 After the decision, Holyfield said he was unsure whether he would continue to 
fight and said he thought he could have won the decision. But he credited 
Moorer for delivering all the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer said he simply wanted to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Moorer fought a great fight," said Holyfield's trainer, Don Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, who has been tentative at the start of fights before, came out in high 
gear, flicking his hard right jab into Holyfield's face through much of the 
early rounds. The jab would eventually be the decisive punch of the fight, 
catching Holyfield high on his head and keeping the champion continuously 
off-balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I have a pretty effective jab," Moorer said. "I can disrupt a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Both fighters were hurt in the second, but Moorer is the one who hit the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second, Moorer walked through a Holyfield jab and caught the 
champion clean on the jaw with a left uppercut, staggering Holyfield against 
the ropes. Moorer dominated most of the middle of the round with flashing 
lefts, but the tide turned quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Moorer's pressure, Holyfield landed a clean right hook-left hook 
combination that immediately dropped Moorer, who entered the fight with a 
suspect chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Things settled down some in the third, but Holyfield showed no signs of 
backing away from Moorer's power and Moorer continued to press the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't choke," said Moorer's manager, John Davimos, as the fight 
progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer increased the pace in the fourth, and Holyfield stood his ground and 
absorbed several heavy uppercuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth was one of the toughest rounds Holyfield has ever endured -- 
comparable to the 10th round against Riddick Bowe in their first fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer landed a devastating left uppercut halfway through the round that 
clearly hurt Holyfield, who wobbled around the ring as Moorer prowled after 
him. Holyfield tried to recover, but by the end of the round had blood pouring 
over his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 It was more of the same in the sixth, although Holyfield's backpedaling 
eliminated many of Moorer's hardest shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But the seventh was classic Holyfield renewal, emerging from his two-round 
lethargy with several inside shots. Moorer was never injured but was put on the 
defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 With his corner screaming for him to throw more punches in the eighth and 
ninth, Moorer for the first time seemed to realize that he was in the biggest 
fight of his life and looked slightly hesitant and wary of the champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield's cut was still opening at the end of rounds, but Moorer allowed 
Holyfield to dictate the pace until the 10th, when he slowly began to reassert 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know (Holyfield was hurt)," Moorer said. "He was punching like a 
mule." 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier fight, John John Molina retained his IBF junior-lightweight 
title in a methodical unanimous-decision victory over Gregorio Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina (35-3) peppered Vargas (29-5-1) with sharp shots from beginning to end 
and won easily on all three cards. 
</P>
<P>
 In a major upset, John Michael Johnson (18-4, 14 KOs) avenged a previous 
defeat by stopping previously undefeated Junior Jones (32-1) at 1:21 of the 
11th round to win the WBA bantamweight championship.

JIM MURRAY: THERE'S NO MOORER DOUBT; THERE WAS TOO MUCH LEFT TO DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you can't remember the name of the new heavyweight champion of the world, 
don't worry. Try "Lefty." 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of this fight for the title Friday night was decided at birth. 
When Michael Moorer grabbed the rattle in his left fist, he had as much of an 
edge he would need to separate Evander Holyfield from his heavyweight 
championship at Caesar's Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, you never mention "rope" in the house of the hanged, and it might 
not be a good idea to mention the word "left" in the domicile of the Holyfields 
of Atlanta.  
</P>
<P>
 You know, too, old-time fight managers knew better than to let their charges 
fight left-handers.  
</P>
<P>
 Poor Holyfield didn't know what he had done to himself. He might as well have 
been trying to fight an octopus. He had no clue.  
</P>
<P>
 Left-handed batters fear left-handers. Heavyweight champions should, too.  
</P>
<P>
 We all know how Holyfield makes his fight -- like an oncoming train. He's on 
rails.  
</P>
<P>
 He kept sliding off the tracks Friday. It wasn't that Michael Moorer wasn't 
there. It was simply that he wasn't where he was supposed to be.  
</P>
<P>
 One result was, we saw Holyfield doing something he never does -- run. Even 
then, he didn't know which way to go. He looked like a guy standing in the rain 
wondering where everybody went. You had the feeling he wanted to stop and 
scream at Moorer, "Why don't you stand up and fight like a man! Right-handed!" 
</P>
<P>
 Evander also did something he rarely does -- bleed. His left eye looked like 
the Red Sea by the late rounds.  
</P>
<P>
 It isn't as if we have a new Muhammad Ali or Joe Louis for champion. Moorer is 
not your basic Manassa Mauler or Aberdeen Assassin. Right-handed, he's probably 
merely another main-eventer at the Olympic.  
</P>
<P>
 He won the fight by a total of five points out of 685 cast. It wasn't his 
punches Holyfield couldn't stand, it was his silhouette. Evander looked as if 
he wanted to turn him around all night so he could get comfortable. He looked 
like a guy bumping into a clothesline.  
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield went to the hospital with what appears to be a rotator cuff injury 
after the fight. That came from throwing punches all night where they ain't -- 
or at least where Moorer wasn't.  
</P>
<P>
 Half the world is probably left-handed. But most have been at pains to conceal 
it. Particularly in the prize ring.  
</P>
<P>
 Moorer is a fine specimen. He's 6 feet 2 and most of it is in prime condition. 
There is only about two inches directly under his lip that is not in the 
greatest of condition. In fact, you can see through it.  
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield found this spot in the second round. Moorer went down. The crowd 
thought it was the beginning of the end. But it was almost the last time 
Holyfield figured a way to hit this turned-around fighter.  
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield makes his fight a little bit like a mole anyway. He sort of smothers 
you. Nothing worked for him against Lefty. In a sense, he went out with his bat 
on his shoulder.  
</P>
<P>
 Moorer's insolubility seemed to work best in the early rounds. By round 10, it 
was clear that Holyfield had to take control of the fight or become merely 
another ex-champ. He stepped up the pace as best he could fighting this left 
winger.  
</P>
<P>
 He was a picture of frustration. He still might have pulled it out if he had a 
smashing last round.  
</P>
<P>
 He didn't. He was like a guy handcuffed by then. It was almost as if he had 
his back to Moorer. Michael cuffed him around the ring. Every judge gave Moorer 
the last round -- and the championship.  
</P>
<P>
 "I beat the man!" gloated Moorer after the match.  
</P>
<P>
 So, he did. But he better be glad Mama or the teachers never said, "What are 
you picking up that fork with your off hand for, son? Eat right!" 
</P>
<P>
 He's a champion today for the same reason Babe Ruth was. He could hit 
right-handers. Or, maybe for the same reason Koufax was -- left-handers 
couldn't hit him.  
</P>
<P>
 Evander Holyfield spent the night like a guy in a haunted house. Old-timers 
could have predicted it. Never fight a southpaw. Only fight a north paw.  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I interrupted his plans," the southpaw chortled Friday night. "He was 
going to fight Lennox Lewis, wasn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
 In boxing, the left wing is the lunatic fringe. Moorer is the first lefty to 
win the title in the history of the fight game. Having the title is the only 
way for a southpaw to get a fight. Lewis had better not fight anybody for his 
share of the title until he sees him write.

DODGERS GO DOWN SWINGING IN NINTH; BASEBALL: RODRIGUEZ'S DIVING CATCH PROVIDES 
LIFT, BUT IT DOESN'T TRANSLATE IN 7-6 LOSS TO EXPOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The cheers from the crowd of 36,434 at Dodger Stadium Friday night were 
loudest in the ninth inning, when Henry Rodriguez, playing left field, seemed 
to run a mile to make a diving catch in short center field of a line drive by 
Cliff Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers trailed, 7-6, to the Montreal Expos, a score that would stand, 
with reliever Gary Wayne facing the heart of the order. And after Wayne retired 
the next two batters in order, the crowd stood again to salute Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game where the starters didn't last past the fourth inning and all the 
scoring took place before the fifth inning, Rodriguez's catch was the first 
highlight in innings. But the Dodgers also had the heart of the order coming up 
in the bottom of the ninth, and at least they made it interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 After reliever Mel Rojas struck out Brett Butler and Mike Piazza, he hit Tim 
Wallach on the forearm. Mitch Webster ran for Wallach and stole second with 
Eric Karros at bat. Then Rojas walked Karros. But that would be it for the 
Dodgers, because Jeff Treadway, batting for Raul Mondesi, struck out, giving 
Montreal its fourth consecutive victory and Rojas his third save. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good bunch of guys; they don't quit," Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
"Our bullpen did a good job, but so did theirs. They contained us. We had our 
chance in the fourth inning with the bases loaded with one out, but we didn't 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 For a knuckleball pitcher, the early innings are crucial, and Tom Candiotti 
(3-1) seemed to be off to a good start when he retired the first three batters 
for an easy first inning. But during the next two innings, the Expos got six 
hits, including a home run by Larry Walker, to go up, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 For these two teams, though, close games have become the norm. Eight of the 12 
games they played last season were decided by two runs or fewer. And at Dodger 
Stadium, the Expos have been horrible, with less success here in 25 seasons 
than at any other ballpark. They haven't had a winning season in Los Angeles 
since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Expos entered the three-game series having won three consecutive games 
for the first time this season. They have missed the intensity and speed of 
Delino DeShields, and Manager Felipe Alou recently arrived at a lineup that he 
believes might help put speed back on the bases, batting Floyd second behind 
Mike Lansing and ahead of Marquis Grissom and Walker. The trio led off the 
third with consecutive hits and scored to put the Expos ahead, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, though, also entered the series with a three-game winning streak. 
In six of their seven victories, they have come from behind to win. So on their 
bench, being down four runs is not insurmountable.  
</P>
<P>
 Against Expo starter Kirk Rueter, the Dodgers rallied for four runs in the 
bottom of the third and tied the score, 5-5. Butler led off the inning with a 
walk and Piazza, who was three for five, followed with a line drive to 
left-center field. After Wallach flied out, Karros drove a shot to right, 
scoring Butler, and Mondesi's sacrifice fly scored Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 Rueter had Cory Snyder down 0-2, when Snyder hit the next pitch into the seats 
in left field for his fourth home run, to score Karros and tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 But Candiotti continued to struggle and gave up two runs in the fourth on a 
walk and a triple by Mike Gardner, who pinch-hit for Rueter before Roger 
McDowell took over to finish the inning.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers scored in the bottom of the fourth to move within one when 
pinch-hitter Chris Gwynn walked and later scored on a grounder to right by 
Piazza. But with the bases loaded, both Karros and Mondesi popped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Against a group of three relievers, including winner Jeff Shaw (1-1), the 
Dodgers managed only one more hit after the fourth inning. The Expos retired 14 
batters in a row until the ninth, when Rojas hit Wallach.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers countered with four relievers, including Darren Dreifort, who 
combined to hold the Expos scoreless through five innings.

FINLEY LEAVES DOOR OPEN, RED SOX STEAL GAME, 6-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel starter Chuck Finley's eyes were fixed on the small TV monitor Friday 
night, his hand moving back and forth on the remote control. 
</P>
<P>
 Slow motion . . . fast forward . . . rewind. He watched the seven-second 
videotape segment of the Angels' 6-5 loss to the Boston Red Sox in disbelief, 
wondering how it could possibly happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, he had heard of such things, and there were plenty of people who had 
witnessed such a feat, but never did he imagine that one day it could happen to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 He can deal with guys hitting game-winning homers off him. He can cope with 
being hammered because of bad pitches. But not this. 
</P>
<P>
 Not someone stealing home. 
</P>
<P>
 Not with two out in the seventh inning with their team trailing by one run. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as much as Finley was hoping that fate would change each time he watched 
the videotape, there it was in living color: 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Hatcher, running on his own volition from third base, breaking toward 
home on a three-and-one pitch to Mo Vaughn, and sliding underneath the tag of 
catcher Greg Myers for the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
 Two innings later, Vaughn capitalized on the adventure by hitting a one-out, 
bases-loaded single into right field off Craig Lefferts for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatcher immediately was lauded as a fearless hero by the 25,870 fans at Fenway 
Park. The Angels (8-9) felt as if they had given away a game, despite staying 
in first place. And Finley, who remains winless in four starts, appeared as if 
he were ready to strangle someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's never happened to me in my life," Finley said, "and I guarantee it 
won't happen again. I'm not going to sit here and make excuses, but that never 
should have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, who watched his teammates recover from a 4-0 deficit with a five-run 
fourth inning, thought for sure he would win this game . . . right up until the 
moment Hatcher stole home. 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting a 5-4 lead, Hatcher began the seventh by walking on five pitches. 
He advanced to second base when Finley threw a pitch in the dirt that bounced 
away from Myers. And he went to third when Mike Greenwell grounded out to 
shortstop Gary DiSarcina. 
</P>
<P>
 Designated hitter Tim Naehring, who had already doubled and singled against 
Finley, needed to only hit the ball over a drawn-in infield to tie the score. 
Finley never gave him the chance, striking him out on a 2-2 fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, now able to take a deep breath, wasn't even concerning himself with 
Vaughn. The way he figured it, he could walk Vaughn with first base open and go 
after No. 6 hitter John Valentin. 
</P>
<P>
 Third baseman Damion Easley earlier warned Finley about Hatcher when Naehring 
was at the plate. Finley almost picked him off, but now he was simply 
concentrating on Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a peek at Hatcher before each of the first four pitches he threw to 
Vaughn, but was not bothering to hold him close. In fact, he wasn't pitching 
out of a stretch, going into his full delivery each time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought he might be jumping over there to get a balk," Finley said. "We 
knew that wasn't going to happen, but we didn't think the other would happen 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Myers: "I mean, we all knew it was possible, but it was way back in our 
heads. I mean, that's pretty rare. It's never happened to me. It's a gutsy 
thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel hitting coach Rod Carew, who stole home 17 times in his career 
including seven times in one season: "To me, it's the most exciting play in 
baseball. It can be one of the easiest bases to steal. But it was a stupid play 
the way they did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Vaughn had absolutely no idea that Hatcher was even coming. If he ball 
had come across the plate, he might have swung. Instead, he watched in 
disbelief like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up quickly," Vaughn said, "and all I could see was a big blue head 
coming right at me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hatcher, who last stole home two years ago: "Once I got my jump, all I 
prayed for was that Mo wouldn't swing." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn never moved, watching Hatcher get nearly three-quarters down the line 
when Finley delivered. He hurriedly threw a fastball low and away. Myers 
reached for it, slapped the tag, but Hatcher's left foot already was touching 
home plate.

AS USUAL, UCLA HAS A FULL CROP; NFL DRAFT: JAMIR MILLER HEADS BUSHEL OF BRUIN 
TALENT EXPECTED TO BE SELECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 He knew the first day, in Westchester, Pa., at training camp in July. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a little faster, but the players were the same size and nobody hit him 
any harder than he had been hit in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't ever get confident at training camp, especially when you're an 
undrafted free agent," Philadelphia Eagle defensive end Mike Chalenski said. 
"They throw you into the fire, right off the bat, but I felt pretty good 
because I had played against some of those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 That was when he was at UCLA, which had the most alumni in the NFL last 
season, 37, one more than USC and Miami. Florida State and Notre Dame had 30. 
</P>
<P>
 In the great American super market system that is the NFL draft, they are the 
stores most frequently shopped. By close of business Sunday, the first round 
will probably include UCLA linebacker Jamir Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the draft is finished, the names of UCLA guard Craig Novitsky, tackle 
Vaughn Parker, nose guard Bruce Walker and defensive back Marvin Goodwin will 
probably have been called. Linebacker Nkosi Littleton and defensive tackle Matt 
Werner may be tabbed by the pros too. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the end of a process that begins every September. Scouts crowd the film 
room at UCLA, then adjourn to Spalding Field to find new bodies to feed the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had as many as 30 of them in a small room, watching tape on three 
monitors," said Ken Norris, film coordinator at UCLA. "We send four or five 
game films to the NFL dubbing center to send to the 28 teams, but always they 
want more. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the agents want tape too. We sell it to the agents. A player will tell 
his agent the games he played well in, and the agent will get the tape from us 
and make a highlight film to sell his player to a team." 
</P>
<P>
 It's part of a job placement service the schools spend thousands of dollars to 
support. The idea is to make the process perpetuate itself. UCLA produces NFL 
players, so the Bruins recruit the kind of players who can move on to pro 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few kids that we recruit, at some point in their careers, don't aspire 
to that level," Coach Terry Donahue said. "Most kids want that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Many get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, big schools get big players," New England Patriot Coach Bill Parcells 
said. "If I want a big lineman, I'm more likely to find it at BC (Boston 
College) than BU (Division I-AA Boston University). That's not to say that you 
won't find them at Boston University, but you're more likely to find a skill 
player, a smaller player there." 
</P>
<P>
 You're more likely to find several of them at USC or UCLA or Miami or another 
of the few schools that seem to stamp out NFL players, as though on an assembly 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "They realize that in the Pac-10, we play the kind of offenses and defenses 
the pros use," said Bob Toledo, UCLA's offensive coordinator. "We throw the 
ball a lot, and that means linemen learn pass protection. In some programs that 
use the wishbone or the option, they're only learning run blocking. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're learning pass defense against passing teams too. It makes a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 College football is a product of a professional influence. UCLA assistants 
visit their professional counterparts for tips to help them beat Stanford -- 
and get a player ready for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 And geography helps. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take a kid from a small town in Alabama, then he plays at the state 
university, well, he's played big football but he hasn't lived in a big city," 
Toledo said. "Here, they've lived in Los Angeles. It probably makes the 
adjustment easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Big town or not, though, players from major programs have an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell them right away at training camp," said Chalenski. "The others' 
moves are a little 'rawer.' They used to dominate players at a smaller program 
with strength, but up here everybody is strong. I tried to use moves I had 
learned in college, and they worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Drafted Eagles were cut. Chalenski stayed and played on special teams and in 
specialty situations. 
</P>
<P>
 And became part of the lure the schools use to get more and better players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, why not?" said Miller, who is leaving college with a year of 
eligibility remaining. "You can't assume anything, but I'll get an opportunity. 
They mentioned it when they were recruiting me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Donahue: "We tell them they'll get a lot of exposure. They'll be on TV a 
lot. Pro scouts come on campus a lot. Lots of kids openly or quietly want to 
play in the NFL, and UCLA is a great springboard." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who aren't drafted, the chance to play still exists, and that chance 
is enhanced when the resume is stamped "major program." 
</P>
<P>
 The schools try to keep it that way. Selected players go to an NFL scouting 
combine tryout camp in Indianapolis to be tested, weighed and measured. UCLA 
goes the NFL one better, designating three days after the season and letting 
teams know that the players will be on hand, ready to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner, probably on the draft bubble, knows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will get a chance to show that I can play somewhere next season, either by 
being drafted or signing as a free agent," he said. "A lot of guys I've played 
against in the last five years have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Chalenski, his roommate at UCLA, told him. 
</P>
<P>
 As training camp drew to a close last season, the Eagles played the Atlanta 
Falcons. It was a critical time, with cuts looming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Atlanta had a tackle, Bob Whitfield," Chalenski said. "He played at Stanford, 
and I played against him in my sophomore and junior years at UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Made the team.

USC PAIR MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE; NFL DRAFT: BY STAYING IN SCHOOL, MORTON AND 
MCGINEST IMPROVED THEIR STOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their decisions were made two days apart in January, 1993. Johnnie Morton and 
Willie McGinest breathed deeply and announced they were returning for their 
senior seasons at USC and not declaring themselves eligible for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Academicians applauded. In this era of mad dashes from class to cash, staying 
in school was politically correct. 
</P>
<P>
 If not financially ruinous. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing up millions as prospective first-round picks, the two USC stars walked 
a financial tightrope to stay and complete their educations while putting more 
money into the coffers of the beloved university. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, nobility can't hold reservations on NFL draft boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Sean LaChapelle, the cross-town rival receiver from UCLA, who lost a small 
fortune when he returned to school after a sensational junior season, only to 
be slowed by injuries his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 LaChapelle's NFL stock dropped like a rock, and he ended up a fifth-round pick 
with the Rams in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It stayed in the back of my mind a lot, coming back," McGinest admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton, the acrobatic receiver, and McGinest, the menacing defensive end, 
returned knowing one severe ankle turn could foil their futures. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, fate has been kind. Both survived intact. 
</P>
<P>
 And both claim to be better men and players for having stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm twice the player I was last year," Morton boasts proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 By staying, Morton and McGinest appear to have only improved their potential 
in Sunday's NFL draft. Both are virtual first-round locks. Morton figures to go 
anywhere from No. 10 through 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a dozen teams could use him. Many have him pegged for the New York Jets 
at pick No. 13. But if dreams really do come true, Morton will end up with the 
Pittsburgh Steelers on the 17th pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton has fashioned his style after Lynn Swann, the former USC and Steeler 
star. 
</P>
<P>
 "He inspired me to play," Morton said. "I was a running back before watching 
those Super Bowls when he was making all those catches. I tried to do that on 
the playgrounds and developed into a receiver. That would be something, me 
going from USC to Pittsburgh. If it happens, you'll have to tell ABC to get 
ready. I'll probably go there too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers like Morton, although they aren't ready to dub him son of Swann. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to compare a college wide receiver with a receiver who should be in 
the Hall of Fame," Tom Donahoe, Steeler director of football operations, said. 
"But the one thing that impresses us about (Morton) is his ability to go after 
the ball and catch the ball. Lynn was a fearless player. You can see some of 
the same in Johnnie." 
</P>
<P>
 McGinest, on the other hand, has been moving up the draft board like a hit pop 
single on the Billboard charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his production fell off -- from 16 sacks as a junior to six last 
season -- McGinest has been dropping jaws around the league with his impressive 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Having added about 10 pounds to his 6-foot-6 frame, the 255-pound McGinest is 
now projected to go as high as No. 4, to New England. Though it appears now the 
Rams won't use their fifth pick on McGinest, they rave about his potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very, very hot item in this draft," said, John Becker, the Rams' 
personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan, the Arizona Cardinals' coach, might agree to have his jaw wired to 
get McGinest, an intriguing outside linebacker-defensive end hybrid in the 
Charles Haley mold. The Cardinals have the 10th pick and might be willing to 
trade up. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his agent, McGinest has been timed at 4.46 and 4.48 seconds in 
the 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be blind not to see," one NFC personnel man said. "Let's say 
three or four scouts are debating this guy, and you've got some who are 
negative. All you do is say, 'Come on over Willie, let's see what you can do.' 
All doubters look like idiots." 
</P>
<P>
 The scouts also think Morton and McGinest polished their skills with an 
additional season, likening USC to NFL finishing school. 
</P>
<P>
 The players credit John Robinson, who returned to coach USC after 10 seasons 
with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Using pro-style techniques with the Trojans made his two stars better NFL 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton returned to put an exclamation point on his great USC career with a 
senior season in which he caught 88 passes for 1,520 yards and 14 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He was named USC's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 He leaves as the Trojans' leading receiver with 201 catches, 3,201 yards and 
23 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made me All-American," Morton said of Robinson and receiver coach Mike 
Sanford. "They showcased me, let me do things I can do. I wish (Robinson) could 
coach me the rest of my career. He knows how to make you play your best, and 
how to handle you off the field. In a way, it's sad. He made my last year my 
best year." 
</P>
<P>
 The handling of McGinest appeared curious at first. After two years at 
linebacker, McGinest was moved to defensive end by Robinson. McGinest's sack 
totals fell off dramatically, but he had a solid season otherwise and is now 
even more intriguing to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 What position will he play? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people see him as an outside pass rusher, others as an outside 
linebacker," said Bob Ackles, the Cardinals' assistant general manager. "It'll 
be interesting to see where he plays and how he plays. It's hard to say." 
</P>
<P>
 McGinest said he became a more complete player under Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brought the pro style to our team," McGinest said. "He told us what we 
needed to do. He brought that atmosphere. He's been there. He gave me a lot of 
insight. You're always learning." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, about the only regret Morton and McGinest had about staying in school 
was the time they had to kill this week waiting for draft day. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton has already graduated, with a degree in communications. You might have 
seen him last week, flipping through magazines at bookstores around town. 
</P>
<P>
 "'It doesn't seem real," Morton said of the prospect of being a prospect. "It 
seems like so far away. I can't comprehend it. Kids dream of playing in the 
NFL. To actually have your dream come true. . . . I won't realize it until 
after the draft, the first day of mini-camp. Running on the grass. Maybe it 
will hit me." 
</P>
<P>
 McGinest is two classes short of his degree in public administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrets? He's had a few. Returning to school isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main objective was finishing up school and improving my skills," he said. 
"I'm glad everything panned out."

GYMNASTICS / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; MILLER REPEATS IN THE ALL-AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Shannon Miller needed to perform, she performed brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old from Edmond, Okla., completed two spectacular vaults Friday 
night to win the women's all-around title at the World Gymnastics Championships 
for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller needed to score 9.775 with her two vaults to win -- and she scored 
9.812. 
</P>
<P>
 She totaled 39.274 points for the four disciplines in retaining the title she 
won last year at Birmingham, England. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a remarkable performance considering she was suffered a stomach muscle 
injury last month and missed two weeks of training. 
</P>
<P>
 "It meant a lot to win last year because it was my first time, but this means 
even more because I had to come back from injuries," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavinia Milosovici of Romania won the silver medal with a score of 39.236 -- 
only 0.038 behind. Dina Kochetkova of Russia was third with a total of 39.125. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller scored 9.850 on the uneven bars, 9.862 on the balance beam and 9.750 
for her floor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 The last woman to win consecutive all-around world titles was Ludmilla 
Tourischeva of the Soviet Union in 1970 and 1974, when the championships were 
held every four years. Only four women ever have achieved the feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's victory did not surprise Coach Steve Nunno, who was confident despite 
the gymnast's inconsistent training form. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen this movie before," Nunno said. "A lot of people counted Shannon 
out, but I know what makes her tick and I knew she was going to give 100% and a 
valiant effort, if not a gold medal. We look at pressure as a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said she was unaware of what she needed to score with her final vaults. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at the board," she said. "I'm focused on my routines. I just 
knew I had to do the two best vaults I could and leave the rest to the judges." 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Gogean of Romania finished fourth with 39.061 points, and Dominique 
Dawes, 17, of Silver Spring, Md., was fifth with 38.968. Dawes was the 
co-leader after three routines but stumbled on the first of her two vaults, 
scoring only 9.250. She improved with her second vault for an average of 9.506, 
but had lost her chance.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE MIGHT WANT TO BONE UP ON MUTUAL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, serving a 6 1/2-year sentence 
at the Indiana Youth Center outside Indianapolis on a rape conviction, recently 
failed a high school equivalency exam, reportedly falling short on the math 
portion of the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, though, what kind of a math test does a guy in Tyson's line of 
work really need to pass, anyway?" wrote Ron Borges of the Boston Globe. "All 
he needs to do is count to 10. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "This is not to say there is no place for algebraic concepts in Tyson's life. 
Certainly, a question or two involving negative numbers, which allegedly were 
part of the exam that baffled him, would be something important for him to 
master. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be especially true when Don King is his promoter." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What NBA team has the highest winning percentage in the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 Practice makes perfect: Said Bret Saberhagen of the New York Mets, who played 
himself in a movie called "The Scout:" "They shot me pitching to this kid, a 
phenom. I just pitched and then looked over my shoulder. That was easy, I've 
done that six times in the last two games I've pitched." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfinished business: Ray Bourque of the Boston Bruins, a four-time winner of 
the Norris Trophy as the NHL's best defenseman, told the Boston Globe: "You 
look at what I've done over 15 years, and one thing jumps out. I haven't played 
on a Stanley Cup champion." 
</P>
<P>
 Ugly American: Said catcher Joe Oliver of the Cincinnati Reds, after having 
X-rays taken at a Montreal hospital: "I got a look at socialized medicine, and 
if that's the future, I want no part of it. I felt like Fred Flintstone. I 
expected that a woodpecker would peck out the X-ray." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of a kind: Upon meeting Bob Gainey last summer, Randy Galloway of the 
Dallas Morning News told the Dallas Star coach: "Bob, I don't know that much 
about the NHL, but give me two weeks and I'll be an expert." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gainey: "I've met your type before, but usually it's an owner." 
</P>
<P>
 New life: Wimp Sanderson, who became basketball coach at Arkansas Little Rock 
last week, was still coaching at Alabama when he said: "I've been here so long 
that when I got here, the Dead Sea wasn't even sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The Lakers, with a .598 winning percentage. The Boston Celtics' 
playoff winning percentage is .593. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Xabier Azkargorta, coach of the Bolivian soccer team, after two of 
the nation's first-division clubs refused to release their players to train for 
his World Cup team: "I'm as baffled as Adam on Mother's Day." JERRY CROWE

UCLA ALUMNI UPSET ABOUT DISTRIBUTION OF ROSE BOWL TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I question UCLA Athletic Director Peter Dalis' statement regarding the sale of 
4,000 Rose Bowl tickets to Angelo Mazzone that, on Dec. 1, after adding up the 
prospects for ticket sales, he then realized he was well short of selling 
UCLA's ticket allotment. 
</P>
<P>
 First, orders from season-ticket holders did not have to be mailed until after 
Dec. 1 so he could not have known what the demand was. Second, UCLA was doing 
everything possible to discourage the sale of extra tickets to season-ticket 
holders and alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 I had hoped to buy four extra tickets for Christmas gifts. Before Dec. 1, I 
was told by the UCLA ticket office and the Alumni Assn. that they were 
unavailable. The season-ticket holder application said that we were entitled to 
two additional tickets, if available, but I was told that even then it was 
unlikely that we would get them. 
</P>
<P>
 I was literally surrounded by Wisconsin fans at the game. Now I know why. I 
suspect that 4,000 tickets included many of the best seats available. I suspect 
the sale was set up well before Dec. 1 and UCLA alumni and supporters were 
robbed of the opportunity of going to the game. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I have been a UCLA football season-ticket holder for nearly 20 years. After 
the more recent lackluster football history at my alma mater, I was ecstatic 
when, this year, the Bruins finally made it back to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, I was dismayed when told, as were all season-ticket holders, 
that I would not be able to buy even a single additional ticket to the 
UCLA-Wisconsin Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that I am required to purchase membership in various support groups to 
even keep my seat location, I found this "extortion" policy upsetting. 
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone agree with the UCLA official who says there is no ethical issue 
involved? 
</P>
<P>
 It is obvious there must be an investigation to determine the legal, financial 
and ethical activities of the UCLA athletic administration.

REALIGNMENT IS PAYING DIVIDEND FOR DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The baseball realignment was contrived so more teams would be in contention 
and there'll be more playoff games for television.While it destroys the 
integrity of the sport, still some good has resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Just think what would have happened had the divisions remained the same. The 
Dodgers, after only 11 contests, would be 7 1/2 behind the Braves.

THEY DON'T FORGET THE SACK OF ROME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Dufresne's commentary on Jim Rome was right on the mark.Not only was 
Rome guilty of goading Jim Everett, his self-defense skills were pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 The frozen-with-terror look in Rome's eyes as Everett approached was the most 
laughable attempt at fisticuffs since Prince duked it out with Clarence 
Williams III in "Purple Rain." "Pick on someone your own size!" could never be 
applied to Rome. He would probably be an underdog in a bout with Richard 
Simmons. Thanks for the memory, Van Smack.

LEFT ALONE, HOLY BULL WILL HAVE EASY TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holy Bull's exploits have the connections of his mortal rivals quaking in 
their boots, even though the Derby is weeks away! 
</P>
<P>
 If they send their horses after this speedster, they might implode before Holy 
Bull does, so it appears they have mutually decided to wait and let him keep 
running until he gets tired and stops. If they keep to this strategy, they are 
in for a long wait, and history may find itself a 12th Triple Crown winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all they have to do is ask among themselves, who's willing to sacrifice 
his horse, as a "rabbit" to burn the Bull out.

 If all else fails, is Paul Pilkinton available?

TRIAL COACHING STINT DOESN'T QUITE CUT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I realize this is Los Angeles and Magic Johnson is held a notch higher than 
God in esteem, but how about a little "objectivity in reporting?" 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson took over the Lakers on a lark. He took the job on a trial basis -- 
sort of like ordering a Ginsu knife. I guess. His "commitment to coaching the 
Lakers" was superseded by other plans "he just couldn't get out of," causing 
him to miss the Portland game. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Lakers had a shot to catch the Nuggets, he was all smiles, talking 
about "how much he liked this group of guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Lakers went into the tank and Johnson announced he wouldn't be back, 
which just happened to coincide with the Lakers' elimination from the playoffs. 
He then called the players quitters and went on to talk about how NBA players 
have gotten petty and selfish since he left the league. 
</P>
<P>
 If Johnson's "coaching career" was anything more than a batch of soggy, 
nostalgic hype, show me one shred of proof. This isn't basketball, it's high 
farce. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Lakers tip off in November, they'll be shown another system by 
another coach. Maybe the next one will make up his mind that he wants to stick 
around for a few games before he hits the hardwood.

 I was certain when I read Sunday's headline "Me-Me-Me-Me . . . ," someone was 
finally going to expose the selfish behavior of Magic Johnson. But no, it was 
about the players' selfish attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I suppose it isn't selfish of Magic to make his comeback as a player or 
to make his debut as a coach to see if he liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a thought, but maybe the players weren't buying Magic's motivation 
techniques, and there always is that threat of the players running the coach 
off. Remember Westhead (Magic does) or Riley? Maybe now Magic will stop 
disrupting the rebuilding process and perform his final act and disappear.

 Magic Johnson would be well advised to paraphrase a line from General 
MacArthur . . . "Old basketball players should just fade away." -- "I'll never 
play again, yeah, I'm going to play again, no I'm not, I'm going to coach, no 
I'm not!"

 Given Magic Johnson's recent struggles with the Lakers, there must be 
considerable consternation throughout the area: Suddenly, coaching might not be 
as easy as it was thought to be. Now, whom to blame? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Jim Harrick should go on sabbatical for a year and let Bill Walton 
have a crack at coaching the Bruins. The result might shut up a lot of people.

CLIPPERS GO DOWN FIGHTING TO SUNS; PRO BASKETBALL: AFTER TRAILING BY 19 POINTS, 
L.A. STAGES A RALLY BEFORE LOSING, 127-121. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers weren't at full strength, and that kind of opponent has been a 
problem for the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Suns pulled it out with a 10-0 run at the start of the third 
quarter, beating the Clippers, 127-121, Friday night. Phoenix clinched third 
place in the West when Seattle beat San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough game to play in, because it's the last couple of games, but 
they're very important," said Dan Majerle, who went end to end for a layup 
after a steal to complete the surge that gave Phoenix its biggest lead of the 
game -- 83-64 -- with 9:34 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers were stubborn all night and got back within eight points, 95-87, 
on a dunk by Loy Vaught with 3:52 to go in the third, but Phoenix managed to 
lead 104-90 when the period ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Majerle, who had 24 points, got the last of them on a three-point play 
with 8:35 left, sending the Suns to a 114-97 lead that the Clippers couldn't 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played our hearts out," Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said. "We hung 
in there when we could have been completely blown out." 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix, which won its sixth straight and 10th in a row at home, swept the 
series this season after the Clippers won it 3-2 last season when the Suns had 
the NBA's best record. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Suns didn't have to face Dominique Wilkins in the two games they had 
left after the Clippers acquired the nine-time All-Star. Ron Harper also missed 
the game. Both were out with back injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaught scored 29 points, hitting 14 of 18 shots. Terry Dehere had 19 points, 
and Gary Grant 17 for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A.C. Green led the Suns to a 43-33 rebounding edge, pulling down 16 to go with 
his 19 points. Mark West and Cedric Ceballos had 17 points apiece, and Kevin 
Johnson had all of his 15 points and 13 assists in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to let this game get away. The main objective was to get the 
win," Coach Paul Westphal said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers lost their fifth straight road game, finishing the season 10-31 
away from home, but not without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead changed hands eight times in the first half, and the Suns never could 
take a double-digit lead in the first 24 minutes.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; CAVALLINI GIVES STARS OVERTIME VICTORY, 5-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Cavallini has turned into a scoring machine in the playoffs, and it's no 
coincidence it's coming against his former team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could say this is my lucky day," Cavallini said after his power-play goal 
at 8:34 of overtime gave the Dallas Stars a 5-4 victory over the St. Louis 
Blues Friday night at St. Louis. "It's great to come back here and do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavallini, who played for the Blues from 1987-92, helped the Stars take a 
commanding 3-0 lead in their first-round series with a 40-foot drive for his 
first goal of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just shot it on the net as hard as I could," Cavallini said. "It's like 
five years of frustration finally coming out." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavallini added a second-period assist and has a goal and five assists in the 
series. He scored 44 points in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stars, who won despite getting outshot, 48-31, go for the sweep in Game 4 
Sunday in St. Louis. Only two teams in NHL history have come back from 3-0 
deficits in the playoffs, the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs against Detroit for the 
Stanley Cup and the 1975 New York Islanders against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams combined for three goals in the final 6:13 of regulation, and the 
Blues forced the extra period on Alexei Kasatonov's second goal of the playoffs 
with 28 seconds to go. St. Louis had six attackers on the ice when Kasatonov 
intercepted a clearing pass and scored from the left circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 3, San Jose 2 -- Rookie Chris Osgood continued his mastery over the 
Sharks, stopping 22 of 24 shots at San Jose, as the Red Wings took a 2-1 lead 
in the best-of-seven first-round Western Conference series. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a shutout in Game 2, Osgood wasn't perfect this time, but he was 
close. Osgood, who stopped 22 shots in Game 2 and blanked the Sharks the only 
previous time he faced them, didn't give up a goal until late in the second 
period, ending a streak of more than 157 scoreless minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren McCarty, Dino Ciccarelli and Shawn Burr scored early goals for the Red 
Wings, who had their own problems against San Jose goalie Arturs Irbe, who 
turned back 27 of 30 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 4, Vancouver 2 -- Theoren Fleury scored twice in a four-goal third 
period at Vancouver, as the Flames took a 2-1 lead in their Western Conference 
quarterfinal series with the Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Walz and Gary Roberts also scored for Calgary, which played the third 
period without centers Joe Nieuwendyk And Joel Otto, who suffered apparent knee 
injuries late in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Vernon made 26 saves for the Flames, who regained home-ice advantage in 
the best-of-seven series, which continues Sunday at Vancouver.

CANADIENS' ROY STILL HOSPITALIZED, AWAITS WORD ON APPENDECTOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The get-well wishes poured in for Patrick Roy, but there was no indication 
Friday whether the star goaltender would be back in time to save the Montreal 
Canadiens from playoff elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy remained in the hospital for a second day after doctors postponed a 
decision on whether to remove his aching appendix. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrick's condition is much improved," the Canadiens announced in a 
statement. "He has resumed eating and will remain in hospital for an additional 
24 hours observation and intravenous antibiotics treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 A team of doctors will decide whether to operate, which would sideline Roy for 
about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the antibiotics control the swelling, Coach Jacques Demers said it 
is unlikely Roy will be able to play tonight in Game 4 of Montreal's playoff 
series against Boston. The Bruins lead, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had got out of hospital, I'd be optimistic," Demers said. "But he's 
still on intravenous. I've told (backup goaltender) Ron Tugnutt he's playing."

LIKE FATHER AND LIKE SON? HOLY BULL STILL HAS DOUBTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL MORAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His pedigree says no. Holy Bull's family tree is not easily mistaken for 
equine royalty. Until he came along, the offspring of Great Above -- and there 
are scores of them -- had never won a Grade I stakes, let alone the Kentucky 
Derby. But Holy Bull, whether at rest or in full stride, resembles no other son 
of Great Above. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, they are not huge, long-bodied, thickly muscled colts. Holy Bull is 
all those things. Typically, they are not blessed with the effortless speed 
with which Holy Bull now seems to intimidate his opponents, human and equine. 
Typically, they do not stay 9 furlongs. Holy Bull has done that twice now 
without finding it necessary to pass another horse. Typically, they lack the 
ground-swallowing stride with which Holy Bull has dominated the Florida Derby 
and Blue Grass Stakes in his past two starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, 10 furlongs, the distance of the Kentucky Derby, is a quantum leap 
beyond the range of those who claim Great Above as a parent. There are those 
who believe Holy Bull will arrive at the Derby with genes that don't fit and be 
exposed as a miler in the guise of a classic horse, but their ranks thinned 
after the Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull made a legion of believers at Keeneland on Saturday. His presence 
and his running style are charismatic and this is a time of year in which 
charisma becomes a factor in the gush of hype that precedes the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he has to be in front (to run his best)," jockey Mike Smith 
said after the Blue Grass. "He's there because he can be." Trainer Jimmy Croll 
said his pre-race strategy has not been to send this animal to the lead. "He 
just takes us there." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear exactly where Holy Bull is taking us. In the harsh light of 
reality, he enjoyed another unmolested lead in the Blue Grass and set a 
strolling pace. In the end, he had more than ample energy in reserve. In 
Florida, no challenge materialized. Here, there was only a tepid challenge from 
Valiant Nature, who was hard-used in the process of drawing within a length of 
Holy Bull, who finished as strongly as he did in Florida. Again, Smith rode him 
through the wire in the interest of conditioning. In either case, the late 
runners at the mercy of pace were left helpless. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had it all his own way. They left him alone on the lead, which I couldn't 
believe," said Craig Perret, who rode Louisiana Derby winner Kandaly, one of 
those at the mercy of pace. "When he comes to the Derby, he'll have two or 
three other horses going with him. He won't have it this easy in the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
 So, is this a genetic freak? Has an unbridled giant been born from a family of 
dwarfs? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to call him a great horse," said Laffit Pincay, who rode 
Valiant Nature and, in many eyes, was far too late in taking the race to Holy 
Bull. "Let's wait until after the Derby for that. A horse usually doesn't have 
it this easy in the Kentucky Derby. Next time, two or three horses will go with 
him. Next time, I'll be closer to the pace." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wood Memorial will send only its first two finishers to Louisville. Irgun, 
who was even more impressive at Aqueduct on Saturday than he was in the Gotham, 
is an emerging star, as physically imposing as Holy Bull, blessed with speed, 
perhaps greater versatility and the kind of pedigree lacking in the Derby 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Go for Gin ran well enough in the Wood to earn the trip to Churchill, but left 
the impression he is not likely to relish 10 furlongs. Santa Anita Derby winner 
Brocco will be a major player, and another handful of Derby starters, including 
San Felipe Stakes winner Soul of the Matter, will prep in this weekend's 
Arkansas Derby and Lexington Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter who shows up in Louisville, Holy Bull will hold center stage. 
He's the favorite. The horse to beat. The main speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he is," said trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who will go to Louisville with 
Santa Anita Derby runner-up Tabasco Cat, "is a pain in the (butt) for all of 
us."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MCDONALD, SMITH LEAD ORIOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lee Smith got his eighth save quicker than anyone else, and Ben McDonald 
became the American League's first four-game winner as the Baltimore Orioles 
defeated the Seattle Mariners, 6-4, Friday at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald has won all four of his starts, and Smith has saves in each of his 
eight appearances. The 36-year-old reliever also has an 0.00 ERA over seven 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald gave up eight hits and three earned runs in 6 2/3 innings. He struck 
out three and walked one in becoming the first Oriole since Jeff Ballard in 
1989 to win his first four starts in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Jefferson went three for four with a homer for the Mariners, who have 
allowed a major league high 20 unearned runs in 14 games, compared to 53 
unearned runs all last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 7, Cleveland 3 -- Juan Gonzalez hit a bases-loaded pop fly that dropped 
for a tiebreaking two-run single at Arlington, Tex., as the Rangers ended a 
four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied 3-3 in the seventh, Indian third baseman Jim Thome called 
off shortstop Alvaro Espinoza on the two-out fly but then backed off at the 
last second and the ball dropped without being touched as Manuel Lee and David 
Hulse scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Morris (1-2) gave up seven runs and nine hits in 6 2/3 innings. Kenny 
Rogers (1-2) became only the second Texas starter to win this year, giving up 
three runs and nine hits in eight innings with six strikeouts and three walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 9, Kansas City 8 -- Dave Nilsson hit a two-run double in the ninth 
inning at Milwaukee, as the Brewers rallied and ended the Royals' 151-game 
streak of holding leads after eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals' streak was the longest of that type in 50 years. The last time 
Kansas City wasted a lead after eight was Aug. 25, 1991, against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, Detroit 2 -- Robin Ventura hit a three-run home run and Frank 
Thomas hit his seventh homer in 10 games, at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Sanderson (2-0) gave up both runs and four hits in seven innings for 
Chicago, which has 31 home runs in 16 games. Sanderson has given up only two 
earned runs in 13 innings for a 1.38 ERA.

 New York 8, Oakland 6 -- Luis Polonia doubled in Bernie Williams with the 
go-ahead run in the sixth inning at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who returned to the Yankee lineup after missing two games while in 
Puerto Rico for the birth of his daughter, hit a two-run homer to cap a 
four-run second and also walked and scored when New York scored twice in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Kamieniecki (1-0), the second of four Yankee pitchers, allowed two runs 
and five hits in 3 2/3 innings in relief of Bob Ojeda, who made his first start 
at Yankee Stadium since signing with New York on Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 8, Minnesota 2 -- Pat Hentgen pitched a five-hitter, and Joe Carter 
went three for five with a home run at Toronto, as the Blue Jays extended their 
winning streak to five. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter homered in his first at-bat against Scott Erickson (1-3) since the Twin 
starter broke Carter's thumb with a pitch during spring training. Carter ran 
the bases slowly and stared at Erickson after rounding third.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; GOTT STILL CAN'T FIND THE GROOVE

 Just when he thought he was back in the groove, Jim Gott gave up a two-run 
homer to Ryan Thompson on Thursday night, prompting phone calls from concerned 
friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are calling and saying, 'What's the deal? Is your arm OK?' " Gott said 
Friday. "That's the first thing everybody wants to know. Well, my arm is 
awesome. I am just looking to get in a groove, and it's a very hard thing for 
me to go through right now. I'm in a slump, just like a hitter gets in a slump. 
I thought I was coming out of it and then, boom -- you can't explain any of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 In eight appearances and 9 1/3 innings, Gott has given up seven earned runs, 
including two home runs, and hit three batters and walked four. Friday night, 
he got into a jam in the eighth inning but pitched out. 
</P>
<P>
 His struggles started in spring training, when, adjusting to the set-up role 
after a successful season as a closer, he tried to pitch too fine.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to be Orel (Hershiser) or something, and that's not me," Gott 
said. "I wasn't aggressive enough. But then I started to get aggressive and 
pitch well and was feeling better than ever. Then I go out last night and walk 
a guy and give up the home run on a good pitch. Six of my seven earned runs 
have been at home. It's all in my head, but I will work out of it. " 
</P>

 A fan watching batting practice from the left-field pavilion before Friday 
night's game fell over the rail and landed about 15 feet below in the Dodger 
bullpen. Melvin Augusta, 19, of Los Angeles, was taken by ambulance to USC 
County Hospital. He suffered a contusion to his left hip, was treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Augusta, standing about four rows up, was leaning over the rail over the 
bullpen when he fell. He caught himself and tried to hang before falling flat 
on his back. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Third base coach Joe Amalfitano said that Tim Wallach, who was thrown out at 
third base in the fourth inning of Thursday night's game, was not attempting to 
steal, as widely reported. With Eric Karros at bat, Wallach and Henry Rodriguez 
were running on a hit-and-run play, but the pitch thrown to Karros was a low 
breaking ball, and a bad pitch for him to hit. 
</P>

 Carlos Hernandez was activated and Tom Prince sent to triple-A Albuquerque. 
Hernandez, who was in Florida rehabilitating a sprained back, said he actually 
had fun there, playing with rookies. "It reminded me of my days as a rookie," 
he said, "but no more." Hernandez also had arthroscopic surgery on his shoulder 
in November. MARYANN HUDSON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Butcher, originally projected as the bullpen stopper this season, is 
expected to be demoted this weekend to Vancouver, the Angels' triple-A 
affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had hoped they could resolve Butcher's problems during this trip, 
but after his outing Thursday night against the Baltimore Orioles, they decided 
he needs to refine his skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher probably will be replaced by veteran John Farrell, who is 1-2 with a 
3.15 ERA at Vancouver and has struck out 18 in 20 innings. The Angels also are 
considering Russ Springer.

 John Wathan, Boston Red Sox bullpen coach, managed and won his first game 
Thursday since 1992, when he was interim manager of the Angels after the bus 
crash. He filled in for Manager Butch Hobson, who was in Alabama to attend his 
grandfather's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wathan is considered a candidate to replace Hobson if he is fired, 
Wathan is playing down speculation. "We talked about it a lot," Wathan said. "I 
told (Hobson) I'm not here to take his job, and I think he has gained 
confidence in me." BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Hector Lopez, the 1984 Olympic silver medalist who has steadied his career 
after several bouts with the law and drug abuse, says that his fight against 
Rod Sequenan tonight at the Olympic Auditorium will be very different from the 
Oscar De La Hoya-Jimmi Bredahl chase-and-run bout that opened the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be like when those two girls fought March 5," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez (25-3-1, 12 knockouts), known for his aggressive fighting style, is the 
No. 9-ranked junior-welterweight in the World Boxing Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, 27, was suspended for testing positive for drug use after a fight last 
summer and went through a drug-rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
 He since has lost a decision to Russian Konstantin Tszyu in January and 
sparred with Rafael Ruelas in helping to prepare Ruelas for his victory over 
International Boxing Federation lightweight champion Freddie Pendleton in 
February.

 Sequenan, 33, is 56-22-5 with 32 knockouts. TIM KAWAKAMI

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Conway's two-run single helped Texas beat Grand Canyon, 10-1, Friday 
night and give Longhorn Coach Cliff Gustafson the career record for Division I 
college baseball victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson has 1,333, putting him one ahead of Rod Dedeaux, who was 
1,332-571-11 in 45 years at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson, 63, needed 258 fewer games to reach Dedeaux's mark. He is 
1,333-325-2 in 27 years at Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas, which trailed by 1-0 early in the game, moved in front with a three-run 
sixth inning, sparked by Conway's two-run single.

NFL'S NO. 1 DRAFT PICKS HAVEN'T ALWAYS SUCCEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOM AMORE, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tension had been building for weeks. Which quarterback would the New 
England Patriots take, Drew Bledsoe or Rick Mirer? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Parcells, the new coach, decided weeks before, but never tipped his hand. 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue finally ended the drama, telling the crowd at the 
Marriott Marquis on Broadway, and the national TV audience, that Bledsoe, of 
Washington State, would be the choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought (being taken No. 1 in the NFL draft) made you something 
special," Bledsoe said on April 25, 1993. "But now that it's me, I realize it's 
no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The man who founded the exclusive club that now beckoned Bledsoe would have to 
agree. Certainly the first draft, in February 1936, was no gala. More like a 
penny-ante poker game. Nine cigar-puffing, mogul wannabees, some of whom were 
paying their players with IOUs, met at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Philadelphia, 
stubbornly trying to salvage their dream of professional football. Bert Bell, 
whose Philadelphia Eagles were the worst team in the NFL, sold the other owners 
on a system in which teams would pick players in the reverse order of the 
standings -- no more self-defeating bidding wars for the top college players. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as now, picking first did not guarantee success. Bell chose halfback Jay 
Berwanger of the University of Chicago, winner of the first Heisman Trophy, and 
dealt his rights to the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out I was drafted by reading it in the newspaper," said Berwanger, 
80, from his home in Illinois this week. "I didn't even know the draft was 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble was, Berwanger wanted a real job. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no money in it," he said of pro football. "It wasn't until years 
later (1945) when that receiver, (No. 1 pick Charley) Trippi, signed with the 
Cardinals for $100,000 for three years. That's when it started to amount to 
something. My timing was all wrong, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Some time after the first draft, Berwanger met Bears owner George Halas in the 
lobby of a downtown Chicago hotel, both heading to a party. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked what I wanted," Berwanger said, "and I had my tongue in my cheek. I 
told him, $25,000 for two years. He looked at my date and said, 'Nice to have 
met you, have a nice time tonight.' And that was the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Halas gave up and "Breakaway Jay," the first of the firsts, never played pro 
football, making a comfortable living in plastics and foam rubber manufacturing 
instead. Typical. Of the 58 players taken first in the NFL and AFL drafts, only 
eight are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. A handful of others had great 
careers and may make it someday, and a few active players, such as quarterbacks 
John Elway (1983) of the Broncos and Troy Aikman (1989) of the Cowboys and 
defensive end Bruce Smith (1985) of the Bills, could make it. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't take Bledsoe's word. Much goes with being the No. 1 pick. It's a lot 
to live up to. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor that never goes away," said agent Leigh Steinberg, who has 
represented four of the past five No. 1s, including Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mantle the player carries with him for the rest of his life. And of 
course, it carries with it great expectations for productivity." 
</P>
<P>
 Then and now, picking first guarantees nothing but expectations. Maybe Ohio 
State defensive lineman Dan Wilkinson -- yes, a Steinberg client -- who will 
probably be taken first in the 59th draft Sunday, will be another Bruce or 
Bubba Smith (Colts, 1967). Maybe he won't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up, watching people on TV," Bledsoe said, "you get the impression 
these people are superhuman and different than everybody else. To go from being 
in high school to being an NFL player in four years, it was kind of a shock to 
be there and to be the same guy I was in high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe had a successful rookie year, as the Patriots improved from 2-14 to 
5-11 and raised fans' hopes. Since the team picking first is usually a bad 
team, it's looking for a savior -- a player who possesses special talent and 
the ability to carry the burden that goes with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People try to (put extra pressure) on you," Bledsoe said. "The only pressure 
I get is from myself. I don't tend to take myself too seriously, or the media 
too seriously. There were expectations. I didn't allow that to get in my head 
too much. It's something you just have to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Steinberg: "A lot has to do with self-image. These players have to have a 
supreme amount of self-confidence. One trait they all have is the desire to be 
in the center of activity, to be the decision-makers that win or lose games, to 
be the lead actor. Troy Aikman has that, Drew Bledsoe has it and Dan Wilkinson 
has it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jets general manager Dick Steinberg had to make the big choice twice during 
his days with the Patriots, taking defensive lineman Kenneth Sims in 1982 and 
wide receiver Irving Fryar in '84. 
</P>
<P>
 "You keep coming up with the word 'pressure,' " Dick Steinberg said testily. 
"This is a business where there is always pressure. You're dealing with a human 
element that is very hard to evaluate. You hope to reduce the odds of failure 
by learning as much as you can about the players you're considering, but that's 
about all you can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media loves to create pressure, it thrives on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the first pick of the draft is not the make-or-break decision, for the 
franchise or player, the media makes it out to be. Few remember, for instance, 
that Vince Lombardi, in one of his first acts with the Packers, made a poor No. 
1 pick in the 1959 draft. Unhappy with the quarterback situation he inherited, 
he took Randy Duncan of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan, deterred by Green Bay's 1-10-1 record in 1958, convinced the rookie 
coach would make little difference and fearing he was too small to play in the 
NFL, went to Canada and left Lombardi with a wasted pick. Stuck with incumbent 
quarterback Bart Starr, Lombardi went on to win five championships; he and 
Starr are in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the CFL is only one option. The first pick can negotiate beforehand and 
can often force a team to trade the pick, as did quarterback John Elway, who 
forced the Colts to trade him to Denver in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's another factor in all this," Leigh Steinberg said. "The first player 
picked has to be ready to negotiate before the others, and he is often dealing 
with several teams. He has some control in where he goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, there (are) the financial rewards involved -- Drew Bledsoe got $4.5 
million (his first year), so fans are not going to show the patience they 
normally would with a young player. There will be some resentment. The player 
has to be prepared for that."

RIGHT JAB WAS MOORER'S BEST WEAPON; BOXING: LEFT-HANDER OUTBOXES HOLYFIELD, WHO 
DOESN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT CONTROVERSIAL DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the only heavyweight championship fight ever won by a right jab. 
</P>
<P>
 By design, it was Michael Moorer's most important weapon Friday night when he 
outboxed Evander Holyfield to become the first left-handed champion in the 
history of the sport's most glamorous division. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were saying we had a puncher's chance," said Moorer's trainer, Teddy 
Atlas. "I didn't look at it that way. He would control the fight with the jab. 
If he didn't, his chances would be reduced to a knockout, and that's like the 
lottery." 
</P>
<P>
 It developed that the only knockdown punch was delivered by Holyfield late in 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 A right-left combination put Moorer on his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked myself, 'What the hell am I doing here?' " Moorer said. "He put two 
good punches together. I was stunned but not hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer had dominated the first two minutes of the round, leading to some 
curious mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 Two judges gave Holyfield only a one-point advantage in the round, and the 
other, Jerry Roth, scored it even. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that Roth had Moorer winning by only one point, it wouldn't have 
been surprising to hear cries of robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holyfield registered no gripes with the decision during a mid-ring 
television interview before leaving for Valley Hospital to have an injured left 
shoulder treated. 
</P>
<P>
 He also refused to use the injury, reportedly suffered in the second round, as 
an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give Moorer credit," Holyfield said. "He fought a rugged fight. His being 
left-handed, I couldn't get off the way I wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield was cut above the left eye in the fifth round and the wound was 
opened later despite the corner work of Don Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cut man, Ace Marotta, was fired by Holyfield recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "That (the change in the corner) didn't make any difference," Holyfield said. 
"There was blood in my eye, but a champion has to fight under any 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances, according to trainer Turner, were that Holyfield needed a 
big 12th round to retain his title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Evander to fight as hard as he could because he was behind," Turner 
said. "He went all out, but he just didn't have it. I thought that the decision 
was fair. Moorer fought a heck of a fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The new World Boxing Assn. and IBF champion agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people doubted me," he said. "I did what I had to. I beat the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Moorer needed some prodding in the corner from Atlas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was on my . . . from the first round to the 12th," Moorer said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the eighth, the trainer had a question for the fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wasn't going to win the fight, then I was," Atlas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if he wanted to change places with me. He said he didn't."

SAILING; BAD START SLOWS STARS & STRIPES

 A chagrined Dennis Conner and a woman on a sailboard were among about 400 
boats starting the 47th Newport-Ensenada International Yacht Race in light 
winds off Newport Beach on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two starting lines side by side to accommodate the large 
fleet.Conner, sailing the 60-foot Stars & Stripes catamaran that holds the race 
record of 9 hours 7 minutes, appeared to be off to a runaway start at the noon 
gun, but a few minutes later realized he had not started from the line assigned 
to the Ocean Racing Catamaran Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to restart 8 minutes 15 seconds late, but was still expected to be 
first to finish overall. Even so, he probably wouldn't have threatened his 
record. Instead of strong northwesterlies that had been forecast, the wind was 
only about 6 knots from the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanee Butler of Aliso Viejo, the U.S. women's sailboard representative in the 
1992 Olympics, was not an official entry but took a half-hour's head start 
toward Ensenada in a fund-raising effort for her '96 Olympic campaign. RICH

FIRST PENSION PETITIONS COURT FOR LIQUIDATION; BANKRUPTCY: THE IRVINE COMPANY'S 
FILING PUTS INVESTORS IN A PANIC, DESPITE ASSURANCES THAT THEIR FUNDS ARE SAFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A pension fund administrator filed a petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court Friday 
to liquidate itself, sending chills through investors who say they have put $40 
million to $70 million in the hands of its parent company. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension Corp., which sends checks from investment proceeds to individual 
investors, will remain open with a skeleton crew of a dozen workers while its 
owner tries to sell the assets, said William M. Burd, a Santa Ana bankruptcy 
lawyer for First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's money or investments are at risk," Burd said. "The intent is to get 
the bankruptcy trustee to provide administration and record-keeping for a brief 
time while we try to consummate a sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Panicked investors nevertheless flooded city police and federal authorities 
with dozens of calls Friday. In calls to the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission, the U.S. attorney's office, Irvine police and the FBI, they 
complained about missed payments and worried that their money would be 
squandered. 
</P>
<P>
 An investor who showed up at First Pension's headquarters told a guard he had 
millions of dollars tied up with the firm.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a company that had been in business a long time," said Ralph Breen, a 
Los Angeles resident who has been investing with its parent company, First 
Diversified Financial Services, since 1982. "It's not like they're a 
fly-by-night operation." 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension sent letters Thursday to investors to try to assure them that 
none of its creditors could touch their money. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, investors worried that the bankruptcy portends bigger problems at 
First Diversified in Irvine. The parent company mainly creates pools of money 
from investors to fund second trust deeds, which are risky mortgages because 
first trust deeds have priority should foreclosures occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors said First Diversified has often had problems repaying funds when 
the investments are supposed to mature. But the company has continued to pay 
interest and in some cases has eventually paid everything back, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Bradshaw, 64, a retired graphic designer and commercial artist, said 
the company is nearly two weeks late on a $6,000 payment to him. "I don't hold 
a great deal of hope that it's on its way," the Manhattan Beach resident said. 
"I may have to go back and look for a job." 
</P>
<P>
 He and others said Friday they want to know where the money is and why it is 
not being repaid. First Diversified newsletters, Bradshaw said, have trumpeted 
the fact that it has had as much as $70 million in mortgage securities, though 
that amount was down to $40 million last fall. The company also has offered 
such investments as leases of medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 William E. Cooper, chairman of First Pension and related companies, could not 
be reached for comment Friday. He also refused to talk with Irvine police, who 
went to First Pension's two-story white stucco office where some of the 40 
employees were removing their personal belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension's bankruptcy petition, filed late Friday, lists debts of nearly 
$6.4 million and assets of about $500,000, Burd said. The value of the client 
list and goodwill, he said, is estimated at $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest debt was $5 million in loans from the parent company. First 
Diversified will voluntarily subordinate its claim if a buyer can be found, the 
lawyer said.

NAVY TURNS TO CIVILIAN ATTORNEYS TO HANDLE ITS BIGGEST CASE; MILITARY: SERVICE 
SAYS THE MOVE IS NO REFLECTION ON JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAWYERS, BUT OTHERS AREN'T 
SO SURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rebuke to the Justice Department, the Navy is taking the extraordinary 
step of seeking up to $10 million of outside legal advice on the biggest civil 
suit in defense industry history. 
</P>
<P>
 The service has asked major Washington-area law firms to submit contract bids 
for legal work in the suit filed in 1991 by General Dynamics Corp. and 
McDonnell Douglas Corp., in which the two contractors charged that the Navy 
illegally canceled their contract to build the A-12 attack jet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy has declined to say how much it is preparing to pay for the legal 
work, but attorneys familiar with the service's formal request for bids 
estimate the outside attorneys will cost taxpayers $5 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials insist they are not dissatisfied with the Justice Department's 
work, but rather are concerned about the service's massive vulnerability in the 
case. The Navy said about $4 billion is at stake -- enough to buy a couple of 
aircraft carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside attorneys are not likely to do actual trial work, but rather issue a 
"second opinion" about whether the Navy should settle the case out of court. 
The Navy said it expects the opinion to require 40,000 hours of legal work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy felt the second opinion was necessary in this case due to the 
magnitude of the amount at issue and the significance of the case as a 
potential precedent," said Lt. Conrad Chun, a Navy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department attorney said the decision to hire an outside law firm 
was made by the Navy and referred questions to Navy officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Internal disputes between the Defense Department and Justice Department are 
fairly common, especially in areas where the Defense Department has a business 
interest," said Tim Hatch, a government practice attorney at Gibson, Dunn & 
Crutcher. "There must be some (unknown) agenda at work here." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), a member of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, said he intends to ask Navy officials what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have difficulty understanding why with all the legal money we spend on 
various departments and the Justice Department, we would be going outside to 
hire legal help," he said. "It is an inappropriate way to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Hordell, a Washington attorney, said the Navy request is unusual in 
cases where the government is the defendant, though he added that the entire 
A-12 case is unusually large and complex. "People go to doctors for second 
opinions all the time," Hordell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other attorneys familiar with the case, however, say the move reflects the 
Navy's realization that the government's defense is weak and that the Navy now 
must face some hard choices.  
</P>
<P>
 The decision to get an outside opinion is a bitter pill for the Justice 
Department. "Justice attorneys are very proud people," said one private lawyer 
who asked not to be identified. "There is a lot of ego at stake here." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Judge Robert Hodges Jr. has attempted to jawbone the parties into a 
settlement, but Navy officials have been reluctant to enter serious 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has come to resemble a small industry in itself. McDonnell Douglas 
and General Dynamics estimate their legal costs are running $30 million 
annually or $90 million so far. It is assumed the government's costs are about 
the same, meaning the suit has cost $180 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy, for example, has a litigation support company in suburban Virginia, 
which has an estimated 200 full time clerks working three shifts who do nothing 
but process paper work for the case around the clock.

AFTER THE QUAKE, BUSINESS STILL SHAKY; SALES OFF BY UP TO 80%, BUT WILL TO 
SURVIVE REMAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The three months since the Northridge earthquake have sorely tested the 
resources, creativity and optimism of merchants along a hard-hit block of 
Reseda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 They've dipped into savings and taken on debt to replace lost merchandise, 
haggled over leases and coped with a maze of bureaucratic demands. But each 
week has seen more and more shops open for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales are down 10% to 80%, and for many merchants, staying in business remains 
a day-to-day struggle. Still, a gritty determination to survive pervades the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Jackie Jones, owner of Jones Coffee Co. When she first viewed the 
quake devastation at her boutique -- half a block north of the Northridge 
Meadows apartments, where the temblor killed 16 people -- the only item left 
intact among the spilled coffee beans and shattered Victorian collectibles was 
a solitary plate. After 15 years, Jones thought she would never open her doors 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet open she did. Jones called vendors to replace her $50,000 in lost 
merchandise and worked out deals to defer payments. She tapped her savings 
while waiting for word on her Small Business Administration loan application. 
But Jones now sees just half as many customers as before the quake, and she's 
selling more tacky wax and earthquake-proof plate hangers than expensive china. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a breakable business," she said with a sigh. "It's going to take a 
while for people to buy breakables again." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants say they've lost business because former customers who lived in 
now-condemned apartments have left the area, while homeowners are too busy 
fixing their houses. Some shopkeepers saw a temporary jump in sales following 
the earthquake, which they attribute to sightseers who made the Northridge 
Meadows apartments a tourist stop. But those crowds have abated, and for many, 
business has slowed again. 
</P>
<P>
 Demolition of Northridge Meadows is scheduled for May 2, and business owners 
now worry that the tear-down process will prevent customers from getting to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses have called it quits. In the once-thriving Northridge Garden 
Center, where Jones has her shop, half the spaces are vacant. The former owner 
of the mini-mall also walked away last month, signing the deed over to the 
lender, who is just now starting to repair cracked walls and damaged floors and 
ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, Roya Saberzadeh, owner of Rochie's Greek Row, said sales are 
half the pre-quake level. Her clothing and memorabilia shop caters to Cal State 
Northridge sororities and fraternities, but enrollment is down and many campus 
facilities are closed. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $5,000 monthly overhead, Saberzadeh is losing money and wonders how 
she'll replace wrecked equipment. She got a 15% rent reduction but is disputing 
rent payments from just after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 She'd like to get an SBA loan and start a mail-order catalogue to lessen her 
dependence on CSUN. But her loan application hasn't been filed because she must 
re-create necessary tax documents that were lost in a fire that destroyed her 
family's Chatsworth house a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The house was being rebuilt, but it now has $50,000 in earthquake damage. 
Saberzadeh was told at a Federal Emergency Management Administration center 
that the family can't get a grant because it wasn't living in the house during 
the quake. The family continues to pay a $2,300 monthly mortgage, plus $800 
rent for two rooms where it now lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightmare," Saberzadeh said. "Every morning before I open my shop, I'm 
someplace. I'm in this line, that line, at this interview, that interview. I'm 
being gobbled up by paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
 Some shop owners are devising new ways to drum up sales. The Kids at Heart 
gift shop and Coco's restaurant, both in Northridge Garden Center, offered 
discounted food and merchandise one recent Saturday to customers in pajamas. 
With sales off 30%, Kids at Heart owner Laura D'Angelo said, "you can't just 
have a sale, you have to have an event." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are tightening their belts. At Kimary's Nail Boutique, where business 
is down 15%, owner Kim Dellibovi obtained a $10,000 bank loan, but she cut out 
such extras as silk plant hangings, premium hand soap, ceramic decor and free 
cookies, and replaced her "super-duper" phone with a basic model. Many 
customers have trickled back in. "Their nails were a mess," Dellibovi said.  
</P>
<P>
 But some find their hope running thin. Harry Paissides, co-owner of Reseda Hye 
Market, said 80% of his business disappeared when many of the Middle Eastern 
immigrants who frequented his specialty grocery were forced from nearby 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Sujatha Balasubramanian, owner of Paru's Indian restaurant, and Gianni Fontana 
di Trevi, who owns a dry-cleaning shop, used to rely on referrals and employees 
from Northridge Fashion Center for business. With that mall closed for several 
months, they wonder how long they can hang on. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlords also complain of trying times. Bill Matthews, who manages two strip 
malls on the block that are owned by his family, has completed repairs there 
and has been negotiating with tenants over rents. He said he's trying to 
restructure his debt with a mortgage banker whose attitude is, "If you can't 
enforce contracts with tenants, we will." 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge Garden Center, new owner Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co. 
in Hartford, Conn., won't charge tenants rent while structural repairs are 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
 But some shopkeepers decided not to wait. Helmut Behensky, owner of Bea's Swim 
& Sport, pictured an aftershock hitting while customers were trying on 
swimsuits, so he reopened his shop in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, like Jackie Jones, plan to stick it out. 
</P>
<P>
 On a wall by her shop entrance, she hung the plate that outlasted the quake as 
a symbol of endurance and a reminder that "I'm supposed to be here."

 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says reduced-fat peanut spreads 
developed by two major food companies cannot be called peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
 The makers have a choice: Change the formulas or call the products something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision affects Peter Pan Smart Choice, introduced in November by Hunt & 
Wesson, and Skippy Reduced-Fat, sold since January by CPC International. 
</P>
<P>
 Under FDA standards, peanut butter must contain 90% peanuts. In the low-fat 
versions, some of the peanuts are replaced by soy protein and other 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA admonished the companies that "consumers expect peanut butter products 
to be made from peanuts."

BOFA HIRES LEADING DERIVATIVES EXECUTIVE TO GUIDE ITS OPERATION; INVESTMENTS: 
JOSEPH BAUMAN, WHO HEADED CITIBANK'S GLOBAL GROUP, WILL LEAD THE BANK'S VENTURE 
IN THE EMBATTLED FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The derivatives market has gotten such fearsome publicity in the last few 
months that many institutions say they are shunning it like the plague. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bank of America is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's second-largest bank announced Friday that it has hired one of the 
nation's leading derivatives executives to run its own operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph P. Bauman, 44, head of business development at Citibank's global 
derivatives group, will become head of BofA's U.S. Financial Engineering and 
Risk Management Group and director of its global counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bauman, BofA will be getting a strong defender of the embattled business. 
He is chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Assn., the industry's 
lobbying arm. In an interview while still at Citibank, Bauman recently argued 
that derivatives are an indispensable part of a commercial bank's business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derivatives have brought back some of the traditional role banks have 
performed as a financial intermediary," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based on the value of an 
underlying security, commodity or index, as stock options are based on the 
value of the underlying stock. In recent years, the derivatives market has 
spread from regulated commodities exchanges to a wide range of transactions 
fashioned by banks and investment companies to help corporate clients hedge 
risks. As hedging needs -- and technology -- have become more advanced, the 
nature of the instruments has become more complex.  
</P>
<P>
 Within the last few weeks, several derivatives users -- including Procter & 
Gamble, Gibson Greeting Cards and Mead -- have reported multimillion-dollar 
losses, the result of their hedging contracts failing to behave as expected and 
going spectacularly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to cries from Capitol Hill for better regulation of the market, if 
not an outright ban of the devices. Among the key issues raised by lawmakers 
and regulators is whether banks have overly exposed themselves to large losses 
if their customers default or the deals otherwise go sour. 
</P>
<P>
 BofA long has been an important player in derivatives, ranking among the top 
15 U.S. commercial banks in the contractual value of its transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 By that measure, the value of derivatives contracts on the bank's books was 
about $922 billion as of Dec. 31, up from $782 billion the previous year. The 
actual amount at risk from default of its partners in the transactions -- a key 
measure of a bank's exposure to reversals in the market -- dropped to $13.71 
billion from $18.1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 For both years, about half the contractual figures was in foreign exchange 
contracts; BofA has traders stationed in dozens of countries around the world. 
The bank both executes transactions for clients and invests in derivatives to 
manage its own risks, executives say. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new domestic post, Bauman replaces George Handjinicolaou, who recently 
left BofA to join the International Finance Co. of the World Bank. The global 
post is a new one. The aim of Bauman's appointment is "to further our global 
objectives in this key business area," said Gerald Doherty, director of the 
bank's Global Capital Markets Group.

TRUCKING STRIKE GOES TO FEDERAL MEDIATORS; LABOR: TEAMSTERS AND FREIGHT 
COMPANIES ACQUIESCE TO THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, WHICH FEARS THE 2 1/2-WEEK 
STRIKE WILL DAMAGE THE ECONOMY. 
</P>

<P>
 After failing to resolve a 2 1/2-week trucking strike on their own, the 
Teamsters union and freight-hauling companies Friday agreed to submit to 
federal mediation, as government officials expressed concern about the 
walkout's potential economic damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowing to requests by the Clinton Administration, the International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters and Trucking Management Inc., which represents the 20 
firms still closed by the walkout, are scheduled to meet today with the Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70,000 Teamsters will remain on the picket lines until a tentative 
agreement is reached in the dispute over management proposals to hire more 
part-time workers at truck terminals, haul more shipments by rail and use 
binding arbitration to handle contract disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides had resumed negotiations Monday, and the carriers said they had 
withdrawn their proposal on part-time workers, but the talks proved fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
 The "lack of significant progress is troubling to us," Labor Secretary Robert 
Reich and Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said in a letter sent Friday 
to Teamsters President Ron Carey and Arthur H. Bunte Jr., president of Trucking 
Management Inc. "Our purpose is to encourage the parties to find that common 
ground which will lead to an immediate settlement of this dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 Pena and Reich said the strike had begun to "affect thousands of shippers and 
the normal flow of goods by truck and sea" and that "spot reports indicate 
nascent problems in parts availability for automobile assembly." 
</P>
<P>
 John Calhoun Wells, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation 
Service, said in a statement that the strike "places a strain on our recovery 
and the welfare of our citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 However, though shipments have been delayed and non-union trucking companies 
have been overwhelmed with orders, the strike has so far caused no significant 
shortages or disruptions to commerce. The firms involved in the strike ship 
mainly consumer products and manufacturing parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta-based Home Depot, for example, with 275 stores nationwide, was 
initially concerned about the prospect of shortages in power tools and some 
plumbing accessories. But the company has adjusted by arranging for trucking 
companies that normally deliver only to Home Depot's regional distribution 
centers to deliver products to some of the stores as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some stores are short of an item or two," said Peter Cleaveland, Home Depot's 
vice president of distribution. "But we're in better shape than we expected." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the strike has proven costly to the struck trucking companies and the 
Teamsters. Two of the largest firms, Yellow Freight and Roadway Express, said 
the walkout is costing them $10 million a day each. Palo Alto-based CF 
MotorFreight has cut the wages of non-union employees by up to 25% and placed 
some workers on leave as the walkout continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the union is spending about $14 million a week on strike benefits 
for its members. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 members from Teamsters Local 63 on Friday morning occupied the lobby 
of a Bank of America branch in downtown San Bernardino for about two hours, 
police said. The union said it was protesting the bank's role as a lender to CF 
MotorFreight's parent.

PUC DEREGULATION PROPOSAL DRAWS CRITICS LEFT AND RIGHT; ENERGY: CONSUMER 
ADVOCATES AND FINANCIAL ANALYSTS VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT AN OPEN ELECTRICITY 
MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea driving deregulation of the state's electric utilities is lower power 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But a surprising range of critics, from consumer advocates to financial 
analysts, question where the savings would come from under the plan proposed 
this week by the state Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say market forces will inevitably bring rates down -- a development 
they see auspicious signs of in other deregulated industries. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the PUC wants to change its rate-setting procedure to a method 
favored by the utilities -- "performance-based ratemaking" -- in part because 
it allows them the chance to profit from efficiency gains. 
</P>
<P>
 But "only when utilities get enhanced profits are they obliged to give some of 
that back," says Michel P. Florio, senior attorney with Toward Utility Rate 
Normalization, a San Francisco-based consumer group. "What performance-based 
ratemaking means is that your rates keep going up, just a little more slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the plan also calls for all ratepayers to pay a transitional fee to 
cover so-called stranded utility investments -- such as expensive nuclear 
plants -- that may not be competitive amid retail competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "How is the commission going to maintain the financial integrity of the 
utilities, to not have losses from stranded investment, and still reduce 
rates?" asks Mark D. Luftig, an electric utilities analyst at Kemper Securities 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 After the PUC's announcement, Kemper weakened its rating for SCEcorp, parent 
of Southern California Edison Co., from "average risk" to "high risk." 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have SCE as a long-term buy," Luftig says, " . . . but I'm not going 
to bang the table anymore until I see what the (PUC's detailed) plans are." 
</P>
<P>
 Stock traders apparently share some of his concerns. On the New York Stock 
Exchange, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. shares plunged $1.75 on Friday to $27.50, 
while SCEcorp tumbled 62.5 cents to $15.625 and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
lost $1 to $22. SCEcorp shares are now at their lowest level in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, retail electric competition has been tried only in England and 
Wales, which unleashed competition for large industrial users in March, 1991. 
That step came in tandem with privatization of the once-national industry, 
making meaningful lessons for California's experiment hard to extract. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, British rates have dropped 30% to 35% for small businesses while rising 
for large industry, though much of that has stemmed from the loss of government 
subsidies. Rates have remained level for residential consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks as if what should happen in theory is, in fact, happening," says 
Lynn Scarlett, vice president of research at the Reason Foundation, a 
market-oriented think tank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarlett and others also cite parallel experiences in the deregulation of 
telephone service. Deregulation of long-distance calling has brought a 
substantial drop in rates. And rate declines in a New Zealand experiment with 
local phone deregulation -- which better mirrors the complexities of electric 
deregulation -- also offer cause for optimism, Scarlett says. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone companies have also had experience with the other side of the PUC plan: 
a switch to rate setting that rewards utilities for their efficiency gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell, notes PUC Commissioner P. Gregory Conlon, operates under rules 
similar to those that would govern the electric utilities. Its rates have 
steadily dropped -- by 1.5% in 1993 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that benefit will flow through to residential customers before 2002," 
Conlon adds, the year residential power users would get to choose their 
electric supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC envisions a market developing in 1996 -- when industrial customers get 
to choose their supplier -- that will lower the price of power even for 
still-regulated consumers, because their utilities will be buying on that 
market too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like in any competitive market," says John A. Anderson, executive 
director of the Electric Consumer Resource Council, a big-industry group that 
supports the PUC plan. "Everybody doesn't have to shop to benefit."

NAVY TURNS TO CIVILIANS TO HANDLE BIGGEST SUIT IN DEFENSE HISTORY; MILITARY: 
SERVICE SAYS THE MOVE IS NO REFLECTION ON JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAWYERS, BUT 
OTHERS AREN'T SO SURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rebuke to the Justice Department, the Navy is taking the extraordinary 
step of seeking up to $10 million of outside legal advice on the biggest civil 
suit in defense industry history. 
</P>
<P>
 The service has asked major Washington-area law firms to submit contract bids 
for legal work in the suit filed in 1991 by General Dynamics Corp. and 
McDonnell Douglas Corp., in which the two contractors charged that the Navy 
illegally canceled their contract to build the A-12 attack jet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy has declined to say how much it is preparing to pay for the legal 
work, but attorneys familiar with the service's formal request for bids 
estimate the outside attorneys will cost taxpayers $5 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials insist they are not dissatisfied with the Justice Department's 
work, but rather are concerned about the service's massive vulnerability in the 
case. The Navy said about $4 billion is at stake -- enough to buy a couple of 
aircraft carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside attorneys are not likely to do actual trial work, but rather issue a 
"second opinion" about whether the Navy should settle the case out of court. 
The Navy said it expects the opinion to require 40,000 hours of legal work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy felt the second opinion was necessary in this case due to the 
magnitude of the amount at issue and the significance of the case as a 
potential precedent," said Lt. Conrad Chun, a Navy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department attorney said the decision to hire an outside law firm 
was made by the Navy and referred questions to Navy officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Internal disputes between the Defense Department and Justice Department are 
fairly common, especially in areas where the Defense Department has a business 
interest," said Tim Hatch, a government practice attorney at Gibson, Dunn & 
Crutcher. "There must be some (unknown) agenda at work here." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), a member of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, said he intends to ask Navy officials what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have difficulty understanding why with all the legal money we spend on 
various departments and the Justice Department, we would be going outside to 
hire legal help," he said. "It is an inappropriate way to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Hordell, a Washington attorney, said the Navy request is unusual in 
cases where the government is the defendant, though he added that the entire 
A-12 case is unusually large and complex. "People go to doctors for second 
opinions all the time," Hordell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other attorneys familiar with the case, however, say the move reflects the 
Navy's realization that the government's defense is weak and that the Navy now 
must face some hard choices.  
</P>
<P>
 The decision to get an outside opinion is a bitter pill for the Justice 
Department. "Justice attorneys are very proud people," said one private lawyer 
who asked not to be identified. "There is a lot of ego at stake here."

DUPONT SETTLES 220 FUNGICIDE LAWSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILMINGTON, Del. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DuPont Co. said Friday it will pay $214 million to settle close to half the 
560 suits against it relating to a controversial fungicide that farmers say 
ruined crops and led to sexual dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement of 220 of the suits is the latest effort by the chemical giant 
to put behind it the long-simmering dispute over farmers' claims against 
Benlate DF 50.  
</P>
<P>
 With Friday's settlement, DuPont will have paid out about $714 million to 
farmers with Benlate complaints, and insurance deductibles and other charges 
bring its costs to nearly $1 billion, according to an analyst's figures. 
</P>
<P>
 DuPont said the settlement is covered by previous charges to earnings, which 
total $476 million after taxes.

STOCKS MIXED AS WALL ST. THRILL RIDE SLOWS 
</P>

<P>
 Stocks ended mixed Friday as the bond market's midweek rally ran out of steam. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials eased 3.86 points to 3,648.68. For the week, the Dow 
lost 12.79 points, after a roller-coaster ride that saw prices plunge early in 
the week, then rocket on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond closed at 7.22% 
on Friday, up from 7.21% on Thursday, as oil prices jumped. Still, the yield 
was down from 7.28% a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time in the last couple of weeks we're closing on more of a 
positive note," said Nick Kinas, bond trader at Bank Leumi Trust in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The belief that interest rates may have stopped rising -- at least temporarily 
-- had helped pull rate-sensitive stocks up early in the week. That buying 
spilled into industrial issues Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, profit takers clipped some of the financial issues, but overall 
winners topped losers by 13 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 14 to 12 
on Nasdaq. Volume slowed, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks advanced 3.82 points to 
722.56, building on Thursday's 13.22-point rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said they were encouraged by the relative lack of active profit 
taking in stocks after Thursday's 54-point Dow gain. That suggested investors 
see the market bottoming here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy stocks were the day's big winners, as June crude oil futures surged 
51 cents to $17.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the first 
close above $17 since November. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil got a push from civil disturbances in Nigeria, the world's 10th-largest 
oil producer. Shell's Nigerian arm said it expected three-day delays in getting 
shipments of high-quality crude out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Among energy issues, Mobil leaped 2 1/4 to 78 3/8 and Exxon added 5/8 to 63 
1/8. Both reported strong quarterly earnings. Other winners included Unocal, up 
1/2 to 27; Arco, up 1 to 98 1/8; Louisiana Land, up 1 3/8 to 40, and Amoco, up 
7/8 to 55 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some tech issues continued to rebound. Texas Instruments rose 1 5/8 to 73 
1/8, Creative Technologies jumped 3 3/8 to 24 3/8, Powersoft gained 3 1/8 to 33 
1/8 and Sybase added 1 to 48 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM, which surged 6 1/8 on Thursday on word of surprisingly good earnings, 
added 3/8 to 58 3/4 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Unisys plunged 2 1/2 to 11 1/2 on disappointing earnings. Another tech 
loser on lower-than-expected earnings was Zebra Technologies, which plunged 6 
7/8 to 26 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also on the downside, weaker financial stocks included Chase Manhattan, off 
1 to 33 3/4; Federal National Mortgage, down 2 to 82, and BankAmerica, down 1 
3/4 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
 * Casino giant Promus, which owns Harrah's casinos, sank 1 5/8 to 32. The 
Louisiana attorney general said the firm must rebid for its New Orleans gaming 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, Mexico City's Bolsa stock index recorded its biggest 
advance in more than three years after the Mexican central bank moved 
decisively to protect the weakening peso. That increased investor confidence, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa rocketed 133.99 points, or 6.5%, to 2,209.31. It had gained 118 
points Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Telmex shares traded on the NYSE shot up 2 5/8 to 57 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX index gained 16.95 points to 2,213.92, while Tokyo's 
Nikkei index rose 165.03 points to 19,964.39. In London, the FTSE-100 index 
shot up 32.5 points to 3,133.7. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, gold futures closed lower in New York. The April futures contract 
on the Comex lost $2.50 to $370.60.

INDEXES MIXED AS INVESTORS' MOODS EDDY

<P>
 Stocks ended Friday's session narrowly mixed as bond yields gyrated, muddying 
the outlook for interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In a market full of cross-currents, investors bought the issues of 
economically sensitive companies, which had been battered earlier in the week. 
But they took profits in those sectors that had outperformed the rest of the 
market, such as consumer stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil stocks rose along with crude oil prices, but utility and banking stocks 
fell as interest rates crept up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.86 points to 3,648.68, losing 12.79 
for the week. But in the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners 
by about 11 to 8 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 295.78 
million shares, down from 378.77 million the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, broad-market indexes were mixed. The NYSE's composite index 
fell 0.23 to 247.95, while the S&P 500 index lost 1.10 to 447.63. The Nasdaq 
composite index of mostly smaller issues rose 3.52 to 722.56. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term interest rates finished slightly higher, with the benchmark 30-year 
bond closing at 7.22%, about even with its level Thursday. But the fixed-income 
market swung narrowly throughout the day, pulling stock prices along with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the market was taking a breather after Thursday's dramatic 
53.83-point rise in the Dow, when stocks soared as bonds rose sharply and good 
earnings from IBM pushed technology issues higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Oil stocks rose amid a rise in the oil market. The June contract on crude oil 
rose 51 cents per barrel to $17.14 on the New York Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Atlantic Richfield rose 1 to 98 1/8; Texaco jumped 1 1/8 to 65. Mobil rose 2 
1/4 to 78 3/8 after it reported surprisingly strong first-quarter profit. 
Exxon, up 5/8 to 63 1/8, also reported good earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Utilities fell amid interest rate worries, pushing the Dow Jones utility 
average down 1.91 to 199.25. Pacific Gas & Electric lost 1 3/4 to 27 1/2. 
PaineWebber downgraded the utility stock to "unattractive" from "neutral." 
</P>
<P>
 * Banking stocks also fell. Chase Manhattan lost 1 to 33 3/4, Bank of New York 
fell 1 to 53 7/8 and BankAmerica fell 1 3/4 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico, which led the volume on the New York Stock Exchange, 
rose 2 5/8 to 57 1/2. The stock has been recovering from steep losses earlier 
in the week tied to political uncertainty in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM was second in volume and gained 3/8 to 58 3/4, extending a 6 1/8-point 
gain Thursday after releasing good first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Promus was third in volume and was down 1 5/8 at 32 after a long-delayed 
opening. The Louisiana attorney general required the gaming concern to rebid 
for its New Orleans gaming license. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unisys was fourth and down 2 1/2 at 11 1/2. The company posted sharply lower 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amgen was up 4 3/4 at 42. On Thursday, Amgen reported surprisingly strong 
first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets were closed higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index recorded its biggest advance in more than three years 
after the Mexican central bank moved decisively to protect the weakening peso. 
The Bolsa rocketed 133.99 points, or 6.46%, to 2,209.31. Germany's 30-share DAX 
average ended up 16.95 points at 2,213.92, while Tokyo's key Nikkei average 
closed up 165.03 points at 19,964.39. In London, the Financial Times 100-share 
average closed 32.5 points higher at 3,133.7, which was down 35.1 from last 
Friday.

 HUD to Propose Banking Reforms: The Department of Housing and Urban 
Development is expected to release a report Monday calling for broad reforms of 
the $177-billion Federal Home Loan Bank System, officials said.The system 
provides loans to thrifts and savings banks in much the same way the Federal 
Reserve System aids commercial banks. The HUD report will mark the Clinton 
Administration's first official statement about what role it wants the system's 
lenders to play in housing finance. It is expected to call for changes that 
would increase lending to low-income borrowers and developers of low-cost 
housing.

FORMER PAINEWEBBER MANAGER DISCIPLINED; SECURITIES: HEAD OF BEVERLY HILLS 
OFFICE SHOULD HAVE PREVENTED THEFT OF FUNDS, SEC ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ruling that the former manager of PaineWebber Inc.'s Beverly Hills office 
should have prevented the theft of customer funds, a Securities and Exchange 
Commission administrative law judge ordered her suspended for six months from 
acting as a brokerage supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia A. Johnson, 43, had been in charge of the office from 1984 until 
mid-1991.In 1987 and 1988, one of her brokers wrote and deposited unauthorized 
checks, misappropriating $114,500 from the brokerage accounts of three clients, 
Administrative Law Judge Glenn R. Lawrence said in an April 12 decision that 
was made public this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge wrote that Johnson had failed to respond to numerous "red flags" 
about the broker's activity, including an internal audit that turned up 
suspicious checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had she heeded the red flags and asserted proper supervisory controls, she 
would have prevented most if not all of the misappropriations," the judge 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Johnson denied any wrongdoing, strongly disputed the judge's 
findings and said she will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The broker, David Zetterstrom, ultimately was fired by Johnson and shortly 
afterward committed suicide.

 Johnson said the judge's decision is unfair because it comes seven years after 
the incidents occurred. Since then, she said, documents have been lost and 
"people have had memory lapses." 
</P>
<P>
 She added, "I have a clean record, and I take a lot of pride in what I do for 
my clients." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson currently works as a broker in Smith Barney's Beverly Hills office. 
Arthur W. Hahn, her attorney, said that since she is not a supervisor there, 
the decision will not affect her work at Smith Barney; a lawyer for the firm 
agreed. 
</P>

 In 1993, the SEC imposed an unusually stiff punishment on the PaineWebber 
Beverly Hills office, banning it from opening new accounts for one month.

U.S. TO RESTRICT GRAIN IMPORTS FROM CANADA; COMMERCE: AMERICA'S LARGEST TRADING 
PARTNER DENIES CHARGES OF DUMPING, THREATENS TARIFFS.

<P>
 The world's two largest trading partners edged closer to a trade war over 
wheat Friday after the United States said it will restrict imports of Canadian 
wheat, flour and barley beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada criticized the United States for not playing the free-trade game fairly 
and threatened to slap tariffs on U.S. chicken, wine, bourbon, pasta, canned 
fruits and bakery goods. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said tonnage limits will be negotiated 
over the next 90 days, with a goal of limiting Canadian shipments to levels far 
lower than they are today. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy accused Canada and its Wheat Board of dumping grain at unfairly low 
prices in the U.S. market. The United States contends Canada uses "predatory 
pricing," unfairly subsidizes its wheat and hurts U.S. farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel aggrieved because of the inordinate amount of wheat that is coming in 
from Canada," Espy said. "We believe this (dumping) is the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian officials denied that Canada is dumping subsidized grain and said 
rising exports are the result of freer trade between the nations and higher 
U.S. prices caused by last year's Midwest floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very unhappy. We don't intend to cave in, and we have not agreed with 
the American negotiations," Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps told Parliament 
in Ottawa. "We intend to take action."

 GM to Recall 46,000 Cars, Trucks: The auto maker said it is recalling 12,000 
of its 1994-model Cadillac, Buick and Chevrolet cars and 34,000 of its 
1994-model C/K full-size pickups.General Motors Corp. said the Cadillac 
Fleetwood, Buick Roadmaster and Chevrolet Caprice models may have misrouted 
engine oil cooler lines, which could lead to an engine fire. On the C/K 
pickups, it said, a nut was not being properly tightened, which could result in 
loss of control of the vehicle. The company said there have been no reports of 
incidents related to either condition.

ART REVIEW; A SHOW BEYOND PICTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Upstairs at the California Museum of Photography, projected on the curving 
rear walls outside a little auditorium, computer-generated video imagery by 
artist Jennifer Steinkamp and recorded sound by composer James Johnson together 
transform the space into a weird and witty spectacle. Colorful images pulse, 
electronic sound seems to breathe and solid walls appear to dissolve, as if 
allowing a temporary, Superman-like glimpse inside their hidden innards. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a flat, chunky grid-pattern that starts to boil, then thins out into a 
tangled web of wires floating through deep space. (It looks like a snarled 
freeway map for the information superhighway.) Then, reverse the sequence; the 
inner glimpse reverts to a jaunty surface decoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Flat-out hypnotic, the latent, Barnum-esque trickery of modern photographic 
imagery is wryly pumped up. Steinkamp's and Johnson's eccentrically engaging 
collaboration is part sci-fi seduction, part meditation on electronic phantoms. 
It also inquires into our habit of dividing the world into binaries, such as 
body and soul. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece is among the more compelling of nine installations in "Photography 
and the Photographic: Theories, Practices and Histories," a profitable 
exhibition of work commissioned from 12 artists in Southern California. The 
show was organized by Amelia Jones, guest curator and UC Riverside art history 
professor, as an adjunct to an international symposium of the same name, held 
at the school two weekends ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The show covers a wide territory of artistic formats -- with one notable 
exception: Single photographs, independently hung on the wall, are absent. 
"Photography and the Photographic" is cheerfully biased in favor of anything 
but traditional camera pictures; apparently, it means to avoid any sense of 
photography as an independent discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, artists were invited to make new works addressing current 
photographic issues. The risk in that procedure, encountered in Daniel J. 
Martinez's bright, white room filled with video monitors and projectors, is in 
coming too close to simple illustration of familiar theory. The influential 
critique of modern institutional surveillance and social control found in 
Michel Foucault's incisive book "Discipline and Punish" is the obvious source 
for Martinez's installation, which doesn't add much to Foucault's text. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Jorge Daniel Veneciano's "On the Trail of the Immigrant by the 
Signposts of History" starts with the commonplace that camera images inherently 
lie, and opens it up to resonant use. Veneciano pairs written texts about 
immigration, often conflicting in viewpoint and from different eras, with 
black-and-white images shot in the manner of documentary photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Independently, the pictures seem to record such things as day laborers looking 
for work; together, they reveal that they are not what they seem. A man wearing 
a T-shirt celebrating the 150th anniversary of photography (a self-portrait of 
the artist?) turns up casually posed in one picture after another. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly the comparative texts and pictures explode into a dizzying array of 
blind assertions, false assumptions, likely miscommunications and more. Given 
the politically charged subject, the resulting fireworks effortlessly cross 
conventional boundaries of thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Barton Miller's "Curiosity, Amusement and Terror" hinges on the 
historical expansion of European and American colonialism and the 
contemporaneous popularity of camera images. Using an enclosing row of vintage 
stereoscopic pictures taken in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Indian 
subcontinent (they're part of the museum's collection), he frames an enclosed 
room, or camera . 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the room, a phantom image of human ears seems to come into focus in a 
developing bath, while tiny portrait photographs suspended overhead flutter in 
the breeze of a tropical fan. The titular "curiosity, amusement and terror," 
borrowed from a notation scrawled on the back of one stereoscopic picture, is 
subtly evoked inside the camera in which you stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Miller, Nancy Buchanan uses the photographic process itself as a resonant 
structural metaphor. The steps a photographer uses to develop pictures provide 
the clever scaffolding for an engaging, interactive computer program about real 
estate, especially in Riverside. Photo development meets real estate 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive computer programs can give a false impression that the user is 
freely moving around through boundless cyber space, gathering up pure 
information, when in fact the options are constrained by the program's limits. 
Frankly using photographic structure, which requires selecting fragmentary 
points of view, Buchanan neatly avoids this trap. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Howe, Jody Zellen and the team of Nancy Barton and Michael Cohen offer 
more conventional installations. They incorporate different kinds of 
photographic reproduction to refer to role models, to the spooky chaos of 
information overload and to the ghosts of memory. Howe constructs a barren 
family tree of fallen blueprint-images of women (from Emma Goldman to Barbie), 
Zellen a chamber-within-a-chamber occluded with vaguely threatening media 
images, Barton and Cohen a rumination on childhood trauma and loss. 
</P>
<P>
 (The ninth work, a collaboration between Robert Millar and Mark Zolun that, 
like Martinez's work, is located on the nearby UC Riverside campus, was not 
completely installed on the day I visited.) 
</P>
<P>
 Restricting the show to photographic installation art is a well-taken 
rhetorical gesture against considering photography as an independent medium 
with a discrete history -- although, by now, that's a rather established view. 
Given the prominence of installation art of all kinds today, an inescapable 
shadow of institutional fashion is cast. 
</P>
<P>
 There are photographers who don't do installations but whose work would be at 
home here. To see some within the otherwise engaging company of Steinkamp and 
Johnson, Buchanan, Miller and Veneciano would have been illuminating. 
</P>

REWRITES AND REHEARSALS: A TYPICAL 'BLOSSOM' DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayim Bialik laughs at the sound of testosterone pouring in through the window 
of her office at the Sunset-Gower studios. In the parking lot below, football 
legend and "Blossom" guest-star Terry Bradshaw is airing out a football with a 
series of Hail Mary passes, which the show's cast and crew members are mainly 
dropping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jenna (von Oy) and I are the only two females in the cast, and the guys are 
always reciting stupid lines from obscure movies and talking about sports," she 
explains. "It's not too socially exciting. They play football every chance they 
get." 
</P>
<P>
 Bialik's next sentence is interrupted by an anguished grunt from outside her 
window, prompting her to laugh again. "They get violent out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Largely outside the glare of the entertainment media, which finds itself more 
fascinated with the more prurient, less wholesome television, "Blossom" has 
watched its popularity quietly, steadily increase over the past four seasons. 
It ranks in the Top 40 this year, and is one of the most popular shows among 
teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen-year-old Bialik, who before "Blossom" was best known only for a brief 
but scene-stealing role in the tear-jerker "Beaches," has, thanks to her quick 
wit and her character's funky wardrobe, become an unlikely success story. A 
recent TV Guide story reported that she's the second-most-popular actress among 
teen-age girls, behind only Julia Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the show improved in the ratings this season, it weathered many 
behind-the-scenes tragedies (including the death of director Bill Bixby) and 
the loss of several writers to "The John Larroquette Show" (both series were 
created by Don Reo), and, like many programs, lost valuable time to the 
earthquake. In this, the last week of production, the cast and crew must tape 
not only the season finale, but a couple of scenes from another episode and 
introductions to a retrospective program composed of old clips. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the time crunch -- Bialik has to leave town the following week to 
appear in Woody Allen's TV movie, "Don't Drink the Water" -- she maintains an 
even, sunny disposition, and a precociously bemused outlook toward the quixotic 
nature of network TV production. 
</P>
<P>
 In the episode at hand, Joey (Joey Lawrence) and Vinnie (David Lascher), 
Blossom's brother and boyfriend, respectively, graduate from high school; 
Vinnie announces his intentions to attend Princeton. This, of course, portends 
big changes in the series next season concerning Blossom's love life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the writers wanted Blossom single for her senior year," Bialik says. 
"Being single is a totally different way of looking at your life, especially in 
high school." 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike previous seasons, "Blossom" this year won't end with a cliffhanger. 
"We usually have cliffhangers, which I think is kind of fun, but I guess this 
year there was nothing to hang," she says with a laugh. "I'm kind of surprised 
they didn't end on, 'We can't get engaged,' and pick that up next year. But I'm 
not a writer, so what do I know?" 
</P>
<P>
 Though she has graduated from high school and no longer needs the services of 
studio-appointed tutors, Bialik still comes in most mornings at 8 to study 
calculus. (She's still trying to decide whether to attend Harvard, where she 
has been accepted.) At 10 a.m., the cast rehearses until lunch, when Bialik 
meets again with a tutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Each script undergoes major rewrites through the week. "We come in on Monday 
and read the script, and get rewrites all day," Bialik says. "If there's going 
to be a lot of rewrites, they send us home and we get a script at night. 
Tuesday, we'll do a run-through for producers, and get rewrites after that. 
Wednesday, we get a brand-new script with rewrites, but they don't want to run 
out of colors for pages (differently colored pages indicate on which draft of a 
script a particular rewrite came in), so Wednesday we get a white script." 
Bialik laughs at the idea of the reams of paper expended on the script -- and 
only half-way through the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get (rewritten) pages Wednesday night, we get pages Thursday night, and 
sometimes we even get pages in the middle of the day Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there are two scenes to rehearse before the general run-through. "One 
is a huge family scene, the scenes that we dread, where they put every cast 
member and a couple of guest stars in one little room," Bialik says. "Sometimes 
the writers don't think about specific actors, they just think about the scene 
in general. So what you'll have are these nine-page scenes, which are brutal 
for us, and one character will have one joke on the first page and then five 
pages will go by where they don't have anything to say. So we end up saying, 
'OK, since I don't have any lines, I'm going to exit the room for a drink and 
I'll be back for my joke.' Bernard Hughes (who plays Blossom's grandfather) has 
literally one line, 'This calls for a drink,' and he leaves the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Things go pretty much as Bialik predicts, with the performers -- daisy-fresh 
after their romp in the parking lot -- struggling to find some way to pass the 
time while they're off-camera. Director Peter Baldwin tries to find some bits 
of business for each of the performers, handing Bialik a party prop. "I'll have 
something to do now -- I'll hold cheese," Bialik says wryly, to no one in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other scene is a redo," Bialik explains. "When we got changes last night 
-- the script was really long, so they made all these cuts. But this is the 
last scene of the show, where Blossom and Vinnie decide to sever the 
relationship. So they made all these cuts, and the breakup goes like this: I 
say, 'Are you thinking what I'm thinking?' He says, 'What?' and I say, 'We 
can't get engaged.' And that was basically the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 She laughs at such minimalism, as well as such an anti-climactic climax. "So 
we talked to the director, we talked to the producer, and said, 'You've got to 
put in some more lines.' So we got rewrites in the middle of the day, which is 
kind of rare when they've already made cuts. Hopefully, there'll be a little 
more explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is indeed expanded, with Blossom and Vinnie co-opting lines from 
"Casablanca" for their farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 Speeding things along for the production is the fact that in recent months, 
the program has not been taped before a live audience. "We've been doing shows 
in bits and pieces, which wouldn't make sense to the audience anyway," Bialik 
explains. "The audience doesn't really help us if they don't understand the 
sequence of the plot. Since their purpose is to come in and laugh, if they 
don't understand a reference, then they won't laugh and it'll just be 
uncomfortable for the actors. Right now, the audience is better off just 
watching the whole thing at home with a beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Which means, Bialik sheepishly admits, the producers are using a laugh track. 
"They do, and it's always too loud and too long. I was outside the room (where 
the laugh track is added), and every once in a while, I heard, (mimicking 
maniacal laughter), 'Ah, hahahahaha!"' 
</P>
<P>
 After taping is over, though, Bialik says she doesn't pay much attention to 
the final product -- and not just because of the cheesy laugh track. "It's hard 
for me to watch the show, because I remember cuts and shots and stuff, so it 
bothers me when someone is cut in the middle of a line, and it's a bad cut," 
she says. She has the episodes on video, however: "I'd love my grandkids to see 
what I did when I was young." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe by then she can muster up the wherewithal to watch the show. Right now, 
though, she says, "I think I sound funny, and I think I look funny." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Blossom" airs tonight at 8 on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39), then moves to 
Mondays at 8:30 p.m. on May 2. The season finale is scheduled for May 23.

THEATER REVIEW; 'ANATOMY' OF A MONOLOGUIST; SPALDING GRAY, WHO WILL BRING TO 
THE IRVINE BARCLAY TALES OF HIS PILGRIMAGES, MAKES HIS FEAR ACCESSIBLE AND 
FUNNY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Spalding Gray's a sick man. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky us. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Gray's Anatomy," his funniest and most profound monologue since "Swimming 
to Cambodia," the middle-aged crazies take possession of America's first 
neurotic and No. 1 storyteller. Gray performed it Wednesday at UCLA's Wadsworth 
Theater and brings it May 1 to the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 This self-described WASP Woody Allen has hit 50, and his body is slipping into 
"the Bermuda Triangle of Health." Gray's first sign of physical decay is a 
"macula pucker" -- a growth on the retina of his left eye -- and his search for 
a miraculous cure sends Gray on increasingly bizarre pilgrimages, from New 
Jersey's New Age nutritionists to the Philippines' psychic surgeons. His trips 
become a howl of high anxiety and hilarity. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're trips without slides, maps or props. This tour guide's exquisitely 
refined actor's voice takes us there. Wearing a plaid flannel shirt and jeans, 
Gray meanders onto the stage and sits at a simple table. His only props are a 
notebook and a glass of water. He cozily leans into a microphone, like a friend 
in a bar about to confess a secret. We can barely hear his first words: "I 
think it all began when. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Thank the entertainment gods that Gray wasn't diagnosed with Alzheimer's: 
Gray's minimalist stage art depends on remembrances of things past. He's a 
Proustian camera, and his memory works as film. He calls this technique "poetic 
journalism," a mixture of autobiography and sociology and comic improvisations, 
but his 14th monologue is a creative breakthrough from previous stories. It 
goes beyond the eccentric confines of "Monster in a Box," which explored 
writer's block, or the Hollywood-insider observations of "Swimming to 
Cambodia." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gray's Anatomy" is about the Big Fear: death. How do we live with it? Do we 
fight it? Do we accept it? Is there a faith that a cynic like Gray can embrace? 
For the first time, Gray's obsessions aren't a freak show. We share his 
anatomy, so we identify with his sadness. "Gray's Anatomy" is his most 
accessible and his most romantic. It's also the first one with a truly happy 
ending. 
</P>
<P>
 But that ending isn't a Hollywood happily-ever-after fade out. Gray's search 
for alternative therapies begins in an ophthalmologist (rhymes with 
monologuist) office, where he's encouraged to get "a little macula scraping." 
</P>
<P>
 Minor surgery? Gray is off and running for a cure, a cause, a clinic -- 
anything to avoid that eye-scrape. Maybe the ailment surfaced because he writes 
in the first person: " . . . too much I, I, I, I, I!" Maybe it was caused by 
his novel "Impossible Vacation," with the detached examination of his mother's 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray grew up in a Christian Science home, where "correct thinking" offered the 
only cure. His poignant memories of childhood underscore the desperation. His 
therapist, "an existential realist and graduate of Auschwitz," offers little 
consolation: "All things are contingent, and there is also chaos." So Gray 
pursues radical nutritionists, a Native American sorceress and "the Elvis 
Presley of psychic surgeons." 
</P>
<P>
 He tries everything. Raw vegetables. Gestalt screams. Gives up alcohol and 
amino acids. Takes out a personal ad: "Let's share puckers." He even returns, 
briefly, to Christian Science prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lull when we assume that the piece's climax is the eye operation. 
But Gray is a trickster, and the goal of his "Anatomy" is not physical but 
spiritual healing. "I believe in magic," confesses the lifelong ironist and 
cynic. "I believe that there has to be real magic if there are tricks in the 
world. And what is a trick if not an imitation of real magic?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's a magician of words whose enchanted "Anatomy" is the best cure for what 
ails him -- and us. See it. 
</P>

POP BEAT: PAVEMENT AT A CROSSROAD; PALACE APPEARANCE THRUSTS GROUP FROM CULT

 Even as they poke their heads warily into the glare of wide acclaim, 
underground heroes Pavement hang on to their reputation as a willfully contrary 
band, still willing to subvert their potential popularity with performances 
that indulge their experimental urges and slacker ambivalence. 
</P>
<P>
 But there wasn't any attitude getting in the way on Thursday at the Palace, 
where the quintet staked a claim in the front ranks of new American bands. The 
show was focused and straightforward but never dull or predictable, and the 
band's vigorous playing enhanced the attributes of its recent "Crooked Rain, 
Crooked Rain" album. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavement, which formed in Stockton five years ago, has evolved far beyond its 
initial dissonant mission and now it has roots in some key arteries of American 
pop -- primarily country-rock and the Velvet Underground. Throw in some punk, 
Devo and chirpy, buoyant pop, plus a nod to maverick visionaries such as 
Captain Beefheart, and you have a lot of room to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Malkmus' voice is wobbly but determined, troubled but amused as it 
sings about isolation, family conflicts and the uncertainty of committing to a 
rock 'n' roll life whose promise is in doubt. Instead of the usual Angst 
-ridden approach, these themes are often stated with a charming obliqueness, 
and there's a resonance to their self-referential imagery that matches the 
exhilarating lift in the music. 
</P>
<P>
 It all came across sounding great at the Palace, with the rhythm section 
strong and driving and co-founders Malkmus' and Scott Kannberg's guitar 
interplay edgy and inventive. Woozy harmonies and off-kilter beats kept things 
off-center enough to keep you on your toes -- this is lively, alert music that 
follows impulses and retains rough edges, and in the manner of the best rock 
bands the musicians seem to be tapping a force that surprises them as well as 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The enthusiasm and energy of the playing and the physicality of 
percussionist-backup singer Bob Nastanovich were tempered somewhat by an air of 
reserve in the on-stage posture of Malkmus, the band's focal point in concert. 
Pavement might be reaching out, but it's not about to completely abandon its 
touch of mystery -- the members have discarded their old silly synonyms, but 
their names aren't mentioned in the record company biography. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cult bands inevitably arrive at this crossroads where some kind of 
accommodation between independence and ambition, accessibility and integrity 
must be reached. The notion that music is best when it remains obscure is 
repeatedly disproved, but it's still an alluring one. Pavement's rejection of 
it is almost as exhilarating as the music they make.

ART REVIEW; FACULTY SHOW IS A GRADE ABOVE THE OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faculty art shows often seem unsatisfying, mostly because people get hired to 
teach art for all sorts of reasons that may not have much to do with the power 
and freshness of their own current work. But during the past few years, under 
Catherine Lord's leadership, the art department at UC Irvine has made a point 
of hiring artists as visiting or permanent faculty who are fairly bursting with 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "FACULTY/STAFF: NEW WORK," at the UCI Fine Arts Gallery through April 
30, has its share of pieces that seem didactic or just plain puzzling, it 
probably is the best -- and certainly the most generously eclectic -- faculty 
art show I've ever seen in Orange County. (Actually, the show encompasses not 
only art department faculty but also the technical staff, the people who run 
the labs in sculpture, photography, video and so forth, as well as the gallery 
itself.) 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite pieces in the show -- by Mara Lonner, Young Soon Min, Steve 
Criqui, Jacci Den Hartog, Judie Bamber and Renee Petropoulos -- have strong 
visual presence as well as conceptual twists that are rooted in aspects of 
contemporary life. Shelby Roberts' work is more straightforward, yet its 
tinkerer's delight in basic materials has an irresistible appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonner's "Screen" is a screen door on which the image of a formal gate with 
floral motifs has been "embroidered" in 32-gauge wire. The winsome-looking 
piece is actually intriguingly complex: It merges a traditionally upper-class 
female sewing skill with a mass-produced object sold in hardware stores, and 
the resulting hybrid involves such diverse topics as the expressive content of 
design and the home as a semipermeable fortress. 
</P>
<P>
 By superimposing the image of an ornamental physical barrier for trespassers 
(the gate) on a real barrier for flies (the screen door), and by subverting the 
viewer's expectations of the scope and materials appropriate either to mass 
production or an embroidery project, Lonner underlines the idea of "screens" of 
all kinds as arbitrary mental constructs. 
</P>
<P>
 Visually, the piece is absolutely enchanting, with a delicately uneven, 
"handmade" look, reinforcing the notion of design as personal expression within 
a social context that determines the range of permissible forms, and how their 
encoded information is understood. (Floral imagery on even the most formidably 
constructed gate conveys a polite welcome.) 
</P>
<P>
 In a related but different vein, Min's gateway piece, "Passing," consists of 
layered strips of metal "curtain" (mimicking the fabric partitions in a 
traditional Asian home) that viewers must slide through or push aside to get 
from one part of the gallery to another. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each curtain strip is inscribed on either side with contrasting phrases that 
serve as labels for the mirror images of viewers moving through the piece. 
Whatever their political motivation, these phrases mostly reflect 
one-dimensional images and stereotypes: "Model minority" and "dragon lady" 
versus "lesbian" and "radical social materialist." Various meanings of passing 
are at the heart of the work: "Going by without noticing," "Satisfying given 
requirements," and "Being barely acceptable as a substitute." Passing -- for 
members of minority and majority groups alike -- inevitably means fitting into 
some predetermined mold rather than being accepted as a unique and perhaps 
contradictory individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Criqui's painting "Temporal Garden" merges abstraction and popular culture in 
a way that has become his sprightly trademark. Brightly colored overlapping 
abstract forms resembling stoplights, billboards and movie tickets form an 
urban "landscape" against a swath of blue sky. The luscious piece of scalloped 
yellow plastic that serves as a frame is reminiscent of a fast-food restaurant 
sign; you practically expect it to revolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Using digital technology, Criqui reveals another side of his blend of the 
quotidian and the self-consciously "artistic" by transforming small photos of 
bland architecture into cultural jokes. A ridiculously arbitrary floating pole 
and bushes that float in midair like abstract blocks of texture give an 
innocuous suburban house facade the deadpan aura of a Magritte painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Den Hartog's gloppy rubber and plaster pieces look almost like something made 
with one of those deliberately "disgusting" kits marketed to children 
fascinated by human excretions. But the artist uses the oozing effects to 
supply alternative versions of all sorts of unlikely things, as in "Chinese 
Landscape With Spring and Summer Foliage." 
</P>
<P>
 Protruding from the gallery wall just inches above the floor, the piece is a 
compact blob of yellowish hills and crevices covered with a dripping blanket of 
green -- a wonderfully bizarre cross between the generalized look of distant 
landscape in a traditional Chinese painting and the effects of certain types of 
glazing in traditional Chinese ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
 Bamber's big subject is sexual warfare. In her satirical cartoon-like 
watercolor "How Do You Give a Woman an Orgasm? Who Cares," a saucy, tiny nude 
in stockings, high heels and long gloves is shown accommodating her booted male 
lover, being scolded by a wagging male forefinger for perusing Playboy 
magazine, getting the short end of the wishbone when she dreams of acquiring a 
penis, and ultimately falling asleep by herself. As in her oil paintings, which 
usually contain miniaturized objects in vast empty spaces, Bamber uses scale to 
emphasize pain, indifference and subjugation. 
</P>
<P>
 Petropoulos' tantalizing small circular paintings are titled with men's or 
women's names, but the "portraits" turn out to be mostly images of mutated 
headgear. "Frank" is a mortarboard piled high with unidentifiable red fruit; 
"Samantha" is a red and green chef's toque. If these hats are keys to their 
sitters' identities, what do they tell us? Is someone's job, education, diet or 
nationality (red and green are common flag colors) an accurate measure of who 
the person is? Or do we just unthinkingly believe that? 
</P>
<P>
 The charm of Roberts' pieces derives from being made entirely of stuff you can 
buy in a hardware store: peg board, hooks, C-clamps. "Bird," which flaps its 
huge jigsaw-cut hardboard wings when you tug on a penknife attached by a 
string, is suspended from the ceiling next to an untitled pegboard piece 
sporting an octagonal wood frame that looks like a birdhouse opening, and a 
scattering of hooks resembling perches. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other work in the show, such as Andrew Freeman's photo-and-text 
piece "North and South," is intriguing without seeming quite resolved. Images 
of featureless landscape, ugly apartment complexes and a truck stop accompany 
Freeman's musings about the conjunction of speed, daydreaming, familiar 
roadside objects, commuting and freeway accidents. Couched in more accessible, 
more precise language, these thoughts might be less elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several works are problematic in one way or another, the biggest 
disappointment comes from the artist with the biggest reputation, Daniel J. 
Martinez, whose installation "The Sport of Kings and Queens" consists of a 
white mannequin head wearing a dreadlocked wig and a knit cap, a graduated 
stack of myriad bottles and glasses holding a thick white liquid, and paintings 
on velvet of the English royal couple. 
</P>
<P>
 The "sport of kings" is horse racing, and the containers presumably are 3-D 
representations of blood line diagrams for racehorses -- in which all the 
"blood" is white. The point seems to be that the unofficial sport of European 
royalty is subjugating nonwhite peoples while borrowing aspects of their 
culture at will (as the mannequin does). Unless this reading misstates the 
point of the piece, it seems a lifeless, over-literal restatement of an 
unfortunate historical truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The show also embraces the diverse sensibilities of Judy Baca, Karen Carson, 
Eva Cockcroft, Jane Cottis, John Di Stephano, Cecilia Dougherty, Karin Higa, 
Tom Jenkins, Ulysses Jenkins, Betty Lee, Eve Luckring, Gifford Myers, Catherine 
Opie, Connie Samaras, Joseph Santarromana, Lisa Schoyer, Jerome Thomas, Anne 
Walsh, Pat Ward Williams and John White.

 'Freedom' Restricted: The "Freedom of Leonard Peltier" benefit concerts 
featuring Rage Against the Machine, Cypress Hill, X, the Beastie Boys and other 
bands scheduled for Thursday and Friday have been moved from the Hollywood 
Palladium to the Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills because of the venue's 
policy against booking rap shows. A spokesman for the Palladium said the rap 
acts were added after the show was booked for organizers Rage Against the 
Machine, and he would not comment about the timing of the cancellation. Due to 
the change of venue, there will be only one concert, on Friday, but tickets 
from both Palladium shows will be honored and 2,000 additional tickets go on 
sale today. The show will be general admission and doors will open at 4 p.m. 
The concert had already been rescheduled from earlier in April because Rage 
Against the Machine bassist Timmy C. was injured in a biking accident.

Washington on May 10 and 12. Tickets were offered to "anyone who addresses 
issues that touch our industry," said Tim Sites, spokesman for the recording 
association. Lawmakers must buy the tickets at their $50 to $350 face value. 
Eight have asked for tickets so far, Sites said on Thursday. TELEVISION

 Letterboxing on NBC: NBC will tread new waters Sunday night by letterboxing

"Climb Every Mountain," and the final escape. A network spokesman says this is 
the first time NBC has used the process, which presents widescreen images on 
the nearly square TV screen by running black bands above and below the picture 
-- a practice sometimes used on cable, videocassettes and laser discs. NBC also 
plans to telecast parts of "El Cid" in letterbox this summer. "We're just

MUSIC REVIEW; HENDRICKS, SCHEJA RETURN TO PAVILION IN RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Connoisseurs had a hard time Thursday night when Barbara Hendricks returned to 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 In an esoteric but illuminating recital, often exquisitely sung, the 
much-admired American soprano displayed some of the virtues for which she has 
been celebrated: a wondrous vocal control anchored in solid technique; myriad 
skills in communicating sense and feeling, including clear but unobtrusive 
enunciation; most cherishably, a simplicity of presentation that puts all 
emphasis on text and music, never on the performer. 
</P>
<P>
 On this occasion, however, not all was well. Hendricks' silvery voice showed 
some tarnishing and wear as the evening progressed. Occasional quaveriness, a 
few moments of under-pitch attacks and hints of vocal fatigue -- in particular 
in her third encore, Schubert's "Ave Maria" -- rose up to worry the observer. 
</P>
<P>
 More damaging to the listener's sensibilities, however, was the distance put 
between artist and audience by dim lighting and small print in the program: The 
Pavilion's house lights had been raised, slightly, yet not high enough to make 
reading the texts easy; furthermore, those words seemed to be smaller in size 
than is comfortable for most readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the words to this collection of important but largely unfamiliar 
music, listeners were left to their own, sometimes slender devices. No wonder a 
number of them were seen leaving at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who stayed, the pleasures increased. After a true connoisseur's 
first half, made up of five Schubert lieder and seven by Richard Strauss, songs 
in which pianist Staffan Scheja and the soprano demonstrated the most fluent 
and effortless kinds of ensemble thinking and performing, there was no letup of 
intensity but a whole new second wind of pleasure in the music at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 That music included Alban Berg's practically irresistible Seven Early Songs, 
Poulenc's multilayered "Fiancailles pour rire" and four of Arnold Schoenberg's 
"Brettl-Lieder" (1901). Here, Hendricks/Scheja specified and delineated all the 
many moods and nuances in this emotional kaleidoscope without confusion, 
over-interpreting or, even for a moment, grandstanding. Everything was there 
except the self-congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Four encores remained to cap the evening: Faure's "Apres un reve"; Leo 
Delibes' "Les Filles de Cadix"; the aforementioned "Ave Maria," and "He's Got 
the Whole World in His Hands."

WOMEN'S WORKS: MINOR ACHIEVEMENT; SOPRANO PHILLIPS-THORNBURGH HEARS ARRESTED 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE PROGRAM BY HARMONIA BAROQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine Anne Boleyn, second wife of King Henry VIII and mother of Queen 
Elizabeth I, in the Tower of England, awaiting her beheading.  
</P>
<P>
 That is what soprano Maurita Phillips-Thornburgh thinks of when she sings "O 
deathe, rock me asleepe" (1536), a song attributed to Boleyn and one of a dozen 
works composed by "Women of the Baroque" to be performed on a program by that 
title Sunday in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The poetry ruminates about how the pleasures of her life are coming to an 
end, how it's a situation for which there is no remedy," said 
Phillips-Thornburgh, who will sing with the Harmonia Baroque Players at Christ 
Church by the Sea United Methodist. "She says, 'For now I die' at least six 
times at the end of each stanza, and references to death are otherwise 
sprinkled throughout the text. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can picture her captors coming to get her. You feel the sense of 
foreboding, the inescapable, the surety. It's hypnotic -- so transparent, so 
relentless and so compelling." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the works on the program, Phillips-Thornburgh said, are charming, 
pleasant and enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: a suite for harpsichord by Elizabeth-Claude Jacquet de la Guerre, 
who was declared a prodigy by Louis XIV and subsequently educated under the 
supervision of his mistress; a recorder sonata by Princess Anna Amalia von 
Preussen, youngest sister of Frederick the Great; a motet for soprano, 
recorder, violin and continuo by Isabella Leonarda, a nun who by the age of 80 
had produced 20 volumes of music, and arias by Camilla de Rossi and Maria 
Margharita Grimani, Northern Italians about whom almost nothing is known except 
that they weren't nuns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harmonia Baroque Players include founder Marika Frankl, recorders; 
Jennifer Wildeson, violin; Gregory Adamson, cello, and Barbara King, 
harpsichord. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips-Thornburgh is founder and artistic director of the Santa Monica-based 
vocal group Cantori Domino and has served as soprano soloist with the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic under such conductors as Sir George Solti, Zubin Mehta and 
Eugene Ormandy and with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra under Gerard 
Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Phillips-Thornburgh, known to almost everyone as Bunny, the 
Leonarda motet "Quam dulcis es" (1687), with its variety of musical forms and 
daring metrical and melodic devices, is the most developmentally sophisticated 
of the compositions; "O deathe . . ." the most harmonically sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a constant shift (in 'O deathe . . . ' ) from B-natural to B-flat, 
sometimes in the same measure," she said. "It's such a close interval. If the 
hall is resonant, you hear (the two tones) at the same time, which is how they 
would have been heard in the Tower of London. It's definitely about pain and 
the difference between finally being minor or major. Given the inevitability of 
Boleyn's fate, it finally ends up minor." 
</P>
<P>
 A fate, one might hope, not to be shared by other female composers of the 
Baroque. But Phillips-Thornburgh's assessment of the quality of these works 
doesn't auger well for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You certainly sense the ability and poetry and lyricism of these composers," 
she said. "But you sense even stronger an attempt, artistically and 
intellectually, to bind their feet. Developmentally there is not the interest 
-- none of the pieces we will perform show the developmental progress, even 
within the piece, of the (period's) most naive male composers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a certain sadness for these women. They clearly were given artistic 
and musical training -- to a point. They may have been an adornment to a court 
or church, but not (because) they genuinely had comparable intellect or ability 
or soul of their male counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear, however, that they understood the syntax," she said. "(Perhaps) 
if they were writing today in what appears to be a freer, more nourishing 
ambience . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Harmonia Baroque Players present works by "Women of the Baroque," Sunday 
at 7 p.m. at Christ Church by the Sea United Methodist, 1400 W. Balboa Blvd.,

PINK FLOYD SHOW WAS FINE WITHOUT SCREENS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Mike Boehm's critical comments about the lack of video screens at 
the Pink Floyd concert for close-in viewing of the band ("Floyd's Back, for 
Better and Worse," April 16). 
</P>
<P>
 In case you didn't notice it . . . there was a show going on. That would be 
like saying you did not like "Phantom of the Opera," because you could not see 
the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 I know it is in vogue to criticize any show that is commercially successful, 
but I have been attending concerts for more than 20 years, and this was one of 
the most complete and entertaining shows I have ever seen, from start to 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
 On this event, your review missed the mark entirely.

WORD ON THE STREET SCENE IS 'FAMILY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Street Scene, a two-day family art festival, will take place at Cal State 
Fullerton today and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The free event, part of countywide Imagination Celebration activities, will 
feature about 90 amateur and professional chalk artists who will create works 
in Parking Lot D, outside the Visual Arts building. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great family event because it appeals to little children and 
grandparents and everyone in between," said Lee Carlson, spokeswoman for the 
Art Alliance, a fund-raising organization for the university's art department. 
</P>
<P>
 The chalk artists will try to re-create the International Street Painting 
Festival, which takes place annually in Italy. Chalk art was popularized during 
the 16th Century, when artists transformed pavements into colorful canvases 
during religious celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling singers and Cal State Fullerton's Jazz Ensemble will perform both 
days. Dancers will also entertain visitors, and student artists will present 
weaving, pottery and T-shirt spraying demonstrations while a 
Vietnamese-American contemporary art exhibit will be on display in the Main 
Gallery. More than 3,000 people are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 For $10, children can buy colored chalk to use for their own creations, 
Carlson said. Proceeds from the events, food sales and sponsorships will raise 
money for scholarships for art students and to support the gallery.

THE RIGHT LOCATION FOR 'MAME'S' KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If "Mame" at the Glendale Alex Theater has "lost its kick" (" 'Mame' Loses Its 
Kick in Alex Staging," April 11), I'd like to find it and use it to kick Don 
Shirley right in the pants!  
</P>
<P>
 I was in a group of 10 the night we saw "Mame," and it charmed the husks right 
off of our corn! The production left all of us smiling, humming and feeling 
darn good about having attended.Our sentiments must have been shared by the 
audience, because both the orchestra section and balconies gave the show a 
rousing standing ovation! 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Juliet Prowse's voice, it was great for the part. None of the stars 
of "Mame" have been primarily singers. It's a comedic role. And, in answer to 
Shirley's comment that the story line is shallow, if someone is looking for a 
deep, inner meaning in an evening of theater, one does not usually look for it 
in musical theater. But isn't it wonderful to leave a theater feeling happy, 
refreshed, smiling and humming great tunes, not having had to squirm in our 
seats from being assaulted with foul language and graphic sex scenes?

CHEKHOV WAS BORED TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best part and valid part of Don Shirley's review of "The Wood Demon" was 
his first paragraph ("Fighting a Chekhovian 'Demon' at the Taper," April 8). 
Ah, if only Shirley had stopped there and accepted Chekhov's honesty, 
disappointment and disgust at having written a most talkative, boring play, a 
play that crawled on for more than three hours.The Chekhov experience was a 
sleeper, literally. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not critical of the acting and staging -- that was competent -- but being 
competent with a production that created a verbal sedative is not enough. 
Before the end of the third act, almost half of the audience was asleep and 
most of the others had gone home. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, the headline could be accepted as valid -- "Fighting a Chekhovian 
'Demon' at the Taper." Yes, the audience was fighting the "Demon" as long as it 
could, as long as it could keep its eyes open, and then, of course, it lost the 
fight.

'THE FOURTH WALL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re Richard Stayton's review of "The Fourth Wall" ("Gurney's 'The Fourth Wall' 
an Experiment in Error," March 22): My wife and I were in the audience the same 
night as your reviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, we enjoyed the play thoroughly, as did everyone around us in the 
very full audience.From the moment the curtain went up, revealing the 
breathtakingly superb set by Scott Heineman (which got applause but not a 
mention from Stayton), the audience was loving this play. The laughter started 
immediately. The lines were fresh, intelligent and very funny, and the show's 
concept was inventive and well realized. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also a number of delightful Cole Porter songs, performed 
hilariously by the inspired cast members and accompanied by a player grand 
piano. 
</P>
<P>
 My parting grumble is aimed at the last sentence in Stayton's snide review. 
"But in an effort to free American drama of aesthetic restraints, he (A.R. 
Gurney) constructed a classic example of why audiences flee the theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Please , I was there. I watched Gurney's audience, and they did not flee the 
theater. They walked out at a leisurely pace, laughing, content and I'm sure 
inspired to spread good word-of-mouth, the only antidote to critics who are 
lucky enough to temporarily find themselves in a position of great power.

GIS AND THE HOLOCAUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Saturday Letters column, April 16, Keith R. Matzinger of Camarillo, in 
commenting on the "well-deserved publicity" of "Schindler's List" ("Americans 
Gave Lives"), said he had "not seen a single mention of the thousands of 
Americans who gave their lives to end the Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
 The film, and any critique of it, does not address itself to the Allied 
invasion of Europe and the fight to destroy the German army.By the time of 
D-day, June 6, 1944, the fate of Europe's Jews had long been sealed. Probably 
two-thirds of prewar Jewry had already been killed one way or another. Our 
gallant U.S. and Allied soldiers fought their way across the Rhine in less than 
one year, but they did not even know that the death camps existed, and they 
were astounded by what they found in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Our high command, from Franklin D. Roosevelt down through the State 
Department, Gen. George C. Marshall and the rest, knew about the camps and the 
transport of Jews from all of Europe to Poland and eastern Germany but chose 
not to acknowledge the situation, lest our war effort be "diverted" from the 
primary task of wiping out Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Holocaust Memorial in Washington, and probably every other Holocaust 
memorial, does honor the GIs who assisted in the liberation of the death camps 
and who gave succor to the pitiable, and pitifully few, survivors.

$9 MILLION SURE CAN BUY A HEAP OF BLUES; CLUBS: THE SPARE-NO-EXPENSE HOUSE OF 
BLUES WILL OFFER LIVE MUSIC NIGHTLY STARTING MAY 1 ON THE SUNSET STRIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Near a crossroads in Clarksdale, Miss., where, according to legend, blues 
singer Robert Johnson gave his soul to the devil to play the blues, stands an 
old cotton mill. Isaac Tigrett recently bought it and carted off the corrugated 
metal that covered the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that battered metal adorns the exterior of the House of Blues, Tigrett's 
new Sunset Strip nightclub, which opened Friday with an invitation-only party 
featuring a scheduled performance by Aerosmith, one of the club's investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The inaugural celebration continues with invitational fund-raisers featuring 
such artists as Taj Mahal (tonight) and Etta James (Tuesday). A Magic Johnson 
Foundation fund-raiser next Saturday will spotlight Elwood Blues (club investor 
Dan Aykroyd) & the Blues Brothers, James Brown, Isaac Hayes, John Lee Hooker 
and others. Although the dingy metal siding is a sharp contrast with the 
ornate, three-tier temple of blues inside, Tigrett wanted authenticity. He even 
brought back some Mississippi mud and spread it around the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 All that was the easy part. Now Tigrett, who also operates House of Blues 
clubs in Cambridge, Mass., and New Orleans, has to demonstrate that his 
$9-million venue is a viable music club in a city whose club creed is "live 
fast, die young." 
</P>
<P>
 Some promoters and industry veterans think that House of Blues, which will 
offer live music seven nights a week starting May 1, will find its niche in 
L.A.'s club scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're definitely going to give the Palace a run for their money," says 
Tracy Buie, a talent buyer with Avalon Attractions, L.A.'s leading concert 
promotion firm. "When the Palace opened in '83, it had the feeling of something 
brand new. It was beautifully furnished and it had state-of-the-art lights and 
sound system. That's the feel of the House of Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Tigrett, 45, isn't sparing any expense. The sound system is worth 
half a million dollars, and the walls are adorned with an exceptional 
collection of African American, folk and "outsider" art -- part of his desire 
to illustrate the history of the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 All the woodwork, from the bars to the doors, is made of antique pieces that 
Tigrett has collected from around the world. Other pieces, such as the 
bas-relief plaster faces of blues greats that make up the main room's ceiling, 
and the dining room's 75-foot bar, were created by artists specifically for the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Blues can also alter its design to fit the size of the crowd. 
When the house is packed (capacity is 1,000), the wall behind the second 
floor's bar disappears and allows restaurant guests to look directly at the 
stage. When the crowd is smaller, the wall stays up, creating a feeling of 
intimacy.  
</P>
<P>
 Harold Bronson, managing director of Rhino Records, a Los Angeles-based label 
with an extensive blues reissue catalogue, is impressed by the club's attention 
to detail. "The sensitivity to carry lumber from India and the metal from 
Mississippi is amazing," he says. "So much of what he's doing is in line with 
Rhino's philosophy to (inspire) people with the music's history." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its name, the club has established a diverse booking policy. Although 
the acts will be 60% blues artists, Tigrett will also present rap, country, 
gospel, R&B and rock, and will also work with outside promoters. 
</P>
<P>
 The announced acts so far include '70s soul giant Isaac Hayes (May 1), country 
singer Faith Hill (May 2), Huey Lewis & the News (May 13), jazzman Maynard 
Ferguson (May 24) and Little Richard (June 21). Pure blues will be represented 
by such artists as Junior Wells, Little Milton, Koko Taylor, Johnny (Clyde) 
Copeland, Otis Rush, et al. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to give the complete history here," says Tigrett. "Rap, for example, 
is very much contemporary urban blues. Like rap, blues was the bad boys. . . . 
As long as the music has its roots in blues, you'll find it here."  
</P>
<P>
 Now that it's ready to roll, the question remains: In this land of illusion, 
will the House of Blues prove to be merely another facade, albeit one with 
sturdy siding? 
</P>
<P>
 "How much is spiritual and how much is showmanship really doesn't matter," 
says Rhino's Bronson. "Because the result is still the same. It's a premier 
showcase for blues acts that also manages to expose people to the music's rich 
history."

DANCE REVIEW; L.A. TROUPE MIXES NEW, OLD AT BOVARD AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louise Reichlin and Alfred Desio, mainstays of Los Angeles Choreographers and 
Dancers, combined new and old pieces for an occasionally exciting free concert 
of tap and modern dance in Bovard Auditorium at USC on Thursday night. Both 
choreographers seemed to reach for inspiration from ritual activity -- Desio 
sticking with the casual rituals of tap, and Reichlin on less stable ground, 
mining what she clearly imagines to be the exotic Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichlin's 1992 "Turkish Delights," set to traditional music, contain scenes 
that range from a folk dance section with modern steps thrown in, to a 
questionable Dervish-inspired (and costumed) piece using movement based on the 
sacred religious practice of whirling (with modern steps thrown in). Lots of 
sinewy hands, sultry gazes and sensually unfolding limbs set the whole work up 
as a modern dance version of the second-act, ethnic dances from "The 
Nutcracker," something that's possibly not needed at this moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Radiating the most heat of the evening was the premiere of Desio's 
"Brandenburg Boogie," for which he was joined by four personable young tappers 
from Colburn Kids Tap/L.A. In a solo full of satisfying synchronicity, Desio 
did what we all long to do -- keep up with the Bach beat. And in a traditional 
tap lineup, all five dancers whipped through clever, quirky canon and unison 
steps. Even the weakly projected taped music couldn't spoil the mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the program were selections from Reichlin's perennially popular and 
still witty "The Tennis Dances," previously reviewed in these pages. Especially 
delightful was Allison Higa, as a ferocious player who whipped on and offstage 
like an elegant tornado. Higa also shone in the "Together" section of 
Reichlin's "Urban and Tribal Dances," selections from which were otherwise 
unremarkable. JENNIFER FISHER

THEATER REVIEW; 'MERLIN': MERCILESS AND WITHOUT MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Academic hubris is common. Insulated in an ivory tower, surrounded by a moat 
of tenure, empowered by worshipful students, professors can easily be swept 
away in self-delusion. Call it the bunker mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years German playwright Tankred Dorst's epic about the Knights of the 
Round Table has been seeking an American premiere. Alas, "Merlin" has finally 
found a Camelot in California Repertory Company, thanks to director Ronald 
Allan-Lindblom and the Goethe Institut. During its mystifying six hours, 
"Merlin" casts a smell of disenchantment over Cal State Long Beach's Studio 
Theatre that pungently illustrates why other American theaters avoided it like 
the Black Death. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it "Merlin the Merciless." 
</P>
<P>
 Meet the Puppets of the Square Table -- pretentious, preposterous and 
pathetic. Dorst and co-author Ursula Ehler's self-indulgent Clicheland makes 
Lerner and Loewe's musical "Camelot" seem like the cutting edge of 
post-modernism. By comparison, "Merlin" magically transforms "Monty Python and 
the Holy Grail" into serious art. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently, Allan-Lindblom approached the 229-page script and its 265 roles 
with a child's innocence. Rather than spectacle, he chose storybook special 
effects, minimalizing Dorst's attempts to merge Sir Thomas Mallory's 
15th-Century poem "Morte d'Arthure" with post-World War II German symbolism. 
Dorst's original German title translates as "Merlin, or the Wasteland," 
implying that this must contain symbols from the contemporary German theater of 
Sturm und Drang. But what we see at Cal Rep is what we get -- boys playing 
knights. 
</P>
<P>
 A metal scaffolding serves as the various castles. Lots of strobes and fog and 
music, but no Knights in armor galloping on imaginary steeds, as in Ariane 
Mnouchkine's inventive Olympic Arts Festival Shakespearean histories. These 
knights wear black leather jackets as armor and sunglasses as helmets. But 
instead of behaving like a modern urban gang, the object of their obsession 
remains that elusive Holy Grail. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 An unseen storyteller narrates from loudspeakers, providing intrusive, 
irrelevant commentary, such as, "Merlin wrung his hands and groaned . . . " 
Merlin is potentially a fascinating guide for audiences, especially as realized 
by shaven-headed, intense Richard P. Gang, but is gradually exiled off-stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Born of an unholy union between Satan and Woman (we witness the absurd birth, 
staged in the pit), Merlin defies his dad's Faustian temptations. So our 
magician embarks on a Mission Impossible: Make humanity grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a problem: You gotta have a round table. Our sorcerer's apprentice 
becomes a kid named Arthur (an indefatigable Blake Steury). "This table has to 
be a representation of the world," the kid-King explains to a carpenter, "and 
it must seat over a hundred knights. No corners. No inferior seats." Alas, the 
carpenter can't deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 So Arthur marries a woman named Guinevere (Kimberly Seder as Valley Girl 
Queen). She accuses the King of wanting her only for her large round table. 
Guinevere stomps her foot and shouts, "I am not frigid! Exceptional people have 
exceptional feelings!" 
</P>
<P>
 The kicks in Part II come from watching Guinevere redecorate her new digs at 
Sir Lancelot's castle. Domestic bliss dissolves into acrimony when those 
petulant knights want revenge. "You come down and fight," a knight shouts at 
the light booth. Slow-motion sword fights proliferate, resembling Super Mario's 
struggles in a kid-vid dungeon. Satan triumphs, Merlin's bummed, and as for the 
audience caught in Cal Rep's headlights? 
</P>
<P>
 Prominently displayed in the theater's lobby are warning signs: "THERE WILL BE 
NO LATE SEATING AFTER 8:15." Want this reviewer's advice? Arrive at 8:16. 
</P>

TV REVIEW; CBS' 'YEARLING' A WORTHWHILE REMAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS' remake of the beloved 1946 Oscar-winning movie "The Yearling" is ample 
evidence of the lingering lure of the agrarian myth and the myth of the rural 
family in the American imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything about this production -- its primitive, addictive environment, its 
uncomplicated characters, its wild animal kingdom -- harks to a past that is 
not so much romantic as it is isolated, lonely and, not least, wondrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-starring Peter Strauss and Jean Smart as a hardscrabble husband and wife 
farming a swampy patch of scrub forest in the spectacular Everglades in 1920s 
Florida, the movie will not disappoint fans of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' 
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel or of the old MGM movie (which starred Gregory 
Peck, Jane Wyman and Claude Jarman Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 50 years later, the appeal of "The Yearling" is not only unchanged, 
it's probably stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 The impossible-to-pin-down Smart (whose every dramatic performance seems 
wildly different from her last) is particularly affecting as a stern, laconic 
mom whose no-nonsense approach to her lot in life masks swamp waters that 
indeed run deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Peck before him, Strauss' good looks initially seem wrong for the role of 
the dirt farmer plowing the marshes. But (also mirroring Peck's achievement) 
Strauss' easygoing style goes on to create a sturdy, becalming figure who 
warmly balances the flinty Smart. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple has already lost three children; their only surviving child is a 
pre-adolescent son (the convincing Wil Horneff) who is compelled to become a 
man before his time. In a shattering decision, the youth must decide the fate 
of his pet fawn, the entitled yearling (captured by a combination of clever 
intercutting and some remarkable animal training). 
</P>
<P>
 But make no mistake, this is not Bambi territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The harshness of nature is unflinchingly depicted and keeps the movie, briskly 
directed by Rod Hardy from a solid script by Joe Wiesenfeld, free of cheap 
sentiment. On the contrary, the picture's sentiment is earned, as in the young 
boy's bedside vigil over the corpse of a boyhood friend or a later, lovely 
scene in which Strauss reduces Smart to tears with the magical gift of a black 
lace dress. 
</P>
<P>
 For a movie in which hunting and communing with exotic flora and fauna are so 
basic (and richly lensed by cinematographer David Connell), the pace never 
flags. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Yearling" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

UNSPORTSMANLIKE TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re Howard Rosenberg on Jim Rome/Jim Everett ("Can't Put Down C-SPAN's 
'Booknotes,' " April 8): 
</P>
<P>
 As a former coach and teacher, I'm amazed at what has happened to 
"sportsmanship" in recent years. The trend is on "in-your-face bravado" and 
"trash" or "smack" talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome, in his recent clash with Everett, is an example. Rome's reputation seems 
to be built on encouraging the movement away from any form of sportsmanship. He 
rewards the outlandish; he is outlandish. He is the unquestionable ambassador 
of "smack" talk. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm amazed that a quality network like ESPN doesn't see that this trend is not 
a healthy one. It should replace Rome with a host who understands the meaning 
of the term and take steps to reverse the trend. It's past time!

A FLAGRANT FOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am angry at and deeply disappointed by Cathy Curtis' review of " 'Very' 
Visual Dialogue -- Personal Journeys in Abstract Painting" exhibition (which 
includes some of my works), ("Dowell Works Provide Powerful Lift to So-So 
Show," March 14). 
</P>
<P>
 The simple purpose of the exhibition was threefold: (1) to allow each artist 
to be represented by pivotal old and new works so that the viewer could 
understand the evolution of the artwork itself, (2) to allow students and 
non-artist viewers an insight into how artists can be affected by each other's 
personality and artworks; and (3) perhaps the most experimental element of the 
exhibition -- an attempt to create a purely visual dialogue through careful 
arrangement of the different artworks in the gallery space. 
</P>
<P>
 This dialogue would be accomplished as the artworks' inherent formal elements 
(line, shape, form, color, texture, composition, and size) played off one 
another across the room, causing a heightened and charged viewing experience 
for the gallery visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Background-researched critical analysis and honest evaluation of the actual 
artwork are invaluable. It helps the artist's personal growth and expands the 
art viewing audience. Your non-contextual reading of this show that uses 
conjectural phrases like self-serving, self effacing; and funny jargon like 
low-key wallpaper, glibness, tiredness haunts, dispiriting thinness, 
keep-up-your-spirits tune, vaguely suggestive of a game board to describe 
serious painting endeavor are inexcusable. 
</P>
<P>
 Your flagrant writing style helps absolutely no one but you.

DESMARAIS HAD HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to expand on the comments Stuart Spence made in his letter 
(Letters, April 9) in regard to the contribution of the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure that the Laguna Art Museum will continue to be a vital asset to 
Orange County and to California (in the wake of the firing of director Charles 
Desmarais). Yes, Charles Desmarais made an important contribution, but he was 
not acting alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission of the museum, since its origins as an art association in 1918, is 
to present the art of California, both present and past. That it has succeeded 
in this undertaking is evident not only in the fine contemporary exhibitions, 
but also in the historical shows it has organized over the last several years 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 These were developed during the tenure of the last three directors, Tom Enman, 
Bill Otton and Desmarais. Curator (and now acting director) Susan Anderson has 
worked diligently at this endeavor, along with able guest curators such as Dr. 
Patricia Trenton and Nancy Moure. 
</P>
<P>
 Trenton's show, "California Light, 1900 to 1930," from 1990, was one of the 
most successful exhibitions of the museum to that date, and traveled to the 
Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento, the Dixon Gallery and Gardens in Memphis, and 
the Montclair Art Museum in Montclair, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Moure recently presented "Loners, Mavericks and Dreamers: Art in Los Angeles 
Before 1900" (November, 1993, to February, 1994). Anderson has presented 
numerous exhibitions that pay tribute to the art heritage of California, 
including the groundbreaking "Dream and Perspective, the American Scene in 
Southern California, 1930 to 1945" in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, and perhaps more important, she has succeeded in presenting a balance 
of exhibitions that pay tribute both to the past and the present in California 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been my privilege to have enjoyed a more than 10-year association with 
the Laguna Art Museum in various capacities, both as a volunteer and as a guest 
curator. 
</P>
<P>
 No institutions are free of problems. I think that the staff, the volunteers, 
and the board members should be encouraged and thanked for the fine jobs they 
have accomplished.

INTERIORS; LET THE BRIGHT, FRESH LOOK OF SPRING COME IN FROM THE COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARESA ARCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that spring is in the air, thoughts are turning to the outdoors, to 
sprucing up the patio furniture and planting flowers in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, in the rush to get out, the inside of the house gets left in its 
winter doldrums. With a little time and imagination though, a house's interior 
can, like a garden, be transformed with the seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few tips from professional designers for bringing the bright, fresh 
look of spring into your home with a minimal expenditure of energy and cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedrooms can be transformed from their heavy winter look -- beds piled high 
with blankets and heavy comforters -- by changing the bedding. What could be 
easier than changing the sheets and bedspread or comforter? "You can have one 
bedroom design for winter and one for spring and summer," said Carolyn M. 
Wuille, whose interior design business is based in Irvine. "White cotton with 
Battenburg lace is a great (warm weather) look." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the dust ruffle neutral to the seasons can make the change even 
easier. If you have round tables and night stands, change the cloth to a bright 
spring shade or match it with the new spring sheets. A matching tablecloth can 
be made easily from an additional sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Dining rooms or eat-in kitchens can be spruced up for sunny weather by 
changing tablecloths or place mats. Sunflower motifs are the hottest things 
this season, and accessories with the bright yellow flowers can be found at 
most discount stores. Changing small details such as the kitchen towels and pot 
holders helps create a fresh environment. 
</P>
<P>
 When choosing fabrics for bed linens and tablecloths, designer Terri Salazar 
of Kitchen Del Mar in Corona del Mar suggests staying with the color schemes 
already in the house but choosing lighter hues. Fresh flowers also make an 
interior brighter, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Another trick for making a room seem brighter is to use glass accessories 
instead of pottery. "Glass vases and bowls add a designer touch but do not take 
up visual space," Salazar said. Transparent objects do not "stop" the eye the 
way solid objects do. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long-lasting spring look, nothing beats potted flowering plants, 
according to Lisa Weber, who heads her design business in Fullerton. The key to 
keeping plants healthy and in bloom is to rotate them from outdoors inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "My house does not have enough light to keep plants blooming," Weber said. "So 
I buy three or four plants and rotate them once a week. This way I have a show 
of flowers inside as well as on the patio." 
</P>
<P>
 If you have more time and a modest budget, changing window treatments can add 
a new lighter look to any room. Drapes are too cumbersome to change, but 
replacing curtains or mini-blinds with light colored fabric casually draped is 
an inexpensive way to update a room's look for spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing you can do is bring as much of the outdoors in as possible," 
said Lana Barth, a Huntington Beach interior designer. "To do that you want to 
keep the view from the windows as unobstructed as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Barth suggests using natural colored gauze or even cheesecloth for windows. If 
there are already curtain rods, simply drape the cloth over the rod. If you 
must hang a new rod, a lightly stained wood rod is a good bet. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do have heavy drapery, try putting up a new valance or using new 
drapery ties to freshen the look for spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Painting the walls is always a good way to brighten a room, but who wants to 
paint twice a year just to cater to the changing seasons? A simple way to use 
paint seasonally is to limit the amount of surface being painted. Only paint 
the trim in a room, or, if you have old wood furniture, don't be afraid to 
experiment on it with paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not paint a tabletop white and then paint each of the chairs a vibrant 
color?" Wuille suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Slipcovers are a popular way to change the fabric on sofas and armchairs, but 
do not overlook the kitchen chairs, Wuille said. "Straight-back chairs can get 
a dramatic new look with simple tie-on slipcovers." 
</P>
<P>
 For a big change, replace heavy area rugs with natural sisal rugs, Wuille 
added. "Actual sisal is great for spring and summer because it's light and 
casual. Pick a flat weave and you can even stencil a border to pick up motifs 
in your house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just make sure it's a large-scale stencil so the pattern doesn't get lost in 
the nubby texture of the rug."

HOME SAFETY; VINTAGE ORANGE DISHWARE POSES THREAT FROM RADON GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK ROYLANCE, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bright orange Fiesta dishware that many Americans use and collect could be 
giving off enough radon gas to pose a significant health risk, a geologist 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we test homes and look for radon, we always suppose it comes from the 
ground," said Rudolph Hon of Boston College. "Maybe we need to make the public 
aware that some of it can be coming from the cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiesta ceramics made before 1972 "should be always considered as suspect" in 
homes where radon levels are high, concluded Hon and a graduate student, 
Christopher Zeman, in a paper presented recently in Binghamton, N.Y., to a 
meeting of the Geological Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The dishes' radioactive properties -- gamma ray emissions from uranium-based 
paint in the bright orange variety -- have been known for decades. The finding 
that the paint is also producing significant amounts of radon gas is new, Hon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiesta dishware sold by the millions in the 1930s and 1940s, and became one of 
the largest-selling lines in the country. It has recently become popular again 
among collectors, and is widely available in antique shops and flea markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeman, 22, said the study found that a single Fiesta plate in an unventilated, 
15-by-15-foot room would produce radioactive radon gas at 28 picocuries per 
liter -- a concentration seven times the level considered safe by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The gas, radon-222, is produced by the gradual decay of uranium-238. 
</P>
<P>
 The radon is believed to escape from the plates through microscopic cracks in 
the glaze. Fiesta ware in other colors is not radioactive, Hon said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the radiation to which Americans are exposed each year is 
believed to come from naturally occurring radon. It is a Class A carcinogen, 
ranked by the federal government in the same category with secondhand tobacco 
smoke, benzene and asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 Emitted from rocks and soil and accumulated in poorly ventilated homes, radon 
may be responsible for up to 20,000 lung cancer deaths a year in the United 
States, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. However, the 
National Research Council suggests the EPA's figure may be too high. 
</P>
<P>
 In those homes found to have high levels of radon, the EPA recommends using 
good ventilation in the home to reduce exposures to a level of 4 picocuries per 
liter or below. (In Southern California, the incidence of problems with 
naturally occurring radon gas are much lower than in other parts of the 
country.) 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Marcinowski, a health physiologist with the EPA's radon division, said 
his agency has asked Hon for more information on his study. 
</P>
<P>
 Radon emissions from Fiesta ware are "perfectly feasible," he said. "The 
isotopes I'm aware of in the Fiesta ware glazing are parent isotopes of radon." 
If Hon's radon measurements are accurate, Marcinowski said, "that level is 
definitely a cause for concern." 
</P>
<P>
 The dishware -- most of it marked "Fiesta" and "Made in U.S.A." on the bottom 
-- was manufactured by the Homer Laughlin China Co. in Newell, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe Fiesta is the largest-selling dinner line in the history of the 
industry," said David Conley, the company's national sales manager. Twelve 
million pieces in a variety of colors were shipped annually at its peak in the 
1930s and 1940s, and perhaps 200 million in all since it was introduced in 
1936. 
</P>
<P>
 The uranium-bearing orange variety was discontinued in 1943 when the 
government placed wartime restrictions on uranium. Production resumed in 1959 
when the restrictions were lifted and continued until 1972. In 1976, the 
company reintroduced the Fiesta line, but the orange color could not be 
duplicated with the new lead- and uranium-free glazes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fiesta ware in its original colors has become a collector's item, and prices 
have climbed accordingly. A dinner plate that sold for 35 cents in 1936 is now 
worth $25 to $30, Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other brand names that used uranium-based pigments included Caliente, Early 
California, Poppytrail, Stangl and Vistosa, according to the federal Food and 
Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 For consumers, the uranium in Fiesta ware poses health issues that differ from 
those associated with radon gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The ionizing radiation from uranium can be a cancer hazard, depending on its 
strength, duration and distance from the body. If ingested, uranium is 
chemically harmful to the kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that highly acidic foods can 
leach uranium from Fiesta ware at levels ranging from 24 to 1,600 times those 
considered safe for drinking water. The study said acidic foods, such as tomato 
sauce, sauerkraut, vinegar and orange juice, should not be consumed from such 
dinnerware. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiesta's manufacturer says that's good advice for any type of old dinnerware. 
"We would not recommend storing anything with a high acid content for a long 
period of time," Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a warning by New York state health authorities about the danger 
of uranium leaching from orange Fiesta ware, the FDA said in 1981 that the 
"levels of radioactive material in ceramic tableware are not considered 
hazardous." 
</P>

GARDENING; INDULGING IN EARTHLY DELIGHTS; MAGAZINE FOR BOOMERS WITH BUDDING 
DESIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MARBELLA, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it "The Big Till," a magazine for baby boomers who at this stage in life 
are going, if not totally to seed, then to bulbs and compost and all those 
other earthly delights. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the stylish new magazine is called Garden Design, and it seeks to 
put a uniquely boomer spin on the subject of gardening. If that's reminiscent 
of what Metropolitan Home did with interior design, there's a reason: Dorothy 
Kalins, who left Met Home last year when it was sold, now heads the new 
gardening bimonthly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know with myself, and I see it with my friends as well, I don't much care 
what my living room looks like anymore. I know I'm never going to get it 
right," Kalins says. "But the garden -- there's a sense of satisfaction that 
you get there that is unduplicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Demographically, Garden Design seems to be in the right place at the right 
time. The gardening bug tends to bite when people are somewhere in the vicinity 
of 40, industry analysts say, and the nation's more than 70 million baby 
boomers currently are between 30 and 50 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "This group's enthusiasm for the newly discovered outdoors is not matched by 
their expertise," says Kalins, who gives her age as "the leading edge of the 
baby boom." 
</P>
<P>
 "Baby boomers always need magazines of their own. They have a particular 
language and lifestyle and value system that they carry around with them. 
They're the best magazine audience in the world -- they're the last generation 
raised on reading, whether it's books or magazines." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the team behind Garden Design has a history of speaking to baby 
boomers. In addition to Kalins, who joined Met Home in 1981 when it was still 
Apartment Life, the principals include executives who have such publications as 
Rolling Stone, People and Martha Stewart Living in their credits. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Design uses elegant design, lush photography, a trendy approach and 
articles that are information-dense yet easily digested to attract their target 
generation. "You have to be smitten with it, but it has to have so many layers 
to make you come back," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 While the premier issue -- which sells for $5 on the newsstand and $4 by 
subscription -- has attracted upscale advertising such as Jaguar and Chivas 
Regal, some question whether the magazine is too narrowly focused on higher-end 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as if all baby boomers are affluent yuppies," says Bruce 
Butterfield, research director of the National Gardening Assn., a nonprofit 
organization based in Vermont that also publishes its own magazine, National 
Gardening. "In my view, it's the same as all those people who subscribe to 
Architectural Digest but don't live in million-dollar mansions. But it looks 
good on the coffee table." 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Design has what Butterfield calls the "dream machine" appeal of other 
upscale magazines devoted to, say, exotic travel or gourmet cooking. Meaning 
you may not travel or cook as lavishly as those portrayed on the magazines' 
pages, but you enjoy reading about or imagining such a lifestyle.

HOME APPLIANCES; COOLING IT ON WATER HEATER COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your water heater may be keeping you in more hot water than you're looking for 
when it comes to your gas or electric bill. 
</P>
<P>
 It's often hard to tell just how much it costs to heat your water, because 
most utility bills don't split out the energy consumption of specific 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 But unless you've taken steps to keep it under control, it's a safe bet that 
your household's water heating cost is sizable. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a lot of energy to convert cold water to hot water -- about 8 1/3 
BTUs to raise 1 gallon of water 1 degree Fahrenheit. So, if water reaches your 
house at 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and your dishwasher requires 140 degrees, it 
will take 666.4 BTUs to heat each gallon of water to that temperature. In all, 
it will have taken some 10,000 BTUs to heat the 15 gallons of water per load 
that the typical dishwasher uses. 
</P>
<P>
 That represents 8 cents worth of natural gas, a national average price of 62 
cents per therm, or 23 cents worth of electricity at 8 cents per kilowatt-hour 
-- if your heater is 100% efficient, which it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the best insulated electric water heater leaks heat to its surroundings, 
typically to the tune of about $65 a year. A gas heater does even worse, losing 
about one-quarter of its energy up the flue while it's heating water. 
</P>
<P>
 Saving energy on hot water calls for a two-pronged attack -- use less heat and 
less hot water by lowering the temperature or reducing the number of gallons 
used. Of the two approaches, the first is easier and can produce the greatest 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't need a lot of new equipment to use less heat. Check your water 
heater's temperature setting. You could be throwing money away by running your 
dishwasher and washing machine at excessively high temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 How hot should hot water be? A dishwasher is your most demanding user, and 
makers recommend 140 degrees Fahrenheit for best results. There's no reason to 
keep your water thermostat higher than this, and you might try a lower setting 
to see if your dishes still get clean. Savings depend on utility rates, cold 
water supply temperature and heater setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Installing inexpensive flow restrictors uses less water for showers and 
faucets. Also, make sure your hot water faucets don't leak. One drop a second 
dumps 400 gallons of expensive hot water a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Storage heat losses can be reduced about 15% by dropping the thermostat from 
140 to 130 degrees. Older water heaters can be helped by installing an 
insulation kit. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn off the water heater when you go on vacation. For less than 24 hours, 
this doesn't pay off, but for longer periods it makes a real difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Tankless, or instantaneous, water heaters eliminate storage losses except for 
warming delivery pipes each time they operate. They can maintain maximum output 
indefinitely, but there is no backlog of preheated water because there is no 
storage tank. Limited delivery rates, usually less than two gallons per minute, 
make water-saving faucets and shower heads more useful. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat-pump water heaters can be efficient but have high initial costs.

GARDENING; WEIGHING OPTIONS TO RID PLANTS OF SCALE INSECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE REICH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keep on the lookout for small, white, cottony tufts on houseplants. These 
tufts, which might appear on plants as different as gardenia and jade, are not 
some mutant flower common to plants all over the world. These white creatures 
are "scale insects." 
</P>
<P>
 Scale insects are of two types. One type, the armored scales, never have that 
cottony look and stay in place beneath a protective, waxy shield. The other 
type, which is cottony, are the naked scales, and include mealybugs and cottony 
cushion scale. The "cotton" is composed of wax filaments. 
</P>
<P>
 A scale insect eats by sticking its hollow, pointed stylet into a plant, then 
sucking up plant juice. Plants infested with scale are weakened, often to the 
point of death. 
</P>
<P>
 While feeding, the insects excrete a sweet, sticky liquid called honeydew. On 
the plant, the honeydew is food for a fungus that grows as a sooty coating on 
the plant. The fungus does no direct harm to the plant, but it is unsightly and 
can become severe enough to actually shade a plant from light. 
</P>
<P>
 Scale insects are easily kept in check, but hard to permanently eradicate. 
Using an insecticide is one recourse. Another -- often justifiable to prevent 
spread from one plant to another -- is to throw out an infested plant. At the 
very least, isolate infested plants from other plants. 
</P>
<P>
 There are less aggressive controls than chemical poisons or plant sacrifice. A 
sure but tedious method for killing scale insects is to dab them with a cotton 
swab dipped in rubbing alcohol. This method is 100% effective, as long as you 
are diligent. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot water is another way to kill these pests. Immerse the leaves and stems of 
a plant in water at 140 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit for five to 10 minutes. This 
treatment should leave the plant unharmed, but just to make sure, first test a 
single leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also evict scale insects with a stream of water. The insects are just 
barely mobile so it is unlikely that they will clamber back up the stems once 
dislodged. A dousing with soapy water is even more effective in penetrating the 
insects' waxy covering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Safer's Insecticidal Soap" is a relatively benign insecticide that is similar 
to plain soap and water. Spray it on a plant, then, after about 15 minutes, 
wash the plant off in the kitchen sink with a spray of plain water. Again, 
first test soapy water or insecticidal soap on one leaf, because either 
material can damage some plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Biological control is another possibility. The Mealybug Destroyer ladybug has 
been imported from Australia to control scale in California citrus groves. 
</P>
<P>
 If the thought of deliberately bringing insects into your home is repulsive, 
how about a fungal disease? The fungus Beauvaria globulifera is not available 
commercially, but isn't it reassuring to know that even scales have diseases to 
keep their numbers in check? 
</P>
<P>
 Diligence is needed to control scale. Although any of the above methods are 
effective against adults, eggs may be unaffected. Repeated control is needed to 
knock down each new group of hatchlings and any adults that managed to escape 
control.

GARDENING; FAMILY HOUSING FOR BUTTERFLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A successful butterfly garden must include plants that meet their needs during 
all four stages of their life cycle -- egg, caterpillar, chrysalis and adult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plants are important to butterflies during each stage of their life cycle. A 
garden designed with this in mind attracts the largest number and greatest 
variety of butterfly visitors," states a report from Callaway Gardens of 
Georgia on how to create a butterfly garden. Rule No. 1 is "locate the garden 
in a sunny area (since) butterflies and most butterfly-attracting plants 
require bright sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
 Next, choose plants with nectar-producing flowers, preferably those with 
single flowers, and try for continuous bloom throughout the growing season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Butterflies visit plants in search of nectar, a sugary fluid, to eat. Many 
native butterflies seem to prefer purple, yellow, orange and red-colored 
blossoms. Clusters of short, tubular flowers or flat-topped blossoms provide 
the ideal shapes for butterflies to easily land and feed," according to the 
Callaway experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-flower nectar is easier for them to extract than that of double-type 
flowers, which have more petals per flower. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure-fire hits for nectar sources are: 
</P>
<P>
 Shrubs: azaleas, butterfly bush (Buddleia davidii), glossy abelia (Abelia 
grandiflora) and bush and trailing lantanas ( L. camara and L. montevidensis ). 
</P>
<P>
 Annuals: cosmos, French marigold (Tagetes patula), heliotrope, impatiens, 
tithonia, zinnia, moss verbena (Verbena tenuisecta) and Egyptian star-cluster 
(Pentas lanceolata).  
</P>
<P>
 Perennials: New England aster ( A. novae-angliae ), coneflower (Echinacea 
purpurea), pineapple sage (Salvia rutilans), eupatorium, Phlox subulata, 
vervain (Verbena bonariensis) and verbena ( V. canadensis ). 
</P>
<P>
 Butterflies also need host plants, which provide food for caterpillars and 
lure the females into the garden to lay eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "After mating, female butterflies search for a specific kind of host plant on 
which to lay eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, monarchs lay eggs on milkweed, black swallowtails on parsley and 
Eastern tiger swallowtails on tulip tree or wild cherry," reports Callaway 
Gardens, in Pine Mountain, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Also recommended are damp areas or shallow puddles, so the butterflies can 
drink and extract salts from moist soil, and flat stones, which allow them to 
perch, spread their wings and bask in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about damage from the caterpillars, which emerge in a few days from 
the eggs and begin to eat? 
</P>
<P>
 "Caterpillars are selective eaters and only feed on specific kinds of plants," 
Callaway says. "If the desired plants aren't available, the caterpillars will 
starve rather than eat another type of vegetation. Usually female butterflies 
lay eggs on or near the plants their caterpillars prefer to eat. Most butterfly 
caterpillars feed on native plants and are not considered agricultural or 
ornamental pests." 
</P>
<P>
 When the caterpillars are fully grown, they shed their skin for a final time 
and change into chrysalides, which develop into the body of an adult butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 The chrysalides often are found attached to plant stems. 
</P>
<P>
 One caution: Most garden pesticides are toxic to butterflies, so "use 
predatory insects, insecticidal soap or hand-remove the pests if problems 
occur." 
</P>
<P>
 For further reading, Callaway Gardens suggests "Butterflies and Moths" by R.T. 
Mitchell and H.S. Zim (Golden Press, 1987); "The Audubon Society Handbook for 
Butterfly Watchers" by R. M. Pyle (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1984), and "The 
Butterfly Book" by Donald and Lillian Stokes and Ernest Williams (Little, Brown 
and Company, 1991).

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: SOUND A BIT TOO FAMILIAR? JUST PUT A CORK IN IT 
</P>

<P>
 Question: We live in a condo and share a common wall with a neighbor. The wall 
is thin; sound, such as music and snoring, passes through easily. Is there any 
way to soundproof the wall without spending a fortune? 
</P>
<P>
 K.F. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "To a certain degree, a texture on the wall will help," says Pete 
Gorman of Rancho Lumber in Westminster. "There are different types of textures 
that can be spread or sprayed on your walls to create an uneven surface that 
absorbs sound. However, the downside is that a textured wall may not go with 
your decor, and while it may provide some soundproofing, it may not be enough 
to make much of a difference. You could also try putting cork up or hang heavy 
rugs from the offending wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate solution would be to construct a second wall in front of the 
common wall with 1 x 2s and drywall. This creates an airspace that deadens the 
sound. While building a second wall may not be difficult or require a building 
permit, you'll probably have to check with your condo association as to whether 
it's allowed." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I understand there's a method of using a tinted glue to repair hairline 
cracks in ceramic tile that makes the cracks invisible. How is it used? 
</P>
<P>
 J.M. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 A: "There used to be a waterproof membrane product that was on the market, but 
it's not sold anymore," says Dan Richey of California Wholesale Tile in 
Anaheim. "Once you have a crack in ceramic tile, it's probably best to find out 
what's causing it. Usually it's because of movement of the surface beneath the 
tile; it could be settling, or a seam in the underlayment has come up. You'll 
have to remove the broken tiles, replace or fix them, then reinstall them." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have an interior door that continually swings halfway open rather than 
staying flat against the wall. Is there a simple remedy to this problem? 
</P>
<P>
 J.T. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A: "When this happens, it's not uncommon for the door frame or that part of 
the house to be not particularly straight," says Dave Stevens of Woodward 
Hardware in Santa Ana. "Put a level on top of the door or the frame to see if 
there's a slant. Usually, you can remedy this by putting some wood or metal 
shims between the hinges and the door until the door stays put." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When I close one of my kitchen drawers, it tips backward, which means I 
have to keep it half-open all the time. What's involved in repairing it? 
</P>
<P>
 H.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 A: "It sounds as though the drawer is lacking a center rail," says contractor 
Tom Perry of Brea. "Pull the drawer out and check the opening. The rail is made 
of wood or metal, and there's a guide on the bottom of the drawer that it 
should fit into. Most stores that carry kitchen hardware can get you a new 
metal rail, and lumber stores have the molding you'd use for a wood rail." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there anything wrong with using a smooth wall roller rather than a thick 
roller for painting an acoustic ceiling? 
</P>
<P>
 R.T. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 A: "There's nothing wrong with it; it just means you're going to be working 
harder," says house painter Dave Valdez of Costa Mesa. "A ceiling roller is 
thick and absorbent, and it's able to get paint into all areas of a textured 
area like an acoustic ceiling. When buying rollers, you may want to look where 
there is a selection of them designed for various walls or textures."

GARDENING; FLOWERING SHRUBS ARE BLOOMING SOLUTION TO LANDSCAPE WOES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whatever your landscape needs, flowering shrubs and vines can tackle the 
challenge. Whether you want to create a hedge, hide a shed or cover a trellis, 
this sampling of easy-to-grow plants can fill the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Blooming shrubs not only add beauty to your home, but they can also help solve 
your landscape problems. Many shrubs can be used as hedges or screens to block 
views or to create privacy. Grouped, shrubs can form a border that matches the 
color show of annuals and perennials. Specimen shrubs can be the star in a 
small garden or highlight a garden pool or bench. Count on shrubs for 
year-round interest. Whether shrubs are blooming, showing fall foliage, bearing 
fruit or standing bare in a wintry garden, they paint the landscape with colors 
and textures that change every season. 
</P>
<P>
 Vines are one of the most versatile garden plants because they adapt so easily 
to even the most imaginative garden design. They are breathtaking whether 
spilling out of containers, creating living walls or scaling the sides of 
buildings. Vines can cascade over walls and pergolas to create green-sheltered 
worlds and can hide a multitude of garden "sins," such as storage sheds, broken 
down fences or tree stumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking feature of the vines is their flowers, which are in colors 
as varied as a painter's palette. Many of these flowers bear scents that fill 
an entire garden with sweet aromas. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting started with shrubs and vines isn't difficult. You can find 
container-grown or bare-root shrubs and vines at a local nursery or garden 
center. All they need to provide color for years to come is a spot in your 
garden to call home.

COLLECTIBLES; BRANCHING OUT WITH BLUE WILLOW PATTERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue Willow china, the pattern that put the "blue plate special" on the menu 
at American diners, also gave rise to a host of home accessories and collectors 
who prowl flea markets and attend china swap meets looking for variations on 
what must be the most ubiquitous design ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started in the 18th Century with a transfer-printed, Chinese-inspired 
pattern with the now-familiar willow tree, footbridge, fleeing lovers and 
pagoda. The design was created in 1780 by an English potter, Thomas Turner, and 
the engraver Thomas Minton at Caughley Pottery in Shropshire, England. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, like other potters of his day, was cashing in on the popularity of 
blue and white Chinese export wares. His copies were less expensive than the 
imports and became an excellent seller. 
</P>
<P>
 What Turner started, many others continued, and Blue Willow has come to 
represent an era when life was simpler. As such, it appeared on two New Yorker 
magazine covers -- Nov. 14, 1942, and July 23, 1990 -- and on a couple of TV 
series, "Murder, She Wrote" and "The Andy Griffith Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Willow also has appeared on packaging for a variety of products such as 
coffee, mayonnaise and peanut butter. It has been impressed or etched on metal 
and glass tumblers, pierced onto lampshades, hooked into rugs, embroidered on 
samplers, woven into textiles, applied to wax candles and hand soap. It also 
has been printed on cookware, wallpaper, playing cards, greeting cards and a 
jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinnerware is the most common use of the willow pattern. "Blue plate special" 
is named for the divided plates bearing the pattern used in many family-style 
restaurants. Replacements Ltd., a china replacement service in Greensboro, 
N.C., has more than 40 willow patterns in its stock of secondhand china. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of companies issuing the pattern or a variant of it from the 18th 
Century to today numbers in the thousands," Mary Lina Berndt says. "Countries 
in which the pattern has been produced include Denmark, Germany, France, Japan, 
Thailand and, of course, the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Berndt, a collector in Arlington, Tex., writes and publishes The Willow Word, 
a bimonthly newsletter, and is historian for the International Willow 
Collectors, whose annual convention is scheduled for June 17-19 in Hyannis, 
Mass. She says that while blue and white is the most common color scheme, the 
pattern also has been made in a variety of other colors, including red, pink, 
mulberry, green, brown, gold and black. 
</P>
<P>
 The most familiar of the patterns is the one created in 1810 by Spode in 
England and known today as the traditional pattern. Its elements include a 
bridge, weeping willow, pair of lovebirds, young couple and their pursuer, 
pagoda, island, boat, fence, orange tree and inner and outer patterned borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1905, most Blue Willow available in the United States was imported from 
England. Then the Buffalo Pottery of Buffalo, N.Y., began making and marketing 
the pattern, Berndt says. A surviving company, Buffalo China Inc., still makes 
the pattern for restaurants and institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, English companies such as Royal Doulton, Wedgwood and Wood & Sons 
(called Woods ware) and others in Japan and Taiwan market willow china. And a 
host of other companies turn out novelty products bearing some variation of the 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could decorate an entire house, from floor to ceiling, in the willow 
pattern," Berndt says. 
</P>
<P>
 Among items she has seen or has featured in the newsletter are wallpaper, a 
light-switch plate, bedsheets and yard goods, a lamp and tea towels made into 
window curtains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most other collectibles have well-established parameters. We know exactly how 
many patterns there were," she says. "No matter how many different pieces of 
willow you own, there will always be still more unusual examples that you 
haven't seen."

COLLECTIBLES; OLD CHARITY RECIPE BOOKS TELL WHAT WAS COOKING IN THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Community or charity cookbooks may seem unlikely collectibles, but they are 
fascinating glimpses into the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The deliciousness in these cookbooks is the clear voices and images that 
immediately come forth as you begin to read. You feel as if you are right there 
in the room with these women -- hearing their very words. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civil War is the unlikely mother of community cookbooks. With husbands, 
fathers and brothers off fighting, women organized "sanitary" fairs to raise 
money to purchase food and medical supplies. Usually they would sell food at 
these fairs and sometimes would put together little recipe books to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The first charity cookbook documented was "A Poetical Cook-Book," produced by 
Maria J. Moss in 1864. Her book is dedicated to the sanitary fair held in 
Philadelphia that year. The early production of these books is believed to have 
been a Yankee idea, but "The Confederate Receipt Book" of Richmond, Va., 1863 
-- which offers recipes and housekeeping tips for use in times of war -- may 
have been used to raise relief funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Longone, a passionate charity cookbook collector and owner of a vast Wine 
and Food Library, an antiquarian bookshop in Ann Arbor, Mich., explains that 
when the war ended, these groups of women were so energized from being in 
charge and producing essential money that they turned their attention to 
charities, putting together books to benefit every cause imaginable, from 
aiding the mentally ill to forming temperance unions. 
</P>
<P>
 The community cookbook movement spread quickly across the country. By the end 
of the 1870s, women in more than half of the country's states had produced such 
books. Women in groups ranging from the Massachusetts' Ladies' Society to the 
Baptist Women's Group published cookbooks to benefit a range of charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some books offer only recipes, but others might offer combinations of signed 
recipes with notes from the authors, a foreword describing the mission of the 
cookbook and maybe the people who put it together, household management advice, 
etiquette and practical advice. The latter includes everything from gracious 
ways to cheer the sick to methods of combatting sleepiness in church. Reading 
between the lines of these books is essential to understanding the writers' 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 Longone notes that collectors may come across pre-1915 cookbooks in which 
recipes were written in verse -- some quite charming. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the Civil War on," Longone continues, "there was a ferment among 
American women about their roles and responsibilities. The struggle about where 
women should be is continually carried on in these books, and from different 
perspectives." 
</P>
<P>
 Collecting community cookbooks can become an engaging hunt. Longone suggests 
choosing a niche, such as cookbooks from a favorite decade or state, to give 
your collecting direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, the best place to locate these books is in used bookstores," she says. 
Longone recommends sharing your goals with a knowledgeable antiquarian book 
dealer who deals specifically in Americana or cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Once your collection is started, it's best to store the books upright in a 
case, away from heat and light. Longone cautions against pressing books too 
tightly together in a case, as the covers can stick together. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for community cookbooks can be as little as $15 and as much as $2,000, 
depending on the condition of the book and its rarity. For the most part, 
prices will hover between $75 and $150 for pre-1920 cookbooks, Longone says.

SAFETY; WHEN THE HEAT IS ON, THE KITCHEN CAN BE DANGEROUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Avoiding burns in the kitchen involves more than just having a fire 
extinguisher ready. Corky Clark, senior instructor at the Culinary Institute of 
America, in New Hyde Park, N.Y., gives tips on the best ways to protect 
yourself: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't lean too close to the oven. When checking the progress of a dish, open 
the oven door and keep your face turned away. Pull the shelf out, remove the 
dish and put it on the range top. If a recipe requires basting, take the dish 
out, baste and put it back in the oven. It takes more time and effort, but it's 
worth it for safety's sake: Oven shelves are unsteady. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep the broiler clean. Most fires in the broiler are caused by grease 
buildup. Be sure to thoroughly clean and scrape the broiler after every use. If 
you line the broiler with foil, change it every time. Baking soda and salt do 
work to extinguish very small flames, but Clark recommends using a fire 
extinguisher. If the fire is big, get out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * Point pot handles toward the middle of the stove or toward the wall. If the 
pot handle sticks out, there's a chance that you could bump into it or that a 
child could pull the pot off the stove. If a hot pot is on the counter, tie a 
piece of cloth or rag on the handle to warn people (especially children) that 
it's hot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure pot mitts are perfectly dry before using them. Moisture in the 
mitt will create steam when you grasp a pot, and you could severely burn your 
hand. Don't be cheap when it comes to mitts: Buy the thickest ones you can 
find. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't lift a pot top straight up. Tilt the lid so that the steam escapes 
away from you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always use mitts to remove dishes from the microwave because microwaved food 
transfers its heat to the container. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you get burned, run very cold tap water over the burn immediately. Don't 
put anything on it. If it's an open wound or looks serious, wrap it in plain 
gauze and see a doctor right away. 
</P>
<P>
 * Equip your kitchen with a fire extinguisher, a smoke detector and, if you 
have gas appliances, a gas detector. Keep the fire extinguisher near the oven, 
a smoke detector right outside the kitchen door and the gas detector on the 
kitchen ceiling. The gas detector will signal if the pilot light goes out or if 
the oven or a burner is slightly on. Gas detectors cost about as much as smoke 
detectors.

FRIENDS, FOES LAUD NIXON ROLE IN WORLD AFFAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton joined his predecessors and other prominent Americans Friday 
night in mourning the death of Richard Nixon, calling him a "statesman who 
sought to build a lasting structure of peace" during a "particularly difficult 
period of the Cold War." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from the White House Rose Garden two hours after Nixon's death, 
Clinton referred only briefly to the Watergate scandal that had brought an 
early end to Nixon's presidency, saying the 37th President had "experienced his 
fair share of adversity and controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, like many others who commented on the former President's passing, the 
President concentrated on Nixon's achievements in foreign affairs, saying that 
Nixon "had the wisdom to know when the time was right to reach out to the 
Soviet Union and China" and that today's world is one of "great opportunity in 
no small part because of the vision of Richard Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, he said, had been able to "leave his mark on his times as few national 
figures have done in our history" and that he continued to do so "right up to 
the end of his life." Only a month ago, he said, Nixon had sent him a private 
letter recounting his observations from a recent trip to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to be in this job without feeling a special bond with the 
people who have gone before, and I was deeply grateful to President Nixon for 
his wise counsel on so many occasions on many issues over the last year," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said Clinton planned to declare a national day of 
mourning for the former President. An announcement is expected later today. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Ronald Reagan, in a statement issued by his office in Los 
Angeles, also praised Nixon's foreign policy achievements, calling him "a great 
champion of democratic ideals who dedicated his life to the cause of world 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "To millions, Richard Nixon was truly one of the finest statesmen this world 
has ever seen," Reagan's statement said. "There's no question that the legacy 
of this complicated and fascinating man will continue to guide the forces of 
democracy forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Jimmy Carter said Nixon's "foreign policy accomplishments 
laid important groundwork for efforts of the presidents who have succeeded him. 
His foresight and diplomatic skill helped bring about much-needed detente and 
better understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Former President George Bush said: "The difficulties he encountered in office 
may have diminished his presidency, but what should be remembered are his many 
outstanding achievements both foreign and domestic." 
</P>
<P>
 And former President Gerald R. Ford, who succeeded Nixon and pardoned him for 
his Watergate actions, said the country has "lost an outstanding foreign policy 
statesman." 
</P>
<P>
 "President Nixon believed in and fought for the best traditions of America 
worldwide; we greatly admired his firm dedication to democracy at home and 
abroad," Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a former foe praised what many regard as the highlight of Nixon's 
presidency: his reopening of relations between the United States and China. "I 
think, like others, that his opening to China was a major accomplishment," said 
89-year-old Alger Hiss. "But in other respects, he left many deeds uncorrected 
and unatoned for." 
</P>
<P>
 As a young member of Congress from California in the late 1940s, Nixon led an 
investigation of allegations that Hiss, then a senior State Department 
official, had ties to Communists. The allegations, still the center of fierce 
dispute, ruined Hiss' career and catapulted Nixon into national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's fellow Republicans, in their statements, argued that his foreign 
policy achievements would outshine the Watergate scandal -- the break-in at 
Democratic National Committee headquarters during Nixon's 1972 reelection 
campaign, and the subsequent attempt to cover up Republican responsibility for 
the burglary. It was Watergate that, in 1974, made Nixon the only U.S. 
President ever to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 "All in all, people are going to look back and say Watergate, the resignation, 
a lot of these things were bad and shouldn't have happened," said Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who served as GOP chairman during part of 
Nixon's presidency. "I think history will, with a few exceptions, say that this 
man made a difference. You add all that up and he comes out ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's secretary of state, Henry A. Kissinger, praised him for having a 
combination of idealism and realism. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt idealism did not prohibit, and indeed required, an understanding of 
the world as it was," Kissinger said. "And he patiently studied the world as it 
was and then put his ideals into the service of his analysis, and that enabled 
him to be so consistent and to be so resilient." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Gov. Pete Wilson said Nixon "came to symbolize America's 
implacable opposition to communism" and "played a major role in winning the 
Cold War. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a fighter, with a fierce loyalty to the friends and causes he believed 
in," Wilson said. "I am greatly saddened by his death, but very grateful to 
have known him." Former Nixon aide Robert H. Finch, who managed his 
unsuccessful 1960 presidential campaign and then went on to serve as secretary 
of health, education and welfare during Nixon's first term, also commented on 
the strength of the former President's determination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anybody who had a greater drive or a stronger intelligence than 
Richard Nixon. He had an incredible ability to focus on a given race or a given 
issue," Finch said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, that same trait helped lead to Nixon's downfall in the 
Watergate cover-up. "He didn't have to get into it -- but he did," Finch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's first vice president, Spiro T. Agnew, who resigned in 1973 after 
revelations of his involvement in a payoff scandal as governor of Maryland, 
sent his condolences from his home in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We extend to Tricia, Julie and the other family members our sincere sympathy 
on the death of President Richard Nixon," Agnew's statement said. "Our thoughts 
and prayers are with them at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's death did not put an end to the deep polarization of the American 
people by a man who dominated the nation's politics for nearly a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Nixon did not distinguish between the nation's interest and his 
personal interest; he believed that any threat to either had to be crushed," 
said Rep. Ray Thornton (D-Ark.), who helped draft the articles of impeachment 
that the House Judiciary Committee adopted against Nixon in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was sort of weird, but to me he was a friendly sort of person," former 
House Speaker Carl Albert, a Democrat, said from his home in McAlester, Okla. 
"I never had any trouble with him." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hanoi, Vietnam, where Nixon's name stirred passions two decades ago during 
a war that he helped shape, news of the stroke that led to his death was 
greeted philosophically.  
</P>
<P>
 Tran Thi Thu, a 40-year-old woman who peddles fruit and vegetables to 
passers-by on the street, said: "He did what he had to do, just like all of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Le Ngoc Hung, 42, an employee at the Freedom Hotel, said: "Thinking back to 
the days of bombing and gunfire, his name brings back a lot of sadness. He 
caused us much hardship. We could never love him, of course. But Vietnamese are 
very respectful. We wish him peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Eric Malnic, Nora Zamichow, David Willman and Niesen 
Himmel in Los Angeles, and Lily Dizon in Hanoi, contributed to this story.

GRIEF, BLAME OVER JORGE'S SUICIDE CAN'T BE LAID TO REST; TRAGEDY: BOY'S DEATH 
REVERBERATES THROUGH COMMUNITY. LATINOS COMPLAIN OF CULTURAL INSENSITIVITY. 
</P>

<P>
 The priest stood next to the short white coffin and spoke of the "moment of 
sickness" that had stolen Jorge David Licea's life. The sickness, it was 
understood at this rosary Mass, had more than one name and symptoms that 
overlapped. Violence, guns, poverty and despair. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jorge was only 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, students arriving for classes at 49th Street Elementary School in 
South-Central Los Angeles saw him place the muzzle of his father's .380-caliber 
semiautomatic pistol to his temple, then collapse in his pooling blood. Nobody 
can understand a suicide such as this. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago when I was in Uganda, I saw children dying of starvation," 
said another priest at another Mass for Jorge in Los Angeles. "Those children 
had almost nothing. But here, where there are so many things, children are 
dying of violence. This helps us to understand so much about our society. We 
must not let this death be in vain." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Licea, a sensitive child who dreamed of becoming a policeman, was buried 
Friday in Durango, Mexico, because that country is where his immigrant parents 
feel most at home. Jorge was born in Los Angeles, where his father was 
convinced that opportunity would give Jorge a much better life than his own. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? From nearly every quarter, now come recrimination and guilt. 
A 10-year-old boy told the world, emphatically, that things were not right. His 
spectacular suicide begs the question: Is everybody a little to blame? 
</P>
<P>
 The reverberations run deep and wide. His father says he will think hard 
before ever bringing another gun into the family home. His mother says her son 
felt humiliated by the way his teacher disciplined him at school. The teacher 
says she is grieving, that she cannot talk about Jorge without breaking down in 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
 A tearful classmate recalls that when Jorge got in trouble for hitting her, he 
cried too. Another is having nightmares since his friend died. Some Latino 
parents are suddenly vocal about what they see as cultural insensitivity and a 
lack of supervision at school. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Jorge's suicide, children and teachers were sobbing and 
screaming, even throwing up. Nobody was sure at first who had been hit, or how. 
As the first waves of shock subsided, Principal Lemuel Chavis announced that 
everyone was to go about their business as usual, that April 14 would be a 
normal day at school. 
</P>
<P>
 But for 49th Street Elementary and those associated with it, normal is elusive 
still. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A picture of what took place in the days and hours leading to Jorge's death -- 
and how the boy interpreted such events -- is necessarily incomplete. His 
suicide gripped everybody who knew him in horrified surprise. There were no 
threats, no apparent depression, no big upheaval in his life. If there were 
troubles at school or at home, his seemed no worse than those of other children 
growing up in his inner-city neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other children his age, Jorge enjoyed sports and liked to watch 
television, especially cartoons and "Real Stories of the Highway Patrol." He 
was the second-oldest of four brothers, including a baby of 4 months. On the 
Sunday before his death, Jorge went with his family to an aerospace museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son swallowed his problems," said his father, Jorge Ramiro Licea Aguilar, 
a mechanic without a steady job. "This is so hard. As close as we were, he 
didn't tell me." 
</P>
<P>
 The school principal, citing fear of a lawsuit by the Licea family, said he 
will not talk about the boy or how he got along in class other than to say he 
cannot believe the school is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 He told teachers that they must not talk about it, either, and during a school 
assembly also warned the students not to talk to reporters. Like the shooting 
10 years ago in which a deranged neighbor killed two people and wounded 13 
others on the school playground, Jorge's suicide is simply called "the crisis" 
at 49th Street Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people, however, decided to talk about Jorge -- their classmate, friend, 
brother and son. They shook their heads over his death, shuddered and shed 
tears. As they stepped toward his open casket at the rosary Mass, young and old 
stared in pain at his bandaged face, tinged blue by death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope and pray that the young people will stop and think and get hold 
of themselves," said Martha Dickson, who was accompanying one of Jorge's 
friends, her 7-year-old granddaughter, Kevonia Allen, at another Mass for the 
boy. "He was just a baby. He didn't know what life was about." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge was, by all accounts, a normal kid who teachers sometimes disciplined 
for such infractions as speaking out of turn, spitting on the playground or 
playing too rough. In his backpack were notebook papers with the sentence, "I 
will obei (sic) my teacher" written in pencil 300 times. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no file on Jorge in the principal's office for serious 
disciplinary problems that, for example, would warrant a formal suspension from 
the school he had attended since kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents, however, said that in the three weeks before his death, Jorge 
brought home five notes from his teacher about misbehavior. A parent was 
required to sign each note, and then come to school. Jorge would then apologize 
to his teacher while his father -- and his classmates -- looked on, the parents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials would not comment on the parents' account, and 
directed inquiries to the principal, who likewise refused to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teachers should be more considerate," Jorge's father said. "They should 
give the children a little privacy so that the other kids don't laugh at them." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Jorge had many friends at school and in the neighborhood -- girls and 
boys, Latinos and blacks. On the school playground, they played handball 
together and another game called "suicide," which was Jorge's favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 As his friends describe the game, the child who catches the ball must make a 
run for the wall to avoid other players hitting him about the head. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his penchant for the game, according to his classmates, that offers an 
odd twist to the final hours of Jorge's life. His friends say that the day 
before the shooting, his teacher ordered Jorge to sit on a bench on the 
playground because he said "a bad word" during class. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of following the teacher's order, Jorge listened to another friend 
who said he didn't have to, that he could play the game instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teacher yelled at him, 'Why aren't you sitting on the bench?' " said a 
classmate, Evelia Vera, 10. "She told him that he was the only one who had to 
sit on the bench three times. Then after lunch, she gave him a note to take 
home to his parents. He stayed quiet for a minute, but then he started to cry. 
The only thing he said was, 'But. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the note, which Jorge never delivered to his parents, a school district 
spokesman confirmed that the teacher ordered Jorge to stay home the next day, 
then come to class the following day with one of his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Jorge and his 8-year-old brother, Ramiro, rode with their father to 
school as usual, arriving at 7:15 a.m. The two boys walked to the cafeteria, 
where Ramiro would have breakfast. But instead of staying with his younger 
brother, Ramiro said Jorge got up to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him where he was going," Ramiro said softly, his head bowed. "And he 
said he was going to see his teacher. Then he left. Later, a kid asked me if I 
knew about the boy. I said, 'What boy?' Then I went to class and I didn't find 
out what happened until real late." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the teacher and principal will not talk about the events of that day, 
it is not known whether Jorge met with his teacher -- perhaps to ask her to 
reconsider the informal suspension -- after leaving his brother in the 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 minutes later, however, a sobbing Jorge stood in front of the school, 
reached into his backpack for the gun and then pressed it to his head. Students 
who witnessed the scene say it unfolded very fast. Later, many of those 
children were isolated and offered intense psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crisis intervention is like a form of triage," said psychologist Richard 
Lieberman, one of two members of the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
suicide prevention unit, who was called to the school. "This is our worst 
nightmare come true." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after doctors removed Jorge from life support at Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center, the district attorney's office considered -- and 
then rejected -- the idea that the boy's father might be charged in connection 
with the death. 
</P>
<P>
 He had left the gun under a mattress in his bedroom, where it would presumably 
be accessible to ward off an intruder, but was also in reach of his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never told (my children) I had a gun in the house," said Licea, who said he 
bought the weapon to protect himself and his family in their home. "I had it 
for a long time. I even bought another one two months ago." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Children's Firearms Protection Act addresses only loaded guns, and 
when Jorge took the ammunition from a top dresser shelf in his parents' 
bedroom, loaded it into the gun, then stuffed it into his backpack, it seemed a 
particularly deliberate act for a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in child suicide, however, note that young people unskilled in 
communication often act impulsively when they are in emotional pain and a gun 
is in their home. They want to send a message, certainly, but they may be 
ambivalent about wanting to die. A firearm rarely allows for a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, police confiscated both weapons from the Licea home and 
neither has been returned. "I'm not planning to buy any others right now," 
Licea said. "I have to think about it a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's teacher, Carolyn Pinkney, said she is too upset by the suicide to 
discuss it. "I didn't see it coming," she told a reporter during an assembly on 
the schoolyard, then turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 By most accounts, she is a respected figure on campus. A display by the 
school's entrance featured six drawings and essays by children answering the 
question, "Who Is the Light of Your Life?" Among those chosen: Bo Jackson, 
Michael Jordan and Mrs. Pinkney. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Ana Garcia told of walking her daughter to class on the morning of the 
shooting and finding the teacher leaning against the door frame, weak from 
grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is destroyed, the teacher," Garcia said. "She was bathed in tears. She is 
an excellent teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents with children in 49th Street Elementary School have been 
thinking beyond the sadness of losing such a young life. Although no one is 
suggesting a direct link to Jorge's suicide, they say the tragedy has 
galvanized the anger they have been feeling for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 They complain of a shortage of Spanish-speaking staff members, of poor 
supervision on campus and of insensitivity to the concerns of Latino parents. 
</P>
<P>
 About 85% of the students at 49th Street Elementary are Latino and the rest 
are black. Like many schools in South-Central Los Angeles, the percentage of 
Latino students used to be far less. 
</P>
<P>
 One mother with two children at the school, who like most others asked that 
her name not be used, said: "I was a student at the school myself. It is 
nothing like the way it was. They do not send home notes in Spanish. They don't 
care about the Hispanic community." 
</P>
<P>
 Another mother said that in the aftermath of Jorge's suicide, she has been 
meeting with other Latino parents and that, as a group, they plan to send a 
letter to the school board about problems at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Liceas' attorney, Pete Navarro, said the family does not believe the 
school district is necessarily insensitive to Latinos. "They see it as a 
faceless system against poor people. It's the school district, the 
administration, and how they react toward poor immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge's parents have not decided whether they will file a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want another innocent to fall like this," his father said.

NIXON FUNERAL TO BE HELD WEDNESDAY IN YORBA LINDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When America last mourned the passing of a President more than two decades 
ago, the eyes of the world fell on the hills of Texas that Lyndon Baines 
Johnson always loved. Thousands waited in the cold wind, 21-gun salutes and 
jets overhead marked the occasion, and then-President Richard Nixon shut down 
the government to honor his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the nation plays out that scene again, it is this town's turn to take 
center stage as it buries its most prominent native son. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here, in this bedroom town of 57,000 people -- where horse-grazing laws 
often mark the fiercest political debate of the day -- that world leaders and 
neighbors alike will gather next week to mark the passing of Nixon at the age 
of 81. He died Friday night in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is often the focus of much of the national mourning that follows 
the death of a President -- but not this time. Because Nixon had asked that he 
not lie in state in the Capitol, the library that bears his name will instead 
assume that high-profile role. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace announced Friday night 
that members of the public will be invited to gather at the library beginning 
at 1 p.m. Tuesday to await the arrival of the motorcade bearing his body. Nixon 
will lie in state at the library for public viewing from 3 p.m. that day 
through the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 p.m. Wednesday, with family and friends in attendance, the library will 
hold funeral services, with Dr. Billy Graham as officiant. President Bill 
Clinton, Gov. Pete Wilson and Sen. Robert Dole will deliver the eulogies. 
</P>
<P>
 A private burial will follow at the library, near the resting place of Nixon's 
wife, Pat, who died last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the public are invited to send flowers to the library at 18001 
Yorba Linda Blvd., Yorba Linda, Calif. 92686. Except for the public viewings, 
the library will be closed through Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of world dignitaries and other key questions in the funeral planning 
remained uncertain Friday night, but one thing seems certain: as much as 
Nixon's family and friends intend to maintain a private air to the funeral 
ceremonies, the city of his birthplace will now become the focus of the most 
attention in its quiet history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is totally ready," Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley said. "We've been 
prepared for days, quite frankly." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley predicted a stately affair in a city that has come to regard the 37th 
president with a special affection, even after his fall from national favor in 
the wake of Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the hometown. We will tend to his memory," she said. "Orange County is 
of course the bastion of Republicanism, and the respect that will turn out for 
President Nixon will be overwhelming, there's no doubt. We welcome them and we 
have open arms for anyone who wishes to pay their respects. He'll always be the 
President to us." 
</P>
<P>
 In a placid town where many of the churches and downtown buildings from 
Nixon's birth 81 years ago still stand today, next week's event offer a 
potentially daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the opening of the Nixon library in 1990, the town has played host to 
world leaders several times already, most recently for Pat Nixon's funeral last 
year. But her husband's funeral and burial could bring the town the most 
attention of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Security will prove a key concern in the days ahead, as the Secret Service and 
other federal agencies converge on Yorba Linda to ensure a smooth event. 
Officials with the Orange County Sheriff's Department and the Brea Police 
Department, which patrols Yorba Linda, say they will also begin planning 
security measures to prepare for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect the next few days will be days that the eyes of the world will 
focus on Orange County to perhaps unprecedented levels," said Orange County 
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose district includes Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very, very significant event and our goal as a county should be to pay 
our deep respects, to provide a warm welcome to leaders in this country and 
probably leaders from around the world who will join in paying respects to the 
President," he said. "I am very glad that he'll be coming home to be placed at 
rest where it all began." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley echoed Vasquez's 
remarks, saying that he expects "a well-attended service." 
</P>
<P>
 One key focus, Riley said, will be maintaining the dignity of the event and 
avoiding any "extracurricular activities" that may detract from the private 
mourning of Nixon's family and friends. "That's the way it should be," he said.

HERNANDEZES BOTH GET PRISON FOR FRAUD; TRIAL: MISSION VIEJO HIGH ROLLERS APPEAL 
FOR LENIENCY BEFORE HE IS SENTENCED TO 71 MONTHS AND SHE TO 16. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Danny and Susie Hernandez, the Mission Viejo society couple who illegally 
amassed a $9-million fortune and flaunted a lifestyle that became the talk of 
Orange County, were each sentenced to prison terms Friday for their roles in a 
scheme to skim precious metals. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Hernandez received a 71-month sentence, much less than prosecutors 
wanted. But his wife, Susie, who had sought to serve her sentence at home under 
a monitoring program, was given 16 months in federal prison and must surrender 
to authorities a month from today.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry," said a pale and weeping Danny Hernandez as he kissed his wife 
goodby inside the Santa Ana courtroom after the sentences were pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hernandezes addressed the court separately, appealing for leniency. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking first, Danny Hernandez told U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler 
that "no amount of money is worth spending a day in jail for, and crime doesn't 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
 He apologized to his friends and family, especially to his children, ages 5 
and 7, for his actions. "I hope Amanda and Nicholas can forgive their dad for 
not being the role model I should have been and for me not being with them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, meanwhile, pleaded with Stotler not to separate her from her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need my children as much as they need me and their father," she said, 
barely able to speak between sobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had sought at least 10 years for Danny Hernandez, who pleaded 
guilty to mail fraud and money laundering in a complex scheme to steal precious 
metals from the company where he worked and divert them to bank accounts he and 
his wife controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stotler gave him credit for making a "significant contribution" in 
cooperating with the government to help investigators bring criminal charges 
against his old company, and the judge said she believed he had taken full 
responsibility for his crimes. With good behavior, Hernandez is eligible to 
have nine months trimmed off his six-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The government was less certain going into the hearing, however, that Susie 
Hernandez would receive any prison time because of her lesser role in the 
crimes. She had pleaded guilty to two counts of income-tax evasion. Stotler 
said Susie Hernandez probably knew "there was a criminal scheme underfoot" and 
the fact she has young children "should not carry the day." 
</P>
<P>
 During a wild six-year spending spree that relied heavily on criminal profits, 
the government alleged, the couple spent freely on an $800,000 house in Mission 
Viejo, a $1-million house in Laguna Niguel, annual excursions to Paris and 
Milan, $400,000 worth of Neiman Marcus jewelry, a $30,000 country club 
membership, and a string of 15 luxury automobiles, including five 
Mercedes-Benzes and and three Rolls-Royces. 
</P>
<P>
 Their arrests in February, 1993, surprised their social set in Newport Beach, 
who knew the Hernandezes for their frequent charitable contributions and 
fund-raisers for countless worthy causes. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators from the IRS, tipped to their flashy spending by "someone in 
the community," scrutinized their tax returns and discovered that while they 
were reporting about $410,000 in income from 1985 to 1990, they had illegally 
gained some $7 million between 1987 and 1990 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1985, listing assets of 
$188,440 and liabilities of $251,764. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Hernandez had been an 11-year employee at PGP Industries, a precious 
metals company in Santa Fe Springs. He was fired in late 1992 when it was 
discovered that he had transferred precious metals between legitimate company 
clients, arranged for PGP to buy the transferred metals, and then had PGP issue 
a check or make a wire transfer into the customer's account. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Susie Hernandez who controlled the accounts and siphoned the money 
from the company, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following their arrests, the couple was able to post bond. 
</P>
<P>
 But the couple continued to spend money, and Danny Hernandez, in particular, 
displayed a cocky and confident attitude, boasting that he might never serve 
jail time. One of his few regrets, he said, was that he might have hidden the 
money better. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times one month after his arrest, Hernandez said he 
was entitled to the money, describing it as a kind of commission for a job well 
done. He also said that top PGP company officials were well aware of his scheme 
and condoned stealing from customers, considering the skimming part of the 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I did was not wrong," he said at that time. "That was my percentage that 
I stole. . . . I was one hell of a good employee for my company. I did my job 
as well as you do yours. Do I feel guilty? Maybe in retrospect I do. But if 
they hadn't given me a piece of the money for myself, it would have gone into 
someone else's pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 PGP officials have steadfastly denied the allegations, but federal officials 
have been investigating the claims to determine any criminal wrongdoing by the 
firm. And last month, a Salt Lake City manufacturer of explosives and 
detonators alleged in a civil lawsuit that PGP and its parent company, Gerald 
Metals Inc., committed fraud by taking $1.5 million of the company's precious 
metals over a span of eight years. The lawsuit was detailed last week in the 
Advocate, a Stamford, Conn., newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's arrest did not keep them from embarking on a course to hide or 
dispose of their assets or continuing to spend money, government authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a month after his arrest, Danny Hernandez put $80,000 into an 
escrow account to buy actor Richard Gere's $1.5-million home. 
</P>
<P>
 While declaring that all of her assets had been turned over to the government, 
including $315,000 worth of jewelry, Susie Hernandez tried to sell some of her 
jewelry back to Neiman Marcus at Fashion Island Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Neiman Marcus would not buy back the jewelry, Susie Hernandez admitted 
before FBI agents and during a lie detector test that she sold a $30,000 
diamond Parve bracelet for $12,500 and a $30,000 matching pair of earrings sold 
for $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
 And two months after their arrest, while Susie Hernandez was pleading poverty 
and requested a federal public defender, her husband took off to see the Final 
Four basketball tournament in New Orleans because a favorite team was playing. 
When his commercial flight arrived late in Denver, he chartered a jet to take 
him and others the rest of the way, paying $5,000 in cash and charging the 
remainder of $2,800 on a credit card. The trips violated his bail agreement, 
which limited his travel to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he visited the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, paying $880 for 
his room and expenses. In June, he and his wife had a $3,000 reconciliation 
weekend in Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Still driving a Mercedes-Benz and escorting his children to a private school, 
neighbors complained that he was living better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But last September, Stotler placed Hernandez under house arrest and made him 
wear an electronic bracelet after learning of his travels. When he fell $400 
behind in payments for the cost of the monitoring system last Thanksgiving, he 
was sent to federal prison in Los Angeles. He made a plea in January to be 
returned to home surveillance, but Stotler denied his bid, calling his 
assertion that he could not pay for the home detention "flagrant and foolish." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had become so desperate for money in recent months that Susie 
Hernandez began selling the palm trees and shrubbery from their Mission Viejo 
property to local landscapers at the time they were being evicted. The bank 
that owned the home has foreclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers filed before sentencing, Susie Hernandez said she had been 
duped by her husband, who told her that PGP was allowing him to invest in 
precious metals outside the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never told me he was embezzling from the company," she said. "As our 
income began to increase, my husband told me that his investments were doing 
very well and that the company was now providing him with a compensation 
package which included bonuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Hernandez said she did not learn that her husband was involved in 
illegal activity until just before their arrests, although she did know that he 
was under an IRS investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 She admitted to selling jewelry but said it was done before the government 
requested a list of the couple's assets last September. 
</P>
<P>
 In court on Friday, Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen Wolfe rejected Susie 
Hernandez's arguments, saying she played a larger role in the skimming scheme 
than she has acknowledged by having the illegal proceeds deposited into bank 
accounts in her name. 
</P>
<P>
 "She looks good only in relation to her co-defendant," Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Hernandez's attorney, James T. Duff, maintained that Hernandez had 
contributed heavily to the government's investigation of PGP and that his work 
might help officials recover $100 million to $150 million. But Wolfe minimized 
Hernandez's role in the investigation, saying his "usefulness is all but nil" 
because of his pattern of deception. 
</P>
<P>
 "If charges are able to be brought, we cannot offer this defendant to a jury 
as a credible person to be believed," Wolfe said. "If a case is brought, it 
will be in spite of this defendant." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Hernandez asked that he spend his prison time at a minimum-security 
prison in Boron in Kern County, while Susie asked that she serve her sentence 
at a women's facility in either San Diego or Arizona. State officials are 
considering the requests. Hernandez Case Chronology

O.C. GRIEVES THE LOSS OF A HOMETOWN HERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

<P>
 Old friends recalled the handwritten notes he sent when their children were 
born or got married. Admirers marveled how, even in his 80s, he could speak at 
length, without notes, on foreign policy. Some who had never met him stood in 
silence as flags were lowered to half-staff at his birthplace -- soon to be his 
final resting place. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County reacted with profound sadness Friday night as residents learned 
of the death of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the United States, to many 
a hometown hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're losing a great statesman that knew the international scene better than 
anyone," agreed developer Gus Owen, a member of the conservative Republican 
Lincoln Club. "I'm very fond of the man and what he's done for our nation as a 
whole and what he's done for the free world. He's going to go down in history 
as one of our greatest Presidents, I have no question about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Fuentes has spent his whole life in politics, and Richard Nixon has 
always been there. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes walked his first precinct at age 12, passing out 'Nixon Now' buttons 
in the 1960 presidential election. He met Nixon face to face two years later at 
the Orange County fairgrounds. Now head of the county's Republican Party, he 
last saw Nixon three months ago, at a celebration of the 25th anniversary of 
his inaugural in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very difficult to think of our party and our country's politics without 
him," Fuentes said. "There will be a hollowness, a vacuum, a void created by 
his absence that I don't know, really, who will be able to fix or replace. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an Orange Countian, we lose a neighbor. He is, always has been, one of us. 
That makes it very hard in a special way." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon is special to the residents of Orange County because he was born here, 
in a clapboard house in Yorba Linda. Because after his resignation he lived 
here, in a bluff-top San Clemente estate. And because now he will be buried 
here, beside his wife, Pat, at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace -- soon 
to become his final resting place. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere did he have more support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's a tragedy to almost every person in San Clemente," said Dorothy 
Fuller, president of that city's historical society and author of an 
unpublished book about his years there. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after news of his death was announced in New York, about 150 people 
flocked to Yorba Linda, where they gathered at the library that serves as a 
monument to Nixon's long political career. 
</P>
<P>
 They placed red and pink carnations at the foot of the door and milled around 
the steps as a row of California and American flags flew overhead. At 9 p.m., a 
Marine honor guard lowered the flags to half-staff, as a bugler played taps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was one of the greatest Presidents we've ever had," said Yorba 
Linda resident Jack Reinhardt, 52. "I just wanted to be here to pay my 
respects." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Haupert brought his 1-year-old daughter, Lauren, to witness history. 
Nixon "was a great President," he said. "Presidents have come to him for help. 
Obviously, he's a lot smarter than people thought when he was in office." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the county Friday night, there was acknowledgment that a major 
player on the world stage was gone, a man of accomplishment and controversy 
who, for good and bad, left an undeniable mark on American history. 
</P>
<P>
 "He serves as an inspiration to everybody to stay in the game," said William 
Buck Johns, a real estate developer and Republican heavyweight. "The man has 
probably made as profound a mark on our society as any individual of the modern 
era." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon also left a personal stamp on local politics, forever signing books to 
be auctioned at party benefits, or appearing at political fund-raisers. From 
1977 to 1984, while La Habra resident Lois Lundberg chaired Orange County's 
Republican Party, Nixon raised about $1 million at four events, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in recent years, from his home in New Jersey, Nixon kept an eye on local 
politics, calling to gossip about who was running for what post, his friends 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes said he has always taken pride in welcoming guests to Orange County, 
the home of John Wayne Airport, the Ronald Reagan federal courthouse and the 
Richard Nixon presidential library. "Those names say what we are as a 
community, what is our history, our being, our philosophy, our sensibilities," 
he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the country, memories of Nixon are entwined with Watergate, the 
third-rate burglary at a Washington hotel that ultimately caused his political 
downfall. But it's different in Orange County, where Lundberg called Watergate 
"a whole lot of fuss about not very much. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started so many, many of the great things that have happened in this 
century," she said. "Most of the people who find Watergate so terrible didn't 
know him, didn't appreciate him and probably would have found something else 
that they didn't like him for (if it hadn't happened)." 
</P>
<P>
 As she mourned Friday, State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) said of 
Watergate: "There's no question it was a mistake, but people had to admire, 
ultimately, his ability to come back. It's rare you find that sort of stamina." 
</P>
<P>
 For Placentia resident John Klewer, 40, though, "Watergate cast a real shadow 
over the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm as serious a conservative as anyone," he said, "but I think at times he 
was a sore loser. . . . I wouldn't call him one of the greatest Presidents, by 
any means." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Watergate, Johns said, Nixon leaves a positive legacy of journalists 
investigating corruption in politics at the highest levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did make some very grave mistakes," Johns admitted. "His participation in 
the so-called cover-up was a very unfortunate set of circumstances. He was 
judged very harshly for those. I think that sets another standard. The press 
has an obligation . . . not to wink at the activities and indiscretions of 
those in high office." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Watergate overshadowed many of Nixon's accomplishments, his 
supporters in Orange County say it should not so mar his memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Nixon will be remembered not as the man who left the White House in 
disgrace, but as the one who re-established relations with China, opened the 
first period of detente with the Soviet Union and, essentially, started the end 
of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was amazing was his ability to almost have telescopic vision into the 
next century," said Ken Khachigian, a San Clemente political consultant who 
spent a decade on Nixon's personal staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point we'll have generations of people who are not bearing the 
baggage of scandal, or Watergate, or whether he was guilty of this, or guilty 
of that. We'll see him in a broader perspective," Khachigian said Friday. 
"Eventually, I think he will have been seen to have this vision, the ability to 
project Americans' interest into a different time frame. He did so because of 
his extraordinary conception and knowledge about the cultures and the people 
and the geopolitics of the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 For Khachigian and other local politicos, Nixon's death brings not only the 
end of an era, but the passing of a dear friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Karcher, founder of Carl's Jr., laughed as he recalled Nixon's insistence 
that his first name was spelled with a 'K' -- and the resulting misspellings on 
several autographed books. Lundberg spent the four days since Nixon's massive 
stroke Monday sorting through piles of pictures and notes she had collected 
from the President through the years. Khachigian recalled his phone chat with 
Nixon last Christmas when, as usual, they talked shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't talk about China's role in the world or what the next policy should 
be in the world or whatever -- he could talk to Henry about that," Khachigian 
said, a smile in his sad voice. "With me the talk would be California politics, 
presidential politics. He just always brought such a range of insight and a 
yearning for information about what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Orange County Republican activists saw him in January at the library in 
Yorba Linda, where they celebrated the 25th anniversary of his inaugural. Six 
months earlier, they had also gathered at the library to bury his wife, Pat, 
who died last June after a battle with lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday they will once again return to the library -- along with national 
and world leaders -- for Richard Nixon's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a display at the Nixon library of covers of Time magazine. It is just 
awesome how many weeks through the years Richard Nixon's face has appeared on 
the front of Time magazine. It's a whole wall. It just goes on and on," said 
Fuentes, who spent Nixon's last day alive at the library listening to former 
First Lady Barbara Bush speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been so much a part of our world, our life, our community of 
thinking," Fuentes continued. "It's going to be tough not looking forward to 
the next book by Richard Nixon, the next world trip and public statement, the 
next commentary, the next interview . . . we have lost a leader of magnificent 
proportion."

LANDLORDS WAIT IN VAIN AFTER QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day after the Jan. 17 quake crumpled the walls of their ground-floor 
Sherman Oaks apartment, Jim Currah and his fiancee, Gloria Villa, had found a 
new home: a roomy, second-story apartment in Glendale, nearly 20 miles from the 
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple never considered the vacant apartments that had withstood the quake 
in their old neighborhood, a quiet tree-lined enclave of luxury buildings with 
heated pools, weight rooms and saunas. "We wanted to get as far away as 
possible," said Villa, a student at Southwestern University School of Law. 
"We'd go back to New York if we could." 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months since the Northridge quake, many people have followed in 
the couple's footsteps, leaving familiar neighborhoods in a search for stable 
ground. City records and apartment managers indicate that the apartment vacancy 
rate in the San Fernando Valley has changed little since the quake, although 
damage to more than 11,000 apartments forced thousands from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The march from quake-damaged neighborhoods has been strong enough to affect 
rents. Close to the epicenter, in Northridge, Van Nuys and Reseda, rents are 
stuck at pre-quake lows and some landlords are dangling such apartment-warming 
gifts as microwaves and other incentives to attract reluctant tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Conejo Valley communities along the western leg of the Ventura Freeway, 
landlords report that quake victims have snapped up vacant apartments and rents 
are rising for the first time in years, by at least 5% in some cases, more than 
the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are coming from Chatsworth, Northridge, all over," said Michael Sigona, 
manager of a Westlake Village apartment building. "They're beating our doors 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, where nearly 60% of the population are renters, apartments are 
the bedrock of community. The Northridge quake did not simply wreck big chunks 
of residential real estate in Los Angeles and Santa Monica, but neighborhoods 
where people lived, shopped and worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "A city isn't made up of buildings, it is made up of people," said Mayor Judy 
Abdo of Santa Monica, which lost 1,500 apartments, or 5% of all apartments in 
the city. "People are our most precious resource and because of the quake they 
are not able to live here. That is devastating to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Although vacancy rates for Santa Monica are unavailable, officials say the 
city did not have enough empty apartments to house people displaced in the 
quake. Tony Trendacosta, general counsel to the rent control board, said many 
people were forced to moved outside the community, relocating in the South Bay 
or in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that many of the units were affordable, Abdo expressed concern that the 
rebuilt units will be beyond the means of displaced renters. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the apartment damage was concentrated in two areas. In Central 
Los Angeles, people were forced from 3,268 yellow- or red-tagged apartments, 
less than 1% of that area's apartment housing. In the Valley, vacated yellow- 
and red-tagged apartments accounted for 5.3% of apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst tragedy of the quake occurred when the top floors of the Northridge 
Meadows apartment building collapsed, killing 16 people who had lived on the 
first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much destruction in the area, Valley landlords anticipated a tighter 
rental market. But they now say they underestimated the fear that has caused 
many quake victims to scatter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot imagine how frightening it is," said Villa, who was thrown from 
bed by the pre-dawn earthquake in a shower of ceiling plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Her former neighbors at the apartment building on Natick Avenue, among the 
hardest hit in the city, have gone in different directions. An 82-year-old 
woman has moved in with her daughter in Tarzana. A 79-year-old woman is living 
at an Encino retirement home. Tim Gross, a 29-year-old keyboard musician, has 
moved to Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get out of there," said Gross, who commutes to gigs in the Valley 
twice a week. "I have a friend who still lives in the Valley. He's going into 
therapy; he can't take it with all the shaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Among building managers, tales of panicked tenants are legion. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen tenants fleeing a Northridge building for Simi Valley, Long Beach 
and Las Vegas in the first weeks after the quake abandoned an assortment of 
sofas, refrigerators, dishes and clothing that apartment manager Matt Mattison 
eventually tossed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took what they could and didn't come back for the rest," Mattison said. 
"They said, 'Here's my keys, here's my garage opener, I'm outta here.' All 
logic was dismissed." 
</P>
<P>
 Corea said tenants fled the third floor of a three-story apartment building 
her company owns and manages in Van Nuys. They preferred to camp in a park 
rather than rock three stories off the ground, she said. They haven't returned 
to the building, she said, although a city inspector declared it structurally 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inexplicable in some ways," said Bruce Indermall, manager of several 
buildings in the Valley. "These buildings are not red-tagged, they are not 
yellow-tagged, and they have high vacancy factors. The biggest surprise . . . 
is how much fear there is. I am not sure it is an easy situation to resolve." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics collected by the Department of Water and Power give an indication 
of post-quake apartment vacancies. One week before the quake, the DWP reported 
19,000 vacant apartments in the Valley, a vacancy rate of 9.3%. By April, 
vacancies had risen to 30,615 or 14.9% of available apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are imprecise because it appears that many badly damaged apartment 
units were counted as vacant even though they were uninhabitable. Nonetheless, 
experts say, the big rise in recorded vacancies indicates that many thousands 
of displaced tenants have not taken new apartments in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my sense that anyone who has the ability to leave the Valley is doing 
so," said Robert Starkman of the real estate consulting firm of Kenneth 
Leventhol & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with community activists and apartment managers, it is apparent 
that not all renters who leave are doing so by choice. City officials say the 
quake destroyed a big chunk of affordable housing; the average monthly rent for 
a two-bedroom unit was a manageable $640. Displaced quake victims on tight 
budgets face a difficult search. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of people still looking for affordable apartments could be sizable: 
15,000 certificates issued to quake victims for government-subsidized housing 
have not been used, and officials don't know why. They speculate that some 
landlords are reluctant to join the government program and some quake victims 
are unable to find suitable apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Affordability is not the only issue among displaced renters. Trauma caused by 
the quake has inspired requirements of apartment style and location that are 
sometimes difficult to fill. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Martinez, 38, knew what she wanted when her second-story Canoga Park 
apartment was demolished: a ground-floor apartment, private entry, plus an 
affordable rent. Martinez said she broke a rib tumbling down stairs in the 
quake; she wanted an apartment that would be easy to get out of. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, after checking nearly two dozen apartments, she chose a 
two-story, townhouse-style unit in Canoga Park.  
</P>
<P>
 How long it will take renters to resettle has become one of the great guessing 
games in local real estate. Many believe the answer has much to do with how 
long it takes to repair the damage, a constant reminder to tenants of the 
scariest seconds of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, city officials say wrecked apartment buildings lining Villa's and 
Currah's former block on Natick Avenue -- and other blocks in the city -- stand 
as open invitations to vandals and squatters whose presence is likely to drive 
tenants away. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the two-block Northridge neighborhood bordered by Roscoe Boulevard, 
Schoenborn Street, and Lindley and Zelzah avenues. One-quarter of the buildings 
are seriously damaged. Suspected gang members have turned one vacated building 
into a hangout although the owners have boarded up doors and windows to keep 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Carrasco of the city housing department said residents on the street 
have already left, some moving in with relatives, other returning to their 
native Mexico. Others have simply disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from police and city housing officials, the struggling neighborhood 
had been improving before the quake; in a cooperative spirit, landlords had 
pitched in to improve street lighting.  
</P>
<P>
 "The quake has kind of tipped it over," Carrasco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are considerable pressures to rebuild quickly, history suggests 
the process will be slow. A UC Berkeley study found that less than half of 
damaged apartments were rebuilt four years after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. A 
lack of financing and inadequate insurance were major reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said apartment owners in Los Angeles face similar economic 
obstacles. Few are adequately insured. Three years of recession, marked by 
factory shutdowns and layoffs, have conspired to drive rents down. Apartment 
vacancies throughout Los Angeles have risen as hard economic times forced grown 
children to move in with parents. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the property consulting and investment firm of Marcus & 
Millichap, apartment buildings citywide have lost half their value since the 
market peaked in 1989. Most of the 200 apartment building sales last year 
involved a financial institution unloading a property it had foreclosed on. 
</P>
<P>
 Few investors who purchased apartments in the 1980s can borrow against them to 
fund quake repairs. That is because debt owed on those properties exceeds their 
resale value. Gary W. Squier, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of 
Housing, estimates that 20% of seriously damaged apartments will not be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard times are affecting tenants' decisions also. For Stephanie Wheeler, 26 -- 
aspiring screenwriter, Hollywood gofer and real estate school pupil -- the 
quake was the last of a series of insults suffered in recessionary Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had something going for me, I'd stay," Wheeler said, emptying the 
contents of her Sherman Oaks apartment into a rented van three weeks ago in 
preparation for the trip home to Ft. Myers, Fla. "I was planning sell real 
estate in this neighborhood, but well, it looks like the earthquake wiped that 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 With rebuilding years away, landlords with apartments that withstood the quake 
are relying on time-honored tactics to attract and keep tenants: a month's free 
rent, free credit checks, breaks on security deposits. One Van Nuys landlord is 
offering a free microwave to people who sign a year's lease. Another landlord 
in Van Nuys is giving tenants engineering reports that declare the building 
structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Some landlords report their methods are working, as tenants such as Marita 
Dannes return. Forced to move when her apartment building was red-tagged, 
Dannes first went to Orange County to stay with family and friends. When she 
couldn't find an affordable apartment in Brentwood or Beverly Hills, she moved 
into an apartment eight blocks from her old one in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannes said her new place has great freeway access and a nice view, but lacks 
the heated pool and workout room she enjoyed at her old apartment. The 
amenities are less important than a building that appears stable. "I can always 
go to the gym," she said. Tallying the Damage 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake damage to apartment buildings in Los Angeles was nearly four times 
greater in the San Fernando Valley than in Central Los Angeles. In Central Los 
Angels, 3,268 apartments in 337 buildings were vacated. In the Valley, 11,028 
apartments in 507 buildings were vacated. The repair tab in the Valley is 
estimated at $330 million, more than eight times the cost of fixing damage in 
Central Los Angeles. The map shows distribution of yellow- and red-tagged 
apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Red tag: Unsafe for occupancy 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow tag: Limited entry permited

VENTURA BLVD. FACES A LONG ROAD BACK; PLANNING: WIDENING DISPUTE ILLUMINATES 
DECLINE OF VALLEY'S 'MAIN STREET.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shoppers no longer compare this stretch of Ventura Boulevard to the hip 
environs of Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder. What five years ago was a bustling, neon-splashed promenade is now 
a half-deserted row of broken, empty buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 While the recession and the Northridge earthquake have dealt the neighborhood 
cruel blows, they are not totally to blame. A slew of more complex and subtle 
forces have converged gradually over the past several years to help suck the 
area into a whirlpool of decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulevard decision-makers face issues involving parking, street widening, 
sidewalk improvements and building renovations -- which, by themselves, seem 
straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, however, they create an almost unmanageable morass of 
competing ideas that, if left unresolved, bodes ill for the boulevard's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that social trends difficult to define, let alone solve -- such as a 
fickle public abandoning one trendy hot spot for the next. 
</P>
<P>
 A citizens group charged with carrying out a long-term blueprint for growth is 
trying to sift through the problems of this 18-mile street that spans the San 
Fernando Valley from Studio City to Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 At a raucous meeting earlier this week, it became apparent that every issue -- 
no matter how simple -- gets tangled with every other. And about the only point 
of agreement seems the recognition that sorting out the mess and reviving the 
boulevard will be a big job. 
</P>
<P>
 As the debates raged around the conference table, one person attending the 
meeting expressed the frustration felt by many. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he said, "it's like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants and city officials are working to make this stretch of the boulevard 
an attractive destination again -- to replicate the buzz now surrounding the 
Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica and Old Town in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is more than just civic pride. Most people acknowledge that the 
street serves as an economic lifeline for the Valley. If Ventura Boulevard is 
healthy, the San Fernando Valley is healthy. Its shops generate millions of 
dollars every year in jobs and taxes. And its evolution affects not only 
merchants but residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens committee's discussion this week, for example, focused on whether 
to widen a stretch of Ventura, west of Van Nuys Boulevard, to add another 
left-turn lane. The city required the widening by developers of the La Reina 
Fashion Plaza to accommodate traffic created by new shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 That was eight years ago. The money to do the road work has remained in an 
escrow account while city officials and local residents argue over the project. 
In the meantime, La Reina operates under temporary permits until it can 
complete the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineer Allyn Rifkin of the Department of Transportation suggested several 
plans that would widen the north side of the boulevard. The widening would also 
take a 5-foot bite out of the street's 15-foot-wide sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Jeff Kalban, who is trying to encourage pedestrians and beautify the 
neighborhood with decorative street lamps and benches, said the change would 
destroy the small-town flavor of the strip.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're ruining an already ugly environment," Kalban said. "If you take away 5 
feet of sidewalk, you have nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
 Shopkeepers also complained that making the sidewalk narrower would drive away 
customers. One property owner who already has two vacant shops said a third 
tenant has said he too will leave if the street is widened. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, merchants and residents recognize they will also suffer if 
it is difficult to drive through the business district. And if the shops along 
the strip begin to fail, most agree it is only a matter of time until the 
larger community suffers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate is meant to be guided by the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan, a 
city blueprint for development over the next 20 years. The plan is supposed to 
encourage more people to walk along the street as well as remedy its notorious 
traffic snarls. 
</P>
<P>
 But not even a blueprint can easily settle matters on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three widening plans presented by transportation officials, two would 
take away parking spaces from merchants, who already face stiff requirements 
under the boulevard's Specific Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Without enough parking, new businesses cannot open. And there are few places 
to put new parking because Ventura Boulevard is lined on both sides by pricey 
residential real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of parking is a factor often cited in the decline of Westwood. And 
popular areas such as the Third Street Promenade and Old Town Pasadena have 
more accessible parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the La Reina center is struggling to keep its two major tenants, 
The Gap and Banana Republic clothing stores, both of which were damaged in the 
quake. Sources say the retailers -- which are owned by the same company -- are 
reluctant to return to the center.  
</P>
<P>
 Gap executives and La Reina management declined to talk about the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of the two stores on the boulevard is important to local 
merchants because they draw shoppers from throughout the Valley. The Banana 
Republic store, for instance, was the only one of the chain's outlets in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants figure that if shoppers come to the neighborhood to visit Banana 
Republic, they are likely to stroll about and drop in at smaller shops such as 
the Handmade crafts gallery and the Bead Club jewelry store. 
</P>
<P>
 Another blow to merchants would be the departure of Waldenbooks, which is 
trying to sublease its space because of sluggish business. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at two other popular boulevard stops, the Johnny Rockets hamburger 
joint and the Sharper Image boutique, have said they will return to their 
Vesper Street corner as soon as the landlord finishes repairing the building. 
</P>
<P>
 But some small-store owners say they cannot wait that long. Already, some 
owners of quake-damaged buildings have sold out for dimes on the dollar, 
leaving crumbling, empty buildings in the heart of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rents along the boulevard in Sherman Oaks have dropped so far in recent years 
-- from $3 a square foot in some places to $1 -- that some landlords are 
unwilling or unable to make repairs necessary to attract new tenants or keep 
existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many of the buildings are more than 40 years old, making them 
unattractive to prospective tenants. Even before the quake, newer facilities 
with modern utilities and ample parking were renting for the same price in 
other parts of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike the architectural flair that defines Old Town Pasadena, most of 
Ventura Boulevard through Sherman Oaks is lined with nondescript, single-story 
boxes punctuated here and there by glass-faced office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some planners and urban designers question whether Sherman Oaks will ever 
recover the allure it held during the 1980s. The nature of trendy areas, they 
say, is that they often wither as quickly as they blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Third Street 10 years from now might be empty," said planning consultant 
Woodie Tescher.

 ALL-STARS: With March Madness just a memory, it's time for our annual look at 
Valley all-stars in boys' and girls' basketball. And what a season it was. It 
had everything. . . . There was the courage of Crescenta Valley Coach John 
Goffredo, who, mourning his wife, took his team to the finals. And the 
character of Alemany High's Samantha Rigley, who always came through in the 
clutch (C17, C18). 
</P>
<P>
 FOR THE BIRDS: We don't know exactly how business is doing at the Valencia 
Jeep Eagle dealership, but it certainly meets the needs of a few birds. The 
showroom was hit in the quake and requires repair. But it will wait because a 
pair of sparrows are building a nest at the wrong spot. . . . "We didn't want 
to destroy somebody's home," the sales manager said (B11). 
</P>
<P>
 DEDICATED: Modern technology has allowed many people to work from home. Just 
give them a fax and computer, and leave them alone. Well, believe it or not, 
you can work from your hospital bed too. Just ask Gary Becker (above). The 
Agoura businessman brought his communication toys to Valley Presbyterian while 
recovering from a motorcycle accident (B4). 
</P>
<P>
 FREEBIES: Commuting around here is a royal pain in the . . . well, you know 
where. But for some Antelope Valley commuters next week, at least the pain 
won't be in the pocketbook. Transit officials will offer free rides on three 
train routes from Monday to Friday. . . . Of course, they hope to gain from 
their generosity. Ridership has been low, and this might bring more regulars on 
board (B11). 
</P>
<P>
 DEBATABLE: Don't call Valley Presbyterians passive. They've told national 
leaders that it wasn't a good idea to give money to a controversial women's 
conference last year, and they want an investigation (B13). . . . But, in fact, 
the group rejected a more severe response during a long but "decent" debate. 
Said the moderator, a woman pastor from Acton: "There was no name-calling."

HILLARY CLINTON DEFENDS PAST INVESTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an extraordinary moment of White House drama, Hillary Rodham Clinton on 
Friday answered and deflected dozens of questions about her finances and her 
ethics in a 66-minute press conference broadcast live nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady, sitting in a Chippendale-style chair beneath a portrait of 
Abraham Lincoln in the State Dining Room, provided composed and lawyerly 
answers to a swarm of reporters who demanded to know -- with all due deference 
-- whether she and her husband were liars, hypocrites or crooks. 
</P>
<P>
 She maintained her innocence and retained her composure through persistent 
grilling by the White House press corps. She was obviously well prepared for 
the long-awaited appearance, seeming to know where the land mines were in 
questions that reporters had been itching to ask for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But while she appeared to meet each question head on, at the end of the 
session she had added little to the store of knowledge about the cluster of 
controversies known collectively as Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 In a striking series of statements, the First Lady said she believes that she 
had contributed to public perceptions of wrongdoing in recent months by 
refusing to answer questions about the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that trying to maintain a vestige of privacy and her parents' counsel 
to ignore the opinions of others "led me to perhaps be less understanding than 
I needed to be of both the press' and the public's interest, as well as right, 
to know things about my husband and me." 
</P>
<P>
 The wonder of the occasion was not in the news the First Lady made, but that 
the event occurred at all. 
</P>
<P>
 No First Lady has ever submitted to the kind of rough-and-tumble press 
conference that Hillary Clinton volunteered for on Friday. Other presidents' 
wives have conducted mannered chats with reporters over tea or stepped behind 
microphones to make pronouncements for children and against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hillary Clinton -- who described herself Friday as a "transitional figure" 
between more traditional First Ladies of the past and a new breed of 
presidential spouses with independent identities and careers -- handled highly 
specific questions about a series of complex real estate, banking and 
securities investments that took place while her husband was the governor of 
Arkansas and she was a partner in a Little Rock law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 She took on questions about her hugely profitable foray into the commodities 
markets in the 1970s, her knowledge of the Whitewater real estate venture's 
finances in the 1980s and the state of mind of Deputy White House Counsel 
Vincent Foster, a close friend of hers who apparently committed suicide last 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was "extremely comfortable and confident about everything that I 
have done" during the past 16 years and predicted that the broad Whitewater 
investigation by special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. would vindicate her and 
the President. 
</P>
<P>
 On the chief matters of substance on which she was challenged, the First Lady 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 * She had "absolutely no reason to believe" that she profited from favorable 
treatment by her advisers when she parlayed a $1,000 stake in the cattle 
futures market into nearly $100,000 in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * She could not remember "any of the details" of how she turned that initial 
$1,000 investment into $6,300 in her first day of commodities trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * That accepting lucrative investment advice from James B. Blair, attorney for 
Arkansas' largest employer, Tyson Foods Inc., was not unethical because the 
Blairs were "among our very best friends." She denied any impropriety and said 
there were no favors granted Blair or Tyson Foods in exchange. His profitable 
counsel was simply "you know, very fortunate for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * She "can't answer" why she and President Clinton lost considerably less 
money in the Whitewater real estate project than their putative 50-50 partners, 
James B. and Susan McDougal. She denied that the McDougals' greater losses 
amounted to a "gift" from the owner of a state-regulated thrift to the governor 
and his wife. She also said she did not know how the Whitewater project's bills 
were paid after the Clintons stopped contributing to its accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * She has "no memory" of using her commodities-trading profits to make 
Whitewater loan payments, thus reducing her tax liability for 1978. She said 
she got into the Whitewater project to make money, not as a tax dodge. 
</P>
<P>
 * She was told nothing in advance by federal regulators or the White House 
staff about a pending criminal referral on McDougal's failed savings and loan. 
The Clintons were named as possible beneficiaries of questionable acts at the 
thrift, and federal regulators tipped off White House aides about the pending 
referral. 
</P>
<P>
 * She knows nothing about possible shredding of incriminating Whitewater 
material at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where she and Foster used to 
practice. She said reports that she and Clinton shredded documents at the 
governor's mansion in Little Rock were "absolutely" untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady admitted that her insistence on a "zone of privacy" around her 
family and her finances had fueled suspicion that she and the President were 
covering up scandalous details of their life in Arkansas. But she said she 
ultimately had come to be "rezoned" into believing that fuller disclosure would 
ultimately better serve her, her husband and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her stiff resistance to the appointment of a Whitewater special 
counsel and to a full public discussion of the matter for more than four months 
was "one of the things that I regret most" about the entire affair. 
</P>
<P>
 According to aides, the First Lady this week finally came to believe that her 
silence on the Whitewater controversy was doing the Administration more harm 
than good, not only on credibility questions but on the White House's broader 
agenda, particularly health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Her staff was ecstatic about what they believed was her adept handling of the 
questioning, and they expressed belief that the long-dreaded appearance would 
lay to rest public unease about her role in the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady was also asked whether it was hypocritical for her to decry the 
greed and financial excess of the 1980s at a time when she was playing the 
futures markets and investing in speculative real estate ventures. She said it 
was "a pretty long stretch" between trying to provide a nest egg for one's 
family and getting into such things as leveraged buyouts, junk bonds and 
pension-fund raids. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was raised to believe that "every person had an obligation to 
take care of themselves and their family." She said her father "had me reading 
the stock tables when I was a little girl, and I started doing that with my 
daughter when she was a little girl." 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I don't think you'll ever find anything that my husband or I said 
that in any way condemns the importance of making good investments and saving, 
or that in any way undermines what is the heart and soul of the American 
economy, which is risk-taking and investing in the future," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She grew pensive in discussing Foster's death, expressing regret that she 
hadn't spoken with him for more than three weeks before his death. She said she 
has often relived the days and weeks leading up to his death and wondered 
whether if she had called him she might have "picked up a clue." 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of the press conference, a reporter posed a question that had 
been asked of the President during a town meeting in North Carolina two weeks 
ago: "How you can earn our trust back?" 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady said that much of the uneasiness concerning her and her husband 
arises from the fact that they don't fit "pre-existing categories" of what a 
President and First Lady should be. 
</P>
<P>
 She suggested that she may be the victim of bias against accomplished, 
outspoken and independent women. 
</P>
<P>
 She said: "You know, I came to this role having worked my entire life. I mean, 
I started working in the summers when I was 13. I always worked. I worked 
through college. I worked through law school. That's what I did. And after I 
married I continued to work. And after my daughter was born, with the exception 
of the four months I took off for maternity leave, I worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think that, having been independent, having made decisions, it's a 
little difficult for us as a country, maybe, to make the transition of having a 
woman like many of the women in this room sitting in this house. So I think 
that the standards and, to some extent, . . . the expectations and the demands 
have changed, and I'm trying to find my way through it and trying to figure out 
how best to be true to myself and how to fulfill my responsibilities to my 
husband and my daughter and the country."

HATA: JAPAN'S HOPE TO END PARALYSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tsutomu Hata began using wooden business cards when he was promoting Japanese 
wood products two decades ago, and he still carries them. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was pitching silk as one of the Parliament's agricultural experts, he 
switched to silk underwear. He continues to wear silk. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata still dutifully dons short-sleeved summer suits to promote energy 
conservation, cheerfully oblivious to the outdated look. 
</P>
<P>
 And the man who will become Japan's next prime minister still insists that 
Japanese intestines are longer than Western guts, an infamous comment he made 
in 1987 when he was agricultural minister arguing that foreign beef imports 
should be banned because the meat would be indigestible here. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, 58, who is expected to win election as Japan's prime minister on Monday, 
is one of the nation's consummate political pitchmen. Sell him on an idea, say 
those close to him, and he'll bite into it like a bulldog. Then he will spend 
hours trying to win converts, using his famous gift of gab, likable manner and 
tenacity. 
</P>
<P>
 He may lack the intellectual intensity and strategic vision of his chief 
political ally, Ichiro Ozawa of the Japan Renewal Party, who is regarded as 
Hata's brain. But at a time of deep political turmoil and policy paralysis, of 
sharp disputes within the fragile eight-party governing coalition, Hata's 
nice-guy approach, his ability to bring people together and coax them into 
consensus may be what the nation needs most now, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's basically a man of moderation and harmony and might be appropriate at 
this time of political fluidity and the need to form a majority coalition," 
said Takashi Inoguchi, a Tokyo University political science professor. "A more 
spearheading kind of leader would create too many enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the flip side of the coin is that his political content is so . . . 
shallow that some people find him a little boring." 
</P>
<P>
 As a soon-to-be prime minister, Hata's single greatest defining factor is his 
symbiotic relationship with Ozawa, analysts say. Hata provides the sales pitch 
for Ozawa's policy, they say, seducing the public through persuasion. His way 
contrasts with Ozawa's heavy-handedness, and his boyish charm serves as "the 
mask to cover the dirty face of Ozawa," one analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata brings few of the public expectations that surrounded the man he will 
succeed, Morihiro Hosokawa. Hosokawa, who announced his intent to resign two 
weeks ago under a cloud of questionable financial transactions, was a fresh and 
relatively unknown political aristocrat. He symbolized the public's desire for 
change from the system of back-room deals and corrupt money politics honed 
under the Liberal Democratic Party's 38-year reign. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, however, is very much an Establishment politician, a protege of the 
master of money politics, former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. Still, he is 
relatively free of the taint of scandal -- he has a poor reputation as a 
fund-raiser and has few ties to the powerful construction industry -- which has 
long fueled Japanese politics. 
</P>
<P>
 He says it was precisely his exposure to the dark side of Japanese politics as 
chief of the LDP's Election Bureau in 1984 that persuaded him to try to reduce 
the need for money in elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is anyone who has seen both the good and bad side of Japanese 
politics, it is me," he told a Japanese magazine last year. "Japan is now too 
important to have its political reputation defined by scandal and indecision." 
</P>
<P>
 Few, however, expect Hata to blaze new trails. He has held the critical posts 
of ministers of finance, foreign affairs and agriculture during his 24-year 
political career, making him one of the most experienced leaders in the 
coalition. But no one can recall any distinctive "Hata color" he gave to his 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing his reputation among Japanese politicians, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun 
said: "His enemies are few, but he is an eight-sided beauty with no core 
beliefs" -- an expression for a person who tries to please everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 His chief role may be to hold the shaky coalition together until its competing 
factions begin to sort themselves out after the next general election. Despite 
his social charms, however, some analysts predict that the coalition won't last 
even that long and may yet fall apart within weeks, dooming a Hata 
Administration to one of the shortest in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Hata has two formidable factors in his favor: the backing of the 
nation's powerful bureaucrats and the mass media. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the mandarins became openly derisive of Hosokawa's 
inexperience as time went on, a growing number are persuaded that they need to 
help the Hata Cabinet succeed, political commentator Minoru Morita said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Increasingly, many more officials of the central government believe that in 
order to stop Japan's credibility from falling further, we should avoid at all 
costs another change of government," Morita said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata enjoys good press mainly because he takes the time to talk to reporters 
in clear language. 
</P>
<P>
 At an appearance before foreign correspondents in August, he made headlines by 
saying Japan owed Asia an apology for World War II rather than the usual 
diplomatic equivocation of expressions of "regret." He also said the government 
should apologize to victims of the atomic bomb and other war victims. His 
comments preceded Hosokawa's widely reported apology for Japan's waging of a 
"war of aggression." 
</P>
<P>
 Propped up on policy by Ozawa and the bureaucrats, analysts say, Hata is 
likely to aim his public speaking skills at forming a national consensus on two 
of Japan's hottest issues: North Korea's nuclear threat, and tax policy, 
including a consumption tax hike to finance an income tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wants to correct the image of Japan as a "nation with no face," by 
saying yes and no clearly and conveying a sense of Japan's direction to the 
world, said his wife, Yasuko, in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike recent prime ministers -- the scholarly Kiichi Miyazawa, the 
aristocratic Hosokawa -- Hata is known for using the plain language of the 
people. One of his mottoes, hanging in his office, is that "Politics is 
connected to plain language." 
</P>
<P>
 Hata was born Aug. 24, 1935, the oldest of four sons in a family of 
politicians in Nagano prefecture, a region of breathtaking natural beauty, high 
educational achievement and new social trends two hours by train from Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 But his grass-roots bona fides were established during a decade as a grunt for 
the Odakyu Bus Co. in Tokyo, where he started out as a ticket puncher and ended 
up as a tour planner. 
</P>
<P>
 No whiz kid, he had gotten the job through his father's connections after 
being first rejected by the Asahi and Nihon Keizai newspapers. He moved to tour 
planning from accounting partly because, despite earning a degree in economics, 
he was weak at calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was always popular. He was a ringleader of groups ranging from 
noodle-eating clubs to a student bank. Friends called him a "carrier pigeon" 
because he constantly shuttled around visiting friends. 
</P>
<P>
 He was drafted into politics reluctantly when his father died, and he won his 
first lower house election in 1969. After a long political career allied with 
Tanaka and former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, he broke away from the LDP 
last year with Ozawa and 42 other members to form the Japan Renewal Party. 
Their defection led to the end of the LDP's 38-year iron-clad rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, however, never forgot his roots. Unlike the Armani ties and custom-made 
suits sported by Hosokawa, his clothes are no-name, off-the-rack. His wife says 
he socializes little with other politicians, preferring instead a night of sake 
and noodles at inexpensive joints with good friends from his bus company days. 
Or he attends concerts with such pals as conductor Seiji Ozawa, a fellow 
graduate of Seijo University in Tokyo.  
</P>
<P>
 Unusual for a Japanese politician, Hata and his wife, whom he met in college, 
frequently socialize as a couple. After graduation, he insisted that she and 
their children live with him in Tokyo rather than stay in the local district, 
as is the common practice, because he saw how his father's political career had 
disrupted his own family life. Yasaku Hata says he discusses virtually all 
political issues with her, soliciting her opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 He has maintained such a normal life that "there really hasn't been any 
difference" in shifting from a bus company wife to a political one, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That normality and reliance on persuasion "would give him the qualities needed 
to be a leader at a time of peace," the analyst Morita said. "But I harbor 
certain doubts about whether or not he can lead in times of confusion."

NIXON DIES; EX-PRESIDENT WAS MAJOR FIGURE ON WORLD STAGE; PRESIDENCY: FOREIGN 
POLICY ACHIEVEMENTS WERE OBSCURED BY WATERGATE SCANDAL. THE FIRST U.S. CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE TO RESIGN OFFICE WAS 81. HE SUFFERED MASSIVE STROKE AND WAS IN COMA 
AT TIME OF HIS DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Nixon, who strode the world stage for decades and was the only 
American President to resign his office to avoid impeachment, died Friday 
night, four days after suffering a stroke. He was 81 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said Nixon, the nation's 37th President, was pronounced dead at 
9:08 p.m. at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where he had been taken 
by ambulance from his home in Park Ridge, N.J. His daughters, Julie Nixon 
Eisenhower and Patricia Nixon Cox, were at his bedside. His wife, Pat, died 
last June of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said the Nixon family "know that the best wishes of all 
Americans are with them during their moment of sorrow." He praised Nixon as "a 
statesman who sought to build a lasting structure of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave of himself with devotion," Clinton said. "His country owes him a 
debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he would attend the funeral at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif. The library said the funeral will be held 
Wednesday at 4 p.m., followed by a private burial at the library near the grave 
of Pat Nixon.  
</P>
<P>
 At Nixon's request, there will be no ceremonies in Washington, D.C., where 
former presidents often lie in state at the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 The former President had made out a living will stating he did not want heroic 
measures in the face of devastating illness. Respecting his wishes, his 
breathing was not assisted in his final days by a respirator. He had been in a 
coma since Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the decade before his death, the former President demonstrated the 
uncommon resiliency that characterized his long and turbulent public life. 
</P>
<P>
 Many never forgave him for the activities that forced him from office as an 
unindicted co-conspirator of the Watergate scandal. Yet after a decade of 
shadowy, self-imposed exile, he had reclaimed a place on the national stage as 
a wise man of foreign policy. Through his writings, his visits to Moscow and 
Asia and his private conversations with world leaders, he had succeeded in 
raising himself from the political depths to the pantheon of elder statesmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the men who have occupied the White House before and since, Nixon's 
place in history is perhaps the most ambiguous and stirs the most divergent of 
sentiments. For nearly half a century, in office and out, he commanded the 
nation's fascinated attention, inspiring both unshakable admiration and 
relentless loathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen one individual as targeted in terms of hatred as Richard 
Nixon. There is no question that Nixon brought out this passion," said Herbert 
S. Parmet, a history professor at City University of New York and author of 
"Richard Nixon and His America." 
</P>
<P>
 His name will forever be linked to what his White House dismissed as the 
third-rate burglary at Democratic Party headquarters in Washington's Watergate 
office complex -- a brief episode on the night of June 17, 1972, that 
ultimately led to his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with that ghost, he remained a figure to be reckoned with: His 
pronouncements on issues of war and peace carried complex echoes of a political 
career born in a successful campaign for Congress in 1946, when the nation was 
in the throes of anti-communist fervor. He was still heeded nearly 50 years 
later, long after his political clout had vanished. Lasting Achievement 
</P>
<P>
 Before scandal ended his presidency on Aug. 9, 1974, in the midst of his 
second term, Nixon claimed a lasting achievement in the historic opening to 
China: His decision to end the Cold War isolation of the Asian giant won him 
acclaim even from liberal critics, who acknowledged that only a leader with 
ironclad anti-communist credentials could have accomplished the task. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he shared responsibility for escalation of the Vietnam War, and his 
Administration was the target of the most bitter and vehement anti-war 
protests, he also began the drawdown that led to the ultimate departure of U.S. 
troops from the Southeast Asian nation. 
</P>
<P>
 On domestic policy, he took unique positions for a Republican leader of his 
era, presenting the first proposal for a negative income tax, which would have 
distributed federal funds to the poorest citizens; imposing controls on wages 
and prices to stabilize the economy, and proposing overhauls of welfare and 
health care -- measures that have only now returned to the top of the agenda, 
in the White House of a Democratic President. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was less of a partisan Republican than many believe, too independent for 
many, a man who used rhetoric as a stiletto. The rhetoric, more than anything 
else apart from Watergate, got him in trouble. It was what made people 
associate him with the right wing," Parmet said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an extraordinarily deft politician and perhaps the most resilient 
political figure of the modern era, displaying an almost uncanny ability to 
rebound from near-disaster. Yet he never fit neatly into either the Republican 
Party's moderate wing of Nelson A. Rockefeller or the conservative camp of 
Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. Comeback, Comedown 
</P>
<P>
 With an emotional speech less than two months before Election Day, 1952, he 
regained his hold on the Republican vice presidential nomination after being 
accused of paying personal expenses with an $18,235 "slush fund" created by 
wealthy Californians. As vice president for eight years, he survived a sour 
relationship with President Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 And from his cliffhanger loss of the presidency in 1960 to John F. Kennedy, 
and his loss of the California governorship in 1962 to Edmund G. (Pat) Brown 
Sr., he staged a remarkable comeback. In 1968, the most turbulent political 
year in the past half-century -- when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. 
Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated, when national political conventions were 
disrupted by riots -- he emerged from the smoke and tear gas and generational 
anger to defeat Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and claim his prize: the 
presidency of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, he scored a record-setting landslide victory against 
Democratic Sen. George S. McGovern of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his successes, his career was dogged by the shadows of a darker 
side. He was awkward in public. He never demonstrated the ease of a successful 
politician, nor seemed to take any comfort from the adulation of the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 On a deeper level, he was by nature suspicious and mistrustful. 
</P>
<P>
 It was those qualities that allowed -- indeed enabled -- the burglary at the 
Watergate to escalate into the most stunning presidential debacle in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it ended with his resignation, it had ensnared not only the President, 
but the most senior members of his White House staff, Cabinet members and the 
FBI, which he was accused of misusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more important, and certainly more lasting, it spread across the 
body politic a cynicism that infects the political process to this day. The 
Early Years 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Milhous Nixon was born Jan. 9, 1913, to a Quaker mother and a 
Methodist father in Yorba Linda, where he spent the early years of his life 
before his family moved to Whittier. As a young boy, he did well in school and 
worked in his father's grocery store, which provided the family with a modest 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 He graduated from Whittier College in 1934, ranking second in his class and 
earning plaudits and respect for his debating skills. He enrolled at Duke Law 
School, where he was known as a bookish young man who often studied while 
classmates played. He graduated third in his class and returned to Whittier, 
where he practiced trial law. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at a Whittier community theater, where they were auditioning for parts 
in a play, that Nixon met Thelma Catherine (Pat) Ryan, a tall, lithesome 
strawberry-blonde who was a shorthand and typing teacher at the high school. 
They were married in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, with World War II raging, Nixon began a four-year stint in 
the Navy. After the war, he returned to California and immediately sought and 
won a seat in Congress in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the young Republican quickly gained a reputation for his 
zealous pursuit of communists working in the federal government. His platform 
was the House Un-American Activities Committee, and his most famous case 
involved Whittaker Chambers, a confessed Communist Party courier, and former 
State Department official Alger Hiss, who was accused by Chambers of passing 
secrets to Soviet agents. Senate Campaign 
</P>
<P>
 The reputation boosted his popularity at home, and he rode the wave into his 
1950 campaign for U.S. Senate. In that storied contest, Nixon branded his 
Democratic opponent, Helen Mary Gahagan Douglas, "the Pink Lady" and accused 
the New Deal Democrat of supporting American Labor Party leader Vito 
Marcantonio, a representative from New York known in Congress as a communist 
sympathizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's supporters blanketed California with bright pink leaflets that linked 
Douglas and Marcantonio in House votes. With America in the throes of 
anti-communist fears, Nixon's tactic was devastating. He won by nearly 700,000 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate contest brought Nixon national recognition, and the ambitious young 
politician, who had a scant half-decade of elected public service, trained his 
sights next on national office. He assailed President Harry S. Truman as soft 
on communism and correctly surmised that Eisenhower was a rising star in the 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon worked for the revered general's 1952 presidential candidacy and was 
selected as Eisenhower's vice presidential running mate. He was 39 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by a rousing reception at the Republican convention, Nixon hit the 
campaign trail with vigor -- only to run into charges that he had personally 
benefited from the "slush fund" established by millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
 In what became known as the Checkers speech, Nixon defended himself against 
the charges in a nationwide radio and television address. He detailed modest 
personal items belonging to him and his family, including Checkers, a spaniel 
given to his children by an admirer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat and I have the satisfaction that every dime that we've got is honestly 
ours. I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat. But she does have a 
respectable Republican cloth coat, and I always tell her that she would look 
good in anything," the struggling candidate said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that I ought to quit, because I am not a quitter," Nixon 
said. "But the decision, my friends, is not mine." He went on to urge those in 
the audience to express their views to the Republican National Committee about 
whether he should be taken off the GOP ticket. The public responded with more 
than 2 million letters and telegrams, urging him to stay by a margin of 350 to 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're my boy," Eisenhower told Nixon after the broadcast. Road to Presidency 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of a landslide victory that fall, Nixon began serving the first of 
his two terms as vice president -- during which he enjoyed extraordinary 
symbolic powers, even if his actual influence on policy was less substantive. 
</P>
<P>
 He was called upon to take an extensive goodwill tour of Asia in 1953, and he 
visited Central America in 1955 and South America in 1958. During his visit to 
Caracas, Venezuela, leftist mobs smashed Nixon's automobile windows and perhaps 
would have killed him had Venezuelan troops not arrived. For his part, Nixon 
earned praise for maintaining calm during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominated as his party's presidential candidate in 1960, Nixon became a victim 
of the same medium that had served him so well in the Checkers speech. His 
narrow loss to Kennedy was attributed largely to the striking difference 
between the two candidates in televised debates. Nixon's heavy jowls, shadowed 
by stubble, and his nervous manner played poorly alongside Kennedy's relaxed 
confidence, wit and youthful good looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's political fortunes continued to sink as he lost the tough 
gubernatorial fight to Brown in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the anti-communist tactic failed Nixon, and in defeat he accused the 
media of sustained bias in covering his political career. His parting shot 
during his concession speech: "I leave you gentlemen now, and you will now 
write it. You will interpret it. That's your right. But as I leave you I want 
you to know -- just think how much you're going to be missing. You won't have 
Nixon to kick around anymore, because, gentlemen, this is my last press 
conference." 
</P>
<P>
 But he came back. After joining a New York law firm in 1963, Nixon, showing 
party loyalty, campaigned for Barry Goldwater in the conservative Arizonan's 
humiliating 1964 presidential race. Nixon became an effective fund-raiser and 
set his sights once more on the White House, winning the Republican 
presidential nomination in 1968 and going on to narrowly defeat Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's victory that year was attributed to shrewd planning that exploited 
deep divisions among the Democrats who controlled the government. The diligent 
young men who ran the Nixon campaign became the core of the new White House 
staff, where they were extraordinarily adept at synthesizing problems for the 
President's action and at shielding him from unwanted intrusion, protecting the 
privacy he cherished. New Ideas Flourish 
</P>
<P>
 In the afterglow of his election on Nov. 5, 1968, Nixon told supporters that 
his goal was to "bring the American people together" under "an open 
Administration, open to new ideas, open to men and women of both parties, open 
to the critics as well as those who support us." 
</P>
<P>
 New ideas indeed flourished in his Administration's dealings with the 
communist world and in its concerted effort to reduce the federal role in 
routine government functions. The number of women in high posts increased, and 
even Democrats occasionally were appointed to the Nixon Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Nixon White House always reflected the reclusive 
temperament and industrious work habits of its resident -- habits shaped by his 
early years of work in his father's grocery store. Access to this 
Administration was never open. Information was tightly controlled and 
unauthorized news leaks brought reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, Nixon appealed for a "new majority" that crossed the middle-class 
spectrum, but he left most campaigning to a platoon of "surrogate candidates" 
headed by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the White House staff were deeply involved in oversight of the 
lavishly financed operation. With the nation deeply divided over the Vietnam 
War and weary of radical and occasionally violent confrontations on college 
campuses, Nixon's campaign called for law and order in the United States and a 
strong American role overseas, and it portrayed his Democratic opponent, 
McGovern, as a liberal who sympathized with college demonstrators and who would 
surrender America's interests abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon won by an overwhelming margin, with 61% of the popular vote and 521 
electoral votes to McGovern's 17. 
</P>
<P>
 During his 5 1/2 years as President, Nixon was confronted by a series of 
domestic and foreign crises, including inflation and the cancerous Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's escalation of U.S. involvement in the war ignited a firestorm of 
domestic protests. At the same time, he tried to mute the criticism by ending 
the draft in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Law and order was one of Nixon's prime domestic concerns: It was foreshadowed 
in 1968 campaign speeches, in which he saddled the Democrats with blame for 
mounting crime statistics. After the election, the theme was apparent in his 
choice of hard-line conservative John N. Mitchell, his former law partner and 
campaign director, to be his attorney general. It also was manifest in the 
Administration's requests for measures to strengthen the prosecution's hand in 
criminal cases, in the conservative trend of Nixon's judicial appointments and 
in his Administration's response to anti-war demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrations began during the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration and they 
continued despite Nixon's warning at a 1969 news conference that "under no 
circumstances will I be affected by them." Nor were the demonstrators appeased 
by Nixon's decision in June, 1969, to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests spread from U.S. campuses, and about half a million Americans 
took part nationwide in a solemn, orderly "moratorium day" on Oct. 15, 1969. 
Vietnam War Protests 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's stated plan for Vietnam was to "Vietnamize" the war by training and 
equipping South Vietnamese troops for an ever-larger role in the conflict. But 
it also entailed bold military strokes to protect the Americans who remained in 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in April, 1970, an attack was secretly mounted on the communist bases in 
the jungles of neutral Cambodia, and anti-war protests revived. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation was horrified on May 4, 1970, when a confrontation between 
demonstrating students and Ohio National Guard troops at Kent State University 
ended in a volley from Guard rifles that left four young people dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon issued a stiff statement that deplored the affair and observed that, 
"when dissent turns to violence, it invites tragedy." Within a week, upward of 
50,000 students converged on Washington in an unplanned protest that was bitter 
but nonviolent. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid signs of White House concern, student groups were invited to talk with 
presidential aides, and Nixon met with a group from Kent State to say he 
recognized the right of peaceful protest. 
</P>
<P>
 At dawn the next morning, the President appeared unannounced among 
demonstrators bivouacked at the Lincoln Memorial. He later said he advised the 
students: "Keep it peaceful -- remember, I feel as deeply as you do about 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 But the demonstrations flared again after U.S. planes provided massive support 
to South Vietnamese troops that crossed the border into Laos in February, 1971, 
in another attempt to destroy communist sanctuaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon viewed street disorders as an outward symbol of a trend to 
"permissiveness," which he deplored as a candidate and as President. He sought 
to reverse it by appointment of judges committed to rigid interpretations of 
the Constitution, and he began at the top with the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 No actions of the Nixon presidency may have cast a longer shadow into the 
future than the lifetime appointments he made to fill the four vacancies on the 
nine-seat court that occurred during his first term. Collectively, the changes 
spelled the end of the liberal activism that had characterized high court 
decisions for nearly two decades. 2 Nominees Rejected 
</P>
<P>
 The process was not easy for the President, for two of his nominees were 
rejected by the Senate after tempestuous confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon had no difficulty in winning clearance in May, 1969, for Warren E. 
Burger, a conservative appeals court judge from Minnesota, to replace the 
retiring Earl Warren as chief justice. 
</P>
<P>
 A second vacancy cleared the way in August, 1969, for nomination of Clement F. 
Haynsworth, a South Carolina appeals judge, but the Senate balked. It also 
rejected G. Harrold Carswell, the Florida district judge Nixon nominated after 
Haynsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon protested that he could not achieve confirmation for a strict 
constructionist who "happens to come from the South," and nominated Harry A. 
Blackmun, a Minnesota appeals court judge. Blackmun, who became the court's 
leading liberal, is retiring in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout much of his tenure, Nixon was plagued by a troubled national 
economy, resulting largely from a combination of Vietnam War expenditures and 
Johnson's spending on Great Society programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican President tried a series of economic remedies, including a 
90-day freeze on all wages and prices in 1971, with any increases subject to 
approval by a cost of living council. Nixon also persuaded Congress to change 
the Post Office Department into the quasi-private agency it is today. 
</P>
<P>
 And, with the help of Congress, he embarked on a course of "new federalism," 
providing state and local jurisdictions with $30 billion over five years as 
revenue-sharing funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiatives were part of a period of experimentation with domestic policy, 
producing a precursor to some of the programs being advanced now by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nixon generally ignored minorities and the poor, developing few 
programs targeting them, he did attempt in 1969 to overhaul the welfare system 
through a guaranteed annual income, thereby departing dramatically from 
Republican tenets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan, created by Nixon aide Daniel Patrick Moynihan, now a U.S. 
senator from New York, was scrapped the next year as congressional liberals and 
Southern Democrats opposed it. In addition, blacks were skeptical of the 
proposal, noting Nixon's persistent criticism of busing as a remedy for school 
desegregation and his efforts to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices. 
Domestic Vs. Foreign 
</P>
<P>
 For Nixon, the salvation of blacks was in "black capitalism," a theme he 
explored in a speech in October, 1965, to black Republicans at a $300-a-plate 
dinner in New York. Nixon, whose 1969 executive order established the Office of 
Minority Business Enterprise, likened the group of blacks to sports heroes, 
saying they should shun quotas and instead seek progress by "being the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the success of Jackie Robinson in baseball and Arthur Ashe in tennis, 
Nixon said: "These people are not champions because they are part of a quota, 
but because they are the best. The same has to happen in private enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many believe that his record on domestic issues was mixed, Nixon's 
foreign policy achievements were more apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1972, the onetime redbaiter visited Moscow -- just two weeks after the 
Soviet Union had vehemently criticized a new round of U.S. air attacks launched 
on North Vietnam in a double-edged effort to blunt a communist offensive in the 
South and to jolt the Hanoi regime into serious peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite continuing differences on Vietnam, Nixon and Soviet leaders signed 
agreements to limit offensive and defensive strategic weapons. A spate of 
lesser accords also flowed from the meetings. One byproduct was a $1-billion 
deal to sell U.S. grain to Russia that brought election-year joy to American 
wheat farmers as a supply squeeze boosted domestic prices to record highs. 
</P>
<P>
 The former President's pragmatic views toward the Soviet Union showed up years 
later, in March, 1986, when he addressed the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, 
calling for "a new realism" in dealing with the Soviets. Nixon said the two 
superpowers "can never be friends, but we cannot afford to be enemies," and he 
urged leaders of both countries to avoid an "insane" continuation of the 
nuclear arms race. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon cited the "Nixon Doctrine" as one of his more significant contributions 
to foreign policy. Initiated partly to quell domestic criticism of the Vietnam 
War, the doctrine acknowledged the limitations of U.S. military power and 
promised to restrict its use in international crises that might arise in the 
future. China Triumph 
</P>
<P>
 But clearly, Nixon's greatest triumph was with China, especially his trip 
there in February, 1972. It was a political image maker's dream: the hard-line 
anti-communist visiting the world's largest communist country and pronouncing 
it fit for relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times in June, 1984, Nixon cited a 1968 article he 
had written advocating improved relations with China and said, "I had made up 
my mind before coming to office" to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw the long-term importance the Pacific Basin held for the United States, 
said Parmet, the historian, "and he felt very concerned about pursuing our 
interests in that area without China." 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, Nixon's trip led to limited resumption of U.S.-Chinese 
relations, which had been frozen since the Korean War, and to modest trade, 
travel and cultural agreements. Ultimately, it led in 1978 to resumption of 
full diplomatic relations and steadily expanding relationships in many 
non-military fields under the Jimmy Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1986, Nixon had paid four return visits to China as an ex-President and was 
received on each occasion as an elder statesman. In February, 1976, for 
example, he and Mrs. Nixon went to what was then Peking as guests of the 
government at ceremonies that officially commemorated the fourth anniversary of 
his initial visit and unofficially provided desired exposure for Acting Premier 
Hua Guofend, who praised Nixon's "farsightedness" in building ties between 
Peking and Washington. Mao Tse-tung, China's venerable Communist Party 
chairman, gave Nixon an audience that lasted an hour and 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hua had succeeded Mao as party chairman when the Nixons paid their second 
visit in September, 1979, again as a guest of the government, and Deng Xiaoping 
was in Hua's powerful former post. When Nixon visited China in September, 1985, 
a college vice president glowingly described Nixon as "an old friend of China," 
and the Chinese mobbed him after a speech as he headed for a Red Flag 
limousine, seeking his autograph or just a touch of his hand. Trouble at Home 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon also was received like a hero in Egypt in June, 1974 -- even as the 
curtain was rising on the last act of the Watergate drama. He made the trip as 
part of a Middle East tour that also took him to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Syria 
and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then, Nixon was a President disgraced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Watergate scandal was named for the June, 1972, break-in at Democratic 
headquarters at the Watergate, a sleek, sprawling office and apartment complex 
that overlooks the Potomac River near Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenuous links to the White House were made soon after the break-in, when some 
of the burglars -- who were caught by a security guard -- were found to be 
carrying White House telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode was initially dismissed by the White House as a "third-rate 
burglary" unauthorized by anyone of rank. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the next two years, inquiries pressed first by a judge and the 
press, then by Congress and special prosecutors, unraveled a web of political 
crimes: "hush money" paid to the burglars, other efforts to block 
investigators, wiretaps of "White House enemies," establishment of the White 
House "plumbers" to plug information leaks, campaign "dirty tricks" and more. 
</P>
<P>
 The developing scandal diminished public confidence in the President. In late 
1973, it limited his efforts to cope with an energy crisis that threw the 
economy into a tailspin. The immediate effects were a quick jump in 
unemployment and a surge in an inflation rate that already was causing concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon had proposed a long-range program to make the nation self-sufficient in 
energy resources before the crisis struck. But his Administration was 
ill-prepared when a new flare-up of hostilities between Israel and its Arab 
neighbors led in October, 1973, to an Arab embargo on export of oil to nations 
friendly to Israel -- particularly the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 While thermostats were lowered and lines at gasoline stations grew longer, 
Nixon dispatched Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger to half a dozen capitals 
in an attempt to loosen the embargo and bring peace to the area. Kissinger's 
prodding helped produce an uneasy truce between Israel and Egypt, and Arab oil 
began flowing again after a five-month shut-off. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, Watergate continued to unravel. As public revelations brought 
responsibility for the cover-up closer and closer to the White House, Nixon's 
top lieutenants toppled like dominoes. First Mitchell resigned as his campaign 
director. Then H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman, his closest White House 
aides, resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 A Senate committee chaired by the late Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.) investigated 
Watergate on national television in the spring and summer of 1973 and learned 
that a secret taping system had recorded all of Nixon's White House 
conversations. The evidence from those tapes, which are still played daily for 
tourists at the National Archives, proved to be some of the most damning 
against the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days after the break-in, Nixon, on tape, agreed with a suggestion by his 
chief of staff, Haldeman, that orders should be given to the Central 
Intelligence Agency to impede the FBI's investigation of the Watergate money 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
 But what was not on the tapes was equally damning: On one of the seemingly 
most crucial tapes, a gap of about 18 minutes and 15 seconds gave rise to 
suspicion that even more damaging statements had been erased. 
</P>
<P>
 And, with the raw presidential language demonstrated on the tapes, their 
publication introduced to the American vocabulary the phrase "expletive 
deleted." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon initially refused to turn over the tapes to Archibald Cox, the special 
Watergate prosecutor in the Justice Department. When Cox pressed his demand, 
Nixon ordered Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson to fire him. In what became known 
as the "Saturday night massacre," Nixon fired first Richardson and then his 
deputy, William D. Ruckelshaus, for refusing to fire Cox, before Solicitor 
General Robert H. Bork became acting attorney general and carried out Nixon's 
order. 'I'm Not a Crook' 
</P>
<P>
 The President of the United States persevered. "I'm not a crook," he told a 
November, 1973, meeting of journalists at Disney World in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The same could not be said of other top figures in the Administration. After 
Houston attorney Leon Jaworski replaced Cox as Watergate special prosecutor, a 
grand jury indicted Mitchell, Haldeman, Ehrlichman and four others on charges 
of covering up the Watergate break-in. Nixon was named as an unindicted 
co-conspirator. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1974, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of 
impeachment, charging Nixon with obstructing justice, misusing his presidential 
power and defying committee subpoenas. But before the full House could consider 
the impeachment articles, Nixon resigned on Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "If some of my judgments were wrong -- and some were wrong -- they were made 
in what I believed at the time to be the best interest of the nation," Nixon 
said as he announced his resignation. But he admitted no guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was not involved in the decision to conduct the break-in, I should 
have set a higher standard for the conduct of the people who participated in my 
campaign and Administration. I should have established a moral tone that would 
have made such actions unthinkable. I did not," Nixon wrote in 1990 in his 
ninth book, "In the Arena." Emerging From Exile 
</P>
<P>
 A month after his resignation, many in the country were outraged when Nixon's 
successor, Gerald R. Ford, issued a pardon for all crimes that Nixon "committed 
or may have committed or taken part in" during his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Retreating to Casa Pacifica, his beachfront home in San Clemente, Calif., 
Nixon made few forays outside. For a time, an occasional 18 holes of golf with 
close friends at the Shorecliff Club near San Clemente was his most public 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 But he emerged three years later for five televised conversations with 
interviewer David Frost. In the interviews, excerpted from 20 hours of tapes 
and for which Nixon was paid upward of $600,000, the former President displayed 
the full range of his moods, from self-pitying gloom to expansive confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let down my friends. I let down the country. I let down our system of 
government," Nixon said. He conceded that he had come so close to the "edge of 
the law" in advising White House associates on "how to present their cases" 
that a "reasonable person could call that a cover-up." 
</P>
<P>
 But he declared that he "didn't think of it as a cover-up" and said: "If I 
intended to cover up, believe me, I'd have done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's revealing interviews were televised as he and a rear guard of 
loyalists finished work on the former President's memoirs. Tale of Two Books 
</P>
<P>
 As a personalized footnote, the work was dubious history. Nixon's foes 
campaigned against it under the slogan, "Don't buy books from crooks." But the 
1,090-page book, "RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon," yielded close to $2 
million in syndication rights and royalties for its author. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon told Frost that his wife, Pat, had suffered a stroke in 1976, three days 
after reading "The Final Days," a book about Nixon's last days in office by Bob 
Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the Washington Post reporters whose aggressive 
pursuit of the Watergate story had won the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize. Calling 
the book trash, Nixon said the media had achieved a "license to lie," and 
suggested that public figures under media attack should "come right back and 
crack 'em in the puss." 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since, however, Nixon mellowed and began emerging more frequently 
into the public eye. Most recently, in mid-March, he made his 10th visit to 
Russia and met with the ultranationalist leader Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, whom 
he described as "a brilliant political tactician" who "pushes hot-button issues 
that are totally irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the former President wrote in the New York Times that "Russia's 
political scene can only be described as chaotic." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing up to the final days of his life the role he carved out for himself -- 
that of the interpreter for the United States of the mysterious ways of the 
Kremlin -- he wrote: "President Yeltsin has lost much of the mystique from his 
historic role in the destruction of Soviet Communism. He may be finding that 
history is against him. Over the centuries, revolutionary leaders have not been 
good nation-builders." 
</P>
<P>
 It was through such writings -- his 10th book is expected to be published in 
June -- that Nixon worked assiduously to repair his public image, and he did so 
with some success. 
</P>
<P>
 When he left office, his popularity stood at 26%. But another measure of 
popularity in 1986 demonstrated a rebound: 54% said Ford was correct to have 
pardoned him and nearly 40% said they would like to see him in a public role, 
as an ambassador or presidential adviser. Still, a poll last November found 
that only 37% approved of the job he had done as President -- trailing Kennedy 
and each subsequent President, with the exception of Johnson. 
</P>

 Although out of the Watergate shadow, he kept a relatively low profile. He 
offered advice to Republican candidates, and political handicapping. In June, 
1992, he predicted a close presidential race between George Bush and Ross 
Perot; in September of that year, he told Bush -- correctly, it turned out -- 
to give up on California. 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, he expressed himself on the domestic issues of the day, taking 
what his onetime speech writer, William Safire, pegged a progressive position 
in a column last December in the New York Times: 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion? "The state should stay out; don't subsidize and don't prohibit." 
</P>
<P>
 Gun control? "I'd go further than the Brady bill. Guns are an abomination." 
</P>
<P>
 TV violence? "Hollywood thinks America is sick . . . ! They're the sick ones." 
</P>
<P>
 He quietly tried to head off the lifting of the trade embargo on Vietnam, more 
than a year before Clinton eventually took such action, and he spoke by 
telephone with Clinton -- eventually meeting with him privately -- to tutor him 
on the need for the United States to take the lead in delivering aid to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nixons sold Casa Pacifica in mid-1979 to three Orange County businessmen 
and moved without ceremony to a Manhattan townhouse for which they paid 
$750,000 in February, 1980. They sold it, too, in September, 1981, to the 
Syrian government for $2.6 million as a residence for its U.N. ambassador. 
Leaving Manhattan, they bought a modern dwelling in suburban Saddle River, 
N.J., for a reported $1 million, and, later, moved to the nearby community of 
Park Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the books the former President wrote after leaving office 
dealt with foreign policy and his view of the world, "In the Arena" was more 
personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two thousand years ago, the poet Sophocles wrote, 'One must wait until the 
evening to see how splendid the day has been.' There is still some time before 
the sun goes down, but even now, I can look back and say that the day has 
indeed been splendid," Nixon wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 He concluded: 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, what matters is that you have always lived life to the hilt. I 
have been on the highest mountains and in the deepest valleys, but I have never 
lost sight of my destination -- a world in which peace and freedom can live 
together. I have won some great victories and suffered some devastating 
defeats. But win or lose, I feel fortunate to have come to that time in life 
when I can finally enjoy what my Quaker grandmother would have called 'peace at 
the center.' "

LANDLORDS SUFFER AS FEARFUL QUAKE VICTIMS MOVE AWAY; HOUSING: TENANTS WANT 
STABLE GROUND. IN HARD-HIT AREAS, EVEN SEISMICALLY SOUND, LOW-RENT UNITS FIND 
FEW TAKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One day after the Jan. 17 quake crumpled the walls of their ground-floor 
Sherman Oaks apartment, Jim Currah and his fiancee, Gloria Villa, had found a 
new home: a roomy, second-story apartment in Glendale, nearly 20 miles from the 
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple never considered the vacant apartments that had withstood the quake 
in their old neighborhood, a quiet tree-lined enclave of luxury buildings with 
heated pools, weight rooms and saunas. "We wanted to get as far away as 
possible," said Villa, a student at Southwestern University School of Law. 
"We'd go back to New York if we could." 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months since the Northridge quake, many people have followed in 
the couple's footsteps, leaving familiar neighborhoods in a search for stable 
ground. City records and apartment managers indicate that the apartment vacancy 
rate in the San Fernando Valley has changed little since the quake, although 
damage to more than 11,000 apartments forced thousands from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The march from quake-damaged neighborhoods has been strong enough to affect 
rents. Close to the epicenter, in Northridge, Van Nuys and Reseda, rents are 
stuck at pre-quake lows and some landlords are dangling such apartment-warming 
gifts as microwaves and other incentives to attract reluctant tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Conejo Valley communities along the western leg of the Ventura Freeway, 
landlords report that quake victims have snapped up vacant apartments and rents 
are rising for the first time in years, by at least 5% in some cases, more than 
the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are coming from Chatsworth, Northridge, all over," said Michael Sigona, 
manager of a Westlake Village apartment building. "They're beating our doors 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, where nearly 60% of the population are renters, apartments are 
the bedrock of community. The Northridge quake did not simply wreck big chunks 
of residential real estate in Los Angeles and Santa Monica, but neighborhoods 
where people lived, shopped and worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "A city isn't made up of buildings, it is made up of people," said Mayor Judy 
Abdo of Santa Monica, which lost 1,500 apartments, or 5% of all apartments in 
the city. "People are our most precious resource and because of the quake they 
are not able to live here. That is devastating to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Although vacancy rates for Santa Monica are unavailable, officials say the 
city did not have enough empty apartments to house people displaced in the 
quake. Tony Trendacosta, general counsel to the rent control board, said many 
people were forced to moved outside the community, relocating in the South Bay 
or in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that many of the units were affordable, Abdo expressed concern that the 
rebuilt units will be beyond the means of displaced renters. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the apartment damage was concentrated in two areas. In Central 
Los Angeles, people were forced from 3,268 yellow- or red-tagged apartments, 
less than 1% of that area's apartment housing. In the Valley, vacated yellow- 
and red-tagged apartments accounted for 5.3% of apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst tragedy of the quake occurred when the top floors of the Northridge 
Meadows apartment building collapsed, killing 16 people who had lived on the 
first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much destruction in the area, Valley landlords anticipated a tighter 
rental market. But they now say they underestimated the fear that has caused 
many quake victims to scatter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot imagine how frightening it is," said Villa, who was thrown from 
bed by the pre-dawn earthquake in a shower of ceiling plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Her former neighbors at the apartment building on Natick Avenue, among the 
hardest hit in the city, have gone in different directions. An 82-year-old 
woman has moved in with her daughter in Tarzana. A 79-year-old woman is living 
at an Encino retirement home. Tim Gross, a 29-year-old keyboard musician, has 
moved to Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get out of there," said Gross, who commutes to gigs in the Valley 
twice a week. "I have a friend who still lives in the Valley. He's going into 
therapy; he can't take it with all the shaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Among building managers, tales of panicked tenants are legion. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen tenants fleeing a Northridge building for Simi Valley, Long Beach 
and Las Vegas in the first weeks after the quake abandoned an assortment of 
sofas, refrigerators, dishes and clothing that apartment manager Matt Mattison 
eventually tossed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took what they could and didn't come back for the rest," Mattison said. 
"They said, 'Here's my keys, here's my garage opener, I'm outta here.' All 
logic was dismissed." 
</P>
<P>
 Corea said tenants fled the third floor of a three-story apartment building 
her company owns and manages in Van Nuys. They preferred to camp in a park 
rather than rock three stories off the ground, she said. They haven't returned 
to the building, she said, although a city inspector declared it structurally 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inexplicable in some ways," said Bruce Indermall, manager of several 
buildings in the Valley. "These buildings are not red-tagged, they are not 
yellow-tagged, and they have high vacancy factors. The biggest surprise . . . 
is how much fear there is. I am not sure it is an easy situation to resolve." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics collected by the Department of Water and Power give an indication 
of post-quake apartment vacancies. One week before the quake, the DWP reported 
19,000 vacant apartments in the Valley, a vacancy rate of 9.3%. By April, 
vacancies had risen to 30,615 or 14.9% of available apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are imprecise because it appears that many badly damaged apartment 
units were counted as vacant even though they were uninhabitable. Nonetheless, 
experts say, the big rise in recorded vacancies indicates that many thousands 
of displaced tenants have not taken new apartments in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my sense that anyone who has the ability to leave the Valley is doing 
so," said Robert Starkman of the real estate consulting firm of Kenneth 
Leventhol & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with community activists and apartment managers, it is apparent 
that not all renters who leave are doing so by choice. City officials say the 
quake destroyed a big chunk of affordable housing; the average monthly rent for 
a two-bedroom unit was a manageable $640. Displaced quake victims on tight 
budgets face a difficult search. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of people still looking for affordable apartments could be sizable: 
15,000 certificates issued to quake victims for government-subsidized housing 
have not been used, and officials don't know why. They speculate that some 
landlords are reluctant to join the government program and some quake victims 
are unable to find suitable apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Affordability is not the only issue among displaced renters. Trauma caused by 
the quake has inspired requirements of apartment style and location that are 
sometimes difficult to fill. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Martinez, 38, knew what she wanted when her second-story Canoga Park 
apartment was demolished: a ground-floor apartment, private entry, plus an 
affordable rent. Martinez said she broke a rib tumbling down stairs in the 
quake; she wanted an apartment that would be easy to get out of. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, after checking nearly two dozen apartments, she chose a 
two-story, townhouse-style unit in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 How long it will take renters to resettle has become one of the great guessing 
games in local real estate. Many believe the answer has much to do with how 
long it takes to repair the damage, a constant reminder to tenants of the 
scariest seconds of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, city officials say wrecked apartment buildings lining Villa's and 
Currah's former block on Natick Avenue -- and other blocks in the city -- stand 
as open invitations to vandals and squatters whose presence is likely to drive 
tenants away. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the two-block Northridge neighborhood bordered by Roscoe Boulevard, 
Schoenborn Street, and Lindley and Zelzah avenues. One-quarter of the buildings 
are seriously damaged. Suspected gang members have turned one vacated building 
into a hangout although the owners have boarded up doors and windows to keep 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Carrasco of the city housing department said residents on the street 
have already left, some moving in with relatives, other returning to their 
native Mexico. Others have simply disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from police and city housing officials, the struggling neighborhood 
had been improving before the quake; in a cooperative spirit, landlords had 
pitched in to improve street lighting.  
</P>
<P>
 Although there are considerable pressures to rebuild quickly, history suggests 
the process will be slow. A UC Berkeley study found that less than half of 
damaged apartments were rebuilt four years after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. A 
lack of financing and inadequate insurance were major reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said apartment owners in Los Angeles face similar economic 
obstacles. Few are adequately insured. Three years of recession, marked by 
factory shutdowns and layoffs, have conspired to drive rents down.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the property consulting and investment firm of Marcus & 
Millichap, apartment buildings citywide have lost half their value since the 
market peaked in 1989. Most of the 200 apartment building sales last year 
involved a financial institution unloading a property it had foreclosed on. 
</P>
<P>
 Few investors who purchased apartments in the 1980s can borrow against them to 
fund quake repairs. That is because debt owed on those properties exceeds their 
resale value. Gary W. Squier, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of 
Housing, estimates that 20% of seriously damaged apartments will not be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard times are affecting tenants' decisions also. For Stephanie Wheeler, 26 -- 
aspiring screenwriter, Hollywood gofer and real estate school pupil -- the 
quake was the last of a series of insults suffered in recessionary Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had something going for me, I'd stay," Wheeler said, emptying the 
contents of her Sherman Oaks apartment into a rented van three weeks ago in 
preparation for the trip home to Ft. Myers, Fla. "I was planning to sell real 
estate in this neighborhood, but well, it looks like the earthquake wiped that 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 With rebuilding years away, landlords with apartments that withstood the quake 
are relying on time-honored tactics to attract and keep tenants: a month's free 
rent, free credit checks, breaks on security deposits. One Van Nuys landlord is 
offering a free microwave to people who sign a year's lease.  
</P>
<P>
 Some landlords report their methods are working, as tenants such as Marita 
Dannes return. Forced to move when her apartment building was red-tagged, 
Dannes first went to Orange County to stay with family and friends. When she 
couldn't find an affordable apartment in Brentwood or Beverly Hills, she moved 
into an apartment eight blocks from her old one in Sherman Oaks.

<P>
 As the stench of raw sewage wafts over her home, Grace Phaka knows exactly 
what she wants when the long-dreamed-for day of liberation finally arrives here 
on the edge of South Africa's oldest black township. 
</P>
<P>
 "A real toilet," she said firmly. Then she points to the outdoor tap that she 
and her husband share with 20 other families. "And clean water." 
</P>
<P>
 Their house is a two-room shanty with no windows, across from a weed-filled 
graveyard used as a trash heap and dumping ground for outhouses. "We want to 
leave the shack and get proper housing," she declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's her hope of finding a job, learning to read, getting electricity, 
leaving this grim squatter camp and finding a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no clinic, there's no school," the shy 31-year-old woman added 
softly. "Is that possible?" 
</P>
<P>
 The possibilities -- and more importantly, the needs -- seem endless here in 
Alex, as Johannesburg's only official township is called. An estimated 350,000 
blacks are crammed into a kilometer-square warren of tiny homes and hovels, 
many living in medieval squalor, less than a mile from the city's most opulent 
white suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidden from whites behind an imposing fence dubbed the "Berlin Wall," violent 
crime and unemployment are soaring. Tuberculosis and other infectious diseases 
are endemic. Schooling has largely collapsed, and hundreds of families have 
lost loved ones to factional fighting in a neighborhood so bloody it is called 
"Beirut." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex is a microcosm of black South Africa, so what happens here will be key to 
judging the success or failure of the policies of Nelson Mandela's African 
National Congress if, as expected, that party sweeps the national and 
provincial elections next week to become the first black-led government in the 
nation's troubled history. 
</P>
<P>
 Many blacks have great expectations, while many whites have great fears. 
Balancing the two may be Mandela's biggest challenge, especially since the odds 
for success, some say, are slim. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC plans an ambitious program of reconstruction and development aimed at 
areas such as Alex. Over the next five years, according to the latest draft of 
a still-evolving agenda, the ANC promises to build at least 1 million houses 
with sanitary facilities, electrify 2.5 million homes, create 2.5 million jobs 
in a public works program, and provide children with free health care and 10 
years of free compulsory primary schooling, among other pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Manuel, the ANC's chief economist, puts the cost of the five-year 
program at about $11.5 billion, with a target of $2.6 billion the first year. 
But he promises the money will come from squeezing savings and redirecting 
existing allocations in the $34-billion annual budget rather than from raising 
taxes or borrowing money. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need higher taxes," he said. "You don't need an increased budget. 
You need far greater efficiency in the way money is spent." 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel argues, for example, that the new government can slash the $3.1-billion 
defense budget. Other savings can be found, he said, by consolidating the 14 
education departments set up under apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need a single education department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another target, he said, is $1.1 billion in what he scorns as "apartheid 
infrastructure," including lavish embassies maintained in London and Paris by 
the now-defunct homeland of Bophuthatswana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't say we can solve all this overnight," Manuel added. "But these are 
reasonable targets." 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists, business people and diplomats, however, are dubious. Even ANC 
supporters fear that the program is more a wish list of social goals than a 
hard outline of budgets and schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "The price tags are something short of meaningless," said a sympathetic 
Western economist here who has studied the ANC proposals. "It's difficult to 
see how all this is going to happen, partly because the ANC has not spelled out 
how it's going to happen. . . . There is no real economic data on what each 
program will cost, let alone whether it can be carried out." 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics warn that much of the promised post-apartheid savings may be as 
elusive as the so-called peace dividend has been in the United States since the 
end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense cuts here, for example, will be partly offset by training, outfitting 
and deployment of the new 4,500-member National Peacekeeping Force, the new 
army of former black guerrillas and South African soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 And efficiencies may be elusive. For example, the new country will have nine 
provinces, not four, so an infrastructure to support new capitals and 
departments will be required. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC has repeatedly pledged to pay salaries and pensions for the 1.7 
million civil servants, as well as create 2.5 million jobs. Then there's the 
party's commitment to affirmative action. So cutting payrolls will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Keys, the finance minister in the lame-duck government of President 
Frederik W. de Klerk, warns that the ANC program is "not responsible" and can't 
be achieved in less than 10 to 15 years. The Development Bank of Southern 
Africa has given a similar assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There certainly will be a great many very disappointed people," Keys said. 
"The delivery system will not be adequate." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, the government built about 20,000 low-cost homes -- 
far fewer than its budget called for -- blaming violence in the townships. 
Building 10 times that number each year will not be easy, even if peace breaks 
out. For one thing, not enough contractors and builders exist in the townships 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Electricity may be the easiest service to deliver. The country has a surplus, 
and Eskom, the self-financed national utility, has said providing power to 2.5 
million homes is possible providing it can raise the money on international 
markets. An Eskom official has already moved to London to seek financing. 
</P>
<P>
 And the ANC hopes that millions of blacks who protested apartheid by refusing 
to pay taxes or for such services as electricity will pay their fair share. But 
economists warn that projecting spending on improved tax collection is a 
dubious way to plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, there is the harder question of how quickly an untested ANC 
government, largely led by people who spent decades in exile or prison, can 
master the sheer morass of bureaucratic and economic challenges that lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC officials insist that the promises can -- and will -- be kept to match 
fast-rising expectations. Apartheid's systematic racial segregation in 
everything from education to employment has left 17 million people, in a 
population of 40 million, in extreme poverty. An estimated 12 million have no 
access to clean drinking water, 7 million are homeless, and millions more live 
without decent schools, basic health care or real jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be able to deliver in a significant way," said Willie Hofmeyr, an 
ANC strategist. "If, after five years (when another election will be held), we 
have empty hands and broken promises, we'll have very big problems from the 
left." 
</P>
<P>
 ANC information chief Pallo Jordan agreed. "The price of failure would be a 
curse to South Africa. If you can't place goods of freedom in the form of 
housing and so on before the people, you won't have stability. In the absence 
of stability, you jeopardize democracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eugene Nyati, an analyst at the independent Center for African Studies 
here, believes that the ANC will win a lengthy honeymoon after it takes office. 
He says most poor blacks are voting for liberation, not instant material goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "This election is not about issues," he said. "It's about symbolism, history 
and race." 
</P>
<P>
 But some issues may cause problems. Land is especially sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites have forced blacks from their homes and land since colonial times. The 
evictions accelerated after 1948, when the National Party invented apartheid. 
Millions of families were dumped in desolate reservations called homelands. 
Others were bulldozed out of their homes and trucked to crowded townships under 
a policy that removed "black spots" from "white areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Whites now control 87% of the land, including farms that produce nearly all 
the food. The ANC has taken pains to reassure nervous whites that their 
property is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's land will be forcibly taken away from them," said Jay Naidoo, who is 
in charge of the ANC reconstruction plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ANC also promises to redistribute 30% of the agricultural land to the 
dispossessed within five years. Land courts will adjudicate claims for those 
displaced under apartheid, government land will be distributed, and other 
property will be bought at market value, Naidoo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aninka Claasen, a land policy expert formerly with the Center for Applied 
Legal Studies here, says the program is unworkable. A last-minute change in the 
new constitution guarantees rights of existing land owners and limits legal 
expropriation of land only to such public uses as roads, dams and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you not take away anyone's land, yet redistribute a third of the 
land?" she asked. "It's a contradiction. . . . The first expropriation of land 
will be challenged as unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
 Other contradictions abound. Once famed for its Communist-inspired populist 
rhetoric, the ANC's official goal now is a Keynesian free-market economy with a 
strong state role, not unlike social democratic governments in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the election nears, Mandela, the former Marxist revolutionary, has 
publicly pleaded with the country's leftist trade unions -- who are among his 
most fervent backers -- to resist strikes and other militant job actions that 
helped propel him to power. 
</P>
<P>
 At an appearance Friday at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the world's 10th 
largest, Mandela pledged to "restore economic stability" after the election. He 
promised it would be built on "sound market principles," with development 
driven by economic growth and an open door to foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at our program, there's not a single sentence about 
nationalization," Mandela said, hoping to reassure nervous business executives 
and investors here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the 147-page ANC plan does refer to nationalization as one of 
several potential ways to "increase the public sector in strategic areas." But 
Manuel and other top ANC leaders insist that the ANC has no plans to take over 
lucrative gold and diamond mines, or other industries.  
</P>
<P>
 High finance, of course, is a long way from the hard times and tin-topped 
shanties of Alex. Here, hidden in a hollow close by the richest residential 
belt in all Africa, the concerns are far more basic. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the adults do not have jobs, so knots of men spend their days drinking 
beer and playing checkers. Most children never attend the overcrowded schools, 
which usually lack books and equipment. The poorest area is the graveside 
squatter camp known as Stjwetla, where hovels are jammed together in a 
patchwork of packing crates, tin and broken bricks. 
</P>
<P>
 In one shack, 55-year-old Sina Mogolapa stood in a torn housedress under a low 
tin ceiling with plastic bags jammed in cracks to keep out the rain. The tin 
house is an oven in summer, a freezer in winter. The front room has a grate but 
no chimney, so it fills with smoke if Mogolapa lights a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no electricity, but a small TV is wired to a car battery. One 
daughter works, and another goes to school. It costs nearly $15, a fortune 
here, to take a taxi to the nearest medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't got any money," Mogolapa said. "Nothing, really." 
</P>
<P>
 But her hopes are high as she prepares to vote for the first time next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps after the elections we will see some changes," she said with a smile. 
"Perhaps we'll see a little help from the ANC."

CLINTON NAMES 2 ECONOMISTS TO FED BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton filled two vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board Friday, 
appointing White House economist Alan Blinder as vice chairman and UC Berkeley 
economist Janet Yellen to a second seat on the Fed's seven-member board of 
governors. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder and Yellen would be the first Democratic appointees to the board since 
1980. Moreover, the appointments could give Clinton a chance to influence 
interest rate policies at the nation's central bank, which uses interest rates 
to regulate the pace of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder, 48, a former Princeton economist who has played a key role in 
virtually every aspect of Clinton Administration economic policy, appears to be 
the odds-on favorite to succeed Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan when his term 
expires in March, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely anticipated appointments come at a crucial time for relations 
between the Fed and the White House. The Fed, still dominated by Republican 
appointees, including Greenspan, has raised interest rates three times since 
February and seems certain to raise them further in coming months to combat 
what it perceives as the threat of future inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration, while refraining from directly criticizing Fed policy, 
still argues that there is no sign that inflation is getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing together at a White House press briefing, both Blinder and Yellen 
declined to comment on Fed policy, arguing that they will wait to discuss their 
views until their confirmation hearings before the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's financial markets have been fearful that Clinton would try to 
pack the Fed with advocates of easy money policies who would allow inflation to 
go unchecked. For that reason, the Administration's nominees appear to be wary 
of making any statements that could roil Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
 Yellen, 47, is a former Fed and Harvard economist with broad interests, 
ranging from the behavior of youth gangs to the dynamics of labor markets. She 
described herself to reporters as a "non-ideological pragmatist." 
</P>
<P>
 As a faculty member at UC Berkeley, she had been a colleague of fellow 
Berkeley economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who was chosen by Clinton to serve as 
chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Tyson, in fact, was 
deeply involved in the selection process for filling the Fed vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellen, who would succeed Republican Wayne Angell on the board, also fulfills 
the Administration's desire to name a woman or a minority to offset the 
appointment of Blinder, a white male, to be Fed vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder, a longtime friend and classmate of Tyson's at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, has served as her principal deputy at the CEA since 
the beginning of the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In past comments, Blinder has made it clear that he shares the 
Administration's view that inflation is not as big a threat as the Fed's 
leadership believes. As vice chairman, he would succeed David Mullins, a George 
Bush Administration appointee who resigned in February.  
</P>
<P>
 Blinder not only would bring the voice of the Administration to the Fed, he 
would also bring a baby boomer sensibility to one of the most staid and 
convention-laden institutions in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 When his appointment was announced at the White House by Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen, Blinder stepped to the microphone and quoted Monty Python, the 
British comedy troupe that developed a cult following in the United States in 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "In thinking about this change in positions from the CEA to the Federal 
Reserve over the last few days or even weeks, I can't get the Monty Python line 
out of my head: 'And now for something completely different,' " Blinder said. 
"It will be different in many, many ways, not the least of which is that the 
role of the CEA, as all of you know, is entirely advisory. At the Federal 
Reserve, I will be getting advice from all quarters of society all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that they have not ruled out the prospect of 
reappointing Greenspan to a third term as Fed chairman. Greenspan was 
originally appointed chairman in 1987 by Ronald Reagan -- succeeding Paul A. 
Volcker, one of the most powerful Fed chairmen in history. He was reappointed 
in 1991 by Bush, but his second four-year term did not begin until 1992, when 
Congress finally approved his appointment.

NATO ISSUES ULTIMATUM TO SERBS RINGING ENCLAVE; BOSNIA: ALLIANCE THREATENS AIR 
STRIKES UNLESS REBELS WITHDRAW 2 MILES FROM GORAZDE'S CENTER BY 3 P.M. TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reacting to mounting international outrage, the NATO alliance Friday delivered 
an ultimatum to Bosnian Serb forces to stop their attacks on the besieged city 
of Gorazde or face immediate air strikes against a range of military targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation demands action," NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of civilians have died in recent days as the defenseless city -- one 
of six areas in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina that the United Nations declared 
"safe havens" -- has been subjected to relentless Serbian artillery, mortar and 
tank bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 That shelling continued Friday for hours beyond announcement of the NATO 
ultimatum, killing 99 people and wounding nearly 300, according to trapped city 
officials and relief workers communicating via ham radios. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, Yasushi Akashi, U.N. special envoy to the former Yugoslav 
federation, said the Serbs had agreed to a cease-fire around Gorazde beginning 
at noon today (3 a.m. Pacific time). But dozens of such agreements have gone 
unfulfilled or lasted mere minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the immediate cease-fire, ambassadors to the 16-nation North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization also demanded: 
</P>
<P>
 * That all Bosnian Serb forces withdraw at least 1.9 miles from the Gorazde 
city center by one minute past midnight Sunday morning local time (3:01 p.m. 
today Pacific time). Failure to do so could prompt a NATO attack. 
</P>
<P>
 * That a 12-mile military exclusion zone from the Gorazde city center be 
established by one minute past midnight Wednesday morning (3:01 p.m. Tuesday 
Pacific time). Any heavy weapons remaining in this zone would be subject to air 
strikes. (A small section of Serbia proper that lies within the 12-mile zone 
was specifically excluded, however.) 
</P>
<P>
 * That U.N. peacekeeping forces, humanitarian relief convoys and medical 
assistance teams be able to enter Gorazde unimpeded and that medical 
evacuations are permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO also declared that, effective immediately, firing by Bosnian Serb forces 
into four other U.N.-designated safe areas -- Bihac, Srebrenica, Tuzla and Zepa 
-- or any massing of troops within a 12-mile radius of those cities would 
automatically make the areas military exclusion zones, exposing Bosnian Serb 
weapons and other military assets there to air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the measures "some of the most far-reaching decisions in the history 
of our alliance," Woerner warned that "it is now up to the Bosnia Serbs to heed 
these demands or face the most serious consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 Wording of the ultimatum, which threatens air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
"heavy weapons and other military targets" within Gorazde's exclusion zone, 
constitutes both a significant broadening of NATO options for military action 
in Bosnia and, at least potentially, a deeper involvement in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The language would also appear to give the alliance a degree of the 
flexibility it had wanted in order to attack a variety of Bosnian Serb targets, 
including ammunition dumps, military command posts and communications centers 
in addition to the weapons themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, NATO air strikes in Bosnia have been limited to attacks on specific 
Bosnian Serb heavy weapons that have threatened U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not tit-for-tat targeting," U.S. Ambassador to NATO Robert Hunter 
said. "There's a broader targeting set now than before. Just about anything 
that has a war-making potential is in my mind fair game." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the alliance failed in its attempts to streamline an unwieldy chain 
of command that in the past has required such intense coordination with the 
United Nations that it has become an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 While the commander of NATO forces in Southern Europe, U.S. Adm. Leighton 
Smith, can now initiate a call for attacks on Bosnian Serb targets in the 
Gorazde area from his headquarters in Naples, Italy, he must have the agreement 
of the commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, to do so. And 
Rose, a Briton, cannot act without permission of U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali's special envoy, Akashi. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance last month, more than five hours elapsed from the time a group 
of French U.N. peacekeepers requested NATO air support to the time 
authorization was finally received from Akashi. By then, poor visibility 
prevented the air attack. NATO officials later said their aircraft could have 
reacted within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, both Pentagon and State Department officials expressed 
confidence Friday that the chain of command would not impede rapid response. 
Pentagon officials said they expected Boutros-Ghali would explicitly approve 
the first air strike and that after that, NATO forces would have the latitude 
to pursue operations without such explicit approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no reason to believe there will be any difference of opinion" between 
Boutros-Ghali and NATO planners, one Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said more than 200 NATO aircraft are ready to carry out the 
alliance's new threats "at any time." The U.S. carrier Saratoga, with 18 
warplanes, is in the Adriatic Sea, and 40 other warplanes, ranging from F-15E 
Strike Eagles to the venerable O/A-10 attack aircraft, are scattered throughout 
Europe within striking distance of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 But a senior U.S. military official warned that any air attacks will likely 
exact a toll on NATO air crews. Unlike the situation around Sarajevo, he said, 
potential Bosnian Serb targets around Gorazde are scattered throughout 
populated and built-up areas and are frequently hidden under low cloud cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means you have to get fairly close to your business," he said, adding that 
NATO air crews will be more vulnerable to antiaircraft fire. Bosnian Serb 
forces shot down a British Harrier jet last weekend with a heat-seeking 
missile. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, described the Gorazde ultimatum as a U.S. 
idea that was sold to the United States' allies within the course of prolonged 
meetings Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a Clinton initiative, not a NATO initiative," Hunter said. "We 
brought it in at 9 o'clock this morning and by 6, we had gotten agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, officials said that some in the Administration had wanted to 
authorize air strikes against strategic targets anywhere in Bosnia. Officials 
said the Europeans insisted that they be limited to targets directly involved 
in attacks on safe areas. But they did allow for the possibility of gradual 
escalation of the target list. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 15,000 peacekeeping troops on the ground there," a European 
diplomat in Washington said. "The nightmare for all the countries that have 
sent them is to find that they have been turned into targets, whether of 
snipers or hostage-taking." 
</P>
<P>
 Nations with U.N. peacekeepers on the ground, including France, Britain and 
Canada, were reportedly reluctant to give NATO more freedom from U.N. control 
in determining specific targets and the timing of attacks.  
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs have threatened reprisals against these peacekeepers if NATO 
follows through with threats to intensify its air attacks. Friday, they blocked 
a U.N. convoy from returning to Sarajevo after it had failed to reach Gorazde 
on Thursday; 141 U.N. peacekeepers were thus vulnerable to being taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and British officials said they were withdrawing nonessential personnel 
and diplomats' families from their embassies in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, 
for fear of possible reprisals.  
</P>
<P>
 Hunter said Clinton decided late Thursday to press the ultimatum after 
Administration officials believed that Bosnian Serb forces were accelerating 
their bombardment of Gorazde in an attempt to capture the city before NATO 
could formally respond to Boutros-Ghali's latest request for alliance help. 
</P>
<P>
 That request, contained in a letter last Monday, was carefully restricted to 
attacks on Bosnian Serb heavy weapons firing into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ultimatum, however, draws on an earlier NATO mandate given last 
August to act to prevent the strangulation of six safe areas and wide-scale 
interference with humanitarian assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second such set of demands issued by NATO to Bosnian Serb forces 
this year and is modeled after the initial one, made last Feb. 9, which brought 
about a cease-fire and a 12-mile exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital, 
Sarajevo, also a designated safe area. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the Bosnian Serbs have respected the Sarajevo ultimatum, and a 
shaky peace has held there for the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ultimatum appeared to run the risk of straining ties between Russia 
and the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Woerner said Moscow was also immediately informed of the NATO ultimatum, and 
he stressed the need for Russian involvement in any negotiated settlement of 
the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted consultations between Russian and some NATO member states during 
the run-up to Friday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, speaking Friday before NATO 
ambassadors reached a decision, warned that NATO air strikes would simply 
escalate the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NATO decision, if it is adopted, will exceed the limits of the broadest 
interpretations of the U.N. Security Council resolutions," he said. "We have 
not done everything to help the Serb side make a choice in favor of peaceful 
settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Russian diplomat, Grigory Karasin, announced that Russia was ready to 
withdraw its U.N.-controlled peacekeeping troops from Bosnia if they become 
endangered by new NATO air strikes. He did not make it clear whether Russia 
might act unilaterally in such a pullout.

Moscow, contributed to this report.

EUROPE; BRITAIN'S LAVISH D-DAY PLANS LEAD TO BID TO CALL IT ALL OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suddenly the long-heralded 50th anniversary of D-day has become as 
controversial a political issue in Britain as it has elsewhere in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 After investing millions of dollars and thousands of hours of planning and 
preparation to commemorate the Allied invasion of France on June 6, 1944, many 
voices here are suggesting: Let's call the whole thing off. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition Labor and Liberal parties say ceremonies that should 
commemorate the servicemen who died on that fateful day have been turned into a 
celebratory circus by the Conservative government. 
</P>
<P>
 They claim that the anniversary, which will involve thousands of Americans, is 
being hijacked by the faltering government of Prime Minister John Major to 
capitalize on patriotic good feeling shortly before local and Europarliament 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The British Defense Ministry's initial position was: Nothing special for D-day 
but a big effort next year for V-E (Victory in Europe) Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Major, alert to the potential political gain, overruled this view and 
preparations proceeded apace, some involving the Americans, Britons and 
Canadians who landed on the Normandy beaches 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to have ceremonies with 13 heads of state and government from the 
Allied nations that participated in "Operation Overlord," as the invasion was 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourist boards on both sides of the English Channel, imagining hotels and 
restaurants full and cash registers ringing, joined in to lure veterans and 
their relatives to the scene of the event that led to the end of World War II 
and the restoration of democracy in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Ministry was assigned to handle military activities: parades, 
flyovers, fleet reviews, military museum exhibitions. The Heritage Ministry 
would supervise the civilian side of the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 local events have now been planned in Britain alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But somewhere along the way, planners got carried away with street parties and 
booze fests in pubs -- in short, a national celebration to mark the 
anniversary, and thereby remind the world of Britain at its best. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few days, a deep reaction set in, perhaps triggered by the 
announcement that the government would sponsor a huge jamboree in London's Hyde 
Park that seemed to have little to do with D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 The British Legion, a leading veterans group, and the Normandy Veterans' Assn. 
vehemently objected to Major's description of "celebrations" rather than 
"commemorations" to remember the thousands killed and wounded in the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The veterans particularly objected to the Hyde Park hoopla, and in their cause 
they enlisted Dame Vera Lynn, a sweetheart singer who enchanted lonely World 
War II servicemen with "We'll Meet Again." 
</P>
<P>
 Late this week, after the matter was raised in an argumentative House of 
Commons, the government belatedly agreed to solicit advice from veterans groups 
on how best to observe D-day. Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke, at Major's 
insistence, gave a series of interviews in which he stressed the commemorative 
nature of the events. 
</P>
<P>
 And Eddy Hannath, general secretary of the Normandy Veterans' Assn., said, "We 
are happier now than we were last week." 
</P>
<P>
 In a public opinion poll published Friday, 65% of those questioned said street 
parties and fireworks displays would trivialize the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll also showed that one in three did not know what happened June 6, 
1944.

SOUTH AMERICA; CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM FLICKERS OUT IN BRAZIL; DEADLINE NEARS FOR 
FINAL REVIEW OF THE DOCUMENT'S 245 ARTICLES. IN NEARLY SEVEN MONTHS, LAWMAKERS 
HAVE PASSED FOUR REFORMS.

<P>
 One day early this month, in a silent hall of Congress, Inocencio de Oliveira, 
president of Brazil's Chamber of Deputies, saw the electronic panel that 
registers the congressional head count flashing bad news. The deadline for 
revising Brazil's constitution was approaching, and once again there would be 
no quorum that day in Brasilia, the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reform is dead," Oliveira said before a gallery of empty seats. "It's 
just a matter of burying it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Brazil became independent in 1822, the highest law in the land has been 
redone seven times. The latest constitution, written in 1988, was supposed to 
be different. It righted many wrongs, burying the fiat of earlier regimes by 
strengthening Congress and restoring power and revenue to neglected states and 
towns. It addressed the need for food for the hungry, work for the unemployed 
and shelter for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The constitution promised so much -- "heaven on earth," one former minister 
was fond of saying -- that it became almost impossible to implement. But the 
1988 legislature had thought to include a safety valve: a clause to hold the 
document, with its 245 articles, up for review in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 That review was launched, as planned, last October. It was scrapped, for all 
practical purposes, last week, a victim of the fractious politics that only a 
thorough review might have mended. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that legislators didn't try. When Congressman Nelson Jobim, the rapporteur 
of the review process, opened the first reform session, he had a startling 
17,000 amendments on his desk. But many of Jobim's colleagues were put off by 
his brusque, arbitrary ways. They blocked the review with stonewalling tactics 
or merely by staying away. 
</P>
<P>
 The parties of the left, led by Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's Workers' Party, 
would hear no talk of dismantling state-run enterprises or reversing the social 
welfare benefits they authored in 1988. The right wing did its best to do just 
that, arguing that such policies are driving Brasilia to bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Many politicians were preoccupied during the reform process by the drawn-out 
investigations into corruption in the legislature. Many more were distracted by 
their own campaigns for the Oct. 3 general elections. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, in close to seven months, four amendments passed the obligatory 
two rounds of votes. Most dealt with minor matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of things undone is enormous. The political system remains lopsided, 
for example. There are 19 political parties represented in Congress, and 
electoral rules give legislators from small states proportionately far more 
power than those from large ones. This often leaves the president hostage to 
the demands of tiny parties and states. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still a few working days left for Congress before the revision 
deadline expires May 31. But no one believes that Congress can, or should, try 
to do in a few sessions the job it has neglected for half a year. Instead, 
Oliveira and Jobim are pushing to delay the review until after the October 
elections. Most of the benefits of a new charter would not take effect until 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 A delay could be costly. The social welfare system is hemorrhaging money. New 
investment is hamstrung by constitutional restrictions on foreign capital. And 
while lawmakers in 1988 proudly reserved "strategic" sectors such as mining, 
petroleum and telecommunications for the state, these sectors are now broke. 
</P>
<P>
 "The delayed reform is bad news for the longer-term health of the economic 
plan," said Walder de Goes, a Brazilian political scientist. "And each plan 
that fails is one more reason for the people not to believe the next one." 
Halting Reform 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly seven months, Brazil's Congress has passed four items of 
constitutional reform: 
</P>
<P>
 The social emergency fund, a $16-billion account that gives Brasilia the 
flexibility to pay its bills without printing money and driving up inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 An amendment giving Congress more powers to summon Cabinet ministers for 
interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
 An 18-month suspension of the political rights of ministers caught abusing the 
powers of their office. 
</P>
<P>
 A law allowing Brazilian citizens with foreign passports the right to dual 
citizenship.

FARRAKHAN ADMITS SPREADING IDEAS THAT LED TO MALCOLM X'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan says Malcolm X would be "so much more 
valuable" were he alive today, but admits helping create "the atmosphere" that 
encouraged assassins to kill the Muslim activist. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview that aired Friday night on ABC-TV's "20/20," Farrakhan said he 
was angry with Malcolm X for splitting with Nation of Islam founder Elijah 
Muhammad and publicly criticizing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very angry with Malcolm for what Malcolm had done. I was hurt by his 
assassination," Farrakhan said. " . . . But today, looking back, Malcolm would 
be so much more valuable to us alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm X's widow, Betty Shabazz, said recently that she believes Farrakhan 
had some role in her husband's murder in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan denied that, but admitted fueling anti-Malcolm sentiment with an 
article published in Muhammad Speaks, the Nation of Islam's newspaper, shortly 
before the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 That article said, in part: "The die is set and Malcolm shall not escape. Such 
a man as Malcolm is worthy of death." 
</P>
<P>
 "Betty Shabazz never said that Farrakhan was a plotter in the death of 
Malcolm. But she said that Farrakhan helped to create the atmosphere," he said. 
"And that I can agree with." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan also said he stands by "truths" about Jews articulated by his former 
national assistant, Khallid Muhammad. Muhammad was denounced for a speech in 
which he called Jews "bloodsuckers of the black community," and Farrakhan 
removed him from his job.

GERMAN POLICE CRACK A CURIOUS MICKEY MOUSE CASE; CRIME: EXTORTIONIST WENT BY 
THE NAME SCROOGE MCDUCK. HE HAD BAFFLED AUTHORITIES -- AND DELIGHTED SOME 
GERMANS -- WITH HIS WITTY ESCAPADES FOR TWO YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police closed a chapter in the annals of German crime Friday with the capture 
of a mysterious, bomb-making extortionist who went by the remarkable nom de 
guerre of "Dagobert" -- German for Scrooge McDuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagobert had plagued German authorities -- and entertained ordinary Germans -- 
for nearly two years, with capers ranging from the deployment of a homemade, 
remote-controlled rail car for picking up ransom money to police chases through 
the sewers of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagobert was a high-tech extortionist, who specialized in inventing zany 
electronic devices to collect money from his department store targets at 
pre-selected drop sites. European comics buffs had speculated that he was 
taking his ideas from the exploits of Scrooge McDuck, Donald Duck's tightfisted 
trillionaire uncle, drawn by the Disney artist Carl Barks. Police investigators 
reportedly combed about 6,000 pages of Barks' cartoon strips in their search 
for clues. 
</P>
<P>
 More seriously, the extortionist set off five explosions at branches of the 
Karstadt department store chain, causing about $6 million worth of damage. No 
one was seriously injured, but police had warned that it was only a matter of 
time before an explosion maimed or killed somebody. The bomber had promised to 
stop the attacks if Karstadt paid him about $825,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Police identified their suspect Friday as Arno Funke, a 44-year-old unemployed 
sign-painter from what used to be West Berlin, who is married and the father of 
a 3-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Funke confessed immediately when they captured him, while he was 
calling a Karstadt store from a pay phone in what used to be East Berlin. They 
also said they believe that he was behind an earlier, successful extortion of 
about $300,000 from the KaDeWe department store, Berlin's largest, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, police had fumbled through more than 30 attempts to capture 
Dagobert at the various money-drops he proposed, at a cost to taxpayers that 
was rumored to be as high as $20 million. They collected about 3,000 leads, 
questioned more than 100 suspects and put trained dogs, anti-terrorist squads, 
helicopters, psychics and even astrologers on the case. They offered a $60,000 
reward for information and set up a telephone line on which potential tipsters 
could listen to Dagobert's voice on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Daleki, the Hamburg police officer who orchestrated the hunt, told the 
magazine Stern in February that the case was the most difficult of his career. 
He admitted that he had even started dreaming about Dagobert at night. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that despite his frustration, he still found himself able to 
laugh at Dagobert. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was much to laugh at: In one typical episode, for instance, Berlin 
police staked out 2,000 downtown Berlin credit-card phone booths -- the 
technology-loving Dagobert was believed to favor credit-card calls -- only to 
be foiled when the bomber called in from a coin-operated pay phone in the 
suburbs -- across the street from the Walt Disney School. 
</P>
<P>
 Such whimsy, as well as the massive scope of the hunt, fascinated Germans, 
some of whom took to sporting T-shirts with the legend, "I am Dagobert." A 
telephone survey by a German broadcaster found that 61% of callers harbored 
"hidden sympathy" for the bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagobert has been the subject of television shows, movie scripts, a novel, a 
popular song and a radio quiz show. There are even Dagobert garden gnomes, with 
face mask and a bundle of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are fascinated," said Hans-Joachim Aust, a member of DONALD, a society 
of comic book aficionados whose name is the German acronym for the Organization 
of Non-Commercial Supporters of Donaldism. "There is always this kind of effect 
when there's a clever guy who's always outwitting the police."  
</P>
<P>
 For all his inventiveness, Dagobert was never able to collect any money from 
Karstadt. In some instances his devices broke down in mid-collection. In 
others, he failed to show up -- lapses for which he would later send polite 
notes of explanation. Other times he played cat-and-mouse with the police, 
showing up at drop sites but disappearing penniless down manholes. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest, Funke said he had been having a bad day: "I was a bit in 
stress, so I became a bit careless," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Aust: "I wish, somehow, that he had just gotten away with the money and 
vanished. Now it turns out he is just an ordinary human being, who makes 
mistakes like everyone else. The legend is gone."

HATA TO NAME CABINET, PUT EMPHASIS ON 1994 BUDGET; JAPAN: AFTER MEETING OF 
PARTY CHIEFS, THE OUTGOING HOSOKAWA ADMITS FAILING TO REPORT $276,000 IN 
INCOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Party leaders of Japan's ruling coalition on Friday officially chose Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata to be their candidate for prime minister to replace 
Morihiro Hosokawa, who admitted that he failed to report $276,000 in income to 
tax authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, 58, who is expected to win an election Monday for the nation's top 
political post, said he wanted to mold Japan into "a country in which everyone 
can live at ease and make a living, a country which, in international society, 
is trusted, understood and loved." 
</P>
<P>
 Chosen after 14 days of bitter struggling to hammer out a platform for the new 
government, Hata said he will name his Cabinet on Monday and place priority on 
enacting the fiscal 1994 budget, deliberations on which already are three 
months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nikkei News Service, quoting an anonymous Foreign Ministry official, 
reported that Hata will visit Italy, France and Germany May 3-7, a period that 
includes three Japanese holidays, to consult with their leaders before the July 
summit of seven advanced industrial democracies in Naples, Italy. Hosokawa had 
been scheduled to make the trip before he announced his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, who was bedeviled by squabbling within the coalition, offered Hata 
both congratulations and thanks in advance for taking on what he called 
"ordeals" that lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting of party chiefs, Hosokawa spoke about his failure to report 
the $276,000 in income. He called it an unintentional oversight. His chief 
secretary, Namio Yatsuka, said in a news conference that the income was 
received over a 10-year period beginning in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hosokawa surprised the nation April 8 by declaring he would resign, he 
cited as his main reason what he called a new discovery of financial dealings 
tainted by "suspicions of illegality." But until Friday, he had provided no 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa said he had been unaware of how his staff had handled profits from 
investments in stocks made on his behalf by a friend who was an investment 
consultant. His staff, he said, mistakenly believed that profits on investments 
from personal funds were not subject to tax if spent as political funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Yatsuka said he had informed Hosokawa of the office's mistake the night before 
the prime minister announced that he would resign to accept "moral 
responsibility" for the affair. The secretary added that Hosokawa's office will 
now report the income and pay penalty taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The statute of limitations on prosecution of tax evasion has already expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition Liberal Democrat lawmakers said they will continue to pursue 
information about two other Hosokawa deals -- a $952,000 loan that Hosokawa 
admitted receiving in 1982 and the purchase in 1986 of $4 million worth of 
shares in Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. in the name of his father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 In his resignation speech, Hosokawa admitted that he had incorrectly stated 
that he had paid interest on the loan. But he insisted that he was innocent of 
any wrongdoing involving the loan or the stock purchase. The unpaid interest, 
estimated at $285,714, had been reported "properly" as a political 
contribution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa said Friday that he will retain his seat in the lower house of 
Parliament and continue serving as head of the Japan New Party that he founded 
two years ago.

FEELING LEFT OUT OF LOOP, S. KOREAN PREMIER RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hoi Chang resigned Friday, reportedly angered 
at being left out of important decisions in the effort to ease tensions with 
North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 President Kim Young Sam promptly replaced him with Lee Young Duk, who as 
unification minister oversees the government's North Korea policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister has limited powers in South Korea's system, but the 
resignation after just five months in office could damage Kim's standing. Lee, 
a former judge respected for his integrity and outspokenness, led a sweeping 
anti-corruption drive that is a cornerstone of Kim's administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-government groups criticized the loss of Lee, calling it a setback to the 
drive to root out corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation comes as Kim's government tries to improve relations with 
North Korea. Tensions have been high in the region because of suspicions the 
north is developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In appointing his unification chief as prime minister, Kim was seen as 
signaling his approval of current North Korea policy, including a major 
concession to North Korea a week ago in which South Korea dropped a demand for 
an exchange of envoys with North Korea as a condition for the resumption of 
U.S. diplomatic efforts to settle the nuclear issue. North Korea is believed to 
be seeking to open ties with the United States and other Western nations 
because of its economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Press reports said Lee was dismayed that important decisions, such as dropping 
the envoy exchange, were made without consulting him. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidential spokesman Choo Don Shik quoted Lee as saying he quit because he 
could not lead a divided Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters, Lee declined to explain his resignation. He said he had 
no immediate plans and wanted to rest.

CHINA GIVES DETAILS OF BOAT MURDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China gave its first detailed account Friday of how 24 Taiwanese tourists were 
murdered on a pleasure boat March 31, saying they were robbed and then burned 
to death by three men carrying hunting guns and an ax. 
</P>
<P>
 The account carried by the New China News Agency and on national TV news 
followed charges by Taiwan that the Chinese were trying to cover up the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has caused great friction between the rival governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The news agency reported that the three, traveling in a motor boat, boarded 
the tourist boat after dark as it sailed on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang province. 
They threatened the crew with weapons before robbing the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The pirates forced the tourists into the boat's cabin and then set the craft 
on fire despite promises not to hurt them. All the Taiwanese tourists and eight 
mainland Chinese crew were killed, the news agency said.

U.S. COOL TO N. KOREA'S A-PLANT PROPOSAL; DIPLOMACY: PERRY SAYS OFFER TO ALLOW 
INSPECTORS TO MONITOR REFUELING AT NUCLEAR REACTOR DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States reacted cautiously Friday to North Korea's offer to allow 
international inspectors to monitor the refueling of its Yongbyon reactor, 
saying it was not clear they would get enough access to tell whether Pyongyang 
is building nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference Friday, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said the 
North Korean proposal did not spell out important details about what kinds of 
conditions might be imposed on the inspectors, such as whether they could take 
test samples of the spent fuel rods. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer came in a letter from Pyongyang to the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, which conducts the inspections. Agency experts said Friday that they 
were discussing the offer with North Korean officials over the next few days to 
iron out the details. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in another move in its long-running cat-and-mouse game with the West 
over the nuclear issue, Pyongyang said it plans to refuel its reactor in May, 
about two months earlier than expected. Refueling is a critical operation in 
producing weapons-grade plutonium.  
</P>
<P>
 The mid-May refueling is expected to heighten pressure on the West, and could 
derail a crucial report that the IAEA was scheduled to issue at about that time 
declaring once and for all whether Pyongyang is complying with its 
nuclear-inspection obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We regard that as a step in the wrong direction," Perry told a press 
conference in Japan after a week's visit to discuss the situation in North 
Korea with his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo. He returned to Washington late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said it was critical that the IAEA inspectors be permitted to sample and 
test the fuel rods that are removed from the reactor because that is the only 
way they can measure the radioactivity of the spent fuel and determine whether 
it is being recycled for atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very clear that the IAEA believes that you need more than just physical 
presence in Yongbyon," the site of the reactor, for it to carry out its 
inspections properly, he told a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said reprocessing the spent fuel into plutonium, using facilities that 
North Korea already has constructed, could provide enough fissionable material 
to manufacture between four and five nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense chief warned that unless North Korea gives IAEA inspectors the 
free rein they need by the time it begins removing the spent fuel from its 
reactor, the United States, Japan and South Korea will press for imposition of 
economic sanctions by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said that if the Security Council turns down such a request, the allies 
might well act on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we would then seek a way of imposing some sort of international 
sanctions" outside the U.N. structure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yongbyon facility, which houses a 25-megawatt reactor, was built in 1986, 
but Western authorities suspect that it may have been refueled clandestinely 
three years later, with the spent fuel being reprocessed into weapons-grade 
plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA has estimated that North Korea may already have manufactured one or 
two nuclear bombs and is in the early stages of developing longer-range 
missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads. The refueling planned for May is 
important to Western authorities because the Yongbyon reactor contains enough 
spent fuel to enable North Korea to expand a nuclear arsenal substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials are worried that if Pyongyang is allowed to expand a nuclear 
weapons program, it not only will threaten South Korea and Japan, but it may 
export warheads around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The IAEA demand for access to North Korea's nuclear plants actually involves 
three separate parts: The organization wants first to complete the inspections 
that it began in March, but had to break off because of restrictions that the 
North Koreas imposed; monitor the refueling at Yongbyon, and visit other 
nuclear sites.

ELECTIONS SILENCE THE KILLING FIELDS; S. AFRICA: INKATHA DECISION TO END 
BOYCOTT HAS NATAL PROVINCE BUSY WITH POLITICAL DOINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Sam Nxumalo once campaigned warily for the African National Congress here on 
the lush, green hills where the Inkatha Freedom Party is strong -- his own name 
rides a widely circulated hit list and violence has been a fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday he decided to make a weekend campaign swing into two nearby 
Inkatha-controlled townships, confident that the ANC-Inkatha bloodshed is, if 
not over, at least taking a pause before next week's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to go to the people," said Nxumalo, a 36-year-old professional 
nurse and the ANC's leader in this, one of the most turbulent sub-regions of 
Natal province. "Things have changed here in the past few days, and I want to 
test the waters. I'm not so scared anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The killing fields of Natal, scene of 14,000 political slayings since 
President Frederik W. de Klerk first began to dismantle apartheid four years 
ago, are mostly silent now, save for the sounds of politicians on the hustings 
and election officials teaching people how to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The face of Inkatha President Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi appears on campaign 
posters, often tacked to lampposts next to pictures of ANC President Nelson 
Mandela. Excitement has replaced fear across vast sections of the region. And 
the talk in both camps is of political, not military victory. 
</P>
<P>
 At Inkatha campaign headquarters in Durban, the effects of Buthelezi's 
decision to abandon his election boycott and urge his supporters to vote was 
clearly evident Friday. Thousands of newly minted posters were being dispatched 
to the far reaches of the province as staff members worked furiously at 
computers and the telephone rang constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been crazy here," said Ziba Jiyane, Inkatha's national political 
director. A few moments earlier, he had been on the telephone himself, begging 
the South African Broadcasting Co. to change its decision to stop all political 
advertising at midnight Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're begging for the whole day of Sunday," he said to an SABC official on 
the telephone. "We're desperately in need of more advertising time. Please. 
Please." 
</P>
<P>
 With Sunday designated as the last legal day for campaigning, all the parties 
are racing to get their message out. That is especially true in Natal province, 
where Inkatha's boycott had made it impossible for ANC leaders to campaign in 
dozens of communities. And many potential voters had been afraid even to 
consider voting because of possible revenge attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials, who had been prevented from creating polling stations in 
Natal areas controlled by chiefs loyal to Inkatha, now plan 1,500 sites, up 
from 1,000. About 200 of them will be mobile units. And virtually every one of 
the province's 6.5 million residents will be able to walk to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the ANC and Inkatha are hoping that the elections, by secret ballot, will 
now reflect their true support in areas controlled by the other side. 
Independent opinion polls in Natal suggest that the ANC will win 50% of the 
vote, compared to Inkatha's 19%. (Most polls give the ANC a 50% or better 
nationwide vote, compared to 5% or less for Inkatha, whose support lies 
primarily in Natal.) 
</P>
<P>
 But polls are not very reliable in Natal, where thousands do not have 
telephones and many more are afraid to reveal how they will vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi, on the campaign trail Friday, predicted that his party will "win 
enough votes to take its place in a government of national unity," but he added 
that he will refuse to become part of any such government. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Eshowe area, about 120 miles northwest of Durban, the race is likely to 
be close between Inkatha, the ANC and the liberal Democratic Party, which is 
supported by white farmers here. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials only planned to open 11 polls in the area, which has about 
100,000 potential voters. But chiefs supporting Inkatha now have welcomed 
polling stations in their communities, and 67 polling sites are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a chance of winning here," the ANC's Nxumalo said. "All this 
time, people have been suppressed by Inkatha. They could not express their 
views. And we believe many of them support us. They are fed up with Inkatha, 
and especially the chiefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Nxumalo hopes to increase ANC support when he takes his party's promises of 
electricity, running water and paved roads into the Inkatha-held areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just go and start speaking," he said. 'I don't think there is anyone 
from Inkatha who would attack me." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the ANC and Inkatha blame each other for the violence. And Jiyane, 
the Inkatha political leader, said tensions have diminished because "our 
enemies believe they can defeat us at the polls." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the moment, the Inkatha political campaign is in disarray. It will be 
able to rely on its large network of chiefs and other party workers to help get 
people to the polls. But party leaders, working around the clock, are plagued 
by disagreements over how to use the few days remaining before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have time for a learning curve," Jiyane said. "There's disagreement 
about where to focus our energies." 
</P>
<P>
 Will the peace hold? No one knows for sure. The violence in Natal was common 
long before any elections were planned, fed by political disagreement but also 
by the apartheid system, clan feuds and unknown forces trying to destabilize 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But the elections, if they are judged free and fair, will mark the first time 
in the region's history that the mostly Zulu province has been able to choose 
sides democratically. And if the loser abides by the results, ANC and Inkatha 
leaders here believe that the peace may hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jiyane: "There are no losers if lives are saved."

SERBS DEFY NATO, CONTINUE SIEGE; BALKANS: AS AIR STRIKES LOOM, GORAZDE'S MAYOR 
DESCRIBES SCENES OF CARNAGE IN EMBATTLED ENCLAVE. U.N. TROOPS CAUGHT IN MIDDLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Serbian gunmen willing to take on the world, and U.N. officers loath to 
confront them, maneuvered ominously Friday in anticipation of NATO air strikes 
that threaten a colossal escalation of the Balkan war. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a warning by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization of massive air 
attacks unless the Bosnian Serb assault on the city of Gorazde ceases 
immediately, nationalist rebels continued to pound artillery shells into the 
crowded U.N. safe area, the mayor of Gorazde reported via ham radio. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Protection Force commanders recalled a blocked convoy of 141 peacekeepers 
headed for besieged Gorazde, only to have their return to Sarajevo halted by 
rebels intent on keeping them as a potential human shield against Western 
bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO officials meeting in Brussels gave the Serbs until just after midnight 
tonight local time to pull back all gunmen and artillery 1.9 miles from Gorazde 
and to let U.N. troops and humanitarian aid through to its 65,000 desperate 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorazde suffered another day of fierce bombardment as Bosnian Serb leaders 
engaged in fruitless peace talks in Belgrade with the top U.N. civilian in the 
war-torn Balkans, Yasushi Akashi of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelling and sniper fire killed 99 people and wounded nearly 300 in a second 
day of carnage among the Muslims herded into the city center and exposed to the 
wrath of the militant nationalist rebels. The death toll Thursday was 97. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's mayor, Ismet Briga, described a scene of horror, with human corpses 
and animal carcasses littering streets so racked by artillery fire and gunfire 
that harried medics could not retrieve the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Four aid workers with the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees 
trapped in Gorazde reported intense bombardment of vital facilities filled with 
desperate civilians displaced earlier in the 3-week-old siege. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hospital has been hit several times again," said the Sarajevo spokesman 
for the refugee agency, Kris Janowski. "The area is shrouded in smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. airlift of food and vital supplies to Sarajevo resumed Friday after a 
12-day suspension after token air strikes April 10-11. Some relief officials 
speculated, however, that the move was more an effort to stock up supplies for 
an expected escalation of the conflict than an indication that the security 
concerns have abated. 
</P>
<P>
 Janowski said he hoped that the Serbs comply with the NATO ultimatum, warning: 
"Otherwise, we're facing a humanitarian disaster which we will be talking about 
for a long time. What has happened is bad enough, but it could get worse if the 
indiscriminate shelling continues." 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian rebels see Gorazde as a vital part of the rogue republic they have 
carved out of Bosnia because it is at the junction of two important roadways 
and the Drina River. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also one of only three surviving Muslim pockets in eastern Bosnia, which 
has otherwise been conquered and subjected to the Serbs' brutal policy of 
"ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 In Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, Akashi met with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic, his Bosnian proxy, Radovan Karadzic, and the Bosnian Serb military 
chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic. No progress toward restarting peace talks was 
reported from the session conducted while the Bosnian Serb rebels carried out 
their bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 House-to-house fighting was reported in Gorazde as Serbian infantry moved to 
within a few blocks of the city's main square, the mayor reported in an 
emotional exchange with Sarajevo officials via ham radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have only two choices: We can be slaughtered, or we can fight and die with 
dignity," Briga said. "The town will not fall as long as there is anybody alive 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The courage to hold out against the storm of Serbian artillery and tank fire 
appeared inspired by the expectation that NATO warplanes may soon come to their 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 While the prospect of Western intervention kindled hope among the anguished 
people of Gorazde, U.N. officials at mission headquarters feared that the 
peacekeeping force is about to be sucked into full-scale war without the 
necessary troops, equipment or mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we haven't got an army that works," said one U.N. officer concerned 
that the 15,000-strong contingent deployed to assist humanitarian aid 
operations is unsuitable for conducting the ground activities needed in 
conjunction with air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite apart from the (differing) regiments and the nationalities, we don't 
have the equipment. The heaviest kit we've got are 11 Leopard tanks up in 
Tuzla," the European officer said of the peacekeeping force made up of troops 
from dozens of countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not here for war. This is the problem," the exasperated officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an immense feeling of frustration, because we felt so close a few 
weeks ago to getting somewhere," he said, referring to a NATO ultimatum that 
stopped the shelling of Sarajevo and to the reunion of Bosnian Croats and 
Muslims. "Suddenly we're in a situation where it's all blown up in our faces. 
It's like being a beaten semifinalist. It's awful." 
</P>
<P>
 Another officer at the U.N. command post here warned that stepping up air 
strikes would effectively put the impartial peacekeeping force on the side of 
the outgunned Bosnian government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 If new air raids fail to force the Serbs to desist and return to negotiations, 
the U.N. mission would be unable to continue its operations in support of 
delivering humanitarian aid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If things went badly wrong, we would all scuttle back to the federation and 
put together a new force and a new mandate," the officer said, speaking of a 
possible retreat by the U.N. mission to territory held by the reunited Bosnian 
Croat and government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo, the current headquarters, is surrounded by Serbian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign diplomats and relief workers, however, seem united in the view that 
peaceful options for resolving the Bosnian crisis have been exhausted, 
especially in the Gorazde enclave, where at least 535 civilians have been 
killed and 1,740 wounded in the latest offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government praised the NATO decision to halt the killing in 
Gorazde. Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic expressed gratitude to President 
Clinton, whom he credited with pushing the NATO alliance to finally confront 
the rebels who have conquered at least 72% of this country since taking up arms 
against its proclaimed independence in March, 1992.

NEWS ANALYSIS; PRESIDENT SENDS MIXED SIGNALS TO U.S., SERBS; CONFLICT: CLINTON 
TALKS TOUGH TO REBELS EVEN AS HE REASSURES AMERICANS ON LIMITED INVOLVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing on the verge of wider military involvement in the Bosnian war, 
President Clinton broadcast two deeply conflicting messages Friday: to the 
Serbs -- NATO means business; to the American people -- no ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's statements, repeated several times in a news conference, underscore 
the conflict at the center of U.S. policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Clinton is 
willing to use force to try to bring the Serbs back to the negotiating table, 
but only to a point. The Administration's policy is defined not so much by its 
objectives as by its limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and his aides were cheered by reports that Bosnian Serb forces 
had agreed to a cease-fire around the Muslim enclave of Gorazde in response to 
NATO's demand for a demilitarized zone there. But U.S. officials have made this 
much clear: If the Serbs defy the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, as they have frequently in recent weeks, and if the cost of 
punishing them becomes too high, Clinton would be willing to halt the operation 
and accept a failure rather than be drawn more deeply into the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 While the President has refused to say so explicitly, he telegraphed his 
position by repeatedly ruling out the introduction of U.S. troops into the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "If what we are doing doesn't work, then I will consider other options," 
Clinton said. And he repeated that "the Bosnian Serbs should not doubt NATO's 
willingness to act." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton reiterated this week that those options include the possibility of 
lifting the international arms embargo that has blocked weapons shipments to 
the Bosnian government. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Clinton added, "there has categorically been no discussion in which I 
have been involved, or which I have encouraged or approved, involving the 
introduction of American ground forces into Bosnia" except as peacekeepers 
after a peace treaty has been signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials concede the consequence of such a policy: Clinton 
cannot reassure Americans without comforting the Serbs as well. It is possible, 
they admit, that the limits of the U.S. position could encourage the Serbs to 
defy NATO's newly stated resolve, hoping simply to outlast U.S. patience. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the risk of the U.S. strategy. The hope, by contrast, is that the 
Serbian leadership will decide, as U.S. experts have long predicted, that their 
forces already have all the territory they want and will not be willing to 
endure much more pain for only marginal gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking after a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, whose 
country has relatively close relations with Serb-led Yugoslavia, Clinton 
appealed to Serbian leaders to make exactly that decision, saying they "need to 
assert themselves at this moment" to control more aggressive military leaders 
and "avoid further wreckage." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials say that so far, they have been unable to say for 
sure precisely who is in control of the Bosnian Serb forces -- whether the 
civilian leadership can really negotiate an agreement that the military will 
abide by. In addition, they are uncertain about how much control can be exerted 
by the leadership of the neighboring Yugoslavia, which has armed and supplied 
the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also sought, once again, to reassure the Serbs that NATO's actions are 
not designed to "win a military victory on the ground" for the Bosnian 
government or to make "a measurable and dramatic change of the situation on the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the strictly limited U.S. mission is clear. U.S. officials 
worry about the consequences of failure in Bosnia, both for the Bosnians and 
for broader U.S. credibility around the world. They admit that a U.S. failure 
in Bosnia could embolden other U.S. adversaries, most notably in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 But against that potential, Clinton and his aides balance a stronger fear -- a 
repeat of Vietnam. Several Administration officials, most notably National 
Security Adviser Anthony Lake, were involved in various stages of the Vietnam 
debacle. With that experience in their minds, Clinton and his advisers have 
been determined not to allow themselves to be drawn further into Bosnia's 
warfare by the seductive logic of escalating intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the U.S. "exit strategy" in the current conflict, Clinton made a 
clear, although unstated, reference to the ghost of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult to analogize this conflict from the point of view of the 
United States and the United Nations to others which occurred during the Cold 
War and which had some sort of Cold War rationale, some of which sometimes 
broke down," he said. "It's important not to be too arrogant about our ability 
to totally dictate events so far from our shores." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's advocacy of limited force in Bosnia received a boost from his 
visitor. The war in Bosnia is "a fire that can spread very fast," Papandreou 
said in a statement opening the news conference. It is "a tragedy indeed, a 
great tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he warned, the danger of NATO's policy is that "step by step we may be 
dragged into a land war which would be really, by modern standards, a tragedy 
much greater than we have seen in Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 Papandreou's presence on the podium was something of a personal triumph for 
the Greek leader, who was effectively barred from the country during his 
previous eight-year stint as prime minister by the refusal of former Presidents 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush to meet with him in Washington. The previous 
Administrations believed that his policies were anti-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials argue that Papandreou has mellowed this time 
around and, in any case, find his former positions less troubling than the 
Republican Administrations did.

CLINTON PRAISES PREDECESSOR'S 'WISE COUNSEL, INTELLIGENCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following is the text of President Clinton's remarks on the death of former 
President Richard Nixon: 
</P>
<P>
 It is my sad duty to report to the people of the United States that Richard M. 
Nixon, who served as our 37th President, died this evening in New York City at 
9:08 p.m. with his family at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary and I send our deepest condolences to the entire Nixon family. We hope 
that Tricia and Edward Cox, and their son, Christopher; Julie and David 
Eisenhower and their children, Jenny, Alex and Melanie, know that the best 
wishes of all their fellow Americans are with them during their moment of 
sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible to be in this job without feeling a special bond with the 
people who have gone before. And I was deeply grateful to President Nixon for 
his wise counsel on so many occasions on many issues over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 His service to me and to our country during this period was like the rest of 
his service to the nation for nearly a half-century: He gave of himself with 
intelligence and devotion to duty and his country owes him a debt of gratitude 
for that service. 
</P>
<P>
 We face today a world of increasingly uncertain and difficult challenges. But 
it is a world of great opportunity in no small part because of the vision of 
Richard Nixon during a particularly difficult period of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 He understood the threat of communism, but he also had the wisdom to know when 
it was time to reach out to the Soviet Union and to China. All Americans, 
indeed all people throughout the world, owe him what he regarded as the 
ultimate compliment: He was a statesman who sought to build a lasting structure 
of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, he experienced his fair share of adversity and controversy, but 
his resilience and his diligent desire to give something back to this country 
and to the world provide a lesson for all of us about maintaining our faith in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of everything, that faith led President Nixon to leave his mark on 
his times as few national figures have done in our history, and led him to 
continue to serve right up to the end of his life. Indeed, no less than a month 
before his passing he was still in touch with me about the great issues of this 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Again I say, the sorrow and the best wishes of the American people are with 
President Nixon's family. We thank them and our prayers are with them.

MEMORIES OF NIXON ARE BITTERSWEET FOR VALLEY POLITICIANS, ACADEMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER and JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For San Fernando Valley-area politicians and academics who knew and studied 
him, the memories of Richard Nixon are indeed bittersweet -- that of a shrewd, 
complicated man, a slick and media-savvy former President always ready to deal 
the quick political pay-back while forgiving himself for any mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, they agree that Nixon was indeed a chameleon, a political 
animal of more than nine lives, able to rise from the ashes of Watergate to 
become a respected political statesman who changed the face of American foreign 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the debate will rage for years: How will history treat the 37th President? 
</P>
<P>
 "From the very early days the man entered politics, it was quite clear that 
was going to be his career. And from the very early days, he was a scoundrel," 
said Eugene Price, chairman of the political science department at Cal State 
Northridge, who once spent a day interviewing the former President at his home 
in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was either a politically amoral or immoral person," he said. "Politically, 
his attitude was anything goes as long as you don't get caught. To his dying 
day, he could never understand why an observing public could not condone his 
activity in Watergate," Price added, saying Nixon simply considered the debacle 
a matter of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described "middle-of-the-road liberal," Price said he doubted that 
Nixon's reputation will be much redeemed over the years and that history will 
rank him as a "mediocre" President along with the likes of Herbert Hoover and 
Calvin Coolidge. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just a tacky politician. He had no real class. Who in America can 
point to Richard Nixon and say, 'There's the man I would like my daughter to 
marry,' " Price said. "The President is our great national image, but in his 
hands, that became squandered." 
</P>
<P>
 For John Broesamle, a CSUN history professor who's written about Nixon in a 
book on modern politics, Nixon will be among the most difficult Presidents of 
this century to evaluate because his great achievements, such as reaching 
detente with the Soviet Union, were counterbalanced by even greater failures, 
such as Watergate and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a personal level, "Nixon's a man who spent much of his career over a 
span of more than 40 years involved in an exercise of explaining his past 
behavior and rehabilitating his image," Broesamle said. And partly because of 
Nixon's successful efforts to recast his career, time will mellow history's 
reading of it, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said that will probably only boost Nixon's presidency from 
"failure to marginal failure, from the lower class to the lower middle class." 
He said history will record the man as "crude beyond any external expectation," 
"petty, mean and vindictive," and "an opportunist whose chief character flaw 
was a lack of principle." 
</P>
<P>
 "Historians shouldn't mellow too much toward Richard Nixon because he doesn't 
deserve it," Broesamle concluded, saying the tarnish of Watergate will never be 
wiped away. "His most memorable phrase was 'I'm not a crook' -- and he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite calling him "a control freak" and a man with "an awful lot of 
psychological hang-ups," Rodolfo Acuna, CSUN professor of Chicano studies, said 
history will record Nixon as a much better President than he was popularly 
perceived during the Watergate era, particularly in terms of his foreign policy 
successes. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna said Nixon "had much more vision in foreign policy" than Ronald Reagan 
and called Nixon "much brighter" than either Reagan or John F. Kennedy. "If 
Reagan would have been in during Vietnam, he would have nuked them. (Nixon) 
probably will go down in history as an above-average President when it comes to 
foreign policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at the domestic level, Acuna blamed Nixon for reductions in job training 
programs, being weak on civil rights and beginning to undermine Lyndon B. 
Johnson's anti-poverty programs. "He set the groundwork for Reagan. Reagan was 
a President who screwed the middle class, where Nixon with his policies turned 
the middle class against the poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Davis, a former GOP state senator and Los Angeles police chief, now 77, 
recalls the former President as a complicated man always ready to forgive his 
own mistakes, one with an elephant's memory. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's glad that he's not the historian who has to decide if Nixon, in the 
end, was America's friend or bad-boy foe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a real test for historians because of Watergate," he said. 
"He obviously made some terrible mistakes there on leveling with the American 
people. But his recovery from that and his re-emergence as a statesman 
shouldn't be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, he proved that, between Watergate and his life as a political 
statesman, he was very human and that there's hope for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a man of very strong convictions who was really brilliant. I would 
always be amazed when I sat down with him when he could recount the football or 
baseball scores from years ago and political elections as well. He never seemed 
to forget anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis recalls at times having a rocky road with Nixon, after once having 
called former Atty. Gen. John Mitchell "a bald-faced liar." 
</P>
<P>
 In his own way, Nixon wreaked his revenge. A picture taken with the President 
-- a would-be keepsake for most people -- showed only Davis' left ear. And 
once, among a group of other police chiefs visiting the Oval Office, Nixon 
looked at Davis and handed him a pair of cuff-links, saying he wanted to be 
sure that Davis knew that the items did not come at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to embarrass me," Davis recalled. "I merely responded that, 
'Mr. President, I didn't think you stole them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, though, Davis said, Nixon showed his true political colors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, a local Republican group asked to use Nixon's Western 
White House, Casa Pacifica in San Clemente, for a fund-raiser. At first, the 
ex-President was all business, saying over the telephone that the house could 
be used only if all profits went to the Nixon Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he called me back on the phone and said that he and Pat had talked the 
matter over and that not only would our group get to keep the profits, but that 
they insisted on catering the whole affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a nice human side. Too bad his brilliance was wasted." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Rep. Bobbi Fiedler recalls meeting Nixon in 1984 with other politicians 
for a strategy session prior to Reagan's reelection -- and walking away 
impressed with his political acumen, even a decade after he had left political 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the personal characteristic that stands out is the high-level skill 
in terms of strategy," she said. "Many Presidents relied on pollsters and 
political consultants. But Nixon was very hands-on in that regard. He had 
strong opinions and many, if not all, of them were well-founded. They turned 
out to be true." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Nixon's legacy, Fiedler believes that he will be able to outdistance 
Watergate as a career milestone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, this is a generational matter," she said. "The younger generation 
won't be as tuned in to Watergate as the older ones. They didn't see him in 
that context. The fact that he stayed in the political arena and continued to 
have a role in foreign policy will more be remembered, I think. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, Watergate is hard to forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate political consultant Paul Clarke, as a reporter for ABC News, 
covered Nixon as President during his glory years: 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, Watergate will be the stone around Richard Nixon's historical 
neck," he said. "But there is so much to consider about the man. In the area of 
foreign policy, he was the person who started the major changes in the Cold War 
relationships. There was his relationship with (Soviet leader Leonid) Breshnev, 
his stature around the world that helped move the nation from a real Cold War 
posture." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were his bold moves in international finance, removing the United 
States from the gold standard, allowing the dollar to compete in foreign 
markets. "It had a long-lasting effect on economy," Clarke said. "He realized 
back then when nobody else did that international trade would be the thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke said that from his viewpoint as a journalist, Nixon will find a place 
in the midlands of American Presidents in terms of greatness and fiasco, "not 
in the morass of Coolidge, Grant and Fillmore, but not with Lincoln and 
Jefferson."

HAITIANS BROUGHT ASHORE IN U.S. POLICY EXCEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Haitian refugees, some barefoot and others in their Sunday best, landed Friday 
with all their worldly belongings stuffed into overnight travel bags, purses 
and gym bags. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an exception to the Clinton Administration's policy of routinely 
stopping Haitians at sea, the 414 refugees were brought ashore by members of 
the Coast Guard, who donned rubber gloves to unload the luggage as a protection 
against any possible diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Intercepted at sea Thursday aboard an overloaded 65-foot wooden freighter, the 
Haitians were transferred to a Coast Guard cutter Friday and brought ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 Women holding children were among the first passengers turned over to 
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials.  
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton reiterated his commitment to a policy to send 
Haitians stopped at sea back home, but he said an exception was made because of 
"extraordinary circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 To support the order allowing the Haitians to enter the country Friday, 
officials cited crowding on the freighter, its nearness to the Florida coast, 
reports of abuse on board, a need for medical treatment and suspicions of 
smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, refugees from that island are allowed 
to enter the United States by sea because of Fidel Castro's communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians caught at sea, however, face forcible return to their homeland under 
a 1992 George Bush Administration policy. As a candidate, Clinton denounced the 
policy; he embraced it once in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern cited a second incident Thursday night 
as evidence the repatriation policy remains in effect. A Coast Guard cutter 
intercepted a small boat between Haiti and Cuba and returned the 15 aboard to 
Haiti, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the packed conditions on the freighter, the new arrivals trudged ashore 
Friday to stand packed under the tents during a thundershower while awaiting 
processing. 
</P>
<P>
 The group included 271 men, 112 women and 17 children, the Justice Department 
said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; FIRST LADY ADDS FRESH DETAILS, CONFLICTS TO WHITEWATER STORY; 
MEDIA: MRS. CLINTON DESCRIBES A TANGENTIAL LEGAL ROLE WITH MADISON S&L. BUT HER 
ACCOUNT OF HER INVOLVEMENT DIFFERS SHARPLY WITH MCDOUGAL'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unprecedented performance for a First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton spent 
more than an hour Friday offering her most detailed -- and in some cases her 
first -- answers to troubling questions that have arisen from her involvement 
in the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, her answers shed fresh light on the issues involved; in others, 
her responses conflicted sharply with the versions of events offered by other 
participants or previously reported in the media.  
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the key issues she addressed, her answers, and how those 
answers correspond to what was previously known: 
</P>
<P>
 Was Hillary Clinton involved in a conflict of interest when she represented 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan before state regulators at a time when her 
husband was governor of Arkansas? 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: Among the most important questions about her personal involvement 
in Whitewater is the issue of how and why Hillary Clinton, then an attorney at 
the prestigious Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, represented Madison before a 
state regulator appointed by her husband. Madison was owned by James B. 
McDougal, the Clintons' partner in Whitewater, a real estate venture in the 
Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas. The relationship between Madison and 
Whitewater is a key issue in the affair; special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. is 
probing whether funds from Madison were illegally siphoned off to Whitewater or 
to pay off the debts from Bill Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1985, Mrs. Clinton and the Rose firm represented Madison before 
the Arkansas Securities Commission, then chaired by Clinton-appointee Beverly 
Bassett. Madison, already in deep financial trouble, sought approval to issue 
preferred stock in order to bolster its balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 MRS. CLINTON: On Friday, Mrs. Clinton said that she was only brought into the 
matter tangentially by another, much younger attorney at the Rose firm. 
Although she did not identify him, the attorney involved was Richard N. Massey, 
now a Rose partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a very bright young associate in our law firm who had a 
relationship with one of the officers at Madison, a young man who he had known. 
They began talking. Those two young men thought that it would be legal under 
Arkansas law for a savings and loan to issue preferred stock, but there was 
absolutely no law on that, and so they couldn't be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they decided that what they wanted to do was to ask the person who 
regulated savings and loans whether it was legal . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton said that, under the firm's rules, the young attorney needed a 
partner to "backstop" his work, and "knew that I knew Jim McDougal and also 
knew that Jim had been a client of our firm in the past. So he came to me and 
asked me if I would talk with Jim to see whether or not Jim would let the 
lawyer and the bank officer go forward on this project." 
</P>
<P>
 She did so, Mrs. Clinton said, arranging for the firm to be paid a $2,000 per 
month retainer. "That was arranged, and the young attorney, the young bank 
officer did all the work." She added that her name was put on documents related 
to the case only because "I was what you call the billing attorney -- I had to 
send the bill to get the payment made." 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER VERSIONS: Mrs. Clinton's account differs sharply from the version 
provided by McDougal. He says that Bill Clinton came to him and asked him to 
find some legal work for Hillary Clinton because the family needed money. 
McDougal says he then agreed to put Hillary on a $2,000 a month retainer, and 
told Madison officials to find legal work for her to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, McDougal says he does not believe Mrs. Clinton ever handled any 
other legal work for Madison besides the one instance of representing the 
thrift before state regulators, raising the question of whether Madison hired 
her for the specific purpose of going before a regulator appointed by her 
husband. Internal Madison documents released by the Resolution Trust Corp., the 
S&L cleanup agency, show that virtually all of the thrift's other legal work 
was handled by Madison general counsel John Selig, a partner in another Little 
Rock law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Hillary Clinton receive undue favorable treatment in her highly profitable 
commodities trading in the late 1970s? 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: Mrs. Clinton netted almost $100,000 in a two-year period of 
trading in highly volatile commodities markets after being urged to get into 
such investments by a close friend and prominent Arkansas lawyer, James B. 
Blair, who represented the politically important Tyson's Food Inc., a major 
Arkansas employer. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has repeatedly portrayed her trading activity as a case of an 
ordinary small investor who took her chances and came up a winner; but experts 
and officials in the futures trading industry have said that it would have been 
highly unusual for an amateur to pull that off successfully; indeed, many 
brokerage firms would never have allowed a novice investor to try it. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerage firm she worked through was later beset by lawsuits from angry 
investors who charged that the firm allocated winning trades to favored clients 
and losing trades to less fortunate investors. Mrs. Clinton's trading activity 
has raised questions especially since she made a $5,300 profit on her initial 
$1,000 on her very first trade in October, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 MRS. CLINTON: On Friday, Mrs. Clinton said she opened her first commodities 
account on Blair's "very strong recommendation," and acknowledged that she 
relied heavily on Blair's advice for her trading activity. But she said she 
doesn't believe that she was given favorable treatment by her broker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really no evidence of that," Mrs. Clinton said. "You know, not all my 
trades made money, some of them lost money." 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that Leo Melamed, the former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange, has been asked to review her trading records by the White House and 
has found no evidence of favorable treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER COMMENT: Some market experts who have studied her trading activity find 
it hard to believe that she was able to turn in such a remarkably successful 
track record -- with her winning trades far outnumbering her losing ones -- 
without some preferential treatment by her broker. 
</P>
<P>
 One commodity trader with 30 years' experience in the business who reviewed 
her records told The Times that her activity was highly unusual, both in the 
frequency and size of trades and in the small amount of capital behind them. 
Another trader described her trading as "unusual and fortuitous, and her timing 
was perfect." Mrs. Clinton got out just before the market plunged. 
</P>
<P>
 Have Bill and Hillary Clinton fully revealed the extent of their profits or 
losses from Whitewater? 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: Both the President and Mrs. Clinton have argued from the beginning 
of the Whitewater controversy that they lost money on the real estate venture. 
Whitewater was a 50-50 joint venture between the Clintons and McDougal and his 
then-wife Susan -- yet the Clintons apparently walked away from Whitewater 
while suffering only half to one-third the losses of those taken by the 
McDougals. 
</P>
<P>
 MRS. CLINTON: She declined to provide detailed answers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't answer that," she said. "I mean, we gave whatever money we were 
requested to give by Jim McDougal. We did whatever he asked us. We saw no 
records. We saw no documents. He was someone who had been in real estate 
business with many people we knew, including Sen. (J. William) Fulbright, and 
we just assumed that whatever he needed he would ask for, and we didn't have 
any information to the contrary." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton denied that she tried to use losses from Whitewater to offset her 
tax liability from her large profits in commodities trading -- contradicting 
earlier statements by McDougal. And she said she had "no memory" of making 
interest payments on Whitewater loans on the same day that she withdrew funds 
from her commodities brokerage account.  
</P>
<P>
 "In 78, 79, and 80 we were still hopeful that we were going to make money on 
our investment in north Arkansas," she noted.

EXCERPTS: MRS. CLINTON LINKS PROBLEMS TO 'OUR INEXPERIENCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are excerpts of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's news conference 
Friday:  
</P>
<P>
 Question: Do you know of any money that could have gone from Madison to the 
Whitewater project or any of your husband's political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Absolutely not. I do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Actually on the same theme, with your commodities profits, it is difficult 
. . . to look at the amount of the investment and the size of the profit. I 
mean, is there any way you can explain how you --  
</P>
<P>
 A: . . . Back in 1978 in October, one of our best friends, Jim Blair . . . 
talked to me about what he thought was a great investment opportunity. He is 
someone who has been an investor ever since he was a teen-ager, with usually 
very good results. . . . And when Jim said, "I think there's going to be a 
great opportunity to make money," and explained why and asked me what I thought 
we could afford to invest, I told him $1,000. So I opened an account at his 
very strong recommendation and proceeded to trade over the next months until 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, not all my trades made money. Some of them lost money. I talked to 
Mr. Blair very frequently. In fact, Jim would call me on a regular basis and I 
would make a decision whether I would or would not trade, and then the trade 
would be placed. Often he placed it for me. And there was nothing wrong with 
that. He was on the spot. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I stopped trading in July of 1979, and I did stop trading in large measure 
because I could not keep up with it. It takes a lot of nerve to be in the 
commodities trading, and I had just found out I was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 And so when he called again I said, you know, I just don't want to do this 
anymore. . . . And I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't because he and other friends 
of mine who were trading ended up losing money. So it was a good investment 
offered by somebody who knew a lot, who could provide a lot of good advice, and 
I was lucky and made the decision to stop when I did. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you wonder since then if maybe your broker might have, because of your 
position or your husband's, might have given you some kind of unfavorable -- 
or, you know, a favored advantage? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's really no evidence of that. I didn't believe it at the time. As I 
said, I made and lost money in that commodities account. . . . And even Mr. 
Blair, who ended up losing money, I think would find it very hard to argue that 
he got any favorable treatment. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: There was a second account with the Stephens Co. in which I think you 
invested $5,000. And at first the White House claimed you lost money on it, but 
later you put out documents showing you actually made $6,000 on it and didn't 
close it until a few months after Chelsea was born. 
</P>
<P>
 A: . . . There were two accounts. The first account, the one that I was just 
talking about, was the Refco account. . . . Now, I closed that account for good 
in October of '79 and I took some of the money that I had made and put it into 
an account at Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 And at that point, I made that a discretionary account. My Refco account was a 
non-discretionary account, which meant that I had to approve and give the 
go-ahead for every trade. In the discretionary account at Stephens, my broker 
made most of the decisions, and I think did a good job for me. He diversified 
the money that I gave him and put it into money market and stocks and bonds, 
and $5,000 into some commodities. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In February of 1980, my daughter was born. . . . And I remember talking to my 
broker some time after that, and I said, "You know, I just want to get out of 
commodities altogether. I don't ever want to have to worry about it." So he got 
me out of the positions that I had been in so that by May I was no longer doing 
any kind of commodity trading in the Stephens account. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, what happened, though, is that he took the money that I now know I made 
-- I really didn't think I'd made any money in commodities -- and he bought 
some stock and he did some other things for me. Now in the fall of 1980, my 
husband lost his election, we moved, so by 1981, when I gathered all my 
documents together to give to my accountant, I had a year-end statement from 
Stephens which did not report anything about commodities, I had a year-end 
statement from the Peavey Brokerage Co., which reported a loss, and I had no 
year-end statement from either Clayton or the company called ACLI. 
</P>
<P>
 So I think what happened is we bundled all of the documents we had because I 
took all of the reports that I had, gave them to the accountant, and I believed 
that in the absence of a year-end statement, the accountant and my husband and 
I missed the fact that we had actually made some money in the Aklee account. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you know anything about Mr. Foster's death? Do you know what he wanted 
to tell the President that he didn't get to tell him? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You know, I don't know that he wanted to tell the President anything. 
That's the first I've heard of that. My memory is that the President actually 
talked to Vince Monday night before he died . . . and when I talked with the 
President afterward, he was stunned because the conversation was a very normal 
kind of a conversation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: . . . There's been a lot criticism of the papers in Mr. Foster's office, 
that some may have been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I know there's been a lot of concern and criticism about that. I cannot 
speak to that in any detail, but I know the special counsel is looking into the 
circumstances surrounding Mr. Foster's death and I assume he will issue a 
report about that which I hope will put all these matters to rest once and for 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The Whitewater development was set up, as you say, as a 50-50 partnership 
between the Clintons and the McDougals, meaning that you were liable for 50% of 
the losses or 50% of the gains; and yet, by your own accounting, you lost half 
or even maybe a third of what the McDougals lost. . . . Doesn't that 
discrepancy represent some sort of a gift or gratuity? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. And let me say that, yes, the ownership of the corporation was 50-50. 
The liability on the underlying debt was 100% for each one of us. I mean, there 
was no gift in that. When my husband and I signed that mortgage and when we 
re-signed guarantees, we assumed the whole responsibility. I mean, if Jim had 
gone into bankruptcy early on, if Susan had left, we would not have only 50% of 
the obligation, we would have 100% of the obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But why was it that the McDougals lost so much more money than you did? I 
don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I can't answer that. I mean, we gave whatever money we were requested to 
give by Jim McDougal. I mean, he was the one who would say, "Here's what you 
owe on interest, here's what your contribution should be." We did whatever he 
asked us. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: . . . surprising that, given that you were jointly and severally liable for 
all the debt and that you and your husband are both lawyers, that you would be 
so passive about a substantial investment. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, but we were not real estate developers, and Jim had a track record. 
And I wasn't a cattle expert; I trusted Jim Blair and it worked out for me. And 
I wasn't a real estate expert and we lost money. Those things happen. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: . . . I'm wondering what kind of a toll, if any, this has taken on you and 
the President's personal and political lives, and do you ever look in the 
mirror and wish that you just never got into this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. Never, never. I mean, some days are better than other days, but you 
know, I think what has helped me in the last couple of weeks, aside from some 
good friends who have talked with me and helped me get rezoned, if you will, is 
my belief that this is really a result of our inexperience in Washington. . . .

WILSON NARROWS SUPREME COURT LIST TO 6; LEGAL SYSTEM: ALL OF HIS POSSIBLE 
CHOICES TO REPLACE JUSTICE PANELLI ARE CONSERVATIVES. ONLY ONE IS A WHITE MALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than seven months of consideration, Gov. Pete Wilson has narrowed 
his election-year search for the California Supreme Court to six conservatives, 
most of them women or minorities and former prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisers say Wilson is looking for a collegial, conservative 
consensus-builder, preferably from Northern California, to fill the vacancy 
left by the Jan. 31 retirement of Justice Edward Panelli, who told the governor 
of his decision to step down in early September. Five of the six finalists 
serve on the state Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Under political pressure to appoint a woman or a minority, Wilson has selected 
three women as finalists and only one white man. Wilson rankled some critics in 
1991 when he named Justice Ronald George, who is white, to fill a vacancy left 
by Justice Allen Broussard, who was the court's only African American. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's delay in filling the vacancy has prompted speculation that his 
first choice for the job may not have fared well in the California State Bar 
commission's confidential ratings, which were completed weeks ago, or that he 
is waiting for a politically opportune moment to announce his nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Panelli's retirement, the court has been forced to borrow judges from 
the Court of Appeal to hear cases and break ties, creating delays and prompting 
concerns about potential inconsistencies in court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, (the vacancy) slows everything down," said University of Santa 
Clara Law School Dean Gerald Uelmen, citing an extremely light schedule for 
oral arguments since Panelli retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Court of Appeal justices from around the state are being asked to cast 
instrumental votes when the court is tied 3 to 3 over which cases to accept for 
review -- even though the judges were not present during the court's private 
deliberations over the cases. Four votes are needed to grant review. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisers to Wilson noted that the court has operated before with even longer 
vacancies, which have resulted in sharp drops in the number of cases decided.  
</P>
<P>
 Often slow to fill government vacancies, Wilson has been especially distracted 
in recent months by the Southern California earthquake, fund raising for his 
campaign and an announcement that the headquarters for Taco Bell was 
considering relocating to Texas, his advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has yet to interview any of the court finalists, although he is close to 
narrowing the field, his staff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is his appointments office wants to move forward, and he has not 
been able to find sufficient time for something that is this important to him," 
said Vigo (Chip) Nielsen, Wilson's campaign lawyer. "It has nothing to do with 
politics at all. It has to do with an exceptionally heavy workload." 
</P>
<P>
 The six finalists are Patricia Bamattre-Manoukian, an associate justice from 
the Court of Appeal in San Jose; Janice Brown, Wilson's legal affairs 
secretary; Ming W. Chin, an associate Court of Appeal justice here; Reuben 
Ortega, an associate Court of Appeal justice in Los Angeles; Arthur Scotland, 
an associate Court of Appeal justice in Sacramento; and Kathryn Mickle 
Werdegar, also an associate Court of Appeal justice here. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, his advisers said, wants a justice with Panelli's personal skills and 
temperament. The retired justice was well-liked, easily approachable and 
generally accessible to the public and the news media. Court analysts credited 
him for his collegial style and ability to bring together divergent views on 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Geographical balance also is a consideration, the advisers said, but not an 
overriding one. Five of the court's six justices are from Southern California 
and one is from Fresno. Panelli was from the Bay Area. Among the finalists, 
only Ortega lives in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The court is headquartered in San Francisco, and all the justices maintain Bay 
Area residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the conservative credentials of the finalists, Wilson's second appointee 
to the court is not likely to change its philosophical leanings, which tend to 
be pro-prosecution and pro-business. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have speculated that Wilson has moved slowly in filling the spot because 
he initially wanted to name Brown, his legal affairs secretary, but later 
changed his mind because of her lack of judicial experience, a factor that the 
California State Bar probably considered in its rating. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Bar committee that evaluated the six refused to disclose its 
ratings, citing confidentiality requirements. But the last justice without 
prior judicial experience was the controversial Rose Elizabeth Bird, whom 
voters dumped from the court in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 44, is considered smart, capable and dedicated, and her appointment 
would put both another woman and a minority on the court. She is African 
American. Justice Joyce Kennard, who is part-Indonesian, is the only woman and 
minority now on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also is personally fond of Brown, and she is believed to be headed for 
some judicial appointment, if not the Supreme Court. She advises him on a wide 
variety of legal issues, including clemency petitions.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown received her undergraduate degree from Sacramento State University and 
her law degree from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Finalist Bamattre-Manoukian, 43, has been a judge for 10 years. She was an 
Orange County prosecutor when former Gov. George Deukmejian appointed her to 
the West Orange County Municipal Court in 1983. He subsequently moved her to 
the Municipal Court and the Superior Court of Santa Clara County, elevating her 
to the Court of Appeal in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Her rulings have been viewed as strongly pro-prosecution on the criminal side 
and generally conservative on civil matters. She is friendly and well-liked. A 
Los Angeles native, she received her law degree from Loyola University and a 
bachelor's degree in political science and psychology and a Ph.D. in public 
administration from USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Chin, 51, a former prosecutor, has six years of judicial experience and knows 
Wilson personally. The California State Bar has given him its highest rating -- 
exceptionally well-qualified -- in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 He is affable and scholarly, supporting his rulings at times with citations 
from scientific and medical journals and winning wide praise for his work on 
the Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although generally conservative, he is considered more independent than some 
of the other candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 Like Chin, Ortega, 52, has won the "exceptionally well-qualified" Bar rating, 
but he has the potential disadvantage of being a Southern Californian and not 
knowing Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Huntington Beach, the conservative Ortega has been a prosecutor 
and a defense attorney. He grew up in New Mexico, earning his undergraduate 
degree from the University of New Mexico and his law degree from Georgetown 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Scotland, 47, is the only white man among the finalists. A former Deukmejian 
Cabinet secretary, Scotland served as a Sacramento prosecutor and a deputy 
state attorney general. He knows Wilson and contributed $125 to his campaign in 
1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Werdegar, 57, also is a friend of the governor. They were studying partners in 
law school at Boalt Hall at UC Berkeley. She has contributed $3,500 to his 
campaigns over the years, and he appointed her to the Court of Appeal in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 Werdegar formerly served as an associate dean and professor at the University 
of San Francisco School of Law and as a senior staff attorney to Panelli for 
six years. Panelli liked her so much that he singled her out as a possible 
replacement when he announced his retirement in September. 
</P>
<P>
 She graduated first in her law class, became the first woman to be named 
editor of the law review at UC Berkeley and has written a book on criminal law 
procedure. She is considered an independent conservative on the Court of 
Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen, who follows the Supreme Court closely, said the vacancy is bound to 
reduce the number of decisions the court writes this year because of the extra 
time it takes to communicate with substitute justices who work elsewhere in the 
state.

AID SOUGHT TO HELP PAY FOR HOLDING IMMIGRANT FELONS; SPENDING: WHITE HOUSE 
WANTS CONGRESS TO ALLOCATE $350 MILLION FOR COST OF IMPRISONING CRIMINALS WHO 
ARE IN UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under increasing pressure from states that are severely affected by illegal 
immigration, the Clinton Administration asked Congress for $350 million Friday 
to help California and other states pay the prison costs for illegal immigrants 
convicted of felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount the Administration seeks is only a fraction of those costs, but the 
action is significant because it is the first time the federal government has 
demonstrated any obligation to reimburse states for such expenses. California 
alone estimates it will spend more than $375 million next year to jail illegal 
immigrant felons. 
</P>
<P>
 To provide the money, the Administration is reaching back to the 1986 
immigration reform law, which authorized that states be reimbursed for the cost 
of imprisoning illegal immigrants. But no funds were ever appropriated under 
the program, officially called the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. 
</P>
<P>
 "No previous President has asked for funds . . . and no previous Congress has 
acted to fund (the program)," Budget Director Leon Panetta said at a midday 
briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes as members of Congress and governors of affected states 
are stepping up criticism that the federal government has lost control of its 
borders. Florida has filed a lawsuit against the Administration, seeking $1.5 
billion to help it offset the costs of providing education, health care and 
criminal justice services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, in a conference call with reporters, said the Clinton 
Administration's announcement was a "very welcome development" but not enough 
to appease him. Wilson said the state still plans to file a series of lawsuits 
against the federal government with the first, coming next week, to focus on 
prison costs. States argue that they must unfairly shoulder immigration costs 
because Washington has failed to halt illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a step," Wilson said of the Clinton move. "It's the first step on the 
journey." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the White House has been working on an immigration strategy for more 
than a year, the threat of lawsuits and recent congressional action clearly 
have turned up the political heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill approved by the House this week contains an amendment that 
would require the federal government to pay all costs of imprisoning illegal 
immigrant felons, starting in 1998. The White House is opposed to that 
approach, fearing it would create a massive new entitlement program. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said the Administration "is not supportive of new entitlements" and 
would rather see reimbursements come out of discretionary funds and be 
subjected to the annual budget process. 
</P>
<P>
 He also denied that the $350-million plan outlined Friday was hurriedly 
unveiled to dilute congressional support for the more expensive method required 
in the crime bill. The Senate bill has no such provision. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't pull off (these announcements) in a day," Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), who co-authored the crime bill 
amendment, praised the Administration for its quick response to the House 
action -- and also saw an ulterior motive. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he suspects the funding request will be used as an argument against 
keeping the House language in the final bill, which will be produced by a 
House-Senate conference committee responsible for reconciling the different 
versions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be able to say they fought for appropriations to cover these costs," 
Beilenson said. "If we can get into the habit of appropriating money every year 
(for immigration costs), that's a fairly decent argument against putting in 
entitlement language. I don't care how we get the money, as long as we get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta described the $350 million as "a ballpark figure . . . that may be 
short." A Panetta aide, Christopher F. Edley Jr., was even more candid. "It's 
at the very low end of what the costs would be." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Panetta warned that winning final legislative approval will be 
difficult in light of tight budgetary restraints. "This is the beginning of the 
battle, not the end," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson agreed: "It's going to require real leadership on the part of the 
Administration to move some of those in Congress who are not sympathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said he is skeptical because Clinton Administration officials 
have been quoted recently saying that the process of settling the immigration 
issue might take a year or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell do they expect the states to do in the meantime?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta urged that the federal and state governments form a partnership to 
rally support in Congress, particularly from states without significant illegal 
immigration problems. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the reimbursements would be directed at the seven states most 
heavily affected by illegal immigration -- California, New York, Texas, 
Florida, New Jersey, Illinois and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is still devising a formula to distribute the funds. But 
Panetta made it clear that they would be distributed roughly in proportion to 
the number of such felons in state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget office doubts the accuracy of most states' estimates of their 
illegal immigrant prison populations. Panetta said the Urban Institute would be 
asked to develop a consistent methodology to assist states in counting the 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Alan C. Miller in Washington and Daniel M. Weintraub in 
Sacramento contributed to this story.

 Danny and Susie Hernandez, a Mission Viejo society couple who illegally 
amassed a $9-million fortune and flaunted a lifestyle that became the talk of 
Orange County, were each sentenced to prison terms Friday for their roles in a 
scheme to skim precious metals. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Hernandez received a 71-month sentence, much less than prosecutors 
wanted. His wife, Susie, who had sought to serve her sentence at home, was

WILSON AIDE GETS 10 DAYS FOR DRUNK DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's campaign press secretary was sentenced Friday to 10 days in 
jail, fined $1,500 and placed on four years probation after pleading no contest 
to his second drunk driving offense in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, 30, also had his license suspended for one year and was ordered to 
attend a mandatory education program for those convicted of driving under the 
influence of alcohol, for which he must pay tuition of $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur was arrested early March 5 as he was driving home from a restaurant a 
few blocks from the state Capitol. Two breath tests showed his blood-alcohol 
level to be at least 0.13%, far above the legal limit for driving of 0.08%. 
Schnur's first drunk driving conviction was in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He will spend 48 hours in Sacramento County Jail and serve the rest of his 
sentence on a county work crew, Schnur said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Ziegaus, campaign communications director, said Schnur will keep his 
position.

BROWN KICKS OFF SMALL-BUSINESS LOAN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown put on two hats Friday, as the state's treasurer and a 
Democratic candidate for governor, to kick off a new government program for 
small businesses that helps fulfill her campaign pledge to create 1 million new 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the California Capital Access Program is partly to help fledgling 
companies get an early boost by making small-business loans easier to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown launched the program Friday at a booming 2-year-old manufacturing 
company that was having cash-flow problems and being courted by other states 
for relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am on a mission to create 1 million new jobs," Brown said in the warehouse 
of Timberline Gas Logs Co., maker of simulated logs for gas fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "By providing access to affordable loans, Cal-CAP will help many small 
businesses like Timberline get the dollars needed to expand, invest in research 
and equipment and hire workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's appearance was actually a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a program that 
she already broadcast in a news conference in January and was unveiled in 
legislation signed in October by her Republican rival, Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of Friday's event was to recognize the award of the first 
Cal-CAP assisted loan to Timberline -- for $500,000 -- and for Brown to 
underscore her pledge to create 1 million California jobs by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of more jobs was part of a new focus that Brown's campaign 
introduced at last weekend's state Democratic convention, along with a new team 
of strategists and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the announcement, however, the idea has been sharply criticized as a 
campaign gimmick by Wilson and the other Democratic candidates -- state 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's opponents noted that economists have already predicted that the 
state's economy should create 1 million jobs over the next four years no matter 
who is governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown responded to her critics Friday: "If you look back, the economic 
forecasts in 1990, 1991 said there would be 170,000 jobs created. California, 
in fact, lost double that number. So economists make forecasts just like 
weathermen, weather people, make forecasts."

EGGLESTON STATS DIDN'T ADD UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read an article by Martin Henderson on a basketball computer simulation. I 
don't believe that Brea-Olinda's girls' team could ever come close to beating 
any high school all-star team.I don't know where the statistics came from, but 
I do know one thing, and that is that Jessica Eggleston's stats must have been 
manipulated by someone. 
</P>
<P>
 When was the last time Eggleston scored two measly points in a game for 
Cypress High? She was Orange County's leading scorer for the last two years. 
She shot over 60% from the field, and you are telling me that she went 0 for 3 
in 16 minutes. I know just about any coach would keep her in the game for more 
than 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Either you have got some biased coaches, or a computer simulation that should 
be trashed. What a disgrace to one of the county's premiere athletes.

A CAREFUL PLAN FOR THE ARRIVAL OF KILLER BEES; ENTOMOLOGY: OFFICIALS STRESS 
RESPECT FOR THE PEST. TRAPS HAVE BEEN SET TO ALERT OFFICIALS WHEN THE BEES GET 
HERE, PROBABLY BY WINTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The traps are set. County crews are in training. And schoolchildren are being 
prepped about the new pest headed this way. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of Orange County's battle plan against so-called killer bees. 
County officials prefer to call them "Africanized honeybees" and say the best 
defense against these notorious bees -- expected to arrive in California any 
day now -- is a strong public education campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like rattlesnakes and black widow spiders," said Steve Hill, with the 
county's Agricultural Commission office. "We've learned to respect them and to 
keep our distance. We'll do the same thing with the Africanized bee." 
</P>
<P>
 Local agricultural and vector control workers aren't taking any chances, and 
on Tuesday their strategy to cope with the bees goes before the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors for review. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we all need to learn to live with," Hill said. "We can do that 
just by becoming educated on the bee, learning how to bee-proof our homes, and 
being aware when we're out." 
</P>
<P>
 By some estimates, the long-dreaded bees could arrive in Orange County by next 
winter, and about 20 traps have been set throughout the county to alert 
officials when they arrive. These bees have been spreading fear since they were 
accidentally released from a breeding experiment in Brazil in 1957, and already 
have established themselves in Texas and Arizona. They arrived in New Mexico in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's 27-page proposed plan -- which outlines roles for various county 
agencies in dealing with the bees -- caps about two years of preparation and 
work, similar to efforts throughout Southern California. The plan also 
anticipates that private pest-control companies would respond to non-emergency 
requests to control bee colonies. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bees pose safety concerns and can be expected to survive easily in 
urban areas where there is lush vegetation, officials say there's no reason to 
panic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to make people hysterical," said Fred Beams, assistant manager 
of the Orange County Vector Control Agency, which already fields many questions 
about bees in general. "It's not going to be something like huge clouds of bees 
coming from the sky destroying towns. That's not going to happen. But there are 
going to be some people affected by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the bees do not go out looking for trouble, most people will never 
confront them, experts say. But what makes the Africanized honeybee more 
dangerous than the common European honeybee is that they will vigorously defend 
their hives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They swarm more often, for a longer period of the year and, typically, a hive 
of Africanized honeybees can inflict 10 times as many stings on an individual 
than its European relatives," according to the county plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Both honeybees possess virtually the same venom and can only sting once, but 
Africanized bees are much more likely to swarm and attack if their colonies are 
disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of bee behavior can affect the lifestyles of Orange County 
residents, schoolchildren, the tourism industry and the business community," 
the report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 The bees have been blamed for more than 300 deaths in Venezuela and dozens of 
fatalities in other South and Central American countries. One death in Texas 
has been attributed to the bees. 
</P>
<P>
 But where public education has been the greatest, the numbers of death and 
injuries have been the lowest, the county report stresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the county plan, several agencies will be most involved in dealing with 
the bees: the county Health Care Agency, Fire Department, Emergency Management 
Division, Department of Education, Vector Control District and Environmental 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The main goals of the plan include expanding educational programs for schools 
and groups involved with students; educating health service providers who will 
assist people who get stung; coordinating public information campaigns, 
including a telephone hot line; training police officers, firefighters and 
other rescue personnel; monitoring the spread of the bees; and educating 
beekeepers on revised beekeeping practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through education and information, people can really learn to live with the 
bees," Hill said. "In fact, we're going to have to do that."

A BITTERSWEET ADDRESS; SPEECH: BARBARA BUSH, AT NIXON LIBRARY HOURS BEFORE 
EX-PRESIDENT'S DEATH, REMINISCES ABOUT HIM AND LATE WIFE PAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a rare public appearance, former First Lady Barbara Bush spoke Friday at 
the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace, saying that her prayers were with the 
37th President. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, whose appearance and speech had been scheduled long before Nixon's 
Monday stroke, entertained 1,200 people with anecdotes from her four years in 
the White House. But before talking about state dinners and the sense of peace 
she has attained in private life, she reminisced about her friendship with 
Nixon and his wife Pat, who died last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely important that we all gather together at the Nixon Library to 
celebrate Pat and Dick Nixon. He's on all of our minds," Bush said some hours 
before the former President's death was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush recalled the numerous times Nixon offered advice and support to her, 
especially when the then-First Lady and President George Bush felt besieged by 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
 During the controversy over whether homemaker Barbara Bush should deliver the 
commencement address at Wellesley College, an all-women's school in 
Massachusetts, "the best letter I received was from Dick Nixon," she recalled. 
"He said he was outraged, and that I should go out there and give them hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Bush spoke, John Taylor, director of the Nixon Library & Birthplace, 
said he was pleased that Bush agreed to speak despite Nixon's condition. Taylor 
asked the audience to remember the Nixon family, telling them that Nixon was 
"still fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said that Nixon had given a thumbs-up sign to the doctors who were 
treating him before he fell into the deep coma from which he never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Nixon liked to quote Sophocles, that 'one must wait until the evening 
to know how splendid the day was.' Monday evening at home, as he sat on the 
back deck enjoying the evening, Richard Nixon was reflecting on how splendid 
the past few weeks have been," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bush's remarks, members of the predominantly female audience praised her 
effort. Hilda Panhorst of Yorba Linda said Bush was "natural and unassuming." 
</P>
<P>
 Others lauded her promotion of "family values," saying her homey integrity and 
the sense of caring she displays are in short supply today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a longtime admirer of Barbara Bush," said Jean Beck, 80, of 
Whittier. "I'm privileged to be here. I don't think she could do anything 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush regaled the audience with stories about her White House years, including 
the time Boris Yeltsin teased her when she stepped on his foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking much the same as she did during her four years in the White House, 
dressed in a conservative peach suit with her hair well-coiffed, Bush said she 
and her husband have adjusted easily to private life, thankful that the days of 
heavy responsibility and constant media attention are over. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, when curious people approach her in the grocery store, asking if 
she's Barbara Bush, she says, "Oh, no, I'm much younger than she is." 
</P>
<P>
 After Bush's 40-minute address and a private luncheon, the library's museum 
section was reopened, but the gardens and Pat Nixon's burial site remained 
closed.

BOY, 7, FATALLY HURT LEAVING SCHOOL BUS; ACCIDENT: THE CHILD, WHO WAS RIDING IN 
THE VEHICLE FOR THE FIRST DAY, IS STRUCK BY PICKUP WHILE DARTING ACROSS STREET 
TOWARD FRIENDS.

<P>
 A 7-year-old boy riding a school bus for the first day was killed Friday when 
he got off and darted into traffic on Aliso Niguel Road, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lanni, of Laguna Niguel was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center, where he died at 7:32 p.m. Friday. The boy's parents were with him, a 
school official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child, a first-grader at Marian Bergeson Elementary School in Laguna 
Niguel, was struck by a pickup at 3:18 p.m. as he tried to run across the 
street toward some friends, Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Jay Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because all the children who get off the bus at that stop live on the same 
side of the street, Mendez said, the bus was not flashing its lights and 
traffic was not required to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the pickup, following behind the bus, had crossed the center 
line of the road as a precaution, Mendez said, but was unable to stop in time. 
The driver was not cited. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those unfortunate accidents," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Price, speaking for the Capistrano Unified School District, said 
the boy's family had just moved to the area. Friday was his second day at 
school and his first day riding the bus, Price said. On Thursday, his parents 
had dropped him off at school and picked him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he got off the bus, he saw some friends on the opposite side of the 
street, and he ran out in front of the bus to see them," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime that there is an accident that involves any one of our students, 
particularly a young child, we view it as a real tragedy for our entire 
community," Price said. "Our thoughts and our best wishes are with the family 
of this child. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a reminder to all children and their parents of the importance of 
being aware of safety practices, in terms of crossing streets and exiting 
school buses or cars or anytime you're in a traffic situation," she added. "We 
can never reinforce that enough as adults with our children."

JUANENOS ARE STEADILY LEARNING CULTURAL HERITAGE OF TRIBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE TASSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a given day, a group of Juaneno Native Americans will gather to study their 
native language, basket-making or beading in a room filled with pictures of 
ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 Others convene at a local beach to perform a healing ceremony or visit the 
schools to teach students the history of a people who were here before the 
Spaniards as well as the other white settlers who arrived many years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Juaneno might be monitoring a construction site to see if ancestral 
artifacts are dug up or eating fry-bread and socializing at a powwow like the 
one today and Sunday at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which last year drew more than 
</P>
<P>
 10,000 people, is hosted by the Native American Student Organization and 
features singing, dancing, handcrafted art and food. Laguna Pueblo, Sioux, 
Apache and Navajo Native Americans are performing traditional music on drums. 
</P>
<P>
 While the state-recognized Juaneno band strives to achieve federal 
recognition, its members also labor to discover their own heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Indian Council member Teeter Romero, 59, puts it this way: "In 1975 
we decided to get together and do something about (reclaiming our history), or 
it would be gone forever. We started working at it, and we started looking at 
the history and talking to the older people, asking questions and getting 
answers. Everyone wants to find a part of their roots, and they're willing to 
put in the time to do what they have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 With some 3,000 tribal members in the country, about 300 Juanenos now live in 
San Juan Capistrano, a city of about 27,000. In 1776, the Juaneno tribe, in 
what is now San Juan Capistrano, was forced to convert to Catholicism after a 
group of Franciscan missionaries arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The community was reminded of its Juaneno origins Wednesday during the 
poignant funeral procession for Evelyne Marine Lobo Villegas, the city's 
beloved matriarch and a strong voice for remembering the Juaneno past. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, from one of the oldest families in San Juan Capistrano, learned from 
her grandmother a pride in being Native American. She learned to play a game 
called "Duck on a Pond" and rode horses. But she never got to experience her 
tribe's uniqueness, because there was so little to draw from, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's changing now. The mother of three and a waitress and housekeeper at a 
retirement home insists: "We do want our children and our children's children 
to know our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 So she goes to nighttime spiritual ceremonies at the beach, sometimes at the 
beginning of summer to mark planting season. Other ceremonies are for healing, 
and in 1991, there was one to bury Native American bones, for which Romero 
spent more than a year learning special dances and how to wrap the bones in 
keeping with ancient traditions.  
</P>
<P>
 People fast for purification before the ceremony, which doesn't begin until 
someone spots a dolphin in the ocean. Then there is dancing, singing and 
showing reverence to ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiritually, she is largely self-taught. "When it comes to Indian things, it 
comes easy. It just seems like when you start to do something, like when we're 
doing a ceremony for the first time, we know exactly what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 She said ceremonies are rarely talked about with those who don't participate. 
"These things are very special to us. Just because people don't hear of them 
doesn't mean they're not happening." 
</P>
<P>
 The Juanenos in San Juan Capistrano have also formed two groups that hold 
monthly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 One group is active in political issues, and the other, the Capistrano Indian 
Council, has such cultural and artistic pursuits as a monthly "living history" 
demonstration at Mission San Juan Capistrano. Council members also appear at 
schools to teach the culture. 
</P>
<P>
 During one recent council meeting, 30 people sat on folding chairs in the main 
room of the Harrison House on Ortega Highway. Attendees included Al Flores, the 
great-grandson of Anastacia Davis, who wrote down the tribe's Ajachame dialect, 
and the children of the late matriarch Villegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also discussed upcoming cultural events, shared their newsletter, 
conducted a drawing for a Native American doll, and talked about the old days 
over a potluck dinner of corn soup, fried chicken, stew and casseroles. 
</P>
<P>
 The same room is used for the group's Tuesday basket-weaving class, where 
Juaneno Marian Walkingstick showed newcomers how to turn pine needles and 
raffia into bowls and containers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think bringing basketry to the council was major . . . because we really 
didn't have anything to draw from," Walkingstick said. "We don't know about art 
from our ancestors. I take from the other tribes and anyone who has anything to 
offer." Her passion for the work is so strong that "my creative part of me just 
goes crazy after awhile." 
</P>
<P>
 While similar artwork is popped out by machines at factories, Walkingstick, 
57, spends about seven hours a day in her at-home workroom, painstakingly 
making baskets, cloth dolls, beaded purses, flowers, rattles, and jewelry by 
hand, mostly by teaching herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Walkingstick's art has given her the opportunity to rediscover her own roots. 
"You get to an age when you want to know about your heritage," she says, and 
art is how she has reclaimed it.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a big part of my life -- I couldn't be without it. It's like being 
Juaneno. It's always going to be there."

TEEN SEEKS TO BE VOICE FOR REFUGEES IN CAMPS; IMMIGRATION: THE VIETNAMESE 
ORPHAN 'REPRESENTS A HUMAN DIMENSION TO THE TRAGEDY OF THE BOAT PEOPLE,' RIGHTS 
ACTIVIST SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ngo Van Ha is a 16-year-old orphan who speaks little English. But next week, 
he will testify before a congressional subcommittee, and what he has to say may 
yet influence national policy on the estimated 50,000 Vietnamese "boat people" 
still languishing in refugee camps in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Local refugee rights activists say the frail teen-ager, barely 5 feet tall, 
personalizes what they describe as a continuing tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He presents a human dimension to the tragedy of the boat people," said Van 
Tran of the Westminster chapter of the Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum 
Seekers, which provides legal services for refugees. "If a pale child can speak 
before a powerful committee, it will send a message to the authorities running 
the camps." 
</P>
<P>
 Ha arrived in the United States April 12 after spending four years at a Hong 
Kong refugee camp, where he became a celebrity of sorts by surviving repeated 
attempts by the Hong Kong government and the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees to send him back to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Ha was orphaned at age 10, when his parents died in a bus accident in Vietnam. 
He lived with relatives until he was 12, then fled Vietnam by boat with 35 
other people and wound up in the Hong Kong refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the High Commissioner for Refugees attempted to send Ha back to 
Vietnam, but his relatives there did not want him because they could not afford 
to raise him. 
</P>
<P>
 The relatives who did want him -- a distant aunt and uncle in San Gabriel -- 
were not allowed to bring him to the United States until a barrage of publicity 
in the Hong Kong media and efforts by lawyers from refugee rights groups forced 
the High Commissioner for Refugees to grant him refugee status. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ha wants to be the voice of those left behind in the refugee camps, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to speak about the conditions in the refugee camps," he said through 
an interpreter before leaving for Washington on Friday. "I want to repay those 
who have helped and took care of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ha is one of 13 Indochinese refugees who will appear before the House 
Subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific Affairs, which is investigating cases 
involving Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong and Hmong refugees in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the U.S. State Department and the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees will also testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional leaders want to find out if there is an "institutional bias" in 
the way certain cases, especially those involving children, are being handled 
by U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees investigators screening refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugee advocates said they hope that Ha's testimony will also help stop the 
forced repatriation of refugees to Vietnam and speed up the screening process 
for those seeking asylum in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an immigration issue but a human rights issue," said Lan Nguyen, 
a LAVAS attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen said that at a time of strong anti-immigrant sentiments, it is hard to 
overcome negative public perception about refugees. And while LAVAS is 
advocating the resettlement of refugees, it is not suggesting that they all be 
resettled in the United States, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public has to be educated about the abuse the refugees are suffering 
at the camps, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many refugees are summarily denied refugee status, Nguyen said. In an effort 
to empty the camps, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the host 
countries have removed health clinics and other services, triggering protest 
from refugees that sometimes end in violence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the Southeast Asian Resource Action Center in Washington, which 
provides medical and other services to refugees, reported that Hong Kong police 
used tear gas to break up a group of nearly 2,000 protesting refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner Blatter, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees bureau director for 
Asia and Oceania, met with Vietnamese community leaders this year in several 
American cities. In his Jan. 14 meeting with Orange County Vietnamese leaders, 
he said that the problems of violence and medical care in the camps will be 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ha, the Tai A Chau refugee camp in Hong Kong was both a home and a prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would look beyond the barbed wires and hope that I could go outside," he 
said. "But I didn't think of going back to Vietnam. I had no family in Vietnam. 
I had no place to live. My parents were dead." 
</P>
<P>
 After his parents died in 1985, Ha said that he and his two brothers and a 
sister lived with an uncle, who had children of his own, in Nha Trang. Ha's 
elder brother left Vietnam and is now in a refugee camp in the Philippines, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ha said that he tried to leave Vietnam at least 20 times. He was arrested 
twice, but was finally successful in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 At the camp, Ha foraged for food with the other children. He said breakfast 
consisted of watered-down milk and a slice of bread. "If you sleep late, you 
don't eat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch was a tiny piece of meat, pickled cabbage, rice and soup. Supper was 
meat, or fish, and rice. There were curfews and roll calls, like a prison, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees tried to send Ha back to 
Vietnam to live with his uncle under a policy that requires children to be 
reunited with their families or closest relatives, even if it means sending 
them back to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Ha refused to go, and for four months, Hong Kong police hunted for him at the 
Tai A Chau detention camp. He eluded arrest by wearing disguises, hiding under 
beds and using the other refugees as lookouts. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was finally captured and transferred to another camp in preparation to 
being sent back to Vietnam, the 2,000 detainees at the Tai A Chau camp went on 
a hunger strike in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Ha's exploits landed in the Hong Kong media and got the attention of a Hong 
Kong lawyer, Pam Baker, who offered free legal services to prevent his forced 
return to Vietnam. She contacted Ha's uncle and aunt in San Gabriel -- Vu and 
Tuyet Ho Nguyen -- and asked them to take the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker eventually persuaded Jahanshah Assadi, the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees chief of mission in Hong Kong, to grant Ha refugee status and allow 
him to join his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I stepped out of the plane, I thought I was in heaven," Ha said. "This 
is my dream, to come to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 His relatives were just as excited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled," said Lori Nguyen, 15, Ha's cousin. "He's like a new brother. 
And it's neat because all my older brothers are going to college." 
</P>
<P>
 Ha said that his main concern now is to get an education. He said that facing 
a congressional hearing does not scare him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm comfortable," said Ha, who learned a little English at the camps. "I've 
seen more scary things before." Home in Camps More than 57,000 Vietnamese 
refugees remain in camps, chiefly in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Where they 
are: Hong Kong: 51% Indonesia: 17% Philippines: 8% Thailand: 11% Malaysia: 13% 
Note: A few are also in Singapore and Macao. Source: Southeast Asian Resource

HIS BEAT IS FIX-IT MEN WHO TINKER WITH BILL; CRIME: LITERATE IN THE LANGUAGE OF 
ELECTRONICS, ZEFFERINO LOPEZ CATCHES CROOKS WHO GOUGE CONSUMERS FOR PHONY 
REPAIRS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It is a lonely beat that Zefferino Lopez pounds, a singular life that other 
cops might regard as . . . well . . . funny. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you repair appliances or electronic gizmos, you're not laughing when 
Lopez walks through the door of your shop. You give him the grudging respect 
you would a Columbo or a Kojak. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Lopez is a police officer of sorts. He's a gray-suited investigator 
for the tiny state Bureau of Electronic and Appliance Repair, a Joe Friday-like 
gumshoe on the lookout for screwdriver-packing shysters who each year rip off 
thousands of unsuspecting Californians through fraudulent appliance repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of eight such investigators statewide, Lopez uses tactics right out of the 
police book: He conducts undercover stings of suspect repair shops, planting 
bogus TVs that have been previously dismantled in some state lab, each part 
marked as evidence for some possible future court trial. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a hound on the trail of the Repairmen From Hell -- unscrupulous 
experts-turned-thieves who operate from post office boxes, slipshod workmen who 
bungle jobs so badly they turn refrigerators into steamy saunas where soda cans 
explode like blasting caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez even talks in cop jargon, using phrases like video cameras or stereos 
"coming up dirty" and saying that if good repairmen go bad, he's going to have 
to "take them down." 
</P>
<P>
 Because when it comes to phony fix-it jobs, this detective trusts no one, not 
even the Maytag repairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get around," he says of a patrol territory stretching from West Hollywood 
north to Santa Barbara. "And I tell these electronic and appliance repair guys 
that they had better watch their backs. Because the next television they repair 
might be one of mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, he plays the sucker, the suburban homeowner who doesn't know a picture 
tube from a volume control, rigging TV sets and appliances with simple defects 
that the technician should be able to spot and fix in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble follows if he gets a bill for an elaborate repair the appliance didn't 
really need. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, a former TV repairman, will retire in May after 23 years of looking 
over the shoulders of technicians paid to make gadgets work right again -- a 
career in which he returned to his former industry to play double agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This industry has a bad reputation, right there above auto mechanics in the 
professions people mistrust," he said. "There's a small percentage of 
fly-by-nighters willing to rip anybody off. They keep me in business." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, electronics is big business. American consumers last year spent an 
estimated $30 billion on new home electronic equipment -- including 
televisions, VCRs and video cameras. In California alone, according to 
electronic industry statistics, consumers spend about $1 billion more each year 
on repairs to keep them working. 
</P>
<P>
 And when their equipment fails, owners look for quick solutions: They scan the 
telephone book for an easy reference to a neighborhood repair technician -- not 
all of whom are Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Lopez comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the general public -- known as "laymen" in the electronic and appliance 
repair industry -- Lopez does not hear some difficult foreign language when 
technicians start talking about circuit breakers and display monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "My background in the business puts the shop owner at ease. He knows that I 
know what I'm taking about," says the 60-year-old Arizona native. "On the other 
hand, he can't pull any fast ones. I've caught so many repairmen in 
misstatements, where their eyes get real wide and they say, 'Oh, so you know 
about repairs.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Operating on a shoestring $1.6-million budget, the appliance repair bureau 
employs no taxpayer dollars -- instead using funds from the $130 annual 
registration assessed the state's 8,260 repair shops. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, investigators like Lopez -- all of whom have a background in electronic 
repair -- get results. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting largely on complaints, the bureau last year claimed $113,000 in refunds 
for overcharged consumers. Nine technicians had their operating licenses 
revoked due to incompetence or negligence, and misdemeanor criminal charges 
were brought against an additional 15 businesses. Three of them went to jail, 
under sentences ranging up to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Begun in 1964 in response to pressure from electronic and appliance repair 
specialists looking for government help in policing themselves, the bureau has 
the backing of an industry that applauds the arrests of truly crooked 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should realize these types are a minority who give the rest of us a 
bad name," said Eloy Fierro, president of the California State Electronics 
Assn. and owner of Consumer Video Service in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys should be hung, no doubt about it. . . . We want them closed down 
as badly as consumers do." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes operators like Joseph Jacob Arnold, whose A Speedy Major 
Appliance Repair of Studio City brought at least 37 complaints from suspicious 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the bureau revoked Arnold's license for allegedly collecting 
"non-refundable" down payments for repair work that was never completed. He has 
since fled the state, officials say. Complaints became so commonplace that 
investigators nicknamed Arnold's business "A Seedy Major Appliance Repair." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is also on the trail of electronic ne'er-do-wells, including several 
Valley repair businesses that solicit money up front for work never done, 
leaving behind only a post office box and scores of duped customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's got to be some ethics involved, some standards," he says. "If not, 
who can blame the public for not trusting anyone?" 
</P>
<P>
 Decades after he dismantled and rebuilt his own transistor radio at age 10, 
Lopez is full of consumer tips on how to avoid becoming a repair victim. 
</P>
<P>
 First, avoid appealing to the first technician you find. "TVs and 
refrigerators, these are emotional products," he says. "People want them fixed 
right away. And so they open up the Yellow Pages and scan to the first 
good-looking ad they see. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of this advertising is misleading. More often than not, you're making a 
mistake by relying on these ads. Because you're bound to meet the Repairman 
From Hell." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, consult product manufacturers for a referral to an approved repair 
technician -- most of whom are better-trained than workers at mom-and-pop 
businesses. While there are many reputable small repair shops throughout Los 
Angeles, larger businesses that pay technicians an hourly salary have less 
incentive for dishonesty than smaller owner-operated concerns, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing you don't want to fall prey to is the mentality that the thing has 
to be fixed today -- the repairman at your home who says, 'Ma'am, I got the 
part right out there in my truck. All you have to do is say the word.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A call to the Better Business Bureau -- or to friends who have frequented the 
repair shop -- can also steer a would-be victim away from trouble. Better yet, 
Lopez says, a visit to the shop without the broken item is a good way to get 
the feel of a technician's knowledge of a particular problem, by asking 
questions about the problem and looking over the operation for signs of 
slipshod habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point," he says, "is to do your homework." 
</P>
<P>
 As well, consumers should budget funds ahead of time for such repairs: 
"Repairs are not cheap, even for work done by honest businessmen," he said. "A 
television picture tube that might have cost $200 a decade ago can run as much 
as $1,300 today." 
</P>
<P>
 With many television repairs, however, there are two sides to the story. 
</P>
<P>
 In more than one-third of the 30 complaints he investigates each month, Lopez 
says, he finds that the consumer has been unreasonable -- like the woman who 
badgered both a manufacturer and the repairman for so many months over a faulty 
TV that they gave her cash and a new TV set just to get her off their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are Consumers From Hell, too," he says. "Much of the time I am caught 
in the middle of irresolvable problems where I can't make either party happy. 
There are threats of consumer lawsuits, repairmen who are offended because I 
questioned their ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being a mediator. It's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and fellow investigator Larry Moore, who operates out of Orange County, 
follow a simple principle: Most repair workers are honest Joes. Some make 
stupid mistakes. And a small minority are thieves waiting for the would-be 
victim to walk through their door. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lopez, the most satisfying aspect of the job is conducting sting 
operations to catch the real lawbreakers, playing the rube who doesn't know the 
first thing about electronic repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Or cases like the Woodland Hills caper in which the bureau used its own 
employees to play the role of a couple with a hopelessly broken television, a 
sting that eventually led to criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owner Fierro says the public has a critical role in keeping his industry 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of people are quick to respond to these flyers and come-ons that 
guarantee some rock-bottom price, the ones that literally promise to do the job 
for free as long as you let them inside the house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of that is just plain fraud. But if you're a consumer just out to save a 
buck, you become prey to these guys. And you're gonna get zapped." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so Lopez is handing over the investigator's baton to another 
former-repairman-turned-detective, teaching him the ropes, the lessons he 
learned in two decades of ferreting out soldering-iron bandits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some things I've tried to get across to him," Lopez says with a 
smile. "For one, not everything is as it seems. And another is not to jump the 
gun. Listen to both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 And how about the oldest adage of all: There's a sucker born every minute? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," he says. "And that includes myself. Nobody is immune."

PART OF THE SOLUTION; 700 VALLEY SCHOOLCHILDREN SPEND EARTH DAY CLEANING UP 
BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-five years after the first Earth Day was born in a swell of national 
concern for the environment, many of the adults who lived through it now feel 
helpless to remedy the still smoggy skies, polluted waters and endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 But not the 4,000 Los Angeles-area children who came out to clean Dockweiler 
State Beach and Long Beach City Beach on Friday, this year's Earth Day. Not 
only do they believe there is a solution, they believe they are part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a hazy blue sky, 12-year-old Jindry Acosta of Sylmar knelt on the damp 
sand near the water's edge and poked at a piece of kelp with a gloved hand. 
"There's oil stuck on it," he said as he examined the blackened seaweed. 
"People have to stop doing it. A lot of animals are dying. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people could die, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The children, including 700 from the San Fernando Valley, collected tons of 
litter and debris on the beaches as part of the Adopt-A-Beach program overseen 
by the Malibu Foundation for Environmental Education and the California 
Department of Conservation. The children had collected for recycling more than 
150,000 bottles and cans this school year to pay for their bus rides to the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Their funds were matched by a grant from the Department of Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the buses rolled into the Dockweiler parking lot from Van Nuys, Sylmar, 
Burbank, Pacoima and other locations throughout the city, hundreds of 
green-shirted Los Angeles Conservation Corps members jumped aboard with litter 
bags and plastic gloves and instructions for the children. Then the buses 
headed for cleanup sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Velinda Pelayo, a sixth-grader at Harding Street Elementary School in Sylmar, 
sat in a window seat gazing at the ocean, anxious to get started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to take care of the Earth so we can live a better life," she said. 
"There won't be any more trash if we pick up most of it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the children finally reached their spots, they hit the beach, armed with 
sea-green bags for recyclables and royal-blue ones for trash. They spread out 
across the beige sand, a sea of bright hats and colorful T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 They picked up cigarette butts, bits of styrofoam and surf-worn glass. They 
found needles, a baby bottle, plastic straws and even a piece of what was once 
a city sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers knew that the 4,000 eager children could not dramatically change 
the face of the beach, marred even from a distance by white dots of plastic and 
styrofoam. But they hoped the awareness spurred by the classroom lessons and 
the massive cleanup would spread from the children to families, friends and 
fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is to the adults," said program organizer Michael Klubock, a 
former sailor who created the program. "The whole goal is that the community 
sees kids caring about the environment and follows their lead." 
</P>
<P>
 The Adopt-A-Beach Cleanup was the first of about 50 events that will take 
place across the city this weekend as part of the third annual Great L.A. 
Cleanup, including projects in the wetlands, the dunes and the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a break on a bench with a group of friends, third-grader Gharieb 
Elsayed surveyed the beach in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks a little better," he said. "If we all work together we can probably 
do it. The beach is a fun place to go but it's not fun when there's too much 
trash." 
</P>
<P>
 Back where they began, the children ate lunch in roped-off areas, forming the 
letters to spell CLEAN UP L.A. with their bodies. As a Coast Guard helicopter 
flew overhead, the children waved and chanted: "Clean up L.A. Clean up L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirsten Pressman, who formed the bottom of the letter "L" with her sixth-grade 
classmates from Harding, suddenly burst into the chorus of "We Are the World."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 840 ATHLETES TAKE PART IN FALEY GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An enthusiastic high five awaited a smiling Leah Levi as she crossed the 
50-yard dash finish line Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Leah, 7, was among 840 developmentally disabled students from throughout 
Orange County who participated in the ninth annual Kathleen E. Faley Memorial 
Special Games at Cal State Fullerton. The games -- where everyone is a winner 
-- are named in honor of Kathleen Faley, who died in a car accident eight years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all get hugs and blue ribbons," said Jack Faley, who organizes the games 
each year in memory of his daughter. It was her suggestion in 1986 that 
inspired her brother, Dan, to start the games as a class project. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jack Faley and his family organize the games, volunteers, businesses and 
corporations help make the day a success. "We all get an exhilarating feeling," 
said Faley, of Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 The excitement was especially high for the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Rodriguez, a 14-year-old special education student at Dale Junior High 
School in Anaheim, threw a softball at a target with all her might while seated 
in her wheelchair. She hit the target and gave a wide grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never did that before," she said. "It felt pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers also expressed satisfaction. Charlotte Vera, an 18-year-old Rosary 
High School student volunteer from Fullerton, spent the day screaming, "Good 
job!" as the youngsters completed their races. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to see these kids so happy," Vera said. "They're just like us. There's 
no difference. We're all kids at heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Other volunteers, which included high school and college students from 
throughout the county, agreed. "It doesn't matter who you are, kids like this 
need to have attention paid to them because they really are special," said Ray 
Martinez, 17, a volunteer and Troy High School student from Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers who accompanied the athletes said the event gave their students a 
boost in self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids really do love competition but there's very few opportunities for 
them to compete," said Kay Elliott, a special education instructor from John O. 
Tynes Elementary School in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Frazier, a special-education teacher from Anaheim, cheered loudly as his 
students shot basketballs. "They're having loads of fun and they get to 
interact with other students, disabled and not." 
</P>
<P>
 There were 90 participants in the first year, and Faley said he expects more 
than 1,000 next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just keeps growing every year," said Paul Miller, Cal State Fullerton's 
director of disabled student services. "It's a really terrific outpouring of 
love and support for a very special group of our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Faley: "This is what it's all about, why we were put here on Earth: to 
help other people."MIMI KO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; CHILDREN GET A HANDS-ON LEGAL LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday was just like any other day in Division 118 of Van Nuys Municipal Court 
-- with a few exceptions. The judge was a cherub-cheeked, pony-tailed 
fifth-grader named Maya. The jurors swung their feet as they sat in their 
swivel chairs, and the bailiff stood 4-feet, 5-inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it was not a specialized legal case involving the altitudinally 
challenged. Rather, it was a mock trial put on by fifth-grade students from 
Wilbur Avenue Elementary School as part of a program intended to expose them to 
the inner workings of a real courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The third annual Day at Van Nuys Courthouse was sponsored by the San Fernando 
Valley Women Lawyers Assn. in honor of Law Day, May 1, a national event 
celebrating the importance of law in American society. On Friday, students sat 
in on arraignments and other courtroom procedures, learned about their 
constitutional rights and talked with trial lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The field trip was the culmination of a six-week learning unit at the Tarzana 
school about the American court system and the U. S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with a talk by Encino defense lawyer Malka Tasoff, who discussed 
defendants' rights -- such as the right to not incriminate themselves -- and 
the concepts behind legal terms, such as plea bargain and bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Tasoff came up with the idea for the children's courthouse visits and 
continues to coordinate the program. Tarzana Deputy City Atty. Jeffrey M. 
Harkavy was one of several volunteer lawyers who escorted groups of students.  
</P>
<P>
 "They asked if it was true that some kids had accidentally been locked up in 
jail" on previous visits, Harkavy said, incredulous. "I told them I hadn't 
heard that." 
</P>
<P>
 Other students asked where Erik and Lyle Menendez had been tried for the 
slayings of their wealthy parents. The children were surprisingly well-versed 
in the facts of the notorious case, which was heard next door in Van Nuys 
Superior Court. "I was impressed," Harkavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were quiet and well-behaved when they observed court proceedings in 
other divisions at the courthouse, but squirmed and fidgeted during long 
speeches by legal professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 And near-pandemonium broke out when a bailiff led the students on a tour of a 
holding cell. Ten- and 11-year-olds squealed with enthusiasm, flushed the 
toilet and danced on a bench in the cell. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mock trial, the highlight of the day's events, a student played the 
role of television character Bart Simpson, accused of painting graffiti on a 
classroom wall. Classmates played the roles of judge, jury, prosecutor, defense 
lawyer and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as in real life, lawyers called witnesses and raised objections 
throughout the mock trial. Judge Maya Cohen admonished attorneys to "keep it 
short" and made witnesses swear to tell the truth and nothing but. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking over from student "lawyer" Turner Lange, former Los Angeles County 
Public Defender Wilbur Littlefield delivered the closing arguments in Simpson's 
defense. Howard Waco, a real deputy public defender, did the honors for the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat surprisingly, jurors found Simpson guilty, even though the 
prosecutors had built their case on circumstantial evidence and doubts were 
raised about the motives of a key prosecution witness.  
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, students said they believed the U. S. justice system 
worked most of the time, but isn't perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look at this trial," said Martine Edwards. Gesturing in the direction of 
the already-empty jury box, she chastised jurors for voting to convict Bart 
Simpson too hastily. "They didn't have any proof. They didn't stay in there 
long enough," she said. KAY HWANGBO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; OCTA URGED TO KEEP DIAL-A-RIDE SERVICE

<P>
 Saying that many senior citizens depend on Dial-A-Ride service, the City 
Council has passed a resolution urging the Orange County Transportation 
Authority not to reduce that form of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA is proposing to discontinue Dial-A-Ride's door-to-door service for 
senior citizens.The proposal, scheduled to be voted on by the OCTA next month, 
would be effective in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach officials are opposing the proposed cutback. 
</P>
<P>
 In a resolution unanimously approved this week, the council said the loss of 
Dial-A-Ride "will impact the senior population of our city who have physical 
limitations and will create safety issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan said he had talked to many residents of the city 
"and they are extremely concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 He charged that the transportation authority is not fully considering the 
impact of its proposed cutback. "This is very shortsighted on the part of 
people at OCTA," Sullivan said.BILL BILLITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed to add a work-study session on the fourth Monday 
of each month to its schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the council, Deputy City Administrator Richard Barnard 
recommended the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council agenda items have become more complex, and the amount of 
time needed by the City Council to deliberate on agenda items has expanded," 
Barnard said. "At the work session, the City Council can spend time studying 
the details of projects or issues and provide direction to staff." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 2 to add the new meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the work-study sessions are not designed for taking votes or 
holding public hearings. Instead, the meetings will be devoted to discussion 
between council members and city staff, the officials said. BILL BILLITER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY GETS INVOLVED IN CHILDREN'S ACTIVITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calabasas officials, eager to expand activities for children but hesitant to 
increase the city's administrative costs, have decided to oversee a private 
camp and after-school day-care program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of reinventing the wheel, I figure we should work together with the 
program that already exists," said Greg Johnson, director of community 
services."This way, the city gets involved in quality control and can help the 
activities grow." 
</P>
<P>
 By mutual consent, the city earlier this month began oversight of Kids Club, 
which offers summer and winter camps, as well as after-school supervision at 
Lupin Hill, Chaparral, Bay Laurel and Round Meadow elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no significant extra costs to the city, which gets 10% of Kids 
Club's gross receipts within the city, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids Club has a great reputation," he said. "But I've heard parents say they 
like the idea that the city will have an active role in what is going on. It 
gives the program a little more credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The after-school program already serves about 350 youngsters, Johnson said, 
but may be expanded with the recent addition of classroom trailers at Lupin 
Hill and Round Meadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Program supervisors, many of whom are present or former Pepperdine University 
students, provide sports equipment, crafts, homework assistance, and other 
services and activities to children whose parents are unable to pick them up 
from school right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids can get outside and play, or they can sit in a quiet place for 
reading and homework," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged anyone seeking information on after-school programs and camps or 
other activities to call the Calabasas Community Services Department at (818) 
878-4225. KURT PITZER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; NO FRAUD FOUND IN CITY CONTRACT AWARD

<P>
 A police investigation into a poison-pen letter aimed at high-ranking city 
officials did not turn up the writer's identity but did clear city officials of 
the anonymous charges of conspiracy and fraud, the Police Department has 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Allan L. Roeder asked the police on April 4 to look into 
allegations that he and other city officials worked improperly to award a 
$100,000 computer consulting contract to a Newport Beach firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council was originally scheduled to consider a contract with AEF 
Systems Consulting on April 4 but postponed a discussion until May 2 because of 
the police investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigator George Wilson announced Friday that he has investigated the 
process by which city staff members selected the consulting firm and found it 
to be proper. He said he interviewed city employees but could not determine the 
identity of the writer of the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder said he had been confident that the allegations were untrue but had 
wanted the police to provide an independent verification. 
</P>
<P>
 Communications Director Vincent M. Whelan said he had recommended that the 
city contract with AEF because other cities had recommended the company highly. 
The city need not have open bidding for professional consulting services, City 
Atty. Thomas Kathe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant was to be hired to help the city decide what kind of computer 
system to buy. The system, which will manage all city information, could cost 
from $3 million to $7 million, Whelan said.WILLSON CUMMER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven new officers joined the Police Department at a swearing-in ceremony this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The new officers increase the number of sworn officers in the city to 123 -- 
seven officers shy of the 130 that would bring the department to full strength, 
said Police Chief Charles S. Brobeck. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has expressed its desire to fill the department's seven 
remaining vacancies by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brobeck said that the increased staffing will bolster the department's 
investigative units. During the staff shortage, investigators were transferred 
to street duty in an effort to avoid reductions in the number officers on 
patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going help us get back on track," Brobeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new officers are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Allan Sokyra, a former San Bernardino County sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Pickowitz, a former reserve firefighter with the Cathedral City Fire 
Department and security officer for Westin Hills Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nicola Erb, who worked for the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 * Julia Engen, who has worked as a civilian employee at the Orange County 
jail. She attended the Orange County sheriff's academy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Randy Lack, a former Los Angeles police officer. He holds a degree from Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jeff Van Der Sluys Veer, who worked for the Monterey County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jane Fratus, a civilian traffic investigator for the Irvine Police 
Department since 1986.SHELBY GRAD

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; MAN GETS 9 MONTHS FOR FIRING INTO SKY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Reseda gang member who fired a gun outside a party has been sentenced to 
nine months in jail.  
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Court Commissioner Mitchell Block imposed the sentence 
Thursday on Jose Francisco Mata, who was convicted of one misdemeanor count of 
grossly negligent discharge of a firearm, said Deputy City Atty.Debra Siedorf 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to send the message that firing a gun, even if it's true that he 
fired it into the sky, is an act that we won't tolerate in this city," Siedorf 
said. "The bullets could come down and hit someone." 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum sentence is one year in County Jail, but prosecutors requested the 
shorter term because Mata did not have an extensive criminal record, Siedorf 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police observed Mata firing a .38-caliber revolver four times outside a party 
in Pacoima on March 20, she said. Mata also was sentenced to another 30 days in 
jail for driving with a suspended license, which police discovered during his 
arrest, she said. TRACEY KAPLAN

 Police were looking Friday for an unusually tall man who robbed a Canoga Park 
man by posing as an FBI agent.  
</P>
<P>
 The impostor, described as a 6-feet-11, 160-pound blond man in his 30s, forced 
his way Thursday into an apartment in the 7300 block of Milwood Avenue, said 
Los Angeles Police Sgt. Mike Arroyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pushed open the door and said to the 82-year-old victim, 'I'm the FBI. 
Show me some ID,' " Arroyo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim promptly handed his wallet to the robber, who removed $365, then 
threw the wallet down and fled, Arroyo said. Police surmise that although the 
con man did not know the victim, he may have learned that he carried that much 
cash by following him, Arroyo said. TRACEY KAPLAN

<P>
 A nonprofit transportation association has received a top award for its work 
encouraging San Fernando Valley employees to car-pool to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth's 12th Council District Transportation Management Assn. was 
recognized by the 900-member Southern California chapter of the Assn. for 
Commuter Transportation as the organization with the most outstanding work in 
the region educating commuters about alternatives to driving alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very pleasantly surprised," said Aaron Hanson, executive director of 
TMA. "It's like recognition from your peers that you have done a really good 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chatsworth association, which represents more than 15,000 employees at 25 
West Valley companies, offers educational seminars and trip-reduction planning 
with the goal of improving air quality through increased ride-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it began in 1991, the Chatsworth organization has persuaded an average 
of 39 people from each of its companies to ride-share. The majority of the 
funding for the organization comes from membership fees. It has also won grants 
to provide services such as shuttles to connect commuter rail stations to 
businesses. SUSAN BYRNES

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; BOARD APPROVES PLAN TO SELL GILL SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westminster School District board has approved a plan to sell the closed 
Gill School to residential developers for as much as $6.1 million, giving the 
district a cash infusion that will allow it to make improvements at other area 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted unanimously on Thursday to sell the site, at 15252 Victoria 
Lane in Huntington Beach, to the Newport Beach-based development firm of 
Kaufman & Broad, which plans to build several dozen homes on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale is expected to bring in between $5.3 million and $6.1 million, 
depending on the number of homes the city approves to be built on the land, 
district spokeswoman Audrey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best possible deal we could have hoped for. We've had a mile-long 
list of school facilities improvements we'll now be able to make with the 
money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those improvements include purchasing portable classrooms for Frank N. 
Eastwood Elementary School, adding sprinklers to some athletic fields, repaving 
parking lots and playgrounds, and fixing roofs at campuses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill School was closed in 1976. The board voted last year to sell the site, as 
well as the Midway City Elementary School, as excess property. At the time, the 
sale of both properties was expected to bring in a total of about $6 million, 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, last September the board sold Midway City for $3.5 million, bringing 
the expected income from both sites to about $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gill was designated as excess property last year, residents urged the 
board to reject any development plan that would include high-density housing in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the trustees emphasized that the board took those concerns into 
consideration in approving the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman & Broad plans to build about 55 detached single-family homes on the 
10-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Ron Morgan said: "This will blend in well in the neighborhood, and it 
will have a positive impact. We're very pleased and excited about the project 
going in there." JON NALICK

 In City Clerk Verna L. Rollinger's office, 15-year-old Emily Moore assembled 
an agenda packet for Tuesday's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to see how real people spend their lives," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, set up by Laguna Beach High School, also allowed five students to 
act as "student City Council members" alongside elected officials Tuesday 
night. The program is an observance of National Leadership Week. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Student Day In Government program, teen-agers were matched with role 
models in an exercise that allowed them to show their leadership skills and see 
how complex issues are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach High School activities director Dawn Mirone said she began 
looking for mentors for the students several weeks ago. About 40 local agencies 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep getting calls from business owners," she said earlier this week. "The 
idea has really caught fire. . . . I have one orthodontist who rescheduled all 
his appointments on Friday so they'd be real interesting things for the kids to 
see, including tooth extractions." 
</P>
<P>
 Students and mentors began Friday at a breakfast meeting at the Hotel Laguna, 
then headed off to their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been fascinated with helping people," sophomore Shawn McDonald 
said as he sat in Fire Chief Richard Dewberry's office. "I want to do something 
exciting when I grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 But one lesson the teen-agers learned as they "shadowed" their mentors was 
that jobs which appear glamorous from a distance may be less exhilarating up 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 After sticking close to police investigator Jim White for an hour or so, 
Lawrence Bammer, 15, found that filing and typing take up much of White's day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems with investigations there's a lot of paperwork," Bammer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city's Planning Department, Nicole Osmanski, 15 observed a request for 
an outdoor display permit, and seemed surprised by the invisible bureaucracy 
that city workers -- and residents -- wrestle with daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really amazing what goes into it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For White's shadows, Bammer and Bulfrano Hernandez, the action picked up 
slightly when the teen-agers accompanied White as he asked a local businessman 
to identify a suspected thief from a photo lineup. When he couldn't, the 
disappointed investigator and the two students headed back to the Police 
Department in an unmarked car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping he'd pick him out and you guys could see a detective get 
excited," White said. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; LAID-OFF EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE FOR TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 300 Anaheim workers laid off from two prominent defense industry 
employers are eligible for a $1-million federally funded job-training program 
run by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers let go from Rockwell in Anaheim and Lucas Western-ATD can obtain 
services including job search assistance, basic education, occupational 
classroom training, on-the-job training and supportive services such as 
transportation and child-care assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Lucas Western is in the City of Industry, it is still eligible for 
the program since it employed a substantial number of Anaheim residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants are intended to help workers who were victims of extensive cutbacks 
in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The training program officially started in February and will last until Aug. 
31, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to get people retrained and back into the work force," said Ruben 
Aseves, head of planning and contracts for Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 3 to 0 earlier this week to approve an agreement with 
the state to start the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal funding rules, Anaheim had to apply for the funds through the 
state Employment Development Department.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; MAN ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood man stabbed his friend to death Friday morning after the two 
had an argument in the suspect's apartment while his wife and three small 
children slept in another room, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Garcia, 24, was arrested about four hours after the attack at a nearby 
convenience store, said LAPD Detective Mike Coffey.During the morning, Garcia 
phoned his apartment and talked to police several times before he told them 
where he was, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 6:30 a.m. at the Kona Isle Apartments, 5650 N. Fair 
Ave., when Garcia began arguing with his friend, Roque Villalobos, 25. 
</P>
<P>
 While investigators do not know why the men were fighting, the argument 
apparently escalated, and Garcia stabbed Villalobos several times in the chest 
with a knife, Coffey said. Villalobos died at the scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, detectives said, Garcia ran from the house but later turned himself 
in at a convenience store at Oxnard Street and Laurel Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ardy Bojko, the apartment manager, said Garcia is married and has three small 
children, including a baby about 3 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, residents of the building described Garcia as a good 
neighbor. "He was always working on his car and asking people if they needed 
help on their cars," said Dolores King, who lives two doors down. "He was 
friendly, but not overly so." TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CLASS LANGUAGE SHIFT UPSETS LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a special committee mulls over how Spanish-speaking students should be 
taught at McKinley Elementary School, parents are still asking why they were 
not included in a decision earlier this year to teach non-English classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to know why we were excluded," said Lila Ramirez, a member of the 
Burbank Human Relations Council and spokeswoman for McKinley's Latino parents, 
at a Burbank School Board meeting Thursday night. "And what you are going to do 
about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Latino parents say they were not given a chance to voice their opinions when 
some classes for Spanish-speaking students at McKinley were changed in February 
from bilingual to Spanish-only. 
</P>
<P>
 The move prompted protests from parents, who complained that their children 
were being segregated. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we needed to do is try to help the Spanish parents understand that this 
is not segregation," said Andrea Canady, director of curriculum instruction and 
bilingual education. Teaching some classes in Spanish only helps students learn 
more effectively and allows the teacher to focus on lessons, rather than having 
to split classes between English and Spanish instruction, Canady said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing is being done all over the state," said Canady, adding that 
similar programs have been started at Joaquin Miller, George Washington and 
Providencia elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes at McKinley were made with little -- if any -- parental input, 
district officials admitted. But they said a special committee, which is 
chaired by Supt. Arthur Pierce and includes McKinley parent representatives, 
has been created since then to study bilingual programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't turn back and rectify what has already happened," Pierce said. 
"What you can do is get on with the rest of your lives in a way that gains a 
better understanding between parents and staff." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has been meeting weekly for about a month, gathering information 
on other bilingual education programs and visiting classrooms and other school 
sites. Eventually, the committee will make a recommendation to the school board 
through Pierce as to what, if any, changes should be made in bilingual 
instruction at McKinley. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has no timetable, but probably will make a recommendation in 
time for the new school year in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are asking the board to establish equity for all people," Ramirez said. 
"I'll accept the professional opinion. But I want them to explain it to me 
before they make any changes." ED BOND

<P>
 A fire broke out in a Glendale apartment complex early Friday, the second 
arson fire in the neighborhood in less than a week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one resident suffered smoke inhalation, and the complex at 1019 E. 
Glenoaks Blvd. was briefly evacuated, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out about 2 a.m. near one of the building's elevators, said 
Sgt. Mel Barnes of the Glendale Police Department. After the blaze was 
extinguished, investigators found a flammable liquid in one of the complex's 
elevators. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's three elevator shafts were destroyed in the fire, Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 No damage estimates were available. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 19, an arson fire gutted a nearby apartment complex but caused no 
serious injuries, Barnes said. There have been no arrests in either incident, 
he said. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; POLICE PREPARE TEEN PARTY WARNING LETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Dear Parents: Your son/daughter hosted a party at your home where there was 
some evidence that alcohol was served. We want you to be aware of possible 
criminal and civil liabilities should someone at your home cause injury or 
death to someone as a result of intoxication."  
</P>
<P>
 So begins a letter police will soon be sending to parents of juveniles hosting 
parties where alcohol is thought to have been served. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, which will be signed by Police Chief Manuel E. Ortega, is one 
element of a tougher policy to enforce underage drinking laws approved this 
week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of parties involving underage drinking and drug use has been 
increasing "at a disturbing rate," Ortega said. "There is (currently) no clear 
policy by law enforcement to break up such parties and inform parents." 
</P>
<P>
 While police say they have not kept track of the number of complaints 
specifically involving alcohol parties and minors, they have noticed more 
underage drinking at parties, both in the city and countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Police spokeswoman Corrine Loomis said parents who allow their children to 
serve alcohol to underage friends can be charged with furnishing alcohol to a 
minor, a misdemeanor that could result in a fine, a jail term of not more than 
a year, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy requires police to confiscate or destroy alcohol found at 
underage parties and to notify parents of both party-givers and guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also passed a resolution calling for parents and community help in 
preventing alcohol-related parties, noting that many adults consider it 
acceptable to provide alcohol minors. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution reminds local merchants to check the identification from all 
persons purchasing alcohol. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHEAST VALLEY; WACHS SAYS CITY PAYS UNNECESSARY TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his latest charge of waste in City Hall, Los Angeles Councilman Joel Wachs 
said Friday that the city pays millions of dollars annually in sales taxes on 
shipping costs of supplies and equipment that it is not obligated to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference, Wachs said the city is excluded from paying sales taxes 
on shipping costs but pays it nonetheless because vendors who sell supplies to 
the city do not itemize the shipping costs on bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs, who represents the northeast area of the San Fernando Valley, 
introduced a motion Friday asking that the city's purchasing procedures be 
amended to require vendors to list shipping charges separately. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city purchases about $700 million worth of supplies and equipment 
annually. If all the purchases were to include shipping charges that were 
taxed, that would amount to $7.5 million, Wachs said. But he acknowledged that 
most of the purchases do not include shipping charges and the overpayment is 
closer to $2 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs, who recently took over leadership of the council's Governmental 
Efficiency Committee, criticized the city last week for making bulk purchases 
of supplies and materials that he said could be bought much cheaper at retail 
stores. HUGO MARTIN

 City officials have unveiled designs for the long-awaited federal courthouse 
project, a 10-story, $123-million building planned for completion by spring, 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 During a slide presentation at this week's City Council meeting, architect R. 
Doss Mabe offered a preview of the Ronald Reagan Federal Building and U.S. 
Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Slides showed a white building surrounded by palm trees and decorated with 
marble. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtrooms will have 18-foot-high vaulted ceilings and state-of-the-art 
security systems. Special features will include an exterior promenade and a 
large atrium with a mural depicting Santa Ana history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't be more excited about the project. It's been a long time in 
coming, and we're really looking forward to it," said Mayor Daniel H. Young. 
</P>
<P>
 The 214-foot building will be the tallest building in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 The 500,000-square-foot project will include courtrooms and support space as 
well as a three-level subterranean parking garage, said Downtown Development 
Manager Roger Kooi. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the prestigious project would also stimulate business downtown 
by attracting more people to the area.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; NEW MAYOR CALLS FOR COUNCIL TEAMWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli has urged his colleagues on the City Council to 
work together as a team to ensure the city's continued progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his election Tuesday to the one-year term as mayor, Saltarelli said 
the city faces a serious challenge because the state is again poised to take 
away property taxes from cities and special districts to balance its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities and special district could pay a horrible price," Saltarelli said, 
adding that preliminary estimates indicate that the state could have a 
$6-billion shortfall for the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said city officials should adopt a conservative 1994-95 city budget and 
"aggressively move forward with redevelopment in the next two years." 
</P>
<P>
 "We must do it together," Saltarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the council's first session since the April 12 municipal election, Jim 
Potts was chosen mayor pro tempore. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 4 to 1. Councilman Jeffery Thomas voted against Potts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was in line for the mayor pro tempore job under the traditional 
rotation of the mayor and mayor pro tempore positions, which are largely 
ceremonial. Potts was the out-going mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas said that he will be a team player on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Mary E. Wynn swore in Tracy Worley and Michael J. Doyle, who beat 
incumbents Charles E. Puckett and Leslie Anne Pontious in the April 12 
election, as the newest council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley and Doyle will serve for four years.BERT ELJERA

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP SUES TO BLOCK HOAG PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An environmental group has filed a lawsuit against the California Coastal 
Commission in an effort to reverse the panel's approval in February of an 
expansion plan by Hoag Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contends that the commission should not have approved the 20-acre 
hospital development because the project is not consistent with the terms of 
the California Coastal Act, which was designed to protect and preserve 
wetlands. The development would result in the loss of about two acres of 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed Monday in San Francisco Superior Court. Both the Coastal 
Commission and the plaintiff, the League for Coastal Protection, are based in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit comes two months after the commission voted 11 to 0 to allow the 
construction of various medical buildings and an outpatient center on the 
vacant land, nestled in a coastal bluff area below the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the project, the commission set aside a report from its staff 
that recommended the project be rejected mainly because it would result in the 
loss of wetlands without offering sufficient mitigating action. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the plan approved by the commission, Hoag Hospital did agree to pay 
for certain enhancements at a wetlands near UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Vandersloot, a Newport Beach resident and member of the League for Coastal 
Protection, said Friday that the commission should have followed its staff's 
recommendation and denied the hospital's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandersloot said the wetlands, known as Cat-Tail Cove, are home to more than 
50 species of animals and birds and to coastal sage scrub.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Coastal Commission could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Broussard, a spokeswoman for Hoag Hospital, said that she is confident 
that the project will be built as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to wait and see what the legal system does," Broussard said. "We 
have all the (necessary) approvals. We feel confident about the approval the 
commission gave us."

JURORS ACQUIT MAN IN STOLEN RUBY PLOT; COURTS: THEY DEADLOCK ON SIMILAR CHARGES 
INVOLVING A CHATSWORTH RESIDENT. PROSECUTORS MAY SEEK TO RETRY HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys Superior Court jury Friday decided that an Irvine man was not 
involved in a scheme to sell a stolen ruby to its original owner. The panel 
deadlocked, however, over similar charges against a Chatsworth man. 
</P>
<P>
 Behzad Saba, 33, was acquitted by the six-man, six-woman jury of a charge of 
receiving stolen property. Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz declared a mistrial in the 
case against Rasekh Uddin Siddiqui, 46, when the jury reported that it was 
deadlocked 8 to 4 in favor of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors will announce May 6 whether Siddiqui will be retried. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the same jury found Ali Reza Paravar, 42, of Woodland Hills 
guilty of stealing the 6.76-carat Burmese ruby -- estimated to be worth between 
$500,000 and $1 million. Paravar faces up to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges against a fourth man arrested in the case -- Antranik Harbouian, 46, 
of Montebello -- were dismissed last week by Stoltz, who ruled that there was 
insufficient evidence presented against him during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Eduards Abele said Saba's acquittal was not unexpected, 
admitting that the evidence against him was weak. But Abele said Paravar's 
conviction was important because this case was not simply a business deal gone 
bad, as defense attorneys had argued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Using the notion of something being a bad business deal is not going to be 
justification for criminal activity," he said. "It may be necessary in the 
jewelry business to be loose about paperwork. But it is not going to justify 
someone flat-out stealing someone else's property." 
</P>
<P>
 The convoluted case came to light over the summer when nearly two dozen law 
enforcement officers, backed up by a police helicopter, arrested the four men 
in an Encino parking lot following a sting operation. The original owner of the 
ruby had agreed to meet the defendants to buy back the gem for $360,000. Police 
found the stone in Paravar's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, German gem trader Peter Morlock gave the ruby in 1990 
to Ron Levi to sell on consignment. Levi was to either return it within two 
days or pay Morlock $527,000. Instead, Levi gave the stone to Paravar. 
</P>
<P>
 Paravar testified that he refused to return the ruby to Morlock because Levi 
owed him $300,000 and had given him the gem as collateral. Morlock then went to 
police. As the police investigation began, Levi disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 He has not been charged in the case, but has been indicted by a grand jury in 
Texas in another alleged gem consignment scam.

MAN CONVICTED OF DEFRAUDING 100 VICTIMS OUT OF $3 MILLION; CRIME: OFFICIALS SAY 
SELF-STYLED FRANCHISE EXPERT DON DAVID WILSON PROMISED INVESTORS BRAND-NAME 
ITEMS BUT SENT WORTHLESS GOODS. HE TARGETED THE ELDERLY, THEY SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A self-styled franchise expert from the San Fernando Valley was convicted 
Friday of defrauding more than 100 victims out of $3 million they sent him to 
set up their "impulse product" businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Don David Wilson and his Sherman Oaks and Encino companies 
especially targeted the elderly, telling them they could augment their 
retirement income by setting up display racks in stores with heavy foot 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of getting brand-name items such as hosiery, batteries and disposable 
razors as promised, the victims -- many of whom paid Wilson's companies more 
than $30,000 apiece -- received worthless items that few stores would even let 
them display, such as cheap pen and pencil sets, kiddie jewelry, self-help 
tapes and solar barbecues, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Diane Hawkes 
Birnholz. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in charge of a very devious scheme," said Birnholz, a prosecutor with 
the Justice Department's Major Frauds Section. "He used his franchise expertise 
to scam victims across the country. They ended up getting mostly cheap plastic 
buckets filled with pens." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have identified more than 100 victims. Birnholz said Wilson and 
his companies "targeted victims from as far away from California as they 
could," so the people could not track them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who was indicted in December, 1992, was a fugitive for a month, until 
he was stopped for speeding in Texas. When his Jeep was searched, authorities 
found brochures of vacation spots in Mexico and a map showing a highlighted 
route from Texas to Guadalajara, Birnholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had reason to believe he planned to flee to Mexico," she said, although he 
was not heading south at the time of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other people, alleged associates of Wilson, will be tried in a case 
scheduled to begin June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing testimony during 3 1/2 weeks of trial, the jury deliberated for 
one day before convicting Wilson. He faces a maximum 60 years in prison and 
$2.5 million in fines, Birnholz said. She said authorities are now trying to 
locate his assets and those of his companies so victims can be repaid. Among 
the companies Wilson set up were Great American Service Merchandising Corp. and 
P.O.P. American Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point I don't have any information about his ability to pay 
restitution," Birnholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was convicted of eight counts of mail fraud and two counts of 
interstate transportation of money obtained by fraud. The case also was 
investigated by the Federal Trade Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and 
the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Wilson printed up slick brochures and took to the radio and 
TV airwaves to solicit investors, offering them a franchise for an initial 
investment of $28,480 plus additional money over time for the products. 
Prosecutors said Wilson used numerous aliases, and created an elaborate system 
of phony franchises around the country to create the illusion of a nationwide 
network of successful businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They created a network of false franchisees to give glowing reports of their 
success," said Birnholz. "But the stories were all false." 
</P>
<P>
 Those products that the buyers did get, including the pen and pencil sets, 
were of poor quality. Others, such as solar barbecues priced at $29.95 each, 
"did not do very well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheme was in operation from 1982 to 1988, authorities said. Wilson and 
other alleged conspirators promised to train clients in the operation of a 
franchise business, and promised each of them as many as 10 consignment 
locations with high foot traffic, such as liquor stores, supermarkets and 
mini-marts. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the franchise buyers found that the only merchants who had agreed 
to display their products for a share of the profits were "tiny, dirty shops" 
that few customers frequented, Birnholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also alleged that when enough franchisees began complaining about 
Wilson and authorities began investigating, he and his associates would shut 
down and begin anew, under a new name, in a different location using new 
aliases.

LAWYER'S DONATION TO HELP QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to reach out to San Fernando Valley students affected by the 
Northridge earthquake, a Claremont attorney has donated $50,000 in scholarships 
to help first-time community college students at Valley College in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the earthquake, I figured those kids probably need a lot of help," 
said attorney Herbert Hafif, who donated the scholarships. "Some of them, 
they've lost their houses. They've been through a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The donation to the college is part of a four-way split of $200,000 in 
scholarships Hafif donated this week to community colleges. The other colleges 
receiving a Hafif donation of $50,000 are Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, 
Chaffey College in Alta Loma and Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds will be divided into 25 scholarships of $1,000 for each community 
college for two years and will be available to students beginning with the fall 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials will determine at a later date the criteria for the 
scholarships, but Hafif hinted that it will be based in part on those who have 
suffered personal hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 Hafif said he wanted to grant the money to community college students because 
he feels they have been overlooked by scholarship donors. He also said he could 
relate to their experience and serve as a role model, not just "some guy who 
wants his name on a building." 
</P>
<P>
 After serving as a paratrooper, Hafif could not afford to attend a private 
college. So, he enrolled at Chaffey College, where he went on to earn 
scholarships that eventually led to a degree from USC School of Law in 1956. He 
now runs his own law firm with 13 attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe if they see there was a guy who lived in a $35-a-month 
apartment," Hafif said, "who suffered along with them in wondering if I was 
ever going to finish school or not, maybe when they pass through it themselves, 
they'll pass along the favor."

TEMPORARY WORKERS TO BE HIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles is in the process of hiring 1,150 temporary workers 
through a federal grant to help the city and its residents recover more quickly 
from the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The $11.4-million grant from the federal Department of Labor was formally 
accepted Friday by the Los Angeles City Council.But by then, the city had 
already hired the first 500 or so of the workers for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Kate Kim, a personnel analyst, said most of the workers will work directly for 
the city, paving streets damaged by the quake, erecting signs for street 
detours and repairing damaged park facilities, among other assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the workers will be assigned to nonprofit organizations such as 
the Red Cross to help with displaced quake victims, she said, while others 
might work for the Los Angeles Unified School District repairing school 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the job classifications are simply for "special program 
assistants," some of the classifications include painters, carpenters, 
plasterers, electricians and plumbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobs are only for six months and are being offered primarily to people who 
lost their homes or jobs to the quake. People who have been without work for at 
least 15 weeks will also be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Employment Development Department is screening potential workers, 
Kim said.

SERIES TO DISCUSS REBUILDING SCHOOLS; BURBANK: THE TOWN HALL MEETINGS WILL BE 
HELD TO SOLICIT IDEAS FROM THE PUBLIC. THEY FOLLOW A BALLOT MEASURE'S DEFEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to regroup after the defeat of last week's $100-million ballot measure 
to rebuild the schools, the Burbank Board of Education announced a series of 
town hall meetings to solicit the public's ideas on how to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of it as a real brainstorming session," board President Elena Hubbell 
said at Thursday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The first town hall meeting will be held at 10 a.m. May 14 at John Burroughs 
High School. The board wants to include a variety of people in the meetings, 
including those who opposed the bond referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 More town hall meetings may follow. Board members hope the meetings will lead 
to focus groups and community involvement, so that a widely supported way of 
rebuilding the schools could be found. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond measure, part of a $138-million plan to rebuild the district's aging 
schools, received 53% of the vote but needed two-thirds majority to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 However, board members said public support for rebuilding the schools -- some 
of which date to the 1920s -- is high, adding that they want to take advantage 
quickly before the support dissipates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten a lot of calls to my home in the past few days," said board 
member Joseph Hooven. "There's a real sense that something needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The board has a range of options, including placing another bond measure on 
the November ballot or starting a piecemeal reconstruction of public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The $138-million plan included $15 million in state modernization funds and 
$23 million in Burbank redevelopment money. The school board and the City 
Council worked closely on the bond referendum in a relationship that school 
board members want to rekindle. 
</P>
<P>
 The $23 million in city aid was offered as part of a larger financing plan and 
was contingent on the bond passing. However, board member Robert Dunivant 
suggested Thursday night that the school district request $16.5 million from 
the city that might be used with state funds to modernize and upgrade the 
elementary and middle schools by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the $100 million raised by the bond issue would have gone to a 
complete reconstruction and redesign of Burbank High School, as well as for 
major renovations of John Burroughs High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunivant suggested that perhaps later there might be more support for 
combining the two high schools on one site, which the school district could 
more easily afford. But that idea has been vigorously resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Denise Lioy Wilcox said she hoped that with the town hall 
meetings, the focus groups and the committees, the school district will know 
what direction it is headed by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ted McConkey, a vocal opponent of the bond measure, told the board that he 
hoped the town hall meetings would not lead to another bond election. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board wants to place another bond measure on the November ballot, it 
will have to act by the first week of July, district Supt. Arthur Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My belief is that a bond issue is the only way to do it," Pierce said. "The 
question is how much and when."

WAYNE AMBROSE, LONGTIME COACH AND RUNNER, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wayne Aubrey Ambrose, a longtime football and track coach who lived in Orange 
County for half a century, died of cancer Friday. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambrose, who taught physical education and coached for more than three decades 
at high schools in the Garden Grove Unified School District, was himself an 
accomplished runner. He won several events racing around the world, according 
to his wife, Arlane. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Oak Grove, Ark., Ambrose attended Rancho Santiago College and lived 
with his family in Santa Ana for many years. He was the youth minister at 
Garden Grove's Church of the Nazarene and routinely taught Sunday school to 
crowds of 100 or more.

BROWN LAUNCHES SMALL-BUSINESS LOAN PROGRAM; POLITICS: THE STATE TREASURER AND 
CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR SAYS THE ACTION HELPS FULFILL HER PLEDGE TO CREATE JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kathleen Brown put on two hats Friday, as the state's treasurer and as a 
Democratic candidate for governor, to start a government program for small 
businesses that helps fulfill her campaign pledge to create 1 million new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the California Capital Access Program is partly to help fledgling 
companies by making small-business loans easier to obtain. Brown launched the 
program Friday at a booming 2-year-old manufacturing company that was having 
cash-flow problems and was being courted by other states for relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am on a mission to create 1 million new jobs," Brown said in the warehouse 
of Timberline Gas Logs Co., maker of simulated logs for gas fireplaces. "By 
providing access to affordable loans, Cal-CAP will help many small businesses 
like Timberline get the dollars needed to expand, invest in research and 
equipment and hire workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's appearance was actually a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a program that 
she already announced in a January news conference and was unveiled in 
legislation signed in October by her Republican rival, Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of Friday's event was to recognize the award of the first 
Cal-CAP assisted loan to Timberline -- for $500,000 -- and for Brown to 
underscore her pledge to create 1 million California jobs by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobs pledge was part of a new focus that Brown's campaign introduced at 
last weekend's state Democratic convention, along with a new team of 
strategists and staff. Since the announcement, however, the idea has been 
sharply criticized as a campaign gimmick by Wilson and by the other Democratic 
candidates -- state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom 
Hayden (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's opponents noted that economists have already predicted that the 
state's economy should create 1 million jobs over the next four years no matter 
who is governor. Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting 
Project, said Friday that his department's most recent study actually calls for 
1.2 million new jobs in California by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown responded to her critics Friday: "If you look back, the economic 
forecasts in 1990, 1991 said there would be 170,000 jobs created. California, 
in fact, lost double that number. So economists make forecasts just like 
weathermen -- weather people -- make forecasts." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, spokesman for the governor, and Elena Stern, spokeswoman for 
Garamendi's campaign, ridiculed the idea that Brown could get credit for the 1 
million jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 "Her campaign slogan might as well be, 'Vote for me and I will stay out of the 
way,' " Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Timberline on Friday, President Jeff Straubel said the loan provided by the 
Cal-CAP program will help the company add about 30 employees to its 100-member 
work force. He described the payment as a godsend. "It is going to allow us to 
ship our products on time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Cal-CAP program, a loan is provided by a bank but partially insured 
by money from a state reserve fund. The reserve fund includes state money 
acquired through corporate fees as well as contributions from the borrower and 
the lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael K. Gallagher, a Wells Fargo Bank officer at the news conference 
Friday, said Timberline did not qualify under the bank's usual lending 
standards because it is too young. With Cal-CAP assistance, however, Gallagher 
said the bank's lending standards could be been lowered, thus allowing the 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of public-private partnerships we can develop to restore the 
California promise of good, decent-paying jobs," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation was initiated last year by the California Bankers Assn., based 
on similar models operating in four other states. Brown campaign officials said 
the candidate played a major role in support for the legislation and that her 
office oversees the state spending to operate the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the state has provided an initial $1 million for the program, which 
is expected to leverage about $20 million in private investment. She said more 
money will be made available for the project if there is a demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Brostrom, an aide in the treasurer's office, said a similar program has 
been operating since 1986 in Michigan, where 2,700 loans have provided a total 
of $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, five banks have agreed to participate in the California program. Brown 
urged businesses seeking loans through Cal-CAP to apply through a participating 
bank.

GSA CHIEF TO PAY GOVERNMENT FOR PERSONAL EXPENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roger W. Johnson, the head of the General Services Administration, plans to 
repay the government $256.73 for 184 long-distance phone calls and several 
pieces of overnight mail that his staff said amounted to personal use of 
government resources, it was announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, the Orange County businessman who rose to become the highest-ranking 
Republican in the Clinton Administration, ordered the review by GSA's Chief 
Financial Officer Dennis J. Fischer after questions arose about his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier examination of travel reimbursements, Fischer determined that 
Johnson had violated no regulations, but the GSA chief opted to repay about 
$800 anyway, his staff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, former chief executive officer of Western Digital Corp. in Irvine, 
was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But GSA spokesman Hap Conners called the scrutiny of the expense reports an 
effort by critics to discredit Johnson as he works to restructure the 
$60-billion agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people in town who are quite comfortable with the way things 
are and look at change as a threat," Conners said. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate probe by the GSA's inspector general -- also requested by Johnson 
-- is pending.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BIRDS TAKE UP RESIDENCE AT CAR DEALERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Valencia car dealership has become a temporary bird sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia Jeep Eagle showroom was rattled by the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake and sustained minor damage that included the loosening of a 
2-foot-by-2-foot light attached to a stucco overhang. 
</P>
<P>
 When officials attempted to secure the light, now sitting at a prominent angle 
with its interior wires visible, they noticed a pair of hand-sized birds 
building a nest. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted John Wilson, who handles sales and leasing for the dealership, 
to ask his bosses to leave the birds undisturbed. The bosses agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked like they were cute and it looked like they were building for a 
nice, warm family," said Matt Ghuman, sales manager. "We didn't want to destroy 
somebody's home, even if they were in the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
 The two brown sparrows, distinctive because of their color and a white slash 
on each wing, have already been named by Wilson -- "Jawbone" for the male after 
Wilson's music company and "Tracey" for the female, for "someone I love very 
much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, their makeshift nest sits above a pair of $20,000 Chrysler LeBaron 
convertibles. The damaged light is considered secure -- even at its tilted 
angle.  
</P>
<P>
 And aside from prompting some extra cleanings of the cars' hoods, the birds 
have been unobtrusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're pretty smart. When the light comes on at night, they're 
warm," said Wilson. "They've moved from trees to condos." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless disrupted, the birds are expected to stay in their new home for two 
months, laying eggs in three to four weeks and then spending another four weeks 
as the baby birds learn to fly.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LAW FIRM SEEKS $367,000 FROM CITY AFTER 
FUNDING BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles law firm that blocked Lancaster's plan to use redevelopment 
housing funds to pay for two bridges over railroad tracks is trying to collect 
$367,000 in legal fees from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the request, scheduled Friday in San Fernando Superior Court, was 
postponed until May 27 and moved to Burbank Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are contesting the fee request, arguing that the law firm of 
Kane, Ballmer & Berkman deserves no more than $50,000 to cover its expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that's what the reasonable amount is for this case, based on what 
they spent," said David R. McEwen, Lancaster's city attorney. "We think their 
billing rates are too high, clearly higher than what they charge their public 
law clients." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute stems from a two-year court battle over Lancaster's plan to use 
redevelopment dollars reserved for housing projects to pay for overpasses at 
Avenue L and Avenue H. The bridges were designed to carry cars over busy Sierra 
Highway and the adjacent railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders argued that the bridges would open the city's eastside to new 
home construction, including dwellings for people with low and moderate 
incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Los Angeles law firm, representing Lancaster resident Dolores Dibley, 
asserted that it was a misuse of redevelopment money. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the city in 1992, but the 2nd 
District Court of Appeal overturned that decision last year. In February, the 
California Supreme Court refused to consider the case, allowing the appellate 
court's decision to stand. 
</P>
<P>
 When the court battle began, Lancaster officials decided to use other funds to 
pay for the two bridges. The $12.4-million Avenue L overpass opened last month, 
and construction of the Avenue H overpass is expected to begin later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the change in financing, the city continued to defend its original 
plan in court, and attorneys for Kane, Ballmer & Berkman say the city's 
Redevelopment Agency should cover their expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they say state law allows them to receive additional compensation 
for setting a precedent that could prevent other agencies from misusing 
redevelopment funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do think this is an important case," said Kathryn Reinmann, an attorney 
with the firm. "It's the first time in California that someone has ruled on the 
use of housing trust funds. It's going to give guidance for cities."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TRANSIT AUTHORITY TO OFFER FREE RIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There may be no such thing as a free lunch, but for Antelope Valley commuters 
there are free rides. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to boost ridership on three commuter lines added in the wake of 
the Northridge earthquake, the Antelope Valley Transit Authority is offering 
free rides on those routes next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The free rides are being offered Monday to Friday on the Van Nuys, Los Angeles 
International Airport area and Century City/West Los Angeles lines. The free 
rides do not apply to the transit agency's San Fernando Valley and downtown Los 
Angeles commuter lines. 
</P>
<P>
 All three of the post-quake routes, which cost more than $400,000 a month, are 
being funded primarily by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which will 
pay 90% of the net cost of the service, said Tim Galbraith, AVTA grants 
manager. The state will pay three-fourths of the balance, leaving the transit 
agency with only a small tab. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter service to Van Nuys was initiated April 4. Service to the LAX area 
began April 11, and service to Century City and West Los Angeles began April 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridership has been low. The Van Nuys line has been used the most, with about a 
dozen daily riders. The LAX line has had only about five daily riders, 
Galbraith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brand new service is always like this," he said. "This is all brand new so 
any promotion we can do early on in the service helps build a core ridership." 
</P>
<P>
 Government funding for the three lines is expected to continue until the 
interchange of the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways, damaged by the 
Jan. 17 quake, is repaired, Galbraith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the government funding dries up, the routes will be continued only if 
ridership is high enough to cover the cost of services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly passes for the Van Nuys line are $115, while the monthly fare on the 
LAX and Century City lines is $130.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 200 VOICE OPPOSITION TO ELSMERE CANYON DUMP; 
ENVIRONMENT: MEETING IS MIXTURE OF OLD FEARS ABOUT LANDFILL AND NEW CONCERNS 
PROMPTED BY JAN. 17 QUAKE. 
</P>

<P>
 A man in a bear suit, community activists, environmentalists, elected 
officials and actress Linda Gray delivered a message to county and federal 
officials: They don't want a dump in nearby Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 Santa Clarita residents packed the Ranch House Inn conference 
room Thursday to voice their opposition to the proposed dump. The canyon is 
outside the Santa Clarita city limits, southeast of where San Fernando Road 
intersects the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thought of destroying so precious and unique a resource for a repository 
for human trash is unthinkable," said Alan Kishbaugh, president of the 
Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we allow so poor a use of the land as this, we may well deserve the 
disastrous environmental consequences to our health and well-being that an 
action will surely bring." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-hour meeting was sponsored by the Los Angeles County Regional 
Planning Department and included a representative of the U. S. Forest Service. 
It wasn't part of the official public hearing process for the environmental 
impact report being prepared on the dump proposal, but county regional planner 
Richard Frazier said new information from the meeting will be included in the 
document. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, the meeting was a mixture of old fears about the landfill and new 
concerns prompted by the Northridge earthquake and its rattling of the Santa 
Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can retrofit buildings, you can retrofit freeways, but you can't retrofit 
a landfill," Santa Clarita Councilwoman Jan Heidt warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only You Can Prevent Forest Dumps," read the sign carried by the bear, who 
never spoke but pumped his arms and waved enthusiastically in support of other 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents restated concerns that a dump could leak into Santa Clarita's 
underground water supply, which the area relied upon heavily during 
California's drought and in the months since the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, a 20-year Santa Clarita Valley resident, said a dump threatens the 
quality of life that prompted her and others to move to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never used to worry about the water (my children) drink, water they swim 
in," Gray said. "Now I have a grandchild and it is a completely different 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 The draft environmental impact report on Elsmere Canyon has been delayed 
several times and is now projected for release at the end of the year.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TRIAL ORDERED IN POISONING OF ENGLISH TEACHER

<P>
 A Littlerock High School student Friday was ordered to stand trial on charges 
that he poisoned his English teacher by dumping cleaning fluid into her can of 
Diet Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, whose name is being withheld because of his age, is accused of the 
April 7 poisoning of teacher Susan Ennis, 32, who became violently ill after 
she took a gulp of soda that had been laced with cleaning fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 A probation report presented to Commissioner Antoinette Liewen on Friday 
during a hearing at Sylmar Juvenile Court recommended that the youth proceed to 
trial.  
</P>
<P>
 The trial was scheduled to begin May 2. Liewen rejected a request by the boy's 
attorney, Ronald V. Taylor, to release the boy into his parents' custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school sophomore faces a count each of adulterating a beverage and 
assault with a deadly weapon, both felony offenses. If convicted, he could face 
five to eight years in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said Friday that it remains unknown when Ennis, reportedly 
recovering from the incident at home, will return to teach her class. The 
teacher spent several days in a Palmdale hospital after the incident.

QUAKE RELIEF EFFORT CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council, with donations from government 
agencies and church groups around the country, has raised nearly half of its 
$500,000 goal for long-term earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was in a good position to help with emergency relief on Jan. 17 
with all three senior centers and many of its 14 food pantry sites open within 
hours of the 6.8-magnitude shaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to hire extra staff, but we already had existing programs to help 
people so we didn't have to reinvent the wheel," said Kimberly Schuler Hall, 
director of the council's Earthquake Response Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of six staffers hired for the project, including Hall herself, were 
people displaced from their regular employment by the destructive quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, a Mormon who had been an active volunteer with the interfaith council 
for three years, was laid off by a Sherman Oaks department store a few weeks 
after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was quickly hired, at a $2,400-a-month salary, to direct the council's 
relief project, which will last at least until the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
 "If other monies come in, we'll go longer," said Hall, a mother who lives in 
Reseda. Her duties follow naturally on her unpaid work as the Mormon Church's 
regional director for public affairs with responsibility for community and 
interfaith relations in the Valley, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other staff positions for the project were funded through sources other than 
the approximately $235,000 raised to date for the long-range relief project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half of that money came from Project Rebound of the Los Angeles County Mental 
Health Services," Hall said. People age 60 and older are assisted with 
counseling and other needs at the council-run senior centers in Van Nuys, North 
Hollywood and Pacoima, "but we don't turn down anyone else in need," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major gift to the Earthquake Response Project was $50,000 from Pacific 
Telesis, again for work with senior citizens, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest donation was a $5,000 check from Bank of America presented Friday 
at the Interfaith Council office in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 But donations have arrived steadily from other interfaith councils and 
congregations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Church World Service, which gave us $5,000 within days of the earthquake, put 
out a nationwide appeal," Hall said. "Even churches and church councils that 
have been victims of flooding and hurricanes have sent checks." 
</P>
<P>
 The interfaith council has more than 270 affiliated congregations of various 
faiths, but the long-range relief work has been done mainly in cooperation with 
other community service agencies -- religious, secular and government-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall was elected secretary of the new General Unmet Needs Committee, formed in 
the Valley at the request of the American Red Cross, and she is chairwoman of 
the group's specific-case review committee.

PUC TO DISCUSS RATE HIKE PROPOSAL; UTILITIES: EDISON IS SEEKING A 3% INCREASE 
IN REVENUE. BOOST IS OPPOSED BY THE COMMISSION STAFF AND CONSUMER GROUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission will convene in Orange County 
Monday night to consider a rate increase requested by the Southern California 
Edison Co. but opposed by the commission's own staff and consumer advocacy 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 PUC officials said it was too early to tell whether the request would be 
affected by Wednesday's far-reaching decision to eventually allow customers to 
choose their own electricity providers. 
</P>
<P>
 The utilities company has requested a $117-million increase in revenues for 
1995, followed by additional increases of $121 million in 1996 and $111.2 
million in 1997. While the initial increase would represent a 3% revenue boost, 
a spokesman said, additional projected revenues from increased electric sales 
would result in customers seeing only a 1% rate boost -- about 62 cents -- in 
their monthly bills. The average monthly bill for 500 kilowatt hours of power, 
he said, would jump from the current $62.29 to $62.91. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the beginning of the process," Kyle DeVine, a commission spokeswoman, 
said of the public hearing, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in the Council Chambers at 
Laguna Beach City Hall. "We want to hear comments from the public." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company has asked for an increase in service charges -- 
jumping from $5 to $15 for turning electricity on the day after Edison is 
called and from $10 to $25 for same-day service. The company has also requested 
increasing its bad-check charges, from $5 to $10, and hiking its field visit 
charge from $5 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our expenses have increased," explained Alex Miller, the utility company's 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, he said, the proposed increase has been necessitated by four 
factors: inflation, the spiraling cost of providing health care benefits for 
employees, growing conservation expenditures by the company and mounting costs 
associated with the new equipment required to serve a customer base that has 
grown by 37,000 -- about 1% -- over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to spend what it takes to get the job done," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials concede that Edison's rates are already among the highest in 
the country, but attribute that to several factors, including the state's air 
quality restrictions on the use of coal as an inexpensive energy source. They 
also point to the fact that because of the area's temperate climate, customers 
use less electricity, while fixed costs for the utility remain high. 
</P>
<P>
 PUC staffers, however, reject such arguments as exaggerations borne of 
self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe they can do better," said Ramesh Ramchandani, project manager for 
the PUC's Division of Ratepayer Advocates, which analyzes rate increase 
requests for the commission. Based on an analysis of Edison's expenditures in 
several areas, he said, the division concluded that Edison is not doing enough 
to cut its own operating costs. The group, far from backing the proposed 
increase, favors a cut in electric rates of 8.5% (or about $340.6 million) over 
the next three years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it's in Edison's interests to shave costs because this is an era 
of fierce competition," he said, alluding to this week's decision by the PUC to 
break the monopoly of utility companies by allowing residential customers to 
choose from among several major providers beginning in 1996. Smaller industrial 
users would be added in 1998 and small-business customers in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would work to Edison's detriment to further increase rates at a time when 
the economy is in such abysmal condition and competition is on the rise," 
Ramchandani said. "By doing better, Edison would make itself more competitive 
and its services more appealing." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Finkelstein, staff attorney for Toward Utility Rate Normalization (TURN), 
an independent consumer advocacy group, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given Edison's extraordinarily high rates," he said, "asking for more is 
exactly the wrong thing to be doing at this time. We think it's important that 
the commission take this opportunity to cut Edison's costs wherever it can." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Monday's hearing in Laguna Beach, the PUC has scheduled 
hearings over the next month in Long Beach, Culver City, Palm Springs, Palm 
Desert, Ventura, Monrovia, Ontario and Visalia. After receiving input from the 
hearings, DeVine said, the five-member commission will make a decision in 
December. Any rate increase granted, she said, would take effect on Jan. 1, 
1995.

CITY BANS ROLLER-BLADERS FROM TENNIS COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week banned roller-bladers from public tennis courts 
because of complaints from local residents about damage done to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that youths on roller-blades have been removing nets from the 
tennis courts at Rose Drive Elementary School and using the courts to play 
roller hockey, despite "No Roller-Blading" signs posted on the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city began securing the nets with locks, the youths cut them off the 
posts, Brea Police Lt. Jim Winder said. The Brea department patrols Yorba 
Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of tennis players reported to police that they were intimidated by 
the roller-bladers when they tried to use the courts for the intended purpose," 
Winder said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city does not provide any facilities specifically for the growing sport of 
roller-blading, as it does for a number of other recreational activities, 
acknowledged Steve Rudometkin, director of parks and recreation in Yorba Linda. 
But he said tennis courts should nonetheless be off-limits to roller-bladers 
because they destroy the surface of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudometkin said there are no other city facilities that would accommodate 
roller hockey, which is similar to ice hockey. Roller-bladers like to play on 
tennis courts because they are enclosed, eliminating the need to chase down 
hockey pucks. 
</P>
<P>
 As more youths become involved in the sport, several cities and school 
districts around the county have faced similar problems. Mission Viejo, 
Cypress, Fullerton and the Capistrano Unified School District have all evicted 
roller-bladers from various existing park and school facilities.

RAMS NOT LIKELY TO PICK RECEIVER; DRAFT: THEY PLAN TO SELECT QUARTERBACK WITH 
NO. 5 PICK, UNLESS THEY TRADE FOR LOWER-ROUND CHOICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams haven't drafted a wide receiver with their top pick since 1945, when 
the team was preparing to move from Cleveland to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Their selection? 
</P>
<P>
 Elroy (Crazylegs) Hirsch, a future Hall of Famer from Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, they took receiver Aaron Cox with the second of two first-round 
selections in 1988, but the team has not used its top pick on a wideout since 
moving to Los Angeles in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Rams just might stick with tradition when the draft begins Sunday in 
New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 They announced Wednesday they will use the fifth overall pick to take one of 
the top two quarterbacks in the draft -- Fresno State's Trent Dilfer or 
Tennessee's Heath Shuler -- should either be available. Or they could trade the 
pick to Dallas for wide receiver Alvin Harper and a second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Rest assured, the Rams won't be using the fifth pick on a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 John Becker, Ram director of player personnel, doesn't rate a receiver among 
the top 11 college players. He projects Colorado's Charles Johnson the top 
receiver but doesn't justify using the fifth pick to get him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some excellent wide receivers out there," Becker said. "The hottest 
name out there is Johnson. He's fast, extremely competitive and makes big 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
 It's unlikely, but the Rams could trade down for a lower first-round pick and 
take Johnson, USC's Johnnie Morton, Michigan's Derrick Alexander or San Diego 
State's Darnay Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 A trade for Harper would give the Rams Dallas' 46th overall pick, plus their 
original 33rd and 49th overall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are interested in using the 33rd pick on Nebraska safety Toby Wright, 
considered one of the hardest hitters at his position in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 They would likely use one of the other two picks for a promising young 
receiver such as Alabama's David Palmer, Notre Dame's Lake Dawson, Wyoming's 
Ryan Yarborough or Syracuse's Shelby Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Several pro scouts have projected Palmer, a third-year junior who declared 
himself eligible for the draft a year early, as a run-and-shoot-type receiver. 
Many think he would be best suited playing on artificial turf because of his 
quickness and ability to cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams run a conventional offense and play on natural grass, but Palmer's 
superb pass-catching mechanics, plus his big-play threat as a kick and punt 
returner, make him a logical fit in their plans. However, it's unlikely that 
Palmer would be available after the early stages of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palmer has the best hands in this draft, no doubt about it," Becker said. "He 
has the best hands I've seen in my lifetime, and I coached Steve Largent in 
Seattle. The only guy I can think of that has those kind of hands is Largent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The downside is his size (5-7 and 170 pounds) and he's not fast (4.55 in the 
40). So you're looking at a small, quick guy that has great hands and has great 
instincts." 
</P>
<P>
 So why are the Rams left scrambling to find a receiver two months into free 
agency? 
</P>
<P>
 In a perfect world, they would have signed Houston free agent Haywood 
Jeffires. But Jeffires rejected their three-year, $3.9-million offer last week. 
</P>
<P>
 And they barely put up a fight when their all-time leading receiver, Henry 
Ellard, an unrestricted free agent, signed with the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands right now, the Rams' depth chart consists of: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Flipper Anderson, who is on the trading block after struggling last season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Second-year player Sean LaChapelle, who had only two receptions as a 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nate Lewis, a free-agent acquisition from San Diego who's projected as the 
No. 3 receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Todd Kinchen, who's coming off two knee surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Backups Ernie Jones and Richard Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would certainly like to get a receiver in the draft," Coach Chuck Knox 
said. "That's one of our needs." 
</P>
<P>
 * HARPER DIALOGUE CONTINUES 
</P>
<P>
 Executive vice president John Shaw said Rams still are negotiating for Alvin 
Harper. C22 
</P>
<P>
 * CALIFORNIA STATE OF MIND 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Miller wants to play for Rams, but that will depend on who picks Shuler 
and Dilfer. C22

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; BUTCHER EXPECTED TO BE SENT DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Butcher, originally projected to be the Angels' bullpen stopper this 
season, is expected to be demoted this weekend to triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels hoped they could resolve Butcher's problems during this trip, but 
after his outing Thursday night against the Baltimore Orioles, they decided he 
needs to refine his skills in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran John Farrell likely will replace Butcher. Farrell is 1-2 with a 3.15 
earned-run average at Vancouver, striking out 18 in 20 innings. The Angels also 
are considering Russ Springer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do something, probably in the next couple of days," Angel 
Manager Buck Rodgers said. "I hope that was the bottom of the barrel that you 
saw (Thursday). He (Butcher) lost all of his composure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the arm is still there, but it has become increasingly apparent the 
head isn't. I think when he had that little incision (in September), and things 
didn't come back exactly like he wanted, subconsciously he thought he was 
losing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He changed his delivery, and right now his command is bothering him, he's got 
no release point, and he has no idea where he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, who struggled all spring, has a 16.62 ERA and .381 batting average 
this season. Instead of showing any improvement, his ERA is 72.00 in his last 
three outings, allowing 11 baserunners in one inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been my all-time low," said Butcher, who yielded four earned runs in 
two-thirds of an inning Thursday in the Angels' 11-8 victory. "I just want a 
clean slate and start all over. I believe in myself now." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher talked until nearly 4 a.m. with Angel pitching coach Chuck Hernandez 
about his woes, leaving with an abundance of confidence. Yet, Rodgers and 
General Manager Bill Bavasi agreed Friday that for Butcher to regain that 
confidence, he needs to go to Vancouver. BOB NIGHTENGALE

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; LA QUINTA WINS ON NINE UNEARNED RUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM BIRSCHBACH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 La Quinta continues to lead the Garden Grove League baseball standings, but 
Friday's 9-1 victory over Bolsa Grande wasn't quite as easy as Coach Dave 
Demarest would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the Aztecs' runs were unearned, and sophomore pitcher Joe Garcia (5-0) 
got off to a shaky start before four of Bolsa Grande's six errors opened the 
door in the fourth inning for the defending champion Aztecs (17-3, 8-0 in 
league) at Bolsa Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took advantage of their mistakes," Demarest said. "That's the mark of a 
good team." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia walked four and hit a batter in the first two innings, but the Aztecs 
bailed him out with two inning-ending double plays before capitalizing on four 
walks, two errors, three hits and a stolen base for seven runs in the fourth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta scored the first two runs when third baseman Brian Baughman fielded 
Anibal De La Cruz's bunt and threw the ball away at third, where shortstop Alex 
Francisco was covering, allowing Joe Linck and Jim Livernois to score. 
</P>
<P>
 After Garcia's run-scoring fly ball to right field, the Aztecs loaded the 
bases and scored three runs when Bolsa Grande right fielder Kevin Michini 
dropped C.J. Livernois' fly ball. Jim Livernois, who was three for four, drove 
in the final run with a single to left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bolsa's been playing great defense, but when they threw that bunt away, they 
unraveled," Demarest said. "Livernois' hit was the only solid hit of the 
inning." 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta took advantage of two more Bolsa Grande errors to take a 9-0 lead in 
the fifth. Corey Fox scored from first on Joel London's single and a throwing 
error by the right fielder, with London taking third. London scored on an 
errant pickoff attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Grande (8-9, 4-4) scored on Dan Hendrix's double in the fifth. TOM

SUNSET LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; OILERS' DEFENSE PRESERVES VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spectacular defense has not been a characteristic of the Huntington Beach 
baseball team. Neither has consistent defense, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers have continually discovered methods of eluding baseballs, a 
disturbing trend that has led to numerous upset stomachs for Coach Mike Dodd. 
However, they kept a cap on Dodd's antacid tablets Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparked by two key defensive plays in the ninth inning, Huntington Beach 
outlasted host Edison, 5-1, in a key Sunset League game that took 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach (14-5, 5-2 in league play) is tied atop the league standings 
with Fountain Valley. The Oilers did not have an error after committing five in 
a 12-5 loss at Marina on Tuesday. Edison (13-6, 4-4) has lost two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Oiler second baseman Brad Lineberger nailed two runners at the plate in the 
tumultuous ninth. After failing to score since the third inning, Huntington 
Beach scored four runs on three hits in the 11th off of loser Todd Belitz 
(4-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Belitz, the second of three Charger pitchers, struck out 11 in 6 1/3 innings. 
Jim Brewer (6-1), the third of three Oiler pitchers, entered in the ninth and 
picked up the victory. Brewer struck out Belitz with runners on first and 
second to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Lineberger enabled the Oilers to reach that moment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers' Brice Keyser singled to open the ninth inning. Leadoff hitter 
Greg Hanoian then hit a shot down the right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
 Right fielder Jason Segal grabbed the ball and fired a perfect throw to 
Lineberger. Lineberger made an equally great throw to catcher Scott Palmer, who 
applied the tag to a sliding Keyser. 
</P>
<P>
 "That play only works with two perfect throws and that's what we got," Dodd 
said. "I thought Lineberger's throw was great, but so was (Segal's)." 
</P>
<P>
 Lineberger's heroics, however, were not over. 
</P>
<P>
 With another runner on first because of a throwing error by Brewer, Hanoian 
was tagged out by Palmer while retreating to third on a failed squeeze attempt 
with Belitz at bat. But Brewer lost Belitz on a full count, and the Chargers 
were back in business with runners on first and second with two outs after the 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Lineberger. 
</P>
<P>
 He fielded Tom Barilla's grounder to the first base side of second and tried 
to outrace Belitz to second, but Belitz beat him to the bag. With his teammates 
shouting to throw home, Lineberger combined with Palmer to get Travis Clutter 
at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought (Clutter) was in," Charger Coach Paul Harrell said. "I don't want 
it to sound like I'm complaining, but I thought he was there." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 4, Marina 2 -- Miles Hughey hit his first home run of the season in 
the fourth inning for Ocean View (11-8, 4-4). Jason Hoffman added a two-run 
double in the fifth to give the Seahawks the victory. Pat Gildea (2-0) pitched 
a complete game with six strikeouts and three walks. In eight league games, 
Ocean View has turned nine double plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite 9, Santa Ana 3 -- Kevin Krotz stole three bases and had two hits and 
an RBI for Servite (11-7-1, 5-3).

SUNSET LEAGUE SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; ERRORS PLAGUE TEAMS AS MARINA BEATS OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It should have been a pitchers' duel, an intense drama played out over seven 
innings -- or more. 
</P>
<P>
 It should have been one of the best games of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 It should have been . . . different. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, two of the county's best teams played a comedy of errors behind two 
of the county's best pitchers Friday at Marina High, and the Vikings yukked up 
a 5-2 victory over sixth-ranked Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-ranked Marina (15-2, 7-1) retained its hold on first place in the 
Sunset League and the Seahawks (11-5, 4-3) made a concession speech afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither coach could fathom what they saw after the two teams combined for four 
errors apiece and seven unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't played this poorly, defensively, all year long," Marina Coach 
Shelly Luth said. "I don't ever remember us making four errors. Defensively, I 
couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 And Ocean View -- well, its hallmark is defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can win the league title now," Ocean View Coach John Sansone 
said. "At this point, we're rooting for Marina -- they're our ally." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings are Ocean View's new best friends because three Sunset League 
teams will reach the playoffs and the Seahawks trail Marina, Huntington Beach 
and Fountain Valley. All have been ranked among the county's top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina pitcher Marcy Crouch (11-2, seven hits, six strikeouts) benefited from 
four unearned runs in the third inning against Ocean View's Kathy Ponce (11-4, 
five strikeouts). 
</P>
<P>
 Ponce allowed only four hits, but consecutive one-out errors and singles by 
Faith Fuata and Heather Williams scored two runs. After a walk and a fielder's 
choice, another error made it 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View scored twice in the fifth inning. After a pair of errors, the 
Seahawks got a run-scoring single from Mookie Hatcher and an RBI grounder from 
Janee Sansone. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina scored another run in the bottom of the fifth -- Fuata's second single 
and a two-out error. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be a one-run game," said Ponce, who was pitching for the 
first time in two days after stepping in a gopher hole at practice. "I didn't 
expect it to end up like this." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 5, Edison 0 -- Stefanie Noffsinger, on the mound for the 
first time since April 1 when a batted ball fractured her right eye socket, 
pitched a no-hitter for the seventh-ranked Oilers (12-6, 6-2). She struck out 
13, including the final eight, giving her 49 in 33 2/3 innings, and hasn't 
allowed an earned run. She is wearing a hockey helmet with a face shield while 
she pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosary 12, Santa Ana 1 (5, mercy) -- Nicola Walsh pitched a one-hitter, struck 
out 10, had two hits, scored twice and drove in a run for visiting Rosary 
(11-5, 4-4). Anna Villalpando had two hits, including her second home run, and 
three RBIs.

NORTHRIDGE GOES WITHOUT A FIGHT, 9-0; COLLEGE BASEBALL: BUT MATADORS SHOW SOME 
FIRE AFTER THE GAME, SCUFFLING AMONG THEMSELVES IN THE WAKE OF RIVERA'S 
FIVE-HIT SHUTOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The plot thins. 
</P>
<P>
 The clean-up hitter was benched for disciplinary reasons, a scuffle broke out 
among teammates after the game, Cal State Northridge rolled a zero at home for 
the second time in six years and set a record for single-season defeats over 
the same span. 
</P>
<P>
 And it could get worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are going to blow out the negatives in everything (statistically) 
before this year is over," Coach Bill Kernen said. "We're seeing a lot of 
things that have never been seen around here before." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Matadors didn't see Friday were runs. Right-hander Willie Rivera 
pitched a five-hitter as Cal State Sacramento trounced Northridge, 9-0, in a 
Western Athletic Conference game at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera, a junior transfer from Valley College, recorded only the second 
shutout of the Matadors at Northridge in Kernen's six-year tenure.  
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors fell to 21-23, setting a single-season record for defeats under 
Kernen, who has led the team to three consecutive NCAA Division I playoff 
berths. Any chance for a fifth consecutive postseason trip for the Matadors -- 
who fell to 9-7 in WAC West Division play -- is slipping away by the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Rivera's former Valley coaches and teammates watched him strike out 
seven, walk three and generally waltz through the Matador lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Ive, also attended the game, marking the first time she'd seen her 
son pitch since the sixth grade. Nice timing, Mom. Rivera (3-4), a graduate of 
Burbank High, allowed hits to the first two batters, three thereafter and none 
beyond the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 All this from a guy who is listed at 5-foot-9 in the Sacramento (21-20, 8-8) 
program. Ain't so, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm barely breaking 5-8," Rivera said with a grin. " No way I'm 5-9." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Northridge has giant problems, which isn't exactly news. 
</P>
<P>
 While meeting in left field for the team's customary postgame talk, 
frustration boiled over when pitcher Marco Contreras and third baseman Tyler 
Nelson had to be separated. 
</P>
<P>
 As the scuffle erupted, Kernen seemed equal parts embarrassed and upset. After 
several players fired pieces of equipment and apparel around the dugout, he 
quieted the team with a verbal blast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only emotion we show the whole day was directed against ourselves," 
Kernen said. "That sums up the whole deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. Clean-up hitter Keyaan Cook, batting .321, was benched for skipping 
class and arriving late to practice. Seldom-used Steve Moreno, batting .083, 
took over for Cook at second base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't compromise the basic requirements it takes to play here," Kernen 
said. "We'll continue to do this on my terms, win or lose."

CARROLL ROLLS INTO SEMIFINALS; TENNIS: VENTURA SKATEBOARDER, 13, WINS TWO 
MATCHES AT OJAI, INCLUDING 3 1/2-HOUR MARATHON AGAINST 12-AND-UNDER CHAMPION. 
</P>

<P>
 A sudden sensation? No. A Johnny Come Lately? Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's just say Erin Carroll of Ventura could be skating his way to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll, 13, says tennis is his favorite sport, and he's playing a splendid 
game right now. Three victories in the past two days have put him into today's 
semifinal round of the boys' 14-and-under singles at the 95th Ojai Valley 
tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But tennis is not the only passion for Carroll, an avid skateboarder. He's the 
type of kid who would ride his board to his private tennis lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has gotten him into trouble at times. The Cabrillo Junior High 
eighth-grader has sprained an ankle and wrenched his back while doing tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday he was all business. First, Carroll knocked off national 
12-and-under champion Nicholas Weiss of Tarzana, 6-7 (7-4), 6-2, 7-6 (7-5). 
Weiss had won the Copper Bowl, a national hard-court tournament, last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 After surviving a 3 1/2-hour marathon against Weiss, Carroll coasted against 
Travis Hasson of San Luis Obispo, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatigue wasn't a problem for Carroll, a strong serve-and-volley player -- 
especially after a mid-afternoon venue change. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll and Weiss slugged it out at Ojai Valley School, a quaint and quiet 
little campus on the highway. When the 14-and-under draw got behind schedule, 
Carroll's match with Hasson was moved to Libbey Park, Ojai's "center court" 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It pumped me up, playing in front of a bunch of people," Carroll said. "It 
was kind of cool." 
</P>
<P>
 It was cool to win. Carroll recently tried his first tournament -- the Easter 
Bowl in Miami -- and lost in the first round, albeit to the No. 3-seeded 
player. Phillip Nguyen beat him, 7-6, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, who turned 12 in January, and Carroll battled tooth and nail until 
Weiss said he'd had enough and conceded a line call on match point. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll, leading, 6-5, in the tiebreaker, hit a passing shot. Weiss signaled 
out but then said it was in after Carroll made an appeal to the line judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have gone either way," Weiss said. "The line judge said it was my 
call; he pretty much gave it to me. I gave (Carroll) the call. I don't know 
why. Twenty-five people asked me why I did that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so dead. My feet were killing me. I couldn't walk." 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll, two victories away from a championship, praised his younger opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd be No. 1 if he was playing 12s," Carroll said.

BACK ON THE MOUND AGAIN, HART'S SANCHEZ CLEANS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hart High junior right-hander Luis Sanchez had not pitched in two weeks 
because of a bad back. So, you wonder, how did he kill his time? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working on my hitting a lot," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Result: Sanchez hit a grand slam in the first inning Friday against Saugus, 
providing all the runs he would need on the mound in the Indians' 10-3 Foothill 
League victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sanchez's hitting was secondary. While improving his record to 4-1 this 
season and 17-2 in his three varsity seasons at Hart, Sanchez struck out 10 
Saugus hitters, mostly with a nasty, late-breaking curve ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "That had some bite, didn't it?" Hart Coach Bud Murray said, showing the broad 
smile of a coach whose team took a key step on the road toward a Foothill 
League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart (14-4, 6-0 in league play) is two games ahead of Saugus (12-5-1, 4-2). 
Although each team has six league games remaining, Hart has won its first two 
meetings with the Centurions. They will meet for the final time at Hart next 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we've won the league already, but this has really made us 
confident," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart confidently ripped Brandon Hernandez (2-3) of Saugus, starting the game 
with consecutive singles by Jeremy Seipel and Brian Baron. After a walk to 
Aaron Dean, Sanchez did what a good cleanup hitter does -- he cleaned the bases 
with his second home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was up today," Hernandez said. "It just didn't come down a couple 
times. I hung a curve (to Sanchez). That was my mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart put the game away with Saugus' help in the third. Two Centurion errors 
and five hits resulted in five more runs and a 9-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez finished the game with three hits, including a double. Mike Espy, Mike 
Adachi and Seipel each added two hits for the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Saugus' offense was provided by catcher Jeff Brown, who had three 
hits, including a solo home run in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who had a double, said he thought Saugus was intimidated by Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think we need to change our mentality when we play Hart," Hernandez 
said. "It seems like year after year they're always beating us."

BIRMINGHAM'S LINCOLN JUMPS FOR JOY AFTER BECOMING A DAD; TRACK AND FIELD: 
GIRLFRIEND GIVES BIRTH TO A SON, THEN SENIOR WINS FOUR EVENTS AGAINST MONROE IN 
CONFERENCE MEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Already regarded as one of the region's most versatile track and field 
performers, James Lincoln of Birmingham High was given a much more important 
title at 1 a.m. Friday when he became the proud father of a 7-pound 2-ounce boy 
named Jahsaan Dakise Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln and his girlfriend, Jovonna Cord, were up most of the night with their 
newborn child before Lincoln grabbed three hours of sleep. After attending 
classes, he won four events to lead Birmingham to a 77 1/2-49 1/2 victory over 
Monroe in a Valley Pac-8 Conference meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the 56th in a row in dual-meet competition for Birmingham 
(6-0, 6-0 in league meets) and gave the Braves at least a share of their 
seventh consecutive conference title. They can win the title outright with a 
victory against Van Nuys next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a big day. A lot has happened," Lincoln said with a broad smile. 
"I'm really satisfied with the way things went today." 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln, who has signed a national letter of intent with Cal State Northridge, 
began the meet by winning the 110-meter high hurdles in 15.1 seconds and 
leading Birmingham to a 1-2-3 sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 He followed that with victories in the long jump (wind-aided 22 feet 2 
inches), high jump (6-4) and triple jump (a personal best of 46-0 1/2) as 
Birmingham repelled a Monroe charge by outscoring the Vikings, 29-3, in the 
last four events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I would win four events coming in here," Lincoln said. "But I 
definitely wanted to improve some of my marks. I wasn't real happy where a 
couple of them were. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go 7-2 in the high jump, because (Jahsaan) weighed 7 pounds 2 
ounces, but my steps were just totally off today. But I did go 22 feet in the 
long jump and that was important because he was born on the 22nd." 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln, who has a personal best of 6-10 in the high jump, never got untracked 
in that event. It took him three attempts to clear his opening height of 6-2 
and two attempts to make 6-4 before going on to the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel like I was going to jump very high at all," he said. "So I just 
decided to call it a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln's best performance was his last as he improved upon his previous best 
of 45-10, despite jumping into a head wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe (5-1, 5-1), led by double winners Kenny Hopson and Jose Padilla, won 
six of the 10 track events, but Birmingham won all five field events, 
outscoring the Vikings, 38-7, in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think things went pretty much as expected," Birmingham Coach Scott King 
said. "We knew they were going to do well in the sprints and distance races 
with Padilla, but we also knew we had a chance to sweep other events." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopson ran 10.9 in the 100 and 22.3 in the 200 to lead Monroe to 1-2-3 
finishes, but Birmingham swept the high hurdles, high jump, pole vault and 
shotput. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla timed 4 minutes 30.2 seconds in the 1,600 and 10:01.0 in the 3,200 for 
Monroe, which produced a season best of 42.4 to win the 400 relay.

NORTHRIDGE MEN IN STEP FOR FINAL VOLLEYBALL BREAKTHROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That last step is a real lulu. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the past four years, the Cal State Northridge men's volleyball team 
has inched a little closer to a national title. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Matadors earned their first postseason tournament berth. They 
lost in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, they advanced to the semifinals before losing.  
</P>
<P>
 The following season, they won two matches and fell in the tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last season, Northridge won the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation 
tournament and advanced to the NCAA Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 All that's left now is to win it. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, there is the fairly daunting task of earning a return trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (17-9) needs three consecutive victories to win the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation tournament title and the probable Final Four bid that 
comes with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors open tournament play today at 4 p.m. against Pepperdine (13-8) in 
Stanford's Maples Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 In other first-round action, Brigham Young (19-5) plays Hawaii (14-13) at 11 
a.m., USC (16-6) meets San Diego State (17-11) at 1:30 p.m., and top-ranked 
UCLA (25-1) faces second-ranked Stanford (18-8) at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the UCLA-Stanford match is conference champion and earns the 
MPSF's automatic berth in the Final Four.  
</P>
<P>
 The loser drops back into the tournament semifinals, which will be played 
Monday at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament championship match is Tuesday at 7 p.m., with the winner likely 
to receive the only at-large berth in the NCAA Final Four, May 6-7 in Fort 
Wayne, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge defeated USC, Pepperdine and Cal State Long Beach in the MPSF 
tournament last season, then downed Penn State in the NCAA semifinals before 
being swept by UCLA in the title match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be tough to top last year, but we've improved every year," Northridge 
Coach John Price said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we'll do if we win it. Go to the Caribbean and retire, I 
think." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine leads the series with Northridge, 19-11, but the Matadors have won 
10 of the last 12 meetings, including the only two matches this season.  
</P>
<P>
 Northridge swept the Waves at Pepperdine on March 23 and rallied to win April 
13 at Northridge.

HALPERN IS LATEST COACH TO STEP DOWN; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: HE RESIGNS FROM 
RESEDA, BECOMING THE FOURTH NORTHWEST VALLEY CONFERENCE COACH TO QUIT THIS 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The coaching attrition rate in the Northwest Valley Conference climbed another 
notch Friday when Reseda High basketball Coach Jeff Halpern announced his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Halpern, 50, said he quit because he was "burned out, tired and having a hard 
time getting fired up about coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Halpern coached at Reseda for six seasons and previously coached at Van Nuys 
and Birmingham. He leaves with an eight-year record of 117-56. His teams had 
winning records in all but two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Halpern said the past three seasons -- which included a battle with the City 
Section over releaguing, the controversial year-round calendar that disrupted 
two seasons and an earthquake that severely damaged the Reseda gym -- put him 
over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been three years of total frustration," Halpern said. 
</P>
<P>
 Halpern becomes the fourth coach in the Northwest Valley to resign this year, 
following Dick Crowell of San Fernando, Jim Woodard of Taft and Sandy Greentree 
of Chatsworth. What's more, Bob Johnson of Granada Hills retired after the 
1992-93 season and Mike McNulty of El Camino Real resigned following 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Kennedy's Yutaka Shimizu and Cleveland's Kevin Crider will enter the 
1994-95 season with more than two years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Halpern said he hasn't ruled out a return to coaching, but said he plans to 
pursue opportunities as an administrator in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. He is dean of students at Reseda and a member of the City's sports 
ruling body, the Interscholastic Athletics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the players Halpern coached were Anthony Cook (Arizona), Keith Owens 
(UCLA), Marquis Burns (UCLA) and Trenton Cross, who will play next season at 
Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 His 1986-87 Birmingham team fell to Granada Hills in the City 3-A Division 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda, top-seeded in the 3-A playoffs this season, was hurt by injuries to 
several key players and fell in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Halpern said no replacement has been chosen.

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE VOLLEYBALL ROUNDUP; TRAN, LASKE LEAD LOS AMIGOS TO VICTORY

 Kiet Tran and Brian Laske combined for 46 of Los Amigos' 56 kills as the Lobos 
beat La Quinta, 7-15, 15-6, 15-5, 7-15, 15-9, in a Garden Grove League match 
Friday at Los Amigos. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, who pounded down a match-high 25 kills, led the first game with six, but 
the Lobos committed eight errors while scoring only seven points. The game 
ended with a Los Amigos pass and set, but no one stepped forward to hit the 
ball, which rose 10 feet into the air and dropped quietly into a campfire 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Amigos (12-2, 7-1) came back in the second game, as Tran contributed 
five kills and a solo block. Laske led the attack in the third game, with eight 
kills. The senior had 21 total kills. 
</P>
<P>
 But La Quinta (8-5, 7-2) was not through. Leading 7-5 in the fourth game, the 
Aztecs went on a five-point run, then after two Lobos points, Tran hit long and 
then wide to make it 14-7. Lobo Coach Dave Avalos called a timeout, but he had 
no more left so the Aztecs were awarded the point and the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos took a 6-0 lead behind Tony Troung's serve in the fifth game, then 
scored two more points to make it 8-0, and the difference was too much for La 
Quinta, which made 14 errors in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Down 14-6, match point, Dave Rosenthal came to the serving line. All night, 
good things had happened to the Aztecs behind Rosenthal's serve. 
</P>
<P>
 They had gone on runs of five, four, three and two points -- they always 
scored at least once when Rosenthal was at the line. But the Aztecs mustered 
only two more points before Ken King's shot didn't go over, giving the Lobos 
the side out, and Kevin Doane's spike yawned into the net. HEATHER STEVENS

CITY COACHES TO RECONSIDER RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A meeting of the Los Angeles Football Coaches Assn., representing City Section 
coaches, will be held at University High on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will discuss the possible repeal of a recently enacted City rule 
which eliminated spring seven-on-seven passing-league competition.Out-of-season 
teams presently are prohibited from practicing after school. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the rule was changed last year, many City schools participated in 
spring passing-league competition. However, some coaches have expressed a 
desire to return to the old format. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the existing rule, City schools may participate in passing-league 
competition from June 6 to July 17.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; NORTHRIDGE GAINS SPLIT IN SOFTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After committing three errors and losing the opener, 2-1, Cal State Northridge 
responded with 13 hits in the second game to beat Utah, 7-0, and earn a split 
in a Western Athletic Conference softball doubleheader Friday in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 The split leaves the teams deadlocked in second place at 11-3 in WAC play, two 
games behind Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge right-hander Amy Windmiller (18-2), who entered the game with the 
lowest earned-run average among NCAA Division I pitchers, allowed four hits in 
the opener. Utah scored two unearned runs in the second inning and the 
fourth-ranked Matadors could not recover. The defeat snapped a 14-game winning 
streak for Windmiller, whose ERA is 0.20. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Cyndee Bennett, a graduate of Glendale High, doubled to lead off the 
second and scored on an errant throw by Northridge third baseman Shannon Jones. 
Tricia Beer scored later on a passed ball to give 15th-ranked Utah (33-9) a 2-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, Northridge (36-7) was paced by three-for-four performances 
by Beth Calcante and Jennifer Parker. Jones went two for two with two runs 
batted in on sacrifice flies. 
</P>
<P>
 Matador right-hander Kathy Blake (12-5) allowed seven hits and recorded her 
ninth shutout. BASEBALL

three runs the lead the Kingsmen (22-5-1, 15-1) in a Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference game. Sebbo, Becker, Kirk Fellows and Joe 
Gordon homered for the Kingsmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Biola 4, The Master's 0 -- For the second consecutive day, the Mustangs 
(11-28-2) fell victim to a shutout in an NAIA District 3 game at La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenya Hunt had two of the Mustangs' four hits against Mike Gerlitz (6-2), who 
struck out three and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Davis (3-2) of Master's allowed four earned runs on 11 hits and four 
walks in eight innings, striking out four.

1993-94 TIMES ALL-VENTURA COUNTY BOYS' BASKETBALL TEAM; PLAYER OF THE YEAR; 
HARTMAN IMPROVED AND TEAM FOLLOWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The year-round commitment Jason Hartman made to basketball came full circle, 
exactly as he mapped it out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks High senior with the rugged playing style and pleasant 
disposition once again led his team to a Marmonte League championship. And once 
again he is a member of The Times' All-Ventura County team. 
</P>
<P>
 What about some gravy, a payoff for 12 months of diligence? 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman is the player of the year, following in the footsteps of teammates 
Paul Foster (1993) and Chris Loll (1991). Other winners have included 
Washington Bullets' forward Don MacLean (Simi Valley, 1988) and UCLA guard Shon 
Tarver (Santa Clara, 1989 and '90). 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1992-93 season, in which he helped Thousand Oaks to a 27-3 record, 
Hartman played all summer for Los Angeles-based Team Avia against some of the 
top competition in the nation. His game -- as well as his confidence -- stepped 
up dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvement was duly noted by college recruiters and Hartman committed to 
Washington during the early-signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvement also made Hartman the county's dominant player. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a midseason hand injury that curtailed his scoring, he averaged 18.9 
points a game. Equally adept at driving the lane and shooting from long-range, 
Hartman displayed great offensive versatility. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also the league's best on the boards, averaging 11.1 rebounds. The 
6-foot-7, 230-pound forward was an intimidating presence, and he was not shy 
about throwing his weight around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love a physical style," he said. "I became more physical over the summer 
and it carried right over into the season. I'm sure I'll be the same way at 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks had won three consecutive league titles with Loll and brothers 
Paul and Nick Foster leading the way. This year it was Hartman's turn and he 
transformed an inexperienced Lancer team into a league champion that finished 
with a 21-7 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason's leadership really emerged this year," Coach Ed Chevalier said. "He 
asserted himself and did what it took for us to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks began the league season with two defeats, and after the second 
Hartman sat on the bench with tears of frustration in his eyes. He vowed to 
spearhead the changes necessary for the team to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers won 10 of their next 13 games to rack up their fourth league title 
in a row and advance to the second round of the Southern Section Division I-A 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 From Hartman's standpoint, the circle was complete. BOYS' BASKETBALL TEAM 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Aylsworth / G 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore / Westlake 
</P>
<P>
 He started the season as the sixth man but ended up leading the Warriors in 
scoring (16.3 per game), assists (4.3) and steals (2.5). At 5-10, he was the 
shortest player on a 16-7 team. Aylsworth was at his best late in several key 
Marmonte League games. 
</P>
<P>
 Damian Cantrell / F 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Santa Clara 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell was the county's most-improved player, going from sixth-man status as 
a junior to the driving force behind Santa Clara's surge into the state 
playoffs. Cantrell, 6-4, was Frontier League tri-player of the year, averaging 
22.5 points and 8.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Escamilla / G 
</P>
<P>
 Junior / Santa Paula 
</P>
<P>
 Escamilla led the county with 78 three-point baskets. In his first varsity 
season, the 6-1 sharp-shooter paced Santa Paula to a 17-9 record and a 
second-place finish in the Frontier League. Escamilla was named tri-player of 
the year in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hartman / F 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman, The Times' player of the year, is a returning member of the 
all-county team. Thousand Oaks won the Marmonte League championship all four 
years Hartman played for the Lancers. The 6-8 forward will continue his career 
at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 John-Ryan Kern / F 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Kern, son of former Ohio State quarterback Rex Kern, was a bright spot in 
Ventura's disappointing 10-14 season. He played three positions depending on 
the needs of the team, and averaged a team-high 17.2 points while playing 
outstanding defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbie Knight / F 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Buena 
</P>
<P>
 Knight led Buena in scoring and rebounding, averaging 19.9 points and 9.5 
rebounds. In a rebuilding season, Buena counted on Knight for clutch play and 
he responded. The team finished second in the Channel League and upset Thousand 
Oaks in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Lauer / G 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Lauer, a three-year starter, provided a young Lancer team with experience. The 
6-1 off-guard was the team's best pure shooter and averaged 16.8 points. Lauer 
also led the team with 111 assists, becoming a well-rounded player who made few 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Sebek / G 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Nordhoff 
</P>
<P>
 Sebek, whose father Dick is the Nordhoff coach, led the county in scoring 
(24.5 points) and rebounding (11.2) despite playing for a team that was 8-16. 
The 6-2 three-year starter made 63 three-point shots and was Frontier League 
tri-player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Simmons / F 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons was a solid rock in the Pioneers' tumultuous season. The rugged 6-3, 
180-pound Simmons, who also was an all-county football player, led the team in 
scoring with a 14.5-point average. He also averaged 4.5 rebounds, 3.1 assists 
and 2.1 steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Williams / G 
</P>
<P>
 Junior / Oak Park 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was the best of a talented group of players who led the team to its 
finest season. The Eagles were 22-3 and won their first Tri-Valley League 
title. The 6-3 Williams was the league's most valuable player, averaging 16.2 
points and 7.8 rebounds. Times All-Star Basketball Rosters All-Ventura Boys

RESPECT FOR CAMPBELL HALL

<P>
 The calendar is a canard. A bunch of bunk. Complete hooey. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolteachers have been rounding off the truth for decades. There aren't 365 
days in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, in fact, 365 1/4. Ask Galileo, Copernicus or that elongated 
basketball player from Campbell Hall High. 
</P>
<P>
 Every fourth year, a full day -- Feb. 29 -- is added to the calendar to erase 
the quarter-days that have piled up. 
</P>
<P>
 Four quarters? And it's commonly called Leap Year? Curious that one of the 
area's best-known basketball players was born on Feb. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Lopez, a 6-foot-11 center, completed the final quarter of his 
high-profile career in impressive fashion by leading the Vikings to the 
Southern Section Division V-AA championship last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question Alex brought a lot of notoriety and respect to the 
program," said his former coach, Joe Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention those championship banners. In Lopez's four seasons on the 
Campbell Hall varsity, the Vikings played in a Southern Section final three 
times, winning twice. 
</P>
<P>
 At Campbell Hall, quantum -Leap Year came in 1990, when Big Alex enrolled as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his arrival at Campbell Hall, Lopez was a gangly 14-year-old who was 
known for one reason: He already was 6-9 and played basketball, which tends to 
turn heads to the point of whiplash. 
</P>
<P>
 Some noggins did the Linda Blair 360-degree spin when Lopez announced he was 
enrolling at Campbell Hall, a private school with an enrollment of 265 and 
almost no athletic tradition. Campbell Hall's gym is located a stone's throw 
from the Ventura Freeway, but athletically, it was down at the end of Lonely 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, so was the introverted, self-conscious Lopez. Getting a complete 
sentence out of him as an early teen was next to impossible. In the presence of 
adults, he spent plenty of time staring at his size-18 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like to talk then," he said. "I've grown in a lot of ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez didn't talk the talk or walk the walk, so in retrospect, Campbell Hall 
probably was his ideal destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who at the time lived in the Kennedy High attendance area, decided 
Campbell Hall offered the best chance to play immediately and grow socially. 
The school's strong academic program also was a strong selling point, and Lopez 
will graduate with a B average. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, the school had a B-grade basketball team before the arrival of Lopez 
and junior guard Austin McKellar in 1990-91. The boys' basketball team had 
never recorded a winning season. 
</P>
<P>
 Put a solid player or two on the floor in Division V-AA, and voila , instant 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alex is to Campbell Hall what Mitchell Butler was to Oakwood a few years 
ago," Jackson said. "After Alex, the school was able to attract 
student-athletes, not just students." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and McKellar, a talented transfer from St. Monica, led the Vikings on a 
storybook journey. They defeated powerful North Hollywood in a tournament game 
and advanced to the Southern Section Division V-AA final at Occidental College, 
where they lost to Brentwood, 64-49. 
</P>
<P>
 Bumps began to appear along the way, though. The team advanced to the Southern 
California regional tournament, but the team bus driver got lost in the fog 
near Fresno and the Vikings showed up late and lost a first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson believes some administrators lost their internal compass as well. 
After the season ended, Jackson was ordered to clean out his desk at 
mid-semester. Jackson was too brusque to suit the tastes of many Campbell Hall 
parents, but was popular with many students. 
</P>
<P>
 Players and students who opposed the dismissal picketed the entrance to the 
conservative school, carrying placards that read, "Just Say Joe." 
</P>
<P>
 The school said no and replaced Jackson with the professorial Jon Palarz, who 
led the team to a pair of Division V-AA titles. Campbell Hall later made an 
out-of-court settlement with Jackson for an undisclosed sum. The tiff, however, 
lasted several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly everyday stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez helped put Campbell Hall on the map, all right. In a way, the Gargantuan 
in the post position created a monster of a different kind by the level of 
expectation that he raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez recalls being somewhat overwhelmed by it all. From the "finger pointing" 
that Lopez said took place when he and McKellar enrolled, to Jackson's 
dismissal, it was a feast-or-famine season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard," Lopez said. "I just didn't understand what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he had plenty to learn on the floor as well. Despite being one of the 
tallest teens around, at the time he was Alexander the Not-So-Great. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe Lopez remains a work in progress, that the project isn't quite 
finished. He feels he has progressed to the point where he needs only a light 
sanding before he shellacks the opposition in college. He will attend 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was skinny, I wasn't as fast a runner, I didn't have a shot or anything, no 
power game," Lopez said, ticking off deficiencies he has worked hard to 
eliminate. "I needed all of that, and I feel I'm on my way now." 
</P>
<P>
 Those familiar with Lopez's game felt that he improved considerably over the 
summer, when he played on a traveling all-star team that included Jason Hartman 
of Thousand Oaks and Arthur Lee of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 College recruiters, always on the lookout for front-court players with size, 
took note. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez traded elbows over the summer with some big names and bigger bodies -- 
such as UCLA signees omm'A Givens and J.R. Henderson -- and soaked up the 
experience like a sponge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that if I get in the post, man-on-man, I can't be stopped," said 
Lopez, who averaged 18.4 points and 3.3 blocked shots as a senior. "I can get 
to the hoop. That's a big step from where I was my freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess my motto is, 'Take it up, strong.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and his mates were taken down, strong, during his junior season. 
Campbell Hall was ranked first in the state in Division V when the roof caved 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section received a tip that Campbell Hall transfer Rowan Pearson 
was maintaining two residences, a rules violation. Administrators Stan Thomas 
and Dean Crowley went to extreme measures to verify the information -- they 
staked out Pearson's home at dawn -- and Campbell Hall was ordered to forfeit 
eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, highly unorthodox stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad," Lopez said. "We had something taken away because somebody 
neglected their responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 After the forfeits, the Vikings didn't have enough victories to qualify for 
the playoffs, but school administrators didn't give up without a fight. But 
playoffs, jurisprudence and section bylaws were largely uncharted waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall administrators sought a restraining order that might have 
cleared a path into the playoffs, but their attorney filed the petition in the 
wrong courthouse. Red-faced, Campbell Hall finally dropped the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of things that happened in the last four years," Lopez 
said, shaking his head. "Strange things." 
</P>
<P>
 Strange days, indeed. But life has never been an off-the-rack proposition for 
the big fella. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost as long as Alex can remember, he could tell when a person had 
dandruff before the flakes hit their shoulders. Finding clothes has always been 
a challenge. Lopez's suit was special-ordered from a big and tall catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was younger, former UCLA forward Tracy Murray passed his game-used 
high-tops down to a grateful Alex, a big foot if ever there was one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, he gave me a lot of shoes," Lopez said, grinning. "You know, it's 
impossible to walk into Foot Locker and get size 18s." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Lopez is finished at Campbell Hall, filling those jumbo sneakers 
won't be easy. His four years went by with incredible speed -- and the Vikings 
piled up accomplishments at commensurate pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has gone by very fast," Lopez said. "It's been a lot of fun." Boys'

 Charles Adams / G 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / El Camino Real 
</P>
<P>
 Rival coaches use terms like "explosive" and "area's best pure player" to 
describe Adams, a two-time selection to the All-City Section 3-A Division team. 
The 6-4 Adams averaged 24.6 points on outside shots and explosive drives to 
lead area City players. 
</P>
<P>
 Trenton Cross: / G 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Reseda 
</P>
<P>
 Bound for Cal State Northridge, the two-time member of the All-City Section 
3-A Division squad helped his team earn top seeding in the playoffs before he 
suffered a broken bone in his foot. Cross averaged 17.4 points, 3.3 assists and 
is a two-time All-Valley pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Pharoah Davis: / C 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Highland 
</P>
<P>
 The best offensive player in the Antelope Valley landed a scholarship to 
George Mason University, where he will play for former Laker Coach Paul 
Westhead. The 6-6 post player reigned in the High Desert, averaging 22.6 points 
and 11.0 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Lairson: / F 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Palmdale 
</P>
<P>
 A great athlete who also excelled in football, Lairson averaged 16.4 points, 
5.4 rebounds and shot 57.4% from three-point range. Palmdale (24-4) was ranked 
No. 1 in the area by The Times after advancing to the Southern Section Division 
I-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Lee / G 
</P>
<P>
 Junior / North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot Lee averaged 17.7 points, 4.5 assists and 3.3 steals and is one of 
the top guards in the City Section and top juniors in the area. College 
recruiters initially interested in senior teammate Fantasia Johnson seemed to 
focus as much on Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Lopez: / C 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Campbell Hall 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, the Valley Player of the Year, led the Vikings to their second Southern 
Section Division V-AA title in three years. Lopez, who has signed with 
Washington, averaged 18.4 points and 3.3 blocked shots for the only area team 
to win a section title. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Minor / G 
</P>
<P>
 Junior / Canyon 
</P>
<P>
 Minor set school records for points in a season (619), game (33) and career 
(1,138), and for three-point field goals in a season (67) and career (140). The 
point guard led the Cowboys in assists (4.2) and steals (2.5) and made 83.1% of 
his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Ollie / C 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 This 6-5 post player was dominant inside. Ollie averaged 18 rebounds and 4.5 
blocked shots, both highs in the region. He also ranked among City scoring 
leaders with a 20.1 point average. North Hollywood was 68-10 in Ollie's three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard O'Neill / G 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Crescenta Valley 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill's season began with a 41-point game against El Rancho, and did not end 
until surprising Crescenta Valley advanced to the state playoffs. The 6-foot 
O'Neill led the team with a 23.0-point scoring average in his first season as a 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody Patterson / C 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Hart 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, a 6-6 center, led a team that finished 20-2 and won a third 
consecutive Foothill League championship. Patterson, who will play at BYU, 
averaged 15.2 points and 7.9 rebounds. He has a great knack for turning 
offensive rebounds into points. Times' All-Star Basketball Rosters

 Kelsi Armbruster kept Orange Coast in the game with her pitching and helped 
end Fullerton's hopes with her bat as OCC won, 3-2, in 11 innings in an Orange 
Empire Conference softball game Friday at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Armbruster (13-6) allowed four hits and two runs in 10 2/3 innings for the 
victory.She had retired 15 in a row and and 24 of 25 before Alicia Robles 
tripled with two outs in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles scored on a wild pitch to cut the lead to 3-2. Armbruster next walked 
Melissa Graham and was replaced by Kristen Varague, who struck out Tricia 
Wedekind for the save. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast (27-11-2, 14-3) has a two-game lead over Cypress with four left. 
The teams meet May 2 in the regular-season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (21-16, 11-6) won its first nine conference games but is now four 
back and has lost two of three to OCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Armbruster's two-out single in the 11th scored Nicole Shammas to put OCC 
ahead, 2-1. Annie Presutti then singled off the third-base bag to score Tami 
Dowlin and put the Pirates up, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Dowlin also contributed with her defense at second. She reached high for a 
line drive and ranged far to her left to get a ground-ball out. Both plays came 
in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton used two errors and a passed ball to score in the first and OCC came 
back in the second on an RBI double by Stefanie Ritchey to tie it. STEVE KRESAL

1993-94 TIMES ALL-VALLEY GIRLS' BASKETBALL TEAM; COACH OF THE YEAR; HEARLIHY 
GUIDED ALEMANY OVER OBSTACLES TO TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Has there ever been a season quite like the one Melissa Hearlihy presided 
over? 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulties were well chronicled: Hearlihy returned to coach only five 
days after giving birth by Cesarean section to her first child in December; the 
school was closed in January because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Indians, whose goal all season was to advance to the state 
championship game, fell one game shy of doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the chaotic nature of the season, Alemany's -- and Hearlihy's -- 
considerable accomplishments seemed overshadowed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alemany showed character and forged through the distractions to the most 
successful season in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany went undefeated in the regular season, captured its second Southern 
Section championship in three years and finished 30-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearlihy, 32, won her 200th game at Alemany. Her record in her nine years is 
200-47, an .810 winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 She also led a team that had little depth and lost a key guard because of a 
knee injury to the Southern regional final of the state tournament. Alemany 
lost to Irvine Woodbridge, 46-41. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still disappointed," she said. "I'm 30-1 but I still feel like we should 
have been 32-0. I can't say I'm real content right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Contentment certainly does not visit Hearlihy during games, either. An 
emotional leader, she is not afraid to raise her voice when things aren't going 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes she gets really excited," said Samantha Rigley, one of Alemany's 
standouts. "It's good in a sense, because it makes us realize that she's a 
person too. Because it's not just a job for her."

1993-94 TIMES ALL-VENTURA COUNTY GIRLS' BASKETBALL TEAM; PLAYER OF THE YEAR; 
BUENA'S GIORDANO LEAVES A CHAMPION 
</P>

<P>
 Michelle Giordano remembers how it felt to be a freshman playing on the 
tradition-rich Buena High varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole year, I was really nervous," she said. "You don't really know what 
to expect, so you just try to play it off." 
</P>
<P>
 If that's true, then she fooled everyone, because even as a freshman reserve 
it was obvious Giordano was a special player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she was mature beyond her years, not only physically but mentally 
and emotionally," Coach Joe Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, though, Giordano had no grand plan for a storybook career. She, 
along with teammate Laura Dahl, simply dealt with being the first freshmen to 
play for the school's varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just happy to be playing varsity basketball and contributing," she 
said. "I didn't think it was going to end up anything like the career I ended 
up having." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps she could have guessed, because from the first day to the final game 
of her senior season, Giordano made a career of making Buena history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Ventura County player of the year, Giordano finished as the 
school's all-time scoring and rebounding leader with 1,615 points and 815 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs advanced to the Southern Section Division I-A championship all 
four years she was on the team, and Giordano led Buena to section titles in her 
final two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1993 championship game, she made two free throws with no time remaining 
to give the Bulldogs a one-point victory over Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 And the 6-foot center scored 18 points in this season's championship game 
against Bishop Amat, which marked the first time in Vaughan's successful 19 
years as coach that the Bulldogs won consecutive section titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano has been the Channel League's most valuable player the past three 
years and an All-State Division I selection the past two. 
</P>
<P>
 She averaged 14.7 points and 7.4 rebounds during her career, outstanding 
statistics considering Buena's team-oriented style. 
</P>
<P>
 She suffered a strained medial collateral ligament in her right knee midway 
through the season and missed five games but returned to lead the Bulldogs to 
the section title. 
</P>
<P>
 Next season she will play for Arizona, and her thoughts are turned there, but 
she savors her four years at Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never dreamed I'd get my name in all the record books," she said. "It gives 
people a way of remembering me, because there's always going to be someone 
better who comes along. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy that they'll get to remember me in some way." GIRLS' BASKETBALL

</P>
<P>
 Hotchkiss, who entered the season with a reputation as an overemotional, 
undisciplined player, enjoyed a breakthrough, trouble-free campaign. She 
averaged 14.9 points, was named Marmonte League co-player of the year and led 
the Raiders to the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel McSorley / C 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Nordhoff 
</P>
<P>
 The two-time Frontier League player of the year is a repeat All-County 
selection by The Times. She led the Rangers to consecutive league titles and a 
16-0 league record the past two seasons. McSorley averaged 17.6 points and nine 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer Peterson / C 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Rio Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, a Times All-County repeat selection, averaged 11.7 points and 9.3 
rebounds for the Spartans. The 6-2 post player led Rio Mesa to the Division 
II-AA quarterfinals, where the Spartans nearly upset eventual state finalist 
Irvine Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanon Sincock / F 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Westlake 
</P>
<P>
 The four-year starter averaged 12.3 points, 6.7 rebounds and 3.4 assists and 
was the Warriors' top defensive player. Opposing coaches liked Sincock's 
outside shooting ability and work ethic. Sincock also excelled on Westlake's 
volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Tuimoloau / C 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Channel Islands 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-0 Tuimoloau was a physical presence for the Raiders (23-4), 
defending and scoring on the inside. She averaged 14 points and was an 
All-Marmonte League selection. She also is this season's state leader in the 
shot put with a throw of 47 feet 1/4 inch. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Wastell / G 
</P>
<P>
 Junior / Newbury Park 
</P>
<P>
 Wastell, a repeat Times All-County selection, was the co-most valuable player

1993-94 TIMES ALL-VALLEY GIRLS' BASKETBALL TEAM; PLAYER OF THE YEAR; RIGLEY 
TOOK CONTROL TO RESCUE ALEMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One need only look at a one-minute stretch to understand Samantha Rigley's 
value to the Alemany High basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut to the Southern Section Division II-A championship game against San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians are undefeated and have barely been challenged all season. They 
have a comfortable lead over the Cardinals until the end of the third quarter, 
when ultra-quick San Bernardino guard LaTonya Kindle catches fire and sparks a 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in a row Kindle steals the ball from Alemany's point guard and scores on 
breakaway layups. 
</P>
<P>
 In a flash, Alemany's lead is cut to three points and the Indians are visibly 
shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Rigley. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-10 forward inbounds the ball and immediately demands it back. She 
will bring the ball up the floor. Kindle is all over her, itching for a steal. 
Rigley shields her away, fakes her once, twice, three times, daring Kindle. 
</P>
<P>
 After about 15 seconds, Kindle finally fouls her, and Rigley makes both free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty seconds later, Rigley burns Kindle with a cross-over dribble at 
midcourt, another fake in the lane and makes a tough layup with her left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany leads by seven and hangs on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the bottom line with Rigley, whose determination and refusal to lose 
are at least as valuable as her pinpoint passing and clutch free-throw 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is not afraid to compete, and the kids are very confident in her," Coach 
Melissa Hearlihy said. "They're always looking to give her the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigley, a junior who often ran the offense, was selected to the all-state 
third team. 
</P>
<P>
 Her versatility was evident in her statistics. She averaged 14.8 points, six 
rebounds, four assists and three steals a game. 
</P>
<P>
 She also made 86.7% of her free throws. Her clutch shooting at the line was an 
anchor the team could cling to late in games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's been my best year at Alemany," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly was an unforgettable season. Her family's home was red-tagged 
after the Jan. 17 earthquake -- repairs have not yet begun -- and Rigley was 
shaken by the closure of her school. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also deeply upset with the Indians' 46-41 loss to Woodbridge in the 
state semifinal, one game shy of the team's goal of the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had set our sights on state, and nothing else seemed as important," she 
said. "(Winning the section championship) was a big accomplishment, but I don't 
think we even realized what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now when I think about it, I'm totally happy." Girls' Basketball Team 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Celaya / G 
</P>
<P>
 Junior / North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies' steadiest player, the 5-foot-4 Celaya averaged 20.8 points and 
5.3 assists, both tops in the Mid-Valley League. She was the league co-most 
valuable player for the second consecutive season, sharing the honor with 
teammate Darvena Merritt. 
</P>
<P>
 Carly Funicello / C 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore / Alemany 
</P>
<P>
 Funicello has remarkable agility for a 6-3 post player. She led the Indians 
with a 16-point average, grabbed nine rebounds a game and was named the state's 
sophomore player of the year. Still learning the game, she possesses enviable 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Hagman / G 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Crescenta Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman set Southern Section records with 13 three-point baskets in a game and 
121 for the season. She also was the top girls' scorer in the area with 25.4 
points a game. She led the Falcons to the Pacific League title and will play 
for Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindy James / F 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore / Village Christian 
</P>
<P>
 James, a returning All-Valley selection, led the Crusaders to the Southern 
Section Division IV-A final. She was the team leader in scoring and rebounding, 
averaging 17 points and 9.5 rebounds. She scored a career-high 33 points in the 
section title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaclyn Johnson / C 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman / Quartz Hill 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is a prodigious talent -- and didn't turn 15 until last month. She was 
the best player for the Golden League champion Rebels (19-5), who advanced to 
the Southern Section Division I-A quarterfinals. The 6-footer averaged 18 
points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly McKay / G 
</P>
<P>
 Junior / Alemany 
</P>
<P>
 McKay's quiet, controlled demeanor proved that actions speak louder than 
words. The 5-8 shooting guard was Alemany's best defender and smoothest player. 
McKay, who was named to the all-state junior team, averaged 13.8 points and 
four steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Samantha Rigley / F 
</P>
<P>
 Junior / Alemany 
</P>
<P>
 The player of the year led the Indians (30-1) to the Southern Section Division 
II-A championship. The versatile 5-10 Rigley averaged 14.8 points, six 
rebounds, four assists and three steals. She was selected to the all-state 
third team. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadra Manley / F 
</P>
<P>
 Junior / Sylmar 
</P>
<P>
 Manley led the Spartans to their best season in school history as Sylmar 
(18-3) advanced to the City Section 3-A Division quarterfinals. Manley was 
named the East Valley League's most valuable player and averaged a team-high 18 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandee Sayles / F 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Antelope Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Sayles stood out on a poor team and was named the Golden League's most 
valuable player. The 5-9 swing player averaged 22 points, 11.5 rebounds and 5.6 
assists. She possesses an excellent mid-range jump shot and is equally adept 
driving to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Christina Ticsay / G 
</P>
<P>
 Senior / Bell-Jeff 
</P>
<P>
 Ticsay, hampered her sophomore and junior seasons by a skin disorder that 
caused her body hair to fall out, enjoyed a memorable senior season. Her 
disorder was controlled by medication, and she averaged a team-high 19.5 points 
and six assists. Times' All-Star Basketball Rosters

1993-94 TIMES ALL-VENTURA COUNTY GIRLS' BASKETBALL TEAM; COACH OF THE YEAR; 
NEWBURY PARK SMARTLY LED BY A TOLERANT PARVIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newbury Park High Coach Nori Parvin seems to get better with time. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider that her best season -- and the most successful campaign in school 
history -- came in Parvin's 20th year at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy coaching," said Parvin, 44, who has a 242-200 record. "It's still fun 
and I still get excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Panther squad set a school record with 23 victories, breaking the 
record of 18 set last season. 
</P>
<P>
 And Parvin's Panthers (23-5) came within three points of advancing to the 
Southern Section Division III-AA final against Division III state champion 
Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything came into place," Parvin said. "I think we all worked together to 
make the season as successful as it was." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Ventura County coach of the year relied on a trio of talented 
juniors. Julie Wastell (11.1 points per game), Kara McKeown (8.9 points and 11 
rebounds per game) and Jann Thorpe (10.9 points, 8.0 rebounds) formed the 
nucleus of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeown broke her school rebounding record and Wastell set a school assist 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 But the statistic in which Parvin said she takes the most pride is the team's 
cumulative grade-point average, 3.76 -- for which the Panthers were honored by 
the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 At Parvin's core is tolerance and perspective, both of which she says have 
been instrumental in her success as a coach and a physical education teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my patience and my temperament are my strengths," she said. "I don't 
really get mad. I'm easy-going, not only as a coach but as a teacher."

<P>
 Guard Dion Holton, a defensive specialist for Long Beach Poly High, has 
committed to Cal State Fullerton, according to Ron Palmer, his high school 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Holton, 6 feet, averaged seven points, six rebounds and five assists."His 
great value to us was as a defensive player," Palmer said. "We usually assigned 
him to the opposing team's top scoring guard and sometimes even to the top 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shot 54% from the field, but as our playmaker he didn't shoot a lot. I 
would expect him to score more in a college system than he did for us because 
college play is more open." Palmer said other schools recruiting Holton 
included UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, Montana and Portland. LON EUBANKS

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; TITAN PITCHER PARISI GETS HIS FOURTH SHUTOUT OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton pitcher Mike Parisi set a single-season school record with 
his fourth shutout in a 4-0 victory over Pacific in a Big West Conference 
baseball game Friday night in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi (9-2), who gave up seven hits, including four doubles, walked three and 
struck out five, broke the record he shared with four others.The most recent 
was Longo Garcia in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time this season Pacific has been shut out. The Tigers 
(30-12, 4-6 in the conference) had a 21-game winning streak at one point this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Mancuso, a senior from Los Alamitos High, hit his first home run of the 
season, a two-run shot in the sixth, and Dante Powell had two doubles and two 
stolen bases for the Titans (33-8, 10-3). Jason Gill was three for three for 
Fullerton, which is ranked No. 1 in the nation by Baseball Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Big West Conference men's tennis championships: 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine 4, Pacific 1 -- Chris Tontz defeated Kevin Smith at No. 1 singles, 
6-3, 6-2, to lead UC Irvine at the Ojai Valley Racquet Club. Carlos Bustos and 
Kenny Cruz added singles victories and Tontz and Bustos and Marc Tardif and 
Julian Foxon each won in doubles for Irvine.

EL TORO'S JOHNNY FRANCE COMES UP EMPTY; TENNIS: NEWPORT HARBOR'S GEOFF ABRAMS 
DEFEATS HIS HUNGRY OPPONENT IN OJAI TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Toro's Johnny France couldn't have picked a worse day to skip his bowl of 
Wheaties. After surviving a 2 1/2-hour, three-set match against Mission Viejo's 
Brian Gruner, France was asked to beat Newport Harbor's Geoff Abrams, the 
top-seeded player in the boys' interscholastic division of the Ojai Valley 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 France wasn't quite up to the task. After winning the first game Friday, he 
dropped the next 12 and bowed out of Ojai, 6-1, 6-0, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only had about 45 minutes in between matches and I had no breakfast," 
France said. "All I had were two bananas all day." 
</P>
<P>
 It showed. By the end, France was barely able to get his returns back to the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
 "He drained me," France said of Abrams. "I'm barely standing right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams could tell his opponent lacked energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these matches up here get to you after awhile," Abrams said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not much has affected Abrams during the first two days here. Abrams has 
not dropped a set in four matches since being seeded first in the division 
hours before the tournament began. Abrams was moved from fifth to first in the 
draw when Phillip Tseng of North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of feeling pressure as the top-seeded player, Abrams has thrived on 
the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved it when it happened," he said. "It was great. I love all the 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 France, a senior, had hoped to attract a little more attention this week by 
making an appearance in the semifinals or finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple coaches, UC Irvine's and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's, have seen me up 
here, but it would have been nice to play at Libbey Park," France said. 
</P>
<P>
 But until France passes the Scholastic Aptitude Test, he won't be playing 
anywhere except at a community college. He scored a 690, 10 points short of 
passing his SATs last year and is taking the test again in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think taking that test is a lot more intense than playing in a tennis 
tournament," France said. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much intensity from France on Friday. A couple times he yelled, 
"Come on Johnny, get into the match," but it didn't do much good. France never 
appeared to get into a rhythm and he had no luck breaking Abrams' service. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you return his serve well, everything will follow from there," France 
said. "But he's just so big, it's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 How big? 
</P>
<P>
 "When we shook hands, I think came up to about his shoulders," France said of 
the 6-foot-4 Abrams, who is only a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei's Laura Ruben was also looking up at her opponent, Ania Bleszynski 
of Thousand Oaks, and she didn't have any better luck than France. Although her 
match was closer -- she lost 6-3, 6-2 in the girls' 18 quarterfinals -- Ruben 
never seriously threatened the No. 1-seeded Bleszynski, who is nearly 6 feet 
tall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some chances to close out some games, but I relaxed a little too much," 
Ruben said. "She went for a little more too and her serve was a big advantage 
(Friday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben was the last Orange County player in the girls' 18. Sarah Hawkins of 
Newport Harbor was beaten by Barbara Valkova of Bakersfield, 6-1, 6-2, in the

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: NASTER'S NO-HIT FEELING LINGERS INTO NEXT DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Jeff Naster, the magnitude of the event didn't really register until a day 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happier about it (Friday) when it finally sunk in," Naster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Naster, a sophomore right-hander at Moorpark College, had reason to smile 
after pitching a no-hitter in an 8-0 victory over Oxnard in a Western State 
Conference North Division game Thursday at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Thousand Oaks High pitcher struck out five and had a perfect game 
through six innings before walking three batters. He was in command throughout 
the game and said he knew all along that the Condors hadn't touched him for a 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first five innings, everything was working pretty much the way I wanted 
it," said Naster (7-2), who has been the Raiders' ace all season. "I was 
hitting my spots too. They hit some solid ground balls but not too many guys 
pulled the ball out of the infield." 
</P>
<P>
 Naster, 20, said he tried to keep his mind on other things besides the 
no-hitter late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the seventh through the ninth inning, I tried to talk to my teammates 
about anything," Naster said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first solo no-hitter for Naster at any level of competition, 
although he and Pierce left-hander Adam West combined on one at the age of 12 
in the Conejo Valley Little League. The two also played together on the 1992 
Newbury Oaks American Legion team that won the Legion World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "This might have topped the Legion championship," said Naster, who pitched a 
shutout in the Legion title game. "There, I thought we could beat anybody 
because we had a really strong team, but this was against Oxnard, at a higher 
caliber of competition." Brother Act 
</P>
<P>
 Messing with the Barbers has become a double-edged sword for Cal Lutheran's 
baseball opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Barber, a senior right-hander, pitches the middle innings. He is 1-1 with 
a 4.50 earned-run average in 16 innings. Andrew, his sophomore brother, closes 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're hilarious," Kingsmen Coach Marty Slimak said. "They argue and fight, 
but when the game starts they really back each other up. When one or the other 
is pitching out there, everything else stops. They're so supportive of each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew, who complements a mid-80s fastball with a hard breaking pitch, has 
become the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference's premier 
closer. In conference games, he has not allowed an earned run in 18 innings, 
allowing six hits -- all singles -- with 22 strikeouts and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall for the season, Andrew is 3-0 with three saves. In 28 innings he has 
allowed 10 hits with 27 strikeouts and nine walks. He has an earned-run average 
of 0.33 and has stranded 20 inherited runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew Andy could pitch, but it's surprised us the type of season he's 
having," Slimak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, after Andrew's debut, not much else he's done should have been much of a 
surprise. In Cal Lutheran's SCIAC opener Feb. 12, Barber pitched a seven-inning 
perfect game against Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The SCIAC's first postseason baseball tournament might also be the 
conference's last. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, the conference's top four teams will compete in a 
single-elimination tournament May 6-7, while the circuit's bottom half does the 
same. The prize for the winners? Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really kind of meaningless," Slimak said. "All it does is give us two 
more games." 
</P>
<P>
 The original idea was for the league to have separate regular-season and 
tournament champions, but the idea has fizzled. The regular-season champion 
will advance to the NCAA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Cal Lutheran -- which seems assured of being the SCIAC 
regular-season champion -- might benefit from the arrangement. The Kingsmen 
will see two of the conference's best teams, probably saving their best 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're fortunate enough to go to the regionals, it should help us prepare," 
Slimak said. CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Hit, Run, Pitch 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 victory over Hawaii last weekend, the Matadors managed only one hit 
in the last four innings. It was a ninth-inning triple, and the guy swinging 
the bat didn't surprise Coach Bill Kernen. 
</P>
<P>
 It was pitcher Brian Vasey, who was trying to close out the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just knew that had to happen," Kernen said. "The guy's got to run all the 
way to third, then try to close the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he served up a triple to Hawaii in the bottom of the ninth, Vasey held 
on for the victory. Around the Campuses. . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Oliver Heitmann, Northridge's 6-7 middle blocker, ranks among NCAA 
volleyball leaders in three categories. Heitmann is sixth with a .460 attacking 
percentage, seventh with a 6.43 kill average and 11th with a 1.53 block 
average. Collin Smith is tied for fifth with a 2.60 digs average; and Peter 
Piexoto is tied for ninth with a 2.53 digs average. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mission second baseman John Toven, a freshman from Kennedy High, has not 
been thrown out in 18 steal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ivy Calvin threw a personal best of 170-0 in the men's discus at the Mt. San 
Antonio College Relays to move into eighth on the all-time Matador list in that 
event. Calvin's previous best was 166-9. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shannon Jones, a senior third baseman on the Northridge softball team, has 
clubbed a career-high 10 home runs, including a stretch of five in 10 at-bats. 
Jones (.427) also leads the team with eight doubles and 33 runs batted in.

SHAW SAYS RAMS STILL TRYING TO OBTAIN HARPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contrary to reports across the country, John Shaw, Ram executive vice 
president, said the team is continuing to negotiate a contract with Dallas wide 
receiver Alvin Harper with the intention of trading for him during the first 
round of the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the deal is still alive," Shaw said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals have offered a second-round pick to swap positions in the first 
round with the Rams, and the Vikings have dangled both of their first-round 
picks (No. 18 and 19) in front of the Rams for the fifth selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a number of inquiries about our first-round pick," Shaw said, 
"but our intention is to take a quarterback (Tennessee's Heath Shuler or Fresno 
State's Trent Dilfer) if available, or make the trade for Harper." 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN and several newspapers reported Friday that the Rams were out of the 
Harper sweepstakes, and that Harper was headed to Cleveland on draft day. The 
Rams, however, on Friday offered Harper more money than what had been presented 
by Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, a restricted free agent, has indicated a reluctance to play in Los 
Angeles and has told friends he wishes to play in the AFC to have a better 
chance of achieving Pro Bowl recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my understanding he's thinking about our offer," Shaw said. "That's what 
we're pursuing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have agreed on a trade with Dallas contingent on Dilfer or Shuler not 
being available and Harper coming to terms. The Rams will surrender their first 
pick and receive Harper and a second-round pick from the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 The order of the first four players expected to be taken Sunday remains 
unclear, but the Rams are now thinking that Shuler and Dilfer will be gone when 
they select. They believe there is a chance San Diego State running back 
Marshall Faulk will still be on the board when they select, but they have not 
decided how they would react to such a situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Cleveland Gary, who is being counted on as Jerome Bettis' backup 
this season, is attempting to work out a contract with Pittsburgh. The Steelers 
cannot sign Gary, however, without giving the Rams the opportunity to match an 
offer. T.J. SIMERS

MICHIGAN STATE'S MILLER IN CALIFORNIA STATE OF MIND; DRAFT: QUARTERBACK WANTS 
TO PLAY FOR RAMS BUT WILL HAVE TO SEE WHO PICKS SHULER AND DILFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two names Michigan State quarterback Jim Miller doesn't want to hear if the 
Rams keep their fifth overall choice in Sunday's NFL draft: Heath Shuler and 
Trent Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller knows the Rams are interested in him, but he won't know how much until 
they announce their first-round selection in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, whom the Rams rank third among quarterbacks behind Dilfer and Shuler, 
will patiently wait at his parents' home in Waterford, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Projected as a second- to fourth-round pick, he has watched the Rams' 
draft-day saga unfold something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 They announced Wednesday that they will select Dilfer, Fresno State's 
quarterback, or Tennessee's Shuler with the fifth pick if one or both is 
available. They also are interested in selecting Nebraska strong safety Toby 
Wright with the fifth pick (33rd overall) in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 But . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams' trade talks with Dallas for wide receiver Alvin Harper and a 
second-round pick become a reality, they could use the Cowboys' pick or their 
other second-round selection (49th overall) to take Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Or . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams trade down in the first round to draft a wide receiver, 
cornerback, offensive tackle or defensive tackle, Miller could become a logical 
second-round choice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Miller waits. And wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm anxious to get this over with," he said Thursday from Waterford. "I would 
love to play in L.A. My brother lives in Irvine, and I visited him last month 
during spring break. It was a great scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the Rams pass on him, Miller estimates 15 other teams would be waiting 
to take him, including Kansas City, Detroit, Chicago, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, 
Tampa Bay and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams like Miller, 6-feet-4 and 208 pounds, because of his quick throwing 
release and his accuracy (63.9% completion percentage as a senior). A dropback 
passer, he has an adequate, but not powerful, arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel real good about him," said Ram quarterbacks coach Mike Martz, who 
watched Miller at a workout in Lansing, Mich., in February. "You hate to say 
he's a project guy because he's so accurate and he gets the ball off so 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The knock on Miller is that he's not very mobile. Scouts say he needs to be 
set when throwing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 He also played in a conservative offense that limited his attempts. He threw 
for only 4,628 yards and 16 touchdowns in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have any glaring weaknesses," Martz said. "He's not as quick afoot 
as you would like, but he played 20 pounds overweight last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was 227 during the season because somebody had told him he needed to put 
on weight. But I saw him work out at 212 pounds, and he had a great workout." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller hasn't established himself as a proven winner. Michigan State was 12-15 
after he beat out former El Toro High standout Bret Johnson as the Spartans' 
starter five games in the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, the great ones win," Miller said. "But look at Joe Montana. He had a 
great supporting cast with the 49ers (and won four Super Bowls). Then, look at 
John Elway. His teams have lost three Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go right down the line. Warren Moon hasn't won the big game yet. And 
it's not that he's a bad quarterback. It's that other things have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 So can Miller compete with free-agent acquisition Chris Miller and third-year 
player T.J. Rubley for the starting job? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got no problem with competing," he said. "There's no doubt I can do it. 
I had to compete with Bret Johnson, your guy from L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in here (Michigan State) with three of the top quarterbacks in the 
nation, and by my senior year, I was the only one left."

 Asbestos -- A story and headline in the March 30 Metro section of The Times 
incorrectly stated that South Coast Air Quality Management District officials 
had ordered the suspension of interior demolition work at St. John's Hospital 
in Santa Monica. Dillingham Construction of Long Beach has not been ordered by 
the AQMD to suspend work at the hospital.Because of inaccurate information 
provided by the AQMD, the story and the headline also said that Dillingham does 
not have a license to remove asbestos. The AQMD now says the company does have 
such a license. In addition, the story quoted an AQMD official as saying 
asbestos was found in debris from the main and south wings where Dillingham was 
working. The AQMD now says that no asbestos was found in the debris from either 
wing where Dillingham was working. Dillingham says none of its employees were 
exposed to asbestos. An AQMD official has clarified that asbestos was found in 
another wing, where Abatec Inc. was working. Abatec, which has been the 
asbestos removal contractor for the hospital for four years, says it has used 
the proper equipment and accepted abatement procedures in all its work.

1993-94 TIMES ALL-VENTURA COUNTY BOYS' BASKETBALL TEAM; COACH OF THE YEAR; 
CVIJANOVICH TAKES PRIDE IN AN OVERACHIEVING TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Santa Clara High's 1993-94 season was dwarfed by the career accomplishments of 
Coach Lou Cvijanovich. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not include one of his two state championships. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not include one of his 13 Southern Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not include a defeat in league play, but neither have 30 of his 36 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 It included 20 victories, but that merely is his career average. Cvijanovich, 
67, has racked up a mind-boggling record of 721-226, a .761 winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this season was among the most rewarding in Cvijanovich's illustrious 
career. The team practiced what their coach preaches -- tenacious defense, 
high-percentage shooting and pure hustle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good season because nobody expected us to get this far," Cvijanovich 
said after the Saints were eliminated from the Southern Regional Division IV 
state playoffs by San Diego Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 With one returning starter and no player taller than 6-foot-4, Santa Clara 
opened with a challenging nonleague schedule, and promptly lost seven of 13. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stiff competition paid off in the playoffs. After waltzing through the 
Frontier League with eight victories in a row, the Saints advanced to the 
Southern Section Division IV final. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Santa Clara upset No. 1-seeded Serra. After falling in the 
final to Verbum Dei, Santa Clara (20-9) defeated Bassett in the first round of 
the regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara's season lasted three weeks longer than that of any other county 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "These boys made me proud," Cvijanovich said. "This team achieved its 
maximum."
