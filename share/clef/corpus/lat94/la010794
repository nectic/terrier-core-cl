 Manson Controversy Sparks State Bill: Responding to controversy over the 
inclusion of a song by mass murder mastermind Charles Manson on the Guns N' 
Roses album "The Spaghetti Incident?," State Sen. Charles M. Calderon 
(D-Whittier) has introduced a bill that would prohibit convicted criminals from 
financially benefiting from their crimes. Although Manson's album royalties 
will go to the son of one of his victims under a court ruling, Calderon noted 
that Manson has received "thousands of dollars in royalties" from T-shirt 
sales. "The state should do everything possible to prevent criminals from 
earning money simply because they became famous from the commission of a 
heinous crime," Calderon said. The bill would expand the existing "Son of Sam 
Law," which places money from the sale of autobiographies or interviews in a 
trust fund for court-appointed beneficiaries, to include all proceeds collected 
as a direct or indirect result of notoriety from crime.

 * The Final Figures -- What Recession?: As predicted, 1993 turned out to be a 
banner year for the music industry with sales of albums and singles in the 
United States jumping to an estimated 683 million units -- a 4.3% increase over 
last year, according to year-end figures released by the New York research firm 
SoundScan. Thanks to an 8% surge in sales of compact discs, industry sources 
estimate that record companies last year grossed in the neighborhood of $9 
billion in domestic revenues. TELEVISION

 Shake-Up at ABC: Emily Rooney has been replaced as executive producer of ABC's 
"World News Tonight With Peter Jennings." Rick Kaplan, executive producer at 
the network's "PrimeTime Live," will take over the nightly newscast, while ABC 
producer Phyllis McGrady takes over "PrimeTime Live." Sources at ABC said 
Rooney, who joined ABC News in May, had alienated staffers with her management 
style. There was also said to be some concern about recent ratings gains by 
"NBC Nightly News." Rooney will be offered a new assignment at ABC News.

 * Wilson Draws Viewers: Bucking conventional wisdom that Southern California 
TV viewers aren't interested in state politics, about 555,000 households tuned 
in to the complete live coverage of Gov. Pete Wilson's State of the State 
speech Wednesday on KCBS-TV Channel 2 and KNBC-TV Channel 4. The combined 
ratings figures easily made it the most-watched program in the 5-5:30 p.m. 
slot, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co. By comparison, when Wilson's speech a 
year ago was carried only by KCAL-TV Channel 9, it drew only 139,000 households 
and was the lowest-rated program in its time slot.

 * The Return of Chuck: Chuck Henry, former veteran KABC-TV news anchor and 
"Eye on L.A." producer and host, has landed at KNBC-TV Channel 4 as an 
anchor-reporter. Henry, who has been reporting for the station all week, will 
begin co-anchoring the 4 p.m. weekday news next week with Carla Aragon, but his 
permanent anchoring assignment has yet to be determined.

 * More Animation for Kids: More Walt Disney-style animation is in store for 
kids, including two new weekly "theme days" set to be added to "The Disney 
Afternoon." Along with the already announced "Disney's Aladdin," a 65-episode 
daily program based on the 1992 theatrical feature, Disney plans "Monday 
Mania," featuring "The Shnookums & Meat Funny Cartoon Show," and "Action 
Friday," with the dramatic cartoon "Gargoyles." Disney's Buena Vista Television 
is spending more than $50 million on the three new series. "Disney's Aladdin" 
is set to premiere in September, followed by "Gargoyles" in October and 
"Shnookums & Meat" next January. PEOPLE WATCH

 Mickey Rourke Arrested: Actor Mickey Rourke was arrested outside his Miami 
Beach nightclub, Mickey's Place, early Thursday, after he reportedly yelled at 
some 75 people causing a stir outside his club and at officers who had come to 
quiet the ruckus. "Mr. Rourke appeared to be highly agitated, and was clenching 
his fist as he confronted others as well as the police officers at the scene," 
the police report said. Rourke, 39, spent a few hours behind bars before 
posting a $500 bond. If convicted on the misdemeanor charge of resisting an 
officer without violence, he could face up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

 NEA Starts Cutting: The National Endowment for the Arts is eliminating two of 
its programs -- the $150,000 Professional Theater Training Program and the 
$300,000 Dance Heritage Initiative -- and greatly scaling back grants to many 
other arts organizations to help cope with a $4.7-million reduction in the 
endowment's $174.5-million 1994-95 budget. The eliminated theater program 
benefited 16 of the nation's premier drama schools, while the dance program 
provided grants to help companies preserve dance productions on film and video 
tape. In an interview with the New York Times, Jane Alexander, the new NEA 
chairwoman, said: "It's highly regrettable, but we have to respond to the cuts 
that Congress handed to us. It's cutting into muscle, since it's been a long 
time since there was any fat to cut." A spokesman said the NEA expected to 
announce more cuts next week. SHAUNA SNOW

MOVIE REVIEW; 'CHINA II': HISTORY IN A MARTIAL ARTS FANTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tsui Hark's rousing "Once Upon a Time in China II" (at the Monica 4-Plex) is 
more a true sequel than most Hong Kong series pictures, which tend to be 
self-contained. You need to know going in that its hero, Wong Fei-Hong (again 
the boyish, personable Jet Lee), was an actual figure, a Canton physician and a 
proponent for Chinese independence who became a folk hero in the late 19th and 
early 20th centuries. You also need to know that the reason his lovely 
relative, his contemporary, but called Aunt Yee (Rosamund Kwan), dresses 
Western-style is because she has been a student in Britain. In short, it's a 
big help to have seen the first film in the ongoing series. 
</P>
<P>
 This qualification aside, "China II" is a terrific example of dealing with 
history within a martial arts fantasy context. It's 1895, a turbulent time in 
the rapidly waning Manchu dynasty. China has just lost Taiwan to Japan, and in 
Canton the ever-expanding mystical martial arts White Lotus sect declares its 
intent to free the poor, but concentrates on driving all foreigners out of 
China. Now the Chinese had plenty of reasons for wishing to do so after so many 
concessions had been granted to rapacious foreign nations, but Tsui Hark and 
his co-writers take a progressive view, condemning xenophobia for its own sake 
and realizing that it would be good for the nation to come to terms with the 
modern world. A century later the issues the film raises are still pertinent. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Wong Kei-Hong finds himself in the midst of escalating 
strife. He, Aunt Yee and his manservant Leung Fu (Max Mok) are determined to 
save a group of schoolchildren whose foreign-language school has been burnt to 
the ground by the White Lotus; meanwhile, Wong meets none other than Sun 
Yat-Sen and lends his support for Sun's cause in overthrowing the decadent 
monarchy and turning China into a republic. Although he is eventually cast as 
the bad guy, you really do have to have some sympathy for Kung (Hung Yin-Yin), 
Canton's military commander, who simultaneously is charged with protecting the 
foreigners, curbing the White Lotus and repressing Sun's rebel movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsui Hark directs with his customary verve, and the martial arts battles are 
suitably spectacular. "Once Upon a Time in China II," however, is perhaps most 
notable for the way in which the director and his greatly gifted 
cinematographer, Arthur Wong, mask an overly modest budget -- various Victorian 
interiors are definitely dime-store -- with a dramatic play of light and shadow 
and a crisp sense of composition. "China II" is a blithe, often humorous action 
entertainment that nevertheless manages to illuminate a crucial period in 
China's history.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'THE AIR UP THERE' IS PRETTY THIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story of an American college coach's attempt to recruit a taller-than-tall 
African basketball player, "The Air Up There" (citywide) may be the first movie 
to be high concept both literally and metaphorically. But that doesn't mean 
it's going to make anybody happy. 
</P>
<P>
 A feeble and simplistic attempt at an adventure comedy, "Air" is a movie that 
never should have been let out of development hell. In truth, it probably snuck 
out, because nothing about it is as well-developed as Charles Gitonga Maina, 
the 6-foot-10 Kenyan who stars as Saleh, the object of that coach's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach is Jimmy Dolan (Kevin Bacon), a hard-driving assistant at mythical 
St. Joseph's. Once known as "the mouth that scored," Dolan is a former hot-shot 
college player considered too self-centered to be head coaching material. If 
you think all that is about to change, you're way ahead of this game. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to work his way out of the doghouse, Dolan gets the cracked idea of 
going to Kenya to sign up a tower of power "with the hang time of a hot-air 
balloon" he glimpses in the background of a video about missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 That turns out to be Saleh, an affable young man (pleasantly played by Maina) 
who would like nothing better than matriculating in the states. However, his 
father (veteran South African actor Winston Ntshona) has other plans for him at 
home, and Dolan's slick recruiter's attitude is so obnoxious even a saintly nun 
(Yolanda Vazquez) breaks down and calls him "a sports pimp." Will the coach 
have to go home empty-handed? Guess again.  
</P>
<P>
 The inspiration, if that is the right word, for "The Air Up There" is the 
careers of such transplanted-to-the-NBA stars as Nigeria's Hakeem Olajuwon and 
the Sudan's Manute Bol. Novelist Max Apple got the idea and is credited with 
the screenplay, though its high percentage of bathroom jokes leads one to 
suspect that a committee of 10-year-old boys really did the work. 
</P>
<P>
 If Apple was the screenwriter, he must have come up with the plot after holing 
up for the weekend with a gross of videos, for "The Air" (blandly directed by 
Paul M. Glaser) is jammed with as many narrative cliches as its hour and 46 
minutes will allow. 
</P>
<P>
 And though the production went to the trouble of shooting in Africa and using 
Kenya's Samburu tribe as the inspiration for the film's fictional Winabi, its 
treatment of Africans is so cartoonish it might as well have been shot on some 
back lot. And of course the real purpose of having Africans in this film at all 
is to enable a pale face to mature and shine. Some things never do seem to 
change.

THEATER REVIEW; 'HUMILIATING STORIES' TOLD HUMOROUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Lisa Kron's deft solo, "101 Humiliating Stories," at Highways, a sanitary 
pad lies stranded in a junior high school corridor, and the girl who dropped it 
tries valiantly to disown it. Cooties cause a wave of thousands of passers-by 
to part like the Red Sea, as our heroine recoils. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash forward, and the girl's a woman, sent on a work errand to pick up petty 
cash from the bank. On the way back, she's sidetracked into Macy's. And when 
the makeup counter won't take Visa, she plops down the office dough. 
</P>
<P>
 Later at another job, our lady of the faux pas strolls past co-workers, 
unaware that her skirt is stuck in her tights. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoopsie . We're in the land of the dreaded Awkward Moment. And, while it's 
not a friendly place for the doofs and dorks of the world, it's terrain that 
the slyly dissembling Kron farms with rare virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, what's a Big Lesbian to do when she's got to face her 10th annual 
high school class reunion in Lansing? Four versions of what Kron imagines she 
might have said -- ranging from stridently out of the closet to sheepishly 
apologetic -- punctuate this autobiographical solo, but they're the tamest 
parts of an often raucous ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaving together themes of sexual identity, social convention and 
anti-nostalgia, "101 Humiliating Stories" is a hoot with a point. Journey with 
Kron through her 1975 gym class, three "geeky celebrity encounters" or "the 
Laura Ingalls Wilder debacle," for instance, and you'll hear familiar tales of 
self-consciousness tinged with social critique. 
</P>
<P>
 A paper chain of personal anecdotes that's both astutely written and 
skillfully performed, Kron's solo combines the belly laughs of comedy with the 
poignancy of better solo performance. Because she's not confined to stand-up's 
punch-line pace, she can draw a story out for dramatic effect, demonstrating 
that humor and depth needn't be mutually exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the woman you want to be next to at a cocktail party when you need 
someone else to do the chatting. She's wry but she's also a mensch. "I know the 
high school segments can be resonant," says Kron, temporarily interrupting her 
harrowing accounts of green polyester gym suits and "nerdy blue knee highs." 
"So, um, I'm gonna check in periodically . . . and make sure everybody's OK . . 
. If you have feelings that come up . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The writing is economical without being too spare, and Kron takes her time 
delivering it. That, combined with her relaxed stage persona, creates a casual 
fluency rarely matched in this genre. The sure-footed show may feel as though 
it's off the cuff, but you suspect that every "um" or "uh" is scripted. 
</P>
<P>
 Kron, who's part of the comedy group the Five Lesbian Brothers, is also a 
master of the on-purpose accident. Although she plays clumsy, she has a knack 
for physical comedy. When she nods off, drops her notes or careens into the 
music stand, you actually wonder for a nanosecond whether the boo-boos are bona 
fide or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Only her junior high gym teacher knows for sure. 
</P>
<P>

MOVIE REVIEW; 'CABIN BOY' GETS STRANDED ON COMEDIC SHOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From three-minute bits on "Late Night" to half-hours of "Get a Life" to -- now 
-- the big screen, Chris Elliott has developed a pretty singular, if slippery, 
comic persona. He's always inviting you to laugh with him and then at him, 
taking down the high and mighty while deserving a good tackle himself, 
alternately a provider and object of extreme condescension in almost the same 
beat. This fey, unctuous dolt deserves -- and probably could carry -- a good, 
deliriously perverse movie farce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cabin Boy" (citywide) isn't it, not by a nautical mile. It's another 
cross-demographic picture that seems destined to bypass all demographics. 
There's a lot of juvenalia already built into Elliott's character, for sure, 
but his grown-up ironic sense gets dumbed down a little too much in the effort 
to make the movie a palatable kid-flick. In this climate you might appreciate 
the pains the film takes to avoid the profane, but Elliott's a master of black 
comedy, and this film desperately needs a little soot on its soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott and writer-director Adam Resnick do at least generate enough good will 
with the bemusement of their concept to set sail for a while. Their farce is 
designed as a cross between vintage boy-at-sea adventures like "Captains 
Courageous" and the stop-motion fantasy of Ray Harryhausen's "Sinbad" and 
"Jason" pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The "boy" coming of age here is Elliott, as spoiled-rotten Nathanial 
Mayweather, who sets off from a continental finishing school to rejoin daddy in 
the States. The ship he mistakenly steps onto isn't the Queen Elizabeth, of 
course, but rather the Filthy Whore, a fishing vessel full of gruff character 
actors. At first they're ready to pull a Jonah on this pampered stowaway, but 
all must band together when they run into adversaries like a fearsome iceberg 
and an island giant with a pocket protector. 
</P>
<P>
 The vividly colorful, set-bound set design (by Stephen Alescgh) and art 
direction (Nanci B. Roberts, Daniel A. Lomino) cleverly establish "Cabin Boy" 
as parody, for those who care to recognize it. And at least the screenplay 
doesn't resort to references to other movies for its laughs. The problem is 
that it doesn't find a lot of laughs in much of anything, referential or 
otherwise. Resnick's script plays like a first draft rushed into production 
before most of the gags got penned in, or before anyone decided who they should 
be targeted at. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott does have some very amusing bits of ridiculousness -- literally 
licking the deck clean, or doing a quadruple-take underwater. Current Conan 
O'Brien sidekick Andy Richter gets washed overboard before too long, but in the 
early going enjoys a few amiably imbecilic moments as a doofus involved in 
Elliott's shipside misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's another "Late Night"-er who steals the movie. David Letterman pops up 
for a couple of unbilled minutes as a denizen of the dockside village Elliott 
visits pre-voyage, and he cackles his way through the entire scene, patronizing 
the befuddled star as hilariously as he used to in the NBC days of yore. This 
marks the first screen work Disney has gotten out of the talk-show host since 
making that multimillion-dollar movie deal with him some years back; he so 
lights up the screen in his brief time he makes you hope they talk him into a 
Letterman-and-Elliott feature, though breath-holding isn't advised.

TV REVIEW; 'REPORTS' LOOKS AT PLAYERS IN TV-TRIAL JUNGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The media giveth, and the media taketh away -- especially when it covers 
sensational trials. In another entry in the growing genre of the media covering 
itself, "Trial by Television," on the A&E channel's "Investigative Reports" 
series at 10 tonight, offers a quick gloss on the horrendously difficult issue 
of how First Amendment rights can be balanced with the right to a fair jury 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 What producers Caroline Sommers' and Paul Gallagher's report lacks in depth it 
nearly makes up for in coverage. There are the grieving mothers of media-trial 
victims: Ellen Levin, mother of murdered Jennifer Levin, and Linda Wojas, 
mother of Pam Smart, convicted of murder conspiracy. There are the various 
attorneys of all stripes, from potent First Amendment advocate Alan Dershowitz 
and perennial defense attorney William Kunstler to hustling counsel David 
Lewis. There are the judges, like John A. K. Bradley of New York, who condemn 
cameras in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there are the media stars, from New Hampshire TV reporter Bill 
Spenser, who starred as himself in the TV movie of the Smart case, to Fred 
Graham, anchor for Court TV, which brings the courtroom into your living room 
(that is, if you have the right cable carrier). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly everyone here defends their role in the trial-TV jungle, and sometimes 
they get bitten in their defense. Graham amusedly notes how Lewis, so quick to 
condemn media influence in the courtroom, has served as a Court TV commentator; 
Dershowitz deflates Bradley's gripes about cameras in court by remarking that 
the judge was a big "ham" on TV during the Leona Helmsley case. 
</P>
<P>
 Dershowitz provides the one useful suggestion during the hour of cross-debate: 
Place a camera in an enclosed booth with a two-way mirror in every American 
courtroom so the judge, jury, lawyers and witnesses never know when it is on.  
</P>
<P>
 This, however, would have no effect on the sensationalist pretrial coverage by 
TV news crews sniffing down good footage for the evening broadcast: It's this 
bloodhound mentality that Wojas insists prevented her daughter from having a 
fair trial. The only thing to do about it, as media critic Edwin Diamond 
correctly says, is to complain about coverage -- not to censor it. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's dramatically wrong with "Trial by Television" isn't its central 
theme, but its East Coast bias. Even though it was made in advance of the 
Menendez case and the Michael Jackson affair, the report might have used any 
number of media-affected trials in Los Angeles, arguably the world capital of 
sensational cases. Kurtis' brief closing comment on the Rodney G. King beating 
trial hardly sums up the enormous influence that coverage of that case had on 
L.A. residents -- including those who started rioting hours after the Simi 
Valley verdict.

JAZZ REVIEWS; ERIC REED'S COMPELLING PIANISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eric Reed, the 23-year-old pianist who has earned valuable exposure with the 
Wynton Marsalis group, was at the Brasserie of the Bel Age Hotel Tuesday and 
Wednesday leading his own trio. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed's knowledge of the roots of jazz enables him to skip decades with 
consummate ease, applying his technical finesse to everything from the 
traditional "Wade in the Water" to popular and jazz standards and an occasional 
original. 
</P>
<P>
 His own "Never Say Never" established the engagingly unified personality of 
the trio, with Willie Jones III on drums and the exceptional John Clayton Jr. 
on bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "You Don't Know What Love Is," a 1941 ballad, brought out dual moods, romantic 
and assertive, in Reed, along with an arco contribution by Clayton. Bobby 
Watson's "E.T.A." found the threesome in a more contemporary mode. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed may not yet have found his own firm identity as a stylist, but in his 
more inventive moments he shows strong potential. His best offering by far was 
"Every Time We Say Goodbye," a 1940s love song that he developed brilliantly, 
enriching its already opulent harmonic lines, then doubling the beat as the 
intensity built. Following a Clayton chorus, Reed returned to the original mood 
and tempo for a well-conceived finale. LEONARD FEATHER

JAZZ REVIEWS; HORACE SILVER MAKES HEALTHY COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since introducing his enlarged Silver Brass Ensemble a year ago at Catalina 
Bar & Grill, pianist Horace Silver made a successful album, but a serious 
illness prevented him from touring to promote it. Tuesday night he brought the 
same group back to the Hollywood club for an engagement that continues through 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver's return to good health and to the club scene is welcome news to the 
jazz community. 
</P>
<P>
 A prolific composer, Silver, who made his debut as a leader four decades ago, 
basically writes melodic statements arranged for his six-piece brass section 
(three trumpets, French horn and two trombones). The blend he achieves with 
this instrumentation is one of three reasons for the group's attractive 
personality. The others are Silver at the piano, jaggedly sharp in his 
rhythmically propulsive statements, and Red Holloway, whose tenor sax solos are 
invariably delivered with fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver hasn't rejected his earlier values. One tune, "Blues for Brother Blue," 
was named for Blue Mitchell, a sideman in one of his quintets. Another was a 
revamped arrangement of his 1958 hit "Senor Blues."  
</P>
<P>
 Except for a couple of solos by George Bohanon on trombone and one by Ron 
Stout on trumpet, the brass members worked mainly as a unit, backed by a rhythm 
team to which drummer Carl Burnett and bassist Bob Maize were steady and sturdy 
contributors. LEONARD FEATHER

POP ALBUM CHART; SNOOP IS TOPP DOGG AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The No. 1 position on the pop album chart has been nicknamed the Dogg 
House--in honor of Snoop Doggy Dogg's frequent residence. He's back "home" 
again, with his "Doggystyle" reclaiming the top spot.Many Jodeci fans are now 
finding out that the vocal group has a new album. Some didn't notice when 
"Diary of a Mad Band" came out the week before Christmas. But the album is now 
picking up steam, zooming from No. 27 to No. 8 in its second week on the chart. 
Two Top 10 albums, Tom Petty's "Greatest Hits" (No. 9) and Aerosmith's "Get a 
Grip" (No. 10), probably will drop out of the elite circle next week. Both 
climbed in recent weeks because they were popular Christmas gift items. Mariah 
Carey's "Hero" is still the top pop single. 
</P>
<P>
 * Smashing Pumpkins' acclaimed summer release "Siamese Dream," which got as 
high as No. 10, is on the rise again, as the album continues to pick up new 
fans. It jumped from No. 22 to No. 17. 04,28,06,08,08 Rank Rank 2 Weeks Last

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: AL GREEN'S COMPELLING 'RIGHT STUFF' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most satisfying and usually most economical way to survey an artist's 
career is a box set, but what happens when an artist whose music you want 
doesn't have one out? 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Al Green, the most compelling of all post-'60s soul singers, 
you can turn to some greatest-hits packages or -- better yet -- his original 
albums, the first four of which have been released on CD by Capitol Records as 
part of its "The Right Stuff" mid-line budget series. 
</P>
<P>
 The albums, which carry an $11.98 list price, include the artwork and music 
from Green's original Hi Records albums, plus new liner notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry when you look at the backs of the albums and see a lot of song 
titles that are either unfamiliar or that are associated with other artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the song is the Bee Gees' "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart" or a tune 
that's new to you, Green's interpretation generally offers the sensual tension 
and dramatic intimacy that characterizes his most celebrated hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Forrest City, Ark., in 1946, Green (his real name is Greene) began 
singing in a gospel quartet when he was still in his early teens. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Memphis record producer Willie Mitchell spotted him singing in a 
Texas club in 1968, Green had switched to secular music and had registered a 
Top 50 hit, "Back Up Train," on tiny Hot Line Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell took Green to Memphis where he signed with Hi Records and began 
working with the Hi house band, which ranks with the great Stax/Volt session 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Green Is Blues," his first Hi album, didn't generate any hits, but it offers 
a rewarding chronicle of a young singer trying to find a comfortable style. The 
eclectic material on the 1970 package ranges from Jerry Butler's "I Stand 
Accused" and Lennon-McCartney's "Get Back" to Heyward-Gershwin's "Summertime." 
</P>
<P>
 "Al Green Gets Next to You," which followed in 1971, is a more confident and 
commanding work in which Green goes the Temptations one step further in his 
rendition of "I Can't Get Next to You" and then marches to stardom with one of 
the great soul singles ever: "Tired of Being Alone." The weak moment: an 
unconvincing version of the Doors' "Light My Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Green's "Let's Stay Together" was released in 1972, the young 
singer was widely heralded as the successor to Sam Cooke and Otis Redding's 
soul crown. The album's title song went to No. 1 on the pop and R&B charts. 
</P>
<P>
 The title track from Green's other 1972 album, "I'm Still in Love With You," 
was also a Top 10 hit, and it was backed by another group of well-chosen and 
marvelously performed songs, including Kris Kristofferson's "For the Good 
Times." 
</P>
<P>
 Green, an ordained minister who has spent most of his time since the late '70s 
in gospel music, remains one of the great voices in modern pop. He returned to 
the pop charts in 1988 with his duet with Annie Lennox on "Put a Little Love in 
Your Heart," and teams with Lyle Lovett on Willie Nelson's "Funny How Time 
Slips Away" on a soul-meets-country collection of duets that will be released 
this spring by MCA Records.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; SIMPLE FARE THE BEST BET AT THE BB&G 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Broadway Bar & Grill on the 3rd Street Promenade is the type of place that 
we Americans, raised on Archie Bunker and weaned on "Cheers," number among our 
basic human rights. Housed in one of Santa Monica's oldest brick buildings, 
this classic San Francisco-style eating and drinking establishment has been 
around five years -- it survived the block's conversion to a walking mall and 
continues to do a steady, respectable trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any serious bar and grill, the place is filled with dark wood, dark 
booths for privacy, dark partitions between bar and restaurant. Especially 
charming are the tiny tables in the bar: They're just big enough for drinks and 
elbows, the perfect setting for an intense conversation on the virtues of 
hockey. The bar itself is a substantial vintage relic uprooted from another, 
older, authentic bar back East. Televisions are tuned to sporting events. One 
learns, after a while, not to faint each time the bar crowd roars at a 
particularly galling interception or tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all its classic touches, one could say the place has been kissed by 
contemporary ideas of bar and grilldom. In addition to chops and fish and 
chips, there's pasta and salads made with baby lettuce on the menu, as well as 
a number of post-modern architectonics such as faux-marbled pillars, a false 
ceiling and kleig lights. There's also a small, fenced-in patio outside on the 
Promenade, where you can sit under awnings and watch the topiary triceratops 
spit water into a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekend nights, the bar burgeons with a lively, young singles scene but the 
dining room stays persistently democratic in terms of age, gender, personal 
style. The couple next to us are cheery octogenarians -- the tortilla soup's a 
little spicy for them, they say. The young couple on the other side of us are 
home for the holidays from their colleges back East. New Year's Day, a large 
family of red-shirted Badgers arrive, triumphant, for dinner; they're subjected 
to only the lightest good-natured ribbing. Besides, the bar crowd is already 
engrossed in another bowl -- the Orange, the Sugar, it matters not. 
</P>
<P>
 When ordering, it seems wise to stick with simpler, standard bar and grill 
fare. The simpler the salad, for example, the better: nothing wrong with the 
mixed baby greens, or the mixed baby greens with blue cheese and toasted 
hazelnuts. The grilled chicken salad with sunflower sprouts and crispy 
thread-like potatoes has its pleasures. But order the endive salad with pear 
and Stilton cheese and the kitchen is over its head: It's the standard mixed 
baby greens with a few slices of rock-hard pear and four meager spears of 
Belgian endive. 
</P>
<P>
 On a chilly day, acorn soup sounds perfect -- and would be if only it were, 
well, soupy; instead, we have a bowlful of tasty, fluffy squash puree that, 
like egg whites, forms stiff peaks.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steamed whole Louisiana shrimp are the most expensive appetizer and the most 
hard work. I had to clean the shrimp myself -- pull off heads and skins, devein 
them -- a process that endeared neither me nor the perfectly fine finished 
shrimp to my squeamish dinner companion (not a dish to order on a first date). 
Golden calamari fritti , the bar and grill food of the '90s, while curiously 
uncrisp, comes with a delicious ancho chile mayonnaise. Grilled vegetable 
skewers are wonderful, and too small. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore chicken breasts, with a rich nut crust and a sweet honey mustard 
sauce, are pretty terrible, but a basic, unadorned corned beef and bright-green 
cabbage is a perfectly workable meal. The Broadway burger tastes like a burger 
you'd make at home: It's juicy, on a crusty French roll with a slice of 
dead-ripe tomato, and comes with very ordinary fries. 
</P>
<P>
 Crab cakes are fresher and crabbier than many around. Fish and chips suffer 
from the same dullish fries as the burger and a vinegar absolutely lacking in 
any bite.  
</P>
<P>
 BB&G servers are cheerful but harried; the place seems perpetually 
short-staffed. Service itself tends to be minimal, sometimes bordering on 
neglectful. You get seated, you get your food, eventually you get your check. 
That's about it. As we wait for our dinner plates to be cleared, our urge for 
dessert gradually is replaced by the urge to pay the check and go. 
</P>
<P>
 * Broadway Bar & Grill, 1460 3rd Street Promenade, Santa Monica, (310) 
393-4211. Open 7 days for lunch and dinner. (Brunch on Sundays.) Full bar.

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; 'CLIFFHANGER' HANGS ON TO THE TOP 
</P>

 "Cliffhanger" continues to hang tough at the top of the rental chart, fending 
off the hot holiday releases. But it may finally lose its grip on the top spot 
next week, with "Sleepless in Seattle" (No. 4) and "The Firm," which premiered 
at No. 6, the most likely new chart leaders.Both are doing bang-up business, 
particularly "The Firm," the thriller starring Tom Cruise that grossed a 
whopping $157 million in theaters. But in listing the candidates for No. 1, 
don't rule out "Rising Sun," which quietly rose another rung to No. 2. It's not 
quite as high profile as "Sleepless" or "The Firm"--and didn't make nearly as 
much money--but it's the kind of big-star (Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes), 
lurid thriller that usually does well in the rental market. "Guilty as Sin," 
the drama starring Don Johnson, moved up a notch to No. 10 and may climb a bit 
higher.  
</P>
<P>
 * "Dave," the comedy starring Kevin Kline as a presidential look-alike, racked 
up a hefty $61-million theatrical gross and may soon rule the rental market. 
Some retailers are already reporting that it's their top rental, though it only 
entered the chart at No. 14. Look for it to jump into the Top 5 next week.

MUSIC REVIEW; UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF 'PLANETS' ENHANCES PICTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pacific Symphony concert Wednesday at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center was an interesting hybrid that forces consideration under a different 
kind of rubric than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half was pure music, with Christopher Seaman leading the orchestra 
in Berlioz's "Roman Carnival" Overture and Tchaikovsky's "Rococo" Variations, 
with cellist Bion Tsang as soloist. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing new there, although Seaman worked some real magic, given the major 
handicap he was handed: About 20 regular section leaders and others are touring 
Japan as members of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Tsang -- pardon the pun -- sang with small-scaled but fervent 
eloquence. 
</P>
<P>
 The new breed came after intermission, as Seaman led Holst's "The Planets" to 
a visual adaptation by Marc Jacobs, a British-born stage director who has lived 
in Los Angeles for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs' contribution consisted of some 450 slides sequentially projected onto 
two 9-by-12-foot screens (one horizontal, one vertical) that floated above each 
side of the orchestra. Rarely did the same pictures, taken from NASA satellites 
or just from Life magazine-type portfolios, appear on both screens at the same 
time or with the same pacing. 
</P>
<P>
 In concept and execution, the results proved neither simplistic nor 
inevitable, though occasionally predictable. The images did not often 
illuminate the music, but the music did enhance the pictures, which had both 
intrinsic and cumulative impact. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Mars, The Bringer of War," the images ranged from the fall of Troy to 
Hitler and the Nazis to Vietnam and the post-Vietnam era and led to a buildup 
of Swiftian nausea and disgust that was alleviated only three sections later, 
in the smiles of ordinary people, the newspaper headlines of Peace in Europe, 
the picture of Louis Armstrong playing trumpet -- all in "Jupiter, the Bringer 
of Jollity." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, however, because of the stage lighting, the slides could not be 
clearly seen nor understood. Sometimes the connections to the music appeared 
arbitrary, dubious or weird. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, Seaman conducted the difficult score with self-effacing, 
no-nonsense, straightforward control, enhancing the impression that the music 
was an accompaniment to the visuals rather than the other way around or even in 
equal partnership with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he got the orchestra to play consistently with point and musical 
purpose, and, even if there was a sense of strain and reaching, it was reaching 
in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The excellent offstage chorus consisted of the women of the Pacific Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
 To open the program, Seaman, who was once a candidate for the music director 
position and twice before a guest conductor with this orchestra, led a tight, 
intelligent account of the Berlioz overture. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a Giovanni Grancino cello made in Milan in 1705, Tsang, 25, proved an 
honest, committed soloist, forcing neither the tone, the music, nor his 
Tchaikovsky interpretation.

HOME TECH / VIDEO: TV/VCR COMBOS HIT WITH PUBLIC, RETAILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to see an electronics retailer's eyes light up? Just mention TV/VCR 
combination units. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers love the hot-selling hybrids of a TV and a VCR. The sales figures, 
from the Electronic Industries Assn., tell the story. The number of TV/VCR 
combinations shipped to retailers has jumped, from 600,000 in 1991 to 950,000 
in 1992. Last year's figures aren't in yet, but the projection was a growth of 
55% over 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the markets for other video products aren't growing nearly as fast, new 
companies continue to board the TV/VCR bandwagon. For instance, at the Consumer 
Electronics Show that opened Thursday in Las Vegas, Aiwa America is introducing 
13- and 20-inch models. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Calabrese, vice president of marketing at Emerson, a major player in 
the market since these combinations surfaced in 1988, said, "A television with 
VCR already built in is attractive to consumers who don't like to set up 
electronics equipment. These combinations also are great space-savers."  
</P>
<P>
 Generally the TV/VCRs don't have many frills and are limited to mid-size and 
smaller screens. Emerson has three models -- 9-, 13- and 19-inch -- and none 
are available with stereo. "When you think of stereo you think of big screens," 
Calabrese pointed out. "This isn't a product that's suited to larger screen 
sizes. It might make some sense to have stereo in a 19- or 20-inch combination 
unit, but there's not that much consumer interest." 
</P>
<P>
 The big drawback to these units is price. For instance, Emerson's cheapest 
unit is the 13-inch (VT1322), which retails for $650. Its 19-inch (VT1922) is 
$750. In many cases it's cheaper to buy a TV and a VCR separately. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the hurdles in this market," Calabrese explained. "Production 
complexities create that price. That's another problem with big-screen TV/VCR 
units. As the screen size gets close to 30 inches, the cost gets to be too high 
to interest most consumers. But none of these hurdles is hurting the market 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Bring on the Stooges 
</P>

 Attention, Three Stooges fanatics: Mark Feb. 16 on your calendar -- that's 
when Columbia TriStar will release eight new-to-video collections, celebrating 
the 60th anniversary of the zany trio. Each tape, running about 50 minutes, 
includes three short films and will sell for $15. 
</P>
<P>
 True Stooge fans are wild about the Moe-Larry-Curly movies and steer clear of 
any featuring Shemp instead of Curly. The best of the packages: "So Long 
Chumps," including "Even as I.O.U" (1941), set in a race track, highlighted by 
Curly's encounters with a talking horse. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape titled "A Plumbing We Will Go" is even better, featuring "Violent Is 
the Word for Curly" (1938) and "Punch Drunks" (1934), arguably Curly's funniest 
movie. In this one, he's a boxer who goes berserk when he hears the "Pop Goes 
the Weasel" melody. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot Shots! Part Deux" (FoxVideo, no set price). In the loony tradition of the 
"Airplane" and "Naked Gun" parody series, this one, spoofing "Rambo" movies, 
sprays jokes scattergun-style. Many are well wide of the mark, but some are 
hilariously on target. Worth wading through the silliness for the few gems. 
Charlie Sheen stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "True Romance" (Warner, no set price). Often intriguing, excessively violent, 
fairly original movie, directed by Tony Scott, about newlyweds (Christian 
Slater and Patricia Arquette) on the run from mobsters searching for a fortune 
in cocaine. What really keeps this offbeat movie interesting is all the 
brilliant supporting performances -- especially those by Dennis Hopper and 
Christopher Walken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hocus Pocus" (Buena Vista, no set price). What is Bette Midler doing in this 
mindless kid-oriented mess of a comedy? It's beneath her talents and those of 
co-stars Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker, too. In the free-wheeling style 
of the Three Stooges, the trio play wacky witches who prey on youngsters on 
Halloween. Kids 10-and-under may get a kick out of the actresses' mugging and 
the special effects. For real Midler fans, though, it's painful to watch.

 RIGHT SOUND: When director Oliver Stone made "Heaven and Earth," about the 
wartime experience of a young Vietnamese woman -- now playing county-wide -- he 
knew that a good part of its audience would be Vietnamese Americans. So he had 
a version dubbed into the Vietnamese language. . . . The only theater around 
showing that version is the Thu Do Cinema in Little Saigon. Officials say it's 
doing well there. Much of the audience is older Vietnamese who speak little or 
no English.

 DON'T STOP PAYING: If you live in Garden Grove and want to add a stop sign on 
your street, you'll probably have to pay for it from now on. The city decided 
this week to pay for stop signs only where the need is severe. If you want one 
just for better traffic control, your neighborhood has to pay. . . . A set of 
four-way stop signs: $1,000. A two-way set: $500. City Councilman Robert F. 
Dinsen begrudgingly approved the plan, but complained it was more of 
"government digging deeper into the pockets of taxpayers."

 HOT SPOT: The annual eight-day Sports, Vacation and RV show, which opens at 
the Anaheim Convention Center on Saturday, is a chance to shop for dream 
vacation spots. But new to this year's show: a kick-off celebration of Smokey 
Bear's 50th birthday. His slogan, "Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires," is so 
famous that now he often just says "Only You." Look for him at the New Mexico 
booth: the state is plugging its Smokey Bear State Park.

 HALEY'S COMET: National Republican chairman Haley Barbour is making the rounds 
in California this week to prepare for the '94 elections. Tonight's stop: Le 
Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach, for a dinner address to the Orange County 
Lincoln Club, made up of party leaders and contributors. . . . "It's a chance 
for him to mix and mingle with the troops and whip up some enthusiasm for the 
next election," says local party spokesman Bill Christiansen.

 His film career began with the 1936 film "Hats Off," which he choreographed 
and ended with "The Young Runaways" which he directed in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, he handled such films as "Boston Blackie Booked on Suspicion" and

CHARLES SCHOTT; W W II FLIER, AVIATION EXECUTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Wesley Schott, 87, retired Air Force major general and aerospace 
executive who was a decorated bomber command pilot during World War II, has 
died. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
 His family said Monday that Schott died Dec. 27 at Air Force Village West 
Health Center in Riverside where he had lived for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Providence, R.I., Schott was educated at Brown University and the 
University of Michigan. He entered the Air Corps as a flying cadet in 1930 and 
served for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight years in civilian life with American Airways and in air traffic 
control, Schott was called to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent most of World War II flying combat planes in England and Europe, and 
once accomplished the surrender of a German garrison near the abandoned German 
airfield where he landed -- before Allied troops had crossed the Rhine. 
</P>
<P>
 Schott earned the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit with two Oak Leaf Clusters, 
and the Croix de Guerre with Palm from France, Belgium and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1950s, Schott served as a commander with the Strategic Air Command, 
stationed at Walker Air Force Base in New Mexico, and later in Guam. He retired 
in 1963 as deputy inspector general of the Air Force, stationed at Norton Air 
Force Base near Redlands, after 32 years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Schott later served as a director of North American Aviation and continued as 
a management systems executive and consultant with its successor, Rockwell 
International, for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Barbara Crittenden Schott of Riverside; a son, 
Kenneth C. Schott of Annandale, Va., and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the AFVW Health 
Center, 17050 Arnold Drive, Riverside, Calif. 92518.

A GIFT FOR GORE; AT 15, MAKEUP ARTIST JOSH BREZNER HAS CREDITS IN MORE THAN 30 
MOSTLY SCARY PRODUCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; John Morell is a regular contributor to 
The Times.

<P>
 For most kids, seeing one of the gory, horrific "Nightmare on Elm Street" 
movies means going to bed with the light on for several months. But for Josh 
Brezner of Granada Hills, all that big-screen murder and mayhem was an 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 He got some clay and began trying to re-create some of the effects, in 
particular a scene where a woman turns into a cockroach. "I was 10 and I had 
never seen anything like that before. It was fantastic. That got me started 
into effects and makeup, and it hasn't been boring yet," Josh says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 15 and a sophomore at Van Nuys High School's production magnet, Josh makes 
his friends jealous when he talks about his weekend and after-school jobs. He 
has credits in more than 30 productions, including student films, music videos 
and a Hollywood play. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm at a screening of a film I've worked on and the crowd moans when 
they see an effect I've created, it's a rush. It's even better on a set when 
I've made a wound and the people around me know it's fake, and they still turn 
away. I want to say, 'Thank you,' " Josh says. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits his early success to his parents' approval of his creative energy. 
"From early on he's been interested in special effects, and we've encouraged 
him," says Michelle Brezner, his mother. Josh's parents have become accustomed 
to driving him to and from early-morning shoots. "This is something he's good 
at and he loves, so we do what we can for him," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching Josh try to duplicate the cockroach, Michelle Brezner called 
UCLA to see if there were any extension courses for children who wanted to 
learn about movie special effects. The effects classes were for adults only, 
but teacher Marilyn White was impressed by Josh's creativity and got him a job 
cleaning up at Cinema Secrets, a Burbank store that sells makeup and special 
effects equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh took the prosthetics and creature effects classes offered at the store, 
then began assisting on shoots, helping to create scars and wounds. "I was 11 
when I worked my first set, assisting Marilyn on a movie. It was a little 
scary, I didn't know what to expect. But everyone was nice, and it was cool to 
be so young and these adults were treating me like an adult. It blew me away." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he began getting calls from student directors needing some nasty scars on 
their actors and earned his first solo credit for the film "Tonto Tiempo" 
(1991). The work for film schools doesn't pay much, often just his lunch and 
expenses, but Josh meticulously keeps videotapes of his work for his growing 
portfolio. "I'm not sure yet what I'll do right after high school, but I 
definitely want to be involved in this," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the names of some of the student films Josh has worked on, such as "Rigor 
Mortis" and "The Tar Monster," both made in 1993, suggest these could be great 
showcases for his talent. Fortunately for him, there aren't many E.M. Forster 
adaptations made in film school. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Brain Drain' was definitely the toughest movie I've worked on," he says of 
another 1993 project. "The director wanted nonstop effects. It was the first 
time I was absolutely essential to the production. If I didn't show up, they 
couldn't film." 
</P>
<P>
 His challenge was to rig up a plumbing system that dripped liquid from the 
heads of 20 extras -- i.e., the "Brain Drain." "I had to find a way to make 
this work and was able to get a plumbing prosthetic that dripped and looked 
realistic. They say you learn something new on every shoot, and it's true," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 After being called for a job, Josh reviews the script and goes over the 
effects with the director. "I want to find out what the director's vision is, 
what he sees for the effects. Sometimes he has specific ideas of how he wants a 
monster to look or how a wound should be, other times he'll leave it up to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other kids his age, Josh spends time in the library, but not doing book 
reports. While coming up with ideas for effects, you can find him in the dark 
shelves surrounding medical and forensic pathology books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll look for pictures of rashes, burns, gunshot wounds. You have to know 
what these things look like in order to make them realistic," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 While Josh prides himself on the realism of his effects and makeup jobs, 
there's one effect that eludes him. "It's virtually impossible to make 
realistic blood," he says. When you prick your finger and watch the blood come 
out, you can see how it moves, it almost seems alive. That just can't be 
duplicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Actors aren't always easy to work with, especially when a guy who doesn't have 
his driver's license yet is trying to get you to hold still until your scarred 
body dries. "In the classes I took I had a lot of effects done to myself so I 
know what it feels like. A lot of people don't like to have any makeup or 
chemicals put near their eyes and I try to work with that. I'll tell the actor 
what I'm doing, what I'm using, just make him feel comfortable," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent music video, Josh made his acting debut. "Queenie," by the group 
Ethyl Meatplow, features a bizarre dream sequence in which a jazz quartet plays 
for an unusual group of dancers. In the background, the bass player with the 
slicked-back hair hams it up. "It was a little strange being in front of the 
camera. I was there just to do makeup, and the director asked if I wanted to be 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The director, Joy Ray, had used Josh for "Brain Drain" and also selected him 
to work on another music video, Porno for Pyros' "Sadness," this time only off 
camera. "I had to create more scars on an actor's back that matched the 
scarring he already had. It took a little while before it was right, but I got 
the hang of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Josh's biggest project to date has been creating a hunchback for an actor in 
the West Coast Ensemble's production of "La Malasangre" in Hollywood, which 
closed in December. "It's the first job that wakes me up at night. In a film, 
you create an effect, and you rely on the camera and the editing to give you 
the best angle. With a play, the audience is all around, and I needed to make a 
hunchback that looks real from every seat. And, in a film you do an effect, and 
it just has to work once. With a play, it's got to work every night." 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had any doubts that Josh could do the job," says Robert Madrid, an 
actor and director who recommended Josh for "La Malasangre." "For a 
15-year-old, he's very confident, and he handles himself well. Not many kids 
are like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Being around so much horror, it's hard to believe anything could scare Josh. 
"I can sit through the goriest movies and not even blink," he says. "But real 
violence, real horror, I can't take. I saw someone fall down an escalator and 
get cut up and I just froze and turned white. I'm more squeamish than you'd 
expect." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: Josh Brezner's makeup work can be seen in the music videos "Queenie" by 
Ethyl Meatplow and "Sadness" by Porno for Pyros, currently aired on MTV.

RIGHT FROM WRONG; FOR COLIN MARTIN, THE PAIN OF AIDS MISDIAGNOSIS WAS STARTING 
POINT FOR NEW SHOW, "VIRGINS AND OTHER MYTHS." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Imagine being misdiagnosed with AIDS. It happened to Colin Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started having convulsions, shaking, chills," recalled the actor, who was 
in the middle of a performance class at Pittsburgh's Carnegie- Mellon 
University in 1985 when a mysterious malady suddenly overtook him and he was 
rushed to a hospital. In the emergency room, Martin says, he was told that the 
doctors were "95% sure" he had AIDS. "At the end of the week, they said, 'We're 
95% sure you don't have AIDS, but we won't know for sure for two weeks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For Martin, now 30, the horrific experience proved a watershed event -- and 
the starting point for his new one-man show, "Virgins and Other Myths," which 
will have two workshop performances Sunday and Jan. 16 at the NoHo Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his illness, Martin had a girlfriend, and had also had sex with 
men -- which he says the doctors focused on in their misdiagnosis. (The actor 
was later found to be suffering from exhaustion, dehydration and a viral 
infection.) 
</P>
<P>
 "From that point," he said somberly, "I became aware of AIDS, and had to come 
to grips with my fear of it." 
</P>
<P>
 He began to exercise "compulsively, obsessively -- trying to beat the disease 
I thought was inevitable," he said. He got into support groups and realized 
that he had to deal with his sexuality. He says he also started to uncover 
suppressed childhood memories of sexual abuse. After graduation, Martin, a 
native of Cambridge, Mass., returned home and joined the staff of a children's 
AIDS program at Boston City Hospital; later, he worked in New York for a foster 
care agency placing HIV-positive children. 
</P>
<P>
 After a stint doing publicity for Houston's Alley Theatre, he moved to Los 
Angeles in 1991 and at first laid low, "waiting tables and reading books." In 
1992, accompanying a friend to an audition, he wound up getting cast in Robert 
Chesley's "Dog Plays" at the Celebration Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly I was doing a gay play about AIDS in a gay theater -- and I was 
nude," he said. "The play ran four or five months, and was a big hit. It was 
the first time that my sexual identity and artistic and personal life came 
together in the same room." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Martin has continued down that path with his involvement in 
Artists Confronting AIDS. Last year, in addition to his acting stint opposite 
performer/activist Michael Kearns in "Camille" at Highways, he directed two 
socially charged works, "Myron" and "Off." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult path I've chosen," he said. "I want to be successful, but on 
my own terms. If I have a hero, it would be Michael Kearns. In my family, the 
strongest message I got was to be of service. So I've tried to combine theater 
and film and service -- and the person doing that is Michael." 
</P>
<P>
 Another touchstone in Martin's life is Mindy Kanaskie, an old friend from the 
days at Carnegie-Mellon, who is producing the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he's written is so open, so sincere and gut-wrenching," she said. "I 
love the idea of these kind of pieces, people revealing the honesty and 
dishonesty of their lives. I guess I've led a boring life . . . Through Colin, 
I'm learning to see more." Where and When

THEATER REVIEW; FAR FROM A DREAM; MESSY PLOT MAKES 'A LITTLE MEDITATION' -- A 
MUSICAL PROMOTING HIGHER CONSCIOUSNESS -- CONFUSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "a little Meditation," at the Richard Basehart Playhouse, is a musical that 
deserves its lower-case title. The last term one could associate with this 
ragamuffin piece of work is capital.  
</P>
<P>
 For a show promoting "higher consciousness," everything is pretty much in the 
basement. It is so low, in fact, that the entire plot is actually a kind of 
con: Our hero, Russell (Greg Safel), though presented as a soldier of fortune 
who magically travels into a future land called Essencea (get it?), is actually 
a pilot named Robert who has crashed and is dreaming the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing, though, in the book and music by Maximum Mix, Buddy Mix and 
Christopher Barnhard really fulfills this ersatz "Wizard of Oz" plot device. No 
one in Robert's actual life -- vaguely presented as Lakota tribes people and 
their friends -- clearly corresponds with the Essencean world he dreams. 
Absolutely nothing links up; not the best way to develop anyone's higher 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "Meditation" amounts to a patchwork New Age pop opera murkily 
directed by Mark McQuown and filled with solemn turbaned spiritual guides; the 
evil and good daughters (Licia Shearer and Christine Scherpf, respectively) of 
the High Priest (James Blevins); and something known as The Essence (Carole 
Love), who stands in a cave with a shredded white wig covering her entire head 
and whose profound utterances are mostly drowned out by the over-amplified and 
tinny synthesized music. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, but there's more. There's evil daughter Leleah, whose numbers are 
invariably bump-and-grind variations (Shearer, at least, is the only singer 
here who invests any passion) on Leleah's bad-chick ways. There's the 
impossible-to-follow Essencea plot, eventually sending Russell into a chamber 
of mirrors looking for the good daughter, Lelissa, whom he loves. There's 
Michael Roth's ugly set design (mostly a background of cheesy-looking rocks) 
that, by the way, doesn't include a chamber of mirrors. There's the muddy and 
ear-piercing sound system (care of Nikkodo U.S.A.) and the needless miking of 
the cast. 
</P>
<P>
 This show loses track of its identity, which presumably revolves around Robert 
/ Russell. No 1994 guy in jeans, not even Safel's nice-seeming soldier of 
fortune, could compete with a futuristic fairy-tale-style sibling rivalry. So 
Robert literally gets lost in his own dream and lets Leleah and Lelissa take it 
over. Rather than the helpful good-evil ethics of the fairy tale, though, we're 
offered nothing more than New Ageisms like "follow your heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, while that's a fine phrase, it's an empty message for a spiritually 
concerned show. And it's hard to see how any of this has anything to do with 
Robert: This is no dream any respectable Freudian would touch, and this is no 
show any respectable dramaturge would have a clue knowing how to solve. Where

QUESTIONING THE RULES; 'JANE'S JOURNAL' IS A PLAY ABOUT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE 
HER OWN CHOICES IN A CHANGING WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes regularly about

<TEXT>
<P>
 Merry Shaman was 18 when she first read Dee Wells' novel "Jane." This was in 
the '70s, when the sexual revolution was at its acme and feminism was breaking 
down society's walls. Wells' ideas about the possibilities of women's choices, 
right or wrong, hit a chord with Shaman. 
</P>
<P>
 That chord has resonated through time and finds its expression in Shaman's 
stage adaptation of the novel, "Jane's Journal," opening tonight at North 
Hollywood's Limelight Playhouse, in which Shaman also plays the title role. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in New York's South Bronx, she was attuned to what was happening in the 
world outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not terribly sheltered," Shaman says. "There were shootouts on my 
street. I was rather precocious. I read a lot, and I knew what was going on 
when I was pretty young. And there was a lot going on, particularly in women's 
issues. Very different messages were coming out to young women." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaman admits that she understands Jane better now, but that at the time it 
was intriguing to have a view of what she thought was a very real person living 
in the world as it was evolving. 
</P>
<P>
 The character Jane is an American newspaper film critic living in London, who 
makes choices which, right or wrong, are what she has to do. One of those 
choices involves her concurrent, and carefully timed, affairs with a black 
American law student and a brash young British burglar. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaman -- whose first play, "Mother and Daughter Reunion" was produced while 
she was still in college -- says she was immediately and permanently drawn to 
the character. She remembers her first impression: "Jane was real. She was no 
big role model. She made a lot of sloppy choices. She wasn't really a good girl 
or a bad girl, just a woman of her time. With lots of choices, lots of them, 
she was bound to make a few poor ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaman and her director, Kevin Shaw made the decision to separate the play 
from the '70s, because the statements Wells had to make about Jane were 
timeless in an ever-changing world. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, who is remembered for his co-direction of Thomas Babe's "A Prayer for My 
Daughter" last year, says: "This still could happen, it still does happen. What 
would you do in this situation? It will still engage an audience. The mores of 
society haven't changed that much. Even today, some people are going to sit in 
the theater and look at Jane and judge her as a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaman smiles and responds, "Maybe even more, because there's not as much free 
thinking as there was then." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still wrong," Shaw continues, "that people are so judgmental. People 
haven't changed as much as we'd like to think. That's what's interesting in the 
play. It may be the same way even 20 years further down the road. People may 
still look at women and say that they're expected to behave in such a way, and 
that they should make certain choices in these situations, regardless. That 
hasn't changed, and I don't know if it will ever change." 
</P>
<P>
 The core of Wells' tale, without any topical reference, is timeless. Shaman 
feels that it asks important questions about the rules of society that would be 
pertinent at any time -- today, tomorrow, yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real life," Shaw says. "Jane's choices are not morally correct, or the 
right thing to do, but they're real. Real people's choices are reality-based. 
Some people are going to like the characters, some are not. That's its reality. 
I want people to walk away from the theater arguing over which man Jane should 
stay with." 
</P>
<P>
 Does the play have a message? 
</P>
<P>
 Shaman says with a smile: "The message is that we each have our own little 
world, and a bigger world that we affect. What we put out into that bigger 
world makes that world. Simple." Where and When

FOLK FOR THE FUTURE; FRED STARNER IS DEDICATED TO PROMOTING THE LASTING VALUE 
OF THIS 'LIVING TRADITION' THROUGH A SERIES OF CONCERTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Let the "folk fascists" sleep in the past, adrift in their musical dreamland, 
restricted to the sounds of earlier centuries. Singer-songwriter Fred Starner 
wants none of that, or not too much of it anyway. Too many things to sing about 
today . 
</P>
<P>
 There always have been for Starner and his ilk, whether it was about saving 
the ruined environment or the travels by rail of modern hobos. Starner is 54 
now, and has been singing about such matters since 1969, when he first met up 
with that ageless folk master Pete Seeger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Folk music is a living tradition," insists Starner, who has come to a funky 
Venice coffeehouse this afternoon to chat, armed with both banjo and guitar. 
"Folk musicians deal with myths, the great myths. And you have to think up 
stories and jokes and anecdotes to convince people it's worthwhile to spend tax 
money on the spotted owl or whatever it is. Art has always done that." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, American folk music hasn't the same high profile it had in the late 
1960s and early '70s, when Starner was singing alongside Seeger, Don McLean (of 
the folk epic "American Pie") and a crowd of others. It's rarely heard on 
commercial radio. That's in spite of such popular neo-folk artists as Tracy 
Chapman, and the continuing influence of Bob Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
 It's gotten to a point where Pete Seeger now identifies himself not as a folk 
singer, but as a "river singer," Starner says. "That confuses them; they don't 
know what that means. I don't know, the word 'folk singer' has a negative 
connotation or something: old fashioned, out-of-date, sentimental or whatever 
it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Starner is doing what he can to spread the good news of American folk's 
lasting value through a series of intimate concerts he has organized for this 
month at Book Grinders, a coffeehouse and bookstore in Van Nuys. Beginning 
Saturday night with a performance by Starner and the blues-based Del Grossos, 
the three-weekend series celebrates "Folk Music and Dance Month," as declared 
by the 3,000-member national Folk Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sides to the folk music tradition will be explored subsequent weekends: 
Ross Altman performs a tribute to the folk-blues troubadour Leadbelly on Jan. 
15; singer-harpist Bobbie Jo Erikson joins Starner on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Jan. 15 will be an afternoon folk music workshop for children, led by 
Erikson and by Starner, who has released two albums of folk for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The music of Leadbelly, Altman says, was "a forerunner of the protest movement 
of the '60s. His work for 30 and 40 years before the modern civil rights 
movement was one of the most public forums for black music." 
</P>
<P>
 The Book Grinders shows are one indication of how the growing L.A. coffeehouse 
scene is providing a popular venue for acoustic singer-songwriters of folk, 
folk-rock, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coffeehouses are natural places for folk music," says Juli Michaud, manager 
of Book Grinders. "There is a resurgence of folk music right now, and I happen 
to like it." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's helped," Starner says of the new venues for his music, but he isn't 
completely satisfied. "They don't let people play for six months at a time. . . 
. Bob Dylan, when he started out, played every night at 10 o'clock or whatever 
it was. Phil Ochs did the same thing. And management realized they had 
somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 For Starner, who lives with his wife and daughter in Winnetka, folk music 
alone doesn't pay the bills. This singer-songwriter is also a part-time teacher 
of economics at community colleges in Glendale, Moorpark and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 There's only occasional evidence of that and the tenured position he left 
behind five years ago at the University of Wisconsin at LaCrosse in his 
original songs. In his song "Marlboro Man," Starner argues the irrelevance of 
junk bonds, the gross national product and Michael Milken in the simpler world 
of the hobo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably know too much about economic problems," Starner says. "I see that 
as the root of a lot of issues." 
</P>
<P>
 For him, the main message is easier to grasp: "There are still a lot of people 
like me doing this kind of stuff," he says. "And we have a lot of fun doing it. 
Art has to be entertainment in the end." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: Fred Starner and the Del Grossos, the first of three weekly concerts 
celebrating "Folk Music and Dance Month." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: The Book Grinders, 13321 Burbank Blvd., Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 8 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: Free. 
</P>
<P>
 Also: Ross Altman tribute to Leadbelly at 8 p.m. Jan. 15, and singer-harpist 
Bobbie Jo Erikson with Starner at 8 p.m. Jan. 22.

THE VALLEYS' SUPPORTING ROLES; HOLLYWOOD KEEPS COMING BACK TO THIS AREA TO FIND 
A WIDE VARIETY OF SETTINGS FOR MOVIE AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION.

 "A rock is a rock, a tree is a tree -- shoot it in Griffith Park!"  
</P>
<P>
 -- Abe Stern, film producer and uncle of Carl Laemmle, founder of Universal 
Studios 
</P>
<P>
 At old Mission San Fernando, Jane Wyman marries Cesar Romero in the kind of 
ceremony that the mission's Franciscan fathers didn't exactly have in mind when 
they built the chapel back in 1797. This wedding is strictly make-believe, 
recorded by cameras for a 1986 episode of CBS-TV's "Falcon Crest." 
</P>
<P>
 "It even made the front page of the National Enquirer!" Kevin Feeney, the 
mission's business manager, recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Antelope Valley, a few residents gather beneath a glitzy, Las 
Vegas-style marquee bearing the name of singer Vic Damone. They ask someone how 
they can obtain tickets to Damone's concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, there are neither tickets nor concert. The marquee is a prop for the 
1991 feature film "The Marrying Man," starring Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley community of Lake View Terrace, a medical facility 
turned film-and-TV set has served motion pictures such as "Terminator 2: 
Judgment Day" "Postcards From the Edge" and "Another 48 Hours" -- not far, 
incidentally, from the scene of a video watched by millions around the world: 
the beating of Rodney G. King by Los Angeles police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 And on leafy Orion Avenue in Van Nuys -- whose white picket fences, spacious 
lawns and shuttered Cape Cod houses have appeared in movies ("La Bamba" and 
"Big Trouble") and TV series ("Dallas" and "CHiPs") -- a homeowner recalls an 
early morning when her teen-age son burst out the door on his way to school, 
only to be startled by cameras on the front porch shooting actor Peter Falk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoops! I guess I ruined your shoot," the youngster said apologetically. 
</P>
<P>
 Year after year, Hollywood comes calling -- sometimes in a neighborhood near 
you. And three stars of the show are every bit as venerable and versatile as 
top-drawer character actors. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, which have 
appeared in so many productions -- from blockbuster films to TV series to 
videos to commercials -- that they deserve their very own stars on the 
sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the list of on-location sites -- even predating ex-New Yorker Carl 
Laemmle's transformation of a 230-acre chicken ranch in 1914 to what is now 
Universal City -- seemingly stretches as long as Hollywood Boulevard: Griffith 
Park ("Batman," "Bonanza," "Rebel Without a Cause"), the Van Nuys Airport 
("Casablanca"), the Iverson Ranch in Chatsworth ("Ben-Hur," "Rin Tin Tin"), 
Malibu Creek State Park, partly in Agoura ("M*A*S*H*," "How Green Was My 
Valley"), the Sepulveda Veterans Affairs Medical Center in North Hills 
("Altered States," "Knots Landing"), East Palmdale Boulevard ("Radio Flyer"), 
and the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in Van Nuys ("Rising Sun," "Murder, She 
Wrote"), among myriad others. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, countless private residences and estates provide settings as 
dramatic as Mediterranean villas or Tudor mansions, which look as if they're in 
Connecticut or New Jersey. Or, many locations appear as perfectly mundane as 
the "Leave It to Beaver" set or any other house that might pass for Anywhere, 
U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Each has been deployed again and again by producers and directors who often 
anchor their flings of fantasy in real-life, everyday places. There, production 
companies pay homeowners and landlords rental fees ranging from $250 to upward 
of $15,000 a day, noting that they'll probably have to rearrange walls, 
furnishings and sometimes even landscaping, but promising to restore all 
properties exactly to the way they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, their work begins months earlier when scouts for the Los Angeles 
area's 40-odd location companies try to match real-life sites with those 
described in scripts. They bird-dog neighborhoods and study huge books of 
wide-angle color photos in quest of a perfect match. Example: One scout 
recently examined photos at Real to Reel Inc., a Los Angeles location agency, 
hoping to find what he called "a 1947 kitchen" for a work-in-progress titled 
"Roswell," about tales of UFOs landing near Roswell, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 And whenever on-location shooting won't work, filmmakers rely on back lots and 
sound stages such as those at Universal Studios Hollywood, Warner Bros. and 
Walt Disney Corp. in Burbank or Santa Clarita Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they turn to recycled locations such as the National Park Service's 
Paramount Ranch, deep in the hardscrabble hills of south Agoura and the setting 
for 1930s films such as "Adventures of Marco Polo" and "The Adventures of Tom 
Sawyer." Amid rickety facades that hark back to the wild, wild West, CBS-TV's 
"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" dominates production so much nowadays that Alice 
Allen, who issues permits to do film or TV work at the Paramount Ranch 
facility, quips, "The doctor is in residence here." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not by accident that the three valleys -- especially the San Fernando 
Valley -- turn up on millions of big and small screens across America, 
sometimes with a presence as indelible as John Wayne swaggering to an Oscar in 
the 1969 motion picture "True Grit." 
</P>
<P>
 More movie-making and television production occurs in the Valley than in any 
other single area of Los Angeles, author Richard Alleman writes in "The Movie 
Lover's Guide to Hollywood" -- the Valley accounting for about one-third of 
film and TV production in all of the city, says Hollywood film historian Marc 
Wanamaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, you had many studios in the Valley -- then came the studio ranches and 
all the other locations," says Wanamaker, now at work on a history of U.S. 
motion-picture studios. 
</P>
<P>
 With their craggy hills, sprawling desert, crowded urbanscape and assorted 
foliage (which enables filmmakers to shun, if they need to, Southern 
California's patented "palm tree" look), the three valleys have offered 
filmmakers virtually unlimited choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The busiest location? Griffith Park, according to some location scouts and 
librarians at the Hollywood-based California Film Commission. It's the setting 
for portions of feature films such as "Hoffa," "Poetic Justice," "Dave" and 
"Jurassic Park," as well as TV's "MacGyver," "The Wonder Years" and "Doogie 
Howser, M.D.," among many others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable how much filming goes on there," says Czechoslovakian-born 
Paul Pav of North Hollywood, whose credits as a location manager include 
"Lethal Weapon 3," "Poltergeist" and "Ghostbusters." "In Griffith Park, you've 
got New York, you've got the South, you've got whatever you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Another site rich in motion-picture lore is the Van Nuys Airport, the setting 
for portions of the 1942 Warner Bros. classic "Casablanca." But stories about 
filming of the famous scene in which Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, as 
World War II lovers, say goodby at a foggy Moroccan airstrip are shrouded in a 
fog of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 While some published accounts say filming took place at the Van Nuys Airport 
(then known as Los Angeles Municipal Airport), others describe the location 
variously as the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport and Glendale's old Grand 
Central Air Terminal, now part of an industrial park. Actually, historian 
Wanamaker says, Bogart and Bergman bade farewell on a Burbank sound stage, with 
the takeoff created by special effects and a miniature plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Another film historian, Dick Mason of Warner Bros., chuckles at the confusion. 
"Embellishment is the name of the game among people in this business," he says. 
"Everyone exaggerates." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, a private house in Arleta served as a set in "Back to the Future," 
while Chatsworth's Iverson Ranch provided scenes for the spectacular chariot 
race in 1959's Oscar-winning "Ben-Hur," for other films such as "Julius Caesar" 
and "The Robe" and for TV series such as "Bat Masterson" and "Zane Grey 
Theater." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Santa Clarita Valley takes pride in its remote but high-profile 
Vasquez Rocks ("Battlestar Gallactica," "Star Trek," "Charge of the Light 
Brigade" and Steven Spielberg's upcoming "The Flintstones"), while hundreds of 
Antelope Valley residents recall the winter night in 1992 when they watched 
parts of an abandoned, half-completed residential tract on Lancaster's 
outskirts go up in flames after filmmakers received permission to burn 10 
houses for a fiery scene in "Lethal Weapon 3." 
</P>
<P>
 "Out here, we think we can offer just about any kind of location," says 
Stephanie Abrahamson, director of the Antelope Valley Film Assn. "And if you 
want it, we can give you 360 degrees and not a human in sight." 
</P>
<P>
 But today, pitching Southern California to filmmakers is a tough sell as Los 
Angeles struggles to remain the world's "movie capital" in the heat of 
competition from Canada, New York, Florida, Illinois and other venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Permits issued by the city for on-location filmmaking declined 20% between 
1990 (the peak year) and 1992, according to a report in Location Update, a 
monthly trade magazine published in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem stems from not just a flagging economy but what some call a "user- 
unfriendly " climate in some neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. residents, by no means in awe of an industry shoot, don't like the 
inconveniences it brings -- parking problems, late-night noise, trespassing," 
Location Update reports. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, location manager Pav says the prospect of Hollywood pitching 
camp in the neighborhood "goes both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people will slam the door -- or they'll send their dogs after you," he 
says of his own scouting forays. "On the other hand, some keep sending you 
pictures of their house with a note: 'Please! Use my house!' They know it can 
be lucrative -- especially when the economy isn't so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Even on that squeaky-clean block of Van Nuys' Orion Avenue, on-site filmmaking 
has drawn mixed reviews from residents since the camera vans first rolled into 
the neighborhood 21 years ago for a network TV film, "Go Ask Alice" (Andy 
Griffith, William Shatner and Julie Adams). 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while, we thought it was overdone -- people were out here shooting at 3 
and 4 in the morning, for months at a time," says Jean Austin, a retired 
Hollywood hairdresser who adds that she has lived on Orion Avenue for 30 years. 
"Sometimes you have to say, 'Enough!' -- as much as we're all trying to keep 
filming in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 A few doors away, Keith and Marilyn Mullins contend that filmmaking on Orion 
Avenue is far more blessing than curse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always welcomed," says Keith Mullins, adding that their house served as 
a set for "Go Ask Alice" and for Great Western Savings' TV spots featuring 
Dennis Weaver. "The film companies do everything they can so we'll want them to 
come back. Especially today, we don't want to lose them." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Mayor Richard Riordan and newly appointed "film czar" Cody G. Cluff 
of the Los Angeles Film Commission leading the charge, the city has served 
notice that it intends to regain its filmmaking glitter. 
</P>
<P>
 The applause is loudest among entrepreneurs such as Jim Thompson, president of 
Real to Reel Inc., and others who've staked their futures on Valley-area and 
other filmmaking within the "30-mile zone," a radius from La Cienega and 
Beverly boulevards, beyond which production in Southern California is more 
expensive because of added labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities such as Toronto and Chicago have hurt us tremendously," says Thompson, 
40, who also is publisher/editor-in-chief of Location Update. "But there's a 
feeling now that everything will turn around again -- and that a lot of 
business will come back to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Hollywood keeps calling with fistfuls of cash -- and the Griffith 
Parks, the Orion Avenues, the Vasquez Rocks, the East Palmdale Boulevards and 
the Paramount Ranches endure on the silver screen and in living rooms across 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
 For that matter, so does the work of Paul Pav, Real to Reel Inc. and all those 
other location scouts who keep scouring the neighborhoods and poring over those 
thick photo books in search of that perfect "1947 kitchen" and other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 They work with a painstaking zeal that continues to remind the San Fernando, 
Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys that, yes, they ought to be in pictures -- 
and in a way that keeps saying to them: "Here's looking at you, kid." Where 
Real Becomes Reel

THROUGH AND THROUGH; THE CLEAR, SHEER BEAUTY OF GLASS AS ART IS ON DISPLAY IN 
WORKS AT THE FINEGOOD GALLERY IN WOODLAND HILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Kapitanoff writes regularly 
about art for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glass can't possibly be an artistic medium, according to many art world 
authorities. Some of them think it's too pretty to be considered art. Others 
suggest the medium is too fragile to withstand earthquakes and the test of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 But several independent artists ignore the critics and make art out of glass. 
Anyone skeptical of that notion may withdraw their doubts after a visit to the 
exhibit "Contemporary Glass: Form and Function" at the Finegood Art Gallery in 
Woodland Hills. Those already enamored of glass's attributes will delight in 
the sensuous qualities of almost 50 works ranging from abstract visions to 
functional lamps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at it as an architectural glass show, but I included various 
techniques," said guest curator Ruth Summers. "Some of the pieces are maquettes 
of large installation pieces. Most of the artists in the exhibit have done 
large-scale indoor and outdoor projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Summers ran the Kurland/Summers gallery in West Hollywood for 11 years before 
it closed and she became a private dealer and art appraiser. Bringing together 
the work of 15 artists -- 12 of them from Southern California -- she organized 
this show with the help of the Gallery of Functional Art in Santa Monica and 
the Patricia Correia Gallery in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruth is a fine curator in this field. People know her and respect her," said 
Merkie Rowan, a member of the Jewish Federation Council's San Fernando Valley 
Art Council. Rowan came up with the idea for a glass art show and contacted 
Summers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan said that without Summers' expertise, she herself "might have had a more 
production-, more commercial-type of show. Ruth really elevated the level of 
the show. I didn't anticipate we could have a show of this caliber. This is 
more exciting and valuable to our gallery." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Schauer's leaded clear glass "Longbeach Series 2" demonstrates glass's 
enthralling ability to play with light. The piece has been appropriately hung 
to interact with light, cast shadows on the gallery walls and form an energetic 
atmosphere that far exceeds the work itself. "Without light, you lose what the 
piece is about," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, Steven V. Correia did production work when he was owner and 
designer of Correia Art Glass. Working now as an independent artist, he finely 
cuts and polishes German optical crystal chunks into precisely formed 
sculptures such as "Magnum Diamond." His "Dichroic V Series-Maquettes" feature 
cable and dichroic glass, which exhibits two different colors when viewed from 
two different directions under transmitted or reflected light. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was first developed by Xerox to transmit the color in a color Xerox 
machine," Summers said. By walking around Correia's dichroic pieces, one can 
see their colors change. 
</P>
<P>
 Thermon Statom used commercial plate glass with found and made objects and 
paint in his large, boxlike constructions, "New Moon Ladder" and "Night Thing." 
Playing cards -- especially Mexican Tarot cards -- are a common element in his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Silver's "Portal," made of cut and beveled commercial plate glass 
laminated with blown glass, is his largest work to date, Summers said. His 
large sculptures have grown out of the perfume bottles he makes. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Stinsmuehlen-Amend's leaded glass and ash frame screen "Pro-Rata 
Lyricism" conveys the lightness and stability of architecturally oriented glass 
art. Deanne Sabeck incorporated glass, stone and neon in two "Fragment Series" 
works. They suggest an earthiness unlike most of the other pieces in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The elegant "Vase 28," by Sidney Hutter, has been fashioned from commercial 
plate glass pieces that he cut, polished, assembled and glued. Hutter is one of 
12 artists who has been commissioned to do a piece for the White House glass 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists represented in the show are: Greg Abbott, Baron Bernstein, 
Christopher Lee, John Gilbert Luebtow, Paul Marioni, Michael Murphy, Dick 
Weiss, William Wertz. Where and When

A ROOM OF THEIR OWN; EAGLES COFFEE PUB HAS FURNISHED THE ANNEX NEXT STORE WITH 
ARMCHAIRS AND A STAGE TO ACCOMMODATE WEEKLY READINGS, INCLUDING POEMS, SHORT 
STORIES, MONOLOGUES AND IMPROVISATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The charm of cafe life is obvious at Eagles Coffee Pub. Situated on a 
spruced-up block of Lankershim Boulevard and down the street from a karate 
studio, Eagles welcomes anyone hungry for a sandwich, a mug of joe, a game of 
chess, lively music or meaty conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday's open-mike poetry nights, what's also evident -- especially to 
writers -- is the appeal of a place that distinguishes art from coffee-bar 
commerce. Between 9 and 9:30 p.m., when poets begin to read, they don't have to 
shout down espresso machines or chatty customers. They don't even have to look 
at them. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year and a half of conducting readings in the usual coffeehouse way -- 
in a crowded corner of a tiny club -- Eagles has separated the two camps by 
renting the store next door and giving performers their own turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do more to address the service needs of poets," said Eagles' 
owner Star Irvine, who furnished the new room with cozy armchairs, put in a 
stage and installed a newsstand for pre-show browsing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it opened in November, the annex (also used for music events) has been a 
big hit with the literati. "It's an optimal space for the arts," said Jane 
Laurel Sobo, a Reseda poet and regular at the readings, which are known as 
"Skinny Leonard's Free Verse." 
</P>
<P>
 "At other coffeehouses," Sobo added, "if readings are good for business, they 
keep going; if not, they fizzle. Here, there's a different level of 
commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 The setup is perfect for those who want to make an evening of their stage 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Before reading, writers can hit the cafe for a cappuccino, an Elvis sandwich 
(peanut butter, honey and bananas on wheat toast) and the board game of their 
choice. Next door, after signing up for first-come, first-served mike time, 
they might wander among racks of magazines that range all over the social and 
cultural map -- from Tattoo to Paris Review, and from Freak Brothers to Town 
and Country to Investor's Business Daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd tends toward the college-age, combat-boot set, but embraces serious 
writers of any age. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground rules -- announced at the beginning of each reading by emcee Andrew 
Michael Berger -- limit participants to three poems or 10 to 15 minutes on 
stage. Enforcement, though, is lax, in keeping with the freewheeling spirit of 
these events. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to poetry of all persuasions, short stories, monologues and even 
improvisational performance are permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's felt, I'll let people just go up and speak their feelings," said 
Berger, a North Hollywood writer who has presided over the evenings for a year. 
And on some nights, poets -- many of whom identify themselves only by their 
first names -- will spontaneously start a collective, free-associative work 
called "roaming verse." Participants get up and say whatever pops to mind 
before passing the mike to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of these experiments is partly due to Eagles' audience, which is 
respectful and supportive -- particularly of the diverse forms creativity 
takes. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Skinny Leonard's evening, enthusiasm ran high for "Larry H." and 
his funny story about a thief; "Donna L.," who evoked, through words and 
movement, "life in a technocratic society"; "Shanda," author of angry poems 
about cocky men and officious employers; "Dan" and his "dead-dog poem," and Len 
Doucette, a homeless writer in a suit who read about street waifs and social 
indifference.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: A CHANCE TO LEARN HAT TRICKS; YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN AT 
THIS STORE, OR BUY MILLINERY SUPPLIES AT NEAR WHOLESALE PRICES.

 With the start of a New Year, it seems that our creative juices get moving, 
and many of us want to jump into a new hobby or craft. I always feel a twinge 
of guilt that I didn't make the Christmas gifts I gave, and I'm determined that 
next year all my gifts will be my own creations. To get those creative juices 
going, a visit to Hats By Leko may be in order. 
</P>
<P>
 What started out as a small retail outlet for hats and hat-making classes has 
evolved into a complete millinery supply store for designers and manufacturers, 
as well as a domestic source for imported straws and felts in many shapes and 
sizes. Anyone into hats -- or ribbons and flowers and feathers and trims of all 
kind -- will be in hog heaven at Hats By Leko. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices are wholesale, whether it's the hats or trim, and volume buying brings 
the prices even lower. An elegant wide-brimmed ribbon straw hat is $10.50, 
without trim. Once you add your own color and flowers, it could end up around 
$20. At an upscale women's shop up the street, the same basic hat is $100. 
Parasisol (a kind of straw) hoods, milliner's terminology for the unblocked 
shape, come in a palette of colors and sell for $11.50. A crocheted cloche is 
$7.50; a raffia-braid brimmed hat is $10, a twisted toyo (a type of straw) is 
$7.50, and a twisted sea-grass straw is $6.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Millinery supplies are wholesale or slightly above. A two-millimeter silk 
ribbon runs $2.35 for a five-yard spool. A millinery grosgrain, seven-eighths 
of an inch wide, comes on a 50-yard roll for $17. Beautiful, handmade French 
ribbon pansies that retail for $7.50 are $6 here, but they are $3.65 each if 
you buy a dozen. Some antiqued gardenias, about two inches wide and in luscious 
tones, range from $2.50 in satin to $4.50 for a satin and velvet combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Leko is the creative force who can design a hat for you or teach you 
how to make your own in one of her classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Free-Form Straw, a four-class series, covers the basics of hat-making. The 
next class is scheduled to begin Feb. 3 from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. The $165 class 
fee does not include supplies, although students can buy them at the volume 
rate. Students make six to eight hats during the course -- which makes the 
class seem a lot more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 Leko also teaches classes in felt blocking and has more than 300 hat blocks 
from which to choose. Her shop is the only place in the West where hat blocks 
are available for rent, Leko says. She rents them to students for $15 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 A good collection of books, which run from $5 to $35, is available on the art 
of making hats, ribbon work, embroidery flowers, buttons, cushions, tassels and 
costume masks. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a Dickensian charm in this cluttered little shop, and it just might 
ignite a hidden talent.

ALLURING SLEEPING BEAUTIES; NOW IS THE CHEAPEST TIME TO BUY BARE-ROOT PLANTS, 
WHICH ARE SOLD IN A DORMANT STATE AND WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF SOIL OR POT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN HEEGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Susan Heeger writes regularly about 
gardening for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the term "bare root" gives you the shivers, you're not alone. It takes guts 
to shell out for some leafless, lifeless-looking twigs, and a wizard's eye to 
envision them as the rosebush or peach tree pictured on their tag. 
</P>
<P>
 For those willing to take the plunge, the most appealing payoff may come in 
dollars. Bare-root plants -- those sold in a dormant state, without benefit of 
soil or pot and possibly wrapped in a plastic bag -- cost one-third to one-half 
less than they will in spring. During bare-root season (which usually lasts 
from late December into early February) the selection is also better, with more 
plants and varieties to choose from. And to ease the risk of purchasing 
something virtually sight unseen, most nurseries offer money-back or 
replacement guarantees on bare-root buys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people who wait all year to get these roses," says Melinda Butler of 
Steven's Nursery and Hardware in North Hollywood. "It's cheaper, and they get 
the colors they want. Our customers have good luck with them." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to roses, other plants sold locally in naked, no-frills form 
include stone-fruit trees, grapes and berries. "We're limited to plants that 
lose all their leaves," says Darrell Waldron, owner of Sheridan Gardens Nursery 
in Sun Valley. "Since they don't have leaves that need water, you can cut off 
half the root system and the plant won't suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 While a broad selection of perennials fits the bare-root bill, "Southern 
Californians don't like shrubs that lose their leaves," Waldron says. This 
explains in part why Valley nurseries don't stock much beyond roses and fruit 
trees in bare-root form. The warmth of our winters further narrows the field, 
eliminating, for example, those fruit trees that require extended periods of 
chill to be productive. 
</P>
<P>
 But local offerings are still impressive. Waldron's nursery kicks off 
bare-root season with 6,000 new roses -- in 250 varieties -- and a host of 
fruit trees: apricots, apples, peaches, nectarines, plums and persimmons, to 
name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 To give his customers a head start in nurturing their fledgling greens, 
Waldron's staff pots them in plantable, biodegradable fiber containers. "Part 
of the risk of buying bare-root," Waldron says, "is that people don't always 
plant them immediately -- which they should. These fiber pots give the roots a 
medium; they don't need immediate planting, just water." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the nursery industry, Waldron estimates, there is "a less than 5% 
loss ratio" for bare-root plants. Still, Karen Petersen of Chatsworth Nursery, 
which got out of the bare-root business several years ago, feels that "going 
this route is really for those who know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 She and others agree that some degree of knowledge is critical even to make a 
good buy. Because of the threat of dehydration -- and premature, package-bound 
growth -- shoppers are advised to choose plants that are displayed outside in 
the shade rather than in a warm store. "And inspect the roots if you can," adds 
Shigeru Tsuchiyama, owner of West Valley Nursery in Tarzana. "A common problem 
in packaging is that the roots may be cut too severely in order to fit the 
package." At West Valley, bare-root roses are heeled into sawdust to enable 
customers to pull them out and examine them. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you determine the potential beauty and health of a very minimal-looking 
plant? It's a challenge, says Mick Sears, chairman of the agriculture 
department at Pierce College, but he offers some pointers. With a fruit tree, 
he advises, "check for healthy, solid-looking bark and branches and a good 
branching structure that grows up and out in different directions. The roots, 
too, should have a good spread pattern." In roses, he counsels, "Look for 
green, plump, budded canes that aren't sprouting -- that signals an old plant." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to planting and care, Sears recommends advance homework. In 
addition to Sunset's "New Western Garden Book," which he calls "the bible," he 
singles out other helpful books -- available at any nursery -- published by 
Sunset and Ortho. These detailed guides each address a specific subject such as 
roses, fruit trees, planting, pruning or fertilizing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting the books will save you a lot of headaches," Sears says. "And when 
you go to select your plant and talk to the nursery people, you'll be able to 
understand what they're telling you."  
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, the effects of the extra effort begin to show quickly. Unless the 
first two months of the year are especially chilly, the bare-root roses you 
plant in January could be blooming shrubs by April Fool's Day -- which could 
serve as a nice comeback for those who doubted that your little sticks would 
ever amount to a hill of beans. Planting Tips 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't let a bare-root plant sit around for long in its wrappings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before planting, conservatively trim the roots and branches, and give it an 
overnight soak in a solution of one tablespoon Vitamin B-1 to one gallon of 
water, recommends Karen Petersen of Chatsworth Nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 * To enrich the planting site, amend the soil with blood meal, bone meal and 
nitro humus or potting soil, suggests Mick Sears of the agriculture department 
at Pierce College. But don't go overboard: Amended soil that is too different 
from a garden's native earth can work against healthy root growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * For roses, create a cone of soil in the planting hole and spread the roots 
evenly over the mound, taking care that any grafts should be two inches above 
the soil level and turned away from hot, southern exposure. The grafts of trees 
should be similarly protected from baking heat, Sears says, and if they're 
planted in an area of heavy sun, white-washing or wrapping their trunks with 
heavy paper can stave off sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mound up the earth around trees to guard against dehydration, says Darrell 
Waldron of Sheridan Gardens Nursery. And if Santa Ana winds arise, hose off 
taller trees two or three times a day to prevent them from drying out.

DOWN-TO-EARTH KIDS; STUDENTS GET ENTHUSED ABOUT PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT AS 
MEMBERS OF AN ORGANIZATION BEGUN BY A TERMINALLY ILL CHILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 All Maren Steiner, 11, wanted when she joined Kids for Saving Earth a few 
years ago was to help protect the environment. But in the process of forming a 
Northridge chapter of the Minnesota- based organization, she and other members 
say they have learned a lot about what it takes to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The national club, an independent, nonprofit organization that now boasts more 
than 700,000 members worldwide, was founded in 1989 by fifth-grader Clinton 
Hill before he died of a brain tumor. The organization's stated mission is to 
educate and empower children of all ages to work with friends to take positive, 
peaceful action to help protect the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Maren's chapter has 12 members, all gathered, she says, by just walking up to 
children at Nobel Middle School and asking them if they were interested in 
joining. At meetings, the children plot projects they will undertake, from 
planting trees with Beverly Hills-based TreePeople to helping with Heal the 
Bay's beach cleanup, or organizing a Whales on Wheels assembly for nearby 
Beckford Avenue School. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the city of Los Angeles provided curbside recycling, Maren's club 
started the Can Crushing Kids Crew project, with members going door to door 
twice a month collecting recyclables. In April, Maren attended the 
Nickelodeon-sponsored Kids Earth Summit in Orlando, Fla., and talked with Vice 
President Al Gore about the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really fun working with other kids to accomplish something," Maren said. 
"It's hard sometimes to organize a project, but it's rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
 Member Kate Levin, 10, also of Northridge, likes attending the biweekly 
meetings and participating in the group's projects because it gives her a way 
to help others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the feel of doing something for the community and to help out," she 
said. Other club chapters are springing up locally, each with its own purpose 
and character. 
</P>
<P>
 At Leichman High School in Reseda, which specializes in community-based 
instruction for the developmentally disabled, teacher Judy Scheuer started a 
chapter with her 17-year-old students. One student saw a club newsletter and 
suggested that they start recycling cans to earn petty cash for the class. Now 
the students make a habit of collecting cans from their families, taking the 
bus together to the Fallbrook Mall and using the recycling machines there. 
</P>
<P>
 "For these students, something like the rain forest is beyond their 
understanding," Scheuer said. "What they do has to be concrete. But now these 
kids are recyclers for life, and I'm hoping they're going to teach their 
parents recycling, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The no-dues organization gives members certificates and colorful quarterly 
newsletters featuring stories on current issues and close-ups of kids and clubs 
doing interesting ecological activities. It also offers adults a leader's 
guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Rosene, a Minnesota member who was Clinton Hill's sixth-grade teacher, 
says he thinks the organization appeals to children because it was started by a 
kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took the emotional impact of an 11-year-old dying of cancer to get the 
movement going," Rosene said. "Clinton felt grown-ups weren't doing their job, 
so kids should take it on." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheuer says the organization has given her students a jumping-off point, with 
tools like the newsletter to trigger discussions of ecology, trees and nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "When kids see other kids doing something for the environment, it's 
contagious," she says. Where and When 
</P>
<P>

chapters.

GETTING RID OF THE FAT; ENCINO-TARZANA MEDICAL CENTER'S WEIGHT TREATMENT 
PROGRAM DOWNPLAYS DIETING, STRESSES MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS BASED ON 
EDUCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Name a diet and Jody Keeler, a Van Nuys legal assistant, has tried it. She 
loaded her shopping cart with pineapples on the Beverly Hills diet, dined on 
little boxed meals on Jenny Craig, sipped "shakes" on a liquid fast, mixed and 
matched menu items on the food combination diet and selected from "exchange 
lists" on Weight Watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 With each fad diet and commercial program, Keeler quickly dropped 10 or 15 
pounds -- and gained them back even faster. The dial on her bathroom scale 
inched past 300 pounds -- and at one point reached 350. 
</P>
<P>
 Then two years ago, a co-worker told Keeler about Encino-Tarzana Medical 
Center's Weight Treatment Program. It didn't sound much like a diet. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, participants are told it's OK to snack on an occasional 
Snickers bar, ice cream cone or piece of pie. No one gets on a scale. And, get 
this -- the group often holds meetings at delis, pancake houses and fast-food 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeler signed up. Within a year she dropped more than 160 pounds. Her dress 
size shrunk from a 26 to a 10. "I have never weighed this low in my life," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Keeler's situation was extreme, she has plenty of good company in her 
struggles with weight. Experts estimate 65 million people in the United States 
-- including 60% of all women -- are constantly dieting. American consumers 
spend more than $30 billion a year on weight-loss products and programs. But 
despite the nation's dieting obsession, about one in five Americans is 
overweight. 
</P>
<P>
 Diets fail, according to psychotherapist Debbie Rehman Lux, program director 
of the Weight Treatment Program, because they are usually restrictive and 
impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diets try to change the location, time and quantity of food you eat," she 
said. "But there is nothing wrong with volume eating, eating dinner standing 
over a sink or eating mashed potatoes or bagels at 2 a.m. You don't have to 
depend on frozen foods or grapefruit and lettuce." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than advocating a particular diet, Rehman Lux teaches participants 
about fat and calories, so they can make their own decisions about what to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learn how to fill up with stuff we like," said Edward Scott, executive 
producer of the "The Young and the Restless" daytime TV serial, who dropped 20 
pounds since joining the program last year. "I like barbecue, so now I have 
barbecued chicken instead of steak, and I put fat-free ranch dressing on my 
baked potato. If I want pie, I scoop the fruit filling out and don't eat the 
crust. I am full, I am happy, and I am losing weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Since dining out is a fact of life for many people, Rehman Lux teaches 
participants to analyze menus, and meetings are often held at local 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent gathering at an Italian eatery, the group chatted about hobbies, 
jobs and kids, while they munched on pizza and twirled spaghetti around their 
forks. They looked like any after-work crowd -- except for the food scales, 
calorie books and measuring cups strewn around the table.  
</P>
<P>
 Rehman Lux flitted among the diners, challenging them to guess the number of 
calories in a bread stick or glass of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 She held up a small dinner salad and pointed out that it packs a walloping 350 
calories when topped with a few tablespoons of dressing, but the hearty 
vegetable soup contains only about 75 calories a cup. Even pasta is a pretty 
good deal with about 400 calories for a typical restaurant serving.  
</P>
<P>
 No food is off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no such thing as a 'bad' food," Rehman Lux said. "Many dieters feel 
so bad if they eat a cookie that they say, 'I already blew it; I might as well 
keep eating.' But a cookie is not bad, it is just a cookie. We remove the shame 
and embarrassment associated with eating." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting rid of the guilt was the most important factor in Keeler's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned to take the emotions out of food," she said. "Before, if I didn't 
stick to my diet 100%, I would think I failed. Here, no one puts any judgments 
on me, no one weighs me. . . .But they did educate me. I still eat everything 
on my plate, but I learned to eat low-fat choices. And if I want a piece of 
cake or an ice cream cone, I have one, and I don't feel bad." Where and When

<P>
 This course is designed to give the individual with little or no knowledge of

ALL-YEAR HOLIDAY SHOPPING; MANY FIND THEY CAN MAXIMIZE PURCHASING POWER AND 
MINIMIZE HASSLES BY STARTING THE GIFT SEARCH NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

regularly for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who don't start their Christmas shopping until Dec. 24 might be amazed 
that some people have al ready started collecting and wrapping gifts for the 
'94 holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 For Carol Brewer, 47, a stylist at Hair Pros in Agoura Hills, it's not the 
drive to be organized that motivates her to start hunting for the right gift 
even before last year's are packed away. It's her love of shopping that calls 
her to the malls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives me a reason to shop without feeling guilty," she said. "I love to go 
to the malls at least once a week -- checking out the sales and looking for 
bargains -- and if I'm shopping for Christmas, I'm going for a good purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer is after more than just ties, nightgowns and leather wallets. She also 
searches for craft items on sale, such as clear Christmas tree balls that she 
can fill with potpourri, or material or yarn she can make into quilts for 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 She gathers the items in a space under her water bed, where they are kept 
until the gift-giving season returns. "It's kind of like a hope chest for 
others," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Crystal, a Tarzana-based organization expert and member of the National 
Assn. of Professional Organizers, said she is finding an increasing number of 
people who look at holiday shopping as a yearlong effort to maximize their 
purchasing power and minimize the last-minute hassles of finding a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Most early shoppers don't buy the big presents early -- bread machines, video 
toys or electronics -- but stick to such smaller items as costume jewelry, 
baskets of soap, note cards and books. The early birds also don't usually buy 
the extra-special gifts -- for their spouses or partners -- early. The urge to 
select the perfect present typically supersedes the drive to shop early, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to not let a commitment to efficiency or the love of a great 
bargain turn you into a pack rat. "It's a fine line between being 
super-organized and being a compulsive shopper, someone who picks up everything 
on sale without a thought in mind about who it is for," she said. Crystal 
suggested that early shoppers make lists of the people for whom they are 
buying, and check off the names as the items are found. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal also suggested that shoppers opt for only what can fit easily into 
their storage space. While she has seen some people who literally reserve an 
entire room of their house to store the fruits of their shopping forays, most 
people have only under-the-bed or in-the-linen closet spots in which to keep 
their finds. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal recommended using a large plastic crate or basket in a pre-selected 
spot -- the back of a closet, a shelf in the pantry or a corner of a room -- to 
hold the items as they are purchased. She uses a sticker to mark the name of 
the person for which the item is intended, because she often forgets such 
details as the months go by. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, shopping months before Christmas is more than a way to save money 
and prevent the shopping chaos in December. It's a challenge. Said Crystal: 
"It's a game you're playing with yourself. It's the thrill of knowing you saved 
$15 on a gift."

TREASURES BEHIND A FACADE; A MUSEUM OF NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE NEAR LANCASTER 
IS A RELIC OF AMERICA'S ETHNOCENTRIC PAST BUT ALSO HAS MANY INTRIGUING 
ARTIFACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Surrounded by the San Gabriel Mountains, towering Joshua trees and miles of 
bleak desert lies a Native American museum housed in a -- Swiss chalet? 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Indian Museum, a paean to America's ethnocentric past, 
fortunately harbors treasures behind its facade of scalloped facia boards 
painted with pastel butterflies and bluebirds. Artifacts dating back 1,200 
years reveal what life was like for the Southwestern, California and Great 
Basin Native Americans. For kids, there are opportunities to grind corn on 
stone metates and to see how spear points were made. An adjacent half-mile 
nature trail provides a way to learn about the surrounding environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Spring is an ideal season to visit the museum, 18 miles southeast of Lancaster 
in the southwest corner of the Mojave Desert. Warmer months bring carpets of 
purple lupine, white evening primrose, dune primrose, flowering creosote bushes 
and, of course, the bushy, creamy-white blooms of the Joshua tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Amateur archeologist Howard Arden Edwards homesteaded the site in the 1920s, 
using a four-cylinder 1927 Chevy to haul supplies. Building began in 1928 
around huge granite boulders that jut into the structure's living room and form 
the floor of an upper room. Edwards, a Jack-of-all-trades who was a theatrical 
scene painter and circus clown, used the upper room to house his vast 
collection of prehistoric and historic Native American artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthropology student Grace Wilcox Oliver happened upon the site while hiking 
in 1938. She bought it from Edwards, and in 1940 opened it as a museum. The 
state of California purchased the property in 1979 and, after renovations, 
reopened the museum in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 1 p.m.: The sight of the museum in the distance -- its seven pastel peaks 
looking downright storybook among the rugged terrain -- may take you aback. Now 
might be a good time to explain to fellow travelers the reason for the curious 
juxtaposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've come to realize that the museum represents 60 years of how we have 
interpreted American Indian culture," said curator Edra Moore. "In the '30s, 
artifacts were called 'novelties' and 'curios.' Then we looked at other 
cultures in terms of what it took for them to live, adapt and survive in their 
environment. Now it's more about scientific methods -- why does one group 
flourish and another perish? That's all found in the museum." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the museum's main room, Edwards' former living room, now called Kachina 
Hall for the rows of Hopi kachina dolls placed on beams below the soaring, 
pitched ceiling that's painted with large kachina dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Native American motifs are painted on the rafters and beams, faced with the 
spongy wood from Joshua trees. A bear hide hangs from a beam opposite a stuffed 
caribou and a deer head. Black Southwestern pottery made by Santa Clara Pueblo 
tribes and baskets built by Hopis, Papagos and Piutes line tables, just above 
large stone metates . 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids love this room," Moore said. A walk along stone steps through a cavelike 
opening leads to the upper room, built on top of a rock formation. Edwards' 
collections from the Santa Barbara coast and the Channel Islands are here -- 
bone tools, worn metates and arrowheads. The artifacts are displayed as Edwards 
presented them; many are glued on cardboard sheets with hand-printed 
explanations. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of cards show everyday articles used by cultures under the titles 
"The Dawn Maid," "Teko, the Maker of Beads" and "The Mighty Warrior Who Loved 
the Dawn Maid." And for the height of ethnocentricity, an exquisite carved 
ceremonial pipe is titled "A Woman's Cigarette Holder." 
</P>
<P>
 1:45 p.m.: Just beyond the living room is the Southwest Room, the former 
dining room. Oliver outfitted the room with lighted display cases that show 
dioramas Edwards built, along with thousand-year-old artifacts made from the 
yucca plant -- sandals, robes and skirts. Prehistoric pottery shards also are 
displayed, some from the cliff-dwelling Anasazi, along with carved stone effigy 
pots in which the Hohokam, who lived near what is now Phoenix, ground paint. 
</P>
<P>
 The Great Basin Room, a former kitchen, has been renovated into the museum's 
most modern wing. Photographic cutouts of the 1860s reveal how various tribes, 
mostly from Utah, eastern California and New Mexico, lived and adapted to their 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Room, just off the former kitchen, features display cases 
showing projectile points, mortars and pestles and items traded by the area's 
cultures: shell ornaments, obsidian spear points and other weapons. Just beyond 
the room is the museum's gift shop, stocked with Southwestern Native American 
hand-crafted jewelry, kachina dolls, pottery, rugs, fetishes and publications 
on Native American history. 
</P>
<P>
 2:30 p.m.: Visit Joshua Cottage, an adjacent building that houses Mexican 
colonial paintings in a small room where occasional educational programs are 
held. A touch table in the next room is strewn with baskets of corn, Joshua 
seeds and pods, manzanita berries, acorns, pinyon nuts and chia seeds -- 
typical food used by Native Americans. Kids can grind corn on metates and watch 
as a docent demonstrates a fire-starting tool built from sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 3:15 p.m.: The half-mile nature trail leads from Kachina Hall into the desert 
framed by craggy rock formations that jut into a vast sky. Don't forget to look 
up -- you may spot soaring golden eagles or red-tailed hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 14 signposts along the trail that can be used in tandem with a 
nature trail guide booklet. The trail winds around Joshua trees, rock 
formations and an old barn Edwards built. It is a good point from which to view 
native plants and perhaps a few critters -- the kangaroo rat, cactus wren, jack 
rabbit and road runner. Where and When 
</P>
<P>

RESTAURANT REVIEW; 2 CUISINES, SAME GOOD SERVICE; ARUNEE HOUSE STAFFERS 
NONCHALANTLY PUT DINERS AT EASE TO ENJOY THE THAI AND CHINESE DISHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Max Jacobson reviews restaurants every 
Friday in Valley Life! 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The cooking is good and the room engaging at Arunee House, but it is the 
graceful, accommodating attitude of the staff that you remember. Mai pen rai 
("never mind"), as Thais are fond of saying. 
</P>
<P>
 This modest Toluca Lake restaurant has been serving some of the San Fernando 
Valley's best Thai/Chinese cooking for more than 10 years. It's your basic 
neighborhood Thai cafe (with cotton balls stuck to the windows at the moment 
for wintry effect); you sit at red vinyl booths under various pictures of King 
Bhumipol of Thailand -- a direct descendant of the character Yul Brynner played 
in "The King and I" -- as Thai pop music plays in the background. Never mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, I guess, that I like the staff here so much is their casual 
nonchalance. The women who take the order lean on your table with the palms of 
their hands as if you are old pals, and if they run out of whatever you have 
ordered, they just smile, shrug and say (you guessed it), "Never mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The menu is so big, though, you won't care. Arunee House is one of our few 
Thai restaurants that actually acknowledges the fact that Thai and Chinese 
dishes are separate and distinct. It actually maintains two separate kitchens 
-- and chefs -- for the two cuisines. Any time you come, however, count on 
seeing parties chowing down on platters of pad Thai, the fried flat noodles 
eaten with pork, shrimp and bean sprouts, which is the runaway favorite in most 
Thai restaurants. The Chinese chef, I suspect, must get mighty lonely at times. 
</P>
<P>
 Kao tod , larb nuea and Arunee's shrimp are three Thai appetizers that 
probably contribute to his loneliness. Kao tod look like Rice Krispie squares, 
but closer examination reveals that they are essentially just savory squares of 
baked puffed rice -- with no marshmallow creme. Top them with an accompanying 
sauce containing minced pork, cucumbers, chiles and sugar, and you have one of 
the world's great snacks. This version stands up to any I've run across in 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Larb nuea is the fiery hot appetizer from Isaan, the Thai northeast. The dish 
is made from ground beef mixed with rice powder and, you might say, gunpowder 
-- a searingly hot chile mixture that makes your hair stand on end. Some 
restaurants soft-pedal this dish for us, but not Arunee House. Here's a 
lifesaving hint: Mix it with white rice to cut down on the intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 Arunee's shrimp, by comparison, is mild. The shrimp come three to an order, 
and at first glance you will think you are getting a plate of corn dogs. Never 
mind. The shrimp have merely been enveloped with glass noodles, minced chicken 
and spices before being plunged into hot oil for frying. 
</P>
<P>
 The tom yum kai may be the best I've tasted anywhere. It's a classic Thai soup 
made with chicken, coconut milk, lemon grass and other magical ingredients, and 
the trick is to make it rich without obscuring the chicken flavor of the stock 
it's based on. This soup clicks on all cylinders; it's rich, complex and full 
of exotic flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Thais are fond of cold salads layered with hot cooked meats, which must have 
contributed to that trend which surfaced big-time here in California during the 
last decade. Thai beef salad is well known, so why not try yum ped (duck salad) 
instead? Some may find it a bit sweet, because of a sugary dressing, but the 
generous quantity of spicy shredded duck meat gives it a zesty appeal. Another 
salad I like a lot is glass noodle salad, a lighter item made from clear bean 
thread noodles, ground pork, crushed peanuts, romaine lettuce and a sweet hot 
Thai dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 I've tasted more than a dozen good Thai dishes here at Arunee House, seafoods 
(from the oddball crab claw curry to the exemplary kung tod ga tiam -- sauteed 
shrimp in garlic and pepper sauce), noodle dishes (like ba mi , which are egg 
noodles topped with barbecued pork and shredded crab) and the various curries. 
But my experience with the Chinese dishes in this restaurant is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Kung pao chicken is the standard, perhaps a touch sweeter, and more peppery, 
than in your usual Chinese restaurant. I tried the egg foo young with shrimp, 
and enjoyed it. Hot spicy shredded beef Sichuan style is loaded with onion, 
carrot and fresh peas in a zippy sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 And I couldn't help wondering whether the Thai or the Chinese chef prepared 
the crab fried rice, a crossover dish on Southeast Asian menus. (Oh, never 
mind.) Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Arunee House, 10140 Riverside Drive, Toluca Lake.

 SPEED KILLS: Two UC Riverside students died Thursday when an alleged drunk 
driver ran a red light at Corbin Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard (B1), the site of 
a Christmas Day crash that took another life. . . . Despite complaints from 
neighbors and the succession of fatal crashes, police and city officials say 
there is little they can do to make the intersection safer.

 WALKING TALL: They're just 15 and only freshmen, but identical twins Jason and 
Jarron Collins from Granada Hills have transformed Harvard-Westlake High into a 
basketball power. The Wolverines are 13-0 this season (C12). . . . How do you 
distinguish Jason (6-foot-8) from Jarron (6-foot-7)? It's the shoes. Jason 
wears high-tops.

 HOLLYWOOD CALLING: What you see on big and small screens may well have been 
filmed in a neighborhood near you. . . . For decades, the San Fernando, Santa 
Clarita and Antelope valleys have appeared so often in blockbuster movies, TV 
series, videos and commercials that if they don't deserve Oscars for supporting 
roles, somebody should at least give them their very own stars on Hollywood 
Boulevard. See Valley Life! Page 10 
</P>
<P>
 F/X KID: The gory, horrific film "Nightmare on Elm Street" didn't scare Josh 
Brezner as much as inspire him. He enrolled in movie makeup and special effects 
classes, and now the 15-year-old Van Nuys High School sophomore has credits in 
more than 30 productions, including student films, a Hollywood play and a music 
video for Ethyl Meatplow. See Valley Life! Page 3 
</P>
<P>
 THE SHOWS GO ON: The last thing that Van Nuys High needed was to hear that the 
Alex Theatre in Glendale will stage "Mame," the same musical the school plans 
for its spring production. Last year, the school was forced to scrap "Joseph 
and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" when a group with production rights 
refused to give permission. But no problem this year, school officials say.

 THEY'RE BITING: More than 20,000 pounds of rainbow trout -- about 50,000 fish 
-- have been plopped into Lake Casitas in the past few months. And with cooler 
weather, they're moving toward shallows where anglers can hook them. . . . 
"They're all catchable size," Ranger Brent Doan said. "Some are real nice 
fish." . . . Casitas lacks fast-moving tributaries where trout spawn, so they 
have to be stocked. . . . The lake's big bass -- a 21-pounder was once landed 
there -- are biting too, but next month will be better, said Randy King at 
Casitas Boat Rentals. "They'll start feeding like mad. They just go crazy."

 FOREVER ELVIS: The King lives in Ventura County -- on Elvis Presley plates, 
coins, music boxes, watches and dolls. At Ventura's All-Star Celebrity 
Collectibles, owner Mike Thomas even has liquor bottles shaped like Elvis -- 
the svelte, late-'50s Elvis, not the portlier '70s version. . . . "He's the 
biggest, no question," he said -- especially now, with Elvis' 59th birthday on 
Saturday. . . . Raymond Michael Hebel of Moorpark, an Elvis impersonator since 
1972, is booked 200 nights a year. "I never thought it would last this long." 
</P>
<P>
 PUNISHING CRIME: Gov. Pete Wilson's proposal to make crooks spend more time in 
prison is being challenged (A3). . . . In Ventura County, Presiding Superior 
Court Judge Melinda A. Johnson said more mandatory sentences would have one 
certain consequence: more trials. "People have nothing to lose by going to 
trial rather than pleading," she said. "So you'd need more judges, more deputy 
D. A.s. It's very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 SCHOOL NAMES: Controversy is raging in Oxnard over whose name -- if anyone's 
-- should adorn school buildings (B1). . . . Schools in west Ventura County are 
named after such notables as Christa McAuliffe, Will Rogers and Junipero Serra. 
But not one east county school is named for a person. Conejo Unified favors 
tree names -- Aspen, Banyan, Cypress, Maple, Walnut -- while Simi Unified likes 
the view, as in Park View, Mountain View and Valley View. . . . The Somis 
district has just one school: Somis School.

MEXICAN ARMY SEALS OFF HIGHWAYS DURING SEARCH FOR REBEL INDIANS; UNREST: ACTION 
CONCERNS HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS. IN WAKE OF VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT SENDS SUPPLIES TO 
THE CHIAPAS REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mexican soldiers searching for Indian rebels sealed off highways out of a 
southern region's main town Thursday, stirring concern among rights groups 
looking into reports of abuse by troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the day, the army also apparently launched a new offensive against the 
guerrillas. Four airplanes fired rockets near the rural town of Cerro Huitepec, 
three miles southwest of this regional center. There were no immediate reports 
of injuries or damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, however, took steps to build support in Chiapas state, a poor, 
predominantly Mayan region. Officials said 20 tons of rice, beans, powdered 
milk and other food was being flown to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government also promised to strengthen its public works programs 
that build roads, schools and hospitals in the area. Rebels said they began the 
uprising Jan. 1 to highlight the plight of poor Indians in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The presidents of El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua and the president-elect 
of Honduras were to arrive today in Mexico City to discuss the crisis and show 
their solidarity with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurrection has rattled Central Americans in countries newly emerging 
from years of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days after the uprising broke out, rebels were still active in some remote 
areas of Chiapas, a lush mountainous region bordering Guatemala and the 
Pacific, Interior Ministry spokesman Eloy Cantu Segovia reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The village of Chanal east of San Cristobal de las Casas was reported to be in 
rebel hands by seven villagers who fled on foot over the mountains Wednesday. 
There had been conflicting reports on whether Chanal was recaptured by the army 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the seven, Marcelino Gomez Lopez, told El Tiempo newspaper in San 
Cristobal on Thursday that the rebels were not allowing villagers to leave. The 
rebels shot and killed a schoolteacher who tried to escape, Gomez Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The military said 105 people had been killed since the uprising began with 
coordinated attacks on towns in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels from the previously unknown Zapatista National Liberation Army said 
they were fighting for socialism and to improve the lot of Indians who lack 
potable water, food, education and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, soldiers sealed off southbound highways out of San Cristobal, the 
region's main town. Helicopters hovered overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fighting has been south and east of San Cristobal. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavily armed troops guarded the main square in the colonial town of 80,000 
people, about 450 miles southeast of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 An Associated Press correspondent reported no untoward events Thursday along 
the one highway open into San Cristobal from Tuxtla Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 San Cristobal and Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, were the only 
places accessible in the region to reporters and independent human rights 
observers, who expressed concern about the army's move. 
</P>
<P>
 "If security reasons make it necessary to seal off areas, it should be 
explained and should be temporary. Otherwise it raises concerns about . . . 
violations," said Juan Mendez, executive director of Human Rights 
Watch-Americas, an organization monitoring rights violations in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas sent his top human rights official to the battle zones to investigate 
possible army abuses. Jorge Madrazo, chief of the government-run National Human 
Rights Commission, arranged Thursday to start taking complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we would be calling on the Mexican government to allow both the press 
and an impartial human rights investigation to take place," Mendez said by 
phone from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said his group was concerned particularly about two incidents: the apparent 
execution-style killings of rebels in Ocosingo, site of the fiercest fighting, 
and the deaths of about 17 people whose bodies bore battered faces and bullet 
holes in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peasant and Agricultural Workers Center, an organization independent of 
the government, reported meanwhile that the army arrested five of its leaders 
bound for a meeting Wednesday with government officials in Tuxtla Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 It said in a news release that their whereabouts were unknown and expressed 
concern for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The naked bodies of three men and a young girl killed while driving out of San 
Cristobal remained unclaimed in a chapel in the general cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 The local newspaper El Tiempo said it knew of three survivors of the van 
shooting incident, a focal point of concern by rights groups. Its reporters 
said at least two of the three were unconscious, that all were civilians and 
were in a military hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the daily El Universal said a message purportedly sent by the 
rebels said they were organizing an urban front to fight the idle rich 
throughout Mexico. The note was left in a movie theater bathroom, it said.

BROTHER'S KEEPER; MAN SAYS HE TOOK TWIN'S SPOT IN JAIL, ARMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County jailers were taken aback in July when they discovered that a 
man serving a six-month sentence for an Oxnard spousal-abuse case was not the 
batterer -- but his identical twin brother. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out not to be the first time that the two brothers have made such a 
switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Anderson, 43, now says he has done jail time three other times for twin 
brother Ronald Anderson. And more than 20 years ago, Donald says, he even took 
his brother's place in the U.S. Army so his brother could enjoy life as a 
civilian. 
</P>
<P>
 While identical twins often amuse themselves by trading places in social 
situations, one expert on twins called the story of the Anderson brothers 
unprecedented, saying he has never heard an account of a set of twins actually 
carrying an identity swap behind bars or into uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, Donald Anderson went to Korea in place of his brother, he said. No 
one was ever the wiser to any of the schemes the twins have pulled off in the 
past three decades, according to Donald -- until last July when Ventura County 
authorities finally discovered they had the wrong twin serving the six-month 
jail term. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the questions for the twins are plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would anyone serve someone else's jail terms, let alone military duty? How 
could one twin even allow the other one to do such a favor? And how did the 
twins get away with their deeds for so long? 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge asked me why I did this, and I said my twin needed help," Donald 
Anderson told The Times. "Not only am I talking about this now, but I am doing 
all the things I do because I love him." 
</P>
<P>
 The twins have nine other brothers and sisters, but their father, William 
Anderson, 76, said his two identical sons have the closest relationship in the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, who lives in a senior citizens facility in Oxnard, also said the 
twins' willingness to help each other has not always been a two-way street. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald -- who has had troubles with the law himself over the years -- 
typically ends up bailing Ronald out of difficult situations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he has always looked out for him," the father said of Donald, "and he 
still does." 
</P>
<P>
 It appears, though, that Donald Anderson won't be able to bail Ronald out of 
his most recent predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell sentenced Ronald to 14 
years in state prison Wednesday in connection with the case that first exposed 
the twins' jail switch. 
</P>
<P>
 The case originated on July 19, when police said Ronald jumped from behind a 
gate near the Stern Lane home of his estranged wife, Brenda, and choked the 
woman into unconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Police caught Ronald shortly after the attack, but were bewildered. Ronald 
Anderson, they thought, was already in the county jail serving a six-month 
sentence for an earlier assault on his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 How could he be in two places at once? Easy, a friend of the Andersons told 
officers. His twin brother had turned himself in at the Port Hueneme police 
station four days earlier under Ronald's name. 
</P>
<P>
 When his brother surrendered, jail officials had fingerprinted Donald 
Anderson, but did not believe they had any reason to run a check on the prints, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities released Donald Anderson from jail, but charged Ronald with 
attempted murder, spousal battery and robbery because he took his wife's purse 
after choking her. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted the man on each of the counts, and Superior Court Judge 
Charles W. Campbell on Wednesday sentenced him to the maximum prison sentence: 
14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In two separate interviews after the sentencing, Donald Anderson lamented his 
twin's fate and expressed a desire to serve the 14 years for him if he could. 
</P>
<P>
 Jail officials would not allow Ronald to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Anderson said he has served three other jail terms for his twin and 
spent six months in three different cities in Korea for him in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An expert on twin relationships said it is not unusual for identical twins to 
pull off switches. But Niels Waller, director of the California Twins Registry 
at UC Davis, said the Anderson case appears to be extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard many, many stories of twins switching classes in high school and 
switching girlfriends and boyfriends," said Waller, who is trying to track down 
every set of twins in the state for his most recent project. "But never 
switching for jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts consider the kinship between twins to be the closest relationship 
humans can have, Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one dies, the grief that is experienced by a co-twin is more profound 
than the grief that twin experiences with the loss of a spouse or child," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anderson twins have lived in Ventura County since about 1979, according to 
court records. Ronald Anderson was the first to come to the county when he 
landed a job as a jet mechanic at the Point Mugu naval station. 
</P>
<P>
 The twins and the other nine Anderson children were born and raised in 
inner-city Philadelphia. Their mother, Mary, was a homemaker and father William 
was a self-employed mover and hauler. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Anderson said he and Ronald began switching identities as early as 
grade school. Donald said the tricks were harmless, such as switching classes 
without their teachers and classmates catching on. 
</P>
<P>
 It was shortly after their mother died in the mid-1960s that the twins started 
to land in trouble with school and law-enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Donald Anderson was sent to a boys' reformatory school for 
several months at that time after hitting a boy with a beer bottle for 
allegedly threatening Ronald. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aggressive and a hardhead, and I have a bad temper," Donald acknowledged. 
"That's why most of our friends would call me the evil twin and he's the good 
twin. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ran into him, he would say excuse me. If you ran into me, you would 
have trouble on your hands. I'm not going to let anybody take advantage of me. 
He didn't see it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10th grade, the brothers left home and rented a room together. "We 
shined shoes and took orders at the market, always together," Donald recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 After they finished high school, however, Ronald Anderson decided to go out on 
his own and joined the Army. Donald says he was too stubborn and did not want 
to take orders, so he did not follow his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Anderson finished basic training and came home for a 30-day leave 
before heading off to Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before Ronald was scheduled to leave, he told Donald he did not want 
to go. He wanted to stay home and hang around the neighborhood with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I thought he had an excellent chance to get out of the ghetto," said 
Donald, who had become somewhat envious of his brother's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald was scheduled to be a helicopter mechanic in Korea, and Donald 
considered himself a back-yard mechanic anyway. So he offered to take Ronald's 
place in the Army, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'Well, I want to go. Let me try.' He thought it was a joke," 
Donald said. "I didn't care if I got caught or not. It would have been better 
than hanging on the street corners." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Anderson said his brother agreed to the deal and used a broomstick to 
teach him Army rifle drills. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, he told me how to tell an officer, how to tell a lieutenant, 
captains, colonels, and how to salute," Donald remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Donald showered, shaved, cut his hair short and dressed for 
the Army -- in full uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 As Donald was leaving the house to embark on his new career, his father sat at 
their kitchen table and sipped a cup of coffee. The elder Anderson realized 
what his sons were up to and did not approve of the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always told them, just don't get caught," the father said Thursday in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Anderson said he spent two weeks in orientation in Seattle and stopped 
in Japan as well before arriving in Seoul, Korea, where he exchanged currencies 
and got various shots for diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the job with the Army's 55th Aviation Missile Command, he said he rose 
to the position of a crew chief of the helicopter unit and was well-accepted by 
the brass. Some officers, he said, liked him so much that they even escorted 
him into clubs for noncommissioned officers. He said he was also a member of 
the company basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got there, I was a helper on the crew," Donald said. "When the guy who 
showed me what to do left, I was in charge." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the only rough time he had was when he would bump into people who had 
gone to basic training with his twin brother. But nobody ever suspected the 
switch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors said they confirmed that Ronald Anderson was 
supposed to have been serving a tour of duty during the time that Donald claims 
he was actually in the service. 
</P>
<P>
 An Army spokeswoman said there is little the service can do about the 
situation now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying he didn't do it," Debbie Parker, the spokeswoman in 
Washington, D.C., said when told of Donald's story. "But what I am saying is, 
if he did do it, we wouldn't know about it" unless he was caught and tried for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Article 83 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice prohibits false 
impersonation in the service. It is punishable by a dishonorable discharge, 
forfeiture of all pay and allowances and five years' confinement, according to 
the uniform code. 
</P>
<P>
 But Donald said he is speaking out now because the statute of limitations on 
such an offense has run out. Parker confirmed that as true. She said the 
limitation for prosecuting false impersonation is five years. 
</P>
<P>
 After the service, Donald Anderson said he served a two-month jail sentence in 
Philadelphia for his brother. He also said he was arrested and thrown in jail 
after he came to Ventura County for traffic tickets his brother had gotten in 
his name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did the time, without ever telling authorities it was really his 
brother who was using his identification. For that matter, Donald added, he has 
also done jail time in Ventura County on his own behalf -- after a recent petty 
theft conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest case of switched identities, Donald Anderson said he checked 
himself into the County Jail for his brother because Ronald was experiencing 
marital difficulties that had led him to abuse drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Anderson had been ordered to turn himself into the jail on June 14 for 
the spousal-abuse conviction. But Donald said his brother had no intentions of 
doing so. Donald said he checked into the jail without Ronald's knowledge 
because he saw his brother was in trouble and did not want authorities looking 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took my brother's place because he had all these problems," said Donald, 
who has now moved into an apartment across the street from the jail in Ventura 
to be closer to his brother. "My brother has never been in jail (for a long 
time). I've been in jail. I could handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have speculated that Donald agreed to go to jail so his brother 
could have an alibi when he attempted to kill his wife on July 19. Brenda 
Anderson could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no plot to kill her," Donald said. "I love my sister-in-law, for 
one thing. I would never hurt her." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the judge should have given him the 14-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if I could take my twin's place now, I would do it."

D.A. WON'T CHARGE LATINO LEADER IN RENT CASE; OXNARD: OFFICIAL SAYS TEACHER 
WILLIAM TERRAZAS JR. DID NOT BREAK LAWS WHEN ALLEGEDLY COLLECTING SIDE PAYMENTS 
FROM A DOZEN TENANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Oxnard high school teacher and Latino leader, expelled from a federal 
rent-subsidy program for allegedly exploiting poor tenants, will not be charged 
criminally by county prosecutors, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. William Redmond said William Terrazas Jr., 44, did not 
break state theft or extortion laws when allegedly collecting side payments 
from a dozen tenants in El Rio and Nyeland Acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Renters who maintained that Terrazas solicited payments beyond those allowed 
in federal contracts told investigators that the landlord either was 
non-threatening or that they were unsure about whether he threatened them with 
eviction, Redmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrazas, a Channel Islands High School teacher and El Rio resident, did not 
return telephone calls Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But a top official for a Latino advocacy group that honored Terrazas as an 
educator last year, welcomed the district attorney's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a positive move in that it puts this behind him and allows him 
to continue his good work with young people and in developing leadership in our 
community," said Marcos Vargas, executive director at El Concilio del Condado 
de Ventura. "He has continued to be very vigilant in his work with young 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Terrazas denied last year ever soliciting side payments and said state and 
federal inquiries were the result of racial bias and jealousy stemming from his 
success as an activist teacher and real estate developer in the unincorporated 
communities of El Rio and Nyeland Acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a successful Chicano doing good and everybody wants to screw you 
over," he said. "And they find every technicality to get you. . . . I feel 
racially harassed on this." 
</P>
<P>
 While local prosecutors said they had no viable criminal case, a federal 
investigation of Terrazas' rental practices is proceeding, according to Gale 
Galvan, assistant regional inspector general for investigations in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Galvan said his office delayed action against Terrazas until county 
prosecutors made a decision on state charges. "We didn't want to run into a 
dual prosecution," he said.

 Federal investigators -- accompanied by Redmond -- submitted their case to the 
U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles on Thursday. A decision on whether to 
charge Terrazas with housing law violations probably will not be made for 
several weeks, Galvan said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a felony for a landlord in a federally subsidized housing program to 
accept payments greater than stipulated in lease contracts, unless the side 
payments are disclosed to housing authorities, Galvan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Side payments undercut the government's goal of subsidizing the rent of poor 
people so they have more money for other essentials, federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Area Housing Authority of Ventura County, with which Terrazas 
enrolled up to 17 houses until mid-1993, said all of Terrazas' dwellings have 
been purged from the program because of repeated complaints of side payments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Terrazas was the first landlord to be expelled in the authority's 20-year 
history, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a tenants' lawyer confirmed that Terrazas has paid an undisclosed 
amount to four former renters who claimed he collected nearly $20,000 in side 
payments over six years ending in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit settled in September, four former tenants claimed that they had 
paid Terrazas $8,294, $7,826, $2,303 and $950, respectively, in side payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Three former tenants paid the extra rents "under duress and threat of 
eviction," the lawsuit contended. The fourth tenant neither read nor spoke 
English and believed Terrazas when he said the extra payments were required 
under rental contracts, the lawsuit claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lawsuit's been settled and the terms are confidential," said the tenants' 
lawyer, Barbara Macri-Ortiz, of Channel Counties Legal Services in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 She confirmed payments to her clients, but declined to say whether they were 
large or small. Terrazas' attorney in the case, David L. Shain, could not be 
reached Thursday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrazas has said he became a landlord by buying or building about 30 houses 
worth $5 million since 1978. He said he bought his first house for $27,000 just 
after getting a general contractor's license 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 County records show that Terrazas still owns six houses even after a series of 
forced sales and foreclosures during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Terrazas' houses have drawn attention from county code enforcement 
officers, who said he illegally converted garages into rentals and added rooms 
to existing houses without permits. Terrazas has said those alterations already 
existed when he bought the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 To forestall the filing of misdemeanor criminal charges by the county 
counsel's office last year, Terrazas agreed to eliminate the illegal dwellings 
and bring all of his houses up to county standards, officials said. He has 
since lost three of the five houses with code violations to foreclosure, said 
county zoning enforcement officer Joan Neuhaus. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations against Terrazas run counter to his reputation as an 
innovative educator at Channel Islands High School in Oxnard, where he teaches 
English-as-a-Second-Language students to have pride in their native culture and 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Terrazas, in fact, was one of five Ventura County Latinos honored a year ago 
by El Concilio for leadership  
</P>
<P>
 Terrazas, a Channel Islands teacher since 1973, was praised for starting a 
student group that serves as a statewide model for improving the academic 
success of minority students, and for involving parents in their children's 
education.

NAMING SCHOOLS NO LONGER EASY

 At a recent Oxnard School District board meeting, several parents rose to 
demand that the trustees name the district's next school for a recently 
deceased Oxnard woman. 
</P>
<P>
 At another meeting, a school employee asked the board to name a new gymnasium 
for a retired Oxnard teacher. And on Wednesday a second group of parents added 
to the list of potential names an Oxnard man who had become a role model for 
neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
 By the board's regular meeting Wednesday night, the trustees decided that 
rather than debating the issue, they would transfer the task of naming the 
school to a separate committee of 25 parents, teachers and school staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The job of naming schools and buildings, said board President Jim Suter, had 
"gotten totally out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole issue has become a distraction to what we're supposed to be 
doing," Suter said. 
</P>
<P>
 By leaving the naming process to a committee, several members said, the 
political heat generated by the selection process would be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has really become a political hot potato," district Supt. Norman Brekke 
said. "At least if they leave it with a committee, you have to believe the 
decision will meet with a substantial body of support within the community. But 
I'm sure no matter what is decided, someone will be offended." 
</P>
<P>
 The tension surrounding the naming of buildings and schools has never been so 
high, according to longtime board member Jack Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the board named schools without much debate, Fowler said. He said 
the board met no resistance when it renamed Seaport School to Christa McAuliffe 
School in 1986 after McAuliffe died in the explosion of the space shuttle 
Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler said the same was true of the recently opened Emily Ritchen School, 
named for an Oxnard librarian in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Suter said, the naming of the Frank School, which will open in August, 
was politically benign. 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed since then, according to some members of the community, is 
that Latino parents have pushed for greater involvement in the naming process. 
That became evident last year when Juanita School was renamed for Cesar Chavez, 
a move applauded by the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the door was ever open for our participation in the past," said 
Carlos Aguilera, a parent in the district who said Thursday that he plans to 
run for a seat on the school board in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a reluctance on the part of the board to allow the community 
to become involved," Aguilera said. "But we have realized that we have to do 
more than put our foot in the door. We have to kick the door down." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilera and others have suggested that the board consider naming the new 
school in honor of a Latino because the person for whom the school is named can 
serve as a positive role model for Latino children. 
</P>
<P>
 Suter said the people pushing to honor a Latino have "missed the point." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if the person is black or Hispanic or white, we just want to 
name the school after the best person possible," Suter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The naming of the elementary school, which will be built in northeast Oxnard, 
will now turn to the newly formed committee. The gym has been built at the 
Frank Intermediate School, set to open in August. 
</P>
<P>
 But the naming of the gym might never occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the committee to consider whether it would be appropriate to name the 
gym for someone at all," Trustee Dorothie Sterling told the board. "We haven't 
done that in the past and I don't think we want to set the precedent now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process," she said, "has become too difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the job has been left to the committee, Brekke said, the school board 
can focus on more important issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, everyone will allow this debate to pass," Brekke said. "Obviously 
the concern should be with the activities that go on inside our school 
buildings, not the names on them."

AREA SCHOOLS TO BENEFIT FROM BUSINESSES' HAND-ME-DOWNS 
</P>

 Ventura County education officials are collecting used equipment and supplies 
discarded by local businesses and offering them to public schools that are 
strapped for cash but sorely in need of new teaching materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County superintendent of schools office this week launched the 
Classroom Materials Exchange to serve both private and public schools 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Modeled on a successful program in Santa Barbara County, the exchange will 
redistribute to schools unwanted business supplies, ranging from used computers 
to cardboard tubing, county school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want businesses to recycle so we can reuse," said Diana Rigby, curriculum 
director for the county superintendent's office. "It's a wonderful match."  
</P>
<P>
 But county education officials are also using the program to encourage local 
schools to recycle their trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools that have recycling programs can take items from the exchange for free 
while the less environmentally minded will have to pay $5 for each bagful of 
materials. An estimated 90% of the county's public and private schools recycle 
at least some of their trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county superintendent's office began last month to solicit local 
businesses for materials, so far only a handful of companies have come up with 
any offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a truckload of furniture donated by 3M Corp.'s Camarillo plant 
Thursday, the exchange now has only a collection of boxes of telephone cable, 
piles of foam-rubber packing material and cartons of empty film canisters. The 
exchange is located in a room at the county superintendent's office at 
Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But one teacher said she had to rein in her enthusiasm when she and a 
colleague spotted the goods up for grabs at the exchange this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried really hard not to take things that we could not use right away," 
said Suzanne Williamson of Katherine School in Simi Valley. "Teachers have the 
habit of hanging on to things." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said she had to hold herself back when she spotted a box of plastic 
gears that she coveted: "I don't know what I'd use them for." 
</P>
<P>
 But she grabbed some items, including telephone cable donated by Southern 
California Edison Co., that Williamson's team-teacher for the sixth grade plans 
to strip and use for classroom electricity experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real gift because you don't have to go to Radio Shack," Williamson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For science teachers, the exchange comes at a particularly good time, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the state Department of Education issued new guidelines encouraging 
science teachers to spend less classroom time on textbooks and more on hands-on 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, Williamson said, buying all the items required for such 
experiments. "We have all these wonderful new science units but we're a little 
poor as far as the materials go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange can also benefit businesses by providing a tax write-off and 
single drop-off spot for unwanted materials, said George Gunnell, a 3M Corp. 
manager and a member of the nonprofit Ventura County Economic Development 
Assn., which helped county educators set up the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the furniture that 3M donated Thursday, the company plans to 
contribute several old computers. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the past, 3M let employees bid on such used equipment. Then 
Gunnell began donating old furniture, filing cabinets and other items to 
individual schools around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gunnell said he prefers sending used equipment to an exchange that will 
give all schools access to the goods. "It really helps us in getting it out 
where it belongs without people saying we have favorites here and favorites 
there," he said.

 The Museum of Modern Poodle: Downtown artist Doren Garcia likes poodles well 
enough. But it's their owners he really finds fascinating -- "their bad taste 
especially." Garcia explains: "They sculpt them, they fluff them up, they dye 
them, they put bows on them -- they really turn poodles into organic 
sculptures." 
</P>
<P>
 So great is Garcia's interest in the breed that he has amassed a collection of 
"1,000 examples of bad taste in poodles," which he will unveil to the world 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his most treasured pieces of kitsch is a set of poodle boot trees -- 
yes, poodle-shaped devices to maintain the shape of boots. "It's hard to 
imagine how someone could come up with the idea of making his fortune by 
manufacturing poodle boot trees for America," the canine curator observed. 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, the Modern Poodle has numerous other relics. Garcia will also 
set out his "spaghetti poodles" (figurines with ceramic hairs), poodle 
broaches, poodle lamps and poodle liquor bottle covers between 6 and 9 p.m. in 
his loft at 1401 S. Santa Fe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit is sponsored by the Los Angeles Cacophony Society, a group of 
artists and gagsters, which is inviting the public to celebrate "the spirit of 
the nasty-tempered little specimen of canine topiary." 
</P>
<P>
 No pets allowed.

 We'd like to hear from the former occupants first: The Times received a copy 
of The Trans Times, a newsletter for those cryogenically inclined -- that is, 
interested in having their bodies frozen after death. It carries this ad: 
</P>
<P>
 "Trans Time has two used cryogenic storage containers for sale, which we have 
used for long-term storage of human patients." Prices: $5,000 and $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-priced model is "a two-patient unit." 
</P>

 Breakthrough: a water repellent umbrella. What will science think of 
next?Perry Jaster of West Hills bought an umbrella, whose tag reveals that it 
can even be used to shield its owner from the rain.

</P>
<P>
 L.A. has more poodles, too: In its California-theme edition, the February 
issue of Spy magazine announces that "on the question of San Francisco vs. Los 
Angeles, we feel compelled to advance a minority view and admit that we 
generally like L.A. . . . San Franciscans ridicule Los Angeles as a tasteless, 
sybaritic hellhole where everyone who is anyone drives a red Maserati and 
dates, or is, a blond bimbo. Precisely." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Spy ignores the state's other major municipalities. It sums up 
California's second-largest city thusly: "Farther to the south lies San Diego, 
which has a zoo." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Our theory is that they were drawn there by a great sucking sound: Art Vinsel 
noticed that the San Pedro branch of the city library has two copies of "Not 
For Sale at Any Price" filed in the science fiction section, listed 
alphabetically by the author's last name, Perot. miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 In the recently published "Rivers in the Desert," about L.A. pioneer William 
Mulholland, author Margaret Leslie Davis notes in passing that L.A. Dist. Atty. 
Asa Keyes was convicted of bribery and sentenced to 14 years in San Quentin in 
1929. Keyes was released after 32 months and, a week later, "reported to work 
at his new job as a used-car salesman at a Pasadena car dealership."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LANCASTER; FAMILY SUES 
BANK OVER SLAYING AT TELLER MACHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wife and children of a man gunned down at a Bank of America teller machine 
in Lancaster are suing the financial institution for $60 million, alleging the 
machine was installed in a location that invited crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed in Lancaster Superior Court on behalf of Verena Herzog, her 
son, Brenden, 17, and her daughter, Heidi, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Hans Christian Herzog, 46, was killed March 5. Two men, Christopher A. Mann 
and Wesley Harper, were arrested in the slaying and are awating trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Herzogs are not the first to sue a bank after the killing of a family 
member at an ATM. Last summer, the parents of a pregnant women slain at an ATM 
in Sherman Oaks filed suit sued for unspecified damages. In April, the family 
of an Encino man killed while using an ATM settled a wrongful death suit 
against Wells Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest suit alleges that the Lancaster ATM was in a poor location, at the 
back of the bank where it cannot be seen from the street. Since Herzog's death, 
the bank has hired a security guard to watch the machines.

 Reacting to the arrest of a suspect in the Polly Klaas slaying, some 
politicians have thrown their support behind an initiative proposed for the 
November ballot that would send "three-time losers" to prison for life. Under 
the initiative, anyone convicted of two prior "violent" or "serious" felonies 
could be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison if they were convicted of a 
third felony, whether the third crime was violent or not. Gov. Pete Wilson last 
month suggested legislators adopt similar measures, which would eliminate the 
need for the voter initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should criminals convicted of three felonies, regardless of whether the crimes 
were violent, be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison?  
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Zedar E. Broadous, president of the San Fernando Valley chapter of 
the NAACP: In this day and age we have a great influx of crime and violence. We 
find bandages, but we don't do anything to solve the root problems. I hear 
about building more prisons. I hear nothing about building more schools or 
upgrading our schools. True enough, criminals should be dealt with. . . . But 
as a society, we continue to do things that give people that feeling of instant 
relief by saying, "Let's built more penitentiaries." If we continue in that 
vein, we'll be a police state. We're not dealing with the root problem and that 
begins in oureducation system. It's a bad use of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Lungren, attorney general: I have given my complete and unqualified 
support for the passage of the "three strikes -- you're out" initiative, which 
will put the most violent, repeat offenders in California where they belong -- 
behind bars. We must end the senseless policy of allowing chronic violent 
criminals who have committed felony after felony back on the streets to again 
commit felony after felony. It's time to seal shut the revolving door in our 
criminal justice system which has allowed these criminals to inflict untold 
agony on victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Block, Los Angeles County sheriff: I support reasonable and 
appropriate actions that will contribute to making our communities safer places 
in which to live and work. This includes placing additional public safety 
resources on our streets, educating our youth, and toughening sentencing laws 
aimed at violent criminals who have repeatedly victimized our citizenry. A 
person who has been convicted of felony crimes on three separate occasions 
probably has had a number of previous convictions for lesser crimes. Such a 
person is clearly a career criminal who refrains from criminal activity only 
when incarcerated. Removal from society is a reasonable expectation on the part 
of those who carry out their daily lives consistent with the legitimate rules 
established by society. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Silverstein, Sherman Oaks resident and staff attorney for the American 
Civil Liberties Union: I think that we can't solve the problem of crime or even 
violent crime by trying to store more people and warehouse them in prisons. One 
reason is because this is too expensive and that it doesn't work. The prison 
population in California went up six times since 1977. It increased from 19,000 
in 1977 to 113,000 in 1993. It has not affected the crime problem. But it costs 
so much money. Measures like this require building more and more prisons. It 
takes money away from crime prevention measures like education, job training, 
housing and medical care. . . . The idea that we're dealing with nonviolent 
criminals this way only exaggerates what I think of as a non-productive 
measure. Dealing with nonviolent offenders by putting them in warehouse prisons 
rather than spending on something that would prevent them from committing the 
crime is too expensive and doesn't work.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TEACHERS, STAFF PITCH IN TO CLEAN CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jay Porter spent the better part of Thursday morning wiping grime, cleaning 
screens and dusting keyboards on 87 computers in a lab at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 And the part-time accounting teacher had an even grittier job planned for his 
afternoon shift. He volunteered to remove graffiti from a men's bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not like dirty sayings in front of my nose" in the bathroom, Porter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter was one of about 75 teachers, staff members and administrators at 
Ventura College who volunteered to help custodians spiff up the campus in time 
for the opening of the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the work was completed Thursday during a campuswide cleanup day. 
Instead of processing paperwork, the college's staff waxed floors, washed 
windows, weeded flower beds and changed dirty filters on machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left my computer at 9 a.m. and came out into the sunshine," said Pattie 
McPhun, a college secretary, as she raked leaves from shrubbery in front of the 
administrative center. "It's not a bad way to spend the day." 
</P>
<P>
 The light work will help maintenance staff members prepare for the start of 
classes Jan. 18, said Robert Forest, director of maintenance and operations. 
His crew of 50 gardeners, custodians and warehouse workers has been trimmed by 
at least seven positions over the past five years due to budget cuts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest and college Vice President Ruth Hemming also hoped to foster team 
spirit among teachers, administrators and clerical staff members who run 
various campus departments.

 "It's good college relations for the staff to get outside and see what other 
departments are doing," Hemming said. "It makes people feel better about their 
workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College has held several similar cleaning days in the past with great 
success, Hemming said. This is the first time the Ventura campus has tried the 
volunteer program, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Cajiuat was one of a handful of students who also pitched in. The 
25-year-old liberal arts major works part time at the circulation desk in the 
college library, but Thursday he was washing windows. 
</P>
<P>
 While others said they volunteered for the jobs out of a feeling of campus 
pride and civic duty, Cajiuat's motive had more to do with peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw everyone else working and I felt kind of guilty not doing it," he said. 
"So I grabbed some window cleaner." KAY SAILLANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY ACTS TO SLOW TRAFFIC AT BUSY 
CROSSWALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to improve safety at a school crosswalk on a busy Simi Valley street, 
the city has agreed to install a warning sign and re-stripe the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 A traffic signal may also be installed on Royal Avenue near Madera Elementary 
School, said Bill Golubics, city traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a substantial amount of traffic going through there," Golubics said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We've looked at the area and a signal would probably help slow down traffic 
quite a bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golubics said if the area's Neighborhood Council decides that a signal is 
needed, the proposal will go before the City Council for consideration in the 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the city is installing a second school-crossing sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is also re-striping the roadway to reduce four lanes of traffic to 
two at the crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements are being made in response to complaints by parents, who 
submitted a petition with 400 signatures to the city last month asking for a 
safer crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a crossing guard patrols the crosswalk during school hours, parents 
say motorists buzz pass the guard's large stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it is now, it's a death trap," said Joe Morris as he waited for his 
son Joseph to finish class Thursday. "I've seen cars brush up against the 
crossing guard and then just keep going," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Parks, assistant superintendent of education services, praised the 
city's action in improving the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there have been some close calls," Parks said. "I think the additional 
sign will help catch people's eye and warn them to slow down." SARA CATANIA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TAKASUGI OUTLINES LEGISLATIVE GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) on Thursday unveiled his 1994 
legislative agenda and kicked off his reelection campaign with a $50-a-plate 
fund-raising dinner Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Takasugi during his announcement was Haley Barbour, national chairman 
of the Republican Party.Barbour was in Ventura County to speak at Takasugi's 
fund-raiser at Howard Johnson's Hotel on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering his second year representing the 37th Assembly District, Takasugi 
told reporters before the dinner that if reelected he will push government to 
embrace new business, provide incentives for creating new jobs and sustain the 
area's agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be part of what will be known as the California Comeback," Takasugi 
said. "I think we've taken some important steps, but our job isn't through. We 
still have a long road ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi said that he will push for legislation to provide tax credits for 
businesses that create new jobs, eliminate the possibility of parole for 
convicted murderers and enhance penalties for convicted arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Oxnard mayor and councilman said that he would seek to make the 
state's schools systems return to curricula emphasizing basic reading, writing 
and mathematical skills and that he would sponsor legislation that would 
provide tax credits to citizen-based anti-crime organizations like Crime 
Stoppers.  
</P>
<P>
 Barbour called Takasugi's goals challenging but achievable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the kind of legislation that Nao is proposing is exactly what people 
in this county and people across the nation are looking for," Barbour said. "I 
don't think that what he is proposing will be easy, but I think it's do-able."

COUNCIL ACCEPTS PLAN TO END BEACH FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Port Hueneme City Council has accepted a task force proposal to end a 
controversial beach maintenance fee that some property owners said amounted to 
a tax on their ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the council unanimously agreed to merge the beach maintenance 
assessment district with a citywide park district.The proposal would lower 
taxes of property owners within the beach district by as much as $150 a year, 
but increase taxes on other residents by about $18 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Port Hueneme raised $457,500 in revenues from the two special 
assessment districts to help maintain public parks and the beach. Of that, the 
park district generated $300,000 and the beach district $157,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Blue Ribbon Task Force felt there was a benefit citywide from Hueneme 
Beach, and that all citizens should participate" in paying for their upkeep, 
said Councilman Dorill B. Wright, chairman of the citizen task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "The net effect is a spreading, if you will, of part of the cost of 
maintaining the beach across the rest of the city," Wright said. PATRICK

DEVELOPMENT PLAN CONCERNS NEIGHBORS

<P>
 Some property owners and businesses in the northern Ventura Avenue area are 
worried about a proposed large housing and business development that could 
greatly change the character of the city's old industrial neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In a public meeting Thursday night, property owners and businesses expressed 
concerns about a project that would add 330 residential units, a park, business 
offices and industrial buildings to the industrial neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no where to go," said Henry Iverson, who heads a plumbers' union that 
owns a lot in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 The concerns are over a joint project proposed by two landowning families and 
Kinko's -- the national copy service company headquartered in the neighborhood. 
The Neel and Huntsinger families and Kinko's are asking the Ventura City 
Council to rezone their property from heavy industrial use to light industrial 
and residential zoning so they can proceed with the mixed-use development. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three landowners are also asking the city to rezone some of the 
neighboring properties to make the heavily industrial neighborhood more 
consistent with their proposal to infuse the area with houses and business 
offices. That request has angered some neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why they can't go ahead and do what they want to do and 
develop their property without affecting our properties," said Bill Kendall, a 
partner of a real estate management company that owns property nearby. PEGGY Y.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; 1 KILLED, 1 HURT IN CRASH INTO OCEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 One man died and another was injured Thursday night when their car went out of 
control on Pacific Coast Highway near Mugu Rock and plunged 150 feet off a 
steep embankment and into the ocean, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-door car was headed north on Pacific Coast Highway at about 65 m.p.h. 
when the driver attempted to pass another car, California Highway Patrol Sgt. 
Dave Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving back to the right, the driver lost control, hit the side of the 
mountain and the car spun back across the highway toward the ocean, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car crossed the eight-foot gravel shoulder and hurtled down the 
embankment, landing upside-down in the ocean, Price said. That section of 
Pacific Coast Highway has no guardrail. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the driver, identified as a 24-year-old Isla Vista man, managed 
to climb out of the car. He was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center in 
Oxnard where he was listed in stable condition, a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other man was pronounced dead when rescue workers reached the car. His 
name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP closed southbound lanes of the highway for about an hour as a tow 
truck pulled the car from the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness, who arrived at the scene about 8 p.m., just after the car went 
over the side, said he was amazed that one man survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hell of an accident," said Jose Reynoeso, 36, of Los Angeles. "When 
I pulled over I looked down and saw the car had flipped over. It was awful."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: LOCKWOOD VALLEY; 14 EMACIATED HORSES TAKEN FROM 
RANCH

<P>
 Authorities removed 14 emaciated horses from a Lockwood Valley ranch after 
receiving a tip that the animals were being starved, an animal shelter official 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the sickly animals died shortly after workers from the Humane Society 
of Ventura County in Ojai and deputies with the sheriff's mounted patrol 
rounded them up at the Warner Ranch in the remote valley, said Jolene Hoffman, 
director of the Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
 One horse had a heart attack and the other had to be destroyed after it 
suffered a seizure, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter workers also removed 11 Persian cats and three Labrador dogs that 
appeared to be neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman would not release the name of the animals' owner, but said it is a 
woman in her 70s. If the woman cannot prove that she properly cared for the 
animals, the Humane Society will ask her to transfer ownership to the shelter, 
Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the owner refuses to sign over the animals, the Humane Society will ask the 
district attorney's office to file felony animal cruelty and neglect charges 
against her, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman apparently lives alone in a mobile home on the property, Hoffman 
said. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY TO FETE CITY HALL'S 20TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Charles Manson and Jack Nicholson spent time there. So did Ma Duncan, who had 
hired killers to kidnap and murder her daughter-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it houses hundreds of Ventura employees who conduct city business from it 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 The building at the top of California Street served as the Ventura County 
Courthouse from 1912 to 1969, when it was bought by the city of Ventura. After 
refurbishing, it opened in 1974 as Ventura's City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, city officials will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the move 
into the national historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 The building at 501 Poli St. first drew national attention in 1958 during the 
trial of Ma Duncan, who was convicted of killing her daughter-in-law. In the 
late 1960s, convicted mass slayer Manson was arraigned at the building on drunk 
driving charges. In 1989, actor Nicholson filmed part of "The Two Jakes" there. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, which sits atop a hillside in downtown Ventura, commands a view 
of the city and the ocean four blocks south. It houses most of the city's 
offices, many of which will be open Saturday so residents have the opportunity 
to talk with city officials, city spokeswoman Carol Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's exterior design features four massive, fluted Doric columns and 
glazed terra-cotta tiles. The architectural style has been described as 
neoclassic revival, Roman Doric and French Renaissance. On the ground floor, 
Roman arched windows are topped by whimsical friar's head keystones. 
</P>
<P>
 The foyer walls and floor are made of Carrara marble shipped from Italy, and 
the entry is decorated with a plaster ceiling of scallop shells, garlands of 
fruit and Art Deco lighting fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceremonies will begin at 10:30 a.m. in the atrium on the first floor of City 
Hall, Green said. Music, refreshments and guided tours will be featured. 
Commemorative plates, pins and calendars will be available for purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ceremony will be short and sweet because the purpose is to show off the 
building," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 Festivities are scheduled to last until 2 p.m. For information, call 654-7800.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; RISING LAKE LEVEL SLOWS SPILL CLEANUP 
</P>

 Ground water seeping into McGrath Lake has raised the water level about 18 
inches, preventing work crews from completing the cleanup of the sensitive 
oil-stained habitat, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 State Fish and Game biologist Jim Hardwick said workers had received 
permission to pump water from McGrath Lake into the ocean on the condition that 
the water is pumped from the middle depths of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardwick said there are still significant amounts of oil on the lake surface 
and at the bottom of the lake. But water from the mid-level of the lake was 
tested and approved by water quality experts, he said. Pumping is expected to 
begin by today. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the number of birds reported killed by the 84,000-gallon Bush Oil 
Co. spill climbed to 188, according to state Fish and Game spokesman David 
Blurton. Another 32 birds are being treated for exposure to the thick oil, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, Blurton said six miles of beach extending from the Ventura 
Pier to just north of the Channel Islands Harbor has been declared clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers now are concentrating on one-mile stretches of beach north and south 
of the harbor, where thousands of tar balls were washed ashore in the days 
after the oil leak, Blurton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Excavation work of the ruptured pipeline continued Thursday, as workers along 
Harbor Boulevard removed tons of oil-soaked dirt from both sides of the 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 The road will be closed again today between Gonzales Road and Olivas Park 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Grimes of the U.S. Coast Guard said Thursday that officials from Berry 
Petroleum, which owns Bush Oil, told him the company would abandon the line 
altogether rather than repair the broken pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush Oil officials on Thursday would not confirm or deny that report. JEFF

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; MOTION FILED IN WEATHER TOWER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office on Thursday filed a condemnation motion on half an 
acre of land owned by a woman whose driveway must be crossed for government 
workers to get to the site where they are building a radar tower. 
</P>
<P>
 But the process will be opposed in federal court this morning by attorneys 
representing Agnes Baron, the next-door neighbor of William and Ernestine Kee, 
who leased a patch of land to the federal government to house a 98-foot 
microwave weather-tracking station. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Donna Everett said late Thursday that the condemnation 
applies only to the easement and that Baron will not lose the acreage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States can condemn the property," she said. "The only issue left 
in the lawsuit is just compensation. That means who gets paid and how much." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, attorneys representing the Environmental Coalition of Ojai, actor 
Larry Hagman and upper Ojai resident David Hedman said Thursday they will file 
a federal lawsuit of their own today. 
</P>
<P>
 That litigation will ask a federal judge to issue an injunction stopping 
construction of the weather station until the government completes more 
detailed environmental reviews of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the coalition are concerned that radiation emitted from the new 
radar tower will cause cancer, birth defects or other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, Ventura County Superior Court Judge John J. Hunter removed 
himself from the civil suit between Baron and the Kees after the Kees' attorney 
argued that the judge was prejudiced against his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Baron's legal team won a temporary restraining order that 
prevents the Kees from allowing government workers across Baron's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Frederick A. Jones was given the Superior Court case, but it's expected 
to become moot because of the condemnation action filed Thursday. JEFF McDONALD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cabrillo Marine Aquarium's Science at the Seashore program will conduct a 
tide-pool walk on Sunday beneath the bluffs south of the San Pedro aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 A slide show will be presented before observing the variety of animals that 
may be found in the tide pools, known as Point Fermin Marine Life Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 The creatures include sea urchins, sea hares, anemones, and hermit crabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Strands of kelp and algae undulate in the wave-fed pools. Little sea worms 
hide under the rocks. And some of those bumps on the rocks are barnacles that 
have cemented themselves to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply poking around tide pools and taking in the sea air and ocean views can 
be fun, but experts at the aquarium say it's a lot more enjoyable if you know 
what you're looking at. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-slip shoes and outdoor clothing are recommended for the trek scheduled 
from 1 to 2:30 p.m. over the slippery rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost is $1. Children younger than 13 must be accompanied by an adult. Beach 
parking is $5.50, and limited street parking is available nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Another walk is scheduled for Jan. 29 from 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The aquarium is at 3720 Stephen White Drive, San Pedro.

A TASTE OF THE SOUTH BAY / DINING SPOTS IN YOUR AREA

 In the small, inviting bar of Cafe Pierre in Manhattan Beach, you'll notice a 
poster of Julia Child. The poster, celebrating a dinner held in honor of 
Child's 80th birthday, has many illustrious signatures from the world of French 
gastronomy, including those of super-chefs Paul Bocuse, Marc Meneau and Alain 
Ducasse. Among the proud signatories is Guy Gabriele, chef-owner of the Cafe 
Pierre and one of the chefs of the memorable event. 
</P>
<P>
 The diverse menu, featuring a mixture of French, Italian and Californian 
cuisines, and even a few Mexican influences, mirrors the chef's life. Gabriele 
is of Italian ancestry, but was born and grew up near Nice, on the French 
Riviera, where his family operated a gourmet market. He went on to hotel school 
in Italy and soon ventured to Los Angeles. After earning a master's degree in 
literature, he opened Crepe Pierre in 1977, at the height of the crepe craze. 
The menu eventually evolved beyond crepes, so, in 1980, he changed the name of 
his eatery to Cafe Pierre. 
</P>
<P>
 The pleasant, dimly lighted dining room is lined with prints, many depicting 
French bistro waiters, while fresh flowers adorn the tables. The service is 
prompt and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hors d'oeuvres is sauteed calamari ($6.50), served with red and 
yellow peppers in a white wine, shrimp sauce. Soft polenta ($6.50) is mixed 
with Gorgonzola, mushrooms and roasted garlic. Grilled eggplant ($6.75) has a 
lively seasoning of goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, sweet onions and capers. 
In rainy weather, the French onion soup ($5.95) is warming. A popular main 
course is the roasted chicken Tante Paulette ($12.95), a half bird served on 
mashed potatoes, roasted peppers, garlic and the olive paste tapenade. 
Camarones Tamaulipas ($15.50), is grilled shrimp with a Mexican note: chiles, 
onions, tomatoes, thyme and bay leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch offerings include salad Nicoise ($7.25) and linguine tossed with 
artichokes, garlic, fresh basil, olive oil and Parmesan ($7.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Pierre is at 317 Manhattan Beach Blvd., Manhattan Beach. (310) 545-5252. 
Open Monday through Friday 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and Sunday through Thursday 
from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. MICHAEL

CITY AND COUNTY REACH REDEVELOPMENT ACCORD; THOUSAND OAKS: AGENCY WILL BE 
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT MONEY FOR HOUSING AND OTHER IMPROVEMENT 
PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks and Ventura County officials Thursday reached a tentative 
settlement allowing the city's Redevelopment Agency to pour $120 million into 
building affordable homes and beautifying a downtown corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that the redevelopment program would divert scarce property tax 
dollars from fire protection, flood control and other services, the county had 
threatened to block Thousand Oaks' plans with a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday evening, both city and county officials said that days of intense 
number-crunching had yielded agreement on the most important issues. A few 
minor concerns about the document's language remained to be worked out late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's great news," Thousand Oaks Councilman Alex Fiore said. "I think it's a 
win-win situation for the city and the county. Now we'll be able to go ahead 
and do a lot of nice things." 
</P>
<P>
 With the redevelopment money, the City Council plans to build an auditorium 
for Newbury Park High School and a stadium for Westlake High School. To freshen 
up an aging four-mile stretch of Thousand Oaks Boulevard, the council plans new 
landscaping, sidewalks and other cosmetic changes. 
</P>
<P>
 All the redevelopment funds come from property taxes collected along Thousand 
Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The county receives a base-line amount of taxes, set when the Redevelopment 
Agency was founded in 1979. The city then collects each dollar assessed above 
that figure -- a considerable sum, as property values have risen sharply in the 
last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the agency was established, it has collected roughly $72 million. Of 
that, one-fifth is reserved for affordable housing and another 20% gets 
funneled back to county coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement reached Thursday, the county will continue to receive 
one-fifth of the Redevelopment Agency's receipts for the next year or two. As 
soon as the agency's gross tax income hits $100 million, the county's share 
will jump to 22%. The county's portion will continue to rise in steps, reaching 
36% once the Redevelopment Agency has collected $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel confident that (the county's revenue) is protected," said Marty 
Robinson, the county's deputy chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the Board of Supervisors and City Council, the settlement will 
allow Thousand Oaks to extend the life of its Redevelopment Agency for three 
decades -- until 2023. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the agency will be able to collect $530 million in property taxes 
for local improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the plan to extend the Redevelopment Agency's life 
and issue $120 million in bonds late last year, but needed permission from all 
affected tax-collecting agencies before going ahead. By law, the county had 60 
days to file suit and block the program -- a period that expires Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always better to settle than to deal with the time, effort, expense and 
risk of going to court," Assistant County Counsel Daniel Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 While she agreed that negotiation beats litigation, Mayor Elois Zeanah 
expressed regret that the last obstacle to Thousand Oaks' redevelopment program 
had dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah had voted against extending the Redevelopment Agency's life on the 
grounds that the county general fund needs tax dollars more than Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not good for taxpayers, and it's not good for the city," she said. 
"That area is not blighted, and property taxes should go for more important 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah also blasted the city's plan to issue bonds to generate cash for 
boulevard improvements. "This is not a fiscally conservative policy," she said. 
"It's risky business."

EX-NEWPORT FIRE CAPT. PARRISH DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Parrish, a retired captain of the Newport Beach Fire Department, died 
Wednesday at his home in Long Beach after a one-year bout with cancer. He was 
49. 
</P>
<P>
 Parrish joined the city's Fire Department in 1972 and was promoted to captain 
in 1978, said Capt. A.J. Wagner, who worked with Parrish all that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great firefighter and had a great attitude," Wagner said. "He was 
very fair and level-headed."  
</P>
<P>
 Parrish was known as "the gourmet chef of Station 3" and was famous for making 
birthday cakes for colleagues at the firehouse, Wagner said.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Parrish was elected Firefighter of the Year by his peers and was 
nominated as an overachiever in the Orange County Firefighters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the department in September and officially retired on Dec. 15, Wagner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parrish is survived by his wife, Gina, his son, Tyson, 14, and his sister, 
Wanda Black. 
</P>
<P>
 Services will be conducted at 10 a.m. Monday at Pacific View Memorial Park in 
Newport Beach.

BUENA PARK'S FIRST CITY CLERK DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buena Park's first city clerk, Marguerite G. Courson, who served nearly 30 
years in the position before retiring in 1985, died Monday. Mrs. Courson, who 
lived in La Mirada, was 79. 
</P>
<P>
 She began her work with the city on May 18, 1954, as secretary to the city 
manager.She was appointed on May 15, 1956, to serve as the city's first 
full-time city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Don R. Griffin, a longtime friend of Mrs. Courson, said at the 
close of Monday's City Council meeting -- adjourned in her memory -- that she 
was an "exemplary person" and a true professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, who knew Mrs. Courson for more than 30 years, also described her as a 
"lovable" person and a "deep friend of the community who will be missed a great 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 When she retired, the City Council honored her by naming the building where 
she had worked after her. The building houses the offices of the mayor, City 
Council and city clerk and the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised on the former McNally Ranch, which now is part of La Mirada, 
she married Walter Courson in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Courson's sister and only surviving relative, Daphne Meiers of La Mirada, 
said she had suffered breast cancer the past eight years and then contracted 
bone cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 A service is planned for this morning at 10 a.m. at Rose Hills Mortuary 
Chapel, 3900 S. Workman Mill Road, Whittier.

FORMER SUPERVISOR SCHAEFER MAY RUN AGAIN FOR COUNTY BOARD; ELECTIONS: SHE HAS 
PICKED UP PAPERS FOR THE RACE AND SAYS SHE'LL HAVE 'A STATEMENT IN A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, ousted from office by 
Maria VanderKolk in a tight race four years ago, has taken out papers to run 
for her old seat in the June election. 
</P>
<P>
 County elections officials said Thursday that Schaefer has picked up the forms 
to run for the seat representing the supervisorial district that stretches from 
the Conejo Valley to Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer declined to comment on her actions, saying, "I'll have a statement in 
a couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 But the former supervisor's friends and supporters said Schaefer has been 
considering entering the race since VanderKolk announced several weeks ago that 
she would not seek a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's ready to get back into the world of politics again," said Joan Young, 
owner of Young Realtors in Westlake Village and a longtime friend of 
Schaefer's. "I think Madge did a great job before. I'm thrilled she is 
running." 
</P>
<P>
 The race for VanderKolk's seat is expected to be hotly contested. In addition 
to Schaefer, four other people have taken out papers to seek election. They 
include Thousand Oaks City Councilman Frank Schillo, taxpayer advocate H. Jere 
Robings, and Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council members Ron Stark and J. Paul 
Fredericks. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials caution that although Schaefer and others have taken out 
papers, they still have the option of not entering the race. The candidates 
have until March 11 to file the forms, which require 2,000 signatures or a 
filing fee of nearly $700. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight county positions, including sheriff and district attorney, will be up 
for election this year. Supervisor Vicky Howard plans to seek reelection and so 
far has attracted only one potential challenger, Simi Valley Councilwoman 
Barbara Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing to VanderKolk by fewer than 100 votes, Schaefer -- who is known 
for her quick wit but sometimes quarrelsome manner -- has sought other 
government positions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, she ran against six other Republicans in a primary for the 37th 
Assembly District, which reaches from Thousand Oaks to Oxnard. Schaefer came in 
third -- behind then-Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi, who went on to win the seat, 
and Alan A. Guggenheim, a French emigre who mounted an unexpectedly strong 
campaign with a surge of help from anti-abortion activists. Schaefer received 
6,687 votes -- 19% of those cast in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Schaefer sought appointment to the 1993-94 grand jury, but her 
application was rejected by the group of Superior Court judges who picked the 
19-member panel. 
</P>
<P>
 In a routine background check, district attorney investigators asked 
VanderKolk and Schillo, a Schaefer nemesis from her years on the Thousand Oaks 
City Council, about the former supervisor. Both were asked to fill out a 
questionnaire detailing whether Schaefer should be included on the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo and VanderKolk on Thursday declined to comment on Schaefer's decision 
to take out papers for the supervisorial race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any thoughts at all on that," Schillo said. "If she wants to 
run, that's up to her."

EUROPEAN SUMMIT OF UNCERTAINTY; NATO: AN ALLIANCE IN SEARCH OF A RELATIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia has a historical fear of encirclement. Eastern Europe has a historical 
fear of absorption. Which of these fears, if either, should guide the United 
States as NATO debates whether to enlarge its membership? 
</P>
<P>
 In power-political terms, NATO, an alliance formed to deter Soviet aggression, 
would seem to be made only the stronger by the addition of new allies lying so 
near to Russia itself. The Eastern European nations themselves are eager for 
NATO membership. Lithuania has already requested it. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity to enlarge NATO, moreover, may be fading. Last August Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin said that he would not object to NATO membership for 
Poland or the Czech Republic. In October, having foiled a coup attempt in 
Moscow, he cautioned Western European leaders against expanding NATO. 
Wednesday, tilting toward the electorally resurgent Russian right wing, he 
denounced Lithuania's NATO bid in the Cold War language of veiled threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the arguments of power politics, however, stand those of 
psycho-politics. If expanding NATO to bring it to the Russian border would 
strengthen the psychological appeal of right-wing extremists like Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky, then NATO should not be expanded. Russians like Zhirinovsky, yes, 
must be treated as the enemy, but Russia as a whole must not be so treated lest 
the prophecy become self-fulfilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of these two courses is without risk, and it is unsettling that so 
basic a matter of U.S. foreign policy seems to have been postponed to the very 
eve of next week's NATO summit. That said, the Clinton Administration has 
wisely recognized that time is, to a point, on NATO's side. If the second 
policy is adopted and fails, there will still be time to shift to the first 
policy, for Russia is economically incapable of rapid rearmament. The 
Partnership for Peace that NATO will adopt is thus, by design, an ambiguous 
policy. It begins an association between NATO and Eastern Europe that can 
mature into either a collective security policy including Russia or a defensive 
alliance against Russia. Events will determine which option prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 Among NATO's achievements is that it has kept its members from going to war 
with one another. An expanded NATO may eventually have that effect in an 
enlarged sphere. Without Russian backing, NATO has defaulted in the Balkans. 
With Russia in the fold, a NATO changed from a conventional military alliance 
to a continental police force may be able to do better in comparable crises 
that surely lie ahead. The moment, in short, is one of confusion and danger -- 
as the resignation Thursday of yet other veteran U.S. State Department official 
over President Clinton's Bosnia policy suggests -- but also one of considerable 
gravity and opportunity.

LANDING ON A BEACH OF PREJUDICE; MARINES ADMIT ERRORS IN THE OUTRAGEOUS CASE OF 
BRUCE YAMASHITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce Yamashita has spent almost five years facing down the Marine Corps over 
his unjust dismissal from officer candidate school in 1989. The Marines have 
admitted that racism played a role in his dismissal and recently appointed him 
a captain in the reserve corps. That surely was the right thing to do in this 
case, which has significant implications. 
</P>
<P>
 During a long fight Yamashita showed that there was a pervasive and consistent 
pattern of discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities in OCS. That has 
forced the Marines to change OCS policies and procedures. The OCS training 
manual, for example, was revised last February to make clear that the corps 
forbids statements, gestures and any actions that could be interpreted as 
racial, gender or ethnic prejudice or bias. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamashita, a third-generation American of Japanese ancestry, was subject to 
just such abuses during his OCS training in Quantico, Va. On his first day of 
class, a staff sergeant told him, "We don't want your kind around here. Go back 
to your country." Another instructor asked him why he had not joined the 
Japanese army. Yamashita was addressed regularly by the trade names of Japanese 
cars. Another drill sergeant reminded him that the United States in World War 
II had "whipped your Japanese ass."(Yamashita's grandparents settled in Hawaii 
100 years ago. His uncle was in the highly decorated, all-Japanese-American 
442nd Regimental Combat Team and received a Purple Heart in World War II.) 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before his graduation from OCS, Yamashita, now 37 and an attorney in 
Washington, was "disenrolled" for what was described as "leadership failure." 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines initially explained away the racial remarks as an appropriate test 
of Yamashita's mental toughness. Later the corps apologized and offered to let 
him take the course over. Yamashita refused, maintaining that an officer's 
commission was his due and that negative references to his leadership should be 
expunged from his record. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamashita held out for what was right and just. Discrimination clearly is not. 
For acknowledging that, the Marines should be better off.

IRISH EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tip O'Neill was the very image of the portly, cigar-smoking (Cuban, 
preferably) back-room politician. He cared more about cutting the deal than 
writing legislation, and was an Irish American from a state where ethnicity 
once defined politics. 
</P>
<P>
 When he succeeded John F. Kennedy in the House in 1952, the conventional 
wisdom was that the Massachusetts legislator, though locally powerful, was 
merely keeping the "Kennedy seat" warm. What an underestimation.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill never practiced the politics of division; Irish to the core, he cared 
passionately for the common weal. "All politics is local," declared the man who 
would be a House Speaker equal to Sam Rayburn. On his retirement in 1986, his 
blessing mattered as a Kennedy from a new generation successfully ran for the 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Another person of Irish extraction, Virginia Kelley, nee Cassidy, was once a 
young widow struggling to find a way to support herself and her infant son, 
William, in Arkansas. Through this and other hard times, her expectations of 
life always were high. She, too, defied the odds -- by raising a President who 
saw her as his pillar and friend. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill and Kelley, who no one would have thought to pair in life, were thrown 
together this week in the propinquity of their deaths, each within hours of the 
other. One changed the world in his own right, even defying a President of his 
own party in opposing the Vietnam War; the other passed on to her elder boy an 
optimism and tenacity that propelled him to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 A mover and a mother, they left legacies deserving of our heartfelt 
appreciation.

OPINION POLL ON ANIMAL RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Creatures Great and -- Equal?," Dec 25: 
</P>
<P>
 There is a paradox at the heart of the animal rights movement, which so far 
has not received the attention it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Animals may indeed have consciousness and feelings, but only human beings are 
capable of abandoning their own interests in the name of an abstract idea. Ask 
a spider if a fly has equal rights, or a cat if it is willing to stop chasing 
mice out of altruism. Squeamish lions, sharks and polar bears are hardly likely 
to abandon their position at the top of the food chain in order to become 
vegetarians. Only people make such essentially irrational decisions as these. 
</P>
<P>
 By the very act of asserting that animals are our equals, animal rights 
activists are demonstrating that capacity for moral reasoning and 
self-transcendence that human beings alone possess. On the other hand, those 
who see other species only as food or raw material can justifiably be accused 
of abandoning their human capacity for empathy and behaving like animals.

 * The moronic statements of persons such as Ingrid Newkirk (chairwoman of 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) should not go unchallenged. She is 
quoted as saying that animals "are not cheap burglar alarms or living toys." 
The partnership between humans and dogs is many thousands of years old and has 
benefited both. 
</P>
<P>
 The abduction of Polly Klaas, for example, would never have happened had there 
been a family dog of some size and a protective temperament in the house with 
those children.

activists attacked me with a venom: unprintable four-letter words, etc. What 
was I guilty of? A black leather skirt, a black leather Western jacket with 
fringe, beads and some bird feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 We American women have to look at the agenda of these lunatics. They obviously 
plan to eliminate all animal use. Where is my freedom to choose what to wear 
and what to eat?

WARREN COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I recently have received a copy of a Nov. 23 article on the Kennedy 
assassination by Sara Fritz. In that article she quotes me as counsel to the 
Warren Commission, saying: "David W. Belin, a former staff attorney who has 
been the most outspoken among the defenders of the Warren Commission, says the 
(medical) panel's 'biggest mistake was to yield to the desires of the Kennedy 
family that the autopsy photos be kept out of the public domain.'" 
</P>
<P>
 That quotation was part of an overall interview in which the primary focus was 
that, beyond a reasonable doubt, Oswald was the lone gunman who killed Kennedy, 
wounded Gov. John Connally and killed Officer J. D. Tippit; all of the shots 
came from the rear, as confirmed by four separate medical panels as well as by 
the ballistic evidence; and the main reason so many people do not believe the 
Warren Commission is that electronic media have never given the truth an equal 
opportunity to be heard. In this connection, I asked Sara Fritz to read copies 
of several articles I had written together with the transcript of an appearance 
before the National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, although the quotation that Sara Fritz made was technically 
correct, it failed to communicate to your readers the primary thrust of our 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who is involved in the media world and who is deeply concerned 
about First Amendment rights, I find a great frustration when the truth does 
not have an equal opportunity to be heard and when reporters take snippets of 
conversations and do not report the basic thrust of the interview.

COURT UPHOLDS FIRING OF OFFICER FOR AFFAIR; SIMI VALLEY: KEVIN MEDLEY WAS 
TERMINATED FOR HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH A SCOUT. THE COUPLE HAVEN'T DECIDED 
WHETHER TO APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County Superior Court judge has upheld the firing of a Simi Valley 
police officer who had an ongoing sexual relationship with a 17-year-old 
Explorer Scout. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Officer Kevin Medley, 36, lost his bid this week to be rehired, paid 
lost wages and cleared in personnel records when Judge Edwin M. Osborne ruled 
that the officer was fired for just cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Medley could not be reached for comment Thursday. But his lawyer's office said 
the officer and the Scout, who were married 11 days before Medley was fired in 
October, 1992, have not decided whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, they're just going to consider their options," said a law clerk 
for attorney Darryl Mounger, who declined to give his name. "They have not 
decided on their next course of action." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Lindsey Paul Miller said Thursday, "I felt initially that his 
discharge was the correct thing to do under the circumstances and I still do. 
And I'm pleased the court ruled in our favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Medley had served on the Simi Valley Police Department for three years until 
he was fired Oct. 28, 1992. Officials ruled that his affair with the 
17-year-old girl violated the statutory rape law and department policy against 
officers socializing with the department's Explorer Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Medley met the girl while she was a member of the Explorer Scout program, 
which gives youths ages 14 to 20 a background in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 He later testified in a hearing over his firing that he believed the girl was 
over 18 because she had a job, a bank account with an automated teller machine 
card and a car she had bought, according to court records.  
</P>
<P>
 Medley also testified that he thought the girl was of legal age because she 
was enrolled in college and not subject to any restrictions at home, records 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Miller recommended the city fire Medley after the affair was discovered, 
and City Manager Lin Koester terminated the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, a state appeals mediator recommended the city rehire Medley, but 
Koester stood by his earlier decision to fire the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the allegation that Medley broke a state law against adults having sex 
with minors, prosecutors did not file a case against Medley after the girl's 
parents refused to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, now 18, married Medley on Oct. 17, 1992, with her parents serving as 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Medley petitioned the Ventura County Superior Court to have his job back, his 
lost wages and legal fees paid and his record cleared of any references to the 
affair and the department's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 His petition argued that the firing was an excessive penalty, and that 
Koester's final ruling was not supported by the evidence presented at the 
appeal hearing last April. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, Judge Osborne ruled that there was enough evidence to believe 
Medley's affair with the girl violated state law, and that he knew or should 
have known she was not 18, said Stephen L. Millich, Simi Valley assistant city 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne also ruled that city officials did not abuse their discretion in 
firing Medley, Millich said. The attorney added, "I think the judge was 
correct." 
</P>
<P>
 About five years before Medley's firing, the department disciplined four 
officers -- some of them married -- for being involved with another Explorer 
Scout, court records show. Two were fired for having sex with the girl, the 
other two for kissing her and fondling her breast, the records said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those incidents drove department officials to pass a policy forbidding Simi 
Valley officers from socializing with Explorer Scouts.

OFFICER MARTIN GANZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I address this letter to express my absolute outrage and sorrow over the 
recent killing of Officer Martin Ganz of the Manhattan Beach Police Department 
(Dec. 29). I am certain that the community has lost one of its most 
professional and compassionate officers as the result of a senseless act of 
violence and cowardice. 
</P>
<P>
 This tragic incident is a grim reminder of the danger the men and women in 
uniform face on a daily basis while protecting our communities. They deserve 
our support and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 I had the pleasure of working with Officer Ganz as the result of his 
involvement in a driving-under-the-influence investigation out of Manhattan 
Beach. The woman under investigation had small children in her car who were 
very upset and scared by the traffic stop and arrest of their mother. As backup 
for another officer who conducted the investigation, Ganz consoled the children 
and spent time reassuring them. After the mother and children were transported 
back to the station, Ganz spent hours with the children until a relative could 
be reached to come and pick them up. He also spent his own money to buy them 
food because they were hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Ganz was a true professional and will be dearly missed.

 * In recent months, police officers in the Los Angeles area involved with 
traffic stops have needlessly lost their lives, having been murdered by 
ruthless thugs who live by the gun. There is regrettably little that we 
citizens can do for those gallant officers except to demand that video cameras 
be installed in all patrol cars and mandate that absolutely all traffic stops 
be accompanied by radio messages giving the license number and description of 
the vehicle. What does it take to protect those who protect us?

TRIAL LAWYERS AND TORT REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thank you for your expose on the strong-arm tactics employed by the powerful 
California Trial Lawyers Assn. to deny Californians the chance to vote next 
November on the proposed Lawyer Accountability Act of 1994 (Dec. 27). The 
biggest losers are California consumers, taxpayers, job seekers and businesses. 
Indeed, four out of five Californians support civil justice reform, and believe 
that the lawyers are to blame for the current abusive liability system. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic toll of lawsuit abuse is staggering. In 1992 alone, California's 
lawyers filed 805,000 civil lawsuits -- or one new lawsuit for every 39 
Californians. Unwarranted litigation drives up the cost of goods, services and 
insurance premiums for all consumers, stifles the development of new products 
such as AIDS vaccines, destroys jobs and opportunity, reduces competitiveness, 
harms the state's economic climate, and burdens taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians are poised to put a halt to lawsuit abuse. After we unveiled the 
initiative, we received an outpouring of support, not only from prominent 
opinion leaders, but especially from individuals and small business people, who 
cannot simply pass on the tremendous costs of the tort system. In addition, 
larger businesses and the insurance industry, the "deep pocket" targets of 
predatory lawyers, naturally support our efforts to reform California's 
out-of-control civil liability system. 
</P>
<P>
 The public overwhelmingly realizes that its interests are threatened -- not 
protected -- by the excesses of the current civil liability system, which is 
controlled by and for the lawyers. It is, therefore, little wonder that the 
lawyers' lobby is so relieved to have derailed public debate on meaningful 
reform -- at least for now.

 * Pretty diabolical, that preemptive strike of California lawyers against 
Farmers Insurance -- but quite in character. The story goes that God and Satan 
decided to build a freeway between heaven and hell (avoiding South Pasadena, no 
doubt). Later God billed Satan for half of the construction. Satan refused to 
pay. God said, "I'll sue." Satan answered, "Where will you get the lawyers?"

<P>
 * Well, it looks as if the last of the robber barons, better known as members 
of the California Trial lawyers Assn., have won another battle. The business 
climate in California will remain bad and the taxpayers will still have to pay 
for their greedy appetites. Oh, they will say that they have no negative effect 
on jobs, but when money goes into their pockets, that money is no longer 
available for attracting business or investing in job growth. 
</P>
<P>
 They also represent the last vestiges of slavery, i.e., the legal sanction of 
the punishment of one individual by another individual. Punishment should be 
the sole reserve of the state. In other words, punitive damages should be set 
by, extracted by and paid to the state.

 * Tom Snyder's letter (Dec. 20) is a rather specious analysis of why 
right-wing Christians have not been more successful at being elected to school 
boards. The complaint that "conservative Christians have been virtually locked 
out of the decision-making process in our educational institutions . . . " 
rings as true as the lumping together of everyone Snyder disagrees with as 
"anti-Christian bigots." 
</P>
<P>
 As president of the board of directors of Planned Parenthood of Orange and San 
Bernardino Counties, I can assure the writer that his generalization, which 
includes Planned Parenthood, is extreme to a fault. Perhaps that is why many 
voters are reluctant to entrust their schools' leadership to religious 
practitioners. They have a knack of doing too much "lumping together" instead 
of careful study and analysis of the educational issues before us. What is not 
understood or agreed with is simply condemned.

SHOULD YOUNG PEOPLE BE EXPOSED TO THE HORRORS OF 'SCHINDLER'S LIST'?; 
HOLOCAUST: CHILDREN MUST KNOW ABOUT THEIR ELDERS' DOUBLE WITNESS -- THE 
CAPACITY OF HUMANS TO HURT AND TO HEAL AND SAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAROLD M. SCHULWEIS, Rabbi Harold M. Schulweis is the founding chairman of 
the Jewish Foundation for Christian Rescuers / Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Should we take our youngsters to see "Schindler's List"? Should we expose them 
to the excremental assault on the dignity of men, women and children during the 
horror years of the Holocaust? Or will we perhaps inadvertently lay a heavy 
stone of despair upon their young hearts? (The film is R-rated largely for its 
graphic portrayals of violence and terror that many adults find too painful to 
watch, but in context, the film is not unsuitable for older children.)  
</P>
<P>
 It is important that our Jewish and non-Jewish children know what happened. 
Cicero was correct: "Not to know what happened before you were born is to 
remain forever a child." It is perilous to raise children in ignorance of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is not whether to know or to remember but what to remember and 
how to serve the honor of that memory so that it strengthens our morale and 
morality. Oskar Schindler, the Roman Catholic rescuer, represents that small 
but precious number of human beings who risked their fortunes, lives and the 
lives of their families to rescue people not of their faith. In every country 
that the Nazi predators invaded, there were ordinary men and women and families 
that refused to succumb to the ugly rationalization that there is no 
alternative to passive complicity with totalitarian killers of the dream. 
</P>
<P>
 In every country there were men, women and children, some of whom live among 
us, who refused to be caught in the deadly vise of "them" and "us" and who hid 
people not of their catechism in closets, attics, cellars, pig sties, holes in 
the ground. Ordinary people in every Nazi occupied country forged passports, 
falsified baptismal certificates, arranged underground escape routes knowing 
full well the consequences that would follow their being discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Our children must know it all. They must know the murderers but they must know 
the rescuers as well. They must know the story of Anne Frank but they must know 
as well the names and history of those Christians who kept her family alive in 
the attic for 2 1/2 years fully aware of what would happen if they were caught 
by informers or the Nazis. Do our children know of the rescuers of Anne Frank? 
What happened to Victor Kugler, Jann Kleimman, Meep Gies, Elizabeth Van 
Voskuijl after their arrest and imprisonment in the Amersfoort concentration 
camp? 
</P>
<P>
 Do our schools, churches and synagogues teach the moral heroism of Christian 
rescuers of Jews, some of whom live in our own community? Have our young people 
met Irene Opdyke in Orange County, the Polish Catholic woman who hid dozens of 
Jews and saved their lives under the very nose of the Gestapo? Or John Weidner 
in Monterey Park, the Seventh-Day Adventist responsible for organizing a 
network of co-conspirators known as the Dutch Paris Express, which brought more 
than 800 Jews through the mountain trails to safety in Switzerland and to 
Spain? They are alive, articulate and in our midst. But there are tens of 
thousands more who live out their lives in dire circumstances. The Jewish 
Foundation for Christian Rescuers / Anti-Defamation League provides modest 
monthly grants to more than 1,200 aged and needy rescuers in 20 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodness must not be forgotten. The rescuers must not be forgotten. It is 
important for our own therapy after the traumatized conscience of the 
Holocaust. In an era of growing polarization, xenophobic nativism, violence and 
selfishness, it is important that our children know real moral heroes of flesh 
and bone, human beings who demonstrated with their lives that the neighbor whom 
we are to love is not exclusively the one who prays or believes our way -- that 
the neighbor is one created in God's image. 
</P>
<P>
 Children of the post-Holocaust need to have evidence of the sparks of divinity 
that are lodged in the dark husks of violence. They need moral heroes to 
respect the sanctity within themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 And we, their mentors, need moral heroes as mirrors held up to our own selves. 
Whom would we hide? Would we open the door to a pregnant woman pursued by 
vicious enemies? Would we hide the sobbing children? Would we offer them food 
and clothing? Would we handle their refuse, search out a doctor, bury their 
bodies undetected by the enemy? Would we turn ourselves into hiding places from 
the wind and shelters from the tempests?  
</P>
<P>
 Take them to the movie. Sit with them and explain the double witness to which 
our generation can testify: the capacity of human beings to hurt and the 
capacity of human beings to heal and to save.

A PARTNERSHIP OF UNEQUALS CAN BE SATISFACTORY TO ALL; EUROPE: PROMISES OF NATO 
MEMBERSHIP WON'T ADDRESS SECURITY WORRIES IN THE EAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENT SCOWCROFT; STEPHEN HADLEY, ; ARNOLD KANTER, Former National Security 
Adviser Brent Scowcroft is president of the Forum for International Policy, a 
new organization based in Washington. Stephen Hadley and Arnold Kanter are 
senior associates of the forum. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At next week's NATO summit in Brussels, President Clinton will propose -- and 
the allies will unanimously agree -- that the alliance offer to establish 
"partnerships for peace" with all the countries of Europe that are not now NATO 
members as well as with all the states of the former Soviet Union. This 
"partnership" approach, however, does not meet the security and political 
challenges we face in Europe; at best, it can only provide some time and 
rhetorical cover while we turn to the difficult work of fashioning an effective 
post-Cold War security strategy for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership proposal is intended to deal with the following dilemma: How 
to use NATO to respond to the security concerns of countries such as Poland, 
Hungary and the Czech Republic without strengthening the hand of the 
ultra-nationalists in Moscow who search eagerly for "evidence" to support their 
claims that the West is engaged in a new plot to isolate and encircle Russia. 
If Russia is excluded from NATO membership while Poland and Hungary are on the 
path to becoming NATO allies, how can Moscow avoid the conclusion that a 
renewed and enlarged NATO retains its traditional objective of confronting 
Russia? Conversely, why should Poland and Hungary find comfort in NATO 
membership if Russia -- their primary security concern -- is on the same path 
to becoming one of their "allies" in NATO? 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership concept skirts this dilemma by nominally treating all the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union the same, 
and by offering to form a NATO "partnership" with any that are interested in 
doing so. As described by the Administration, this "partnership" can also serve 
as an "apprenticeship" to becoming a full-fledged NATO ally: As a partner 
demonstrates that it can perform the same military roles as current NATO 
members and can meet the same political and economic norms, the door will be 
increasingly opened to NATO membership. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, the "dilemma" rests on a faulty premise: that NATO membership 
is the prize, the best -- perhaps only -- way to address the security concerns 
of European states. The "partnership for peace" simply reinforces that premise, 
complicating the task of redefining and reshaping NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership offer is intended as a response to the urgent pleas of Poland 
and others for strengthened security ties. Yet the prospect of eventual NATO 
membership loses its value when the possibility is open to countries such as 
Switzerland and Uzbekistan as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, "partnership for peace" confirms that U.S. deference to Russian 
sensibilities has now deferred NATO's expansion to the East. While Poland, 
Hungary and the Czechs may eventually achieve NATO membership, by then the 
alliance may have become an empty anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
 The faulty premise gives rise to some potentially perverse incentives. By 
treating "partnership" as an apprenticeship to becoming formal NATO allies, the 
proposal encourages NATO aspirants to devote scarce resources to improving 
their military forces at a time when their fragile political systems need to 
strengthen their economies. Perversely, the security assurances they need now 
at a time of great political and economic vulnerability will instead be their 
future reward -- if and when they achieve political and economic success. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a better way. Like "partnership for peace," it begins by recognizing 
that while NATO expansion may be an answer to some other question, offers of 
NATO membership to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe exacerbate 
rather than resolve the current political and security problems facing the 
alliance. But in contrast to the partnership concept, which makes eventual NATO 
membership both the prize and the standard by which countries compare 
themselves with others, it would establish relationships with Russia, Ukraine 
and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that are tailored to their 
respective needs. 
</P>
<P>
 A new strategy for security in Europe should include the following five 
elements: 
</P>
<P>
 * Preservation of an effective NATO. Both its security role and the strong 
ties between the United States and our European allies need to be maintained in 
the face of neo-isolationist impulses on both sides of the Atlantic. A NATO 
that is little more than a political membership club could strengthen the hand 
of reactionary forces by suggesting that an irresolute West could not respond 
to Russian expansionist moves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishment of a formal relationship between NATO and Russia. NATO 
membership for Russia is a red herring; it arises only because we have made it 
into a stamp of political approval. The commitment to collective defense, the 
central feature of NATO, makes no sense for Russia, which has the wherewithal 
to safeguard its own security and does not need Belgium to come to its defense. 
A formal security relationship between NATO and Russia, grounded in a mutual 
recognition of Russia's distinctive geostrategic role and importance, by 
contrast, does make sense. Such a relationship could affirm that neither Russia 
nor NATO poses a threat to the other and formalize military cooperation in 
areas such as peacekeeping, nonproliferation, nuclear safety and security, as 
well as ensure transparency in military matters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Extension of formal security assurances by NATO to Poland, Hungary and the 
Czech Republic, the three countries where instability would be the greatest 
threat to allied interests. Building on the promise of security consultations 
with "active partners" contained in the "partnership for peace," NATO could 
formally state what already is the strategic reality: that an armed attack 
against any of them would be viewed as an attack on the peace of Europe. Such 
an assurance would respond to their security concerns without moving NATO's 
military presence closer to Russia, and would avoid the difficult dilemmas 
associated with NATO membership. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new approach to Ukraine. There may be no greater proximate threat to the 
security of Europe than instability in Ukraine. NATO needs to offer Ukraine a 
security relationship that recognizes its unique character; for example, a 
formal agreement codifying a program of military cooperation. This should not 
be contingent on Ukraine's relinquishing the nuclear weapons in its territory. 
If we tend to our broader security interests, we make favorable resolution of 
the nuclear issue more, not less, likely. 
</P>
<P>
 * Support for the independence of all the states of Central and Eastern Europe 
and the former Soviet Union. This can be furthered by cooperation between NATO 
and these states within the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council, in which they already participate.  
</P>
<P>
 An approach based on these five elements would directly and immediately 
address the security problems and concerns of post-Cold War Europe while 
avoiding irrelevant issues. This is the "partnership for peace" that President 
Clinton should bring next week to Brussels -- and Prague, Moscow and Minsk.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; NO. 7 ESTANCIA MISFIRES, HANDS COSTA MESA A VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's Heather Robinson had plenty to do with her team's 52-51 overtime 
victory over visiting Estancia in a Pacific Coast League game Thursday. She 
scored 26 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and scored the rebound basket with five 
seconds left that sent the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 But not even Robinson can take credit for the gift seventh-ranked Estancia 
gave her team in the fourth quarter. Clinging to leads of two and four 
throughout the fourth quarter, Estancia missed all eight of its free throws to 
give life to Costa Mesa (7-6, 1-0 in league). For the game, Estancia (11-2, 
0-1) made only seven of 24 from the line. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't any single culprit for the Eagles. They all faltered at the line 
in the fourth quarter. Laura Czingula and Jessica Waltz missed all three of 
their attempts and Jenny Drake was 0 for 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will hurt you every time," Estancia assistant coach Rich Boyce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Coach Lisa McNamee was surprised to hear of Estancia troubles at 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every game there's a little bit of luck involved," she said. "I didn't even 
now they missed that many until now." 
</P>
<P>
 While Estancia was throwing up bricks from the line, Robinson was barely 
hitting the net with her shots. She made 10 of 11 free throws, including nine 
of nine in the fourth quarter and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what you dream of -- to be at the line when it counts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson was also underneath the basket when it counted. She snuck in and 
rebounded teammate Koo Kim's missed free throw with five seconds left and 
banked in the tying basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even feel like I was in control of my body," she said. "I think I 
was possessed or something." 
</P>
<P>
 In overtime, Robinson scored all six of the Mustangs' points on free throws.

GIRLS' SOCCER ROUNDUP; LOS ALAMITOS RALLIES, TIES EL DORADO, 2-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite the differences in attitude, the El Dorado and Los Alamitos girls' 
soccer teams played to a 2-2 tie Thursday at El Dorado in their Empire League 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult for us to get up for this," Los Alamitos Coach Mark Morin 
said."But this was just our first league game and El Dorado is not a big rival 
of ours." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 7 El Dorado (12-3-2) played a spirited game, hoping to start the league 
season by knocking off last season's league champions, No. 8 Los Alamitos 
(8-2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 However, two late goals by Los Alamitos frustrated the Golden Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think we outplayed them," El Dorado Coach Jeff Holcomb said. "Our 
biggest problem has been starting slow, but today I thought we came out good 
and played a full 80-minute game for the first time this season." 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado controlled the first half, taking a 1-0 lead on a goal by Carlye 
Wind. Wind scored again early in the second half, but the Griffins followed 
with a late charge. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 25 minutes left in the game, Nicolle Storey scored on El Dorado's 
Kristee Schmidt. Schmidt made the initial save, one of three in the game, but 
then tapped in the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Kuzminsky then tied the score with about eight minutes left, taking a 
pass from Sommer Hammoud on an outnumbered attack. PETER BARZILAI

CENTURY LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; THREE-POINTERS HELP VILLA PARK TOP EL 
MODENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 As Michelle Miyake sat in the quiet of Villa Park's team room Thursday night, 
she recalled the anguish she felt as she watched much of the third quarter from 
the bench because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated watching it and not being able to do anything," she said. "When I 
went in in the fourth quarter, I went in confident and knew I had to do my 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Her "thing" is shooting the three-point basket, and after El Modena pulled to 
within four points, Miyake buried two three-pointers in the final 2 minutes 25 
seconds to help Villa Park hold off the Vanguards, 48-36, in a Century League 
showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It pitted last year's champion, Villa Park (13-2, 1-0), against the team that 
had won the title the previous two years, El Modena (4-8, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards had won three of their last four games, including a one-point 
loss to eighth-ranked Edison, which it led by six in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was critical for us," Villa Park Coach Len Whitacre said. "There are two 
teams we have a fear of, Canyon and El Modena; we see a lot of matchup problems 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Miyake (14 points) made up for it with her long-range shooting; she had 
four three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michelle stepped up, took a chance and killed us," El Modena Coach John 
Cahill said. "That was the backbreaker, right there." 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena's problem wasn't its defense, but its 26 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put a lot of pressure on us," Cahill said. "They're a good team. They 
know how to play defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park's problem was its shooting. The Spartans made only 13 of 50 (26%), 
and Miyake's three-pointers were their only field goals in the fourth quarter 
as El Modena cut an 11-point deficit to four with 2:57 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Skehan had a game-high 18 points, despite making only one of her first 
14 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jo Pennington had 11 points and 12 rebounds for Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena got 13 points and six rebounds from Jamie Shine, last year's league 
most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon 63, Santa Ana Valley 48 -- Sara Spjut had 20 points and Robynn Kuhlmann 
had 19 points for Canyon (8-6, 1-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill 38, Orange 28 -- Guard Katy Steinle had 16 points for Foothill (5-9, 
1-0). Foothill was 13 of 16 from the free-throw line.

TOROS STAGGER IN SECOND HALF BUT WIN CONFERENCE OPENER; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 
DOMINGUEZ HILLS SQUANDERS HALFTIME LEAD BUT RALLIES DOWN THE STRETCH TO BEAT 
SAN BERNARDINO, 66-57. 
</P>

<P>
 Leading by 14 points at halftime, Cal State Dominguez Hills appeared on its 
way to an easy victory in its California Collegiate Athletic Assn. men's 
basketball opener against Cal State San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dominguez Hills struggled in the second half and held off a Coyote rally 
for a 66-57 victory Thursday night at the Toro gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had it comfortably in hand and in the second half we let them 
get back in it," Dominguez Hills Coach Dave Yanai said. "We just played very 
lethargic at the start of the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Hills (10-3) benefited from San Bernardino's poor shooting to assume 
a 35-21 halftime lead. The Coyotes (7-7) made only 19.6% of their shots on six 
of 31 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind guards Chris Thompson and Carlos Paul, Dominguez Hills opened up a 12-2 
lead in the first six minutes and increased it to 16 points late in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the second half San Bernardino used the outside shooting of guards Eric 
Carpenter -- a former Harbor College and Serra High standout -- and Wayne 
Williams to rally. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Carpenter's fourth three-point basket of the second half that gave San 
Bernardino a 51-50 lead with 6 minutes 19 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pretty much just took a gut check after the first half," San Bernardino 
Coach Reggie Morris said. "We just came out and played as aggressive as they 
did and kind of neutralized them." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Toros responded with a 12-2 run to put the game away. Dominguez Hills 
went ahead for good, 55-53, on a basket by forward Joe Bertrand with 3:25 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his team's sluggish second half, Yanai was happy with the win. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what you do in the preseason, you can throw away the records when 
you start conference play," Yanai said. "So it's very nice to get off to a good 
start. It's so important in this conference to win your home games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Toros were led on offense by Thompson with 18 points and Paul with 17. 
Bertrand also sparked Dominguez Hills with a career-high 17 rebounds -- the 
sixth consecutive game in which he has rebounded in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino, which finished shooting 30.4% from the field, was led by 
Carpenter with 18 points and Williams with 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Hills continues conference play Saturday night with a home game 
against Cal Poly Pomona (9-6, 0-1).

HOBBLING VENTURA PUTS HURT ON VALLEY; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: INJURY-RIDDLED 
PIRATES MAKE LATE FREE THROWS TO SECURE 68-56 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The walking wounded better get well quickly or the Ventura College basketball 
team may soon pay dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 With starting center Michael Tate out with an ankle injury and forward Steve 
Amar nursing a sore back, the Pirates struggled to beat Valley, 68-56, in a 
Western State Conference inter-divisional game Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 20th consecutive victory for the Pirates (20-1, 2-0 in conference 
play), the state's top-ranked team. But it wasn't easy against a determined 
Valley squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played through adversity and won, so I'm happy," Ventura Coach Philip 
Mathews said. "Joey (Ramirez) did not play well and Brandon (Jessie) did not 
play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, the steady sophomore point guard, made only three of 17 shots but 
finished with 15 points thanks to seven free throws. Jessie, the team's 
outstanding sophomore forward, had 16 points but scored only four, all on free 
throws, during the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura shot a miserable 29.8% (20 of 67) from the field, its worst 
performance of the season. Valley (7-10, 1-1) didn't exactly set the nets on 
fire, either, hitting only 36% (22 of 61). 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jessie and Ramirez were not the offensive factors they usually are, 
guards D'Mitri Rideout (10 points and three steals), center Alfred Kennedy (10 
points and eight rebounds) and guard Tracy Lundy (11 points) hit their shots to 
pick up the slack. Lundy replaced Amar early in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned with Ramirez and Jessie but some of their other players 
beat us," Valley Coach Doug Michelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura led at halftime, 35-29, but Valley pulled to within 57-54 with 1 
minute 52 seconds to play. However, a technical foul called against Valley 
center Brian Jackson for hanging on the rim during an attempted offensive 
rebound seemed to take the wind out of the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez converted one of the two free throws after the technical, Rideout made 
two more from the line and Ramirez scored the final seven points of the game 
(five on free throws). After the technical foul, Valley scored only on a layup 
by Wayne Carlisle with 44 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Craig Griffin scored 18 points for Valley, including 13 in the first 
half, and Carlisle added 17. Jackson had nine rebounds.

BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; CHANNEL ISLANDS WINS WITH FLAIR

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Channel Islands High girls are not interested in good theater, and they're 
a little perturbed at playing these nail-biting basketball games. Give them a 
blowout filled with ennui rather than a dramatic finish any day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't feel the games should be this close," Channel Islands Coach Don 
Salado said after Thursday night's 56-51 victory over host Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we have better athletes than anyone else or they wouldn't have picked 
us as the top team in the (Marmonte) League," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Salado had to be pleased with his team's late free-throw shooting, which 
proved to be the difference. Channel Islands (12-2, 3-0) made 13 of 20 free 
throws in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Pioneers (9-6, 1-1) pulled to within 52-51 with just over a minute 
to play, Raider guard Shawanda Hotchkiss made one of two free throws. Teammate 
Mickie Liufau added three of four from the line in the final minute to clinch 
the victory. KENNEDY COSGROVE

BOOK REVIEW / FAMILY MEMOIR; A REPORTER'S JOURNEY TO THE CORE OF HIS HERITAGE; 
RECONCILIATION ROAD: A FAMILY ODYSSEY OF WAR AND HONOR BY JOHN DOUGLAS MARSHALL 
, SYRACUSE: SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY PRESS $24.95, 312 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL DORRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a quiet moment during a dinner party the other night, a man I didn't know 
said, with no apparent lead-in, "You know, every male of our generation was 
profoundly affected by Vietnam. Our individual reactions -- to go or not, to 
deal with our decision -- influenced everything that followed in our lives. I 
try to explain it to my kids, the ongoing centrality of that time to me, and 
they act as though I'm speaking a different language." 
</P>
<P>
 John Douglas Marshall, a feature writer for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 
would certainly understand what the speaker was talking about. The oldest son 
of a prominent army family, the grandson of war historian S.L.A. "Slam" 
Marshall, he had been long groomed for active military duty. 
</P>
<P>
 After enlistment, however, he realized that at heart he was a pacifist and 
ultimately applied for, and was granted, status as a conscientious objector. He 
thus became one of the 7,493 men already conscripted who were granted c.o. 
discharges during the Vietnam conflict (172,000 others were never drafted). 
</P>
<P>
 To the Marshall family, especially to his grandfather, John immediately became 
a pariah, a persona non grata -- a situation seemingly made permanent by Slam 
Marshall's eventual death. As a result, John was a virtual orphan during much 
of his 20s, marrying, beginning a career, finding his way into maturity alone. 
</P>
<P>
 He never doubted or regretted his ethical choice, but naturally he felt 
sorrow, some anger, loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, years later, a scathing article in American Heritage magazine cast 
aspersions on some of Slam Marshall's most controversial historical research -- 
the book "Men Against Fire," in which he had asserted that many soldiers in 
combat never so much as fired their guns at the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 This startling conclusion was said to be based upon extensive post-battle 
interviews -- conversations that some now accused had never taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Surviving members of the family -- John's father and brother among them -- 
were outraged at these charges and asked John, now a respected journalist, to 
use his investigative skills to vindicate Slam's reputation, to prove his 
detractors false. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus began John Marshall's personal odyssey, a journey that encompassed more 
than 10,000 miles. As he traveled the country, to army bases in Texas and 
Kansas, to Sun Belt communities where Slam's old buddies had retired, to 
archives in Washington and Pennsylvania, he tried diligently to piece together 
the puzzle that was not only his grandfather, but his own heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Who was this short, assured general, this consultant to Mike Wallace, this 
prolific writer whose books influenced generations of army officers, this man 
who said, late in life, that the greatest compliment he ever received was that 
he had never been afraid of anything? 
</P>
<P>
 What made him so intransigent in his opinions, so stubborn in his refusal to 
allow for a different point of view? Was it his diminutive size? His ego? A 
fierceness that discouraged the dissent of friends or colleagues? 
</P>
<P>
 John Marshall documents his progress with a reporter's eye and ear. His prose 
is clear, factual, even-handed -- and that is, perhaps, this interesting book's 
only flaw. Describing his experience, he writes, "These days of end game on the 
road have taken on the quality of a speeded-up movie, hit-and-run visits with 
people, long stretches doing 75 on the Interstate." 
</P>
<P>
 In the rush, in the deeply felt obligation to tell all, the narrative 
sometimes blurs, and in the end, few individual characters stand out in a 
reader's memory. Rather, we are left with an impression of an honest, earnest 
man chipping away at an enigma that remains forever aloof. Clearly John 
Marshall is an individual of passionate conviction. Of his life-altering 
resolve to become a conscientious objector, he notes, "I have always felt . . . 
that if I never did anything else worthwhile in my life, at least I did this. I 
took a stand for what I believe." 
</P>
<P>
 When, late in the book, someone remarks that Slam Marshall shared this courage 
to act on belief, John finds peace of a sort in the idea that he does, 
therefore, participate in a family legacy, that he does, after all, belong. 
</P>
<P>
 But we who have followed him on his quest of attempted discovery are left with 
a slightly different impression. For all of his bravado and bluster, for all of 
his erudite writing and long-term theoretical impact, Slam Marshall emerges as 
a cold and selfish autocrat. 
</P>
<P>
 His grandson, by bravely refusing to fit himself into another's mold, has 
escaped this patrimony and become instead that most admirable of successes: a 
decent human being.

WILSON TO CALL FOR COLLEGE FEE HIKES; EDUCATION: HIS PLAN, TO BE UNVEILED 
TODAY, MAINTAINS FUNDING LEVEL FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. BUDGET IS TENUOUSLY BASED ON 
FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS FOR IMMIGRATION COSTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson today will propose giving public schools enough money to keep 
pace with expanding enrollments next year while encouraging another round of 
fee increases for students in community colleges and the state's two university 
systems, Administration sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also intends to up the ante in his ongoing battle with the federal 
government over the cost of providing services to illegal immigrants in 
California, those sources said. He will ask for even more federal money than he 
did a year ago, when Congress ended up approving a far lower amount than he had 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will release next fiscal year's state budget plan, of which education 
is the largest component, at a news conference today. If the Legislature goes 
along, it would allow elementary and secondary schools to spend the same amount 
per student next school year as they are today. This level of per-pupil 
spending keeps an agreement the governor made to end a budget impasse two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 California's community colleges, under Wilson's plan, would reduce services to 
students unless the junior colleges raise fees from $13 per unit to $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's two university systems, meanwhile, would get modest increases in 
taxpayer funding but would be expected to pass on hefty fee increases to their 
students in order to keep pace with rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
 All levels of education fare relatively well in Wilson's budget compared to 
many other programs, Administration sources said. Wilson hopes to provide money 
for an expected 16,000 additional preschool children and more funds for 
programs he created to provide increased health and mental health counseling 
services to schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 But the entire spending plan could unravel because it apparently rests on the 
fragile hope that the state will receive more than $2 billion from the federal 
government as reimbursement for services to immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson last year asked for $1.4 billion from the federal government to offset 
the cost of providing health and welfare programs to immigrants and imprisoning 
illegal immigrants who break the law. Congress approved only $324 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's wish list includes $1.7 billion he says it will cost to educate 
the 400,000 school-age illegal immigrants that Wilson's Finance Department 
estimates live in California. But Administration sources say Wilson is 
committed to protecting education funding even if the federal government does 
not come through. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's education budget, according to documents obtained by The Times, would 
maintain spending for kindergartners through 12-graders at this year's level of 
$4,217 per student. 
</P>
<P>
 It would do so without resorting to the kind of controversial bookkeeping 
shifts -- including loans to the schools and property tax transfers -- that 
Wilson has advocated in years past. The documents say that Wilson's budget 
would give the schools $336 million more than is required by Proposition 98, 
the voter-approved constitutional amendment that set minimum levels of school 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's budget proposes $29.1 billion from all sources for kindergarten 
through 12th-grade schools, a 2.5% increase over this year. Enrollment is 
expected to grow by the same percentage.  
</P>
<P>
 But the budget provides no money to help public education keep pace with 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mockler, a lobbyist for the Los Angeles Unified School District, said 
Wilson's proposal would leave the schools with far less than they will need 
next fiscal year. Mockler said the schools have not received money for 
cost-of-living increases for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health care costs are going up, the cost of paper is going up, utilities go 
up, all the costs of running the business side of schooling are going up," 
Mockler said. "Equal dollars is better than less dollars, but you're going to 
have fewer services because those services cost more." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration concedes that California ranks only 35th in the nation in 
total spending per pupil, although education advocates maintain that the 
state's ranking is even lower than that. 
</P>
<P>
 For community colleges, Wilson proposes a 3.4% increase, to $3.6 billion, from 
all local, state and federal sources. More than one-third of the 3.4% would 
come from the proposed fee increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Community College Chancellor David M. Mertes said the increase would prompt an 
estimated 100,000 students to drop out of the 1.4-million student system. He 
said their rule of thumb is that for every $1 increase, about 1% of the student 
population leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick McCallum, executive director of the statewide community college 
faculty association, said the "sticker shock" alone would discourage many 
students, especially poorer Latinos and African Americans. "For the Los Angeles 
area, it will have a very damaging impact on the community college system," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're looking at $300 for a fee (for a full-time student), you're looking at 
$200 for your books and you're looking at not being able to work, and you say, 
'I'm just not going to be able to come up with the direct cost of $500 to 
attend community college,' " McCallum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the fact that Wilson hopes to counter the fee increase by offering nearly 
$91 million in additional student aid will not help maintain enrollments, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those prospects, Mertes and McCallum said they were encouraged by the 
3.4% overall increase Wilson wants to give the community college system. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is only a small part of the proposed $3.6-billion budget, Mertes 
said he was especially pleased that Wilson wanted to set aside $10 million for 
the system to begin linking campuses with telecommunications networks, as well 
as $2 million for a new fund to help pay for technological innovations that 
will lower the per-pupil cost of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's proposed budget falls short of the increases that University of 
California and Cal State officials had requested. UC administrators wanted an 
increase of 8%, or $142 million, and Cal State trustees were looking for an 
additional 14%, or $214 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cal State Chancellor Barry Munitz on Thursday took solace in the fact that 
the governor would grant the 323,000-student system a 3.9% increase -- $57 
million extra -- rather than impose cuts as he has during the past several 
years. Munitz said the state has cut about $800 million from the Cal State 
budget since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "My position is we should be grateful for what he has given us . . . and we 
should now prepare to talk to the Legislature and see what its position will 
be," Munitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking for the 14% increase from Wilson, Cal State trustees have already 
voted to recommend that student fees be raised $342 per year for undergraduates 
and $432 for graduate students. All Cal State students now pay $1,440 per year. 
Under the California Constitution, the final decision on Cal State fees rests 
with the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cal State is getting less than administrators had requested, Munitz 
emphatically said he will not seek an additional increase in student fees to 
make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said to our students and their families . . . 'This is how you should be 
planning for next year. We're giving you a year in advance and we're not going 
to jerk you around.' . . . I just feel strongly that we are not in the 
situation that every year we should be increasing fees on an ad-hoc basis to 
respond to a budget crisis," Munitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How University of California officials will handle that controversial question 
is unknown. A UC spokesman declined Thursday to comment on the budget figures 
until they are released formally by Wilson this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's proposed budget would provide a $58-million increase, or 3.2%. That 
is far less than the university was hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
 A budget plan released by UC President Jack W. Peltason in October maintained 
that the 163,000-student system needs annual boosts of 7% to 8% from Sacramento 
in the near future to recoup losses and keep even with inflation before facing 
an expected influx of students by the end of the decade. UC officials estimate 
that the state has cut $341 million from the university's budget since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, UC regents voted to request that Wilson give them an additional 
$142 million, or 8% more. But they were warned to expect only half of that from 
the state, and Peltason has said that student fee increases of $650 per year 
would be required in 1994 and the near future to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Student representatives said Wilson's modest proposed increase translates into 
the same kind of political and economic pressure that has boosted student fees 
128% since 1989. UC students now pay an average of $3,727 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, what that means is that Gov. Wilson is continuing the trend 
he's demonstrated during the first three years of his term -- to block access 
to higher education," said Donny Emerick, a field representative for the UC 
Students Assn. "Whenever you raise a fee, you're going to decrease the amount 
of people who can afford to go to school." The Soaring Costs of College 
</P>
<P>
 Resident undergraduates in California's two university systems have seen their 
fees more than double since 1990, and Gov. Pete Wilson's proposed 1994-95 state 
budget virtually guarantees another round of increases. While the spending plan 
gives the UC and Cal State systems a modest boost, it is less than 
administrators say they need to make up for past cuts and stave off estimated 
student fee increases of $342 at CSU and $650 at UC next fall.

CONTROVERSIAL FEDERAL JUDGE STEPS DOWN FROM L.A. POST; COURTS: AGE REQUIRED 
MANUEL REAL TO LEAVE POSITION. HE IS PRAISED AS DECISIVE, BUT SOME QUESTIONED 
HIS VOLATILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than a decade as chief judge of the federal District Court in Los 
Angeles, Manuel L. Real has stepped aside, eliciting a sigh of relief from some 
fellow jurists, who were privately troubled by Real's volatility and image of 
intemperance on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his career, Real, now 69, was best known as a courageous judge who 
ordered the desegregation of the Pasadena schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Many still praise him for being decisive, accessible to lawyers organizations 
and concerned about the progress of probationers. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the past decade, he also has been portrayed as a mercurial man who 
was too quick to sanction lawyers, one of whom went so far as to question 
Real's sanity. Others called the judge a bully. 
</P>
<P>
 Real, who stepped down this week, was required by law to leave his position as 
chief judge before he reached 70 at the end of the month. His successor, chosen 
according to seniority, is the lower key William Matthew Byrne Jr., 63, whose 
father once held the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Real once engaged in a long-running battle with a federal appeals court that 
later reassigned a case to preserve "the appearance of justice." (The U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals judges took the criminal case away from Real after he 
dismissed it three times despite their order that the case go forward. 
Ultimately, Real claimed vindication after the case was settled on terms 
favorable to the defendant, Sears Roebuck & Co.) 
</P>
<P>
 Real's adversaries love to quote his favorite maxim to litigants: "This isn't 
Burger King. We don't do it your way here."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite his change in status, Real will continue to be a strong presence in 
the courthouse. In an unusual move, he is staying on as an active judge, rather 
than taking "senior" status and a lighter caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne, like Real a former U.S. attorney, is perhaps best known as the judge 
who dismissed the Justice Department's Pentagon Papers case in 1973 after it 
came to light that Richard Nixon Administration operatives illegally wiretapped 
defendant Daniel Ellsberg and broke into the office of his psychiatrist looking 
for compromising information. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been a lot of courthouse chatter about Byrne's ascendancy, 
it is unlikely that there will be any immediate visible change because the 
chief judge has little power over his colleagues, all of whom have life tenure 
and are not an easy group to manage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard Manny refer to them as 26 prima donnas," said Donald C. Smaltz, a 
Los Angeles attorney. "They all have federal judgeitis -- 'no one can touch 
me.' That makes it difficult for anyone to manage these personalities," said 
Smaltz, who was an assistant U.S. attorney under Real in the mid-1960s and is a 
close friend of the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Real likes to point out that if Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda decides a 
shortstop is not playing well, he can send him down to the minor leagues, and 
if the presiding judge of the Los Angeles County Superior Court believes that a 
trial judge is doing a lousy job, he can reassign him. "But I have zippo" power 
over the other federal judges, Real said in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. praised Real's work. "Manny's been a 
good representative for our court and I expect Matt to be, too." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, speaking anonymously, were not so kind to the outgoing chief 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real story is that everyone is tickled pink to see him go," said one 
veteran Los Angeles judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Another predicted that the court will be run more democratically under Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
 Still another opined: "Manny never saw a reform that he liked." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many lawyers criticize Real as brusque and unyielding in the 
courtroom, a lot of those lawyers also say he is quite different off the bench 
-- warm, charming and a raconteur. 
</P>
<P>
 Real knows he is controversial, doesn't shrink from it and said he is proud of 
the job he has done as chief judge since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge's job is a job in which you can't please everyone. The job of chief 
judge is a job in which you can please only a few people," Real said, sitting 
in his chambers on the second floor of the courthouse built in 1937, when 
Franklin D. Roosevelt was President and Real was a teen-ager in San Pedro, 
where he still resides. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One person Real clearly has not pleased is civil rights lawyer Stephen Yagman. 
In 1984, Real fined Yagman $250,000 for what he viewed as unprofessional 
conduct in his handling of a civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman denounced Real in terms unheard of in the usually sedate world of 
federal litigation. "He is a tyrant who is a disgrace to democracy -- he is a 
modern day Torquemada," Yagman said, comparing Real to the head of the Spanish 
Inquisition. The lawyer even accused Real of suffering from "mental disorders." 
</P>
<P>
 The County Bar Assn. rebuked Yagman for his comments. But after a lengthy 
appeal, he did not have to pay the fine. Yagman has continued to criticize Real 
and suggested last year that Real was behind a pending disciplinary case 
against him by a special committee of the federal court, a charge Real denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Real maintains that he is tough but fair. "What's wrong with that?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Some judges said they expect Byrne to facilitate smoother courthouse 
operations. "He's an accomplished administrator," said one, speaking 
anonymously. "He's been gnawing at the bit to get in there." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, the circumspect Byrne, a graduate of USC and USC Law School, 
gave no indication that he planned major changes, though he acknowledged: "I'm 
sure that Judge Real and I have different management styles." Byrne said there 
is "something special" about taking on the position held by his father, who was 
appointed to the federal bench by President Harry S. Truman in 1950 after being 
a prizefighter, railroad engineer, state legislator and state court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 A portrait of Byrne's father, along with those of the other former presiding 
judges, hangs in Real's courtroom, a courtroom he will continue to occupy for a 
while under an agreement with Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Real's hard-nosed reputation, some people have a soft spot in their 
hearts for him. On Thursday, he showed a reporter a holiday letter he received 
from a man he sentenced to probation in a 1968 draft card burning case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't let pass by unmarked this 25th anniversary of the new lease on 
life you afforded me in your courtroom," Lincoln Robbins wrote. "That 
generosity on your part, Judge Real, will stay with me for the rest of my 
life." Judging the Judge 
</P>
<P>
 As he steps aside as chief judge of the federal District Court in Los Angeles, 
Manuel L. Real leaves behind some choice comments -- his own, and those made by 
others about him. Here is a sampling. 
</P>
<P>
 In His Own Words 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't Burger King. We don't do it your way here. We do it the way it's 
supposed to be done."

sentencing. . . . I didn't take this job as a popularity contest." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Voices 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a terrible judge. He has no judicial temperament. . . . In 
Real's court, lawyers and defendants leave with a feeling that the whole system 
is capricious."

PROPOSAL WOULD STRIP FAA OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration unveiled a controversial plan Thursday to create a 
government-owned corporation to take over air traffic control from the Federal 
Aviation Administration, contending that it would speed modernization of 
equipment, improve safety and reduce aircraft delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena, who announced the proposal, said that 
a quasi-private corporation could move more quickly than the FAA to buy the 
most up-to-date air traffic control equipment. Insufficient funding and alleged 
mismanagement have slowed down the acquisition of modern equipment, which air 
traffic controllers and airline officials claim would be safer and faster. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, which would require congressional approval, ran into immediate 
criticism from a leading House Democrat who argued that it could jeopardize air 
safety. Aviation industry officials generally supported the plan but 
acknowledged that it would face strong opposition on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena's announcement came nearly a year after the government created a 
15-member national airline commission, headed by former Virginia Gov. Gerald L. 
Baliles, to look into problems confronting the financially troubled airline 
industry. The commission made a series of far-ranging recommendations, many of 
which Pena endorsed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that a government-owned corporation, similar to the Tennessee Valley 
Authority or Amtrak, could raise capital quickly by augmenting public funds 
with private money and through borrowing. It also could move faster to acquire 
equipment because it would not face the bureaucratic burdens of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an agency would have more freedom than the FAA, but would still be 
subject to some level of government oversight. Existing government-owned 
corporations are run by boards of directors appointed by elected officials.  
</P>
<P>
 Pena described the current air traffic control system as the safest and most 
efficient in the world. But, he added, "we can do better." 
</P>
<P>
 A major issue not yet addressed, however, is the source of the money needed to 
operate a quasi-independent system. Pena said that he has set an April deadline 
for resolving that issue and others before the proposal is formally presented 
to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the announcement, the idea drew a vow of opposition from Rep. 
James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), chairman of the aviation subcommittee of the House 
Public Works and Transportation Committee that will consider the proposed 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the final analysis, my deepest fear is that when profit margins start to 
influence air traffic control practices, the safety margins may be eroded, and 
that does not serve the public interest," Oberstar said in a statement. "I 
believe the FAA can take the necessary steps to improve management and 
procurement within the existing system." 
</P>
<P>
 Oberstar earlier expressed concern that airlines would try to get more planes 
into the air traffic system than safety considerations would allow, describing 
the proposed change as "fraught with danger." 
</P>
<P>
 David Hinson, the new head of the FAA, said that stringent government 
regulations on buying equipment and federal hiring rules often prevented the 
agency from buying the most modern computers and advanced radar before they 
became obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm reasonably convinced there is no adverse effect on safety from moving to 
a government corporation," Hinson told reporters. Britain and Germany, he said, 
have had no adverse experience since they shifted their air traffic control 
systems away from direct government operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed revamping of the FAA drew applause from a coalition of major 
airlines, the Air Line Pilots Assn. and the National Air Traffic Controllers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Chip Barclay, president of the American Assn. of Airport Executives, said that 
Pena's initiative "is essential to the future economic growth and technical 
advancement of the air transportation system." He estimated that air traffic 
delays now cost the industry more than $2 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes Pena outlined included: 
</P>
<P>
 * A new evaluation of flight limitations at four key airports -- Washington 
National, Chicago O'Hare and New York's La Guardia and Kennedy -- to see if 
they can accommodate more planes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Faster adoption of a satellite-based navigation system known as the Global 
Positioning System that would provide far greater precision than existing 
systems in pinpointing the position of aircraft.

DECADE OF GROWTH LEAVES GLITTER GULCH GRIDLOCKED; DEVELOPMENT: LAS VEGAS IS 
BOOMING. BUT IT'S CHOKING ON NEWCOMERS SEEKING A HAVEN FROM CONGESTION, SMOG.

 From the cockpit of the Skyview Traffic Watch copter, Thomas Hawley saw the 
week from hell arrive last Friday afternoon in the form of a solid, slow-moving 
steel snake inching along Interstate 15 from the Western horizon all the way to 
the Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 It was New Year's Eve, 1993, the worst traffic day in memory and the busiest 
day in Las Vegas history. Nearly 200,000 revelers choked the city, so many 
visitors that Las Vegas Boulevard was closed and at least one Treasure Island 
hotel bar stopped serving drinks because of the crush of bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't find a room New Year's Eve within 20 miles. No place, no hotels, 
no motels, no nothing," Treasure Island bellman Frank Jackson said. And the 
people! He laced his fingers tightly together and held them out. "This is how 
close people were packed in on Las Vegas Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 The New Year's crowd had barely filtered out when the gadget mongers of the 
International Winter Consumer Electronics Show -- among the biggest conventions 
of the year -- began to arrive late Wednesday night, heralded by oversold 
flights into McCarran International Airport and long, snaking lines for 
taxicabs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city with 11,000 brand-new rooms at three luxurious hotel-casinos, even 
the humble Travelodge -- where warnings against stealing the linens are posted 
in each room -- is near capacity. "I'm here because I can't get in anywhere 
else," one New York City entrepreneur in town for the electronics show said as 
he waited in the registration line at midnight Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 So many people have come to Las Vegas, either visiting the newly capacious 
Strip or permanently fleeing the stagnant Southern California economy, that the 
city is hard pressed to absorb them all. Twice as many people live here as did 
a decade ago. But the roads they traverse have barely changed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers spend twice as much time in their cars as they did five years ago, 
according to the Regional Transportation Commission. At peak times, it takes an 
hour to get a cab and just as long to drive the four-mile Strip. The two-block 
drive stretching from Tropicana Avenue to Flamingo Road can chew up a good 30 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 An ambitious master transportation plan to fix what ails the Las Vegas 
infrastructure is being implemented, but for the short term, the construction 
is causing more harm than good. An estimated 170 public works projects broke 
ground in 1993. "Road Construction Ahead" could be the new city motto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to tear up every damn street in the county as soon as possible," 
said Clark County Commissioner Bruce Woodbury, who is considered the guru of 
transportation planning. "If we hope to catch up with growth, we can't improve 
the system one road at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten worse and worse every year; it can't get better," said cabbie 
Bill Seymour, who every day must navigate Tropicana Avenue and the Strip, 
(a.k.a. Cardiac Corner) the worst intersection in Nevada. "Every back road in 
Las Vegas is under construction for the past six months." 
</P>
<P>
 To many new arrivals -- those expatriates who have helped the population 
double to nearly 900,000 in the last decade -- the changes here contribute to a 
certain sense of deja vu, an edgy feeling of "Didn't I come here to get away 
from the smog and traffic?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I come in to work at 7 a.m. and don't go home until 6 or 7 at night," said 
Mark Albers, assistant general manager of Games of Nevada, a gaming machines 
company. "I blame it on the traffic. It gets real bad between 7 and 8 in the 
morning and any time after 3 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 And it has gotten worse, particularly in the past year. Las Vegas violates 
federal standards for carbon monoxide and particulate matter, and "this winter 
alone, we've had seven days where we've exceeded the carbon monoxide standards 
compared to two last year," said Lee Gibson, planning coordinator for the 
Regional Transportation Commission. "And there are still 45 days left of 
winter." The increase in pollution, he said, is due at least in part to traffic 
and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Once November's and December's visitor figures are tallied, 1993 will most 
likely boast nine of the 10 best months in Las Vegas tourism history, said 
Myram Borders, bureau chief of the Las Vegas News Bureau, which is part of the 
city's Convention and Visitor's Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected year-end rally, she said, comes thanks to Treasure Island, 
Luxor and the MGM Grand hotel-casinos, which opened nearly 11,000 rooms to the 
public in the last three months and contributed significantly to the crunch on 
Las Vegas Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 And this, the first full month of simultaneous operation of all three hotels, 
is already looking good. With the Consumer Electronics Show drawing an 
estimated 80,000 conventioneers to the city, all three hotels are completely 
booked. 
</P>
<P>
 And so is Las Vegas Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rented a car at the airport, but I left it at the MGM Grand," Arthur 
Wagner, president of New York-based Active Media Services, said as he wandered 
through the convention Thursday morning. "I wouldn't dream of driving." 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away from the convention, the Googie-esque Monaco Motel drew its 
own small crowd Thursday afternoon for a slightly different kind of Las Vegas 
experience: a demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials had briefly considered imploding the Monaco a la Steve 
Wynn's bomb-fest at the historic Dunes hotel two months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But they quickly came to their senses. The motel, after all, was being 
destroyed to make way for the Desert Inn Super Arterial, a stop-free roadway 
that should allow residents and visitors to quickly bisect the city by going 
over Interstate 15 and under the Strip. An explosion would simply draw more 
traffic, so they opted for a big yellow bulldozer -- discrete by Las Vegas 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 To "Chopper Tom" Hawley, who watched the Monaco fall, "the long range looks 
good" for Las Vegas. "But for the short term -- at least the next couple of 
years -- there are great problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But will the gridlock in Glitter Gulch drive away the tourists? Not to worry, 
says Jim Cammisa, publisher of the Miami-based newsletter Travel Industry 
Indicators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all looking up for Las Vegas," Cammisa said. " 'Entertainment 
destinations' are in. . . . They're out in front in terms of what the American 
public wants. But from where I sit, they can keep it."

TOP U.S. SKATER ATTACKED, MAY BE OUT OF TRIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in nine months, a prominent woman athlete became the 
target of an assailant Thursday when champion figure skater Nancy Kerrigan, one 
of the favorites to win a gold medal in next month's Winter Olympics in Norway, 
was attacked after a practice at the U.S. championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyewitnesses said a man charged Kerrigan from behind while she was headed 
toward the dressing room at Cobo Hall and struck her two or three times around 
the right knee with an unidentified blunt object, perhaps a tire iron or a 
crowbar. He then broke a large plexiglass door and escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, 24, of Stoneham, Mass., was taken to Hutzel Hospital, where X-rays 
revealed no fractures. Steven Plomaritis, an orthopedic surgeon who treated 
her, said the skater suffered a bruised and cut knee and might be in too much 
pain to skate today in the opening phase of the women's singles competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the most important thing, skating. If I can't, I'll have to deal 
with it," Kerrigan told ABC television in an interview. "I'm OK. It could have 
been a lot worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't lose faith in people. That's just one bad guy. I'm sure there are 
others because it's happened in other sports." 
</P>
<P>
 Limping when she returned to her hotel from the hospital, Kerrigan told her 
coach, Evy Scotvold, that she would not attend a previously scheduled practice 
session late Thursday night because of swelling in the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer said police are searching for the 
attacker, who, one eyewitness said, might have been videotaping Kerrigan from 
the stands during her practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be a planned, premeditated attack," said Atanas Ilitch, vice 
president of Olympia Arenas, which manages Cobo Hall in downtown Detroit. 
"That's my presumption." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. Figure Skating Assn. officials were meeting to determine 
whether their rules would offer Kerrigan an opportunity to earn one of two 
women's berths on the team for the Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, Feb. 
12-27 if she does not compete in the national championships, which serve as the 
Olympic trials. Kerrigan, the defending national champion, won a bronze medal 
in the 1992 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really trying to be optimistic and be strong, but, initially, she was 
terrified," Scotvold said. "She has to realize she is a visible person and that 
for the rest of her visible life she needs protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Protection of athletes has been an issue in sports since April, when the 
world's No. 1 woman tennis player, Monica Seles, was stabbed in the back with a 
knife by a spectator during a break in play during a tournament at Hamburg, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant later revealed that he had acted because he wanted his favorite 
player, German Steffi Graf, to regain her No. 1 ranking. Because of injuries 
she suffered in the incident, Seles has not played in a tournament since. Graf 
is now No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual for women figure skaters to receive threats. In November, 
Tonya Harding, expected to contend here for a berth on her second Olympic team, 
withdrew from a competition in her hometown of Portland, Ore., after an 
anonymous caller said she would "get a bullet in the back" if she skated. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding said in a news conference Wednesday that she since has employed a 
security service to protect her at home but would not reveal whether she had 
arranged for additional protection here this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A Westminster, Calif., man, Harry Veltman III, was sentenced in June, 1992, to 
37 months in federal prison after sending threatening letters to German figure 
skater Katarina Witt, a two-time Olympic gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's agent, Jerry Solomon, said he has had no reason before Thursday to 
be concerned about the skater's security. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gets a lot of letters that say a lot of things," he said. "A lot of 
people out there say crazy things in letters. But there has been nothing to put 
us in a frame of mind to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
 Having completed her practice only moments before, Kerrigan walked through a 
blue curtain that separates the rink from the hallway leading to the dressing 
rooms and was blindsided. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy came running out from behind the curtain, just came bolting," said 
Dana Scarton, a reporter for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette who was attempting to 
interview Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he hit her more than once. Some people have said it was a nightstick 
or a tire iron or a crowbar, but, to me, it looked like it had a whip on the 
end of it. Maybe it was just the way he was swinging it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was running the whole time. He ran right up to where she was, hit the back 
of her knee and then kept right on running out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan collapsed onto a red carpet in the hallway, asking, through her 
tears, "Why? Why? Why me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Dan, picked her up and carried her to a room, where she was 
treated by Plomaritis. Eyewitnesses gave police sketchy details about the man's 
appearance -- white, six feet tall, black cap, black shirt, black shoes, white 
or tan pants. One said she believed that the assailant was wearing a credential 
around his neck that would have allowed him access to the practice arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, a skater known for her artistry, finished third in the 1992 Winter 
Olympics in Albertville, France, behind gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi of the 
United States and Midori Ito of Japan, then followed that a month later with a 
second-place finish in the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But after winning last year's national championship, she skated poorly in the 
World Championships in Prague, Czech Republic, and dropped to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 With renewed confidence after regular visits to a sports psychologist, she 
recently declared herself the favorite not only here, but also in the Olympics.

VIRGINIA KELLEY, CLINTON'S MOTHER, DIES AT AGE 70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virginia Kelley, a woman of unquenchable optimism and flamboyant spirit who 
buried three husbands, battled breast cancer and saw her elder son elected 
President of the United States, died in her sleep early Thursday in Hot 
Springs, Ark., at age 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Active until the end, despite a recurrence of her cancer several months ago, 
Kelley had spent Christmas at the White House and New Year's Eve in Las Vegas, 
where she watched Barbra Streisand perform. According to friends, she was 
eagerly anticipating her annual Opening Day visit to the horse races in Hot 
Springs later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The President flew to Arkansas on Thursday afternoon to coordinate 
arrangements for the funeral, which will be held Saturday. An aide said Clinton 
would continue with a scheduled weeklong trip to Europe for a NATO summit and 
meetings in Moscow with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley's life contained ample doses of the stuff of tragedy -- poverty, 
widow's veils, cancer, the arrest of her younger son, Roger, on drug charges -- 
along with the dramatic rises and falls of her elder son's political career. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the darkest moments she stubbornly refused to adopt a gloomy mien, 
insisting to all that the secret to life was to take whatever happened and just 
keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't let myself dwell on troubles," she said in an interview early in 
her son's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked, as she repeatedly was, what moment of Bill Clinton's political career 
had made her proudest, Kelley offered a revealing answer that she continued to 
give even after he became President: "The night he lost his race for 
reelection" as Arkansas governor in 1980, she would say. "He gave a speech 
thanking everyone, and there was no bitterness. You can never give into 
bitterness." 
</P>
<P>
 That stubborn refusal to accept setbacks as permanent was a trait she passed 
along to her elder son. That, and a seemingly endless capacity for work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driven is the word I'd use for her," said David Leopoulos, a friend of 
Clinton's since childhood. "Ever since I've known her, since I was 8 years old, 
it was nothing but work. She's always, just like he is, driven to get something 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months Kelley had considered, but rejected, taking long-shot and 
potentially debilitating treatments for her cancer, deciding instead to enjoy 
what time she had left, sources close to the family said. 
</P>
<P>
 She had continued to appear outwardly healthy in public as recently as last 
week -- although she had told friends that she found herself tiring more easily 
-- and her death caught friends and family by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Kelley had lunch with friends, called the White House to talk to 
her son and, in the evening, watched a University of Arkansas basketball game 
on television before going to sleep, according to family friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Richard Kelley, a retired food broker, discovered her death later 
in the night and called the President about 2:30 a.m. EST to inform him, White 
House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garland County coroner listed the official cause of death as complications 
from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton stayed up late into the night, calling Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) 
McLarty and other old friends to inform them and reminisce, the White House 
said. At the morning White House senior staff meeting Thursday, McLarty 
eulogized her as a "remarkable woman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton saw her husband off to Arkansas with a hug 
and kiss as he boarded a helicopter on the White House's South Lawn. She and 
their daughter, Chelsea, are scheduled to join him today. Roger Clinton flew 
from Los Angeles on Thursday to join the rest of the family for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time in less than 10 months that Clinton has traveled to 
Arkansas for memorials, having buried his friend Vince Foster and his wife's 
father, Hugh Rodham, last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley stood in sharp contrast to the demure, colorless, television-era 
characters who dominate modern politics -- with her shock of white hair set off 
against a black bun, eyebrows painted into a thin, high arch and a bold 
horseshoe-shaped diamond ring on her finger to display her passion for betting 
on the ponies. 
</P>
<P>
 During the presidential campaign, reporters calling her for the first time 
would often be startled by an answering machine message informing callers that 
"if I'm not here, I'm probably down at the race track." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a woman who traveled through life at her own velocity, flying her own 
colors," said television producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, a close Clinton 
family friend. "She managed to wring every drop of joy she could from her 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 The life was one in which the joy mixed often with pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first son was born four months after his father, William Jefferson Blythe, 
died in a car accident in 1946. The couple had barely lived together because 
Blythe had been drafted into the Army shortly after their marriage in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When her child was 2 years old, Kelley left him in the custody of her parents 
in the small town of Hope, Ark. -- where her father owned a grocery store -- 
while she traveled to New Orleans to train for a job as a nurse-anesthetist at 
the city's Charity Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody who loses a husband thinks they'll never get married again," she 
said in a 1991 interview. "I thought: 'My goodness, this child will be looking 
to me' " for support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most difficult thing I ever did," she said, referring to the 
separation from her son. "I'd be working, putting a child under (anesthesia), 
and tears would be streaming down my cheeks thinking about my own child." 
</P>
<P>
 After completing her training, Kelley returned to Arkansas and shortly 
thereafter married Roger Clinton, a car dealer from Hot Springs. Clinton was 
the father of her second child. He beat Kelley during bouts of drunkenness, 
with the couple divorcing and remarrying during a union that lasted 17 years 
until his death from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 A third husband, Jeff Dwire, a hairdresser, died of complications from 
diabetes after only a few years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 As for her fourth husband, whom she married in 1982, she once laughingly told 
a reporter: "I warned him I was probably a jinx." The two lived in a cottage 
next to a small lake outside Hot Springs, along with a large dog that lived out 
back in a doghouse covered with old Clinton political placards. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley was a constant of Clinton's many political campaigns -- walking 
precincts to knock on doors, stuffing envelopes, answering phones. 
</P>
<P>
 During the presidential campaign, she and her husband led a contingent of 
Arkansans to New Hampshire to canvass the state for her son, and "at every 
moment while we were down, she would come into campaign headquarters and pump 
everybody up," said Richard Mintz, a former campaign official who is now a 
spokesman for the Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the times were really rough, she would help pump him up too," he said, 
referring to Clinton. "She was, perhaps, the world's greatest optimist."

CLINTON AIDES SEE RISK IN SHIELDING LAND DEAL FILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Advisers to President Clinton have warned him that by using the legal process 
to help keep his investment records secret, he runs the risk of damaging his 
credibility in the controversy over the tangled Whitewater real estate venture, 
officials inside and outside the White House said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some advisers to the President concede that failing to reveal the existence of 
a subpoena for the records for two weeks was a "huge mistake" that damaged 
Clinton politically. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complications for the White House arose Thursday night when it was 
learned that Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has indicated in recent days that she would 
seek appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the Whitewater matter 
-- if Congress reinstitutes the law making such action possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the independent-counsel law, which expired in December, 1992, the 
attorney general could ask a three-judge panel to select a counsel and chart 
his or her mission for cases involving high-level Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate has passed a bill reinstituting the law. The measure is awaiting a 
vote by the House. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press briefing Thursday, Reno said she still would be responsible for the 
case if she selected an independent counsel and that she would prefer to leave 
the case in the hands of the three career attorneys now handling it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, the strategy for now is to try to mount a vigorous public 
defense while protecting all documents from release to congressional 
investigators and the media. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is particularly adamant about shielding 
family records from disclosure, according to knowledgeable sources. She prefers 
to endure the pain of the current outcry rather than allow what she deems an 
abhorrent invasion of privacy, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some top White House aides argue that even though the Clintons may be 
justified on legal grounds in withholding the papers, it is politically 
untenable for them in the current climate. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves the Clintons' investment in Whitewater Development Corp., a 
project to develop vacation property in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. The 
Clintons were 50-50 partners with James B. McDougal, owner of the failed 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater and Madison Guaranty are the subject of a Justice Department 
criminal investigation that seeks to learn whether any of the S&L's funds were 
illegally diverted to the real estate deal or to Clinton's political campaigns 
while he was governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One senior adviser to the President warned that the Clintons will "keep 
bleeding" through continued questions about their financial affairs until they 
share their records with Congress and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Another top aide said Thursday that the Clintons were in a political vise, 
squeezed by demands for their papers and a desire to protect their privacy and 
the integrity of the ongoing criminal investigation of McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're trying to balance in all of this the President's and First Lady's 
rights," said the aide, who asked that he not be identified. "Even if they are 
the President and the First Lady, just because someone makes a charge, they 
don't have to turn over everything they own; that's a matter of principle. But 
we recognize that from a political point of view, we've made it look bigger 
than it is." 
</P>
<P>
 That is a lesson that countless politicians have learned, and Clinton in 
particular should know that a public figure, especially a President, has 
virtually no private life and cannot dodge questions merely by asserting a 
right to privacy, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other White House advisers insist that the Clintons have done no wrong and 
that the calls for full disclosure of their private papers are nothing more 
than a Republican-driven witch hunt that should be resisted at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're voluntarily turning over more records than anyone has asked for," White 
House political adviser Paul Begala said. "This is like shadow boxing. There 
are no charges. There are no allegations. This whole thing just mystifies and 
frustrates me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton strategy is one that has been used by public officials in a number 
of cases in order to shelter what they consider private aspects of their lives. 
Even when successful, it can lead to drawn-out battles, sometimes with 
significant political damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading Republicans on Thursday accused the Clintons of "colluding" with the 
Justice Department to conceal evidence of possible crimes and of stonewalling 
congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mind-boggling to think that the White House and the Justice Department 
would work together in a matter that might involve some criminal activity," 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said in one of a series of television 
interviews. "I don't know of any precedent for this." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior House Banking Committee staff member said it appears that the White 
House is using a grand jury subpoena as a means of limiting, not furthering, 
disclosure of relevant material. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to set up a wall, to say they're not targets and they're 
cooperating to get the bad guys," the aide said. "They're just going to pour 
everything they can into the grand jury and then say any release would threaten 
a pending investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the subpoena, the papers may only be viewed by Justice Department 
officials and are less likely to be made public. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce R. Lindsey, the White House point man on the Whitewater affair, said 
that when the Clintons' personal lawyer, David E. Kendall, approached the 
Justice Department on Dec. 23 to offer to turn over papers on the case, he was 
told that the agency was in the process of seeking a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall and Justice Department lawyers then negotiated the terms of the 
request for documents to include more information than the White House 
originally intended to produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey called that evidence of the Clintons' good-faith effort to provide 
more information than required; Republican critics charged that it is an 
attempt to protect a larger cache of Clinton papers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Thursday press briefing, Reno cited the possibility that the 
independent-counsel law, which she strongly supports, will be revived as an 
argument against letting her name an investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Dash, who served as chief counsel to the Senate committee that 
investigated the Watergate scandal, said that eventually Clinton and Reno will 
be forced by public and political pressures to name an independent 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically we have seen that the Justice Department, even operating with 
integrity and good purpose, when it investigates its own Administration, the 
public won't accept the result. Most people will say it was just a whitewash 
and a cover-up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned from Watergate and Iran-Contra -- which were true scandals, while 
this one may not be -- that whenever you put a cloud on the President, it 
always festers when it looks like they're trying to keep the facts from coming 
out," he said. "The only way out is to put it under an independent 
investigator. They will find that politically, strategically and honestly,

COLUMN ONE; ASIA'S PEARL IS LOSING ITS LUSTER; CAPITALISM HAS DONE TO HANOI 
WHAT DECADES OF WARFARE, EVEN B-52 BOMBERS, FAILED TO DO: THREATEN THE 
ARCHITECTURAL CHARM OF A CITY TREASURED AS A VENERABLE, IF MILDEWED, MUSEUM 
PIECE.

 Do Duc Hien lives in the ancient city here, a warren of tiny, crumbling houses 
packed together on narrow streets first settled nearly 1,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, entrepreneur Hien tore down his wooden house and replaced it with a 
$50,000, four-story "mini-hotel" built of reinforced concrete, with a satellite 
dish perched on the roof. His building now towers over his neighbors and stands 
out like a nuclear submarine in the Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything about architecture," Hien conceded. "It has a tile roof 
like all the rest. I don't think it looks that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Capitalism has finally accomplished what decades of warfare, even fleets of 
U.S. B-52 bombers, failed to do: change the face of Hanoi. The city's Communist 
leaders are caught in a classic dilemma of whether to permit desperately needed 
development or take steps to preserve the look of the city before it disappears 
entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 The capital of Vietnam is a venerable museum piece, a place where time stood 
still. Because of a period of isolation that began shortly after World War II 
and ended only a few years ago, Hanoi emerged crumbling and mildewed but 
substantially unchanged from what it looked like in the 1940s, when it was an 
outpost of French colonial rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Vietnamese and foreign experts consider Hanoi an Asian pearl, untouched 
by the modern horrors of boxy office buildings, condominium developments and 
bumper-to-bumper traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoi has two distinct historic areas -- an ancient city settled in the 11th 
Century and a much larger French quarter established in the period 1880-1930 in 
an area near the ancient city. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest building in the city is the baroque Opera House, modeled on the 
Paris Opera and completed in 1912. The French quarter is lined with the 
delightful gingerbread-style houses familiar in the north of France, all laid 
out on wide, tree-lined boulevards where the loudest sound is the gentle tinkle 
of bicycle bells. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important to the Vietnamese is the ancient quarter near Hoan Kiem 
Lake, built on 36 streets still named for the artisans who lived there, such as 
Shoe Street, Basket Street, Gold Street. The district is filled with classic 
"tube houses," a kind of horizontal apartment building, many of which are more 
than a century old. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 40 years, people were not allowed to repair or build houses," said Cao 
Xuan Huong, secretary general of Vietnam's Union of Architects. "Now there is a 
conflict between preserving tradition and daily life. I'm afraid that daily 
life will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 As preservationists see it, Hanoi is under attack on two fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 The first assault came mainly from residents themselves; they have been freed 
by capitalist-style economic reforms enacted in 1987 to earn money and invest 
it as they please. The change has triggered a building frenzy in Hanoi, where 
land prices have skyrocketed tenfold in five years. The road from the airport 
is lined with houses under construction, and many existing homes have an 
extension on the side or even a new floor on top. The city's population of 1 
million is expected to reach 1.5 million in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The other assault comes from foreign developers, who view the Vietnamese 
capital as one of the last undeveloped cities in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hanoi is thronged by foreign business people eager to trade here -- 
and an even greater boom is expected when the American trade embargo eventually 
ends -- there is still only one Western-style hotel, little office space and 
virtually no vacant housing. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, at least eight major building projects have been approved, 
including several in the French quarter; Singaporeans, for example, plan to put 
two 20-story office towers on the site of the "Hanoi Hilton," the infamous 
prison used to house downed American aviators during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen Lan, chief architect of Hanoi, complained at a seminar in December that 
he has come under tremendous pressure from within the government to approve 
huge investment projects because they mean modern development for Vietnam and 
offer prospects for thousands of jobs to a land plagued by mass unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 While the country wants the development, there is a growing movement of 
Vietnamese and foreign advisers who want to make it blend in with Hanoi's 
cultural heritage rather than obliterate that heritage, as has happened in such 
other Asian cities as Bangkok and Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
 To preserve the capital's heritage, the Hanoi People's Committee approved 
sweeping regulations in December for the ancient sector of the city, forbidding 
owners from changing buildings without government approval. But in a land where 
police earn less than $100 a month, there is still concern that widespread 
bribery will allow owners to continue tearing down historic houses, which are 
disappearing at a dizzying rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quest to preserve the French quarter, also near Hoan Kiem Lake, city 
authorities have already turned down one project by a South Korean company, 
which wanted to build a 14-story office building clad in gold mirrors at the 
water's edge. It was too much even by the standards of the people's committee, 
whose Soviet-era office not far away is widely regarded as the ugliest building 
in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that, until recently, the Vietnamese preached against Hanoi's 
alien French architecture, regarding it as a relic of a hated colonial period. 
"In the 1960s, extremists believed that the old buildings were not beautiful," 
noted architect Huong. "They wanted new houses." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam's urban experts have drawn up a master plan whose goal is to force 
high-rise development away from the city center, into the West Lake area about 
three miles away. The idea is to make Hanoi low-rise in the center and 
high-rise along the edges. An Asian consortium has already announced a 
$300-million development in the West Lake area, including a 500-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is an angry debate about whether such plans are economically viable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want our city to end up looking like Bangkok," said Ha Van Que of 
the National Institute for Urban and Rural Planning, referring to Thailand's 
overcrowded capital. "If we allow high-rise construction around Hoan Kiem Lake, 
it won't look like a lake anymore. It will become a swimming pool." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Planners have adopted a "30-degree rule," under which an invisible line 
extends out from the lake at a 30-degree angle. No new construction can be 
higher than the line, although there is already a dispute about whether the 
line begins at the lake's edge or center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not for putting the place in aspic; there is an understanding that 
there has to be economic change," said John Goodyear, an Australian lawyer who 
heads the Friends of Hanoi Architectural Heritage International Foundation. 
"But if you put high-rise buildings in the French quarter, the area will simply 
disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 Groups like Friends of Hanoi, financed by international donations, have run 
headlong into plans of foreign developers, who maintain Vietnam is too 
expensive and too risky for them to construct small buildings. "No one with any 
money, brains or experience is going to go in and redevelop unless they get 
economies of scale, and that means high-rises," said Peter Purcell, who heads 
Dragon Properties Asia Ltd., a group developing the site of a department store 
next to Hoan Kiem Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Purcell said he has been forced six times to revise his plan for redeveloping 
the department store site; it now includes a nine-story office building and a 
19-story apartment complex set back from the lake, designed to reflect the 
French style of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the possibility of moving away from the central area, Purcell said 
developers want to be near Hanoi's "clearly identifiable center" of government 
buildings, offices and embassies. "Developers are just not going out into the 
sticks because some government official said that's where they should be," 
Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, the primary backer of Western-style economic 
reforms, has intervened in the debate at least once, overruling planners and 
giving a high-rise office a green light. But planning officials said they are 
hoping to derail some development plans by tying them up in government 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While preservationists fret about keeping the city center intact, other 
planners worry about the impact of modern life on Hanoi, especially as the 
country's transportation leaps into the 21st Century. A Swedish study recently 
found that public transportation accounted for less than 10% of the transport 
in Hanoi, one of the lowest levels in the world. This followed the government's 
decision to cut off subsidies to bus companies, forcing them into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars are still extremely rare in Hanoi, and there are just a handful of 
stoplights. But where there was once an almost silent stream of bicycles and 
the ubiquitous cyclos pousses -- three-wheeled bicycle taxis -- they are 
increasingly replaced by a torrent of deafening motorcycles belching exhaust. 
There are more than 200,000 motorcycles in the city, one for every five people. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Hanoi we have a city that is unique in the world," said Swedish Ambassador 
Mats Aberg. "As soon as you get traffic, with the possibility of air pollution, 
you're going to approach Athens or Los Angeles. Pollution is already taking its 
toll." 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedish study called on the Vietnamese to begin to cope with the traffic 
problem by developing public transportation and imposing limits on private 
vehicles in congested areas in peak traffic hours, measures such as those in 
place in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no keener student of Hanoi's appearance than Nguyen Vinh Phuc, a 
retired history professor at the University of Hanoi who has lived for 30 years 
in the former garage of a French colonial home. The aged Phuc still remembers 
when American planes bombed Hanoi, not in the 1960s but in 1942, when it was 
occupied by Vichy French forces. 
</P>
<P>
 While he understands the need for economic development, he laments many of the 
alterations that have changed the character of his native city over the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cities of Europe are like old ladies," he said in orotund French. "But 
Hanoi has the beauty of a very young and thin girl. It will be a pity when it 
is lost forever."

ZHIRINOVSKY CALLS CLINTON A 'COWARD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky on Thursday called President Clinton 
a "coward" and a "soft man" who should stay home and play the saxophone if he 
is afraid to meet with the top vote-getter in Russia's recent elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of you in the West have become rotten and moldy," the extremist leader 
said. "That is why you are afraid that a new honest and brave man has emerged 
in Russia. You want us to be weak and to rot together with you. . . . Rot 
without us!" 
</P>
<P>
 With his mixture of bonhomie and venom, Zhirinovsky said he is ready to sit 
down for peaceful and friendly meetings with Clinton, as well as with German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand -- but that 
they are all afraid of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who will arrive in Moscow on Wednesday, has said that he is prepared 
to meet with a wide range of Russian leaders -- except Zhirinovsky, whose 
racist, anti-Semitic and bellicose statements have prompted comparisons with 
Hitler and Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to tell him that we should have good, normal relations and he should 
not be afraid to meet me," Zhirinovsky said. "He should not show that he is 
such a coward. He should meet me personally, and I will tell him everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is only one party in this country, tell him that," Zhirinovsky said of 
his misleadingly named Liberal Democratic Party. "Some President of the United 
States of America he is! Let him play his saxophone back home instead of coming 
here to meet with nobodies!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after his election, a jubilant Zhirinovsky had said that he would 
be delighted to meet Clinton and invited the American President to join him for 
a Russian sauna. Zhirinovsky also said in English that his wife would like to 
meet "Madam Hillary." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky headed the national Liberal Democratic Party ticket that placed 
first in the December parliamentary elections with 23% of the vote. He was 
elected to the Duma, or lower house of Parliament, from the city of Shchelkovo, 
about 18 miles northeast of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 After election officials there handed him his lawmaker's identity card 
Thursday, he boasted, "The next ID card I get will be as president of Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Indulging his penchant for colorful language, dark humor and bald threats, 
Zhirinovsky announced that he "did not give a damn" about the Poles now that 
they have forced Russian troops to leave, and said Russians would not lift a 
finger to help the Poles if Germany tried to take back Eastern Prussia, now 
part of Poland. He also called former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev a 
"scoundrel." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even Gorbachev has gone crazy and is saying I am a creature of the KGB," 
Zhirinovsky said. "He is a scoundrel. He ruined the Soviet Union and is now 
tortured by remorse." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Zhirinovsky delivered a diatribe to a Japanese television 
reporter, advocating a naval blockade of Japan if it refuses to sign a peace 
treaty with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to fight with us? Let's fight," Zhirinovsky said, leaning into the 
television cameras. "Tomorrow the Pacific fleet will blockade the Japanese 
islands and you will starve to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan and Russia never signed a peace treaty after World War II because of 
their conflicting claims to the southern Kurils, a group of islands northeast 
of Japan that have become a symbol for nationalists in both counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want the islands? I can tell you you're never going to get them," 
Zhirinovsky said. "Nobody will get a meter of Russian territory." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also lectured a German reporter: "You should have no illusions that after 
you have ruined Russia you will be getting raw materials at rock-bottom prices. 
You are not going to get anything from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Germany should pay World War II reparations to Russia instead of compensating 
Jews for the Holocaust, Zhirinovsky added, repeating inflammatory remarks he 
made in a German television interview earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you paying Israel and saving Jews?" he asked the German reporter. 
"You're paying every Jew, and how many Russians died? Twenty-six million. You 
don't give a damn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was we who destroyed fascism," Zhirinovsky added. "If it wasn't for us, 
there wouldn't be a single Jew." 
</P>
<P>
 During a disastrous European tour last month, Zhirinovsky was expelled from 
Bulgaria, denied a visa to Germany and told he would be persona non grata in 
France.

REHAB PROGRAM PLANTS ORGANIC SEEDS OF HOPE; THERAPY: VENTURA BRANCH OF VICTORY 
OUTREACH HELPS RECOVERING ADDICTS AND CRIMINALS WEED OUT THEIR LIVES THROUGH A 
REGIMEN OF PRAYER AND FARMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few hours of sweaty field work -- dragging a rake across a newly plowed 
furrow -- gave Jonathan Wood a feeling he had never experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 He had not felt it when he was studying for his business degree at California 
Lutheran University. 
</P>
<P>
 Or when he was arrested for selling methamphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
 Or when he was serving any one of his half a dozen prison stints for 
possessing, using or pushing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Victory Outreach's organic ranch, toiling under a brilliant Santa Paula 
sky, Wood felt like laughing and crying -- and changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started thinking about life -- all the bad choices I had made, all the 
wrong decisions," said Wood, 27. "A force out of nowhere just hit me. It was 
wild." 
</P>
<P>
 Wild, perhaps, for Wood -- but nothing unusual for Victory Outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a regimen of Bible study, prayer and hard work, the nonprofit ministry 
aims to help "the hurting people, the drug addicts, the down-and-outers," in 
the words of Pastor Bob Herrera, who started the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory Outreach works best for men and women with religious backgrounds who 
are willing to turn to the Bible for comfort as they struggle to shake their 
addictions, its organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairly severe indoctrination, especially when you're first trying to 
kick the habit; you're basically kept incommunicado," said Jean Farley, an 
assistant public defender who has referred many clients to Victory Outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Herrera started the Ventura County branch of Victory Outreach in his 
garage nine years ago, the program has won accolades from local politicians, 
police officers and former President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Victory Outreach has also earned the support of a Ventura businessman and 
a Camarillo farmer who have helped Herrera achieve his vision of merging drug 
rehabilitation and organic farming on a 34-acre ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drug addiction is a selfish habit, and the men begin to lose that trait when 
they get on the ranch," Herrera said. "They become responsible. They begin to 
worry about how many weeds are out there, how come this end of the field isn't 
growing like that end. Their minds get healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Investor Mel Cummings sold the ranch to Victory Outreach for $500,000 last 
year -- then agreed to carry the mortgage for the ministry, which would be 
hard-pressed to secure a bank loan. "Any way I can help them, I will," said 
Cummings, who is a recovering alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
 A Camarillo company, Corona Seeds, pitched in with several hundred dollars 
worth of vegetable seeds. Owner Michael Newman said he believes in the concept 
of rehabilitation through ranching because working the land can be "very 
therapeutic and very productive, not like pounding bricks or making license 
plates in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its therapeutic value, the ranch helps keep Victory Outreach 
solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 By selling the organic produce at local farmers markets, the ministry clears 
up to $2,000 a month. In addition, the bountiful crops help cut down on 
supermarket bills. Victory Outreach also relies on donations from its 350 
congregation members to support the drug rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ministry members donate their time as well as their money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Herrera cites Daniel Lopez, his "minister of farming." 
</P>
<P>
 A heroin addict for 34 years, Lopez wandered into a Victory Outreach church on 
Christmas Day six years ago -- and has been clean ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 He works on the ranch, overseeing the clients and doing a fair share of grubby 
labor himself. Lopez has turned down plastering jobs paying up to $28 an hour, 
sticking instead with Victory Outreach and its token $50 weekly stipend. 
</P>
<P>
 It is his way of paying back a program that rescued him, he says, from the 
"pit of hell." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed I would die a drug addict," Lopez said. "I counted 12 times that I 
overdosed and woke up in the emergency room. Then one day I was 47 years old, 
and I looked around and realized I had nothing. Even the shirt on my back was 
borrowed." 
</P>
<P>
 When he first encountered Victory Outreach's philosophy of spirituality and 
hard work, Lopez hesitated. "I was thinking, 'Oh, my God, what did I get myself 
into?' " he said. "But I was at the point where, if I had to stand on my head 
for a week to turn my life around, I would have done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on his experience with drug addiction, prison time and street life, 
Lopez can empathize with the young men who come to Victory Outreach. Some 
wander in on their own after hearing of the ministry through friends. Others 
are under court order to work through the rehabilitation program, which runs 
for nine months to a year, depending on an individual's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Thursday, Lopez stopped his shiny orange tractor in the field to 
counsel Wood, a new arrival from Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 They talked aphids and ants, discussed when to pick watermelons and inspected 
a cardboard box full of the summer's last yellow squash. Then Lopez told Wood 
his favorite story -- how he realized, in a flash of insight just a few weeks 
ago, that his infant son, Gabriel, was the only one of his six children he had 
ever cradled, ever rocked, ever played with. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of the story: Everyone makes mistakes, and everyone should get a 
second chance to do things right. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to see you guys make it," Lopez said, "every one of you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Lopez directs his clients in six-hour workdays, which start 
shortly after a 6 a.m. prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hands scarred from years on the streets learn to root out weeds and wield 
hoes. Men who have spent decades strung out on drugs learn to grow and cook 
organic food. City kids who have never seen a zucchini learn to tell the 
difference between romaine and butter lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think, 'Aw, I don't want to work on the ranch today. I could be 
out there on the streets,' " said Robert Soto, 35, who started using heroin at 
age 11 and has been in and out of prison ever since. "But working out here 
gives you time to think about what you really want out of life."

CRITICS DISSECT WILSON ANTI-CRIME PLAN; JUSTICE: LEGAL EXPERTS SAY HARSH 
SENTENCING AS URGED BY THE GOVERNOR COULD BACKFIRE AND INCREASE LENIENCY IN 
COURTS. JUDGES WOULD LACK FLEXIBILITY AND JURORS MIGHT BALK AT SEVERE 
PENALTIES, THEY CONTEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's harsh proposals for combatting crime might play well to a 
violence-weary public. But legal scholars said Thursday that they would strip 
needed flexibility from the law and possibly even backfire by triggering more 
leniency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you are making mandatory sentencing decisions," said William Talley 
of Harvard University's Criminal Justice Institute, "you are making it 
impossible for a judge to say this person is different from someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars note that the United States already has the highest incarceration 
rate in the industrialized world and that violent crime has decreased in the 
last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is very little evidence that increasing the harshness and length of 
incarceration on top of (current law) accomplishes anything," said Stanford 
University law professor Robert Weisberg. "Very often," he added, "it 
backfires." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson on Wednesday proposed life sentences for first-time rapists, child 
molesters and some arsonists, and mandatory life imprisonment for criminals who 
commit three violent felonies or two felonies with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stiff sentences could actually spark jury acquittals and plea 
bargains, Weisberg said, "because actors in the system might just find the 
sentences intolerably high."  
</P>
<P>
 Plea bargains occur when a defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser 
offense than the one initially charged or receives assurances of more lenient 
sentencing in return for pleading guilty. Usually plea agreements are arranged 
to expedite a case. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said California has already become "the 
laughingstock of the world" because its juries are unwilling to convict people 
who are "obviously guilty." He cited the case of the Menendez brothers, whose 
juries have been deliberating for more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very toughness sometimes makes it easy to win (an acquittal)," he said, 
because juries, especially in diverse California, do not convict when they 
believe the sentence does not warrant the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Dershowitz was particularly concerned about Wilson's proposal of life 
sentences for first-time child molesters and rapists, who he said have the 
highest rates of false convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk of innocent people being put away for life is substantial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren said he has qualms about sentencing 
first-time child molesters to life because it might make family members 
reluctant to report incest. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandatory federal sentencing laws that dictate how much prison time a judge 
may order already have produced what Weisberg called "unbelievably harsh and 
unfair sentences" for drug offenders. The sentencing guidelines have prompted 
some federal judges to leave the bench in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 Close to half the inmates in high-security federal prison cells are now drug 
offenders, "and not all of them are that serious," said Harvard law professor 
James Vorenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means you are using the precious resource of prison space for the wrong 
people," he said. "That is the great risk. " 
</P>
<P>
 But scholars generally agree that the crime package probably would survive 
constitutional challenges: The U.S. Supreme Court has placed few restraints on 
the ability of legislatures to decide what is appropriate punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest court has balked at sentencing people who have repeatedly 
committed low-level crimes to life without parole, Weisberg said, but "the fact 
Wilson is talking about violent felonies would probably satisfy (the court)." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal experts said they doubt that Wilson's proposals would deter violence 
because most criminals do not carefully calculate the risks beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA law professor Peter Arenella said many studies have found that people 
contemplating crime primarily try to minimize the chances they will get caught 
and convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But legislatures do not have the resources or the latitude to offset that by 
adding more police, a tactic whose effectiveness is debatable, or by limiting 
constitutional protections for defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 A law aimed at repeat offenders should be structured extremely narrowly to net 
only the most predatory, violent criminals, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is certainly true that a very small number of youthful offenders commit a 
disproportionately large number of violent offenses," Arenella said. "The 
problem is our ability to identify who they are and distinguish them from other 
individuals who don't pose the same kind of risk." 
</P>
<P>
 This problem is magnified for first-time offenders because "we simply lack the 
predictive ability," the UCLA professor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's Weisberg said it might be possible theoretically to write a law 
that would be aimed only at violent criminals proven likely to commit the same 
crimes again, "but it takes a lot of wisdom to devise such a law." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to imprison a lot of people who don't pose such threats -- as least 
they don't after a decade in prison -- to ensure the Richard Allen Davises of 
the world don't get out," he said, referring to the accused kidnaper and 
confessed killer of Polly Klaas. "The cost of doing that may be much greater 
than the benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Dershowitz said the criminals who strike out in most states that have such 
statutes are the "stupid, blundering, career minor criminals." The repeat 
killers and rapists "know how to plea bargain and play the game," he said. 
Still, he said, he believes it would be possible to craft a law narrowly enough 
to cover only serial violent offenders, although no state has yet been 
successful in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "States have never been willing to make it that narrow," he said. "They all 
end up in the political process broadening it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's proposals will not succeed because they attack "the crime, rather 
than the criminal," he said, and "every criminal is different." 
</P>
<P>
 "If every one of Wilson's proposals were enacted tomorrow," he said, "the 
streets wouldn't be any safer."

KEY ASSEMBLY PANEL VOTES TO PUT '3 STRIKES' ON JUNE BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Assembly committee long known for being the killing ground of tough 
anti-crime bills reversed course Thursday and voted to place the "three strikes 
and you're out" initiative on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 With the public's fear of crime on the minds of all political leaders in 
Sacramento, the Assembly Committee on Public Safety also approved four other 
so-called "three strikes and you're out" bills. Each would impose life 
sentences on habitual criminals convicted of a third felony. But none would 
appear on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's turnaround came as officials from Gov. Pete Wilson on down 
worked to enhance their anti-crime credentials. The votes were taken in a room 
packed with television cameras, reporters and parents of children murdered by 
repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee approval of several competing proposals might seem confused, but in 
the end, a measure approved by voters takes precedence over an identical law 
passed by the Legislature. Although most committee members do not favor the 
initiative version, many believe that it would be politically risky to face 
election without taking some action to diffuse public anger over crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three bills call for life sentences without the possibility of parole for 
three-time losers. Two, including the initiative proposal, would allow for 
parole, but not before a three-time loser serves 20 to 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire bundle will go to the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, where 
members will attempt to reach a compromise on the measures and send a single 
bill to the floor, plus the measure to place the three strikes initiative on 
the June ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have to be a Pollyanna not to understand the politics involved," said 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, a supporter of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year ago, the committee turned down "three strikes" legislation by 
Assemblymen Bill Jones (R-Fresno) and Jim Costa (D-Hanford). They had 
introduced it on behalf of Mike Reynolds, a portrait photographer whose 
18-year-old daughter, Kimber, was murdered by a parolee outside a Fresno 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Refusing to accept defeat, Reynolds, 49, responded with a drive to place an 
initiative on the November ballot. The measure gained momentum with the highly 
publicized murder of Polly Klaas, and Reynolds received endorsements from 
political leaders as well as crime victims including Marc Klaas, Polly's 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Costa returned to the committee Thursday with a replica of last 
year's bill, and told lawmakers they would accept no changes. When committee 
Chairman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos) offered his support for placing it before the 
voters in June, they and Reynolds agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Reynolds was skeptical that the full Legislature would vote to place 
the initiative on the June ballot. He vowed to press ahead with his efforts to 
place the initiative on the November ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know who I trust," Reynolds said. "I trust the people of this state. We 
need to still proceed with the initiative drive and redouble our efforts. It's 
unfortunate that this Legislature has a history of only responding to 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) helped engineer the move to 
place the measure on the June ballot even though he opposes Reynolds' idea as 
too costly. Brown opposes the initiative but has said he supports placing 
Reynolds' measure on the June ballot. Brown helped ensure the bill's passage by 
naming moderate Assemblyman Mike Gotch (D-San Diego) to the committee on 
Thursday. Gotch voted for all five measures -- as did all other committee 
members except Tom Bates (D-Berkeley), who abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, among the most outspoken supporters of anti-crime measures, noted 
that similar bills could have been passed "10 years ago by many of the people 
in that committee right now, and I hope folks understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes people being killed in tragic circumstances to get those elected to 
office to take these things seriously. I'm offended by it," Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some doubt whether the initiative slated for the June ballot could 
become law even if voters approved it. The Legislature can put proposed 
constitutional amendments to a statewide vote, but in an interview after the 
hearing, Tony Miller, chief deputy secretary of state, said the state 
Constitution specifies that legislators can only make statutes by passing them 
and sending them to the governor for approval.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take some creative lawyering and that may not be enough," 
Miller said, adding that such a move has not been attempted since the 1930s. 
"It may be an unlawful delegation of power. That's a theory that has been along 
for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Carrington, an aide to the governor on criminal justice issues, appeared 
before the committee to say Wilson supported whichever bill would create the 
"widest net." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the proposals, one by Assemblyman Richard K. Rainey (R-Walnut Creek), a 
former Contra Costa County sheriff, appeared to have the bulk of the political 
support. Unlike the initiative, Rainey's bill specifies no parole after a third 
conviction of a serious felony. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed initiative says people who have committed two prior serious or 
violent felonies could be imprisoned for life if they commit a third felony, 
whether or not it is defined by the Penal Code as serious or violent. Some 
opponents say it could result in a life sentence for someone who commits 
relatively minor crimes such as shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Another proposal, by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), differs from the 
others by requiring a life sentence without parole for people who commit a 
second offense against children. He also seeks life sentences on three-time 
losers who commit violent or serious felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent felonies include such crimes as murder, rape, attempted murder, child 
molestation and arson. Serious felonies includes all the violent felonies, plus 
such crimes as selling drugs to a minor.

SAILORS' 1944 COURTS-MARTIAL UPHELD; MILITARY: NAVY HAD BEEN ASKED TO VOID 
RULINGS ON RACIAL GROUNDS. THE 258 MEN DISCIPLINED FOR REFUSING TO LOAD 
AMMUNITION AFTER AN EXPLOSION WERE BLACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Navy refused a request Thursday that it overturn on racial grounds the 
1944 courts-martial of 258 black sailors who had refused to load live shells at 
the Port Chicago, Calif., ammunition depot two weeks after a huge explosion 
that killed 320 other men. 
</P>
<P>
 After a full-fledged review, Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton upheld the 
50-year-old judicial action, concluding that although the sailors had had "a 
reasonable basis for fear" after the initial explosion, there was no evidence 
that racial prejudice had tainted the trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the California congressional delegation, who had backed legislation 
requiring the Navy to review the case, expressed dismay at the ruling, arguing 
that in view of the danger, the sailors' action was "not an act of rebellion, 
but an act of self-preservation." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the black sailors who were involved in the 1944 incident said that 
they were ordered back to work while white sailors were excused from returning. 
"What they did back then was prejudice," Percy Robinson, 69, one of the seamen 
involved, told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident followed a July 17, 1944, explosion that blew up two Navy 
ammunition ships, leveled portions of Port Chicago and resulted in the highest 
single wartime loss of life within the continental United States. The depot is 
now the Concord Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the men involved were on the base during the July 17 explosion, and 
some were injured in the blast. When they were ordered to resume their loading, 
in early August, 206 of them initially balked, contending that it was unsafe, 
but eventually returned to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 50 who refused to follow orders to return to work were 
court-martialed, tried for mutiny, and sentenced to 15-year prison terms. They 
were released after 16 months on orders from the secretary of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining two were charged with unauthorized absences. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all but a handful of the 258 were given bad-conduct discharges -- 
including the 50 convicted of mutiny -- most later were returned to duty and 
received honorable discharges of various degrees, with no loss of veterans 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 As was the custom in the U.S. armed forces at the time, the black sailors were 
assigned to menial tasks and were segregated from whites in both their work and 
their living facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was brought up for reconsideration in early 1993 after four 
California lawmakers tacked a rider onto the annual defense authorization bill 
ordering the secretary of the Navy to review all 258 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Before reaching Dalton, the appeals were reviewed by a three-member panel 
created early last year by the Board of Correction of Naval Records and by the 
Navy's judge-advocate general, two agencies that traditionally are involved in 
such requests. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, although conceding that the Navy had been guilty of discrimination 
in assigning the sailors to load ammunition, found that prejudice had played no 
part in the courts-martial or the resulting sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 It also argued that although the sailors had "a reasonable basis for fear" 
after the earlier explosions at Port Chicago, the danger that they faced was no 
greater than that faced by sailors in combat. Seventy other sailors followed 
orders and loaded the ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 And the board said that the Navy already had shown leniency in the cases by 
overturning the prison terms and initial bad-conduct discharges and by allowing 
the sailors to continue serving in the fleet. Dalton concluded Thursday that 
the courts-martial were properly conducted.  
</P>
<P>
 A 1989 book by Oakland writer Robert Allen contended that the Navy did not 
allow testimony about either the causes of the explosion or the unsafe 
conditions at the depot. The court-martial board took just over an hour to find 
the 50 men guilty of mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 The four lawmakers who had pressed for reconsideration -- Reps. George Miller 
(D-Martinez), Oakland Democrats Ronald V. Dellums and Pete Stark and Sen. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) -- had argued that the sailors had been forced into 
the dangerous situation "specifically because they were black."

WOMAN SHOT DURING GUNFIRE SCENE IN 'SCHINDLER'; MAN HELD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested a man for questioning in the shooting of a 40-year-old woman 
Thursday during a matinee of the movie "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 James Michael Kirby, 45, of San Diego, was arrested by La Mesa police and 
turned over to the San Diego Police Department, according to a statement from 
the San Diego department.Kirby was stopped by a La Mesa police officer for 
driving erratically. During a routine check of his name, police identified 
Kirby as the owner of the gun used in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant apparently timed the shot to coincide with a movie scene in 
which people were being shot to death, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Campbell suffered a single gunshot wound to the back and underwent 
surgery for several hours at UC San Diego Medical Center, where she remained in 
critical condition Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant fled the downtown theater at the Horton Plaza shopping complex, 
said San Diego police spokesman Dave Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Moviegoers raced out of the packed theater when the shot rang out from the 
seat directly behind Campbell, who was sitting with her husband Richard, a La 
Mesa police officer. Police found a .38-caliber handgun on the floor behind her 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The man fired the shot at precisely the moment that a round of gunshots was 
heard during a scene that depicts the Nazi destruction of a Jewish ghetto in 
Krakow, Poland, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Kirby apparently did not know the Campbells. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Universal Pictures, the film's distributor, said: "It appears 
to be a random act of violence, which we deplore as we do all such acts. We 
have a great deal of concern and sympathy for the victim and her family."

EASTERN EUROPE; ETHNIC TENSION POSES THREAT TO HUNGARIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While most of Eastern Europe is keeping a wary eye on events in Russia, the 
greatest danger to this nation's security emanates from what used to be its own 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current atmosphere of rabid nationalism and Western tolerance of forced 
border changes in the Balkans, suspicions have soared in the countries 
surrounding Hungary that it may seek the kind of ethnic reunion being brutally 
accomplished by the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungarians dismiss the accusations of nationalists in Romania, Slovakia and 
Serbia that the huge Hungarian minorities there want to annex the land where 
they live to the mother state they were separated from by the 1920 Treaty of 
Trianon. 
</P>
<P>
 But assertions from Budapest to the contrary are proving pitifully ineffective 
in easing their neighbors' fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanian nationalists in the Transylvanian region, where 2 million Hungarians 
live, have lashed out at alleged separatist sentiments by removing street 
signs, stifling the media and shackling education in the Hungarian language. 
</P>
<P>
 In the volatile remnants of Yugoslavia, accusations by Serbian radicals that 
the nearly 400,000 Hungarians in Vojvodina province want secession have 
heightened resentment. Many observers fear that has primed the territory for 
"ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hungarian minority in Slovakia is now the most volatile source of ethnic 
tension because of a seemingly innocuous meeting this weekend of rural 
officials from the predominantly Hungarian border zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayors and city council members from the Slovak side of the border are 
gathering in Komarno to discuss a redistricting proposal that would dilute the 
Hungarian community's political clout by redrawing county lines so that no 
single administrative region had a Hungarian majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The congress has sparked virtual hysteria in the Slovak capital of Bratislava, 
with some officials warning that the weekend talks could result in a "blood 
bath." 
</P>
<P>
 Relations between the majority Slovaks and nearly 600,000 Hungarians have 
deteriorated in the year since Slovakia declared independence from the Czech 
Republic and nationalist politicians gained the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a perceived desire for revenge by redrawing of the borders that 
existed before World War I. This is a joke. There is no such desire. But it is 
a very forceful propaganda means," says Miklos Kontra, a linguistics professor 
at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. "The problem is, once this accusation is 
made, everything that happens serves as proof that it is true." 
</P>
<P>
 The self-fulfilling prophecy explains the tempest over the Komarno gathering 
Saturday by rural officials who are mostly Hungarians and are likely to oppose 
a redistricting that would muffle their voice in public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicions that Hungary wants its empire back have been rife since March, 
1990, when late Prime Minister Jozsef Antall declared his aim of working for 
the interests of all 15 million Hungarians. The population of today's Hungary 
is 10 million. In 1992, the government created a special Office for Hungarian 
Minorities Abroad to monitor conditions for those living outside Hungary as a 
consequence of Trianon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the office planned to attend the Komarno gathering as an 
observer, confirmed Deputy Director Istvan Zalatnay. That has only intensified 
claims by Slovak nationalists that Budapest is stirring trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the volatile lead-up to the Komarno meeting, Zalatnay says Hungary is 
more confident that its relations with Slovakia can be smoothed over than it is 
over the prospects for avoiding a clash with Serbs. "In Serbia, the danger of a 
mass migration is imminent," Zalatnay says.

 Williams was recently on assignment in Budapest.

LATIN AMERICA; PERU'S CANTUTA CASE DEFINES NATION'S JUDICIAL FRONT LINE; 
MEMBERS OF THE ARMY HAVE BEEN ACCUSED IN THE DEATHS OF 10. THE HIGH COURT MUST 
CHOOSE EITHER CIVILIAN OR MILITARY HEARINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A civilian prosecutor's charges against eight soldiers accused in the 
disappearance and deaths of nine students and a university lecturer are testing 
this nation's Supreme Court, which must rule whether the military men will face 
civil or military hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial case -- known as La Cantuta after the name of the teachers 
training university just east of Lima -- has come to symbolize the willingness 
of President Alberto Fujimori's administration to prosecute army officers 
accused of human rights violations. Such crimes by the military have gone 
largely unpunished in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Clumsy attempts over the last year to cover up military involvement have only 
pushed the Cantuta case further into the limelight and undermined the 
president's promises to clean up Peru's tarnished human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Peru was mired in a deadly war against the Maoist Sendero 
Luminoso (Shining Path) insurgency. More than 27,000 Peruvians have died on 
both sides since 1980, and the counterinsurgency resulted in one of the world's 
worst records of human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But since Fujimori came to office in 1990, disappearances have dropped from a 
high of 440 in 1989 to 80 or so last year. He has called the Cantuta case an 
"isolated occurrence." 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Cubas, a civilian prosecutor, filed charges in mid-December against 
four officers and four enlisted men linked to the disappearances, including 
Gen. Juan Rivera, who heads the army's intelligence service. 
</P>
<P>
 A military court, which is conducting a separate investigation, then asked the 
Supreme Court to rule whether army or civilian hearings should be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it is a given that it will end up in the military court," said Jose 
Ugaz, a human rights lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that in 1985, a navy officer implicated in the massacre of civilians 
in an Andean village staged his own kidnaping after the Supreme Court ruled 
that he appear before civilian judges. The naval officer, who is believed to 
have fled to the United States, has not been seen since. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cantuta case places Fujimori in a vulnerable position vis-a-vis the armed 
forces, which backed his "self-coup" in April, 1992, when he shut down the 
Congress and judiciary and suspended the constitution. Bowing to international 
pressure, Fujimori called elections for a new Congress, which drafted Peru's 
new charter, approved by referendum last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of Fujimori's administration say the judges, many appointed after the 
1992 coup, have yet to show their independence, and the Cantuta case offers a 
real test of their neutrality. Unlike in the United States, justices in Peru 
are not confirmed by the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, analysts say military support for the coup gave the armed forces, 
who saw themselves as the country's saviors, carte blanche to combat the 
Sendero Luminoso.  
</P>
<P>
 Fujimori has often said that one reason behind his coup was to pacify Peru. He 
justifies the move by highlighting the successes he has scored in the war 
against the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But, Ugaz said, Fujimori's promises to prosecute officers accused of 
wrongdoing have lost him military support. As Ugaz put it, Fujimori "leaned on 
the bayonets so heavily that now they're pricking him." 
</P>
<P>
 The students and lecturer disappeared in July, 1992, two days after a Sendero 
Luminoso car bomb exploded in Lima's Miraflores district; it was part of a Lima 
spree that killed more than 20 people and injured scores of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those who vanished from La Cantuta, a former Sendero Luminoso 
stronghold, have been linked to the insurgency. The university was under army 
control at the time. Violence has abated since the September, 1992, capture of 
Sendero Luminoso founder Abimael Guzman, who is serving a life sentence at a 
navy prison near Lima.

U.N. CHIEF TO SEEK LONGER SOMALIA MISSION; AFRICA: BOUTROS-GHALI BELIEVES HE 
WILL HAVE UP TO 20,000 TROOPS AFTER U.S. WITHDRAWS, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>

 Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali now believes that he can put together 
a force of 15,000 to 20,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Somalia after American troops 
withdraw at the end of March, U.N. sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, according to the sources, the secretary general is expected to 
ask the Security Council in the next few days to continue the controversial 
mission in Somalia -- though in a more limited role. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since President Clinton announced a withdrawal plan last October after 18 
U.S. soldiers died as the result of a firefight, Boutros-Ghali has been trying 
to prevent a collapse of the Somalia operation by urging other countries to 
stay and reinforce their contingents. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, however, U.N. sources have described his efforts as practically 
fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
 Most governments did not want to risk sending their soldiers to an area that 
the Clinton Administration had decided was too dangerous for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boutros-Ghali appears to have finally succeeded in persuading Third World 
countries to promise enough troops to maintain a viable U.N. force. 
</P>
<P>
 There are doubts, however, about the steadfastness of their promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no firm commitments to speak of," a senior U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems are both lack of money and fears of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 A second senior U.N. official said that U.N. members, including the United 
States, are so far behind in their payments for peacekeeping that there may not 
be enough funds to pay the Third World troops. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of this, the official said, "if there is no progress" in persuading the 
antagonistic Somali factions to reach a political settlement, "you may have new 
military confrontation among the different gangs, and this may complicate the 
situation and we may not receive additional troops." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his latest report on Somalia, which will be delivered to the Security 
Council in a few days, the secretary general reportedly recommends that the 
United Nations try to bypass the dangerous capital of Mogadishu as much as 
possible in delivering food and medicine and that it no longer attempt to 
disarm the warring factions in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. troops would still have the authority to use force, but only to protect 
supply lines and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the operation would be reduced as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-November, the U.N. force numbered 29,000, backed up by several thousand 
U.S. troops operating under American command. There are now 3,000 Americans in 
the U.N. force and 9,500 more assigned to Somalia under separate U.S. command. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgium, France and Sweden had announced the withdrawal of their troops from 
the U.N. force even before Clinton set a March 31 date for the departure of all 
U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the dramatic nature of the U.S. withdrawal under fire that prompted 
other countries to decide to abandon the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, sources said that Pakistan, which has 5,000 troops in Somalia, and 
Egypt, which has 1,000, have agreed to augment their contingents by a total of 
5,000 to 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, according to these U.N. sources, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Nigeria, 
Morocco and Tunisia have agreed to remain, provided funds are found to pay 
their troops. 
</P>
<P>
 This would give the United Nations a force of between 15,000 and 20,000. But 
the force would lack the heavy firepower and equipment of the departed U.S. and 
European troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there was a flare-up of violence in Mogadishu. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. military spokesman in Mogadishu said U.S. and Pakistani soldiers at a 
road checkpoint exchanged fire Thursday with a Somali operating a machine gun 
on a truck. The Somali was hit in the chest and was presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian government announced that Boutros-Ghali has 
appointed Lt. Gen. Aboo Samah Aboo Bakar to take command of the U.N. military 
operation in Somalia, beginning Jan. 20.

NO AMNESTY FOR PERPETRATORS OF BALKANS ATROCITIES, U.S. SAYS; WARFARE: ENVOY 
COMMENTS AFTER VISITING A MASS GRAVE. SHE VOWS CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR WAR CRIMES 
TRIBUNAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright vowed Thursday after inspecting a mass 
grave in Serbian-occupied Croatia that the United States will never allow 
amnesty for those who have committed atrocities in the former Yugoslav 
federation, even as the price for a Balkan peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government also pledged $25 million in new support for a war crimes 
tribunal intended to try those suspected of crimes against humanity in this 
region still torn by nationalist war. 
</P>
<P>
 The contribution is likely to breathe some life into the 11-judge panel based 
in The Hague that was proclaimed by the U.N. Security Council last year but was 
granted few resources and little authority to pursue suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Albright's visit to the mass grave at Ovcara, a stretch of desolate, 
refuse-strewn farmland where at least 200 Croatian hospital patients are 
believed to have been executed and buried two years ago, was intended to 
underscore U.S. commitment to the international quest for justice in the 
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing it there was a stark reminder of the horrors of this war," said 
Albright, the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit any part of the former 
Yugoslav federation since hostilities broke out more than 2 1/2 years ago. "The 
fact that people suffer and then end up in something that is basically a 
garbage dump is symbolic of the tragedies of this country and other parts of 
former Yugoslavia." 
</P>
<P>
 While Albright's push for pursuit of war criminals demonstrated U.S. concern 
on humanitarian issues, it came at a time when European leaders are threatening 
a pullout from U.N. peacekeeping efforts and demanding more direct American 
military involvement to end the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Her presence here has served to spotlight Washington's biggest foreign policy 
crisis and its ongoing dispute with NATO allies just as President Clinton 
embarks on his first European tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Albright, declaring the prosecution of war crimes "an integral part of the 
peace process" and vital to fostering any postwar recovery, said the United 
States will never allow the tribunal to be negotiated out of existence, as 
proposed by Serbs at Geneva peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 To emphasize Washington's commitment to the tribunal, John Shattuck, the 
assistant secretary of state for human rights, announced that the U.S. 
government is making another $25 million in professional services available to 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The contribution will ensure that the tribunal "gets off to a strong start," 
Shattuck said, calling on other countries to ante up similar support for the 
first such panel since the Nuremberg court that prosecuted Nazi war criminals 
after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and its West European allies have sharp differences in their 
policies toward the former Yugoslav federation, with the Clinton Administration 
still smarting over British and French refusal to back Washington's proposals 
for stopping the war still raging in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton last spring called for air strikes against Serbian gunners besieging 
the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo and for a lifting of the U.N. arms embargo that 
has prevented only the forces of the Muslim-led government from acquiring 
weapons to defend the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Since West European allies nixed the U.S. "lift and strike" proposal, Britain, 
France, Canada and Spain have threatened to pull their troops out of Bosnia 
because they are increasingly endangered by the raging conflict they have no 
mandate to stop. The 12,000 U.N. troops deployed in Bosnia are assigned only to 
escort humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 French Defense Minister Francois Leotard stepped up the pressure on Washington 
earlier this week by announcing that he will appeal at the forthcoming North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization summit for deployment of U.S. military forces to 
Bosnia to back up existing U.N. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has refused to commit ground troops to the Bosnian conflict 
unless all three warring factions endorse a peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Albright, asked how the U.S. government will respond to calls for more direct 
involvement, insisted it is already demonstrating sufficient commitment, 
especially on humanitarian issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the ones, as you can tell, that are pushing very hard on the war 
crimes tribunal, and we are also holding steadfast on the sanctions, so the 
United States is very much involved in this situation," she said, sidestepping 
any mention of contributing troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The American ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, accompanied Albright and 
Shattuck to the Serbian-occupied territory and was the one who conducted the 
discussions with rebel authorities -- to avoid, as one U.S. official explained, 
meeting with the renegades at "too high a level." 
</P>
<P>
 The self-styled president of the Serbian-occupied region known as the Krajina, 
Goran Hadzic, conceded during the talks that Serbs have committed war crimes 
and even offered to turn over some unspecified suspects for prosecution, 
Galbraith said. But in light of previous pledges of assistance from the rebels 
in Western attempts to resolve the Balkan crisis, the U.S. officials seemed to 
hold out little expectation of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year ago, American forensics specialist Clyde Snow examined some 
remains at the Ovcara site, and his preliminary conclusions prompted a U.N. war 
crimes investigative team to order a thorough probe of the grave's contents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Serbian nationalist gunmen who have occupied one-third of Croatia, 
including the area around Ovcara, near Vukovar on the eastern border, 
threatened the U.N. exhumation team at gunpoint and have blocked further 
probes.

120 BRUSH FIRES OUT OF CONTROL IN SOUTHEAST AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whipped by unrelenting winds and dry weather, the worst brush fires in 50 
years burned out of control today across southeastern Australia. Fires ringed 
Sydney, the country's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 120 fires, most of them blamed on arson, were ablaze in New South 
Wales state.  
</P>
<P>
 Three people, including two firefighters, have died in the fires, which 
started shortly before Christmas. Dozens more people have been treated for 
burns and smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 About 740,000 acres of bush and grassland have been scorched. Weary 
firefighters, most of them volunteers, have given up attempts to extinguish 
fires and are concentrating on saving lives and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate homes in several towns as a 
precaution after meteorologists predicted a fifth day of hot, windy summer 
weather today. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures reached 111 degrees Thursday, and winds gusted over 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires ringing Sydney were threatening scores of houses. 
</P>
<P>
 No official estimate of damage has been released.

EX-ENVOY TO YUGOSLAVIA LEAVING STATE DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Warren Zimmermann, a career diplomat and former U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia, 
is leaving the Foreign Service, apparently in frustration at U.S. policy toward 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher confirmed late Thursday that Zimmermann 
"intends to retire from the Foreign Service." 
</P>
<P>
 In his brief statement, Christopher said nothing about Zimmermann's reasons 
for leaving his post as director of the State Department's bureau for refugee 
programs. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry also declined to discuss the 
contents of Zimmermann's letter to Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmermann's office said the veteran diplomat has decided not to talk to 
reporters for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources said Zimmermann, originally one of the officials who helped design 
U.S. policy toward Bosnia and other former republics of the shattered Yugoslav 
federation, has become increasingly disillusioned at the failure of the United 
States and the rest of the international community to take effective action to 
stop the brutal ethnic warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmermann would be the fifth State Department official -- and by far the 
highest-ranking one -- to resign in protest of U.S. Bosnia policy during the 
past 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 33 years, Warren Zimmermann has devoted his professional life to the 
meticulous and thoughtful promotion of American interests abroad, and he has 
earned the respect he enjoys here and overseas," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 59-year-old diplomat, who first joined the State Department in 1961, was 
Washington's last ambassador to the former Yugoslav federation, leaving 
Belgrade in 1992 after the country had already been torn apart. He was named 
ambassador in 1989 by then-President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 As ambassador, Zimmermann played a role in setting Bush Administration policy 
toward the troubled Balkans. He later became a critic of Serbian aggression in 
Bosnia, but never publicly questioned the U.S. policy of avoiding military 
involvement in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had been a faithful servant of a policy of non-involvement which did not 
begin with the Clinton Administration," a congressional staff member said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four officials who resigned earlier to protest U.S. inaction in Bosnia 
were all relatively junior officers. Marshall Harris, Steven Walker and Jon 
Western stepped down last August. George Kenney quit in August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clinton Administration once advocated allied air strikes on 
Serbian artillery positions, combined with relaxing a U.N.-imposed arms embargo 
to permit the sale of weapons to the Muslim-led Bosnian government, the U.S. 
government abandoned the plan when other members of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry said NATO chiefs of government are certain to discuss Bosnia during 
their summit next week.

ISRAEL, PLO TO RESUME PEACE PLAN DISCUSSIONS; MIDEAST: CHARGES THAT 
PALESTINIANS RENEGED ON AGREEMENT ARE DROPPED. BUT BITTER FEELINGS REMAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After a weeklong quarrel that dramatized the fragility of their original peace 
accord, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization said Thursday that 
they will resume discussions on plans for Israel's military withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip and West Bank and for Palestinian self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 In a compromise meant to restore momentum to the peace negotiations, Israel 
backed away from its angry charges that the PLO had reneged on an agreement 
resolving the main issues that have been holding up the Israeli withdrawal, and 
the PLO pledged that future agreements will not be subject to change. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, the two sides announced their intention to resume negotiations on 
Monday at the Red Sea resort of Taba in Egypt, thus ending an impasse that, 
while not endangering the basic peace accord, has placed the timetable for its 
implementation in serious doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint communique said the next round of talks will be based on those 
disputed "understandings," effectively putting the two sides back to work on 
three key problems -- the size of the autonomous Jericho district in the West 
Bank, control of border crossings into Gaza and Jericho and security for Jewish 
settlers remaining in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, we have agreed to resume in Taba and try to resolve the 
problems," a PLO source said in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a gesture of goodwill, Israel announced the release today of 101 more 
Palestinian prisoners from Gaza and the West Bank as part of the ongoing 
process of reaching a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned that, if the PLO withdraws 
from compromises reached last month in Cairo in negotiations between Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres and Mahmoud Abbas, the chief PLO negotiator, "we will not 
feel we are committed to what we said on certain issues." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting an Israeli settlement in the Jericho area, Rabin said Israel will not 
be pushed into unwise compromises by the timetable for Palestinian autonomy 
laid out in the accord with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no sacred dates," he said. "Every phase has to be negotiated, 
agreed, signed and only then be implemented. . . . I don't see any major 
problem in postponing. The dates are secondary to the purpose of the whole 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Peres said Israel is ready to make changes in the language and style of the 
compromises reached in Cairo but will stand firm on the substance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They learned that when we say that we won't retreat from Israel's security 
needs, we are serious," Peres said, insisting that reopening the talks will not 
mean more Israeli concessions. "It's not a matter of tactics, and it's not a 
matter of haggling. I hope they learned that lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 Bitter feelings remained on both sides, and future negotiations seem certain 
to be even more laborious as Israelis try to spell out every detail in writing 
and the PLO representatives then refer every clause back to PLO Chairman Yasser 
Arafat for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute required dozens of telephone calls and faxed messages between 
Peres and PLO officials, including Abbas and Nabil Shaath, an adviser to 
Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian mediators were again involved, persuading the Israelis that the PLO 
was not reneging. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the spirit of the process, you don't go and change the whole text, but if 
you have amendments to make, that's only natural," a source close to 
negotiations said in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lengthy argument over whether there had been an agreement did set the 
peace process back, the source added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than spending the last 10 days resolving the outstanding problems, we 
had to go back and reaffirm the basis upon which we were conducting the 
discussions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath was more optimistic, saying the outstanding issues are not impossible 
to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we have come a long way . . . and are over the tempest over the claims 
there was an agreement in Cairo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians remain resentful, however, that Israel blamed them for 
reneging on agreements they insist were never reached. 
</P>
<P>
 They attribute the crisis to domestic Israeli politics, hinting privately that 
Peres spoke prematurely in the hope of taking credit for a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 The pause, in fact, suited Rabin politically because it enhanced his image 
among Israelis as committed to ensuring the country's security and not ready to 
conclude an agreement at any price. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arafat, who Israelis said upped his demands after his negotiator agreed to 
key compromises, has also been seeking to show himself to Palestinians as a 
tough bargainer.  
</P>
<P>
 With so much time lost, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are under 
greater pressure to reach agreement on implementing the autonomy agreement so 
that Israel can complete its troop withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho by the 
April 13 target date, handing over the administration there to the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem on Thursday, police shot and killed a Palestinian after he 
stabbed and seriously wounded a soldier.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said Ahmed Abed Wahab, 20, from the occupied Gaza Strip, belonged to 
Islamic Jihad, a radical Muslim group that opposes the peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed a peace accord 
Sept. 13 in Washington, 52 Palestinians have died in clashes with Israelis, and 
19 Israelis have been killed by Palestinians, according to figures compiled by 
the Associated Press.

MEXICAN PRESIDENT WILL CONSIDER PARDON FOR SOME INDIAN GUERRILLAS; UNREST: 
SALINAS MAKES FIRST MENTION OF AMNESTY IN A TELEVISED ADDRESS. ARMY APPEARS TO 
HAVE LAUNCHED A NEW OFFENSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari late Thursday said he is willing to 
consider a pardon for some Indian rebels in southern Mexico as his government 
moved to answer charges of human rights abuses in its conflict with the 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 In a televised address to the nation, Salinas said, "For the poverty-stricken 
(rebels) who have participated in this violent and illegal conduct because they 
were tricked, pressured or even desperate, we will look for benign treatment 
and even consider pardon." 
</P>
<P>
 His comments came as the army appeared to launch a new offensive, firing 
rockets near the town of Cerro Huitepec, three miles southwest of the regional 
tourist center of San Cristobal de las Casas in lush Chiapas state, the 
Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees trickled into San Cristobal despite army roadblocks around the areas 
where the guerrillas, who want land and improved social conditions, are 
believed to be hiding. Military officials say 95 people have died in the 
fighting since the rebels began their uprising on Jan. 1, but reports from 
church groups place the number of deaths closer to 400. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent effort to generate goodwill and alleviate shortages caused by 
the conflict, the government has reportedly sent 20 tons of rice, beans, 
powdered milk and other food into the affected region. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Madrazo, director of the government's national Human Rights Commission, 
set up an office in San Cristobal on Thursday morning and by afternoon had 
received nine complaints, mainly involving disappearances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For safety reasons, he said, commission officials have not yet been allowed 
access to Ocosingo, where the army is suspected of having executed at least 
seven captured rebels. The bodies of the captured guerrillas have been moved to 
the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, where the commission has requested 
autopsies, Madrazo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Americas Watch, the U.S.-based human rights organization, wrote Salinas on 
Thursday to protest the apparent execution-style slayings of at least 21 
guerrillas, the bombardments of civilian hamlets and the killing of a Red Cross 
worker in unclear circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization questioned the ability of the government's human rights 
officials to fully investigate allegations of abuse, especially those in which 
the army is implicated. It urged Salinas to give his full cooperation to 
international human rights organizations who plan to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peaceful and legal protests of the poor majorities in Chiapas in the 
recent past have been greeted with repression, authoritarianism and 
(arbitrariness), as well as with violence from local powers (who act) with 
official impunity," Americas Watch wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 While the violence appeared to have abated in Chiapas, a group claiming to 
represent an urban branch of the Zapatista National Liberation Army, as the 
guerrillas in southern Mexico call themselves, vowed to fight on and threatened 
to attack "the nerve centers of the oligarchy" in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Mexico City Urban Front, in letters to Mexican newspapers 
published Thursday, urged citizens "to humor and protect us" as the group 
fights "for socialism" and against hunger, electoral fraud and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cannot be legal to massacre with bombs our demands for a better future," 
the group said. "We also have a right to speak, but unfortunately the 
government only understands the words of weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, Salinas spoke out against the uprising, calling it 
"despicable" and harmful to the name of Mexico. "Violence does not generate 
more liberty, nor more democracy, but rather hatred and political 
intransigence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas and other government officials, who have contended that the guerrillas 
had help from Guatemalan leftists and other foreigners, said the leadership of 
the insurgency is made up of well-trained, educated "professionals" who, taking 
advantage of historical grievances, have rallied a group of indigenous 
peasants, including 14- and 15-year-olds, to participate in the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas made his remarks after a ceremony in which, as part of a traditional 
celebration of the nation's 1915 agrarian reform law, he handed out titles to 
land long occupied by the recipients, legalizing their claims to the 
properties. The problems of landless peasants that the 79-year-old law was 
meant to solve go to the heart of long-held grievances that turned Indians here 
into rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas has further amended the old reforms, instigating a survey of disputed 
land nationwide and allowing peasants who are part of an ejido , a communal 
farm based on Indian traditions, to divide their land into private property. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also substituted direct subsidies for farm price supports, saying that 
previous policies have not worked. However, the new policies -- less than a 
year old -- have yet to show results. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems of the countryside are evident in Tzibaja, which until the 
guerrillas' New Year's Day uprising was just another poor Indian village 
without enough land to support the 300 or so families who live here. Now, this 
village in the hills above Ocosingo -- where the heaviest fighting of the 
conflict has taken place -- may become a symbol of both the festering problems 
that led to the revolt and the government's efforts to address them. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials promised to examine land disputes in Tzibaja and San Juan 
Chamula, a village near San Cristobal, after speaking with leaders of diverse 
groups in Chiapas on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the fighting, people here are reluctant to discuss their 
disputes. Women in flower-embroidered blouses and beribboned, ankle-length wrap 
skirts shut the metal doors of their unpainted concrete houses as strangers 
walk down the dirt streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are afraid because of all that has happened," said one young man, 
speaking on the condition his name would not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 The village's problem, he said, is land: "We have been asking for more land 
since the time of our fathers, but we get no answer."

U.S. SOLDIERS IN VIETNAM SEARCH FOR MIAS

<P>
 A new generation of American soldiers armed only with picks and shovels spread 
out across 600 miles of Vietnam on Thursday, searching old battlefields for 
fallen soldiers missing since the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The search mission -- the largest since the end of the war -- involves eight 
U.S. teams of specialists totaling 84 members and runs through Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Before now, the search for the remains of American MIAs was concentrated in 
northern Vietnam and Laos, where hundreds of airmen went down on bombing and 
other missions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest search has turned south, to the battlefields of what was South 
Vietnam before it fell to the Communist north in 1975.

FUGITIVE PLEADS GUILTY TO '69 RIOT CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A fugitive member of the 1960s anti-war group Weather Underground surrendered 
Thursday and pleaded guilty to taking part in the 1969 "Days of Rage" rioting. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey David (Donovan) Powell, 43, was sentenced to 18 months of probation 
and fined $500 on one state count of mob action.A charge of aggravated battery 
was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proud to have fought for my country against the criminal government of 
Richard Nixon. And I am glad not to be at war against my country now," Powell 
told reporters before appearing in county criminal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell has been living in Colorado, said his attorney, Jeffrey Haas. He has 
spent most of his time as an activist for Head Start and nutritional programs 
for needy children and has testified before congressional panels, Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges stemmed from the group's demonstrations against the Vietnam War in 
Chicago from Oct. 8-11, 1969. The window-smashing and street-fighting rampage 
injured scores of demonstrators and law enforcement officers and resulted in 
more than 300 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, federal indictments against members of the Weather Underground, 
including Powell, were dropped. State charges were not, however.

STATES' ROLE IN ABORTION AID REAFFIRMED; HEALTH: ADMINISTRATION STANDS BY ITS 
DIRECTIVE THAT SPELLS OUT FUNDING MECHANISM FOR POOR WOMEN IN CASES OF RAPE, 
INCEST. ISSUE STIRS PROTESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite protests from several state Medicaid directors, the Clinton 
Administration announced Thursday it would stand by its requirement that states 
help pay abortion costs for low-income women in cases of rape and incest. 
</P>
<P>
 While a dozen or more state laws allow such expenditures only when a pregnancy 
has endangered a woman's life, Bruce C. Vladeck, administrator of the Health 
Care Financing Administration, insisted that under the Supremacy Clause of the 
U.S. Constitution, federal law supersedes all state statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Congress passed a law loosening the 17-year-old ban on federal 
funding for abortions. The Hyde Amendment, named for its its author, Rep. Henry 
J. Hyde (R-Ill.), permits federal Medicaid money to be used to provide 
abortions in cases where pregnancies resulted from rape or incest. Before that, 
poor women served by the federal-state Medicaid program could receive 
government-financed abortions only in cases where their lives were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration, which strongly supports abortion rights, had hoped to 
eliminate the federal funding ban altogether, but adding the exclusions for 
rape and incest was as far as Congress would go. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fight over the federal funding ban is being watched closely by both sides 
of the abortion issue. They consider it a preliminary bout in what promises to 
be a much larger struggle over the Administration's proposal to include 
abortion coverage as one of the benefits guaranteed under its health care 
reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Administration's interpretation of the new law, abortions for rape 
and incest victims are considered "medically necessary," meaning that both 
states and the federal government must fund them. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladeck gave a detailed explanation of the Administration's interpretation of 
the law in a letter to Arkansas Medicaid Director Ray Hanley, who is also 
chairman of the State Medicaid Directors Assn. In an earlier letter, Hanley had 
protested the Administration directive, saying that Congress' intent was to 
permit states to choose whether to fund abortion in rape and incest cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Vladeck replied that if Congress had wished to make state funding of 
abortions discretionary, it would have added specific language to that effect, 
as it has in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such language it is not an issue that can be decided by the states, 
the federal administrator wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanley was far from satisfied with Vladeck's response. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, he noted that before issuing the directive, 
Administration officials had indicated publicly on numerous occasions that they 
"would respect and try to reconcile state laws" on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the controversy that has surrounded the Administration directive, Hanley 
added, there is "an excellent chance that Congress will revisit this language" 
to make its intentions clearer. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicaid officials in at least two states -- Utah and Louisiana -- already 
have announced their intention to refuse to implement the order. The issue is 
moot in California, where Medi-Cal funds abortion without restriction. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicaid, a program that provides medical care to low-income people, operates 
primarily on federal funds. However, it is administered by the states, which 
also are required to pay for a portion of all services rendered under the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladeck also dismissed complaints by some state officials that the federal 
government was putting a major new financial burden on them without consulting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of state funds involved is negligible because the revision of the 
Hyde Amendment expands abortion coverage to a very small group of women," 
Vladeck wrote. "Those who will now be served as a result of the Hyde Amendment 
of 1993 are poor women who have been the victims of rape or incest, who have 
suffered physical and mental abuse, and who, beyond that, have been made 
pregnant by those acts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hanley had warned that the federal order could leave states 
vulnerable to legal challenges, the legislative director of the nation's 
largest anti-abortion group conceded that abortion opponents would find it 
difficult to overcome in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, 
said that judges traditionally have given "heavy deference" to federal agency 
interpretations of statutes in situations where Congress' intent is questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, abortion rights advocates in several states have mounted legal 
efforts to overturn laws that do not allow abortions in cases of rape and 
incest -- efforts that, if successful, could leave those states without any 
restrictions on abortion.

SHORTAGE IN PRIVATE PENSION PLANS GROWING, STUDY FINDS; RETIREMENT: GAP BETWEEN 
ASSETS, LIABILITIES HIT $53 BILLION IN '92, NEARLY 40% HIGHER THAN '91. 
OFFICIALS SAY PROBLEM SHOULD BE DEALT WITH NOW. 
</P>

<P>
 Private sector pension plans covering 32 million Americans in 1992 fell $53 
billion short of the amounts needed to pay future benefits, a federal oversight 
agency said in a report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined "unfunded liability" is nearly 40% higher than the 1991 figure of 
$38 billion, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. reported, and exceeds by a 
considerable margin projections made late last year. The underfunded pension 
plans had assets of $182 billion and liabilities of $235 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the projected gap has climbed steadily for 10 years, PBGC officials 
emphasized that the new figures did not represent an immediate problem for 
beneficiaries of the affected plans. Should the trend worsen, however, it 
clearly could pose problems for future beneficiaries, they indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "PBGC has ample assets to pay benefits for many years to come," Executive 
Director Martin Slate said. "But the data send a clear signal that we have a 
growing problem which we should squarely address while it is still manageable." 
</P>
<P>
 The PBGC blamed the problem on lower interest rates, which have reduced the 
return on investment of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The PBGC found that underfunding in the 65,000 single-employer plans that it 
insures was heavily concentrated in a small number of companies in the steel, 
auto, tire and airline industries. About 72%, or $38 billion, of the 
underfunding was concentrated in plans sponsored by 50 companies, primarily in 
those four industries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The PBGC noted that three-quarters of the underfunding was in plans maintained 
by "financially healthy" firms and, therefore, did not pose a risk to 
participants. But it found that the remaining plans, which cover about 1.2 
million participants, were under the sponsorship of companies with "below 
investment grade ratings." They accounted for about $14 billion in 
underfunding. 
</P>
<P>
 The PBGC said that the 1992 increase in underfunding was due largely to the 
decline in interest rates, but it also attributed some to weaknesses in current 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures for 1992 were not released until now because the companies have nine 
months after the end of the year in which to file their information, and the 
PBGC takes more time to prepare the data. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of the figures, which are derived from Standard & Poor's Compustat 
database as of Dec. 31, 1992, have come at a time when the Clinton 
Administration is undertaking major efforts to improve pension funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's pension reform efforts were introduced in Congress last 
year as the Retirement Protection Act. Administration officials trumpeted the 
figures, saying they highlighted the need for the proposed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The latest figures underline the need to move forward with these reforms," 
said Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, who also is chairman of the PBGC board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the PBGC report also drew fire from critics, who charged that the figures 
were misleading and the tactics counterproductive. Labeling the report a form 
of "crying wolf," they said that it was designed to draw the attention of 
Congress and the public to what essentially is a non-issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PBGC would like to have a law passed so they have to go around telling 
people there's a crisis," said Paul Jackson, a retired consulting actuary in 
Washington whose clients included General Motors, IBM, Penn Central and AT&T. 
"This is just one more example of the government inventing a problem and then 
solving it, when it's something that's easy to do." 
</P>
<P>
 He called the $53-billion figure "meaningless" unless all the companies whose 
pension plans have unfunded liabilities went out of business and bankrupt at 
the same time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the chief culprit behind the unfunded pension liabilities was not the 
companies themselves but inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, defenders of the PBGC's methods say they support its efforts to draw 
attention to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a legitimate tactic," said Robert Nagle, executive director of 
the PBGC from 1979 to 1982. "There's never going to be any legislation passed 
unless they create some perception of the need for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The PBGC, which is financed by contributions from business, was established by 
Congress in 1974 to guarantee payment of American workers' and retirees' basic 
earned benefits. It insures 32 million participants in single-employer plans, 
and an additional 9 million workers in multi-employer programs, and guarantees 
benefits of up to $2,556.82 a month for participants in failed pension plans. 
The Growing Pension Gap 
</P>
<P>
 Pension plan underfunding -- the gap between assets and liabilities -- swelled 
to an estimated $53 billion in 1992. The total underfunding in 
government-insured, single-employer pension plans from 1983 to 1992: 
</P>
<P>
 In billions 1992*: $53 1991: 38 1990: 33 1989: 27 1988: 25 1987: 22 1986: 21 
1985: 15 1984: 11 1983: 10 * 1992 is the latest year for which figures are 
available

ELDERS ASKS SMOKERS TO ACT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders on Thursday urged parents who smoke to seek 
help in quitting or to indulge their habit outside their homes and cars, 
saying: "Your children are the innocent victims of your addictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Lending her support to a new national campaign against the dangers of 
secondhand smoke to young children, Elders acknowledged that cigarette smoking 
is a tough addiction to break.But she pleaded with parents to think about the 
health consequences of their smoking on their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, as adults, have a choice," she said. "But our children have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency classified secondhand smoke as 
a Group A carcinogen, meaning it is known to cause cancer in humans. Moreover, 
children's exposure to environmental smoke is known to cause lower respiratory 
infections, ear, nose and throat problems and potentially serious complications 
in those suffering from asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, which represents the 
industry, agreed that "everyone is and should be concerned with the health and 
well-being of children," and that smoking parents "may want to exercise common 
sense about smoking in front of their children in the same way they use common 
sense about other exposures and activities."

ATF 'BEATEN DOWN' ON GUN CONTROL, OFFICIAL SAYS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: AIDE TO 
TREASURY SECRETARY DESCRIBES VETERAN BUREAU EMPLOYEES AS RELUCTANT TO CURB 
SPREAD OF WEAPONS. LAWSUITS ARE FEARED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Treasury Department's top law enforcement official Thursday described the 
difficulty he has had trying to persuade longtime employees that tougher steps 
could be taken to stop the proliferation of guns in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Years and years of not being able to fight this issue have beaten down" the 
Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Ronald K. Noble, 
assistant secretary of the Treasury for enforcement, said at a meeting of The 
Times' editors and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to point a finger at other administrations, but there's a 
mentality in ATF that 'we can't do this,' " Noble said. As an example, he said 
ATF officials had been reluctant to confront legal challenges the department 
might face if it refused to issue federal firearms licenses to dealers who plan 
to operate in areas where local authorities have banned weapons sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why can't we say 'no?' " Noble said he asked the officials. "By saying 'yes,' 
aren't we an accomplice to a crime? So, why don't we just say 'no,' and if they 
take us to court, let them take us to court." 
</P>
<P>
 Noble's comments came against the backdrop of an ambitious program announced 
this week under which Treasury -- and what he regards as a revitalized ATF -- 
would impose a 10-fold increase in fees dealers pay for federal licenses. The 
purpose is to reduce licensees, who now number 284,000 nationwide, by 80%. The 
program also would computerize millions of existing sales records for tracing 
guns and for other purposes, and step up background checks on dealer 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent among the steps is requiring federal licensees to obey state and 
local gun laws, thus ending the practice of issuing federal licenses to dealers 
in areas where local laws forbid gun sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble explained that the department wants to weed out hundreds of thousands of 
dealers who buy their licenses solely so they can obtain weapons for their own 
use at wholesale prices, with no intention of engaging in retail sales. The 
purpose is to ease the workload on the ATF's 240 inspectors, who are so 
overburdened they cannot fully enforce federal requirements that dealers 
maintain records for use in tracing weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, some 17.2% of the 54,000 requests for ATF tracing 
could not be completed "because a federal firearms licensed dealer went out of 
business, never was in business, wasn't home, didn't keep records, lost 
records, and so forth," Noble said. Now, ATF is trying to conduct "some kind of 
background check in the nation's high crime areas," and Noble cited with 
approval a program conducted with the New York Police Department over the last 
five months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under that program, face-to-face interviews were done with 227 applicants for 
federal firearms licenses, during which they were informed about the 
requirements for selling firearms in the city. Some 213 withdrew their 
applications, and another three were denied, according to Noble. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development Thursday, the General Services Administration said it 
will no longer permit federal agencies to sell their used firearms to private 
gun dealers. The GSA, the government's housekeeping agency, said it hopes the 
new limitation will curtail the flow of handguns into the streets.

SHORTAGE SPURS EMERGENCY APPEAL FOR DONATED BLOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation is experiencing a critical shortage of blood, leading the American 
Red Cross and blood banks to issue emergency appeals Thursday for Americans to 
donate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are afraid lives will be lost," said Marcia Lane of the American Assn. of 
Blood Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials blamed snowstorms in the East, the Beijing flu that has sickened 
people in at least 17 states, and the holiday season for the shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross has 33,000 units of blood in its national inventory, contrasted 
with a normal level of 67,000, spokeswoman Margaret McCarthy said. The agency's 
usual three-day supply of blood has dropped to one day's worth. Stocks of Type 
O, the most-transfused blood type, are 29% below emergency levels, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have another storm and couldn't transport blood from one region to 
another that needs it, we could have some real, real dangerous situations," 
McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood banks typically experience holiday shortages, but this year was 
unusually low. And, although donations usually jump immediately after New 
Year's Day, they have not picked up this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, blood collections totaled 8,000 units fewer than expected. 
Snowstorms across the East canceled blood drives this week, and other donors 
were turned away because they had the flu, McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen of the 45 Red Cross regions have appealed for emergency blood 
donations: Atlanta; Buffalo, N.Y.; Birmingham and Mobile, Ala.; Charlotte, 
N.C.; Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio; Dedham, Mass.; Detroit, Flint and Lansing, 
Mich.; Little Rock, Ark.; Los Angeles; Miami; Peoria, Ill., and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Another nine cities reported emergency shortages to the Assn. of Blood Banks: 
Dallas; Houston; Tampa, Fla.; Indianapolis; Chicago; New Orleans, and San 
Francisco, San Bernardino and Fresno, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood banks asked people living in the hardest-hit areas to call their local 
Red Cross or hospital to make appointments to donate blood. Donations need to 
be staggered because whole blood has a shelf life of 42 days, and blood 
products such as platelets can be used for only five days after donation.

MODERATES PRESSURE CLINTON ON WELFARE; LEGISLATION: CENTRIST DEMOCRATS IN BOTH 
HOUSES OF CONGRESS MAY INTRODUCE THEIR OWN REFORM BILLS. WHITE HOUSE GIVES 
PRIORITY TO HEALTH CARE ISSUE. 
</P>

<P>
 Disappointed over signs that the Administration is delaying action on welfare 
reform, moderate Democrats in both houses of Congress are drawing plans to 
introduce their own reform bills in an effort to pressure President Clinton to 
act. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite possible people on the Hill will move on their own, not against 
the Administration, but to show there is bipartisan support for welfare reform 
this year along with health care reform," said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman 
(D-Conn.). 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, the Mainstream Forum, an organization of centrist Democrats, is 
planning to send Clinton a letter, perhaps as soon as today, urging him to 
reconsider the apparent decision to delay the introduction of an Administration 
welfare reform bill. "It's clear their feet need to be held to the fire on 
this," said Rob Herman, an aide to first-term Rep. Eric D. Fingerhut (D-Ohio), 
a leader in the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to House members active in the group -- which attracted 77 signatures to 
a letter last October pressing Clinton to emphasize welfare reform -- met 
Wednesday to map out options for moving forward on the issue. "We are seriously 
considering introducing legislation," said one aide who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers agree that it would be extremely difficult for legislators to 
advance a welfare reform proposal without Administration support and with the 
leadership of both houses generally favoring the idea of emphasizing health 
care over welfare reform in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But a visible revolt by moderate Democrats could embarrass the President, 
whose campaign promise to reform the welfare system was a cornerstone of his 
effort to define himself as a "new Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Clinton is under fire from Republican leaders, such as House Minority 
Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who accuse him of backing down from the issue to 
avoid a fight with Democratic liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 An interagency Administration task force has substantially completed 
recommendations for a major overhaul of the welfare system, including 
requirements that all recipients work after two years on the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the past few weeks, White House officials have repeatedly signaled 
that the Administration intends to delay introduction of welfare reform 
legislation until later this year to avoid conflict with the health care bill, 
which is expected to require a vast amount of time and effort in Congress and 
the executive branch. One ranking White House official said this week that the 
welfare bill might not be introduced until as late as September. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have argued that attempting to push welfare and health 
care reform simultaneously would overload the tax-writing committees in both 
Houses, which must consider both bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also have acknowledged that they fear welfare reform could alienate 
liberal legislators whose votes the Administration needs to pass health care 
reform. In November, 87 House liberals wrote Clinton, criticizing many aspects 
of the proposed reform, including the two-year time limit. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Lieberman said that he will introduce Senate legislation soon 
that would advance the welfare reform effort "in a step-by-step way." Although 
the bill isn't in final form, he said, he intends to propose that the federal 
government underwrite intensified experiments in the states with a series of 
reforms aimed at changing incentives for welfare recipients. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Denying additional benefits to women who have children while already on the 
rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Requiring welfare recipients to keep up their children's school attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowing women who cooperate in obtaining child support awards to keep more 
than $50, the share the government gives them now from each payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman said he also is interested in encouraging some states to experiment 
with conservative author Charles Murray's proposal to cut off welfare benefits 
entirely for children born out-of-wedlock. Such an experiment, Lieberman said, 
might start by cutting off welfare solely for teen-age mothers, as proposed in 
legislation introduced by House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist 
Democratic think tank, says that the uprising among Democratic moderates flows 
from the conviction that the Administration has misjudged the demand for 
welfare reform in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many legislators say they need a radical welfare reform proposal to campaign 
on," he said.

 A prestigious commission called for significant changes in the initiative 
process, recommending that the Legislature vote on proposed ballot measures 
before they are placed on the ballot.If lawmakers approve them, such measures 
would become law without being on the ballot. Those measures rejected by the 
Legislature would go on the statewide ballot. The commission, headed by former 
Legislative Analyst A. Alan Post, also recommended that lawmakers be free to 
make changes to the proposed initiatives, as long as the proponents agree. 
Initiatives would still have to qualify by signature petitions as they do now. 
Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) said he intends to put the recommendations 
into the form of bills to be considered by the Legislature this year.

 Two Marines have been discharged and three more might be dismissed for 
allegedly posing nude for a man who says he ran a gay pornography ring, Camp 
Pendleton officials announced. In all, 10 enlisted Marines are accused of 
involvement with Luciano Ceballos, a convicted forger who has been in the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in San Diego since September on a parole 
violation.Military investigators accused all 10 of posing nude, a violation of 
military law, but none is accused of engaging in sexual acts with others. Of 
the 10, two were discharged, three are undergoing proceedings that could result 
in discharges, one was discharged for unrelated misconduct, one received 
administrative pun ishment and two are awaiting a decision on possible 
punishment, the Marine Corps said. The status of the 10th was not disclosed. 
The Marine Corps released a statement detailing the status of the nine Marines 
after officials issued an incorrect statement Tuesday that all nine had been 
given general discharges, a step below an honorable discharge.

 Any person seeking job placement services from state agencies will be required 
to provide proof of U.S. citizenship as of Monday. A certified U.S. birth 
certificate or any of two dozen other documents will be accepted as proof of 
citizenship."California is struggling with the costly implications of a failed 
federal immigration policy," Gov. Pete Wilson said in a news release. "While we 
look forward to the federal government implementing real immigration reform, we 
in California have taken the responsibility of eliminating state services that 
act as a magnet for illegal immigration." The new rule is the result of a bill 
sponsored by Sen. Newton R. Russell (R-Glendale) that was passed by the 1993 
Legislature and signed into law by Wilson. Employment services offered by the 
state include job placement or referrals, job search workshops, job training, 
counseling, testing and resume writing workshops.

 Two suspicious packages spotted Thursday in the lobby of a building in the 
World Trade Center were not bombs and the area was later reopened, authorities 
said.

 Police bomb squads were sent to the scene near the parking garage where a 
powerful bomb went off last Feb. 26, killing six people and injuring more than 
1,000 others.

 The bomb squads determined that the bags in the lobby of No. 4 World Trade 
Center, which is not one of the landmark's two towers, did not contain 
explosives, a Port Authority police official said.

BROTHERS WIN $104,000 IN SUIT AGAINST HUNTINGTON BEACH POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury awarded $104,000 Thursday to two brothers who a judge ruled were 
illegally detained by three Huntington Beach police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The award came after Orange County Superior Court Judge Logan Moore took the 
unusual step of issuing a directed verdict in favor of Roberto Ayala Garcia, 
38, and his brother Miguel, 30. The judge then asked jurors to decide how much 
money the Garcias should receive in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers accused the officers of pointing pistols at them before 
handcuffing and assaulting them outside their apartment in 1988. The officers 
had come to retrieve a woman's belongings from the home, and the Garcias were 
not charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's foreman, Larry Hamlin, said Thursday night that most jurors 
considered the officers' actions "absolutely outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 "They used Gestapo tactics against these guys," Hamlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson said she was surprised by the 
award. She defended the officers involved, saying they had gone to assist in "a 
domestic violence situation where a woman was in danger." The mayor said the 
city had not decided whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers sued the city and officers Thomas Trembley, Steven Overcast and 
Raymond Villescas after the incident at the Garcias' apartment on Beach 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, the brothers allowed a woman who had been romantically 
involved with Roberto Garcia into their home on June 16, 1988, to retrieve 
clothes. Later that day, the woman called police to report that Roberto Garcia 
was dealing drugs and kept guns in the apartment, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still later, the woman met the three police officers outside the apartment, 
and a police employee telephoned the Garcias and ordered Roberto to step 
outside, the suit said. When he went to the front door, he saw the three 
officers pointing pistols at him and was handcuffed and searched outside, the 
suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers had Roberto call for his brother, who was searched and handcuffed 
when he came outside, the suit said. The Garcias were placed on the ground 
while the officers went into the apartment with the woman and conducted a 
search, according to the suit. The officers left after removing the handcuffs, 
the suit said.

STATE GUN SALES SET RECORD, LUNGREN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren said Thursday that Californians -- many of them losing 
confidence in government's ability to protect them -- purchased a record 
665,229 firearms last year, about two-thirds of them handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 The total represented an increase of 22% over 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said the reasons for the rush to arms vary, but "clearly many 
thousands of Californians feel they are not adequately protected by law 
enforcement and need a firearm for security." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general said he was troubled by what he called "the lack of 
confidence in our criminal justice system which has convinced so many 
Californians to buy guns for protection from crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said that except for 1991, sales of handguns have soared substantially 
since 1986. In 1992, record sales of 367,375 revolvers and pistols were 
reported. Sales jumped to a high of 448,247 last year, an increase of 22%, 
Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of all types of guns hit 559,608 in 1992, spurred in part by the Los 
Angeles riots and establishing another record. But in 1993, the increase soared 
again, 18.9% to 665,229, the attorney general said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren also reported that the state law requiring a 15-day waiting period and 
background check on the purchasers of handguns, rifles and shotguns blocked 
sales to a record 6,509 applicants last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Of those rejected last year, 3,210 applicants had a history of criminal 
violence, including 51 who had been convicted of murder. The total also 
included 410 people disqualified because of mental health histories, 268 
because of legal restraining orders against them, and 219 because they were 
minors. Handgun Sales in California 
</P>
<P>
 Handgun sales have been generally on the rise in California since 1986.

BROTHERS WIN $105,000 IN O.C. POLICE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A jury on Thursday awarded almost $105,000 to two brothers who said they were 
assaulted by three Huntington Beach Police officers in what the trial judge 
called an "unlawful" violation of the brothers' constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The award came after Orange County Superior Court Judge Logan Moore took the 
unusual step of halting the jury trial and issuing a verdict in favor of 
Roberto Ayala Garcia, 38, and his brother Miguel, 30. The judge then asked 
jurors to decide how much money the Garcias should receive in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garcias accused the officers of pointing pistols at them before 
handcuffing and assaulting them outside their apartment in 1988. The police had 
come to retrieve a woman's belongings from the home, and the Garcias were not 
charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's foreman, Larry Hamlin, said Thursday most jurors considered the 
officers' actions "absolutely outrageous."  
</P>
<P>
 "This scares the hell out of me," said Hamlin, a truck driver who lives in 
Orange. "They used Gestapo tactics against these guys. It is my personal 
feeling that they were treated that way because they were poor Mexican 
Americans. If it was in my white neighborhood, they would not have done that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlin said he and some other jurors wanted to give the Garcias more money, 
but they could not get the group to agree. "If (the Garcias) were white like 
me, if it was like Larry Hamlin and my brother, it would have been one heck of 
a lot more than they got," he said, adding that he wanted to give each 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson said she was "very surprised" 
by the award. She defended the officers involved, saying they had gone to 
assist in "a domestic violence situation where a woman was in danger." The 
mayor said, "We have a fair police department, they are trained in sensitivity 
to this type of matter and they wouldn't operate like that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the city will decide soon whether to appeal the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg did not return calls Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers sued the city and Officers Thomas Trembley, Steven Overcast and 
Raymond Villescas after the 1988 incident at the Garcias' apartment on Beach 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, a woman identified as Laura Casto, who was 
romantically involved with Roberto Garcia, had moved out of the apartment a few 
days before, leaving behind some clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garcias said they allowed Casto into the apartment on June 16, 1988, to 
retrieve her clothes, but later that day the woman called police to report that 
Roberto Garcia was "a big dope dealer, that he was always armed and that he had 
lots of guns in the apartment," according to lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 6:45 p.m., Casto met the three police officers outside the apartment. 
A police employee telephoned the Garcias and ordered the older brother to step 
outside. When Roberto Garcia went to the front door, he said, he saw the three 
officers pointing pistols at him. He was then handcuffed, searched and roughed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers asked him to call out his brother, Miguel, who was frisked and 
handcuffed. The Garcias said they were placed on the ground, still handcuffed, 
while the officers went inside their home with Laura Casto. The officers then 
searched the apartment and left after removing the brothers' handcuffs.  
</P>
<P>
 No police report was filed and there was no subsequent investigation, 
according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept asking them, 'Why? Why are you doing this to me?' " Roberto Garcia, a 
truck driver, said Thursday. "There is no word to explain the feeling when I 
was down with my face on the ground. I wouldn't treat my dog that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Garcia complained to then-Huntington Beach Police Chief Grover (Bill) 
Payne about the officers' conduct. Payne later wrote the Garcias that an 
internal investigation revealed that "police department regulation was violated 
by one of our employees, (resulting) in the imposition of disciplinary action." 
The letter did not identify who was disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a three-day trial, Judge Moore ruled in favor of a motion by the 
Garcias' attorney, Jerry L. Steering, for a directed verdict -- a seldom-used 
procedure that effectively takes the case away from the jury and leaves it for 
the judge to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement read to the jurors, Moore said the officers unlawfully entered 
the Garcias' apartment and illegally detained them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accordingly, any and all of the force used by the police officers upon the 
plaintiffs was . . . unlawful and unreasonable," said Moore, a retired 
Municipal Court judge on contract with the Superior Court.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore said his verdict "simply means that whether the version of the police 
officers is true, or whether the version of the plaintiff is true, I have 
determined that there was a constitutional violation."  
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated on damages for two days, voting 10-2 on Thursday to give 
Roberto Garcia $43,600, and Miguel Garcia, $61,188. The younger brother 
received more compensatory damage because he said he was recuperating from a 
back injury when police arrested him and pushed him onto the ground, 
aggravating his injury.  
</P>
<P>
 In a civil trial, a majority of jurors must agree on an award, unlike criminal 
cases where the decision must be unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal experts said it was uncommon for a judge to issue a directed 
verdict in such a case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked," said Ronald Talmo, a professor at Western State University 
College of Law's Irvine campus. "This means there was simply no (sound) 
evidence for the defense. (They) had no case whatsoever and didn't recognize 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlin, the jury foreman, and others said that the jury, even the two people 
who voted against awarding any money to the Garcias, was relieved by Moore's 
directed verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the judge's decision was rather helpful," said Beverly Roberge, a 
61-year-old Tustin Ranch resident and one of the two dissenting jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberge said she voted against giving the brothers any money because "as a 
taxpayer, I don't think it was worth any monetary award. The woman who caused 
the entire problem was the one who should have been on trial. The police just 
took her word."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlin, the jury foreman, said he and other jurors felt the incident could 
have been avoided if the officers had simply asked the Garcias to allow Casto 
to retrieve her belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael Emling, who represented the city, described the officers as 
"three fine cops," saying they reacted the way they did because it was a 
"fairly risky situation. When you have the dimension of guns and narcotics (in 
a report), police have a real problem on their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Trembley has since retired with a back injury. Overcast and Villescas are 
still with the department, Emling said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fought the good fight and we lost," Emling said. "It is way too big a jury 
verdict for this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Steering, the Garcias' attorney, said the brothers were never a threat to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom Thursday, the brothers hugged their attorney and told 
him they were happy that the case was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should never have happened," Miguel Garcia said. "I respect everyone. 
Why can't they respect me the same way?"

 As the county's police chiefs rally behind Sheriff Brad Gates at a difficult 
time, a coalition of black civic groups on Thursday demanded more information 
about the death of Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins and called for an independent 
investigation of the Christmas Day shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual action, members of the Orange County Police Chiefs and Sheriffs 
Assn. gave a unanimous vote of confidence to Gates at its regular monthly 
meeting Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a group of organizations from the county's African American 
community requested more details about Robins' death and insisted that the 
state attorney general or the U.S. Department of Justice investigate the 
shooting. The Orange County district attorney's office is now looking into the 
incident, which officials have described as accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned about the appearance of conflict between the district 
attorney and the Sheriff's Department, which have such a close relationship," 
said Eugene Wheeler, president of 100 Black Men of Orange County, an 
organization of professionals and business and civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Orange County chapter of the Urban League issued a similar call 
for state and federal authorities to join in the investigation, and noted that 
Robins, who is black, was shot by a white deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition members who spoke out Thursday represent such organizations as 
the Black Chamber of Commerce, the Baptist Ministers Conference, the National 
Council of Negro Women, the Prince Hall Masons, as well as 100 Black Men. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members also said they were concerned that the deputy who shot 
Robins was the target of a 4-year-old arrest warrant in a traffic case, as 
disclosed last week in The Times. They said they wondered if there was a double 
standard for law enforcement personnel that had been revealed by the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, 30, was mortally wounded in the face by Deputy Brian Scanlan, 32, 
during an impromptu training session behind a Lake Forest shopping center on 
Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, in his first public statement since the shooting, Sheriff Gates 
said that Scanlan apparently violated department policy by using a loaded gun 
during the exercise that led up to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because Gates is working hard to comfort the Robins family and run his 
department in the wake of the shooting, members of the chiefs and sheriffs 
association say they wanted to issue a symbolic gesture of support for his 
efforts on behalf of local law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Robins shooting was a tragic event that could occur to any one of us, and 
Brad Gates has handled it appropriately," said Irvine Police Chief Charles S. 
Brobeck. "I don't think people know how devastating an effect this can have on 
a chief and a department. I know he is going through tremendous personal pain." 
</P>
<P>
 The chiefs and sheriffs association is a professional organization of 
top-ranking law enforcement officers from the county's 25 police agencies. It 
deals with regional police issues and seeks to improve intra-departmental 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 With virtually no discussion, Costa Mesa Police Chief David L. Snowden made 
the motion for a vote of confidence, which was seconded by Huntington Beach 
Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg. A voice vote was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowden described Gates as "an unsung hero" who has been unfairly maligned in 
the media over the Robins shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think about it, Sheriff Gates has been one of the outstanding leaders 
in this county. It seems to me -- and I'm not alone -- that the press is just 
continually bashing him," Snowden said. "You take this incident and the media 
blitz, it's just a little bit more than any human being should be asked to 
endure." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the sheriff's peers in law enforcement," said Assistant Sheriff 
Rocky Hewitt, conveying Gates' appreciation for the show of support. "He is 
still emotionally traumatized from the recent tragedy. He will always feel a 
terrible sense of loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite assurances from law enforcement that the Robins shooting would be 
fully investigated, civic organizations from the county's African American 
community issued a statement Thursday questioning the current inquiry and what 
they have deemed to be "a serious lack of specific details surrounding the 
actual occurrence." 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid any possible conflict of interest, the coalition recommended that the 
shooting be reviewed by a state or federal law enforcement agency that does not 
work closely with the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although they acknowledge Gates' earlier statements about policy violations, 
coalition members say they will ask the Sheriff's Department today to promptly 
disclose to the public more comprehensive information about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Considerable suspicion, Wheeler said, has been generated in the black 
community because information has been slow in coming and initial reports in 
the media indicated that Robins might have shot himself with his own gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming out of the black experience tells us there is something wrong with 
that picture," Wheeler said. "Too many times in our history, we have heard that 
we cut our own throats, tarred and feathered ourselves, or hung ourselves in 
the jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler cautioned that the coalition members were not accusing anyone of 
racism at this time, though he said it is incumbent upon Dist. Atty. Michael R. 
Capizzi and the sheriff to show that race had no part in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the current policy of using the district attorney to 
investigate officer-involved shootings ensures that the probe will be 
independent because it avoids the potential pitfalls that can occur when police 
departments investigate their own officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're an independent agency," said Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maury Evans. 
"We're conducting the investigation, and we will complete our investigation as 
soon as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Dan Martini, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department, said the agency 
would like to release more details about the case to satisfy community 
concerns, but is restricted by county regulations that limit the information 
that can be released in officer-involved shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the frustrating things we have is that there are a lot of things we'd 
like to say but because of the intensity of the investigation and the fact that 
the district attorney is conducting it, we can't. That leaves questions in the 
community, then speculation sets in." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of an effort to provide information about the shooting, the Sheriff's 
Department publicly released this week copies of its department regulations and 
training manuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler said he and others in the coalition also want to make sure that law 
enforcement officers are held to the same standards as the rest of the 
community. He noted that Scanlan had an outstanding warrant for his arrest from 
a traffic violation and questioned why nothing has been done about it for so 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is happening in this situation?" Wheeler asked. "I know if I were 
stopped for something and the officer found out I had a warrant, I would be 
arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the department's code of ethics -- stated in the newly released 
policy manuals -- sheriff's employees must pledge to "keep my private life 
unsullied as an example to all" and to "be exemplary in obeying the laws of the 
land and the regulations of my department." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the traffic warrant, the district attorney's office was in the 
process of collecting a portion of Scanlan's wages because he had failed to pay 
an estimated $10,000 in child support for his two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said the department does not routinely screen employees for arrest 
warrants unless there is reason to believe that there was a warrant that would 
interfere with a deputy's ability to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini acknowledged, however, that employees are required under department 
regulations to report to a supervisor any incident that could result in 
criminal prosecution. Failure to report an arrest warrant could "certainly" 
represent a violation of that section, Martini said. He added that he did not 
know whether Scanlan reported his warrant to a supervisor.

BRADY FORCES GIVE NATIONAL SCOPE TO ROBERTI RECALL BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A seemingly imminent recall election against state Sen. David Roberti began to 
shape up Thursday as a national referendum after gun control champion Sarah 
Brady pledged to throw her organization's support behind the embattled Roberti, 
who has been targeted for ouster by pro-gun activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, whose efforts recently resulted in the enactment of a federal law 
requiring a five-day waiting period for the purchase of handguns, called the 
effort to recall the Van Nuys Democrat an attempt to "martyr" a man of courage 
for his support of gun control legislation, most notably a precedent-setting 
1989 state ban on the sale of military-style semiautomatic assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady is the wife of former President Ronald Reagan's press deputy James 
Brady, who was severely injured in the 1981 assassination attempt against 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Roberti held a news conference Thursday flanked by supporters, 
including Los Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams, Sheriff Sherman Block and 
members of law enforcement organizations, during which he pledged to fight the 
recall "with every ounce of my being." 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference, held outside Reseda High School, where a student was shot 
to death last year, was repeatedly interrupted by hecklers who accused Roberti 
of being a Nazi and an ally of European banking interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm working for European banks?" Roberti said with a grimace, reacting to his 
foes as TV cameras and a host of reporters looked on. "I think that shows the 
wacko degree that some of my opponents have risen to." 
</P>
<P>
 But Steven Glazer, the senator's press secretary, warned that Roberti's gun 
control foes should not be underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Narrow special interests can have an enormous influence" in low-turnout 
special elections like a recall vote, Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A recall election against Roberti is not a certainty, but advocates have filed 
petitions carrying an estimated 45,000 signatures of people who support the 
idea, twice that required. "We are taking this very seriously," Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The signatures must be certified by the Los Angeles County registrar of 
voters. About 10,000 signatures, which must be from voters in Roberti's 20th 
Senate District, have already been deemed valid. An election might be held as 
early as April. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti advisers welcomed the idea that the recall could spark a national 
debate on the subject of gun control and called it inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there's such a serious attack on the author of the nation's first law 
against assault weapons, it will naturally create a national referendum," 
Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Cooney, western regional director of Handgun Control Inc., the group 
founded by Brady, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Roberti will have our full support," said Cooney, speaking at the 
Roberti news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Although recall proponents have said Roberti should be ousted for a number of 
reasons, Roberti accused his foes of harboring a single motive: to drive a gun 
control advocate from office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an Uzi," Roberti said, holding up a semiautomatic weapon. "That's 
what this is all about!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Uzi is one of more than a dozen assault rifles banned by the 1989 law he 
authored in the wake of a widely publicized schoolyard shooting in Stockton. A 
man wielding an assault rifle killed five children and injured 30 people. 
</P>
<P>
 With the enactment of that law, Roberti said, "we lit a small candle for 
peace." The embattled lawmaker also pledged to press forward with new 
legislation to ban the sale of large ammunition clips in California. 
</P>
<P>
 If the gun lobby's recall campaign is defeated, Roberti added, it will 
hopefully embolden the federal government and lawmakers in other states to 
enact tougher measures to control guns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Applauding Roberti were Block and Williams; Fred Tredy, a director of the Los 
Angeles Police Protective League, and Frank Grimes, head of the Southern 
California Assn. of Law Enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Motioned to a table laden with three assault weapons, Williams pledged his 
"100% support for any program that will help remove weapons like these from the 
streets. There's no use for these weapons but to hurt other human beings." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, recall activists held a news conference outside the modest 
Van Nuys bungalow that Roberti claims as his official residence, although he 
admits that he lives outside the 20th District in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 At the event, Bill Dominguez, a Van Nuys systems analyst and chairman of the 
Coalition to Restore Government Integrity, a group seeking Roberti's ouster, 
called Roberti a "political dinosaur" who deserved extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition includes anti-gun control groups, such as the American Pistol 
and Rifle Assn. and the Gun Owners Action Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores White, a Republican who ran against Roberti in 1992, when he assumed 
the state Senate seat vacated by Alan Robbins, said Roberti deserved to be 
recalled not only because of his position on gun control but because he opposes 
term limits for state legislators, campaign finance reform and tougher laws 
against criminals, and permitted corruption to flourish in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 White said she would run on the recall ballot to replace Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the speakers also warned that other state lawmakers -- including 
Assemblymen Terry B. Friedman, D-Brentwood, and Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles 
-- are in danger of being recalled due to their support of gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's defeat, predicted Chairman Manuel Fernandez of the Constitutional 
Rights Federation, will serve as an example of what happens to lawmakers who 
"disarm the good citizens" as a substitute for enacting tougher anti-crime 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitutional Rights Federation represents gun owners in the San Fernando 
Valley.

GROUP FORMS TO FIGHT 'IMMIGRANT-BASHING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do you do when so many people are saying bad things about illegal 
immigrants? 
</P>
<P>
 You form a new group with a catchy name, and then you do the American thing: 
get yourself a political PR agency. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what Proponents for Responsible Immigration Debate and 
Education did. But the new pro-immigrant coalition didn't hire just anybody. It 
hired a firm that has worked for Jimmy Carter, Jesse Jackson and even Boris 
Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 It is part of the strategy of PRIDE, established by Latino organizations and 
politicians to fight "immigrant-bashing" and to attempt to raise the level and 
tone of the immigration debate in the upcoming political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will be watching out for campaign mailers such as one sent out in 
1992 that carried the headline "Invasion U.S.A." and showed illegal immigrants 
dashing across the border.  
</P>
<P>
 The group plans to launch its counteroffensive today with a private meeting 
with Gov. Pete Wilson in Sacramento. Latino officials have criticized Wilson 
for blaming the state's fiscal problems on unchecked immigration and proposing 
that citizenship be denied to illegal immigrants' U.S.-born children. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are to believe the rhetoric, we would believe that immigrants were 
responsible for the shrinking aerospace industry, the rising cost of living and 
the mass corporate exodus out of California," said Assemblyman Richard Polanco 
(D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Legislature's Latino Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina, who will attend today's meeting with Wilson, said 
the group will "insist that he return the immigration debate and discussion 
back to one that is reasonable and sensible." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is "more than willing to sit down with anyone who wishes to calmly and 
rationally discuss an issue that is of great importance to the state," Beth 
Miller, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has maintained that illegal immigrants cost the state $3 billion a year 
that could be spent on services for legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 PRIDE is expected to become the chief adversary of another group with an 
equally catchy name -- FAIR. Federation for American Immigration Reform has 
advocated limiting legal immigration and cutting off public services to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the well-funded federation, the coalition is largely a volunteer 
effort, run from the offices of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has brought together virtually all of the big-name Latino elected 
officials in Los Angeles County, including longtime political rivals Molina and 
City Councilman Richard Alatorre. It hopes to also include Latino politicians 
from other parts of the state and members of other groups, including Asian 
American, Jewish and women's organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Vargas, MALDEF vice president, said pro-immigrant groups have allowed 
anti-immigration forces to frame the debate so far and that the coalition 
intends to change that by being more proactive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The group's mission won't be easy to accomplish. It is up against public 
opinion polls that show negative attitudes toward illegal immigrants, even 
among some immigrants. But the coalition believes some of those attitudes are 
based on erroneous information. 
</P>
<P>
 As a first step, the group has hired Goddard-Claussen/First Tuesday, a 
Malibu-based political consulting firm that worked on the presidential 
campaigns of Carter and Jackson. Last year, the agency created TV spots to 
promote Russian President Yeltsin's democratic-style reforms to voters there. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members say they hope to promote the positive side of legal and 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is unlikely to run costly radio ads as anti-immigration groups have 
done. Instead the coalition plans to build strength among a variety of ethnic 
groups and encourage newspapers, radio and television to cover both sides of 
the immigration debate. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the politicians in the coalition are Democrats but insist they will not 
spare fellow Democrats from criticism. Some of the Latino leaders have pledged 
to withhold endorsements from politicians who they consider immigrant bashers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new group also plans to lead a campaign to defeat proposed state 
initiatives that would deny illegal immigrants and their children access to 
public hospitals and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition also plans to aggressively respond to charges that immigrants 
are a drain on the economy. Working with the group is Harry Pachon, president 
of the Tomas Rivera Center, a Latino research institution, who contends that 
most studies overestimate the number of illegal immigrants, exaggerate the 
public services they consume and underestimate the taxes they pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The new group said its efforts will follow four principles:  
</P>
<P>
 * The best way to reduce illegal immigration is "raise the standard of living 
and improve life opportunities in the sender countries. This requires greater 
emphasis on economic development, the fostering of democratic movements and 
foreign assistance to the countries that are the primary sources of migration." 
</P>
<P>
 * The right of citizenship must not be compromised and promoting citizenship 
among immigrants "must become a national priority."  
</P>
<P>
 * "Human dignity and respect are cornerstones of the American tradition, and 
all immigrants, including the undocumented, have basic human and civil rights," 
including access to public hospitals and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * "As a sovereign nation, the United States is entitled to control and 
regulate its borders. . . . Border control must be civilian, and guided by the 
values of efficiency, safety, dignity and humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is critical that Californians understand that people do not come to this 
country to enroll their children in school," said Assemblywoman Martha Escutia 
(D-Huntington Park). "They come here to work, and as long as there is a demand 
for poorly paid cooks, gardeners and nannies, they will continue to come." 
</P>
<P>
 "This organization is not here to promote undocumented immigration," Rep. 
Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) said. "It is here to promote a balanced debate 
on immigration . . . to lead to some solutions to immigration.

BY INVITATION ONLY, STARS COME OUT AT LAZAR SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE and SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 He was a compact man, just over 5 feet, 2 inches in his custom-made Sulka 
socks. But super-agent Irving Paul (Swifty) Lazar had always lived large, and 
his invitation-only memorial service Thursday was crowded with giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sinatra rubbed elbows with Gene Kelly. Angie Dickinson hugged Anjelica 
Huston. Larry McMurtry, author of "Lonesome Dove," sat just a stone's throw 
from Jackie Collins, author of "The Stud." The stars of the movie "Grumpy Old 
Men" -- Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon -- were there, along with another famous 
grump: Don Rickles. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 people crowded into the small chapel at Westwood Memorial Park 
to reminisce about the inimitable Lazar, Hollywood's best-known literary and 
talent agent, who died last week at the age of 86. During the hourlong service, 
friends swapped favorite stories about Lazar's fearlessness, his tenacity, his 
distaste for dirt. But according to one person who was there, the speakers 
returned again and again to one central theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody can get God to sign a book deal," the guest said, "it would be 
Irving." 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar, who at one time or another represented everyone from Richard Nixon to 
Vladimir Nabokov, was remembered Thursday as the last of a dynamic, 
larger-than-life breed. Humphrey Bogart had dubbed him Swifty after Lazar made 
five deals for the movie star in one day. But most of his friends thought of 
him as Irving, the unstoppable, gracious and impeccable host whose exclusive 
Oscar-night party was always the hottest ticket in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar had made his living by knowing precisely what -- and whom -- he liked. 
He was meticulous about his style, from the cut of his trousers to the lilt of 
his Brooklyn-born voice. So perhaps it was inevitable that the afternoon 
service in Lazar's honor would be organized by none other than Lazar himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his death, Lazar had made up the guest list -- "not a 'Who's Who' list, 
but just his closest friends," said one friend. He had specified which flowers 
should be arranged (Casablanca lilies and tuberoses -- a fragrant favorite of 
Lazar's late wife, Mary). He had arranged for a reception after the service, to 
be held at Spago, the high-brow restaurant where he had thrown his star-studded 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Lazar had decreed that the media would be kept out. He had lived 
loud, cutting an unforgettable swath in his black-rimmed Mr. Magoo glasses and 
shiny pate. But Lazar apparently wanted a quiet exit. In accordance with "Mr. 
Lazar's instructions," said one of his secretaries, no reporters were welcome 
(except, of course, those who had become friends). 
</P>
<P>
 From the roof of a parking structure overlooking the oasis-like cemetery, 
reporters and photographers who hadn't been part of Lazar's inner circle glared 
down at a few journalists who evidently had. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's Dominick Dunne!" one of the paparazzi called out when he spotted the 
Vanity Fair writer heading into the chapel. A few minutes later, Daily Variety 
columnist Army Archerd and George Christy of the Hollywood Reporter stepped out 
of their cars and into the throng. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a throng it was. Invitations had been extended by telephone to a 
select but varied group. There were producers: George Schlatter of "Laugh-In," 
Fred de Cordova of "The Tonight Show" and Leonard Goldberg of 20th Century Fox. 
There were lawyers (Sidney Korshak), managers (Freddie de Mann, who represents 
Madonna) and moguls (financier Marvin Davis). Bette Midler was there, as were 
Maria Shriver, Henry Mancini and Bob Newhart. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmet Ertegun, the founder of Atlantic Records, was one of the people who 
spoke. He recalled once being in a small plane with Lazar when one of the 
engines went out. The pilot said they would have to turn around, but Lazar 
reportedly said, "Oh no, my boy, we have to get to Greece." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Hart, the son of playwright Moss Hart, recalled that when he was a 
child, Lazar's fastidiousness fascinated him. One guest recalled Hart's story 
this way: "Every time Mr. Lazar came to visit, he would see this brigade of 
towels parading to the guest house. The young boy said to his father, 'Dad, why 
all the towels?' and Moss Hart, being very proper and not wanting to demean 
Lazar, thought and thought and finally said, 'Well, son, he likes to be very 
dry."' 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Douglas and Gregory Peck reportedly had been invited (although the 
closest the rooftop gallery got to spotting either was a glimpse of Peck's wife 
and daughter).

 A seemingly imminent recall election against state Sen. David A. Roberti began 
to shape up Thursday as a national battle over gun control after Sarah Brady 
pledged to throw the support of her organization behind the embattled Roberti, 
who has been targeted for ouster by pro-gun activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, whose efforts recently resulted in enactment of a federal five-day 
waiting period for the purchase of handguns, called the campaign to recall 
Roberti, a Van Nuys Democrat, an attempt to martyr a man of courage for his 
support of gun control legislation, most notably a precedent-setting 1989 state 
ban on the sale of military-style semiautomatic assault rifles. Brady is the 
wife of President Ronald Reagan's press deputy, James Brady, who was severely 
injured in the 1981 assassination attempt on Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Roberti held a news conference Thursday flanked by supporters, 
including LAPD Chief Willie L. Williams, Sheriff Sherman Block and law 
enforcement organizations, where he pledged to fight the recall "with every 
ounce of my being." 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference, held outside Reseda High School, where a student was shot 
and killed last year, was repeatedly interrupted by hecklers who accused 
Roberti of being a Nazi and an ally of European banking interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "European banks?" grimaced Roberti, responding to his foes as TV cameras and 
reporters looked on. "That shows the wacko nature of this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Steven Glazer, Roberti's press secretary, warned that the gun control foes 
should not be underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Narrow special interests can have an enormous influence" in low-turnout 
special elections, Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recall election against Roberti is not a sure thing, but advocates have 
filed petitions with about 45,000 signatures supporting it, twice the number 
required. "We are taking this very seriously," Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The signatures have to be certified by the Los Angeles County registrar of 
voters. Already, 10,000 have been deemed valid. Signatures must be of voters 
from Roberti's 20th Senate District. An election might be held as early as 
April or May. 
</P>
<P>
 If the recall campaign can be defeated, it may embolden federal lawmakers and 
legislators in other states to enact tougher gun control measures, Roberti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applauding Roberti were Block and Williams, Fred Tredy, a director of the Los 
Angeles Police Protective League, and Frank Grimes, head of the Southern 
California Assn. of Law Enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, recall activists held a news conference outside the bungalow 
in Van Nuys that Roberti claims as his official residence, although he admits 
he lives outside the 20th District in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 At the event, recall leader Bill Dominguez termed Roberti a "political 
dinosaur" who deserves extinction. Dominguez is a Van Nuys systems analyst who 
is chairman of the Coalition to Restore Government Integrity, a coalition of 
groups seeking Roberti's ouster.

NO HOME FOR HOPPY; HOPALONG CASSIDY IS A GOOD GUY DOWN ON HIS LUCK -- WHEN A 
DOWNEY ANTIQUE STORE FOLDS, SO WILL ITS MUSEUM OF THE COWBOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gene Autry has his vast museum in Griffith Park. Roy Rogers' famed horse, 
Trigger, is stuffed and mounted at his museum in Victorville. Will Rogers has a 
whole state park in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Hopalong Cassidy, the classic good guy among the celluloid 
cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a corner of an antique store in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 It's there that No. 1 fans Bob and Linda Szabat in 1991 established the 
Hopalong Cassidy Museum with a collection of 1,500 items, including Hopalong 
Cassidy lunch boxes, comic books, movie stills, signed photographs and an 
original script for the 1937 film "Hills of Old Wyoming." 
</P>
<P>
 They may not have the real silver handguns used in his films, but there are a 
couple of replicas in a display case. For fans of old Hoppy, portrayed by the 
late William Boyd in 66 films from 1935 to 1948 and later on television, it's 
all spread out in the living room-size area, free for the gazing -- at least 
through the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it will close. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple dedicated to preserving the memory of their film hero have lost a 2 
1/2-year shootout with the local economy. They will hang up their guns Jan. 28 
because the store is going bankrupt. "We have traffic, but people just aren't 
buying," said Bob Szabat, 48. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the museum as a tribute to a boyhood idol, a silver-haired paragon 
of Western virtue who never smoked, drank, swore or made love. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always doing for the guy who couldn't do for himself, helping the 
underdog," Szabat said. A loner growing up, he identified with the 
self-reliance and unwavering individuality of Boyd's character. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a saloon, he would order milk or sarsaparilla," the antique dealer said. 
"Now people might have looked at him funny, but it taught kids not to worry 
about what people think. It was teaching a way out of peer pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 The Downey exhibit is not the only tribute to Hopalong Cassidy in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one in Boyd's hometown of Cambridge, Ohio, as well. And the 
University of Wyoming has the only remaining artifacts directly connected to 
Boyd: a few articles of clothing, a saddle and the two pistols used in his 
films. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortage of such items was one of the problems in creating a Hopalong 
Cassidy museum, no matter how small. Because of the low budgets of Boyd's 
pictures, he would wear the same clothes until they wore out, Szabat said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rarest item in his museum is one of five pony saddles bearing Hopalong's 
name and likeness that Boyd presented to the winners of a comic book contest in 
the late 1940s. The saddle was a surprise gift to Bob Szabat from his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's made Christmases nice," Linda Szabat said. "I've always tried to find 
something to give him for the museum." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Szabat began collecting Hoppy items in the late 1970s, starting with a few 
comic books, buttons and a couple of movie posters. 
</P>
<P>
 He later began collecting videotapes of Hoppy's movies. So visitors to the 
museum can see Hoppy -- along with his classic sidekick, the white-whiskered 
Gabby Hayes -- chasing the bad guys on a small television screen in a corner of 
the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes died in 1969, Boyd in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 6,000 people have signed the registration books of the museum at 
8618 Firestone Blvd., and Szabat estimates that about 10,000 have seen the 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the closest we came to myths," one visitor, Gregory F. Nighswonger, 
42, of Bellflower, said during a recent visit. "There was a sense of right and 
wrong that was clear to young kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Nighswonger said he has been a fan of Westerns since he was a boy. "I remember 
having a lot of this stuff," he said of the Hoppy paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Szabat said he has had visitors from as far as New York, Florida, Washington 
and Pennsylvania. "I like to watch people's faces as they come through here," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit room takes up just 225 square feet near the rear entrance of the 
Szabats' sprawling store that sells a mix of antiques, old posters and records, 
and used furniture. They blame the economy, and the closing of nearby military 
facilities, for its demise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Szabats are not sure what they will do with their Hoppy collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Since announcing that they will close the museum, they have received several 
requests to house the collection in restaurants, and are considering lending 
the items to the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles. But only 
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Szabat is intent on reopening his own museum someday, somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know I want to be near it," he said of the collection. "I come in here 
every day to check things. I've seen it probably 5,000 times and I still enjoy 
it."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH GATE; 3 YOUNG 
WOMEN SHOT WHILE WALKING HOME FROM PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gunman wounded three South Gate teen-age women Thursday as they tried to 
find their way home from a party in San Gabriel by walking along the San 
Bernardino Freeway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Romero, 18; Diane Enriquez, 19, and Gabriella Bengoa, 18, drove to 
the party about 8 p.m. Wednesday with several members of South Gate's Grape 
Street gang, according to San Gabriel Police Lt. Jim Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
 After one of the men made unwanted advances toward one woman, the three women 
left the party about 2:45 a.m. and walked onto Interstate 10, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men followed on foot, words were exchanged, and one man drew a 
small-caliber pistol, firing five to six rounds, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero was shot in the head and was in critical condition at County-USC 
Medical Center. Enriquez was wounded in the shoulder and hand and was in stable 
condition. Bengoa was struck in the shoulder and treated and released at San 
Gabriel Valley Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests had been made, police said Thursday.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BRAUDE 
CALLS FOR CHANGES IN LOBBYISTS' FEE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude has proposed a law that would ban 
lobbyists from linking their fees to the size of contracts their clients win at 
City Hall. He said such a prohibition would be modeled on a state ethics law 
that is designed to prevent lobbyists from becoming too personally entangled in 
the companies or issues they advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal stems from a Times story about a businesswoman who said she 
objected when a city official suggested that she needed a lobbyist to win a 
city contract. The businesswoman said that two lobbyists offered to take her 
case if they got a share of the contract, fees that would have totaled more 
than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The company involved in the dispute, Plastopan, submitted the low bid to 
supply plastic trash cans to the city and planned to build a local 
manufacturing plant. The company resisted hiring a lobbyist and its bid was 
disqualified for procedural oversights spotted by a rival's lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 The original bids for the garbage can contract were later thrown out because 
of disputes that arose. New bids were recently accepted and Plastopan is still 
in the running for the contract.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CARSON; EX-MAYOR, 3 
OTHERS INDICTED IN $2-MILLION FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former mayor of Carson and three others were indicted Thursday for an 
alleged scheme to bilk the state out of more than $2 million in workers' 
compensation funds, federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41-count grand jury indictment adds new charges to a case filed against 
the defendants and others in 1991, scheduled for trial in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Named in the new complaint are ex-Carson Mayor John L. Junk, 57; Robert J. 
Anderson, 50, of Alameda and Peoria, Ariz.; Howard J. Laird, 61, and Alyce L. 
Laird, 32. Junk was mayor of Carson in 1969 and 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Howard Laird is a fugitive, but that they expect the other 
three to face arraignment on the new indictment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Jennifer Lum said the defendants used firms in Downey, 
Covina, West Covina and Paramount to set up workers' compensation insurance for 
California businesses -- but paid only about a third of the funds received from 
the businesses to insurance companies and allegedly pocketed $2.7 million. The 
charges arose from an investigation by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and 
the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service, Lum said. 
</P>
<P>
 All four defendants face charges of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail 
fraud. The Lairds both face tax charges.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LAKEWOOD; ALLEGED 
FOUNDER OF SPUR POSSE SENTENCED IN BURGLARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man alleged to be a founder of the infamous Spur Posse at Lakewood High 
School was sentenced Thursday to 10 years in prison for burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Belman, 20, of Lakewood, was convicted late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Belman and his friends, most of them students at Lakewood High, touched off a 
national furor last spring when stories surfaced of their sexual escapades, 
including alleged harassment of female students and keeping score of sexual 
encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the 17 sex-related Spur Posse cases presented to the district 
attorney's office, 15 were rejected. One teen-ager pleaded guilty and has been 
sent to a juvenile camp, and another faces one felony charge.  
</P>
<P>
 The charges leading to Belman's conviction surfaced in the wake of the sexual 
allegations. Authorities said Belman, after being invited to the home of some 
junior high school girls in June, 1992, entered the girls' parents' bedroom and 
took credit cards, which he used.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH-CENTRAL; 
RESIDENTS VOICE OPPOSITION TO REBUILDING LIQUOR STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of South-Central Los Angeles residents told a city commission Thursday 
that although they want officials to encourage businesses to rebuild in 
riot-torn neighborhoods, they do not want any more liquor stores or swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Their comments came as the Planning Commission considered changes to an 
ordinance that allows businesses that were damaged or destroyed in the 1992 
riots to rebuild with fewer bureaucratic hurdles.The changes considered 
Thursday included reducing the required number of parking spaces and extending 
the ordinance an additional year until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and 
Treatment said they want to make sure the new provisions will not make it 
easier for liquor stores to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 But Min Paek, executive director of the Korean-American Grocers Victims Assn., 
argued that the same rules should apply to all businesses. She said that only 
six of her 200-member group have been able to rebuild.  
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners delayed a decision for two weeks.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TESTIMONY 
ABOUT KILLINGS READ TO MENENDEZ JURORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Testimony from both Menendez brothers about the Aug. 20, 1989, shootings of 
their parents -- and the events immediately before -- was read back to Erik 
Menendez's jury Thursday as deliberations continued in the murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lyle and Erik Menendez testified that they ran to their rooms, grabbed 
their 12-gauge pump shotguns, raced outside, loaded the guns, then dashed back 
into the Beverly Hills mansion -- where they blasted away at their parents, 
Jose and Kitty Menendez, in the TV room. 
</P>
<P>
 A court stenographer also read back another snippet of testimony for the Erik 
Menendez jury, in its 14th day of deliberations -- Lyle Menendez's account of a 
screaming match that he said his younger brother had with their mother three 
nights before the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lyle Menendez jury put in a full day behind closed doors, its 16th day of 
deliberations. Two juries are deciding the case because some evidence was 
admissible against only one brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 25, and Erik Menendez, 23, are charged with murder. The 
brothers testified that they killed in fear fed by years of abuse. Prosecutors 
contend that the brothers killed out of hatred and greed.

MAN'S PLEA FOR ASYLUM TO BE RECONSIDERED; REFUGEES: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ENDS 
HUNGER STRIKE AFTER DEPORTATION ORDER IS STAYED. DRAFT-EVADER SAYS HE FLED 
SERBIA TO AVOID MILITARY SERVICE THAT COULD HAVE ENTAILED ACTION AGAINST FELLOW 
MUSLIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S. immigration judge has stayed a deportation order and agreed to 
reconsider granting political asylum to a 24-year-old Muslim illegal immigrant 
from Serbia who has been held in the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
detention facility in San Pedro for nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Judge Lauren R. Mathon prompted the immigrant to cease a 
hunger strike of several days and express hope that he will be paroled from 
jail while legal deliberations in his case continue. He asked that only his 
first name, Redjep, be used publicly, in order to protect members of his family 
in Serbia from possible government reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathon's ruling was hailed by Salam Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public 
Affairs Council in Los Angeles, as "helping establish (the) responsibility of 
the Free World to shelter victims of ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 The council has championed the immigrant's cause with demonstrations, 
petitions and the retention of an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Redjep is from the heavily Muslim Sandzak province in Serbia. He said he fled 
to avoid military service that could have entailed action against fellow 
Muslims. He made his way across Turkey, Russia and the Pacific on a forged 
Canadian visa, only to be taken by a Russian freighter on to Southern 
California when the Canadians rejected him. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his case was publicized last month, two State Department advisories to 
Mathon were disclosed, suggesting that some compromise might be found between 
granting Redjep asylum and deporting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "An applicant (for asylum) who is a draft-evader or deserter may be considered 
a refugee, provided it can be shown that he would suffer disproportionately 
severe punishment for his evasion or desertion on account of his race, 
religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political 
opinion," wrote Roger Dankert, director of the State Department's Office of 
Asylum Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dankert added, in his second advisory: "The judge might wish to consider, 
given the increasingly unsettled conditions in the applicant's region of his 
country of origin, such administrative remedies as may be available." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mathon gave no reason in writing for ordering reconsideration of the 
case, her decision reversed her ruling last summer in which she rejected asylum 
and ordered deportation as soon as practical. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the chief INS spokesman, Duke Austin, said there are several 
common alternatives to granting asylum to or deporting such an individual. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most frequently used is to grant parole to the individual, 
releasing him to live freely until his case is reconsidered, Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that in such cases the release can last a long time, and in some 
instances the case is never reconsidered. "Some stay in the parole status for 
four or five years without further proceedings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other alternatives are a formal suspension of the individual's case, or, if 
deportation is still considered advisable, a search for a third country to 
deport the immigrant to, a place where the individual would not be subject to 
persecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asylum is never a pure science," Austin said.  
</P>
<P>
 The INS spokesman added that State Department advisories are not particularly 
popular with the INS. "It's like telling us what we can do, when we are already 
aware what we can do," Austin said. "We realize we have discretion." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathon said she cannot comment further on the case.

POLICE SEEK FURTHER LINKS IN 5 SLAYINGS IN SAN GABRIEL VALLEY; CRIME: OFFICIALS 
GIVE FEW DETAILS IN WOMEN'S DEATHS, BUT SAY ALL THE CASES MAY BE CONNECTED. THE 
BODIES WERE FOUND IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS.

<P>
 When the bodies of four women were found in the East San Gabriel Valley and 
nearby Chino last fall, authorities said the killings did not appear to be 
linked. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were all black and in their 30s, they had been strangled and their 
bodies had been thrown in business parks or by roadsides. But investigators 
said the similarities were happenstance and not the work of a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
 They said that the bodies of eight slain women had been found dumped in Los 
Angeles in November alone. The San Gabriel Valley murders were just part of an 
abnormally high monthly tally of dumped bodies, officials reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the body of a fifth woman was found in the San Gabriel Valley on 
Dec. 30, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Pomona Police 
Department this week said three of the deaths are considered linked. And, 
investigators said, they are looking into the possibility that the deaths of 
the two other victims also may be connected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been trying to confirm information all along, but it wasn't until 
Wednesday that we met (with sheriff's detectives) and established a definite 
link," said Pomona Police Lt. Leon Sakamoto. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, investigators, who have been closed-mouthed about the deaths, refused 
to divulge evidence linking the victims and were reluctant to label the 
homicides the work of a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members of the victims said investigators have not kept them informed 
about the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want clues, I don't want the bloody details," said Rea Sayers of 
Omaha, mother of the most recent victim, Cheryl Sayers. She said sheriff's and 
Pomona authorities did not even telephone her with the news that her daughter 
had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Sayers, 36, whose body was found in Ganesha Park in Pomona at 6 
a.m. Dec. 30, is linked to those of Helen Hill, 36, of Covina, and Donna 
Goldsmith, 35, of Montclair, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was found at 10 a.m. Nov. 14 in the parking lot of a business park in 
City of Industry. Goldsmith's body was found at 5:15 a.m. Nov. 17, next to a 
trash bin in a Pomona business park. 
</P>
<P>
 All three women were prostitutes, police said. None owned cars. 
</P>
<P>
 All three also had similar histories. They dropped out of school at early 
ages, became unmarried mothers and had spotty work backgrounds and minor 
criminal records, according to family members and court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill and Goldsmith were close friends, family members said. In the days before 
her death, Goldsmith lived in a succession of motels and rented rooms. Hill had 
planned to help Goldsmith by letting her move in with her, said Goldsmith's 
daughter, Toni, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hill was killed Nov. 14 after a night of partying at the Elks Lodge in 
Pomona, said her sister, Alice Hill. Helen Hill was picked up outside the lodge 
by two men driving a yellow Oldsmobile. She told her male companion she would 
be right back but she never returned, Alice Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith was killed three days later after she paid an evening visit to her 
daughter's house in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sayers, who had a record of arrests for prostitution in Omaha, had come to 
California to get her life together, said Rea Sayers. She was staying with a 
relative in Ontario, but Sayers said she has received no information on how her 
daughter ended up dead in a Pomona park. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona police and sheriff's detectives would not comment on the relationship 
among the victims. But one law enforcement source said that it is not unusual 
for prostitutes to know each other, even within the large geographical area 
encompassed by Los Angeles County. And the three linked victims all lived in 
the Pomona area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a circuit they work. They have no cars. They do cross paths, either 
in the street or in jail," said the investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two cases being investigated for possible links are those of Betty 
Harris, 37, of Pomona, found dead Nov. 1 in a business park in Diamond Bar, and 
Roxanne Bates, 31, of Pomona, found Nov. 5 on a rural road in Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates and Harris had similar lifestyles and minor criminal histories. Harris' 
family said they doubted that she was a prostitute, but Bates was convicted 
four times of prostitution in Los Angeles County in 1991 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Hill said her sister, Helen, may have known both women. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister knew a whole lot of people," Hill said. "I'm almost sure she knew . 
. . Roxanne and Betty."

WOMAN SHOOTS SELF AT WORKERS' COMP COURT; SAFETY: NO ONE ELSE IS HURT, BUT 
SANTA MONICA INCIDENT PROMPTS CALLS FOR TIGHTER SECURITY AT SITES OF HEARINGS 
ON DISABILITY AND UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A woman apparently distraught over her disability case shot herself in the 
head Thursday during a meeting with a workers' compensation judge in Santa 
Monica, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, identified as 37-year-old Jhoy Geronimo of Hawthorne, was reported 
in good condition Thursday at Saint Johns Hospital in Santa Monica. No one else 
was hurt in the midmorning incident at the Workers' Compensation Appeal Board 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting prompted calls for tighter security at public places such as the 
workers' compensation court, which, according to Presiding Judge Franklin Kaye, 
has no regular guards and is only occasionally patrolled by state police. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing is recurring and one of these days somebody's going to kill one or 
more of the judges or the secretaries or God knows who else," said Chris 
Voight, spokesman for the Assn. of California State Attorneys and 
Administrative Law Judges, whose members include the state's 130 workers' 
compensation judges and other hearing officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica incident came only a month after an out-of-work computer 
engineer killed three people during a shooting rampage in an Oxnard 
unemployment office. After the Oxnard shootings, state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles) announced that he would draft legislation aimed at improving security 
in public buildings statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a workers' compensation judge in Los Angeles disarmed a man who held 
a gun to the head of an insurance company lawyer before his hearing was to 
start. The .22-caliber pistol turned out not to be loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Geronimo, representing herself in a 2-year-old psychiatric 
disability claim against a medical rehabilitation company, pulled a .22-caliber 
handgun from her pocket during a conference in the office of state workers' 
compensation Judge William Ordas. 
</P>
<P>
 "She pulled a handkerchief from her pocket and put it to her head. The next 
thing everybody heard was a gunshot," said Santa Monica Police Sgt. Gary 
Gallinot. He said the single bullet Geronimo fired did not appear to have 
penetrated her skull. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha J. Shaw, an attorney for the insurance company resisting Geronimo's 
claim, brought a bodyguard to the conference because of past threats by the 
Hawthorne woman, according to a spokesman for the law firm, Tobin Lucks & 
Goldman of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye said officials are now considering increasing security at the workers' 
compensation court. State police are called to the building an average of once 
every two weeks for cases in which officials fear an appellant may become 
violent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The court -- with 10 judges and about 50 other employees -- consists of 10 
courtrooms and offices rented in an office building near Santa Monica Municipal 
Airport. About 300 people pass through the office each day, Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges' association is calling for metal detectors and armed guards at all 
court and hearing locations, many of which have unsecured entrances, Voight 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The association is most worried about the potential for violence at workers' 
compensation and unemployment offices because appellants can become angry or 
desperate after being out of work for months while cases are handled, he said.

ANAHEIM SAYS LEASE 'INTACT' UNTIL IT GETS FORMAL NOTICE, $2 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth released the following statement Thursday 
after receiving a future termination of lease notice from Rams Executive Vice 
President John Shaw: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have received notification this morning, shortly before 10 a.m., that the 
Rams intend to exercise their termination of lease option on May 3, 1994, as 
stated in Paragraph 29 of our lease agreement with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement states that a 15-month notice to vacate must be accompanied with 
a $2-million payment for such an option to be effective.Until the city receives 
that notice and payment, our lease with the Rams remains complete and intact. 
</P>
<P>
 As we have already stated, we intend to do what we can in order to keep the 
Rams in Anaheim, but all parties must understand that we are financially 
limited as to what we can offer them. We have been good business partners with 
the Rams in the past, and believe Orange County has done a good job of 
supporting the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Because this formal notification won't take place until May 3, we now have a 
window of opportunity in which to reach some kind of arrangement with the Rams 
that would keep them in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the contents of the letter we have received, our next step will be to 
sit down with the Rams and discuss options and needs which could be the basis 
for a possible resolution of this situation.

BALTIMORE MOVE MIGHT BE HARD TO BRING ABOUT; RAMS: WASHINGTON REDSKINS' PLANNED 
SHIFT TO LAUREL, MD., COULD MAKE MEMPHIS OR ST. LOUIS EASIER OPTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One reason the Rams are considering leaving Anaheim is team executives don't 
believe the Los Angeles area can support two professional football teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But can Maryland? 
</P>
<P>
 This could be a key question if a Rams-to-Baltimore move is discussed over the 
next few months, and the likely answer from the NFL would be: 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-ranking NFL official recently told The Times that the Rams "wouldn't 
have any problems" leaving Anaheim, but if their destination is Baltimore, as 
has been widely speculated, they could face a giant hurdle in the form of 
Washington Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke recently announced plans to move the Redskins out of RFK Stadium and 
into a new, 78,600-seat, 300-luxury-suite stadium in Laurel, Md., 20 miles 
northeast of Washington, D.C. -- and only 20 miles south of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Cooke has threatened to move the team. Since 1988, 
he has announced plans for two stadium projects, one in the Washington suburb 
of Alexandria, Va., and the other near Dulles International Airport in Northern 
Virginia, about 30 miles west of the city. Both plans fell through. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Laurel project, which would turn the Laurel Race Track into a complex 
similar to the Meadowlands in New Jersey, seems to be gaining momentum. An 
environmental impact report has been completed, and legislators in the Maryland 
suburbs have embraced the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke has set up an office in Laurel to lease luxury suites in the proposed 
stadium, and he also has begun purchasing land at the Laurel site -- a step he 
never reached in the two previous projects. He hopes to break ground this 
summer and begin play there in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke also said he made "positive" progress at a Monday meeting with Maryland 
Gov. William Donald Schaefer, who has adamantly opposed Cooke's plan for fear 
it would dash his hopes for bringing a team to Baltimore, which recently lost 
out to Charlotte and Jacksonville in the bid for NFL expansion teams. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL franchises are not subject to territorial rights, but proximity to another 
team is one of the factors the league considers in evaluating transfers. The 
Rams would likely have a much more difficult time moving to Baltimore if the 
Redskins moved to Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
 But Herb Belgrad, chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority, is convinced 
Maryland could support two NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Redskins have 48,000 on their season-ticket waiting list, and we sold out 
108 skyboxes (in a proposed new stadium) in six weeks," said Belgrad, whose 
group has been exploring options of bringing a pro football team to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Redskins have always had a Southern Maryland and Virginia market, and our 
market is distinct and separate. Even when the Colts left here (in 1984), the 
Redskins didn't see a change in the composition of their fans. So I don't see 
(a Redskin move to Laurel) as a deterrent." 
</P>
<P>
 Two NFL owners who were reached Thursday, Pat Bowlen of the Denver Broncos and 
Dan Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers, declined to speculate on a possible Ram 
departure or whether the league would approve two teams in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us have much information on it, so we're all a little in the dark," 
Bowlen said. "I haven't seen anything solid that would represent that (the 
Redskins or Rams are going to move). But it's quite evident Baltimore wants a 
team and is prepared to go to any extent to get one. That's all I know for 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore will begin construction of a $165-million, 72,000-seat stadium, 
including 108 skyboxes, in the Camden Yards area as soon as it secures a team, 
and a rent of $1 per game will be charged. The city would also give a team all 
ticket, luxury box, parking and concession revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgrad was aware of the Rams' announcement that they were invoking an escape 
clause in their lease for Anaheim Stadium so they can explore the option of 
moving, but he said there has been little actual discussion between the two 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll be talking with the Rams, but after we lost a team nine years 
ago and went through the expansion race, we're going at it very cautiously, 
very slowly," Belgrad said. "Our package was on the table for expansion, and 
every franchise knows what we're offering. It's not necessary for us to come 
back and repeat it, because we can't better that offer." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Memphis Pro Football, Inc., which joined St. Louis and 
Baltimore in the expansion losers' bracket, are taking a similar tack toward 
the Rams. The group, headed by cotton merchant William B. Dunavant, had leased 
100 skyboxes and promised a $60-million renovation in the 68,000-seat Liberty 
Bowl in hopes of luring a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there has been any kind of rush to get involved with (the Rams) 
but we're going to look at them," said Pepper Rodgers, a former coach who is 
the group's spokesman. "We don't know if the Rams want to sell the team, move 
the team, or use us as sushi. No one knows where they're coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers said the group's efforts were contingent on owning a team but added, 
"If someone wants to move a team here, Billy Dunavant has said he would gladly 
step aside." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Gateway Group in St. Louis, where construction already has 
begun on a $258-million, 70,000-seat domed stadium, could not be reached 
Thursday, but it is believed their efforts have been focused on luring the New 
England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Aiello, NFL director of communications, said "it would not be proper to 
comment any further at this point" about a potential Ram relocation.

DUCKS' VICTORY SILENCES ROAR IN CHICAGO; HOCKEY: CORKUM SCORES TWICE, ADDS TWO 
ASSISTS AND BLACKHAWKS FALL, 6-2, IN A FIGHT-MARRED GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Remember the Roar," is the slogan for Chicago Stadium's final season, and the 
Mighty Ducks said goodby Thursday night by quieting the crowd in the old 
building with a 6-2 victory over the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was probably the best game our team has played all year," Coach Ron 
Wilson said. "To win, 6-2, in Chicago Stadium is an achievement, whether you're 
the Montreal Canadiens, the Vancouver Canucks or the Mighty Ducks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were shut out here last month, 2-0, by Chicago goaltender Ed 
Belfour, who twice has won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best. But they 
exacted their revenge Thursday, becoming only the third team this season to 
score as many as five goals against him. 
</P>
<P>
 After he allowed three of four shots in the second period, the famous roar of 
a crowd of 17,460 was reduced to sarcastic cheers when he stopped a clearing 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Corkum, who recently began centering the first line with wingers Garry 
Valk and Peter Douris, led the way for the Ducks with a four-point night. 
Corkum, who tied Terry Yake as the leading scorer with 29 points, scored his 
12th and 13th goals of the season and assisted on two others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawks tried to play physical hockey, and the Ducks outdid them. 
Chicago's Cam Russell and Tony Horacek earned game misconducts for instigating, 
and Duck enforcers Todd Ewen and Stu Grimson played their roles in a game that 
had six fighting and four roughing penalties. Grimson, an ex-Blackhawk, also 
had an assist. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing the Ducks weren't acknowledging after the victory is that 
they'll never play here again. With the stadium scheduled to close after the 
NBA season, the Ducks will say only that this is their last regular-season game 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping we play here in the playoffs," captain Troy Loney said. "We talked 
about that today. The way things are shaping up, we could end up playing 
against them. That would feel great." 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs are still quite a way off, but the Ducks are one point out of 
eighth place and the final Western Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can just manage a .500 record at home, we can put ourselves in the 
playoffs with a little luck," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 His team is 11-12 on the road, but only 5-12-2 in home games. 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs are what the Ducks talk about, but perhaps more remarkable is 
that at the 42-game halfway point, they are 16-24-2 -- on a precise pace to 
beat the first-year expansion team record of 31 victories by the Philadelphia 
Flyers and the Kings in 1967-68, though those teams played only 74 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The other thing is, the Ducks will have to beat the Florida Panthers too, who 
have won 16 after 38 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks trailed, 2-1, after one period. But they stormed back in the second 
as Belfour faltered. They tied the score, 2-2, only 19 seconds into a 
power-play on Tim Sweeney's shot from the middle of the right circle at 9:32. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit later, Sweeney picked up a five-minute high-sticking penalty and a game 
misconduct for cutting defenseman Neil Wilkinson. The Ducks faced five minutes 
of penalty-killing, and they had killed 59 seconds before Joe Sacco got out on 
a breakaway, and Eric Weinrich was whistled for hooking. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the teams playing four-on-four, Valk beat Belfour cleanly with a slap 
shot to the glove side at 14:37, with Belfour screened on the play. Less than 
two minutes later, Corkum scored shorthanded for his second goal of the game, 
letting loose with a slap shot after crossing the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensemen Bill Houlder and Sean Hill added goals in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year in Buffalo, it really felt like a job," said Corkum, who started 
the season as a checking center. "Here, every thing's positive. The team's 
playing really well right now. I got a good start and scored some goals in the 
first 13 or 14 games and started believing in myself and started shooting a 
little bit more." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Accusations by Duck Coach Ron Wilson and five other NHL teams that San Jose 
goaltender Arturs Irbe was playing with illegal pads were dismissed after 
Irbe's pads were checked last month. "They were measured and they complied," 
said Brian Burke, NHL senior vice president and director of hockey operations. 
Wilson accused Florida's John Vanbiesbrouck of cheating last week, saying after 
a 4-2 loss to the Panthers that he believed Vanbiesbrouck's pads were wider 
than the regulation 12 inches. Burke said this week he hadn't received any 
complaints about Vanbiesbrouck. Added Burke: "I suggest if he (Wilson) has 
criticisms he bring them to the league and not to the media." . . . . Right 
wing Steven King missed a second consecutive game with a sore back and was 
replaced by Patrik Carnback.

MIKE PENNER: SEEDS OF APATHY RAMS HAVE SOWN NOW GROW WILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Shaw, executive vice president of the Rams, was talking idly the other 
day about his team's immediate future -- what quarterbacks to pursue, what 
draft choices to make -- when the conversation turned, as it usually does these 
days, to his team's long-term future. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Anaheim really about to lose its professional football team to Baltimore, 
or Memphis, or St. Louis, or Katmandu? 
</P>
<P>
 "Does anybody care?" Shaw asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw wasn't attempting to be glib or flippant. He truly wanted to know, since 
he has seen the newspaper polls (the Big A apparently stands for "ambivalence") 
and watched the Anaheim city council steadfastly refrain from rounding up hoops 
through which to jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Does anybody care?  
</P>
<P>
 We are about to find out. Thursday, the Rams moved the first pawn in a chess 
match that might not play itself all the way out for months, even years, when 
they notified the city of Anaheim that they will exercise the escape clause in 
their Anaheim Stadium lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams thus become free agents, able to listen to any and all offers -- 
including Anaheim's, if it so chooses. Sixteen years ago, when the Rams were 
bored with life in the Coliseum and rattling their saber about moving, Anaheim 
turned cartwheels, balanced a beach ball on its nose and clucked like a 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was back when the Ram franchise ranked among the brightest jewels in 
the NFL crown. In 1978, the Rams were in the middle of their five-year reign 
atop the NFC West, annual Super Bowl contenders, when time was still on Chuck 
Knox's side, along with Jack Youngblood, Larry Brooks, Jack Reynolds and Dave 
Elmendorf. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Rams were worth debasing itself over, Anaheim felt. The NFL logo would 
finally designate the city as "big league," since the Angels weren't doing much 
to help the cause. And this wasn't just any football franchise. Tampa Bay could 
keep the Buccaneers -- Anaheim was getting the Rams , proven, trusted, on their 
way to the Super Bowl in their final Los Angeles season, with untold riches and 
sellouts awaiting them in Orange County in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 And now? 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Rams are the official dog food of the NFL. In the last four 
seasons, they are 26 games under .500. Four losing seasons in a row, the 
second-longest dry spell in the franchise's 57 years. (The record, if you're 
wondering, is seven consecutive losing seasons, 1959-65. Games Won: 25. Games 
Lost: 65. Head Coaches Lost: Sid Gillman, Bob Waterfield, Harland Svare.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams of the 1990s are 19-45. That's an average of 11.25 losses per season. 
That's worse than the worst stretch the franchise has ever seen. From 1959 
through 1965, the Rams averaged 9.3 losses. Of course, they played fewer games 
then, but a loss is a loss is a loss -- and by January of 1994, Orange County 
is sick and fed up. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county has lost interest, it's to the county's credit. Consumers are 
discerning here. This isn't Buffalo or Cleveland, where 80,000 ski masks would 
turn out every Sunday just to watch the goal posts rust. That doesn't make 
Buffalo or Cleveland fans better than Orange County fans. More bored, yes. More 
easily entertained, certainly. There, they'll swill rot-gut because it keeps 
them warm inside. Here, they hold out for a buoyant, full-bodied Merlot -- and 
if they can't find it at Anaheim Stadium, there's always the beach, or Anaheim 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to give Orange County a reason to come out to the park, and when's 
the last time the Rams fulfilled their part of the bargain? Handoffs to Jerome 
Bettis aren't enough. One has to go back to 1989 to find a Ram team worthy of 
the area's undivided attention. Ram-mania reached a fever pitch during that 
thrilling playoff run, but who was the doctor who prescribed cold compresses 
for the next 48 months? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the seeds of apathy were first sown in 1987, when Eric Dickerson ran 
47-Gap all the way to Indianapolis. If Jan. 6, 1994, is a milestone on the 
Rams' road to wherever, so, too, were these moments: 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 31, 1987: Rams trade Dickerson, the best running back in the history of 
the franchise, to Indianapolis for Greg Bell, Owen Gill, three first-round 
draft choices and three second-round draft choices. Because of a contract 
dispute, the county's most popular Ram is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 April 1988 and 1989: Rams waste the six picks acquired in the Dickerson trade 
on Gaston Green, Aaron Cox, Fred Strickland, Cleveland Gary, Frank Stams and 
Darryl Henley. Green is gone before the 1990 season, Stams before 1992, 
Strickland and Cox before 1993. Gary fumbles his way onto the bench and Henley 
misses the last 11 games of 1993 awaiting trial for federal drug-trafficking 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 14, 1990: Rams go to San Francisco, knock on the door of the Super Bowl, 
have door slammed in their faces, 30-3. Game hits Orange County like a sucker 
punch to the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 October-December 1990: Preseason favorites to reach the Super Bowl, Rams lose 
four of their first five games and finish 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
 October-December 1991: A burned-out John Robinson watches his team lose its 
last 10 games to finish 3-13. Robinson resigns at season's end. Last home game 
draws 35,315. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 8, 1992: Rams hire Knox, three months shy of his 60th birthday, to 
replace Robinson. It is a safe choice, but hardly a dynamic one. At the same 
time, losing teams in San Diego, Pittsburgh and Green Bay hire Bobby Ross, Bill 
Cowher and Mike Holmgren, all first-time NFL head coaches. San Diego and 
Pittsburgh win division titles in 1992, Green Bay makes the playoffs in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 January-June 1993: After a 6-10 season, Knox promises major improvements 
through free agency. Rams make no attempt to sign Reggie White, who moves to 
Green Bay. Despite three years of declining performance from Jim Everett, Rams 
refuse to sign a quarterback, such as Steve Beuerlein or Jeff Hostetler. Rams 
eventually spend $2.4 million on Shane Conlan, an injury-prone linebacker who 
gets pulled on goal-line situations. 
</P>
<P>
 July 1993: Knox predicts the Rams will make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 2, 1994: Rams close out a 5-11 season with a meaningless victory over 
Chicago. T.J. Rubley starts at quarterback. A crowd of 39,147 watches. Average 
home attendance in 1993 sinks to 45,401 -- an all-time low since the team's 
arrival in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder? 
</P>
<P>
 How many broken promises is a Ram fan supposed to endure? 
</P>
<P>
 What comes first -- fan loyalty to the team, or team loyalty to the fan? 
</P>
<P>
 So the Rams announce they are exercising their escape clause. Join the club. 
Orange County football fans exercised theirs long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They, like the Rams, are waiting for a better offer.

DUCKS ARE MAKING THE GRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks skated past the midway mark of their inaugural season 
Thursday night, and figuring them out is still a chore. 
</P>
<P>
 They are on pace to become one of the best expansion franchises in NHL history 
but until this week couldn't beat the other new teams. 
</P>
<P>
 They are 11-12-0 on the road but only 4-12-2 in sparkling, often raucous, 
Anaheim Arena. They also won a neutral-ice game against Dallas at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 They shut out the New York Islanders one night, then got shut out by the 
Washington Capitals two nights later. 
</P>
<P>
 They can't seem to score some nights, but they don't give up many goals, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we found a secret to our success: We need to get outshot," goaltender 
Ron Tugnutt said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Crazy as it sounds, he might have a point. 
</P>
<P>
 He means the Ducks should be on the defensive in most games, allowing shots 
but not good scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ducks might have outdone themselves in the last 16 games, when they 
went 7-9-0 but were outshot by 539-400. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-two game highlights include standout goaltending from Tugnutt and Guy 
Hebert, a 1-0 victory over Toronto at Maple Leaf Gardens on Dec. 15 and a 
six-game winning streak on Canadian ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowlights include a 1-8 record against Florida, Ottawa, San Jose and Tampa 
Bay, a 7-2 spanking by Detroit on opening night and 13 one-goal losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Any list of surprises must include the names of Bobby Dollas and Garry Valk, 
who have helped keep the Ducks surprisingly competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The wishful thinking award goes to the person who designed the "Skate for 
Eight" T-shirts the Ducks wore early in the season; the top eight teams is each 
conference qualify for the playoffs. Playoff teams usually finish with at least 
80 points; the Ducks are on pace to finish with 68. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Expansion Cup, the Ducks (16-24-2) still trail the Florida Panthers, 
whose 16-16-6 record includes two victories over the Ducks. Both teams could 
break the expansion record of 73 points set by the Philadelphia Flyers in 
1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the midseason report card: OFFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 Progress seems to be measured in halting steps for the Ducks, whose 111 goals 
is third-lowest in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 They miss Anatoli Semenov, their leading scorer until he suffered a dislocated 
elbow Dec. 7 in a collision with teammate Stu Grimson. 
</P>
<P>
 But Terry Yake has seven goals and six assists since Semenov's second-period 
injury against Florida. Yake and Bob Corkum lead the team with 29 points 
apiece. Yake has 15 goals and 14 assists and Corkum has 13 goals and 16 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrod Skalde has five goals and four assists since his Dec. 12 call-up from 
the Ducks' minor league affiliate at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bad news is that Semenov, who had 24 points in 29 games, isn't 
expected to return until February. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat I: In the 13 games since Semenov was injured, the Ducks have scored 
more than two goals only five times and been shut out twice. But they are 7-6-0 
since Dec. 7. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat II: Yake has 17 points (10 goals, 7 assists) in the last 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Grade: C+ DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 This is supposed to be the Ducks' greatest strength, but sometimes they seem 
to forget and it causes all sorts of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensemen Bill Houlder and Sean Hill have been caught out of position 
occasionally and the Ducks have paid the price. Houlder has 22 points, but is a 
minus-15 and Hill has 17 points, but is minus-six. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Dollas, a steady player who rarely makes a mistake, clearly has been the 
best Duck defenseman. He could have been the Ducks' All-Star representative, 
but the honor instead went to Alexei Kasatonov. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Ladouceur has lived up to his billing as a dependable, stay-at-home 
defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: The Ducks have allowed 126 goals, fewest in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Grade: B-, an improvement from a C+ after 21 games. SPECIAL TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Power-play efficiency: They continue to spend a startling amount of time 
chasing the puck during power plays. Will they get better? 
</P>
<P>
 Unless they trade for more goal-scoring, the answer is probably no. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: They're 22nd in power-play efficiency at 29 for 188 (15.4%). 
</P>
<P>
 Grade: C- 
</P>
<P>
 Penalty killing: It should come as no surprise that a defensive-minded team 
excels in killing penalties. They have allowed only 31 goals in 191 
short-handed situations, eighth-best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: They're the best in the NHL in killing penalties on the road, 
allowing 15 goals in 108 short-handed situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Grade: A, up from an A-. GOALTENDING 
</P>
<P>
 A clear-cut No. 1 goalie hasn't emerged, but so what. 
</P>
<P>
 No question, Hebert and Tugnutt are the midseason MVPs. 
</P>
<P>
 By rotating Hebert and Tugnutt, Coach Ron Wilson has kept them fresh and eager 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert is 7-12-1 with a 2.72 goals-against average and recorded the first 
shutout in team history Dec. 15 with a 1-0 victory at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt is 9-11-1 with a 2.77 goals-against average and he recorded the team's 
second shutout with a 3-0 victory over the New York Islanders Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt has been hotter lately, particularly on the road where he has a 2.00 
goals-against average in his last nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat I: The Ducks' goals-against average is 2.25 in the past 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat II: Of Hebert's 12 losses, nine have been by one goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Grade: A, up from a B. COACHING 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson earns high marks for his handling of the goaltenders, pushing the Ducks 
to a 11-12-0 road record and getting them to believe in his defensive style of 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 But you have to wonder about his whining about the width of Florida goalie 
John Vanbiesbrouck's pads after a Jan. 1 game in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, hockey's an emotional game, but what's up with that? 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, Wilson has handled his first NHL head coaching gig with 
as much polish as a 10-year veteran. The players seem to believe in Wilson's 
system and Wilson seems to have faith in the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Help, in the form of a trade, doesn't appear to be coming this season. General 
Manager Jack Ferreira continues to insist the best move is no move. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stats: The Ducks are 16-24-2 and credit, or blame depending on how you 
look at their record, falls on Wilson's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Grade: A-.

RAIDERS GRANTED TICKET EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With only about 54,000 tickets sold for Sunday's wild-card playoff game 
against the Denver Broncos, the Raiders were granted a two-day extension by the 
NFL to sell out the 67,800-seat Coliseum so that the local television blackout 
could be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 The league gave the Raiders until 1 p.m. Saturday to reach stadium capacity 
because of last weekend's New Year's holiday. The Raiders were also granted 
extra time last week to lift the blackout before their 33-30 victory over the 
Broncos.

TROJANS NEVER TRAIL, BUT FAIL TO PULL AWAY; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: USC HOLDS OFF 
OREGON STATE, 82-76, AFTER BUILDING A 19-POINT LEAD. ORR SCORES 21 POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best thing about USC's 82-76 victory over Oregon State on Thursday night, 
from the Trojans' perspective, was that the Trojans never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, there were not too many positives about USC's Pacific 10 
Conference opener. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans opened a 19-point second-half lead before holding on to improve to 
8-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a Sports Arena crowd of 3,128, USC struggled to put away the 
overmatched Beavers (4-6), who outscored the Trojans, 29-15, over a nine-minute 
span late in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense just lacked intensity and effort," USC junior Lorenzo Orr said. 
"That is the main reason why they came back on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Orr led USC with a game-high 21 points and 10 rebounds, with sophomore guard 
Brandon Martin adding 17 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a sluggish start in which the Trojans had six turnovers and only three 
assists,USC led at halftime, 43-31, after making 13 of 16 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans really took command of the game with aggressive defensive play to 
open the second half in taking a 56-37 lead on a breakaway dunk by Orr five 
minutes into the half. 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, is when things began to fall apart for the Trojans as Oregon 
State charged back behind the scoring of former Ventura College standout 
Stephane Brown, who scored 23 of his 27 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown scored from all over the floor as Oregon State closed to within 79-76 
with 20 seconds to play. USC was able to pull the game out by making five of 
six free throws down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that free throws are important," said reserve USC forward Tremayne 
Anchrum, who scored eight points and had eight rebounds in 17 minutes. "Our 
free-throw shooting in the second half (11 of 20 for 55%), however, should have 
been like we did in the first half (81.3%)." 
</P>
<P>
 What helped USC hold off the Beavers was its offensive rebounding. The Trojans 
outrebounded Oregon State, 47-33, with 25 coming at the offensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is evident from the statistics that the difference in the game was the 
backboard play by USC," Oregon State Coach Jim Anderson said. "They overpowered 
us on the offensive boards." 
</P>
<P>
 With senior Mark Boyd (12 points and only four rebounds) having an off night, 
USC got unexpected rebounding help from guards Martin and Stais Boseman, who 
had 10 and five, respectively. The Trojans also received added scoring from 
point guard Burt Harris, who came off the bench to score 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight was a clear indication of the obvious immaturity of our team," USC 
Coach George Raveling said. "We just lacked the maturity to be able to deal 
with game situations and administer them properly. We had the game put away. 
But we lacked intensity and defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan notes 
</P>
<P>
 Former USC standout and Miami Heat guard Harold Miner will be honored Saturday 
when the Trojans play Oregon at the Sports Arena at 11 a.m. USC is 46-5 in the 
Sports Arena since March of 1990, including a 26-2 record against Pac-10 teams.

DESPITE EFFORT, BRUINS EMERGE VICTORIOUS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: THEY SEEM MERELY 
TO GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS, BUT COME AWAY WITH 89-73 VICTORY OVER DUCKS IN 
PAC-10 OPENER. 
</P>

 So what was the matter with UCLA in its game against Oregon on Thursday night? 
</P>
<P>
 Did the Bruins get caught looking ahead to Oregon State? Did they think those 
were the Mighty Ducks they were playing? Were they bored or what? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a reason," said UCLA Coach Jim Harrick, who went on to describe 
the Bruins' performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not very good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final score will show an 89-73 UCLA victory in the Bruins' Pacific 10 
Conference opener, but the result was so ordinary that it probably left sort of 
a nagging feeling among many of the 10,116 at Pauley Pavilion that a team 
slightly better than Oregon would have won. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that if they're the No. 6-ranked team in the country, then 
we're all right," said Oregon guard Kenya Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are pretty good UCLA is going to be all right, too, even if the Bruins 
were immensely mediocre for one night. 
</P>
<P>
 The offense, such as it was, received its major contributions from Ed O'Bannon 
and Tyus Edney with 15 points, but also from backups Marquis Burns with 11 
points in 18 minutes and Cameron Dollar, who had five assists in 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the ranks thinned quickly. Harrick shuffled players as if he were 
playing cards. No one was safe from Harrick's hook, including Shon Tarver, who 
got yanked late in the game after he was called for traveling when he attempted 
a behind-the-back dribble. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tarver: "Uh, I think he was a little mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Harrick was a little peeved, but he managed to spread around his 
displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to do some things right," he said. "We didn't do some things 
right. . . . I didn't like our effort by some guys. We didn't play with any 
emotion, we didn't have any effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody tried, we just weren't effective." 
</P>
<P>
 If Makhtar Ndiaye, who watched the game from a third-row seat, still hadn't 
made up his mind between UCLA and Michigan, the first half probably was enough 
to have him checking the flights to Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ndiaye, a 6-foot-9, 240-pound freshman ineligible to play at Wake Forest, wore 
a green sweat shirt and a bemused expression before the game as a smiling 
Harrick busily schmoozed with him on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the game started, nothing seemed nearly so amusing. UCLA led, 43-33, at 
halftime, but wasn't all that impressive and the margin seemed a lot closer 
than that. 
</P>
<P>
 There were signs of difficulty. Like two shots attempted by Charles O'Bannon. 
Like the same amount of rebounds as Oregon. Like trouble running the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick's lineup midway through the first half: Ike Nwankwo, Kevin Dempsey, 
Burns, Dollar, Rodney Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
 Notice anything unusual, like no starters in the group? 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, it worked. Not three minutes later, UCLA's lead jumped from nine 
points to 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had one more run in the half, a 13-4 flurry, noteworthy mainly 
because of a four-point play produced by Edney and a three-point rainbow jumper 
by Tarver. 
</P>
<P>
 It got ugly fast. There were 11 points scored in the last 2:33 by the Ducks, 
including a feathery driving jumper by Wilkins, who was allowed to drive the 
length of the court in the last four seconds and score at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins hit the snooze button again in the second half. After Tarver's 
jumper to start the half, UCLA had only one other basket to show for the first 
5:16. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, George Zidek exited with one more point than fouls, the Bruins 
got nothing out of their offense except free throws and there was a certain 
restlessness growing in the stands at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O'Bannon listed the problems: "We didn't execute our offense, we 
didn't execute on defense, we didn't execute our game plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns' tip-in of a misfire by Charles O'Bannon gave UCLA a 63-49 lead that 
could scarcely have been less impressive.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE YEARNS TO FREE HIS FURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An everlasting memory of Winston Moss might be one from a previous season, 
when the rowdy Raider linebacker went after Denver quarterback John Elway the 
way a rodeo cowboy goes after a calf, riding him out of bounds, under a bench 
and into a stupor. It was neither the nicest nor proudest moment of young 
Winston's life, but football being a very serious business, all he can do about 
it today is nod and say: "Yeah, I remember that. That was a serious hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Gentlemanly conduct in combat might suit that other Los Angeles athlete who 
wears the numeral 99 on his shirt, the one who plays hockey, but something 
different drives Winston Moss. The man plays football with a fury, same way he 
did for the University of Miami's not-for-the-squeamish program, where 
wallflowers are unwelcome. Moss means what he says and says what he means. 
Should he hurt Elway's feelings, or anything else, tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elway doesn't like pressure. You've got to get under his skin," Moss says, 
pounding his fist into his palm for emphasis, counting the hours before 
Sunday's AFC playoff game. "We can definitely get to him. Elway doesn't want 
you in his face. He wants to sit back there with all the time in the world so 
he can do all the things he wants to do. You've got to let the man know that 
you're there. You've got to introduce yourself to him." 
</P>
<P>
 This is why, for weeks now, this overlooked weapon of the Raider defense has 
been imploring his coaches to give the linebackers the green light, to go get 
that quarterback. Moss wants to blitz. Game after game, he keeps waiting for a 
signal that the Raiders are ready to put into action some of that blitzing 
strategy that would make the Elways of the world see black shirts coming at 
them in waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have it in every week," Moss says, confounded. "We just don't use it." 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't second-guessing. He isn't exasperated. He's eager. The idea of Elway 
under siege is so appealing. And the idea of Elway having plenty of time to 
throw is so unappetizing. It is difficult for a player of Moss' passion to play 
with a controlled rage, rather than letting it all hang out. Collaring someone 
after a short gain isn't nearly as satisfying to a linebacker as coming at 
someone under a full head of steam, screaming as though he were no more human 
than a foam-stuffed tackling dummy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooling off after practice, Moss certainly seems sociable and at ease, a real 
pussycat. Yet something inside him often seems about to bust loose like lava, 
as an almost blood-curdling primal scream did once he and the Raiders had 
locked up last Sunday's wild 33-30 overtime victory over the Broncos. There on 
a sideline Moss stood, howling at the top of his lungs, punctuating the 
importance of the victory until he grew hoarse. Perhaps one of the TV networks 
Sunday will dig up that clip, that revealing look at Winston and the furnace 
that burns within. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss explains it by saying, "That was one of the most emotional games I have 
ever played. I was done. I was drained. I was gone, man." 
</P>
<P>
 Looked as though you really lost it out there, it is suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, don't worry. I can handle it," Moss said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 On so many successful teams, the linebackers become so prominent, Lawrence 
Taylor, Mike Singletary, Karl Mecklenburg, such very public figures, so mobbed 
in malls, so profiled by magazines, so credited with the defense's leadership. 
Not so with the Raiders, where the linemen and the deep backs bask in much more 
of the limelight. There are pretty knowledgeable football fans out there who 
could not on short notice identify who the Raider linebackers are , who could 
name no 99s other than Wayne Gretzky or the agent who worked with Maxwell 
Smart. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes Moss cross, a little. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make a lot of tackles," he says. "But nobody wants to hear about tackles." 
</P>
<P>
 They want to hear about sacks. Backers who are sackers get paid and praised 
the way home run hitters get preference over those who hit singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Moss has the proper attitude about it, saying, "I'll take a Super Bowl 
over any type of fame, anytime." 
</P>
<P>
 Young and strong, having turned 28 on Christmas Eve, he figures to have a 
crack at both. After enduring several seasons as a Tampa Bay Buccaneer, where 
he was dismissed by some as a trouble-maker, the Miami-born Moss has no 
objection to being far from home. All he wants is to play with players who take 
the game as seriously as he does. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss is pretty good at getting what he wants, as when he requested 99 as his 
uniform number and was told he couldn't have one outside of the 50s. "Why not?" 
Moss demanded, whereupon nobody could come up with an answer. He pursued it 
exactly the way he pursued John Elway, with everything he had. You want 
something in this business, you go after it.

BREAKING OUT; FORMER RAM ROBERT DELPINO TOOK THE ESCAPE ROUTE TO DENVER, WHERE 
HE FINDS HIMSELF IN PLAYOFFS AS THE BRONCOS' TOP RUNNING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a fear of close quarters, one that squeezes Denver tailback Robert 
Delpino through the smallest of gaps in the line and breaks him free in the 
tightest of situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is life inside the 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get inside there, my eyes get big and my heart starts pumping," he 
said. "It's more of a claustrophobic thing . . . where you want to get out of 
there, and the end zone is your only release." 
</P>
<P>
 That was just how Delpino felt last spring, when he left the Rams as an 
unrestricted free agent. He was looking for a release and he found one in 
Denver, where the Broncos were swift in signing him. 
</P>
<P>
 Delpino left town with bitter feelings about the last of his five seasons with 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 He believed they had used a training camp contract holdout against him, 
denying him a chance to regain the starting tailback role he had earned the 
previous season. He was the team's most valuable player in 1991, leading in 
rushing with 688 yards and catching 55 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 But he went from spectacular to spectator in 1992, starting only four games 
and playing in only 10, in part because he suffered a sprained left knee five 
games into the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It still bugs me to this day that a four-day contract holdout cost me a 
starting job," Delpino said. "They pretty much held that against me all season. 
I felt unappreciated after the kind of year that I had in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody got a chance to see what I could do because they (Rams) wouldn't play 
me. I was doing fine in practice, but I never got into a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months later, Delpino is getting every opportunity he could ask for -- 
and a trip to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he played at fullback most of the season, Delpino will start his 
second consecutive game at tailback Sunday when the Broncos play the Raiders in 
a wild-card game at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 He replaces Rod Bernstine, who has a separated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to be back in the playoffs," said Delpino, who hasn't been in a 
postseason game since the Rams reached the NFC championship game in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "This offense reminds me of the old days with the Rams, the 1988 and '89 
teams. Nobody could stop us then." 
</P>
<P>
 Delpino was a rookie, a fifth-round pick from Missouri, when the Ram offense 
was tearing up the league in 1988. He started only four games his first two 
seasons, when the Rams were a combined 21-11 and played in four playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams used him mainly as a utility player in his first three seasons. He 
had played wide receiver at Dodge City (Kan.) Community College, and his sure 
hands made him a logical target on routes out of the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Delpino's only season as the Ram starter was 1991. He scored 10 touchdowns, 
nine rushing, and was the only bright spot in a 3-13 season in which the Rams 
lost 10 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 He got off to a quick start -- 264 yards rushing in three games -- but slowed 
toward the end, leading the Rams to believe he couldn't physically handle 200 
carries a season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said I couldn't run, and I proved them wrong," Delpino said. "Then they 
said I couldn't catch, and I proved them wrong. Then they said I couldn't run 
and catch, and I proved them wrong again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been that way with me. The critics think they know everything 
about me, but they don't know anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Delpino had flourished in 1991 under coach John Robinson, but didn't get off 
to a good start with Chuck Knox, who replaced Robinson after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox's second run as Ram coach started without Delpino, who was holding out in 
hopes of renegotiating a $325,000 annual salary, well below what most starters 
are paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams didn't budge, but Delpino did. He returned a few days into camp, only 
to find Cleveland Gary establishing himself as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary rushed for 1,125 yards in 16 starts. Delpino had 116 yards in 32 carries 
and caught 18 passes for 139 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of playing time, coupled with the midseason knee injury, left Delpino 
frustrated, but not complaining, by season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not once did I say anything to the coaches," he said. "I figured that if 
there was a problem, they would come to me. I didn't want to be the one to 
complain." 
</P>
<P>
 But Delpino saw no future in the Rams' crowded backfield. Gary was the starter 
at tailback, and there were whispers that the Rams were taking a running back 
in the draft. That pick turned out to be Jerome Bettis, who finished second in 
the league in rushing as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 David Lang switched from tailback to fullback and emerged late in the season 
as the Rams' catch-and-run back. Rookie fullback Tim Lester was the team's top 
blocking back. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before all that, though, Delpino, an unrestricted free agent, knew that 
if the Rams didn't have a use for a pass-catching back, several other teams 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met with Coach Knox after the season and my role was never defined," 
Delpino said. "He said I had a spot on the team and that was all. I didn't want 
to be in the same situation I was last year, so I looked around. I felt they 
really made no effort to sign me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Phoenix, Atlanta, Kansas City and Denver did. 
</P>
<P>
 Delpino grew up in Dodge City and had followed the Chiefs and Broncos. So it 
was no coincidence that he narrowed his choices to those teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kansas City and Denver showed the most interest in me," Delpino said. "Kansas 
City was closer to where I grew up, but I came to Denver twice before signing 
and I was really impressed. Coach (Wade Phillips) showed so much interest, I 
knew this was where I wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver also was wooing Bernstine, and Delpino figured the Broncos would sign 
one of the two backs, but not both. He was wrong. Not only did the Broncos sign 
them, they started them. 
</P>
<P>
 Delpino fit perfectly into the Denver offense, which desperately needed a 
short-yardage back. Quarterback John Elway negotiated drives inside the 
five-yard line, and Delpino closed the deal. He scored eight touchdowns, all by 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 His receiving skills give Elway an extra target. Delpino has gained 445 yards 
in 131 carries and has caught 26 passes for 195 yards -- not stunning numbers, 
but a role player's numbers. And Delpino doesn't mind playing that role, 
especially when his team is winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver (9-7) is the first winning team Delpino has played on since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a couple of years where we struggled, and there were a couple of 
years where we had some success," Delpino said of the Rams. "I just felt that 
after last year, it was time for a change. And everything worked out for the 
better."

NBA ROUNDUP; TRAIL BLAZERS RALLY TO BEAT HORNETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cliff Robinson scored 21 of his 29 points in the second half as the Portland 
Trail Blazers came back from a 20-point halftime deficit to beat the Hornets, 
116-110, at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland took a 15-point lead on a basket by Jaren Jackson with 2:48 to play, 
but the Hornets made a comeback of their own, close to within 114-110 when 
Hersey Hawkins made a three-pointer with 32 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Two free throws by Rod Strickland, who finished with 25 points for the Trail 
Blazers, ended the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Strickland had 12 assists and Tracy Murray added 22 points for Portland, which 
played without its usual backcourt of Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter, who have 
sprained ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 102, San Antonio 98 -- Latrell Sprewell scored 22 points and made 
three free throws in the final 35 seconds as the Warriors, after blowing nearly 
all of the 15-point lead they had with 2:58 to play, held off the Spurs at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 96-81, the Spurs scored 12 consecutive points while the Warriors 
missed five free throws in a row and pulled to 96-93 on Willie Anderson's jump 
shot with 48 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Spur center David Robinson led all scorers with 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 92, Milwaukee 86 -- Charles Oakley tied his season high with 21 
points to help the Knicks survive a fourth-quarter collapse at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolando Blackman added a season-best 18 points for New York. New York didn't 
have a field goal in the final 5:40, but Milwaukee could get no closer than 
four points. 
</P>
<P>
 After Patrick Ewing's dunk gave New York a 20-point lead midway through the 
fourth quarter, Jon Barry sparked an 11-0 run with six points, pulling 
Milwaukee to 83-74 with 2:32 remaining. But Todd Day was short on a 
three-pointer, and Greg Anthony made two free throws to break New York's 
drought.

<P>
 The New York Knicks, their backcourt depleted because of injuries, Thursday 
acquired veteran guard Derek Harper from the Dallas Mavericks for swingman Tony 
Campbell and a 1997 first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks went after a guard when Doc Rivers was sidelined for the season 
because of a knee injury. Reserve guard Hubert Davis will sit out several weeks 
because of a broken bone in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Rivers' injury, Greg Anthony, a third-year pro, has stepped in as the 
Knicks' playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-4 Harper, an 11-year veteran, is the Mavericks' all-time leader in 
assists with 4,790; steals with 1,459, and three-point baskets with 645.

incentives. The Rockies eliminated the option year in their proposal, helping 
sway Harkey's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers signed left-handed pitcher Gary Wayne to a minor league contract 
with triple-A Albuquerque. Wayne, 31, appeared in 65 games with the Rockies 
last season and was 5-3 with one save. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas City Royals claimed outfielder Tom Goodwin on waivers from the 
Dodgers. Goodwin, 25, a left-handed outfielder, played in 30 games for the 
Dodgers last season, hitting .294. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Brady Anderson agreed to a three-year, $10.25-million contract with 
the Baltimore Orioles.

MORNING BRIEFING: IN TRUTH, INDIANS WERE NAMED AFTER A SPIDER 
</P>

<P>
 Even though the 35-foot high Chief Wahoo landmark has been removed from atop 
Cleveland Stadium, the Cleveland baseball team will retain its name, Indians, 
and logo despite protests from some Native American groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's media guide says the name honors Louis Sockalexis, the first Native 
American to play major league baseball. The Penobscot Indian played for the 
Cleveland team, then called the Spiders, for 94 games from 1897 to 1899. 
Sockalexis died in 1913 at 42. 
</P>
<P>
 The team nickname became Indians in 1915, the result of a newspaper's contest 
to give the team a new name. A contest participant suggested the name would 
honor Sockalexis. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Chief Wahoo: Rozelle Griffie, who is part Cherokee, videotaped the razing 
of Chief Wahoo and said he would miss the landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's like taking away a piece of your heart," he said. "It isn't insulting 
to Indians. It's no reflection on nobody; it's part of Cleveland."

 Trivia time: Who was the first basketball player in NCAA history to accumulate

 Limited competition: Iranian women may compete overseas in only five sports -- 
chess, shooting, equestrian, skiing and shooting for the handicapped -- because 
in other sports they would violate Islamic dress codes.

 Male spectators at last year's International Muslim Women's Solidarity Games 
in Tehran were banned from events at which competitors could not be fully 
covered.

 Brotherly love: Ed O'Bannon, a junior, and Charles O'Bannon, a freshman, form 
a powerful nucleus for the undefeated UCLA basketball team. Ed's comments on 
the sibling rivalry: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of big brother trying to keep up with little brother. Charles 
has always been that way. I don't doubt he'll outscore me this season. He has 
always jumped higher than me. Charles is a great player, and great players 
adjust." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead: Dallas city officials are thinking Super Bowl already. They 
have developed a proposal for a Cowboy victory celebration, should the team 
repeat as champion, in hopes that early planning will prevent the violence that 
plagued last year's parade. The plan scraps the parade and instead offers to 
honor the team with a pep rally at the Cotton Bowl.

 What does Jimmy Johnson think about this?

LAST IS BEST FOR DUCKS IN CHICAGO STADIUM; HOCKEY: THEY BID ADIEU TO VENERABLE 
BUILDING FOR THE REGULAR SEASON WITH A 6-2 VICTORY OVER BLACKHAWKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Remember the Roar," is the slogan for Chicago Stadium's final season, and the 
Mighty Ducks said goodby Thursday by quieting the crowd in the old building 
with a 6-2 victory over the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was probably the best game our team has played all year," Coach Ron 
Wilson said. "To win, 6-2, in Chicago Stadium is an achievement, whether you're 
the Montreal Canadiens, the Vancouver Canucks or the Mighty Ducks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were beaten here last month, 2-0, by Ed Belfour, who twice has won 
the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best goaltender. But they exacted their revenge 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After he allowed three goals on four shots in the second period, the roar of a 
crowd of 17,460 was reduced to sarcastic cheers when he stopped a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Corkum, who recently began centering the first line with wingers Garry 
Valk and Peter Douris, led the way for the Ducks with a four-point night. 
Corkum, who tied Terry Yake as the Ducks' leading scorer with 29 points, scored 
his 12th and 13th goals and assisted on two others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawks tried to play physical hockey, and the Ducks outdid them. 
Chicago's Cam Russell and Tony Horacek earned game misconducts for instigating 
fights, and Duck enforcers Todd Ewen and Stu Grimson played their roles in a 
game that had six fighting and four roughing penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing the Ducks weren't acknowledging after the victory is that they 
will never play here again. With the stadium scheduled to close after the 
season, the Ducks will say only that this is their last regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping we play here in the playoffs," said captain Troy Loney. "We talked 
about that today. The way things are shaping up, we could end up playing 
against them. That would feel great." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks are one point out of eighth place, the final Western Conference 
playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can just manage a .500 record at home, we can put ourselves in the 
playoffs with a little luck," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks are 11-12 on the road, but only 5-12-2 in home games. 
</P>
<P>
 At the halfway point of the season, they are 16-24-2, on a pace to beat the 
first-year expansion team record of 31 victories in 74-game seasons by the 
Philadelphia Flyers and the Kings in 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks trailed, 2-1, after a period. But they stormed back in the second 
when Belfour faltered. They tied the score, 2-2, only 19 seconds into a power 
play on Tim Sweeney's shot from the middle of the right circle at 9:32. 
</P>
<P>
 With the teams playing four-on-four, Valk beat Belfour cleanly with a slap 
shot to the glove side at 14:37, with Belfour screened on the play. Less than 
two minutes later, Corkum scored short-handed for his second goal of the game, 
letting loose with a slap shot after crossing the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensemen Bill Houlder and Sean Hill added goals in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year in Buffalo, it really felt like a job," said Corkum, who started 
the season as a checking center. "Here, every thing's positive. The team's 
playing really well right now. I got a good start and scored some goals in the 
first 13 or 14 games and started believing in myself and started shooting a 
little bit more."

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: IF THEY LOVE L.A., THEY HAVE A FUNNY WAY OF SHOWING 
IT

 Is Los Angeles in a sports slump or what? 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders failed to sell out Sunday's playoff game against the Denver 
Broncos before the deadline for lifting the television blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had to ask for an extension until 1 p.m. Saturday, since nearly 
14,000 tickets remained unsold at Thursday's 1 p.m. deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 A playoff sellout in any other NFL city is a given. But not in Los Angeles. A 
first-round playoff game between the Raiders and Pittsburgh Steelers at the 
Coliseum in 1983 didn't sell out and wasn't televised locally. It could happen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 In this market, one in which the other NFL team is threatening to move, 
anything is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add slump: Not only did Wisconsin fans vastly outnumber UCLA fans at the Rose 
Bowl, the television rating in Milwaukee was more than double the rating in Los 
Angeles, 48.1 to 20.8. 
</P>
<P>
 That's pretty impressive, particularly when you consider that it seemed like 
everyone in Wisconsin had come to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The joke making the rounds was: Did they tell the last person out of the state 
to turn out the light? 
</P>
<P>
 The one team Los Angeles could get behind, UCLA's unbeaten and No. 6-ranked 
basketball team, opened its conference schedule Thursday night against Oregon, 
but the game wasn't televised live. It will be shown on Prime Ticket today at 5 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Ticket, which had the Mighty Ducks on at 5:30, chose to show another 
Pacific 10 Conference game, Washington State at California, delayed at 10:30 
p.m. because, a spokesman said, it figured to be more competitive than 
UCLA-Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 At least both USC and UCLA will be on live television Saturday -- the Trojans 
against Oregon at 11 a.m. on Prime Ticket and the Bruins against Oregon State 
at 1 p.m. on Channel 5. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder an all-sports radio station didn't make it in Los Angeles? 
You can blame KMPC's failure on a lot of things, but No. 1 has to be the state 
of sports in an area that used to bill itself as the country's sports capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Latest word is that KMPC will be switching formats soon. 
</P>
<P>
 George Green, the general manager of Capital Cities-owned KABC radio, will 
also become the general manager of KMPC when the sale to Cap Cities goes 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 "In two or three weeks, I should be able to talk about our plans, and we 
should have a lot to talk about," he said. "But until the attorneys complete 
all the paperwork, I really can't say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ward, current general manager of KMPC and sister station K-LITE, will 
retain the position at K-LITE. He also declined comment until the sale goes 
through. He said it could be within a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is it true? Word is that Charlie Tuna may be the only on-air person retained 
by Cap Cities after the sale of KMPC, which means that Jim Healy, a radio 
institution in Los Angeles, may be out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard from anyone from Cap Cities or KMPC management," Healy said. 
"It would be silly for me to guess what will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a firm contract with KMPC that calls for me to do a nightly sportscast 
from 5:30 to 6 p.m. I fully intend to honor it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Too little, too late: Wouldn't you know it? Now that KMPC is all but sold, the 
station's ratings took a big jump in December. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest Arbitron figures, the share for men 18-plus went from 
0.6 in October to 1.2 in November to 2.3 in December. The rise in the main 
category, all people 12 and over, the monthly shares rose from 0.4 to 0.6 to 
1.2. 
</P>
<P>
 Program director Scott O'Neil said he could not confirm the exact numbers, but 
did say they doubled from November to December. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A wrist slapping: If a newspaper reporter were to write something close to 
what XTRA's Lee Hamilton said on the air last week and it somehow got in the 
paper, the reporter as well as his or her editor probably would be fired, or at 
least suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 As reported in this column last week, Hamilton told a caller named Sal: 
"You're a Raider fan so you probably carry a gun. Take that gun, put it in your 
mouth and pull the trigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton did get a slap on the wrist -- a $250 fine from station management -- 
but that's all. Actually, that's more than might be expected, considering the 
loose standards of sports-talk radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton tried to justify the tirade to program director Howard Freedman by 
saying that Sal cursed him, forcing him to hit the mute button. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sal, after reading that excuse in this column, called to say that he had 
not cursed Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I said to him, after he asked if I was a Raider fan, was: 'Darn right I 
am,' " Sal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sal identified himself as Salvador Garcia, 16, of Van Nuys, a student at 
Birmingham High.  
</P>
<P>
 Told Sal was a 16-year-old, Hamilton said: "I don't care what age he is." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he saw no reason to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 Told Sal denied cursing him, Hamilton said: "I can't remember who said what. 
There were four or five callers during a stretch there who were Raider fans and 
it seemed they were all abusive. I just got tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
 TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL playoffs begin at 9:30 a.m. Saturday and Sunday. ABC will televise the 
two Saturday games, with CBS and NBC sharing the Sunday games. Of course, it 
has yet to be determined if Los Angeles will get the Raider game on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 2's "L.A. Football Co." will be on Sunday at 8:30 a.m. The show got a 
4.0 rating last Sunday and, as usual, won in its time slot. Producer Dan Noel 
said the show will continue through Jan. 23 and will be back next season, even 
though CBS lost the NFL to Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox reportedly is planning to have a one-hour pregame show next season. Roy 
Firestone is one possible host, but also look for Prime Ticket's Alan 
Massengale to surface as another strong possibility. And Channel 11's Rick 
Garcia probably will figure in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 9 will televise a half-hour Raider playoff special, "Return to Glory," 
Saturday at 5 p.m. Former Raider radio commentator Rich Marotta is one of the 
hosts. Channel 9's Gary Cruz is the other. Susan Stratton is the executive 
producer, Jeff Proctor the producer. . . . Former Ram defensive end Fred Dryer, 
who went on to television stardom and always has something to say, will be an 
in-studio guest with Brian Golden and Doug Krikorian on KMPC Monday at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 John Rawlings, editor of the Sporting News, will be a guest of Irv Kaze on his 
6:30 show tonight on KIEV. Rawlings will talk about the Sporting News' list of 
100 most influential people in sports. One question: How is it that Jackie 
Autry went from No. 25 last year to off the list? The San Diego Chicken will be 
Kaze's first guest. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC led off its delayed U.S. Figure Skating Championships coverage Thursday 
night with footage of a shaken Nancy Kerrigan shortly after she was attacked. 
It was unnerving, to say the least. But then it was on to business as usual, 
with Julie Moran and Dick Button reporting the men's finals. The women's finals 
will be shown Saturday night, delayed, at 8. . . . Moran, who has been at ABC 
since 1991, earlier in the week was named the first female host of "Wide World 
of Sports," which began its 34th year Thursday night. Other hosts have been Jim 
McKay, Frank Gifford and, for part of last year, John Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings game: The Rose Bowl game got only an 11.2 national overnight rating. 
The Orange Bowl game between No. 1 Nebraska and No. 2 Florida State got an 18.9 
national overnight rating, and a 15.1 in Los Angeles. Fred Roggin's year-end 
special that followed the Orange Bowl on Channel 4 got an 11.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Great idea: ESPN, in association with Raycom, plans to televise a "Great 
Eight" series of college basketball games next Nov. 28 and 30. The participants 
will be the final eight teams from this season's NCAA tournament. . . . 
Attention golf fans: A new show, "LPGA Magazine," makes its debut on ESPN today 
at noon. Guests on the first show will be Dinah Shore, Amy Alcott and Betsy 
King. The weekly series will continue to be shown on Fridays, but at various 
times. . . . The Mercedes Championships at La Costa will be televised by ESPN 
today and Saturday, and by ABC on Sunday. . . . Florida State football Coach 
Bobby Bowden is scheduled to do an interview with Florida State alumnus Glen 
Walker for Prime Ticket's "Press Box" on Tuesday.

GOLF AT LA COSTA; OPENING-ROUND 69 GOOD ENOUGH FOR COUPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, when heavy rains turned La Costa into a swamp, the golfers on the 
PGA Tour made birdie after birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Azinger shot a seven-under-par 65 in the first round and Davis Love III 
won the opening tournament of the year at 10 under. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the first round of the Mercedes Championships Thursday, on a course in 
perfect condition, golfers had their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Couples, a flu victim for the last week, and three lesser-knowns shared 
the lead among players from the regular tour at 69, three under par. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensation from Fiji, Vijay Singh, Australian Brett Ogle and Nolan Henke 
also had a share of the lead on a day when only senior Dave Stockton burned up 
the course, shooting a 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Love shot a one-under 71. Only one shot off the lead was Greg Norman, who was 
in a group with Grant Waite, Scott Simpson and Phil Mickelson. Tom Kite was at 
73. 
</P>
<P>
 Most golfers, even after brilliant rounds, point out how they could have 
scored better. Couples, admittedly worn out from his illness and ready to go 
back to bed, had a different approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a bogey-free round," he said. "And I probably should have had several. 
I was only hitting the ball fair. I didn't have a really good shot all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, even though I don't feel well, even the bad rounds I play aren't bad. I 
haven't really had a bad score since I started practicing for the Ryder Cup 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said yesterday that I felt that to have a chance to win here, I needed to 
play a good round. A 73 or 74 would not have been a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoy this course, but I don't often have a good first round. I 
don't concentrate well when I'm sick, but I made several recovery shots and 
that saved me today. For instance on 10 (a 450-yard par four) I hit a horrible 
drive. It was 50 feet right. But I recovered to get the par." 
</P>
<P>
 Couples said Stockton's 67 was remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been playing so well," Couples said. "This will give him even more 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Couples said he thought he played well last year, but because of the turmoil 
surrounding his divorce, he didn't practice much. 
</P>
<P>
 "My plan this year is to practice more," he said. "But I got the flu last 
Thursday and I can't get rid of it. I didn't practice yesterday and I won't 
today. I'm just too tired. . . . But I feel better than I did yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Singh, a veteran of the European tour, was an instant success when he joined 
the U.S. tour last March. He finished second in the Nestle Invitational, his 
first event. In June he won the Buick Classic. And, when he shot a PGA 
Championship-record 63 in the second round, he was no longer an unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 The lean, 6-foot-2 long hitter plans to play in 20 tournaments on the U.S. 
tour this year and keep his playing card in the European tour by playing 11 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was invited only to play in five tournaments," Singh said of last season. 
"But everything went so well, I stayed to play 14 and earn more than $600,000. 
It was always my goal to play on the U.S. tour. I played better than I 
expected."

GOLF AT LA COSTA; AGE BEFORE BEAUTY WITH STOCKTON'S 67; SENIORS: LEADER'S SCORE 
IS TWO SHOTS BETTER THAN BEST OF REGULAR TOUR PLAYERS IN FIRST ROUND AT LA 
COSTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the Mercedes Championships began Thursday, the Senior PGA Tour brass 
voted to play from the same tees at La Costa Resort and Spa as the regular tour 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that meant the 50-and-older golfers had play a 7,022-yard course, the 
best score in the first round of the 72-hole, $1.5-million simultaneous 
tournaments was shot by a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stockton, named senior player of 1993 a few hours later, shot a 
bogey-free 67, five under par, and took a three-stroke lead in the senior 
division. Stockton, who won more than $1 million and five tournaments last 
year, was two shots better than the four players who share the regular-tour 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Douglass, a member of the senior board that decided to play from the same 
tees as the youngsters, sympathized with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shouldn't feel bad," Douglass said. "Dave's been beating us all year." 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are odd numbers in both tournaments, Douglass was paired with 
Rocco Mediate, from the regular tour, and shot a 71 to Mediate's 72. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus, playing as a senior in the event he won five times as a regular 
tour player when it was known as the Tournament of Champions, had trouble 
putting. He shot a 73 and trailed Stockton by six shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit the ball well, considering I haven't played in quite a while," Nicklaus 
said. "But my putting was nonexistent. It was encouraging that I was doing very 
well with my driver. But the putt I sank for the birdie on 18 was an exception 
to the way I putted. I very well could have been four strokes better." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton said he has no illusions about being the leader after 72 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great they decided to play from the same tees, but there's no 
way I'll finish best," he said. "I'm not concerned about their higher purse. 
I'm competing against seniors. That's all I'm concerned with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry we aren't playing just three rounds. No telling who will come 
around to beat me out." 
</P>
<P>
 He is becoming used to playing against younger players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no illusions about the juniors," Stockton said. "Heck, I got one in my 
family that I can't even beat. Ever since Dave Jr. led the qualifiers for the 
regular tour, he's been pounding me. He's making me a better player, too." 
</P>
<P>
 His other son, Ronnie, is a senior at Redlands, majoring in psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's my teacher," Stockton said. "At this stage of my career I only need that 
kind of teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Golf is now a family effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think of ourselves as Team Stockton," Stockton said. "Cathy (his wife) . . 
. was the only mother to caddie on the Nike (satellite) tour. I don't know what 
she's going to do about going to tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to play a full schedule because I want to prove last year was not 
fluke. But I'll be at Pebble Beach for the AT&T. I will be in the same foursome 
with Dave Jr., and hopefully Ronnie will be my amateur partner." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton said the difference in the tours was not in the distance of the 
courses, but in the severity of the roughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They play deeper, tougher roughs," he said of the regular tour. "That's why 
I'm proudest of a shot I made out of deep rough on the 12th hole. I mean, it 
was buried. If the marshal hadn't stuck a flag there, I wouldn't have found it. 
The sand-wedge blast put me six inches from the cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Charles was closest to the leader with a 70. Douglass was joined by Bob 
Murphy, George Archer, Lee Trevino and Jim Colbert at 71. Defending senior 
champion Al Geiberger was alone at 72. Leaders

SELES SAYS SHE ISN'T READY FOR AUSTRALIAN OPEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Monica Seles, who hoped to have recovered in time for this month's Australian 
Open, said Thursday she will skip the first Grand Slam tennis tournament 
because she is not in sufficient shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Seles, the former No. 1-ranked women's player, has been sidelined since an 
attack in Germany last April when a man ran from the stands during a tournament 
and stabbed her in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Seles' representatives did not elaborate on her physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Seles, 20, has been undergoing rehabilitation in hopes of competing in the 
Australian Open Jan. 17-30 in Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 Her withdrawal came on the same day skater Nancy Kerrigan was attacked in 
Detroit after practice for the U.S. Olympic figure skating championships.  
</P>
<P>
 Representatives said there was no connection between Seles' withdrawal and the 
attack on Kerrigan.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; USC RALLIES BEHIND ATWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reserve Tracy Atwater scored 10 of her 15 points in the second half as No. 
10-ranked USC rallied for a 63-56 victory over Oregon State on Thursday night 
at Corvallis, Ore., in the Pacific 10 Conference opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, 8-1 overall and 1-0 in the Pac-10, trailed, 50-41, with 7:55 to 
play, but went on a 22-6 run to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Leslie had 13 points and 14 rebounds in only 28 minutes as she got into 
early foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State is 8-3 and 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon 82, UCLA 77 -- The Bruins rallied from a 13-point deficit to get within 
one, but failed to overtake the Ducks at Eugene, Ore.

<P>
 Kentucky (11-1) won its ninth consecutive game and tied a school mark with its 
30th consecutive victory in Rupp Arena.

STANLEY LOSES APPEAL TO COACH USC WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marianne Stanley lost another legal battle Thursday in her attempt to coach 
the USC women's basketball team this season when a federal appeals panel 
refused to reinstate her until an $8-million sex discrimination suit against 
the school is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-0 decision, a panel with the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the 
Ninth Circuit in San Francisco upheld a district court's ruling on a pretrial 
motion that Stanley should not be returned as the Trojans' coach. She was 
replaced by former USC All-American Cheryl Miller last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Arthur Alarcon wrote in the decision that Stanley failed to show that 
her job was equal to USC men's Coach George Raveling's in terms of 
responsibility. Because the men's team generated 90 times more revenue than the 
women's team, Alarcon wrote that Raveling was under greater pressure to win, 
and that he had public relations and promotional duties that were not required 
of the women's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling is believed to earn an estimated $110,00 in base salary although his 
contract is not public. Stanley rejected offers of $288,000 for three years, 
and $96,000 for one year. When she allowed her contract to expire last summer 
and the school began searching for a replacement, Stanley sued USC and Athletic 
Director Mike Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley's lawyer, Robert Bell of Washington, said the ruling does not end the 
fight to reinstate Stanley, who this week was named to a part-time marketing 
position with the Stanford women's program. Bell said he will ask the Ninth 
Circuit as a body to consider the arguments that the three-member panel 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell said he is continuing the effort instead of regrouping for the impending 
trial because Stanley wants to coach this season's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell her to walk away from what is a part of her life," Bell said.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; SIMMS HINTS AT RETIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Phil Simms dropped a bombshell on the New York Giants, saying there was no 
guarantee he would play in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Simms, 38, said he would wait until after the season to consider his plans, 
but it marked the first time the 15-year veteran has ever mentioned the 
possibility of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'm going to do," Simms said after the Giants' practice 
Thursday, in preparation for Sunday's NFC wild-card playoff game against the 
Minnesota Vikings. "I really haven't thought about it. When the season is over 
I'll sit down and think about it. But it's not 100% that I would come back next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Reeves, who led the Giants to an 11-5 record, was named coach of the year 
by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves, who led the Broncos to three AFC championships in his 10 years as 
coach, was fired in Denver partly because of a feud with Elway. He was the 
third choice of Giant General Manager George Young to replace Ray Handley. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought stability and confidence back to a team that went from Super Bowl 
winners under Bill Parcells to 14-18 in Handley's two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Rod Woodson of the Pittsburgh Steelers was selected as the NFL's 
defensive player of the year by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 A big-play specialist, Woodson had eight interceptions this season, returning 
one for a touchdown. He also is a punt returner. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie White of the Green Bay Packers finished second with 12 votes and 
cornerback Deion Sanders of the Atlanta Falcons and defensive end Bruce Smith 
of the Buffalo Bills tied for third with nine votes each. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, who played in only 11 games, spent the first month of the season 
playing baseball with the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Collins, the best cover man in the Giants' secondary, sprained his left 
knee in practice and his status for Sunday's game is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 A release by the Giants described Collins' injury as a mild sprain. It said he 
was to undergo a test Thursday night as a precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Jacksonville Jaguars said they have sold out the renovated Gator Bowl for 
their first three seasons of NFL play. 
</P>
<P>
 David Seldin, president of the Jaguars, who made the announcement at a news 
conference, said the Jaguars sold 56,000 regular-season tickets in the first 30 
days since the franchise was awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 That, added to 10,000 club seats and more than 3,000 luxury-suite tickets 
already sold, means that about 70,000 season tickets have been purchased.

RAMS WILL PUT ANAHEIM ON NOTICE MAY 3; PRO FOOTBALL: TEAM WILL TELL CITY IT 
WILL VACATE STADIUM IN 1995, BUT ACTION CAN BE REVOKED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS and TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams will give formal notice on May 3 that they will vacate Anaheim 
Stadium 15 months later, the team announced Thursday. But the action is 
revocable, and the game plan remains classified: Will the Rams open the 1995 
season elsewhere? Or will the city of Anaheim hold on against the advances of 
would-be suitors? 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, the club's executive vice president, is the driving force behind 
the decision and will take on all comers in a high-stakes game for the Rams. 
But the ultimate decision might come down to the preference of Georgia 
Frontiere, the Rams' owner, a fixture in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Thursday the team would invoke the escape clause in its 35-year 
stadium lease by making a required $2-million payment by May 3. The clause is a 
product of 1990 negotiations that removed the Rams as an impediment to 
construction of the Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Shaw said the Rams had three options: moving elsewhere in 
Southern California, moving out of state or staying put. The club reserved the 
right to revoke the notice, and while the $2 million is not refundable, the 
Rams expect to receive that much -- and a lot more -- in considerations if they 
remain in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said city officials will meet with Shaw within 10 days, 
but no list of demands is expected. Rather, Shaw will sit back and allow the 
bidding to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's deadline for a decision on whether the Rams intend to leave is Feb. 
11, 1995, no later than 30 days before the league's annual meeting in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 The team could also ignore those rules and sue to clear the way for a move at 
any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Rams and city officials question whether Anaheim can be competitive 
with Baltimore, St. Louis or Memphis, which have promised all but an open 
checkbook to any team willing to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Councilman Bob D. Simpson: "The city is severely limited in what it can 
offer the Rams. (Our) enhancements are peanuts compared to what other cities 
are offering." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, top Anaheim officials on Thursday seemed to be hanging their hopes on 
a change of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 But that might be misguided. In a recent interview, Frontiere said 
emphatically that she has no intention of selling and that she had already 
turned down an offer of as much as $300 million, almost double what analysts 
suggest the team is worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would I buy with the money?" she said.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; COACHES EXPECT DIFFERENT GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After learning that the Denver Broncos would have to play the Raiders again in 
a wild-card playoff game after playing them last Sunday, Bronco Coach Wade 
Phillips did not hesitate to predict a different game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to a lot harder for both teams to move the ball," Phillips said 
after watching the two teams combine for 63 points and 869 yards in total 
offense. "I know that it looks like we'll have to change some things on 
defense, coverage-wise." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Raider Coach Art Shell: "I'm sure you'll see some adjustment by both 
teams. We sure can't let John (Elway, the Broncos' quarterback) throw the ball 
like he did against us Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After giving up seven sacks against the Raiders in October, Denver's offensive 
line pitched a shutout against the Raiders' pass rush last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider middle linebacker Joe Kelly said that the Broncos were determined not 
to let anyone get to Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime one of our defensive linemen got past one of their blockers, you 
could hear them hollering, 'Here they come'," Kelly said. "I expect them to do 
what was successful for them again, like throwing quick passes and anything 
else to avoid a lot of sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "For one game, you can't overhaul your entire offense. You have to stay with 
what you do best. After playing each other twice, we know what they do and they 
know what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the Raiders were able to slow Elway in the second half last week 
was that they blitzed more than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to sustain a consistent rush for nearly three quarters, the Raiders 
blitzed linebackers and a safety to break Elway's rhythm and it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point of the game, we needed to put pressure on him," Kelly said. "He 
was picking us apart until we started sending people after him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams are hurting for Sunday's game. For the Raiders, fullback Steve 
Smith (ankle), defensive tackle Nolan Harrison (ankle), safety Derrick Hoskins 
(leg), wide receiver Rocket Ismail (neck), cornerback James Trapp (groin) and 
running back Greg Robinson (knee) did not practice Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, Harrison, Hoskins and Ismail are expected to play. Rookie safety 
Patrick Bates, who has not played since injuring his leg against Seattle on 
Dec. 12, has not returned to practice.  
</P>
<P>
 Denver will be without defensive end Dan Williams, who injured a knee last 
Sunday. Linebacker Dave Wyman (toe/thumb), tight end Reggie Johnson 
(hamstring), cornerback Charles Dimry (hip), running back Robert Delpino (toe) 
and wide receiver Derek Russell (ankle) are listed as questionable. LONNIE

SANTA ANITA; OFFICIALLY, IT CAN BE TOO QUICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Years ago, trainer Red Terrell and his rider, Cash Asmussen, were walking back 
to the jockeys' room minutes after a race at Belmont Park. Their horse had 
finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second horse claimed foul against the winner," Terrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah?" Asmussen said. "The second horse bothered my horse a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Terrell stopped in his tracks, grabbed Asmussen by the arm and ran back to the 
winner's circle, where they phoned the stewards with their own foul claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The stewards, ruling that the winner had interfered with the second-place 
horse, took his number down. Upon further review of the videotape, they decided 
that the second-place finisher also had committed a foul. Terrell's horse was 
moved up from third to first. Improbably, Asmussen had ridden a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is relevant because of an item on the agenda for next Tuesday's 
California stewards committee meeting in San Francisco. They will be discussing 
whether the state should again consider using the quick official after races. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick official, a concept that has caught on in several states and Canada, 
requires that jockeys claim foul before they dismount, telling outriders, who 
phone the stewards. Track managements say that by posting the "official" sign 
sooner, the time between races is reduced and bettors receive their payoffs 
quicker and have more time for handicapping the next race. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but is saving a couple of minutes each race worth a compromise in 
fairness? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big concession that you make," said Sheila Gaudreau, a Bay Meadows 
steward. "Quick official does work, but I've worked in states that have it and 
states that don't, and I'm not necessarily for it or against it. But the thing 
is, if you decide to use it, make sure you do it right." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, before Gaudreau arrived at Bay Meadows, the San Mateo track ran the 
$250,000 Final Fourteen Stakes. Allijeba beat Tex's Zing by a nose, but when 
the winner's jockey, Ricky Frazier, weighed in after the race, the clerk of 
scales found that he was carrying three pounds less than he was assigned. The 
stewards acted quickly, declared Allijeba a non-starter and gave the victory to 
Tex's Zing. Frazier was given a 60-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Had quick official been in effect, the numbers of the horses and their mutuel 
prices would have been posted before Frazier weighed in. Those who had bet on 
Tex's Zing would have been beaten by a horse whose jockey had broken a rule. As 
it was, bettors with money on Allijeba got refunds because of his non-starter 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 "California was on the verge of approving quick official at that time, but 
that race changed everybody's mind," said Cliff Goodrich, president of Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodrich hopes quick official will be approved now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bay Meadows race was an isolated instance," he said. "Something like that 
isn't going to happen often, and if it does happen once every five years, we're 
just going to have to live with it. The advantages are the overriding 
consideration here. What we hear most from our patrons is shortening the time 
between races, and with the influx of races from Northern California on our 
programs, there's going to be continued emphasis are getting the programs 
finished in good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey complaints about quick official have been rare. Kent Desormeaux, who 
came to California in 1990, used to ride under the rule in Maryland and says it 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaudreau said, "Under quick official, a disqualification for a jockey coming 
back light would have to be treated like a horse getting a drug positive. The 
public would already be paid off, but the purse money would be redistributed." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Chamblin, president of the Assn. of Racing Commissioners International, 
can visualize quick official causing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quick official is not in the model racing rules that we recommend to all the 
states," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Pedersen, a steward at Santa Anita, is against quick official, but 
suspects that it will eventually be approved by the California Horse Racing 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Riders from New York, where they don't have quick official, come out here to 
ride in stakes," Pedersen said. "You can remind them all you want about it, but 
in the heat of battle, I can see where they might forget and get off the horse 
expecting to claim (foul). 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think quick official will save any time at Santa Anita, anyhow. The 
jockeys' room is quite a distance from the track, and that's what eats up extra 
time. You've got to give the jocks a reasonable amount of time to get back 
there, wash their faces and change clothes for the next race." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Cardmania, winner of the Breeders' Cup Sprint and likely to be voted national 
sprint champion for 1993, makes his first start this year, facing seven 
opponents Saturday in the $100,000 San Carlos Handicap at Santa Anita. The 
8-year-old gelding will carry 122 pounds in the seven-furlong race, five pounds 
more than The Wicked North and Monte Bleu. Others entered are Exemplary Leader, 
Portoferraio, Davy Be Good, Charts and Arrowtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Wayne Lukas reported improvement in his son, Jeff. "His cerebral 
pressure is better, and there was more movement of his hands. He put his hand 
up to his face at one point." Jeff, his father's chief assistant, has been in a 
coma for more than three weeks after suffering multiple skull fractures while 
trying to flag down a horse in the Santa Anita barn area. His condition is 
listed as serious.

 El Modena Coach Alan Clinton said anyone in Orange County who loves wrestling 
would be "stupid to miss (tonight's meet)." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton might be understating the interest level for the county's wrestling 
showdown of the season, when top-ranked Calvary Chapel faces No. 2 El Modena in 
a nonleague dual meet at 7 tonight. Anyone with a passing interest in the sport 
should arrive at Calvary Chapel's Santa Ana gym early enough to reserve a seat. 
</P>
<P>
 This has the potential to be quite a match. It is the first time the 
high-powered programs have met and the first time in Calvary Chapel Coach John 
Azevedo's recollection that the county's top two ranked teams have competed 
head-to-head during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams have been tested. Calvary Chapel (9-0), ranked second in the nation 
by the Amateur Wrestling News, finished third at the prestigious Ironman 
Tournament in Ohio and won a 70-team tournament in Reno last month. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena hasn't exactly scheduled cream puffs. The Vanguards (18-0) finished 
third behind El Cajon Granite Hills and Poway at an established San Diego 
tournament and won the 16-team Iolani Invitational in Hawaii last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton downplayed the significance of the highly anticipated matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're treating it like any other match," he said, although he added that 
there were more than the usual nauseous wrestlers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Azevedo said this kind of match is good for the sport and the competitors. "It 
creates some publicity and excitement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the mat, several weight classes promise to provide the latter. There are 
three divisions in which Calvary Chapel's top-ranked wrestlers meet the 
second-ranked wrestlers from El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 At 135, Southern Section champion Mauricio Mora wrestles Juan Alvarez, El 
Modena's only undefeated wrestler; at 145, the Eagles' section champion Josh 
Holiday goes against the Vanguards' State qualifier Chris Jaime; and at 152, 
Calvary Chapel's section champion Ed Mosley meets sophomore Aaron Santana. 
</P>
<P>
 The match also features Eagle twins Shane and Dane Valdez. At 119, Shane is a 
two-time State runner-up and at 125, Dane is the defending State champion. For 
El Modena, David Wells is the defending section and Masters champion.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: PASSERS RAN, NOW THEY CAN'T HIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Mike Kocicka of Hart High couldn't believe what he was seeing when 
UCLA's Wayne Cook took off running with no timeouts and 15 seconds left in the 
Rose Bowl game. Cook, of course, couldn't get the Bruins together for another 
play, and thus a nightmarish afternoon for UCLA ended at the Wisconsin 14-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I thought, 'Who would ever run the ball in that situation?' " said 
Kocicka, who did just that, to the opponent's five-yard line, as time ran out 
in Hart's 44-42 playoff loss to Dominguez in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the final seconds rushed off the clock in Wisconsin's 21-16 victory -- 
and as Cook frantically tried to line up his team -- Kocicka realized he was 
reliving the low point of his 2,966-yard, 32-touchdown senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone at school calls me Wayne Cook now," Kocicka said. "Maybe they should 
be calling him Mike Kocicka. I can feel for Wayne Cook. I know what he's going 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Why didn't Cook and Kocicka use better judgment in that situation? 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kocicka: "You don't ever practice (what to do with) 15 seconds left in 
the biggest football game of your life. I just reacted and tried to get the 
ball in the end zone." FOOTHILL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Those Other Kids 
</P>
<P>
 For those who think the Hart basketball team -- sporting a 15-1 record and The 
Times' No. 1 ranking in the region -- is ready to run away with the league 
championship, think again. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon is 13-4, having won 11 of 12 games without much fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "They deserve all the attention," Canyon Coach Greg Hayes said of Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon could get a lot of attention if it can beat rival Hart on Saturday 
night in the first of three games against the Indians. Canyon already has 
surpassed its victory total of last season with a group of players who aren't 
accustomed to winning. The current senior class won six games as freshmen, the 
juniors only three. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you measure success on wins and losses, we're up and down," Hayes said. 
"But if you measure success in terms of improving from your freshman year to 
your senior year, there's a lot of success here." MISSION LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Pucker Up 
</P>
<P>
 The last thing Harvard-Westlake's Scott Garson was expecting as he guarded 
Cameron Murray, Glendora's USC-bound senior, was a kiss, but that's what he 
got. 
</P>
<P>
 Garson and Murray are good friends from American Roundball Corp. games, and 
their high school teams met in the championship game of the Covina tournament 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 As Murray tried to set up to take an inbounds pass toward the end of the first 
half, Garson was all over him. So, just to throw Garson off and get a little 
room, Murray kissed him on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Shocked, Garson momentarily stepped back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty weird, but he laughed it off and I laughed it off," Garson 
said. "I got back and told him never to do that again, and he said not to worry 
about it." Around the Leagues . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Nordhoff guard Mark Sebek, who averages 25.3 points a game, set a school 
record with 40 points against St. Bonaventure. He broke Tim Siefken's record of 
37, set against Santa Paula in 1975. Sebek entered the week with 1,128 points, 
No. 2 on the Rangers' all-time list behind his older brother, Tim (1,664). 
</P>
<P>
 * Canyon's recent eight-game winning streak was the second longest in school 
history. During the streak, the Cowboys scored an average of 82 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 * Matchup we'd like to see: Chatsworth senior point guard Philbert Hernandez 
(5-foot-4) and Birmingham junior point guard Marc Fernando (5-4), who each rank 
among the area's peskiest defensive backcourt players.

LIFTING SCHOOL TO NEW HEIGHTS; ONLY FRESHMEN, RANGY COLLINS TWINS PUSH HARVARD 
TOWARD RESPECTABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If their orthodontist is right, Jason and Jarron Collins are going to be 
really dangerous on a basketball court in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, looking in the mouths of Harvard-Westlake High's newest stars, the 
dentist judges the two have three or four inches of growth remaining. The twins 
turned 15 last month and Jason is already 6-feet-8 while Jarron is 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Three or four more inches? Can the dentist be right? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a little frightening," said Crespi High Coach Paul Muff, who watched 
the freshmen lead Harvard to a 32-point victory against the Celts a couple 
weeks ago. "Our league isn't that big, and I think that gives Harvard a little 
bit of an advantage on everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The once-hapless Wolverines bring a 13-0 record, 3-0 in Mission League play, 
into tonight's game at home against Loyola (8-5, 3-0), the consensus league 
favorite. Loyola beat Harvard twice by a combined 73 points last season. But, 
thanks to the Collins twins, the Wolverines actually have a chance to win this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 It's surprising when you consider Harvard is a school in which you're more 
likely to find championship banners for water polo and tennis -- even something 
called the academic team -- than basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 The basketball tradition revolves around the 1990 team, which had a No. 1 
ranking in a small-schools division, largely because of a roster full of 
all-star volleyball players tall enough to dunk a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Harvard was 5-20. The tallest player was center Don Katz, all 
6-feet-2 of him. But he didn't play even that tall. Rebounds were rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 After the season, Coach Greg Hilliard heard rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody told me that these two kids who had applied to our school were two 
of the best 14-year-olds in the country," Hilliard said. "I laughed and said, 
'We'll probably never see them.' But then they were accepted and I started to 
get excited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I saw them duck their heads when they came in the door." 
</P>
<P>
 The Collins twins figured to be tall. Their father, Paul, is 6-4 and their 
mother, Portia, is 6-feet. One grandfather is 6-3 and the other 6-5. An uncle 
is 6-8 and an aunt 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The twins, who are identical and most easily distinguished off the court 
because Jason wears high-top shoes and Jarron does not, have no siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jason and Jarron grew, they abandoned other sports in favor of basketball. 
They rose through the system in the American Roundball Corp., playing in 
all-star tournaments against older players. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, the two were the first eighth-graders to play in the ARC national 
high school tournament in Las Vegas, ARC president Rich Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always played against people stronger and bigger and older than us," 
Jason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stronger and older, sure, but bigger? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, when we were smaller," Jason said. "Like 6-4." 
</P>
<P>
 They attended junior high at Montclair Prep, spending two years in eighth 
grade because they started school a year early and had been among the youngest 
in their class, they said. They enrolled at Harvard for ninth grade, even 
though they had to travel from their home in Granada Hills to the school's 
campus in Bel-Air, site of the middle school that includes the freshman class. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Collins, who works in the employee benefits department of an insurance 
company in Universal City, has sent his sons to private schools since 
kindergarten because of the academics. In fact, he considered starting Jason 
and Jarron at Harvard in the seventh grade, but "We felt three years driving 
over the hill would be a bit much." 
</P>
<P>
 The academics at Harvard surely impressed the Collins family. Because the 
basketball team surely did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Coinciding with the Wolverines moving up from the San Fernando League to the 
more competitive Mission League last season was one of the shallowest talent 
pools in Hilliard's nine years at the school. They were 1-13 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part was they were basically good kids but had very little chance 
to compete in this new league they were in," Hilliard said. "It was hard to 
explain that maybe winning wasn't our goal going into every game. We had to set 
our sights a little lower." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Wolverines lacked was height. Teams pounded them inside on offense 
and spread out on defense to take away the outside shots, Harvard's only 
weapon. The Collins twins have changed all that. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason, more of a true post player than Jarron, is averaging 17.5 points, 10.8 
rebounds, 2.7 blocks and shooting 73.8% from the field. During last week's 
Covina tournament, he averaged 14.8 points and 10.2 rebounds, leading the 
Wolverines to the title and earning a share of the MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarron is a guard in a forward's body. He hangs around the foul line, shooting 
jumpers and dishing off. He even brings the ball upcourt now and then. Last 
season, at 6-5, he played point guard for the junior high team at Montclair 
Prep. He is averaging 8.9 points and 6.8 rebounds this season. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd like to think they play some nasty games of one-on-one. Not. Haven't 
played each other in a few years, they said. Too busy for that. They save their 
best for their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very impressed with both of them," Muff said. "We had them on film and 
they were much better in person. I was totally impressed with their poise. They 
don't play anything like freshmen." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the praise -- and it comes from all corners -- the twins remain 
level-headed. They reject the notion that the turnaround is solely because of 
their presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've earned all the respect from everybody," senior guard Scott Garson 
said. "I would get all over them if I saw any type of ego, but there is none of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are quiet and a little shy off the court, they don't hesitate to 
respond verbally or physically to challenges on the court. Most opponents look 
at the slender boys and figure the way to stop them is to push them around. But 
that hasn't worked. They aren't as scrawny as they look. Jason weighs 210, 
Jarron about 200. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have attitude," Alemany Coach Robert Webb said. "We have some freshmen 
with attitude but they are on the freshman team. They have attitude and they 
back it up."

SPEEDSKATING; JANSEN'S ATTITUDE POSITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jane Danielle Jansen, a lively 7-month-old, doesn't know that her daddy, Dan 
Jansen, was the first speedskater to race the 500-meter sprint in less than 36 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't know he fell twice at the 1988 Calgary Olympics after learning 
that his sister, whose name she carries, had died of leukemia. She doesn't know 
that at the Albertville Games in 1992, he finished a disappointing fourth in 
the 500 and 26th in the 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Her love is unconditional, and that has changed Dan Jansen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've come to the rink every day with a little bit different perspective," he 
said. "It started when Jane was born. Skating is not less important, but 
there's something way more important. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even days when things don't go good, she's there. Robin (his wife) tells me 
when I go to the line, she's in her lap, yawning. She doesn't know what I'm 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, she'll appreciate what he has accomplished -- and what he's striving 
for this weekend, when the U.S. Olympic long-track trials resume at the Pettit 
National Ice Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen, of Greenfield, Wis., overcame flu last weekend and set track records 
in the 500 and 1,000 in the first phase of the competition. He has a solid lead 
in the 1,000-meter standings, with one race left; and in the 500, with two 
races left. He will compete again tonight in the 1,500 after finishing third to 
Brian Wanek and Nathaniel Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen is approaching this weekend, and World Cup races in Milwaukee later 
this month, with a decidedly positive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, these are confidence builders," he said. "We're getting close to the 
Olympics, so it's getting more important now for my confidence and general 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Three-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair of Champaign, Ill., boosted her 
confidence with five track records last weekend. She's well ahead of the 
women's field in the 500, 1,000 and 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend's events will feature former in-line skater KC Boutiette, an upset 
winner in the first men's 5,000 race. His time of 7:07.49 was 20 seconds faster 
than his previous best, but about 12 seconds off the likely cutoff for Olympic 
entrants. Chantal Bailey of Boulder, Colo., also will try to earn her first 
Olympic berth. She was second to Blair last weekend -- twice in the 1,000 and 
once in the 1,500 -- and won the first staging of the 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States can send up to four skaters to Lillehammer in the men's and 
women's 500, 1,000 and 1,500. Three positions are allotted for the men's 5,000 
and the women's 3,000. Entrants for the men's 10,000 and women's 5,000 will be 
limited to those with the world's 32 fastest times in each race.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW BREAKS THROUGH 3,800 TO ANOTHER RECORD; YIELDS FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * A burst of buying in blue-chip stocks propelled the Dow 
Jones industrial average through the 3,800 barrier to another record high close 
Thursday, but the rest of the market gave an uninspiring performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields plunged, pushing prices sharply higher after Labor Secretary 
Robert B. Reich suggested that Friday's key jobs report may fall below market 
expectations. The dollar also rebounded against most currencies. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 5.06 points to close at 3,803.88, 
beating Wednesday's record close of 3,798.82, on active volume totaling 367.88 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing issues outnumbered declines on the Big Board by fewer than 20 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most broadly based market measures receded despite the strength in cyclicals. 
The New York Stock Exchange composite fell 0.31 to 259.00 and the Standard & 
Poor's 500-stock index dipped 0.43 to 467.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other market indicators, the Nasdaq composite gained 2.36 to 780. The 
American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.21 to 479.00. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's strength provided a positive backdrop for stocks, as did a 
perception that economic growth may have moderated to a slow enough pace to 
keep inflation and interest rates from rising substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors favored cyclical issues, which are stocks of companies sensitive to 
economic changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts did not attach too much importance to the Dow industrials reaching 
another new high. They noted that the advance occurred during a so-so session 
in which many stocks had big losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I don't think going through 3,800 is particularly significant," 
said Will Weinstein, senior partner at Genesis Merchant Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Heading the active issues on the NYSE was Circuit City, which skidded 4 1/2 
to 17 5/8 as nearly 7.6 million shares changed hands. The company said an 
acceleration in its expansion program will cause its earnings to show no 
material growth in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best Buy, which competes with Circuit City, tumbled 7 1/2 to 39 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kmart, which previewed its mediocre results Wednesday in announcing plans to 
restructure, dropped 1 1/2 to 19 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Borden was down 1/2 to 15 3/8 on heavy NYSE volume of more than 4.6 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 * Texas Utilities fell 2 1/4 to 40 3/8 after it was downgraded to "under 
perform" from "neutral" by Kidder Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the Nasdaq, Copley Pharmaceutical was off 8 at 29 1/2. The drug company's 
stock tumbled after it gave an estimate of the financial impact from the 
voluntary recall of albuterol vials. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adobe Systems rose 4 to 26 1/2 after it approved the buyback of 2 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, stocks were mixed. Mexico City's Bolsa index closed at a new high in 
a volatile session aided by "buy" recommendations for Telefonos de Mexico and 
Vitro by U.S. analysts. The key index gained 26.86 points, or 1.01%, to end at 
2,684.17. 
</P>
<P>
 Markets moved ahead in London, Paris and Tokyo but fell in Frankfurt. Other 
Markets  
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the Treasury's main 30-year bond yield finished the day at 
6.34%, down from Wednesday's 6.40%. But shorter-term bond yields were down

<P>
 Reich's comments regarding the December jobs report surprised many economists 
who had forecast a big jump in employment. Many traders bought bonds on the 
remarks because they speculated that the head of the agency releasing the data 
may have had some inside knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentiment generated some bullishness ahead of Friday's data because slower 
growth generally means low inflation levels. Inflation can diminish the value 
of fixed-income investments such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market managed to hold on to its initial price gains that followed 
Reich's remarks. One reason was the subsequent release of weekly data on 
first-time unemployment claims. Elsewhere:

BEHIND THE WHEEL / PAUL DEAN: MUSCLE MEMORIES; CHEVY IMPALA SS IS A GHOST OF 
THE 'SO FINE' 409 THAT DROVE A GENERATION TO SING ITS PRAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year of public appearances to decide if it should live or molder in 
limbo, Chevrolet's black and beefy Impala SS will be at Saturday's opening of 
the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be its final coming-out as a concept car. 
</P>
<P>
 For interest has been high and 5,000 advance orders are on the books. The 
Impala SS goes into production in March and should be in showrooms a month 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 So, after 24 years in hibernation, a muscular subseries from the '60s returns 
to whatever demand exists for pumped up, powerhouse versions of full-size, 
blancmange American sedans. 
</P>
<P>
 The technical foundation in this case is Chevrolet's Caprice Classic, which is 
rotund, overfed and rides rather like a beach ball with corners. 
</P>
<P>
 But by lowering the silhouette a little and adding a frown to its front, by 
stiffening the suspension and installing a declawed Corvette engine, the 
Caprice becomes a Generation X Impala SS with much of the thunder and most of 
the ginger of the Super Sport heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Or have you forgotten the 1963 Impala SS 409 with a big-block V-8 belching 425 
horsepower and smoking hopes on a thousand Main streets? Or the last of the 
breed, the 1969 Impala SS with a 427-cid Mark IV engine, which was honorably 
dethroned by mid-size muscle and the first of the Camaros? 
</P>
<P>
 (Personal aside: In 1965, I traded a burgundy, four-speed, 1963 Impala 409 
convertible for $1,300 off the price of a new Alfa-Romeo Spyder. Two decades 
later, collector Reggie Jackson paid $93,000 for an identical 409. I displayed 
similar investment foresight with IBM, DeLorean and Lincoln Thrift.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although a warmer version at an estimated $23,000 will certainly perk 
Chevrolet's sluggish full-size sales -- Caprice was down to 88,000 cars last 
year from a 1984 peak of 258,902 -- the 1994 Impala simply isn't Super Sport 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
 The transmission is a four-speed automatic with a slender, milquetoast shifter 
on the steering column. Not good for shifting down on twisty bits. Unlike its 
coupe and convertible ancestors, today's Impala SS comes only as a sedan. 
</P>
<P>
 And the engine -- although inbred from the Corvette's venerable and ubiquitous 
300-horsepower LT1 -- has been detuned to 260 ponies. That is more power than 
the competition -- in this case, Ford's Crown Victoria and Mercury Marquis -- 
and a little less than a Lincoln Mark VIII. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Perkins, general manager of GM's Chevrolet Division, explains that the 
Super Sport is not being reissued as a hot rod. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the initial requests from focus groups and customer surveys were 
simply for any full-frame, rear-drive sedan with peppier performance, a 
sportier look and crisper handling. In other words, the kind of vehicle that 
the sloppy, 170-horsepower Caprice wasn't when redesigned for the 1992 model 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was the perfect opportunity to bring back the Impala SS name," Perkins 
says. "We've added the personality of a modern performance vehicle to the power 
of a great old name . . . and it's remarkable to find a car of this size that 
performs this well." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Perkins says he doesn't expect to be bowled over by initial Impala 
sales. Maybe less than 10,000 in 1994. And Ford sells that many Thunderbirds in 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In one regard, however, the Impala SS is already a crashing success. With the 
Super Sport package, the parent Caprice loses its Fatty Arbuckle look. 
</P>
<P>
 Although side cladding hasn't changed, the car is lower by 1 1/2 inches for a 
vast improvement in the silhouette. Fatter tires on 17-inch, five-spoke alloys 
better fill its large wheel wells. Body-colored moldings replace chromium 
strips -- always a highly visible accent -- which also aids the visual 
reduction of a bulging midsection. 
</P>
<P>
 The front end is sans brightwork with the Caprice's egg-crate grille now a 
slim opening divided by a single horizontal bar. Rear-quarter windows have been 
reshaped by inserts wearing the familiar leaping Impala logo. Chevrolet , the 
name, does not appear on the car. Just the Impala logo and black-on-black 
lettering that discreetly, almost invisibly spells out "Impala SS" on the rear 
quarter fenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect is very bad but discreet, handsome yet menacing -- and for this 
year of reintroduction, a look available only in Bible black. 
</P>
<P>
 Save minimal reconfiguring -- a leather-wrapped steering wheel, center console 
and a line of floor-mounted cup holes and assorted holders that could be 
plumbed into an interesting waterfall -- the interior is pretty much Caprice. 
</P>
<P>
 Two air bags are standard. So are anti-lock brakes, air conditioning and tilt 
steering wheel. But damn our eyes if the curse of a digital speedometer hasn't 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprice has wood accents. Impala has its interior surfaces finished in satin 
black. Caprice has routine chairs. Impala has some rather impressive, albeit 
broad buckets -- leather optional -- with integral headrests embroidered with 
the Impala logo. Very stylish. 
</P>
<P>
 But the side mirrors are a disaster. They are surprisingly small and allow 
little more than peep-show information: A hint of what might be without 
revealing everything, a fender bender waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Impala's handling is superior fringing on excellent and well up to newer, 
higher levels of, say, Cadillac's Seville STS and Chrysler's LHS. Wallow and 
float are there, but just a hint. This is, after all, a 4,200-pound car and 
there's little to completely dampen that much metal in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Power steering is well-balanced, consistent, informative and easy to hold on a 
line at middling to interesting speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The LT1 engine, of course, is a firecracker, which explains why GM seems ready 
to install it in everything except the Geo Metro. (Now there's an idea.) 
</P>
<P>
 With a whoosh and a snore from that cast-iron, friendly old V-8, it prances 
from rest to 60 m.p.h. in a smidge over seven seconds. There's power galore in 
mid-range acceleration and once unleashed, it allows that delightful mischief 
of punching around and ahead of fast-lane laggards and unsignaling wanderers 
who would cause us hurt and irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Perkins promises dressier Impalas in 1995 with dark green, 
burgundy and white added to the basic black. There will also be a floor-mounted 
shifter. 
</P>
<P>
 But, so far, no word of a manual transmission and a great, chrome, crook-neck 
Hurst shifter with a fat aluminum knob and a two-finger toggle for finding 
reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor any real chance of re-creating those hot nights on North Central slicing 
Phoenix, when some kid in a '49 Mercury pulled away from Jordan's Hacienda, 
slid his sneer down the side of my Impala SS and begged to lose his innocence.

NO LABELS, NO FRILLS, NO FUSS; 1994 LOOKS TO BE THE YEAR OF OUR DISCONTENT. THE 
TREND-WATCHERS SAY WE WILL SHY AWAY FROM HIGH-TICKET PICKS AND OPT INSTEAD TO 
DRESS DOWN. AND THE SEARCH IS ON FOR QUALITY, ACCESSORIES AND, NATURALLY, 
DEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bet you never thought you'd wear a gold ring through your navel, or platform 
basketball sneakers. Well, this could be the year. Such fashion novelties 
aside, '94 will be more about setting new ground rules than starting major 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
 People are letting it be known that they don't like the direction fashion is 
taking. Sheer dresses that look like nighties, waifish blouses that droop to 
the knee and clothes that endure slashing, scorching and shredding aren't what 
they expect of high-ticket items. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are so alienated when they see a model dressed in a designer-label 
suit with her bellybutton showing," snips Susan Roth of Trims Unlimited, a Los 
Angeles personal shopping firm. 
</P>
<P>
 So consumers -- men and women -- are taking matters into their own hands. 
They've started a movement of their own, and it's likely to be the year's 
strongest fashion theme: Dressing down is the new status dressing. For some, 
that will mean a wardrobe of athletic wear -- for evenings out as well as 
weekends. More often, it will translate into traditional versions of the most 
comfortable, relaxed clothing around. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts have been tracking the attitude behind the trend. After years of 
belt-tightening, people have adjusted to living with less. They're buying fewer 
things, choosing more carefully, and holding out for quality and comfort, says 
Barbara Kaplan of Westport, Conn.-based Yankelovich Partners Inc., which tracks 
lifestyle trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "People realize they don't need the conspicuous consumption of the '80s," she 
says. "And they're finding it's a wonderful relief." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the general distrust that people feel toward such institutions as 
politics and religion has seeped into the shopping arena. One hint of the new 
attitude has already surfaced. Unhappy mail-order customers returned 
considerably more of their purchases in 1993 than in recent years, says Katie 
Muldoon of Muldoon & Bear, catalogue consultants in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 And expectations will only get loftier, Kaplan says. "Consumers are saying, 
'I'm not going to let you get away with it.' They have become very 
unforgiving." 
</P>
<P>
 Discontented, yes. Ready to hang up the credit card? Never. The search for 
value will only help pump up the shopping gene. And the list of what to buy in 
'94 -- and where to buy it -- is as quirky as can be. 
</P>
<P>
 Early signs suggest that accessories will boom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our clientele bought very little in the way of outfits last year," Roth says. 
"We've done extremely well with items ." Cashmere sweaters, gorgeous shoes and 
alligator bags will be hot tickets among clientele accustomed to luxury goods. 
Even the wealthy are "taking what they already own and sprucing it up," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessories in all price ranges have been outselling apparel by 5% to 10%, 
says Karen Alberg, editor of Accessories, a Connecticut-based trade magazine. 
Hats and delicate items inspired by the early 1900s, as seen in the movie "The 
Age of Innocence," will be bestsellers, the magazine recently predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 In funkier circles, men and women will continue to put hoop earrings through 
pierced body parts -- especially the navel, once bikini season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Down-to-earth dressers will be stocking up on socks. Short, filmy versions 
with chunky platform sandals or dressier mules are a sure look for summer. The 
winter variation is thick, tweedy socks to wear instead of shoes around the 
house or in the office. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Crew homed in on the idea more than a year ago. Now it has trickled up. New 
York designer Carolyne Roehm wears bulky socks to work, along with jeans and a 
striped shirt, a recent article in Vogue says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the stylish will dress down, the trendy will dress waaaay down. Athletic 
wear will be the single trendiest item, replacing such grunge essentials as 
flannel shirts and cutoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 Ski suits, hiking boots, tennis skirts, jogging pants and firefighters' 
jackets (active wear of another sort) will mingle with tailored clothes in 
combinations for the office, evenings out and weekends. It's one step beyond 
last year's groundswell of dressing down on Friday. After four days of 
buttoning up, even corporate types slip into boots and jeans once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some New York designers got in on the idea, working active wear into their 
spring ready-to-wear collections. Isaac Mizrahi's pairing of striped sweat 
pants with blazers, Ralph Lauren's ski-patrol uniforms with leather boots, and 
Anna Sui's satin track suits for nightclubbing are just a few takes on the 
look. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Californians will probably look beyond the runway for athletic wear. 
Authentic items -- particularly Puma's striped basketball sneaker, "The Clyde" 
(after the nickname of '70s basketball star Walt Frazier) -- are musts. After 
Madonna wore her Clydes on a recent night out, the craze was off and running. 
</P>
<P>
 What will become of designer labels? With so many designers featuring bare 
bottoms, peek-a-boo boobs, exposed bellybuttons and clothes that career women 
cannot wear to work, fashion has joined the list of institutions people no 
longer trust. Winning back women's confidence will be the industry's toughest 
assignment this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, punk is one designer-driven look that stands a chance of 
catching on, particularly among teen-agers -- who missed its last go-round in 
the mid '70s. Safety-pins through the hems of short skirts and sweaters with 
embroidery-encircled burn holes seem downright wholesome next to some of the 
other designer offerings for '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic themes will also run through spring and summer designer wear; Southeast 
Asia and ancient Greece inspired collections by Jean Paul Gaultier, Ralph 
Lauren and Romeo Gigli. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what designers do, shoppers will always love bargains. "Power 
centers," malls that include a mix of such stores as Costco, Target, Price 
Club, TJ Maxx and Wal-Mart, are mall developers' current delight. California's 
list of 50 or so such centers is expected to grow this year, says Robert Kahn, 
a Lafayette, Calif.-based retail analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 He also predicts a good year for the Gap, which recently dropped prices on its 
basics to keep pace with competitors. The Limited will also be a retailer to 
watch. "They have been missing the styles for the past year, but they're out to 
get their fashion more in step," Kahn reports. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest news in stores will come from Beverly Hills, where Barneys New 
York is scheduled to open on Wilshire Boulevard in March. The retailer's star 
wobbled late last year amid newspaper reports of its late-payment practices. 
Even before that, industry watchers say, its image was shaky. "I get the 
impression they think they're smarter than everyone else," Kahn says. "Their 
publicity is running against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, any serious full-price shoppers out there will have to look and decide 
for themselves. "People are going to shop Barneys, as they did when we first 
came to town," predicts Richard Chilcott, regional manager for Nordstrom. Since 
the Seattle-based chain opened its first Southern California store in 1978, it 
has earned a reputation as a local leader. "Barneys' niche is better 
merchandise," Chilcott says. Nordstrom's strong pull, he adds, is impeccable 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like the beginning of what promises to be the best race in all of 
fashion this year

<P>
 Even as major players in the fashion industry were falling to their knees -- 
Anne Cole, Marc Jacobs, Adolfo, Bob Mackie and Carolyne Roehm -- scads of 
would-be Los Angeles designers blithely started their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful would survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "A successful business takes more than a dream and a sewing machine," says 
Alan Millstein, publisher of the New York City-based Fashion Network Report, a 
trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes money. 
</P>
<P>
 So accessory designer Carrie Forbes sold the ruby ring her grandmother left 
her to buy the leather for her first collection of handbags. 
</P>
<P>
 She and the other designers profiled here have managed to tread treacherous 
waters for the past few years in Los Angeles, where a shrinking number of 
stores have taken fewer risks on new talent. "The average fashion-design 
business lasts three years. If (one) lasts for five, it is considered a roaring 
success," says Millstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Norzagaray did time on a junior line called Jigsaw before his backers 
gave him the chance to create higher-priced women's clothes under his own 
label. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Barish toiled quietly for years in New York before moving home to Los 
Angeles and becoming "a 22-year overnight success," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lews, Michael and Doris, moved in with her grandmother when their 
fledgling menswear business sucked up every last penny. 
</P>
<P>
 Some day, their tales may eclipse the one about Calvin Klein. 
</P>
<P>
 According to fashion lore, Klein was making polyester clothes by day and 
designing his own line at night when he met a Bonwit Teller executive who 
encouraged him to make an appointment with the New York City retailer's fashion 
director. Rather than risk wrinkling his coats and dresses on the seat of a 
taxi, Klein pushed his garment rack, with a broken wheel, 20 blocks to the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few years, the telling will probably include three feet of snow on the 
sidewalks Klein traveled. That's the way humble-beginnings stories grow. A

 Carrie Forbes used to be a flak. In the late '80s, she was the 
public-relations professional behind Jerry Seinfeld. But she found her job at a 
Los Angeles P.R. firm wanting. "It wasn't very satisfying trying to catapult 
(clients) to stardom," she says. Had she hung around, Forbes might have enjoyed 
the rocket-ship ride with Seinfeld, but the L.A. native deplaned in 1989 to 
make silk scarves. Intending to begin her fashion career with a line of 
handbags ("I could never find one I really liked"), she says she lacked the 
know-how and the funds to buy leather in quantity. Forbes took the ruby ring 
her grandmother had left her to Christie's auction house. The $7,000 in 
proceeds allowed her to make the jump from regular paycheck to entrepreneur.  
</P>
<P>
 She made scarves and evening bags and, 18 months into her new career, had a 
hit with crocheted handbags. They were either teeny-tiny or satchel-size and 
sold at Barneys and Madeline Gallay. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Karan took a liking to Forbes' work and asked her to do handbags for her 
resort collection, now in stores. Forbes has since declined to work with other 
designers -- "even though the association gives cache," she says -- so she can 
focus on her own label. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought it would turn into a serious business," she says. "I just 
knew I didn't want to work for anyone else." 'It's My Only Passion'

</P>
<P>
 Daniel Norzagaray's first job after graduation in 1986 from the Fashion 
Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles was designing large-size 
T-shirts and maternity wear. Not exactly his dream job, but , he says, "I was 
one of the lucky ones. Most graduates don't get the opportunity to design for 
quite a while."  
</P>
<P>
 He inched up the design ladder, from maternity smocks to club clothes for 
juniors, "those tight Lycra dresses with doodads hanging off them. Well . . . 
they were popular once," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Norzagaray wanted to do a line of contemporary women's clothing and, after a 
year of designing Jigsaw, a dressy junior line, he was rewarded. His backers, 
Chyan Inc. owners Jim Sauer and Marlen Horn, let him loose. His first efforts 
were picked up by Barneys and Henri Bendel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take the Euro look and translate it for a more American type of retailer. 
It's simplified. I see Karl (Lagerfeld) doing softer dressing with clean and 
simple lines and I do the same, but I drop the corselets. Americans don't want 
or understand corselets," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old Los Angeles native is fairly obsessed with fashion. "It's my 
only passion; it's all I think about," he says. "I've even followed women in 
restaurants as they've walked to the bathroom, just to check out their 
hemline." 'I'm the Rock 'n' Roll Chanel'

<P>
 Pamela Barish would prefer to hide behind the skirts of her creations and let 
her clothes to do her talking. 
</P>
<P>
 The painfully shy designer was pressed into professional service when her 
friends wanted clothes like the ones she sewed for herself. The friends told 
other friends and before long, Barish was making velvet dresses for the 
Hollywood fashion circle. Rosanna Arquette, a longtime fan of Barish's romantic 
dresses with brocade bodices, had the designer stitch wedding garments for her 
and groom-to-be Jon Sidel. Laura Dern, Jennifer Grey and Anjelica Huston are 
also customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The supermarket tabloids have fed a bulging scrapbook of shots of her dresses 
on women attending movie premieres and parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the rock 'n' roll Chanel," Barish says. 
</P>
<P>
 The private sales funded her first collection, earning rack space at Maxfield 
and I. Magnin in the summer of '92.  
</P>
<P>
 Barish plans to keep her list of celebrity couture clients, add a few more 
stores and keep the business small. "That way I can keep my eye on the 
quality," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has bad news for the celebs who keep asking for velvets: She's 
finished with that fabric. "I've been doing that for two seasons; it's time to 
move on." Next: "A combination of peasant and Zen-type looks. It's rich, 
opulent and raw." 'Now Things Are Phenomenal'

 Los Angeles native Michael Lew risked alienating his family to become a 
designer. He secretly changed colleges, giving up agriculture and business 
classes at UC Davis for the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in 
San Francisco. When his parents caught on, they weren't pleased, Lew recalls. 
But they came around about the time he won an FIDM contest to design 
over-the-top evening dresses for TV's "Dynasty."  
</P>
<P>
 Lew met his future wife and business partner, Doris, in school in the 
mid-'80s, but they didn't marry until 1990. (One of those 
boy-meets-girl-but-doesn't-marry-her-until-he-sees-her-merchandising-and-production-skills 
sort of stories.) 
</P>
<P>
 By then, he was designing his own line of menswear -- unconstructed jackets 
with patch pockets, lace-up shirts and plaid vests of lightweight cotton. The 
couple added a women's line of long tube dresses, skinny knit skirts and 
cropped cardigans. Both collections, under the Imaginary Concept label, began 
to sell, but it took every cent the Lews had to fill orders. That's when they 
moved in with Doris' grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when things looked the bleakest, financial backers came calling. Then, in 
November, Michael was nominated for a Rising Star award by the California Mart 
for his menswear.  
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we gave up everything," says Michael. "Now things are phenomenal."

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: THOSE NOT WITH IT, LISTEN UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sure, we could bore you with our own New Year's fashion resolutions (like, no 
more bell-bottoms ever ). But we've resolved to stop beating ourself up in '94. 
So let's bag on everyone else. Ready? 
</P>
<P>
 * Less flesh, please. Is the world really a better place now that Elle 
Macpherson's diamond-necklace-draped butt has been immortalized on the pages of 
the British Tatler? We think not. (Besides, what about her mind?) Other 
offenders in the year's endless skin parade: Tupac Shakur, Andre Agassi, Kate 
Moss, Fabio and teeny, out-of-favor boy-toy Marky Mark. Put a shirt on it, 
darlings. Preferably something sheer and wrinkled. 
</P>
<P>
 * No, no nose clips. These decorative devices favored by designer Jean Paul 
Gaultier create a tiny trail from nostril to earlobe (and sometimes to doggie 
collar). They make plain old piercings look quite wholesome. 
</P>
<P>
 * New pants for Howard Stern. We like the hair, the glasses, the Paul Revere 
and the Raiders-style frock coat. But those stovepipe jeans have got to go, Mr. 
Millionaire. Your private parts deserve better. (Hint: Check out that other 
hunky giant and fashion plate, Jeff Goldblum.) 
</P>
<P>
 * A fuller crown for Hillary. The First Lady's latest do makes her look like a 
flat head. Sans bangs and a thick velvet headband, that high Rodham forehead 
levels off alarmingly quickly. Hence the adage: A bargain haircut is worth the 
price. Why suffer when Cristophe could be there in a flash on Air Force One? 
</P>
<P>
 Credit Where Credit's Deserved: Can the multitalented, multi-hyphenated Barbra 
Streisand now add the title couturier to her resume? Well, yes and no. 
According to Streisand's publicist, Michael Levine, the off-the-shoulder gowns 
worn by the singer during her New Year's soiree in Las Vegas were designed by 
Streisand and "executed" by longtime chum Donna Karan. One of the world's top 
designers reduced to a seamstress? Karan spokeswoman Patty Cohen put a 
different spin on it: "The dresses were a collaboration," she said. "Barbra and 
Donna considered it a collaboration." 
</P>
<P>
 Window Shopping: Not everyone appreciated the Menendez brothers window at the 
new West Hollywood menswear boutique JonValdi. "This is the most awful thing 
I've ever seen," one man told the store's co-owner, Jonathan Meizler. "I'll 
never shop here." But a crew from the ABC newsmagazine "PrimeTime Live" found 
the window's macabre text, reading "The Menendez brothers did not buy their 
guns here. But they did walk away with a shirt and a tie," worth filming for a 
recent piece on the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Meizler and his partner, German Valdivia, have sold their "progressively 
classic" designs at Fred Segal for three years; their Melrose Avenue boutique 
opened in September. Their clientele, so far, includes Robert Downey Jr., 
Arsenio Hall and the stars of "In Living Color," "Fresh Prince" and "Beverly 
Hills, 90210." "The difference between a power suit and our suit," Meizler 
explains, "is that the man makes the clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Gala Girl: There's Military Barbie, Gibson Girl Barbie, Chinese Barbie and, 
coming to the small screen soon, Infomercial Barbie. What other doll adapts 
beautifully to any era, any culture and navigates the information superhighway 
with aplomb? Mighty Morphin Power Rangers? Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosting Barbie's first TV show is actress Pam Dawber, who has lots of 
experience playing sidekick to unearthly beings. "The whole idea is to expand 
the scope of Barbie collectors," says Lisa McKendall, Mattel Toys marketing 
communications manager. "There are some people who don't know about our 
collection." Can you imagine? 
</P>
<P>
 Benefit Ball Barbie, Opening Night Barbie and Evening Extravaganza Barbie, $50 
each, all dress for their respective events in over-the-top gowns that scream 
conspicuous consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 What'd you expect -- Hair Shirt Barbie? 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Children's Playthings That Hold Inexplicable Allure for So-Called 
Adults: It seems that Mickey Mouse and the rest of his Disney pals -- once so 
popular in France -- have been replaced in the hearts and on the backs of the 
Paris middle class by an obscure Hanna-Barbera character named Droopy Dog. "The 
fashion allure of Disney was lost when it became just another Metro stop," 
notes one American abroad. "France is having a love affair with Droopy Dog." 
Way chic, she says, is a Droopy Dog pajama shirt and D.D. slippers. We'll take 
her word. 
</P>
<P>
 Working for Scale: We couldn't wait to see how the 
once-svelte-news-anchor-turned-unabashed-pudgy Kathleen Sullivan did on her 
first week of Weight Watchers. On New Year's Day, you'll recall, the formerly 
kittenish broadcaster announced on a TV commercial that she was starting the 
weight-loss program. "We're in this together," she said sympathetically. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Wednesday night, while Sullivan wasn't looking (or so we thought), we 
ate a tub of Poppycock and watched a repeat of "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation." Surprise! Sullivan appeared in Commercial No. 2. Dressed in a 
mannish pin-striped shirt, Sullivan weighed in. She had lost five pounds -- or 
so she said. Stay tuned.

THERE'S 'CLEAR, PRESENT DANGER' AT JOHN WAYNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor Harrison Ford was stalked by an assassin Thursday night at John Wayne 
Airport before dozens of onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
 As he picked up his luggage from the carousel in the baggage claim area, a 
steely, gun-wielding CIA operative watched his every move from the level above 
and seemed ready to strike at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
 But rest easy. Ford was reprising his role as CIA analyst Jack Ryan, and 
Willem Dafoe was the would-be assassin for the upcoming movie "Clear and 
Present Danger" based on the thriller by Tom Clancy. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wayne Airport was transformed into Bogota's El Dorado International 
Airport for the filming. At the top of the elevators, a sign read, "Bienvenidos 
a Bogota!" and an ice cream stand became " refrescos " and a newsstand became " 
periodicos y revistas ." 
</P>
<P>
 Bewildered travelers stepped off flights from throughout the country and took 
a double-take upon arrival. Signs set up by Paramount Pictures advised 
travelers that the movie was being filmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here today were actually upset because they thought they had landed in 
Bogota," said Phillip Noyce, the film's director. "Here they thought they were 
going to land in Orange County and they see this." 
</P>
<P>
 Clancy's book is about a secret invasion of Colombia by elite U.S. troops and 
the murders of the American ambassador to Colombia and the director of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, as Ryan, investigates the murders and discovers shocking links to a 
Colombian drug cartel. The book has parallels to the Iran-Contra scandal, as 
covert operations are launched without notification of Congress. Dafoe is the 
shadowy CIA operative. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting for the film, which is due in theaters this summer, is to conclude 
tonight at John Wayne Airport, and has already taken place at the Los Alamitos 
Armed Forces Reserve Center and Los Angeles International Airport. After 
tonight's filming, the crew and cast head to Washington, and then on to Mexico 
for the rest of January and February. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's publicist, Don Levy, declined to say exactly what scenes are to be 
shot at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't go into too much detail because the scenes kind of form a key plot 
point, and I wouldn't want to spoil the fun," he said. "It's safe to say, 
however, that the scenes will involve Harrison Ford arriving in Bogota, 
Colombia." 
</P>
<P>
 While officials at John Wayne Airport have told the production crews that they 
cannot close off any portion of the airport, they have recommended that scenes 
be shot after 11 p.m. after the last flight arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at 7 p.m. Thursday, the airport was practically deserted as Ford, Dafoe 
and Noyce walked through the scenes that were to be shot throughout the night 
and until about 5 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Airport spokeswoman Courtney C. Wiercioch said the production company 
approached county officials several weeks ago about shooting scenes on both 
levels of John Wayne Airport, including the baggage claim area. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiercioch said the airport is being requested more and more often as a filming 
location and, recently, CBS inquired about using John Wayne Airport for a 
proposed miniseries on the trial of Lyle and Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicists for "Clear and Present Danger" stressed that access to the set is 
restricted, and most of the filming will take place late at night into early 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all-night shooting," Levy said. "When you are shooting in an airport or 
busy place, the fewer people the better. We have all the background extras we 
need. Our major concern is that we not attract an unnecessary crowd."

DANA PARSONS: FAILED RESTAURANT'S DOWNFALL: LOCALE IS BEHIND ITS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The downfall of Kam Yee's restaurant on Santa Ana's East 17th Street is now 
complete. You can kiss the Texas Cantina goodby. A couple weeks ago, after more 
than a year of sputtering starts and wheezing revenue, Yee surrendered his 
license to do business and walked away. If he'd had a white flag, he would have 
waved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yee won't even merit a footnote in local business history, but he probably 
should. When someone looks back on the modern era in search of reasons why 
small business was in such trouble, Yee's unassuming restaurant would provide 
an ample reference point. 
</P>
<P>
 At this stage of the game -- with Yee saying he and his partners are down 
$200,000 -- there are recriminations all around on Yee's part. 
</P>
<P>
 The city did him in. 
</P>
<P>
 The state liquor licensers did him in. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors did him in. 
</P>
<P>
 But as I speculated when I first met Yee a year ago, the real culprit is much 
more insidious than any of the above. Although he didn't know it, his effort 
was probably doomed from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time along that stretch of East 17th Street, a restaurant that 
featured music, drinks and dinner would have made it. Indeed, Yee had once 
operated a restaurant there, featuring Chinese food, but that was years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 His mistake was thinking he could re-create the 1970s in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Yee sold the property. The new owners succeeded only in angering some 
of the surrounding neighbors and in getting shut down after investigators 
discovered that cocaine was sold on the premises. In addition, neighbors 
complained about late-night noise and disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Yee re-entered the picture and reapplied for a license in January 
of 1992, the stigma concerning the site was indelibly etched. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the city and the state heard from the public as soon as Yee applied for a 
license. Among the appeasement plans suggested was one that called for Yee to 
close by 9 p.m., have security guards in the parking lot and have no live 
entertainment. Yee succeeded in getting his closing time moved back to 11 p.m., 
but not to the 1:30 a.m. or 2 a.m. he preferred to maintain the late-night 
business he thought he needed to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened in November of 1992 but didn't get his liquor license until the 
following February, he said. In the meantime, customers came and went, 
frustrated over not having liquor available to eat with the ribs and Mexican 
food that dominated the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we got the license, business was good for about a month," Yee said. 
"But after that, people learned we didn't have much of anything, no live 
entertainment, anything. And when we told them we closed at 11, our banquet 
business dropped off. So, it was pretty tough. People come in late, they don't 
work 8 to 5 anymore. The whole dining scene is completely different. So you 
have to be open longer to get what you can. But the city wouldn't let us do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The city and state were responding to some neighbor complaints stemming from 
the previous owners. "We look at the track record of a particular location, and 
when residents say, 'We've had it up to here and please don't let them do it 
again,' we listen to that," said Dale Rasmussen, administrator for the state 
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. 
</P>
<P>
 Rasmussen says his office made a sincere effort at compromise in Yee's 
situation, rather than simply deny his liquor license application. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing that bothers me tremendously," Yee said, "is why the 
neighborhood has so much voice to control my fate. They said they were 
traumatized (by the former management's record). What about my partner? He lost 
all his money. What about the restaurant closing and 10 people who are losing 
their jobs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Bain is an insurance broker with an office next door to Yee's ill-fated 
restaurant. "I remember what was going on before (Yee took over), and they were 
having problems there," Bain said this week. "It was getting pretty shoddy and 
they weren't taking care of the premises. Then he came in and upgraded 
everything, and I felt it was an improvement to the neighborhood. You didn't 
see anyone wandering around back there (behind the restaurant), because he was 
taking care of it and he did upgrade the parking area." 
</P>
<P>
 Bain thinks Yee is on the wrong side of history right now. "The area we're in 
here, it's very difficult to attract steady customers because we don't have the 
commerce here. The only way to make a go is if you were somewhere else and you 
had a following that came with you. I think where he's located, I just don't 
think it's a good location. I just don't think people are coming to this area 
right now. It's just not an area you come to at night." 
</P>
<P>
 What he's saying is that in another time, another place -- such as the way Yee 
remembers the area being 20 years ago -- a new restaurant might have made it. 
Live music and beer until 1 a.m. wouldn't have automatically translated into 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kam Yee has discovered, that combination today along East 17th Street is 
just a welcome mat for another empty storefront.

AN ATTORNEY TAKES OFFICE; NEW CHIEF WANTS BIGGER ROLE FOR U.S. PROSECUTORS IN 
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gaudy brass lettering that spells out the name of her predecessor still 
looms large on the wall outside the U.S. attorney's office here, but Jean A. 
Kawahara is firmly entrenched in the office he vacated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The shelves beside her desk are packed with 26 volumes of "U.S. v. Andonian," 
the case that consumed three years of Kawahara's life and became one of the 
nation's biggest money-laundering prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 people have been convicted as a result of Operation Polar Cap, 
the investigation that spawned the case and which centered on the downtown Los 
Angeles jewelry district. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawers of Kawahara's filing cabinets are stuffed with bank fraud and 
other criminal cases, past and present. And to give the office a somewhat 
personal touch, there are several nearby pieces of art, including a Norman 
Parkinson photograph and a Malaysian puppet. 
</P>
<P>
 After less than six years as an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, 
Kawahara was recently named chief of the Santa Ana branch office by Nora M. 
Manella, the newly appointed U.S. attorney who heads the Los Angeles-based 
federal district that spans seven Southern California counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawahara replaces Paul Seave, the popular prosecutor who left after four years 
to become second in command for the U.S. attorney's office in Sacramento. Like 
Seave, Kawahara has experience in handling fraud and embezzlement cases, useful 
in a county that some wags have dubbed the Cote de Fraud . 
</P>
<P>
 With the appointment, Kawahara becomes the highest ranking Asian American in 
the U.S. attorney's Los Angeles office and, at 33, one of the youngest 
supervisors in a field of nearly 200 attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly feel lucky to be in this position, because it's a tremendous 
one," she said. "I've worked on terrific cases with terrific people. Good 
opportunities have come my way and this is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Los Angeles, Kawahara spent the first eight years of her life in 
Gardena before her family moved to Palos Verdes, where she attended high 
school. She graduated from Brown University and got her law degree from UC 
Berkeley. After 2 1/2 years in private practice, where she specialized in 
business litigation, she was hired into the U.S. attorney's office in Los 
Angeles in early 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, she was pulled into the jewelry mart case, a complicated 
investigation that law enforcement officials say spanned four years of illegal 
activity by jewelry companies and involved the laundering of some $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawahara was the junior prosecutor in the first phase of the trial, which 
ended with the convictions of five defendants and guilty pleas by three others. 
But charges against four defendants were dismissed, and four others were 
acquitted, fueling criticism that the government had overcharged the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Ho, an attorney who represented a Lebanese immigrant held without bail 
for 22 months before being acquitted, was highly critical of the government's 
case but does not hold Kawahara responsible for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always felt the government was overzealous in prosecuting the case but 
I'm not sure that she was in total control of the case," Ho said. "She was a 
straight-shooter and did her best. She was always prepared and on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 A small gesture that has always stuck with Ho was Kawahara's acceptance of the 
cookies that Ho brings to every trial. Some prosecutors, she said, absolutely 
refuse to share in the treat, believing that it will somehow compromise their 
objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my book, there are prosecutors and there are human beings," Ho said. "Jean 
is a human being. She can treat your client as a person even if she has strong 
evidence against your client. And she always maintained her demeanor. There 
were times when you could tell she had one hour of sleep but she was always 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Ho said she did not feel the same way about Kawahara's fellow prosecutor in 
the case, Russell Hayman, and declined to comment about his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawahara remembers the case as all-consuming. And while she learned a great 
deal about legal issues, investigative procedures and other experiences, she 
rarely had a weekend off in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 With the verdicts reached in the jewelry mart cases in January, 1991, Kawahara 
was off to the major fraud unit to grapple with yet more cases of white-collar 
crime. She had three trials that year, but in December she was brought into the 
case of Newport Beach investment adviser Steven D. Wymer, who was arrested on 
federal fraud charges in connection with the disappearance of $100 million of 
his clients' money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For most of 1992, Kawahara said, she and other prosecutors tried to unravel a 
thicket of investments that governments, like the cities of Orange and 
Torrance, thought they had made in investment grade securities through Wymer's 
financial management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors showed that much of the money was diverted to finance Wymer's 
lavish lifestyle and purchase property, luxury automobiles, boats and fine art. 
Some cities, like Orange, claimed to have lost millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 With the case set for trial, Wymer's attorney struck a deal with prosecutors 
in September, 1992. Wymer pleaded guilty to nine federal charges of 
racketeering, stock fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud and obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors asked that he be sentenced to 15 to 20 years in prison. Wymer 
asked for less than 10 years. He was sentenced to 14 1/2 years and agreed to 
cooperate with authorities in trying to regain some of the missing money. So 
far, only about $10 million has been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was difficult to sort through the web of securities transactions 
in trying to track the missing $100 million, Kawahara said prosecuting the case 
was not that hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case was really overwhelming," she said. "It was so easy to see that if 
someone says you were supposed to have a lot of money and you don't have any of 
it, while (Wymer) could come up with some excuses, the bottom line is the 
bottom line. The best he could do for himself was plead guilty and try to 
assist the government and the victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Wymer's defense attorney, James D. Riddet of Santa Ana, said he was saddened 
to see Seave leave the local U.S. attorney's office but was pleased to hear 
that Kawahara was replacing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a high regard for her ability," he said. "She's smart and fair. She's 
reasonable. I would say she's not particularly aggressive, but I put a bad 
connotation on aggressive. She obeys the rules and still represents the 
government's interests very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Some defense attorneys say Kawahara can be impersonal, distant and somewhat 
inflexible when it comes to making deals, but they also say she is highly 
ethical and well versed in the law, and is an exhaustive researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing U.S. Atty. Terree A. Bowers calls her "exceptionally bright and a 
hard worker with superlative people skills." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With experience on several large investigations and with experience in 
white-collar prosecutions, Bowers said Kawahara is ready to head the 11-person 
office in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has extensive experience in the Los Angeles office and has terrific 
potential," he said. "You tend to get a lot of experience in a short period of 
time in the L.A. office." 
</P>
<P>
 Spending as many hours in the office as she does, Kawahara met her husband on 
the job. In May, she married Dean G. Dunlavey, deputy chief of the narcotics 
section in the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a registered Democrat. He is a registered Republican. So when it comes 
to some issues, such as paying taxes for social services, the pair part 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our party registration alone is an indication that we don't agree on 
everything, but our fundamental approach to the job is similar," she said. 
"It's safe to say, however, that during the presidential election, we each 
voted the party line." 
</P>
<P>
 Kawahara comes from a financial family. Her father is Herbert G. Kawahara, a 
former president of the Pacific Stock Exchange and once the top executive in 
Southern California for E.F. Hutton. Her older sister was an investment banker 
and her younger brother is a stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first concern in the Santa Ana office has been to get more attorneys. In 
her office, which handles federal prosecutions from San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties as well, attorneys are required to file cases based on the 
number of judges in the local U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are required to handle twice as many cases per assistant (U.S. attorney) 
as in L.A.," she said. "As a consequence, the cases we would like to handle 
down here get handled by the L.A. office. What I would like to see is us 
handling cases in Orange County that happen in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she will be hampered by a current hiring freeze and a mandate by the 
Clinton Administration to downsize the government, Kawahara said the need is 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the amount of crime that occurs down here, we just need more help," she 
said. "Part of it is logistics, making it easier for agents and witnesses, but 
more importantly, this is an important metropolitan center separate and 
distinct from Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Being head of the Santa Ana office, which is only 6 years old, is a unique 
opportunity to shape strategies for prosecuting all kinds of crime, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the opportunity to build an office rather than just being part of what 
is already a tremendous office," she said. "Our presence . . . ought to be 
greater than it is now. There are certainly as many cases generated out of this 
area as can be handled here and we ought to be more sensitive to what is 
happening here." Jean A. Kawahara New job: Chief of the Santa Ana branch of the 
U.S. attorney's office Age: 33 Major prosecutions: Operation Polar Cap, which 
involved money laundering in downtown Los Angeles jewelry district; Steven D. 
Wymer, the Newport Beach investment adviser sentenced to 14 1/2 years in prison

STUDENT'S TIP LED TO ARREST OF UCI OFFICER; CRIME: HIS OBSERVATION OF MISSING 
LABEL ON ROOMMATE'S BORROWED COMPUTER ULTIMATELY POINTED INVESTIGATORS TO 
SUSPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A student at Cal State Fullerton, who grew suspicious of a computer his 
roommate brought home from work, triggered the investigation that ultimately 
led authorities to a UC Irvine police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities this week announced that former officer Scott Eric Roberts, 34, 
faces 17 felony charges that he stole computers and other high-tech equipment 
from buildings on the Irvine campus over a period of three years, authorities 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified student, who recently graduated, was working as a computer 
programmer at the Cal State Fullerton Police Department when his roommate came 
home with a computer he had borrowed from work, said William Huffman, director 
of public safety for the campus. The student noticed that the computer was 
similar to those used at Cal State Fullerton and even had a sticky surface in 
the exact location where the university places identification numbers on its 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was obvious that a label had been peeled off and that's what piqued his 
curiosity," Huffman said. "He was thinking that it was probably one of our 
computers." 
</P>
<P>
 The student asked the campus police to run a check on it.  
</P>
<P>
 The check revealed that the computer had been stolen from UC Irvine, and 
police traced it to a person who said he had bought it from Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fluke," Huffman said of the 22-year-old student's role in the chain 
of events. "I think working here taught him to be a little more suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
 The student could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Randy Pawloski confirmed that the student's 
actions were "basically what got the ball rolling. That's what started the 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, who joined the UC Irvine Police Department in 1984, was fired on Dec. 
20 because of the criminal investigation. He faces theft charges that date back 
to 1991, when a cellular telephone was reported stolen from a student residence 
hall during winter vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years since, Pawloski said, Roberts is suspected of stealing a 
variety of computer parts, portable radios, stereo speakers, videocassette 
recorders and an electric typewriter from classrooms and administrative 
buildings around the campus, Pawloski said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is suspected of selling some of the equipment on at least five 
occasions to various people, Pawloski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may or may not have been working alone," Pawloski said. "The investigation 
is ongoing so we may have additional counts if more victims come forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, a Trabuco Canyon resident, has until today to post $10,000 bail or 
surrender at the Orange County Jail. Defense attorney John Barnett has said 
Roberts will post bail and plead not guilty to all the charges when he is 
arraigned Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, UCI's Police Department is still reeling and grappling with how to 
regain campus trust, Police Chief Kathy Stanley said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is amazed," Stanley said. "It's a very close community. This is 
an officer who shared meals with students and staff members. It's amazing that 
something like this could be going on. We had such trust. It's just made 
everyone sick." 
</P>
<P>
 James Craig, assistant vice chancellor of student affairs, said: "Something 
like this is a shock. We're shocked and concerned. But my sense is that people 
will not judge the department on one person, however this case turns out." 
</P>
<P>
 DeWayne Green, administrative officer for the the university's computer 
science department, expressed relief that authorities have a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disturbing but, unfortunately, these things happen in any organization," 
Green said. "The most important thing is that when it was brought to the 
attention of authorities, they jumped right on it and didn't let it slide." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts could face up to 11 years in state prison if convicted.

CITIES MOBILIZE AGAINST EL TORO PLANNING BOARD; BASE CONVERSION: ELEVEN NORTH 
COUNTY MUNICIPALITIES WILL TRY TO BLOCK FORMATION OF 9-MEMBER AGENCY APPROVED 
IN DECEMBER, WHICH THEY SAY IS NOT BROAD-BASED. THEY WILL LOBBY SUPERVISORS, 
THE PENTAGON. 
</P>

<P>
 Worried that they will have little say in deciding future uses of the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station, officials of 11 North County cities Thursday decided 
to try to block the formation of the base planning agency accepted last month 
by the County Board of Supervisors and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the supervisors unanimously approved creation of the agency in 
December, which would make a renewed attempt to change the agency's makeup seem 
futile, the city officials at Thursday's meeting said they continued to doubt 
that the county's agreement with Irvine is a "done deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Mayor Clarence J. Turner, explaining what he said was an urgent 
need for the cities to lobby for a broader-based agency board, said, "The more 
you sit back, the farther the train gets down the track, and the harder it is 
to stop. If we (are) . . . kind of going along and saying we are going to trust 
that decision-making body, we are going to make a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 The governing board of the planning agency tentatively approved by the 
supervisors and Irvine last month would have nine board members -- all five 
supervisors, three Irvine City Council members, and one from Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The North County city officials who formally came out in opposition to the 
fledgling agency Thursday believe the makeup of the board is biased against 
development of a commercial airport at 4,700-acre base. 
</P>
<P>
 They agreed to seek formal resolutions from their city councils opposing the 
agency's makeup that they would send to the Board of Supervisors, as well as to 
the Defense Department to show that the proposal lacks the broad-based 
community support that the federal government requires. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we put pressure on (the supervisors), they are going to sit up and take 
notice. They just cannot keep doing what they want to do," said Anaheim 
Councilman Irv Pickler. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach Councilman Frank Laszlo warned that this may be the county's last 
chance to get another airport. "If we let this one go, you are not going to get 
(an airport) anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The group attending the strategy meeting at Garden Grove City Hall was a 
subset of the 17 cities, representing almost 70% of the county's population, 
that favors another governing board proposal: an 11-member decision-making 
board made up of the supervisors, one city official from each of the five 
supervisorial districts, and a representative from Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Two business and community groups favoring conversion of El Toro to a 
commercial airport also attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Lichman of the Newport Beach-based Airport Working Group, said the 
organizations would unveil in two weeks their planned petition drive to place 
the El Toro issue on the November ballot. Lichman would not say what voters 
would be asked to decide, saying the issue is still under legal review. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene H. Moriarty, chairman of the Committee For El Toro Airport Tomorrow, 
added that the countywide ballot initiative "is kind of in the wings, as we say 
in show business." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Tanney, the county registrar of voters, said the signatures of 66,703 
registered voters must be submitted to the county by June 1 to place an item on 
the ballot. The petition gatherers have until March 11 to notify the county of 
their intent to collect signatures, Tanney said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Mayor Michael Ward and Councilman Barry J. Hammond, who negotiated the 
agreement with the county, questioned the motives of the North County city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their whole purpose is to have an airport and . . . to share in the revenues 
of an airport," Ward said. "And they are calling us unfair because they think 
we are against an airport?" 
</P>
<P>
 Added Hammond: "It's nothing more than their attempt to keep the issue alive 
in the media. . . . I don't think there's a high probability of (the plan) 
changing." 
</P>
<P>
 But still unresolved is Irvine's demand that in exchange for accepting the 
county-proposed agency, the county must begin "serious discussions" on Irvine's 
proposed annexation of the base. And Lake Forest, which was left out of the 
final negotiations, has not committed to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's probably trouble in paradise," Anaheim Assistant City Manager 
David Morgan told the North County officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is there total agreement among North County cities over how to proceed 
should the county-Irvine plan become a reality -- whether to submit a rival 
redevelopment proposal to the Defense Department, or "watchdog" the county 
agency that was to hold its first meeting sometime this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Councilman Mark Leyes, who chairs the Orange County Regional 
Airport Authority, argued for a cohesive strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fighting a war with one soldier at a time. If we all would make the 
assault at once, then we would seem to stand a better chance" of influencing 
the outcome, Leyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler suggested that the three-city airport authority could pick up more 
members if it changed its name from the Orange County Regional Airport 
Authority to the El Toro Conversion Authority, reflecting a willingness to 
objectively consider all redevelopment options.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; PROPOSAL TO EXPAND CLASSES FOR INMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Department officials are proposing an $111,532 
expansion of inmate education programs in the county's four jails. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which will come before the County Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday, would add Spanish-language substance abuse classes and some basic 
adult education courses to the voluntary classes already available in the 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing class offerings, such as job development and English as a second 
language, would also be expanded by the plan to increase jailhouse instructor 
staffing from 20 to 28 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a critical need for jail space, as everyone knows, and the goal here 
is to attack the problem from both sides," Assistant Sheriff Jerry Krans said. 
"If we can bridge problems such as illiteracy and lack of job skills, maybe we 
can prevent some of these people from making a return trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to rehabilitate and, in some instances, habilitate these people," 
Krans said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's first-year cost would be completely covered by profits made at 
jail commissaries, Krans said. The program would become eligible in its second 
year for state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would use our funds as seed money to help start the program up, then the 
state funds would kick in from there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago Community College instructors have been teaching in the four 
jails for several years, a program that is also subsidized by commissary 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 But state funding caps on institutional teaching hours by any single college 
have limited the number and sizes of classes, corrections programming 
supervisor Mercedes Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new package of courses would be taught by Orange County Department of 
Education instructors, allowing officials to tap into separate funding sources, 
Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion would allow jail officials to add classes to complement the 
current offerings that allow inmates to work toward a high school equivalency 
degree. It would also decrease the size of some classes, creating more 
individual attention, Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
 An adult basic education class for prisoners with reading levels below eighth 
grade and a "refresher" class for high school degree holders would be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Jail's vocational program, which already includes courses on 
landscaping, welding, sewing, furniture repair and other skills, would also be 
expanded. A computer-assisted drafting class would be added, possibly paving 
the way for other computer-oriented courses in the future, Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jail officials say there is a consistent waiting list for many of the classes, 
in particular life skills, family skills and substance abuse. Krans said the 
need for the literacy classes is made clear by results from a 1993 survey that 
showed 80% of inmates had reading and writing difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 County reports prepared last July show that since 1990, the education program 
has annually handled "well over 1,000" inmates, a total matched by the 
vocational program. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes from the two programs annually total about 230,000 student 
hours.GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; COUNCIL TELLS FIRM TO REMOVE BILLBOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A billboard installed by 3M National Advertising Co. on Nisson Road violates 
city code and has to be taken down, the City Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously earlier this week to deny the company's request 
for the billboard to stay at least four more months or until after the company 
has worked out an agreement with the California Department of Transportation to 
relocate it. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for 3M National Advertising said the company is asking Caltrans to 
pay for the relocation of the billboard, which has been affected by the 
widening of Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're simply asking for a reasonable time . . . not to exceed four months, so 
we can receive compensation," attorney Gary S. Mobley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the council's rejection of the appeal, the company has until 5 p.m. 
Monday to obtain a permit to dismantle the billboard, according to Rick Brown 
of the city's Buildings Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have exhausted their remedies with the city," Brown said. "They can take 
the city to court, but as far as the city process (is concerned), they have 
exhausted all appeals." 
</P>
<P>
 Mobley, who will confer with his client to see what to do next, said the 
advertising company will probably comply with the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway billboard issue has dragged on for several months as the company 
tried to fight an order by the city's Community Development Department to 
dismantle it. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboard at 1782 Nisson Road, close to the Interstate 5 off-ramp at Red 
Hill Avenue, was originally deemed a nonconforming billboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Under city code, outdoor advertising structures and billboards are prohibited, 
although a nonconforming billboard may be allowed as long as no changes or 
alterations are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that a work crew hired by the advertising company altered the sign 
in August, 1993, without seeking a city permit. 
</P>
<P>
 City building officials ordered the advertising company to dismantle the 
billboard, including its foundation and electrical system. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertising company appealed to the Building Board of Appeals, a citizen 
panel that hears complaints related to city code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a public hearing on Oct. 25, the panel ruled that the billboard must 
be taken down because it was built without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted the advertising company to bring the matter to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 If the company fails to take action to dismantle the billboard by Monday, 
Brown said, the city may have to remove the sign and bill the company for the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city may also go to court to force the advertising company to take 
down the billboard. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; EXHIBIT DEPICTS WOMEN IN REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clutching a rifle in one hand and with a pistol strapped to her waist, a 
Latina stares into space, frozen in time, with a look of grim determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Captured on film circa 1910, she wears a black dress ill-suited to combat but 
is ready to fight as a soldier in the Mexican Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Her black-and-white image is one of 52 photographs in a historical exhibit 
that opened Thursday at the Main Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Mexican government, the photo display highlights the role of 
women in the revolution, said librarian Ninfa Duran. 
</P>
<P>
 After the men went to fight, women "were forced to step out of their 
traditional roles to defend the cause and their lives as well. They were really 
indispensable. They fought side by side with the men," Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, "Women Rise Up in Arms -- Daily Life During the Revolution," 
depicts women from a wide range of society in roles as factory workers, 
journalists and soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Text, in both English and Spanish, describes how women performed a variety of 
jobs, including cooking, caring for the injured and for children, "as well as 
risky, less feminine tasks: exchanging and smuggling information, arms, food 
and supplies." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an acknowledgment of their role that was never acknowledged before in 
history and by society in general," Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
 One photograph shows a soldier and a woman seated on the ground and gazing 
into each other's eyes, apparently in the middle of a dusty, crowded army camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the enlarged images on display show women and girls brandishing 
firearms and wearing belts of ammunition around their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Others depict middle-class women seated in rows of desks at a school, and 
impoverished women and girls carrying baskets of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the exhibit's opening coincides with an Indian rebellion over 
living conditions in the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran said that although there are similarities between the two events, they 
are vastly different in scope. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were rooted in anger over social inequities between the rich and poor, 
but the revolution involved the entire country for years, while the six-day 
revolt by guerrillas remains confined to a portion of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit runs through Jan. 27. The Main Library is at 26 Civic Center 
Drive.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; CHILD-CARE CENTER IS PROPOSED AT BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Community Services Department is hoping to open a child-development center 
that could accommodate more children at the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station 
once the helicopter base is closed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the City Council decided to apply to the U.S. Department of 
Education to acquire 5.2 acres of land and two buildings inside the base that 
could house a variety of youth programs, including art exhibits, children's 
theater and a child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Ogdon of the city's Planning Department said the military is currently 
using the buildings as a child-care center for children of military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Facilities include classrooms, playgrounds and parking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin Marine base is scheduled to close in July, 1997, and in compliance 
with federal base closure law, the Department of the Navy has began advertising 
the property for future transfer to military, federal, state and local 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogdon said that 200 to 300 acres of the 1,620-acre property may be available 
for free or sold at below-market cost to public agencies as well as nonprofit 
groups that provide services to homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Education is currently reviewing proposals for 
educational uses, Ogdon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin Unified School District has submitted a request for 103 acres of 
land to be used for two elementary school sites, one middle school and one high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the school district wants to buy the same child care facility 
that the city of Tustin is hoping to convert to a child-development center. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of school districts, colleges and universities also is proposing 
to convert parts of the base to a job training and business center that would 
include a multicultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogdon said that by next month, the Department of Education is expected to 
finish reviewing the proposals for educational uses, and a recommendation will 
be made to the Navy in March on proposals to be included in the redevelopment 
of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual transfer of land and buildings may not be made until mid-1997, 
Ogdon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Magill, a supervisor with the city's Parks and Recreation Department, 
said that the city's child-development program is run by Mothers at Work, a 
nonprofit group, from a leased building at Lambert School on San Juan Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the base facilities are needed to expand the program, which currently 
has more than 50 children, ranging in age from 2 to 6, from low- and 
moderate-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to prepare for the future," Magill said. BERT ELJERA

<P>
 A 63-year-old man killed in a San Diego Freeway collision Wednesday night has 
been identified as Frank Rose Jr. of Garden Grove, the California Highway 
Patrol said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose was driving south just north of the Seal Beach Boulevard off-ramp when 
his car was hit by a van being driven by a suspected drunk driver, according to 
CHP Officer Denise Quesada. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact of the accident was so severe that the man's car spun out of 
control and was basically cut in half," Quesada said. 
</P>
<P>
 An off-duty Long Beach firefighter who was passing by just after the accident 
pulled Rose from the car and began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
until paramedics arrived. Rose died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the van, 49-year-old James Edward Kruger of Garden Grove, 
suffered minor injuries in the crash and was treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 He was later arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and taken to Orange County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who may have witnessed the accident is asked to call the CHP's 
Westminster office at (714) 892-4426. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; CLEANUP UNDER WAY AT MCCOLL WASTE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers at the McColl toxic waste site this week began to stabilize its 
100,000 cubic yards of contaminated material by drilling and injecting cement 
into the tarry sludge pits. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency plans to solidify about half of the 
petroleum refinery wastes and build barriers above and below ground to contain 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-foot-high piece of drilling equipment will be used this month for a test 
run of the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 If the solidification works in the first pit, it will be extended to the 
remaining 11. 
</P>
<P>
 If it fails, the EPA will cap the whole site without stabilizing the tar. 
</P>
<P>
 The test should be completed by early February, according to an EPA 
spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 To test the technique, a truck-mounted drill will burrow into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns, chemicals will be pushed down into the waste to make it solid and 
safer thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some gases will be released during the drilling, but they will be collected by 
a shroud over the drill bit and sent through an air treatment system before 
they are released. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA said there may be some smelly fumes, and anyone who detects fumes may 
call the site trailer at (714) 521-6082 to report the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers will test for sulfur dioxide and other chemicals both upwind and 
downwind of the drilling area. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have complained for years that soft tarry wastes bubble up from the 
site, causing bad smells, eye irritation, nausea and headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The four oil companies that produced the waste during the 1940s have been 
ordered to pay costs of the cleanup, estimated at $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell Oil Co., Atlantic Richfield Co., Union Oil Co. of California and Texaco 
Inc. are fighting in court against paying the costs, arguing that the waste was 
produced during government-ordered World War II production. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; SCALED-DOWN PROJECT PUTS END TO CITY SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Laguna Beach has dropped a lawsuit it filed two years ago to block 
construction of a Laguna Hills business center because the proposed development 
plan has been reduced by more than 1 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The scaled-down development, which now calls for an 18-hole golf course but 
less office space and fewer parking places, was approved by the County Board of 
Supervisors in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city was satisfied with the way the project was downsized," said Stephen 
Coontz, the lawyer representing the city. "That's really what the city was 
asking for in the beginning, and now it's been worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, known as Rossmoor Business Park, will be built at the 
intersection of Moulton Parkway and El Toro Road in neighboring Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had objected to the project, largely because of concerns about the 
impact the development would have on Laguna Beach, according to a statement 
issued by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial project included about 1.4 million square feet of office and 
commercial space and about 5,400 parking spaces. The new plan calls for less 
than 400,000 square feet of building and about 2,500 parking places. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1991, the city filed suit against the developer, Rossmoor 
Partners L.P. and the county, challenging the environmental reports and the 
county approvals gained by that time. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was put on hold as the project was modified.LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; UCI EXTENDS SEARCH FOR DEAN OF MEDICINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By AILEEN CHO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A search will continue through January for a successor to Walter L. Henry as 
dean of UC Irvine's College of Medicine, officials said Thursday. Henry 
resigned abruptly last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the school is looking for someone who can take over the 
planning of a new health sciences center, scheduled to open in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commitment to a center for health sciences remains unshaken," said Karen 
Young, UCI spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry, who originally proposed the on-campus research center, resigned after a 
meeting with Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening. 
</P>
<P>
 She had rejected his proposal to divide his duties as vice chancellor of 
health sciences and dean of medicine. Wilkening said at the time that the 
proposal was too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening, who was not available for comment Thursday, will meet with academic 
leaders, the Faculty Senate and community groups throughout January, said 
Faculty Senate Chairman Jim Fallon. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings are intended to create lists of candidates for both an acting 
dean and a permanent successor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're right in the middle of both processes," Fallon said. "The chancellor 
said to wait until the end of the month after the input of groups. The acting 
dean has got to have a lot of qualities both in terms of being able to work 
closely and well with the hospital director." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry was the subject of criticism in recent years regarding proposed budget 
cuts and the low ratio of women faculty at the medical center. Some faculty 
members had said he had problems communicating on a one-on-one level. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fallon said Henry did a excellent job of bringing the faculty and 
administration closer when it came to issues involving the medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry also is credited with overcoming the medical center's $12-million yearly 
deficit in the five years he had the job. He was responsible for increasing 
outside funding from $23 million to $37 million.AILEEN CHO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; LIBRARY TO OPEN CHILDREN'S WING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Volunteers are scurrying to stack the last of 40,000 children's books on new 
shelves, landscaping is unfinished and part of the parking lot is still torn 
up, but the children's wing at Huntington Beach Central Library and Cultural 
Center is set to open Saturday at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're expecting 2,000 kids," said Jan Palmer, coordinator for the opening-day 
celebration. "All the books will be in and they can start checking them out." 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly $9-million addition will expand and encourage knowledge and 
literacy, said Palmer, a retired high school English teacher and a member of 
the Friends of the Children's Library, which has provided a major impetus and 
raised funds for the new facility, starting in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the children to know that there is more to a library than a librarian 
whispering, 'Shhhh,' " she said. The 16,000-square-foot children's wing is part 
of a 43,000-square-foot library expansion project that will include a 319-seat 
library theater, a 150-seat Story Time Theater, a learning center for 
educational films based on books, reception and banquet rooms to accommodate up 
to 350 people and a children's party room. 
</P>
<P>
 Boosters say the children's wing will serve as an outpost of culture, 
knowledge and imagination for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Library director Ron Hayden said residents are fortunate that in times when 
libraries throughout the state are closing or reducing hours, this library, in 
Central Park at 7111 Talbert Ave., is expanding and offering more services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only game in town where you can come to the library, have a meeting, 
see a play or use a computer. And if you want to sit back in a serene 
atmosphere and read a book or magazine, it's an ideal place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends of the Children's Library, the Friends of the Library and the 
Library Patrons Foundation have raised nearly $3 million for the children's 
wing. Bonds from an unused parking project contributed another $5 million, and 
other funds were shifted to the expansion from other capital projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75,000-square-foot library was built in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Free activities on tap for Saturday include visits by clowns, appearances by 
children's authors, storytelling sessions, a treasure hunt and entertainment by 
dance and music groups. Children and parents may purchase commemorative 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends of the Children's Library, sponsoring the opening day events, will 
give children bookmarks that say, "Today's readers are tomorrow's 
leaders."ROBERT BARKER

AT 100, HE'S LIVING THE GOOD LIFE; PROFILE: SAN PEDRO'S PETER BENTOVOJA VIVIDLY 
RECALLS THE BIRTH OF THE LONGSHOREMEN'S UNION IN 1933. AND HE'S STILL REAPING 
THE BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Bentovoja received the biggest pay raise of his life -- $200 a month -- 
three days before his 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Pedro centenarian's "pay raise" was actually an increase in his 
longshoremen's union pension that took effect New Year's Day. The increase 
alone, he says, is more than what he was earning when he retired 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "First thing you should buy a new chair for yourself. Your chair looks 
terrible," Maria, Bentovoja's wife of 67 years, suggested as the two sat in the 
living room of their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "And while you're at it," added Maria Bentovoja, 91, "you should buy me a new 
rocker." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has been quite a week for Bentovoja, who was the recipient of the raise and 
the guest of honor at a birthday party Wednesday from the International 
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. He is the oldest of the union's 10,000 
pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 retirees attended Bentovoja's party at the Wilmington 
headquarters of Local 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentovoja was a charter member of the union in 1933 when it was organized by 
Harry Bridges, a friend, and one of Bentovoja's two heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two men I admire the most in my life were Harry Bridges and President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt," Bentovoja told party-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks to Bridges, members of the ILWU are among the highest paid workers in 
America today. When FDR came into office, he told workers to organize for a 
better life. That's what we longshoremen on the waterfront did. Led by Harry 
Bridges, we formed a union and never regretted it. It gave us security, a good 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still giving me a good income. My union pension is now $970 a month. It 
was $80 a month when I retired 35 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Loveridge, president of the local's retiree organization, said Bentovoja 
was "one of the staunchest believers whenever Harry Bridges called a strike for 
higher wages, better benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 For the longshoremen, who handle cargo on the waterfront, the path to 
financial well-being was often dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough in the early days," Bentovoja recalled. "We fought hard to make 
headway. The strikes were mean. Six longshoremen were killed up and down the 
Pacific Coast -- two in San Pedro during the first ILWU strike (in 1934). We 
were out three months. But it paid off in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the union was formed, Bentovoja said, he was fortunate to earn $25 a 
week. "Now the guys are making almost that much an hour," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, most of the goods are packed in containers and moved around with the 
help of machinery. In Bentovoja's time, longshoremen hauled the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 But such labor came easily to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Born on the Croatian island of Korcula on the Dalmatian Coast, Bentovoja was a 
shoemaker from the time he was 12 ("I made shoes from scratch, selling them 
house-to-house") until he left for the United States seven years later. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived in America in 1913, he worked as a laborer for the Southern 
Pacific Railroad in Sacramento for four years and went on to become a streetcar 
motorman in San Francisco for four years until moving to San Pedro in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a commercial fisherman on Mexican and Canadian boats before finally 
becoming a longshoreman in 1926, the year he married Maria, who was also born 
on Korcula. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bentovojas have lived in the same house since it was constructed in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 "I paid $500 for the lot and $4,000 for the house -- a lot of money then," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They raised two sons: Pete, a retired Los Angeles Times artist, and Bob, who 
was an artist for the Los Angeles Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, Bentovoja is at a loss to explain how he has lived so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I would like to know," he replied when asked for his secret. 
"I've never really been sick. My mind is clear. I can remember everything from 
when I was a small boy all through my life. I don't need a cane to walk or 
anything like that. I have all my teeth. I don't wear glasses except to read. 
I've been very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 "Until three years ago, I walked a couple miles every day to downtown San 
Pedro to stand on a corner and visit with my old cronies," he explained, "but 
they're all dead now, and those old cronies were guys younger than me. For 
years I played pinochle every day but that ended a long time ago when all the 
other card players died. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I go visit my friends now, I have to go to the cemetery." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he spends his days cooking alongside his wife and gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 And he keeps a positive outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live for today, for a little wine and a good dinner every night," he mused. 
"For me, everyday is a wonderful day. And, why not? I'm still here."

YEARNING TO BE A BIGGER FISH; MUSEUM: A WAITING LIST FOR TOURS AND A 50% 
INCREASE IN VISITORS OVER THE PAST DECADE HAS LED THE CABRILLO MARINE AQUARIUM 
TO DRAFT PLANS FOR EXPANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium could be called the halibut of the aquarium 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 An unassuming, Average Joe of a fish, the halibut in its ocean habitat is 
unobtrusive, often lying quietly on the ocean floor, camouflaged by sand, while 
fish such as the garibaldi and blue-banded goby use their bright, colorful 
bodies to advertise their presence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro has maintained a similarly 
low-profile, albeit successful, existence for nearly 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The aquarium, run by the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department, has no 
budget for marketing so many people outside the harbor area don't even know 
it's there. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a couple of months ago, when Cabrillo dropped museum from its name in 
favor of aquarium, the only public aquarium between Monterey Bay and La Jolla 
seemed to even camouflage itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the aquarium dedicated to Southern California marine life managed to 
draw more than 360,000 visitors last year to its light gray, boxy digs, where 
they viewed the only live Pacific angel sharks in captivity, tickled sea 
urchins and listened to the snorting sounds of grazing snails. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the growing demand for marine life education, demonstrated by the 
waiting list for tours and a 50% increase in visitors over the past decade, and 
to expand its acclaimed exhibits and programs, supporters have drafted a 
long-range plan that would triple the aquarium in size. That is, if the 
aquarium can come up with the money through public grants and loans and private 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the envisioned additions is a 300,000-gallon, ring-shaped aquarium in 
which visitors could swim, much like the "Baja Reef" exhibit at the now-defunct 
Marineland of Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aquariums are really the hot items worldwide, because the ocean is still a 
mysterious realm for lots of people," said aquarium director Susanne 
Lawrenz-Miller. "People's imaginations are fired up by the idea of ocean 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy L. Svorinich Jr., who 
represents San Pedro and whose plan to build a major, tourist-attraction 
aquarium in the area has left Cabrillo enthusiasts wondering about the fate of 
the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich made no mention of Cabrillo when he first unveiled his idea, but he 
has invited Cabrillo officials to join an advisory panel for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview this week, Svorinich sought to clarify his proposal, saying 
that he envisioned his new aquarium existing hand-in-hand with Cabrillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger aquarium would be a revenue-producing, world-class facility, he 
said, while Cabrillo would serve as an auxiliary site where visitors, 
particularly children, could see creatures up close and touch them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it'd be a fantastic combination," he said. "Students can go to get a 
more hands-on, intimate education (at Cabrillo)." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Cabrillo is particularly popular among schoolchildren, who account for 
one-third of the annual visitors and come from as far as Nevada and Arizona for 
the free educational tours offered to school groups. So popular are the free 
tours that the waiting list numbers more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 60,000 people participated last year in the aquarium's off-site 
programs, which include whale watching and "grunion run" excursions. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Cabrillo's popularity is owed to its close-up look at marine life 
afforded by the smaller exhibits and lack of crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Tritel, a Northern California tourist who took his family to the aquarium 
on a recent Sunday afternoon, was awed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got gems of experience here," said Tritel, as he peered nose-to-glass 
into a tank where a mantis shrimp, cozy in a sand burrow, gathered rocks and 
shells. 
</P>
<P>
 Although accustomed to the world-renowned Monterey Bay Aquarium that is 10 
times the size of Cabrillo, Tritel nonetheless spoke enthusiastically about the 
San Pedro facility, located at 3720 Stephen White Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got the most active little octopus I've ever seen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 20,000 square feet of interior space, Cabrillo has 35 aquariums ranging 
in size from 100 to 1,500 gallons. There is also a 1,500-square-foot laboratory 
classroom for workshops and a 300-seat auditorium for lectures and multimedia 
presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 The aquariums and interpretive displays housed in the 6,700-square-foot 
exhibit hall explain Southern California marine life in three major 
environments: rocky shores; sand and mud, and open ocean. The aquarium is the 
only one in the world with live Pacific angel sharks and also boasts a 
"jellyfish farm" of translucent creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most popular attraction is the 5,000-gallon outdoor "Touch Tank," 
which allows visitors to feel a variety of animals common to tide pools. 
</P>
<P>
 At a display titled "Grazers and Browsers," a couple of young girls giggled as 
they listened to a recording of snails grazing. "Sounds like a pig," said one 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The aquarium is staffed by 25 full-time and part-time employees with help from 
about 450 volunteers. The staff, most of whom are marine biologists, do 
everything from collecting kelp and crabs in the ocean to feeding the animals 
and teaching classes. Staff members also conduct limited research, such as 
studies of local tide pools. 
</P>
<P>
 The city provides $1.5 million to run the facility. About $150,000 of the 
budget is raised by fees charged to school groups and individuals for seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, a nonprofit support group, raises an 
additional $150,000 in donations annually, according to Lawrenz-Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 No admission fee is charged at the aquarium, but Lawrenz-Miller said the 
facility will probably begin collecting one to help cover costs if it expands. 
</P>
<P>
 A general long-range plan drafted in 1990 by a group of community supporters 
and Cabrillo staff calls for the addition of 40,000 square feet, at an 
estimated cost of $20 million. Besides a swim-through aquarium, the plan 
includes a 200,000-gallon outdoor kelp tank; a live shorebird exhibit; a 
"Discovery Center" of interactive displays, and an outdoor area where large 
groups could gather or performances could be held. 
</P>
<P>
 A new 10,000-square-foot building located north of the existing facility would 
house the Marineland-like aquarium in which visitors could swim, Discovery 
Center and visiting exhibits, according to the plan. The stage area would 
include a pool for animals and about 200 audience seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabrillo staff is developing a more detailed master plan from the 1990 
document and the support group is seeking ways to raise money for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The expanded aquarium would be a far cry from its beginnings in 1935 in a 
vacant bath house, where a Venice Beach lifeguard laid out his collection of 
shells and other local specimens on a table. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles appointed a retired dentist, William Lloyd, as the 
first director of the museum. Assisted by volunteers and donors, Lloyd and a 
handful of staff continued to collect local and foreign specimens. 
</P>
<P>
 Under second director John M. Olguin, who oversaw the facility from the 1950s 
to the early 1970s, the museum developed its educational programs and organized 
public gatherings to watch whales migrate and grunion spawn on local beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, after the city obtained state and federal grants to build a 
larger museum, Lawrenz-Miller joined the staff and shifted the focus to the 
local marine environment and aquarium displays. The new facility opened in 1981 
and was designed to complement Marineland, Lawrenz-Miller said. But the aquatic 
park's 1987 closure left Cabrillo as the only public aquarium in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrenz-Miller said she hopes Svorinich is right when he says a new major 
aquarium could ultimately provide the revenue and publicity that would raise 
the profile of an expanded Cabrillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, since we want to grow, we need to make more people aware of us, 
particularly when we feel like we might be overlooked," she said.

HARMAN MAY BUY HOME ON PENINSULA; POLITICS: CONGRESSWOMAN'S PROPOSED MOVE FROM 
MARINA DEL REY TO ESTATE IN ROLLING HILLS DRAWS CRITICISM FROM CONTENDER WHO 
WANTS TO UNSEAT HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) said this week she is negotiating to buy 
an ocean-view estate in Rolling Hills, an exclusive, gated community with one 
of the highest per capita incomes in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, whose residency in the South Bay has been an issue since before her 
election in 1992, came under fire last year when she moved her two youngest 
children to the nation's capital to be closer to them. Her prospective purchase 
of a home in a community where only residents and their guests are allowed drew 
further criticism this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to say Rolling Hills is a bad place," said Rancho Palos Verdes 
Mayor Susan Brooks, who has launched a campaign for Harman's job. "But it's not 
the real world. It's insulated, it's got the security . . . and will allow her 
to go home and not deal with the public." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harman said she is not trying to insulate herself from her constituents. She 
and her husband became interested in Rolling Hills, she said, because they want 
a larger lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-bedroom house, which sits on seven acres, once had an asking price of 
more than $3 million. It would replace the home in Marina del Rey that the 
congresswoman shares with her husband, Sidney Harman, an audio equipment 
manufacturer, and their children, 9 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harmans have made an offer on the Rolling Hills property, which has a 
tennis court, but are still negotiating with the owners over such issues as 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 If an agreement on the house is reached, Harman and her husband will keep 
their $1.8-million home in Washington but plan to sell their $2-million Marina 
del Rey house, which, she said, has "no land whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 "What Palos Verdes has to offer is a reasonable amount of land," Harman said. 
"It's quiet, and it's the kind of place where I think our family could hang 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling Hills is an incorporated city of about 600 homes and a City Hall in 
the heart of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. It has no businesses or industry and a 
per capita income of more than $150,000. The only other city in Southern 
California with as high a per capita income is Hidden Hills in the western San 
Fernando Valley, according to the 1990 U.S. Census, which does not record 
incomes that exceed $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rolling Hills lies within Harman's 36th Congressional District, which 
stretches from Marina del Rey to San Pedro, the prospective purchase is not 
likely to quiet opponents who contend that Harman is tied more closely to 
Washington than to the district she represents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harmans, who have lived on both coasts since 1980, made Marina del Rey 
their primary residence two years ago. Before that, they owned a home in 
Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 election, opponent Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke 
Flores frequently portrayed Harman as a carpetbagging outsider who moved to the 
area solely to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has continued to sound the theme despite Harman's protestations that 
she made 31 trips to the district last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, in a campaign newsletter published by Carpetbagger Press, wrongly 
reports that Harman has already purchased a mansion in Rolling Hills and 
suggests as a housewarming gift "Maps of the South Bay." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not moving in," Brooks added. "The only one who's going to live there 
is the butler." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, who lives in a three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot tract house in Rancho 
Palos Verdes, says Harman's interest in Rolling Hills shows "she's not down 
with the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman said that is nonsense. "The residents of Rolling Hills are friendly, 
down-to-earth people. It's not the part of Palos Verdes with the fanciest homes 
-- not by a long shot."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; PETS IN CLOSED CARS SUBJECT OF ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council gave tentative approval Tuesday to a law against leaving 
animals unattended in vehicles without proper ventilation. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was proposed by Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr., who said pets 
left in cars can be endangered by temperatures rising to levels that can cause 
brain damage or death. 
</P>
<P>
 On an 85-degree day, the temperature inside a car where a window is open just 
half an inch will rise to 102 degrees in 10 minutes and then quickly go higher, 
according to a report presented to the council by Purcell. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officer Keith Hall said Wednesday that such treatment of 
animals is "a big problem" for Laguna Beach in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably get about five calls a week in the summertime during the hot 
weather," he said. Often, Hall said, people will leave their dog in a car that 
is shaded but stay away long enough for the sun to shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't realize the shade moves and the dog is out in the sun in 
120-degree weather. In just a matter of minutes, it can be dead," he said. "In 
the summertime, it's best if they're going out for the day to just leave the 
puppy home." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new city law, which is expected to win final City Council approval 
later this month, violators would receive a citation similar to a traffic 
ticket. The misdemeanor carries a maximum penalty of a $1,000 fine and/or six 
months in jail. LESLIE EARNEST

 A search committee at UC Irvine has appointed faculty member Spencer Olin, 56, 
acting executive vice chancellor of the university, beginning March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Olin, dean of the School of Humanities since 1992, will begin his new job when 
Executive Vice Chancellor L. Dennis Smith leaves for his new job as president 
of the University of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was functioning very happily as dean of humanities and was indeed 
surprised," he said. " But having contemplated it for some time, I decided it 
was a challenging opportunity and one I would welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Olin, one of UCI's founding members in 1965, will fill the job until the 
search committee, formed after Smith's announcement in November, finds a 
replacement.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'll do an excellent job," said Smith, who has been at UCI since 
1990. "He has extensive experience as chair of the senate and he's worked on 
major academic issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith added that the major problem his successor will deal with is budget 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Olin will lead two task forces Smith has appointed to make recommendations on 
dealing with budget cuts and academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We discussed (the budget issues) extensively. . . . He's very well prepared 
to accept the responsibilities," Smith said. "The campus is in good 
hands."AILEEN CHO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; OK FOR SOFTBALL PARK PROJECT IS SOUGHT

 There aren't any cornfields near Alton Athletic Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials hope to transform the park into a Field of Dreams for 
baseball and softball enthusiasts with a series of improvements that would 
bring batting cages, a scoreboard and bleachers to the Alton Parkway facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will vote on the first phase of the project at its Tuesday 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 With council approval, the city will spend as much as $28,000 to add two 
batting cages and batting machines to the park, which already has four baseball 
diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will require workers to trench through the baseball field with 
wires so that the batting machines will have a power source, said Ronald 
Morgan, associate engineer for the city. Officials plan to have the machines 
operating by Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also hopes to install by the end of March a concrete slab behind the 
batting cages to serve as a foundation for aluminum bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 A scoreboard and a scorer's table might also be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said the improvements correspond with an increase in the popularity of 
softball. Among those likely to use the batting machines are some of the city's 
numerous softball tournament leagues, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are creating the creature comforts," he said.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; COUNCIL OVERRULES PLANNERS ON CARWASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A carwash and gas station will open here now that the City Council has 
overturned a Planning Commission decision against the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members this week voted 3 to 2 to reverse the commission's action 
taken last September, when commissioners said the project was not an 
appropriate land use for the southeast corner of Lambert Road and the Orange 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the same reason, Mayor Glenn G. Parker and Councilman Burnie Dunlap 
cast the dissenting votes against the appeal at Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to allow the project on the empty lot, the council had to change the 
city's Land Use Zoning Code for the area from "office/financial" to "general 
commercial." 
</P>
<P>
 Until Tuesday, only office buildings could be built on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not opposed to the carwash, but I think this is an unfortunate site for 
it," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council members who voted for the project said it would add value to the 
area. Currently, there are no carwashes in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the carwash being a service that the residents in the area can use," 
said Councilwoman Bev Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners said the war wash will be open within six months. MIMI KO

ALTERNATIVE WATER SOURCES URGENTLY NEEDED, STATE TOLD; ENVIRONMENT: REGIONAL 
AGENCY OFFICIALS SAY MORE WATER MUST COME FROM SACRAMENTO-SAN JOAQUIN DELTA. 
BUT THE NEED WILL PIT DIVERSE INTERESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regional water agency executives Thursday urged the state to swiftly develop 
alternative water sources to avert severe shortages predicted to occur during 
the next 30 years by the state Department of Water Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 John V. Foley, chairman of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California, which provides water to nearly 16 million people in six counties, 
told officials during a hearing, "The state needs to act quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 He said it's especially important in the short term to develop alternative 
water sources because the amount of water transported south from the 
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta will be limited for environmental reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 However, water industry representatives said ultimately, more water must be 
taken from the delta. The complex issue pits environmentalists, the fishery 
industry and other interests that advocate strong delta protections against 
those who stress the need to divert more water for agriculture and domestic 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence P. Gallagher, chairman of West Basin Municipal Water District, said a 
balance can be reached over the delta. 
</P>
<P>
 "The critical water issue in California is managing the fragile delta estuary 
in a manner that can preserve the environment and balance the multiple uses of 
its water resources," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the water officials emphasized pursuit of other sources to secure adequate 
water supplies for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 They talked about the importance of waste-water recycling, off-stream water 
storage instead of building expensive new reservoirs, better managing ground 
water and, to a limited extent, looking more at desalting ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley added another suggestion to develop more water resources. "State 
cooperation with local agencies should include streamlining regulatory hurdles 
for new facilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Department of Water Resources report predicted that by 2020, most 
Californians will experience frequent and severe water shortages in both 
drought and normal years. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing Thursday was the first of 10 scheduled throughout the state before 
the final water report is submitted to the Legislature in June.

IRVINE AGENCY THEFT CASE GOES TO JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury was asked Thursday to decide whether 
Clyde E. Weinman is a heartless thief who stole from the homeless or a 
dedicated do-gooder who sacrificed to help those in need. 
</P>
<P>
 The former director of Irvine Temporary Housing -- an organization that helps 
the homeless -- faces 13 felony counts of forgery and grand theft and is 
accused of forging more than 500 checks, totaling nearly $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors began deliberating in the case Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman, 44, insists he never took money that did not belong to him. Weinman 
said he plunged nearly $65,000 of his own savings into charity coffers to cover 
bills and keep it running, and that he only took back about $60,000 to cover 
his own living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman said he is being made the scapegoat for "shoddy" management and 
persistent under-funding at at the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "All he is doing is struggling to keep the program afloat and himself and his 
family afloat," defense attorney Milton Kerlan told the jury, urging them to 
find Weinman not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. William Overtoom told jurors not to be fooled. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stole it, he diverted it for his own use. He did it secretly. He did it 
with lies," the prosecutor told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency administrator Margie Wakeham said outside of court that Weinman never 
notified the charity's board of directors about financial shortfalls and cannot 
blame others. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the management. He was hired to be the management," said Wakeham, who 
said the organization has struggled to recover. "The board did not have a true 
picture of what was going on at Irvine Temporary Housing."

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. DAY; MONTH OF MEMORIES HONORS CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. will be honored this month 
with events to spark the memories of those familiar with his legacy and 
introduce him to those too young to recall his work. 
</P>
<P>
 King was born in Atlanta in 1929, and his birthday was made a federal holiday 
in 1986. This year, the celebration falls on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 A Montgomery preacher, King won the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize for his gospel of 
tolerance and his efforts to attain black civil rights through nonviolent 
protest. He was assassinated April 4, 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Among area celebrations is a "Brotherhood/Sisterhood Show" at 11 a.m. Saturday 
at the Redondo Beach North Branch Public Library, where children 2 to 12 will 
learn about King's lessons of tolerance and friendship through a series of 
humorous sketches. In the half-hour performance an actor gradually dons costume 
and makeup, transforming himself from just another tall, lanky guy to a clown 
with a message. 
</P>
<P>
 The is especially appropriate for preschoolers, a spokeswoman said. Children 
and adults must check out three children's books each to gain admission. The 
library is at 2000 Artesia Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Cultural Committee in Gardena marks its 21st 
annual celebration of his life beginning with Youth Program Night, tonight at 
Rowley Park, 13220 S. Van Ness Ave. Local youngsters will perform music, 
dramatic readings and display artworks in a salute to King. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's ninth annual community parade begins Saturday at 10 a.m. at 
the Civic Center, 1700 W. 162nd St. The parade, featuring bands, drill teams 
and community organizations, will travel north to Rowley Park, where 
entertainment, food and games will await, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Carson, the South Bay Pavilion has planned a free three-day arts festival 
to honor King beginning Jan. 15. The event will feature arts and crafts from 40 
artisans. Free afternoon entertainment will include dance and musical 
performances. The Pavilion is at the San Diego Freeway and Avalon Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 Carson will have its 10th annual tribute to King on Jan. 15 at the Carson 
Community Center. The three-hour event begins at 2 p.m. and will feature gospel 
music, modern dance performances, dramatic readings and other reflections on 
King's life and work. The center is at 801 E. Carson St. 
</P>

ZEKE HERNANDEZ OPENS BID FOR UMBERG'S ASSEMBLY SEAT; POLITICS: THE SANTA ANA 
BUSINESSMAN IS ONE OF THREE LATINOS EXPECTED TO SEEK THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION 
FOR THE 69TH DISTRICT. ABOUT 37% OF REGISTERED DEMOCRATS THERE ARE LATINO.

<P>
 A 47-year-old businessman from Santa Ana announced Thursday he will seek the 
Democratic nomination for the 69th State Assembly District, possibly setting up 
a three-way contest among Latino candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeke Hernandez said he will run in the June 7 primary against two other Latino 
candidates in a district where 37% of registered Democrats are Latino. The 
others, Ted R. Moreno, a Santa Ana councilman, and Enriqueta L. Ramos, a member 
of the board of trustees of Rancho Santiago College, are expected to announce 
their candidacies later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 They, along with Republican candidates Virgil Nickel, assistant director of 
Veteran's Charities of Orange County, and Jim Morrissey, an Anaheim 
businessman, will pursue the seat that is expected to be vacated by Tom Umberg 
(D-Garden Grove), who announced plans to run for state attorney general. Umberg 
is the only Democratic legislator in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 All three Latino candidates are members of the Democratic Chicano Caucus and 
have discussed at monthly meetings the possibility of rallying behind one 
candidate so that the Latino vote would not be split. But each opted to stay in 
the race to give the community a broader choice, said Dorianne Garcia, 
chairwoman of the Orange County Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may make things difficult as far as splitting up the vote, but they have 
all committed to running clean campaigns," Garcia said. "They wanted the 
community to have its choice in this race." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district, which represents Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa Ana, 
is largely Democratic, it has a reputation for electing Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hernandez, Ramos or Moreno win in the general election on Nov. 1, it would 
mark only the second time a Latino has won an Assembly seat in Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 In his last of four unsuccessful campaigns for Santa Ana City Council, 
Hernandez received about 21,000 votes, establishing a base that he said will 
continue to support him in his run for the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez served as the state director of the League of United Latin American 
Citizens, or LULAC, and board member of the Santa Ana Housing Advisory, a group 
that was instrumental two years ago in overturning a redevelopment plan of the 
Santa Ana City Council. The plan, according to the advisory group, would have 
displaced Latinos living in low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana native also was a member of a group that filed a complaint 
against the county health and transportation departments in 1992 alleging that 
Latinos were being excluded from planning and administrative posts there.  
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, making his announcement at the Catholic elementary school he 
attended 40 years ago in Santa Ana, pledged to make crime fighting his first 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of our children are gaining self-esteem through a gun. We need to 
replace that with more respect for people," he said. During the hourlong 
conference, he said he would work to get more police officers out on the 
streets and develop preventive programs such as youth recreation centers.

HE'S KING OF THE LIONS' COURT; ALTHOUGH WYKING JONES CONTINUES TO IMPRESS WITH 
HIS IMPROVED PLAY, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT'S LOSING STREAK IS A SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has been playing the best basketball of his life, but Wyking Jones refuses 
to be satisfied with any part of his game. 
</P>
<P>
 Not with his 62% shooting, which ranks among the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
 Not with his 17.3 scoring average, which leads Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even with his emerging confidence, which was lacking in two previous 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Loyola (0-9) continues to lose, Jones will remain one unhappy 
fella. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I see it, if I get 25 points and we lose, I'm not going to be happy 
about that," he said. "I'm never going to be 100% satisfied with any 
performance that I give." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's 92-91 overtime loss to Fairfield was especially hard for Jones to 
handle. After the game, the 6-foot-7 junior forward went back to his room on 
the Westchester campus and tried to tune out the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out of it," he said. "Mentally I was very distraught. I just didn't 
know what to say. I didn't want to talk to anyone on the phone or see anyone. 
It's always tough to sleep after the game. I try not to think about it, but 
it's hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The postgame blues have become a regular part of Jones' life as a college 
athlete. Loyola has not won since Jan. 30 of last season, and its 19-game 
losing streak is currently the longest among Division I teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But any frustration Jones feels after a loss is gone by the time he returns to 
the court. Despite Loyola's string of failures, he said the players haven't 
gotten down on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone tries to stay positive," he said. "If we put our heads down and feel 
as though we're losers, then we're never going to win. We just have to keep 
working and giving 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Jones is doing his part. The former St. Bernard High standout 
leads Loyola in scoring, field-goal shooting (57 of 92), rebounds (42), blocked 
shots (10) and minutes played. He leads West Coast Conference players in 
field-goal percentage and ranks in the top four in scoring and blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 In back-to-back games last month against UC Santa Barbara and San Diego State, 
Jones totaled 51 points, grabbed 16 rebounds and made 19 of 27 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' emergence after two uneventful seasons as a Lion reserve -- he started 
only four of 51 games and averaged 3.5 points -- hasn't come as a surprise to 
second-year Coach John Olive. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive said Jones worked harder than any Loyola player last summer and has 
become a team leader by example, despite a quiet, unassuming manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he doesn't have the personality (to be a leader), he definitely has the 
work ethic for it," Olive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because senior forward Zan Mason is sidelined indefinitely because of torn 
knee ligaments, Olive said Jones will have to shoulder more responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's obviously our No. 1 option inside and he's responded," Olive said. "We 
have gone to him a number of times in the last few games and he's done a good 
job of getting baskets down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones credits his improvement to maturing mentally more than physically. 
During his first two seasons at Loyola, he was often unsure of himself and 
lacked confidence in games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have easily had the type of season I'm having now last year," Jones 
said. "But my focus wasn't there. Last year I would get it every now and again, 
but it wasn't consistent. It's all confidence; being sure about what you're 
doing out there and knowing that you can make something positive happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all players go through that. I think confidence is a very big part of 
a guy's  
</P>
<P>
 success or failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones seemed destined for success after an impressive prep career at St. 
Bernard, where was affectionately known as Wyking the Viking, a reference to 
the school's nickname. He backed up former Arizona center Ed Stokes as a 
sophomore and led the team in scoring and rebounding as a junior and senior, 
earning All-Southern Section honors both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 When recruiters came calling, Jones' first instinct was to get away from Los 
Angeles, despite the fact he was a Loyola ball boy for the 1985-86 and 1986-87 
basketball teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But he decided to sign with the Lions and stay close to his family in 
Inglewood after his stepfather, Luther Harper, was found to have cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my dad got sick, I felt that I had to stay home," said Jones, who picked 
the Lions over Oregon, Oregon State, UCLA and UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper died shortly before Jones' freshman season at Loyola, leaving Jones as 
sort of a surrogate father to his five younger brothers and sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take my little brothers to the movies and to the park," he said. "We have a 
good time together." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones also enjoys the company of his Loyola teammates, who, in a show of 
solidarity, have all shaved their heads for tonight's 7:30 game against the 
University of Buffalo (4-8) at Gersten Pavilion. The look was first adopted 
earlier this season by freshman point guard Jimmy Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive has helped promote the team's togetherness, Jones said, by having 
meetings that allow the players and coaches to express their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of heart-to-heart talks," Jones said. "It brings out everyone's 
frustrations. I think it helps bring things out in the open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Olive always stresses the little things. Before, I don't think we paid 
as much attention to him when he told us that. Now everyone realizes that it is 
the little things that make the difference. In the past few games, it's been 
letting the other team get offensive rebounds. Or a silly foul. We're all 
starting to realize it is the little things." 
</P>
<P>
 With Jones leading the way, Loyola has come close to ending its losing streak 
in recent games. The Lions' last three losses, including two in overtime, have 
been by a total of seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than become discouraged, an optimistic Jones thinks Loyola is on the 
verge of turning its season around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a strange feeling that once we win that first game, everyone's 
confidence will be boosted so much that we'll get it going a little bit," he 
said. "It will be like getting the monkey off our backs. We'll be a little more 
confident, a little more loose." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, a little bit more like Wyking Jones is playing.

COLLEGES / IRENE GARCIA; SHE HAS PUT HERSELF IN A GOOD POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Loyola Marymount's Nikki Rouillard got hurt last season, freshman Marlee 
Webb was called on to take over the duties at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Webb, a two-time league most valuable player at Hanks High in El 
Paso, Tex., had been a shooting guard throughout her career, she quickly 
adjusted to the position change. Webb finished with averages of 6.5 points, 
four assists and three rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-7 Webb started this season at the point but was moved to shooting 
guard after Lianne Ishikawa, a sophomore transfer from Cal State Fullerton, 
became eligible last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb has not lost her shooting touch. In her first full game as a shooting 
guard, she scored a career-high 19 points in the Lions' 89-67 loss to Nevada 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb has become one of the Lions' most consistent players, averaging 9.8 
points, 4.5 assists and 3.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Loyola's 90-77 win over Wayland Baptist of Texas, a National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics school, on Dec. 31, Webb had 12 points and 11 
assists. She ranks fourth in the West Coast Conference in assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "She sees the floor real well," Loyola Coach Todd Corman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb's aggressive play also appeals to Corman. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is probably the one player in our backcourt that really penetrates," 
Corman said. "By doing that, she opens up the inside." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no telling what Webb could do if she were at full strength. A torn 
meniscus in a knee has forced her to spend extra time in the training room. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the season, she will decide between surgery and an intense 
rehabilitation program to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's in the training room one hour before practice and half an hour after 
games," Corman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Webb played three seasons at Hanks High and averaged 19.2 points, seven 
assists and six rebounds as a senior, when the team advanced to the second 
round of the state playoffs and finished 25-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb, who was named to the West Texas region team, was also named most 
valuable defensive player of the El Paso District. She was also recruited by 
the Texas El Paso and Texas San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first saw her at an all-star postseason tournament," Corman said. "She led 
a team of underachievers to four wins over teams that outmanned them. That 
really impressed me. She has a strong will to win." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 West Coast Conference coaches picked the Loyola women to finish second the 
league, but the Lions have given no indication of being a winner in 
nonconference games. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola had lost seven-consecutive games, including a 73-57 loss to NCAA 
Division II opponent Cal Poly Pomona on Dec. 21. The Lions finally snapped the 
streak on Dec. 22, defeating New Mexico, 52-43. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions (4-8), who beat Cal State Northridge, 79-52, on Thursday night, will 
play at Southern Utah on Saturday in their last nonconference game. Loyola 
opens league play on the road against St. Mary's on Friday. The Lions' first 
conference home game is Jan. 21 against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Sheri Brown is Loyola's leading scorer, averaging 14 points and 
7.5 rebounds. Center Amy Lundquist averages 13.6 points and 7.5 rebounds. The 
6-foot-5 Lundquist, a sophomore from Wisconsin, leads the WCC in blocked shots 
with 24. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Dominguez Hills women's basketball team may be overwhelmed when 
it opens league play against Division II powerhouse Cal Poly Pomona on Jan. 15. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But Toro Coach Van Girard says he is glad to play the Broncos early in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pomona, as far as I'm concerned, is head and shoulders above everybody else 
in this league," Girard said. "Playing them first is good because it will give 
us an idea right away of how much progress we need to make and what we need to 
do."  
</P>
<P>
 The Toros (7-7) will complete their nonconference schedule on Monday at 
Division I Cal State Northridge. Dominguez Hills will play host to NAIA 
opponent McKendree College of Illinois on Saturday at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toros are led by senior guard Karee Bonde (12.9 points) and junior forward 
Trimeka Jackson (10.7 points). Jackson, a 5-foot-11 transfer from Long Beach 
City College, also leads Dominguez Hills in rebounds at 10.1 a game. Sophomore 
guard Katina Duncans leads the team in assists (4.1). 
</P>
<P>
 "We've steadily improved the level of our play," Girard said. "We're in the 
position that I thought we would be in going in to conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Junior point guard Carlos Paul of the Dominguez Hills basketball team had a 
career-high 25 points in the Toros' 94-79 loss to Anselm College of New 
Hampshire last week . . . Dominguez Hills senior forward Joe Bertrand became 
the first player in school history to record double figures in rebounds for six 
consecutive games . . . Faye Hagan, a sophomore forward, recently transferred 
to Dominguez Hills from Cal State Fullerton and will be eligible to play this 
season. The 5-foot-8 Hagan averaged 6.3 points and 5.3 rebounds as a part-time 
starter last season. "She's going to help us out a great deal," Coach Van 
Girard said. "We're real excited about having her." . . . Loyola soccer coach 
Peter Novakovic and his wife, Helene, had their first child, Peter Christopher, 
on Christmas Day.

 Loyola Marymount freshman Mike O'Quinn has been ruled ineligible for the 
remainder of the basketball season after he failed to meet the university's 
academic requirements for student-athletes in the fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Quinn played as a reserve in all nine games for winless Loyola, averaging 
7.8 points and 4.1 rebounds. The 6-foot-5 forward was an All-Southern Section 
selection at Muir High in Pasadena last season and was considered the Lions' 
top recruit. ROB FERNAS

O.C. THEATER / JAN HERMAN; EXPECT A CAST OF ECLECTIC CHARACTERS IN SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The months ahead promise a world of contradictions at the county's prime 
venues, with stage appearances by everyone from Frankie and Johnny to Spalding 
Gray, Tommy and the Phantom. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no self-respecting year of theatrical offerings could get by 
without Evita and Annie or, at the very least, Susan Anton fronting the Radio 
City Music Hall Rockettes. So expect them to show up here with bells on. 
</P>
<P>
 If that doesn't slake the county's thirst for fare of every stripe, there's 
always the possibility of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe 
with spaced-out Trudy somewhere on Storefront Row, a figurative place of brave 
little theaters installed in out-of-the-way commercial malls and basements and 
on local college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 King Lear is also making plans to divide his kingdom in that neighborhood. And 
the classic black American family from the '50s, the Youngers of Chicago's 
South Side, will get its chance to be counted there. 
</P>
<P>
 Another brood of a much earlier time, the Millers of small-town Connecticut, 
also will be turning up, as will the Class of '59 from Rydell High. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is Hedda Gabler who launches 1994 with a bang tonight at South Coast 
Repertory in a Mainstage revival of Henrik Ibsen's century-old play titled 
(what else?) "Hedda Gabler." (Previews continue through Jan. 13; the regular 
run opens the following night.) 
</P>
<P>
 Is she a pre-feminist hero of mythic stature or just a gun-toting, 
manic-depressive housewife who makes trouble for everybody, herself above all? 
</P>
<P>
 To put it another way, are her inchoate yearnings for liberation from a life 
of provincial repression the stuff of tragedy or melodrama? 
</P>
<P>
 "We see her as an archetype," director David Chambers said earlier this week 
in Costa Mesa. "We're looking at the play as one might look at a Greek play, 
recognizing the power of fate. We're interested in her spiritual and 
psychological journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ibsen's plays in the 20th Century have been locked in the drawing room. He's 
been put in a post-Freudian bag. The take on the plays tends to be 
psychological and sociological.  
</P>
<P>
 "While those are not elements to be ignored, we have to remember he was an 
extraordinary poet. Psychology and sociology are not all he was interested in 
by any stretch of the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hedda Gabler" (through Feb. 13) ought to have a formidable actress in the 
title role. Chambers has cast Lynnda Ferguson as Hedda, and she certainly has 
shown herself capable of commanding the stage in previous SCR roles. 
</P>
<P>
 SCR-goers will remember her most recently as Marianne in "The Miser" and 
before that as Olivia in "Twelfth Night," both also directed by Chambers. But 
she also starred as a much underrated Tracy Lord in "The Philadelphia Story" 
and made her SCR debut as the downed aviator in "Misalliance." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson has been surrounded with a cast possessing top-notch credits. Most of 
the supporting players are newcomers to SCR. But if they measure up to the 
quality of the sterling Nicholas Hormann, an SCR veteran also cast in the 
production, we're in for a great ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, SCR has enlisted Ralph Funicello to design the set and Shigeru Yaji 
the costumes, which virtually guarantees an arresting visual look. And Chambers 
has written a new English version of the Norwegian text, reworking it from a 
commissioned literal translation. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I have not colloquialized the language, there is very definitely an 
abbreviation," Chambers said. "I've deflowered the language, if you will, and I 
hope it is has a Pinteresque impact for its brevity, economy, tautness and 
ambiguity. The play is shot through with mysteries and ambiguities. It has 
extraordinary menace." 
</P>
<P>
 Although SCR has done only one Ibsen play before ("A Doll's House" in 1978), 
it will turn later this month to a longtime favorite, the South African 
playwright Athol Fugard, on its Second Stage. Three of his works have been done 
at the theater ("The Blot Knot" in 1982, "Master Harold . . . and the boys" in 
1985, and "The Road to Mecca" in 1989). 
</P>
<P>
 This time SCR will mount the ironically titled "Playland," a work about the 
aftermath of apartheid that had its U.S. premiere two years ago in San Diego 
(to mixed reviews). SCR artistic director Martin Benson, an old hand at Fugard 
stagings, will direct. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playland" (Jan. 25-Feb. 27) will go up in Costa Mesa just before the 
beginning of nationally designated Black History Month -- February -- and 
doubtless will teach a lesson about race relations in Fugard's deeply humane 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, which has just two actors and is set in South Africa, focuses on a 
white war veteran and a black watchman of an amusement park. They confront each 
other on New Year's Eve, 1989, in a battle of wills and tortured confessions 
until the sun comes up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alternative Repertory Theatre in Santa Ana also is gearing up for Black 
History Month with a production of "Raisin in the Sun," Lorraine Hansberry's 
1959 drama about Lena Younger's hope of buying a house and moving her family 
out of Chicago's black ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're expecting a lot of student groups," said ART spokesman Gary 
Christensen. "Even though people may not have seen the movie (of 'Raisin') with 
Sidney Poitier, they've heard of it. The play has a very special place in the 
black community. It has a mythology. It's a sort of national treasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately following "Raisin" (Jan. 28-March 5) ART will stage Ray Bradbury's 
"Dandelion Wine"(March 18-April 9), a reminiscence of childhood about a man who 
goes back to his hometown to recapture his youth and reconciles himself with 
his past. 
</P>
<P>
 After that comes "The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe," 
Lily Tomlin's spacey one-woman show of the '80s (written by Jane Wagner). 
Tomlin did it all over the country and in Los Angeles and took it to Broadway. 
But, so far as we can tell, it has never been done in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 ART will not have Tomlin's services, however. Nor will "Search" (May 6-June 
11) be done as a one-woman show. Director Patricia L. Terry has decided to use 
an ensemble of five women instead. They'll be playing Trudy, of course, as well 
as Agnes and Kate and Chrissy and all the other inimitable characters Tomlin 
originated. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, over at the Laguna Playhouse's Moulton Theatre in Laguna Beach, 
artistic director Andrew Barnicle is preparing the world premiere of John 
Twomey's "Teachers' Lounge" (Tuesday through Feb. 6), which is described by the 
theater as a humorous look at a year in the life of a school system on the 
verge of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Playhouse has done original works before in its long and venerable 
history, but not often. Barnicle, who is directing "Teachers' Lounge," says it 
is "just as accessible as anything we do here. It's a linear play with real 
people in it. I'm not exploring or experimenting with theatrical form in front 
of my audience here. 
</P>
<P>
 "What interests me," he adds, "are the characters and the subject matter and 
the questions the play raises. It's amusing and poignant and very timely." 
</P>
<P>
 Later this year the Playhouse also will stage "Ah, Wilderness!" (March 
15-April 10), Eugene O'Neill's comic (for him) recollection of youth through 
the eyes of Nat and Essie Miller and their son, Richard. That will be followed 
by "The Mystery of Irma Vep" (May 17-June 12), Charles Ludlam's transvestite 
spoof of Gothic horror shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Playhouse combination is, to say the least, eclectic.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted plays that offer counterpoint to each other rather than any through 
line," Barnicle says. "The reason we're doing 'Irma Vep' is just to get some 
Ludlam up on our stage. I tend to look at playwrights who are either 
interesting or neglected. I also want to put on one American classic in every 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to eclectic, however, nobody can compete with the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. Its Broadway Series for the rest of this year continues 
with "Grease" (Mar. 29-April). "The Who's Tommy" (May 10-15), "The Great Radio 
City Music Hall Spectacular" (June 14-19) and "The Phantom of the Opera" (July 
22-Aug. 28). 
</P>
<P>
 "Grease" will have stand-up comic Rosie O'Donnell among its Rydell High 
graduates and, like several other recent entries in the center's Broadway 
Series ("My Fair Lady," "Camelot" and "Gypsy"), is a road revival on a 
pre-Broadway tour that will take it to, rather than from, New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Who's Tommy," a rock musical about a boy who is blind, deaf and mute, is 
still on Broadway. It was developed at the La Jolla Playhouse in 1992 and 
became a smash hit there. Then it opened in New York and was hailed by the 
critics as the best rock musical ever to appear on Broadway, where it won five 
Tony Awards (though not the one for best musical). 
</P>
<P>
 "The Great Radio City Musical Hall Spectacular" is supposed to be more than a 
mouthful of words. Created to celebrate the hall's 60th anniversary, it will 
feature the Rockettes and Susan Anton. Just what Anton has to do with the 
hall's legendary history is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Lloyd Webber fans will not want for fare this summer. The nearly 
six-week booking of "The Phantom of the Opera" is the longest of any event in 
the center's history. Though not as large as the production that played Los 
Angeles, it will come complete with chandelier. The casting hasn't yet been 
decided. But don't expect any name stars. 
</P>
<P>
 In shorter bookings and in decidedly less glitzy terms, El Teatro Campesino 
and Spalding Gray will come to the Irvine Barclay Theatre for one-night 
engagements. 
</P>
<P>
 El Teatro Campesino will revive Luis Valdez's play "I Don't Have to Show You 
No Stinking Badges!" (Feb. 16), about a middle-aged Latino couple that has made 
a successful living as the "King and Queen of Hollywood extras." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray will do his latest monologue, "Gray's Anatomy" (May 1), which revolves 
around a traumatic eye operation that ultimately led to his marriage but, as 
with all Gray's kaleidoscopic tales, gets into the myriad nooks and crannies of 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at SCR the rest of the Mainstage season features a world premiere of 
Richard Greenberg's "Night and Her Stars" (March 4-April 3) and revivals of 
Peter Shaffer's "Lettice & Lovage" (April 15-May 15) and Brian Friel's "Dancing 
at Lughnasa."  
</P>
<P>
 The theater company is particularly high on the new Greenberg play, as might 
be expected for a commissioned work. But SCR producing artistic director David 
Emmes speaks of it as "a breakthrough" for Greenberg on a par with "Prelude to 
a Kiss," which launched Craig Lucas on a huge trajectory. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg had another play done at SCR with mixed results ("The Extra Man" in 
1991) and is best known for "Eastern Standard," which premiered in Seattle and 
went to Broadway as the quintessential play about Manhattan yuppies of the 
'80s.  
</P>
<P>
 In "Night and Her Stars" Greenberg reaches back to the '50s for a look at the 
TV quiz show scandals that catapulted people like Charles Van Doren to fame 
and, as it turned out, lured them into ethical quicksand. 
</P>
<P>
 On SCR's Second Stage the rest of the season will offer "Someone Who'll Watch 
Over Me" (March 8-April 17), a hostage drama by Frank McGuinness that was 
nominated for a Tony Award on Broadway last year, and a still-unnamed play in 
the final slot (April 26-May 29). 
</P>
<P>
 The big summer events for Shakespeare Orange County will be Thomas F. Bradac's 
staging of "King Lear" with Alan Mandell, one of the Southland's premiere 
classical actors, in the title role. SOC also will do "Twelfth Night." Both 
plays will be produced at Chapman University's Waltmar Theatre, dates to be 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 We haven't forgotten Evita and Annie. The Fullerton Civic Light Opera promises 
"Evita" (Feb. 18-March 6) for Plummer Auditorium, along with "Annie" (May 
13-29) and "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" (July 15-31). FCLO producer 
Griff Duncan also says the company will stage another outdoor summer season of 
three plays -- one musical, one comedy and one drama -- at the Muckenthaler 
Center, with titles to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in Fullerton, the Vanguard Theatre Ensemble opens the year tonight with 
the Michael Cristofer's "The Shadow Box," (through Feb. 5), followed by John 
Olive's "Voice of the Prairie" (March 2-April 2); Timberlake Wertenbaker's "The 
Love of the Nightingale" (April 27-May 28); "Talley's Folley" (June 29-July 
30); Ruth and Augustus Goetz's "The Heiress" (Sept. 7-Oct. 5); and Arthur 
Miller's "The Crucible" (Oct. 26-Dec. 1) 
</P>
<P>
 Vanguard, which is entering its third season this year, recently incorporated 
as a not-for-profit institution and has already made its mark as one of the 
county's prime storefront theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 But another storefront operation, the three-year-old Backstage Theatre in 
Costa Mesa, will fold at the end of January, following Terrence McNally's 
"Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune" (tonight through Jan. 30). 
</P>
<P>
 "We're closing up here at the end of that run," Backstage producer Al Valletta 
said, adding that he hopes to stage shows in Los Angeles instead.

THE 36TH GRAMMY NOMINATIONS; GRAMMY NODS: THE POPULISTS LEAD THE WAY; 
COMMENTARY: TO ISOLATE THE RECORDINGS AMONG THE NOMINATIONS THAT DEFINED POP OR 
ROCK DURING 1993, ONE HAS TO TURN TO SECONDARY CATEGORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whose nominations were those Thursday? Were they from the Grammy Awards, the 
American Music Awards or the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's start at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Music Awards, announced last month, are designed solely to 
acknowledge popularity and sales, right? 
</P>
<P>
 So it's understandable that Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" and 
"The Bodyguard" soundtrack were nominated as the year's favorite single and 
album, respectively, in the AMA competition. Both sold umpteen million copies 
and topped the charts interminably. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Grammy Awards, whose nominations were released Thursday, are designed 
to salute artistic excellence, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet here we find Houston's records nominated again. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's possible for the best record of the year to also be the most 
popular, but we've all heard "I Will Always Love You," so we know that's not 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait: The ways of the Grammy get even more confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is designed to look back over the years to 
slowly, but deliberately, honor the artists who made a difference -- the 
artists whose best work not only defined the times in which we live, but, in 
some cases, actually helped shape them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sting, Donald Fagen, R.E.M. and Neil Young are superior artists who have 
demonstrated over the years the kind of consistent quality and vision that will 
almost certainly earn each of them a Hall of Fame induction. 
</P>
<P>
 But their flurry of nominations in this year's Grammy competition seems, 
collectively, more a factor of their career history than their specific 
accomplishments during 1993. And don't forget how last year's Grammy ceremonies 
seemed like a Hall of Fame induction as it turned into a virtual testimonial to 
the career of Eric Clapton, who won six awards. 
</P>
<P>
 To isolate the recordings among the Grammy nominations that defined pop or 
rock during 1993, you have to turn, once again, to the secondary categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The three most compelling albums of the year are lumped together in the 
alternative music category: Nirvana's "In Utero," Smashing Pumpkins' "Siamese 
Dream" and U2's "Zooropa." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the most celebrated singles, meanwhile, are limited to the rap 
duo-group category: Digable Planets' "Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)" and Dr. 
Dre's "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang." 
</P>
<P>
 In the area of mainstream pop, the most surprising omission from the best 
album or best single competition was Janet Jackson, whose "janet." album 
contained some of the most sensual and appealing dance-minded pop in years. 
</P>
<P>
 So, who deserves our support in the two key categories? 
</P>
<P>
 Album of the Year: The 7,000 voting members of the National Academy of 
Recording Arts & Sciences clearly feel most comfortable in voting for the tried 
and the true whenever they step out of the pop mainstream world of Whitney 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Between them, Sting, Billy Joel and R.E.M. have won 18 Grammys during the 
years. Donald Fagen hasn't won any Grammys, but he, as a former member of the 
hugely respected '70s band Steely Dan, is also clearly tried and true. 
</P>
<P>
 Any of those three choices is superior to "The Bodyguard," a mediocre album 
from an even more mediocre film. But Sting's "Ten Summoner's Tales" and 
R.E.M.'s "Automatic for the People" are the class of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sting's album added some welcome wit to the British rocker's usual 
elegance and craft, the R.E.M. collection was an ultimately more satisfying 
package: a superbly designed, deeply felt introspective collection, whose 
"Everybody Hurts" and "Man in the Moon" provided two of the year's most magical 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Record of the Year: You can see how overblown Houston's version of "I Will 
Always Love You" is by simply listening to Dolly Parton's original version, 
which has been a hit twice in the country field. Peabo Bryson and Regina 
Belle's "A Whole New World" was no more convincing emotionally, while Billy 
Joel's "The River of Dreams" was middle-brow pop. That leaves the race between 
Sting's warm "If I Ever Lose My Faith in You" and Neil Young's dreamy "Harvest 
Moon." 
</P>
<P>
 I'll be cheering louder than anyone if Young finally wins his first Grammy, 
but the nod here goes to Sting, whose song was a disarming expression of 
personal devotion in an age of disillusionment.

TRIBUTE; SWIFTY LAZAR: EVOLVED HEART, EVOLVED STYLE; THE FOLLOWING IS A 
TESTIMONIAL BY AUTHOR LARRY MCMURTRY, AUTHOR OF "LONESOME DOVE" AND "TERMS OF 
ENDEARMENT," TO IRVING (SWIFTY) LAZAR, WHO WAS THE WRITER'S AGENT "FOR MANY 
YEARS." A SHORTER VERSION OF THIS TEXT WAS DELIVERED ON THURSDAY BY MCMURTRY AT 
A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR LAZAR, WHO DIED ON DEC. 30 AT AGE 86.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first reference I can remember seeing to Irving Paul Lazar was in S. J. 
Perelman's Paris Review interview. Mr. Perelman, himself a notably stylish and 
fastidious traveler -- I believe he drove a Mercedes along the Silk Road as far 
as Tashkent -- mentioned in passing that the only man he knew who could step 
off an airplane anywhere in the world with his hands in his pockets was Irving 
Lazar. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a youth when I read that passage, and did not understand what a resonant 
tribute it was: a compliment paid by one great stylist to another. As a 
wordsmith S.J. Perelman was impeccable; as a traveler, like most of us but 
unlike Irving, he tended to get frazzled. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving Lazar's style, at home or abroad, did not tolerate frazzlement. He 
stepped off the plane with his hands in his pockets -- excellently turned 
pockets, too -- minus such impediments as the suit bags, claim checks, diaper 
bags, crumpled tickets and lost composure that burden most mortals when they 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
 A mere six weeks before Irving's death I dined with him at Chasen's. He was in 
a wheelchair then. When we returned home he wheeled himself around his house 
for a while, looking for some object or other to give me; while he wandered and 
considered, remembering the shop off Bond Street where he picked up his bone 
china, or the gallery in Nice where he secured the little Matisse, I happened 
to open a silver cigarette box given him by Walter and Carol Matthau. It was 
engraved with the following tribute: "You have that rarest of things, an 
evolved heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, so he did -- and he had an evolved style , too. But there is a Catch-22 
to great styles: the higher you wind them, the tighter the catch. Our styles 
tend to make us; then, if we last long enough and nothing beats them to it, 
they break us. Irving's devotion to fine European footwear rotted his feet and 
contributed its jot to his demise; but, then, we are all going to demise some 
way. Who's to say that too-tight English shoes shouldn't introduce the finale? 
</P>
<P>
 When I read the Perelman interview I had no suspicion that the man named 
Irving Lazar, who stepped off planes on the preferable continents with his 
hands in his pockets, would someday be my agent. At the time, and for many 
years afterward, I had an agent, Dorothea Oppenheimer, a wonderful if eccentric 
woman who got through life on an intricate balance of beauty and bravura. 
Dorothea was born in a castle on the Danube and died in a one-room apartment on 
York Avenue, in New York City. In the three painful years that it took her to 
die, Irving, with uncustomary discretion, quietly did the work of agenting me. 
He treated Dorothea with the distinguished courtesy he bestowed on those who 
possessed what he called quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothea Oppenheimer had quality, even in the dusty apartment on York Avenue, 
and unto the hour of her death. Irving deferred to it, and behaved impeccably. 
A dying, impoverished European woman got the credit -- then minimal -- for 
selling "Lonesome Dove." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, Irving's eye for quality instantly spotted this elusive 
element in the appearance and demeanor of a much younger woman -- my 
goddaughter Sara Ossana, then 12. Irving and Mary were in London, ensconced in 
their accustomed suite at Claridge's, a suite the King of Spain was allowed to 
use when Irving didn't happen to be in town. Sara and her mother, Diana Ossana, 
now my screenwriting partner, happened to pass through on short notice; on even 
shorter notice (an hour, approximately), I called Irving and suggested dinner. 
The Lazars had planned to go to a birthday party for the King of Greece, a 
party to which numerous Windsors were coming, including the Queen and the 
glamorous young Princess of Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving instantly changed his plans. "I see those people all the time," he 
said, and an hour later Sara and Diana and I were dining with Irving and Mary 
in the grand ballroom of Claridge's. Irving spent the evening admiring Sara's 
haircut -- a world-class haircut she had given herself, only the day before -- 
and harassing the captain to rush yet more delicacies to Sara's plate. On the 
basis of an excellent haircut and a few minutes conversation, Irving took Sara 
up and was unfailingly generous to her from then on. She was one of the few 
young women of her generation allowed to bring her boyfriend to the Oscar 
party; to the end, Sara loved Irving and Irving, Sara. 
</P>
<P>
 T. S. Eliot once made a famous remark about Henry James, who, Eliot said, had 
a mind so fine that no idea could penetrate it. Irving's mind was not unlike 
Henry James'. The texts that he agented rarely, if ever, penetrated it, except 
by osmosis. For years, once he became my agent, I waited for some chance 
statement that would indicate that he had read at least a page or two of the 
many books he agented for me; the statement never came.  
</P>
<P>
 Life, in the Scott Fitzgerald sense, was always glimmering out there 
somewhere: drinks, fine women, dancing, French food, exciting talk, and the 
endless parade of the great and famous, the beautiful and bold, were Irving's 
texts. Not for him the contemplative hour with Horace or Virgil; despite which 
he was, in his bones, a literary man. He honored writers and never, to my 
knowledge, allowed himself to confuse the work of literature with the 
subliterary bestseller. He reaped millions off bestsellers -- in the way of the 
street -- but his first and fiercest loyalties were to those who attempted 
literature, and, Truman Capote excepted, he didn't expect to find them at Spago 
or Le Cirque. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a man of the cafe and the boulevard, Irving lavished his energies on not a 
few people who were spoiled well past the point of putrefaction; he was 
sometimes careless when it came to separating the wheat from the chaff. But 
manners -- what he called "the correct thing" -- mattered to him to the end. If 
Irving really cared about you, as he cared, for example, for Dorothea and Sara, 
it was necessary that you do the correct thing. With Dorothea this meant dying 
with her courage intact. With Sara, it meant exacting discipline in the matter 
of haircuts. When people abandoned their standards, and proved unable, in the 
difficult situation that life is sure to bring us, to do the correct thing, 
Irving's judgment was immediate, and, frequently, final. Lady Keith could tell 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 In his year of bereavement, after Mary's death, Diana and Ossana and I saw 
Irving often. On our last visit, a few weeks ago, he rose out of sedation and 
talked lucidly and lovingly, for almost an hour, about Bogart and Hemingway. He 
spoke about Bogart's death, and Hemingway's torment. But then he began to 
reminisce about their good times -- he ceased to talk about them as if they 
were dead and spoke as he might speak of people who were traveling, people whom 
he would probably see again, as it might be, when he was passing through Paris, 
or lunching at "21." 
</P>
<P>
 In humans the grace that lasts is probably always moral, and always tragic. 
Irving and Mary are gone, and the community of the arts is diminished. Irving 
was a larger-than-life figure in a town that, but for the great magnifying 
glass of the screen, would be in most ways smaller than life. His intelligence 
and his taste brought an element of refinement to a culture in most ways crude. 
His taste reached back to the Europe of the great West Coast emigres: Mann, 
Stravinsky, Renoir. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few links to that time left, and none who sustained the range of 
contact and reference that Irving Lazar commanded. With his passing, in the 
words of Thomas Nashe, the Renaissance poet, a brightness has fallen from the 
air. Irving himself, at his 85th birthday party, lamented the devaluation of 
glamour, as he saw it, in a town where movie stars seldom take the trouble to 
be movie stars anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, speaking of President Reagan, whose memoirs he didn't get to agent, 
Irving consoled himself with this reflection: "That's all right -- pretty soon 
he'll be where Franco is." 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, Irving took ship first. The prince of agents, the man who 
could step ashore, or out of a plane, or off a train with his hands in his 
pockets, is traveling now. We can be sure that a car will be waiting, at the 
dock, or the airport, or the station. The best suite will be his, at the best 
hotel; the clothes will have been unpacked; the captain will be waiting 
deferentially at the best table in the best restaurant, where the best company 
will soon gather to dine and drink till eternity cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't be sitting with Franco, though. Irving will be traveling in that 
greatly peopled borne where Mr. Kafka dines with Mrs. Woolf, and Papa breaks 
bread with Baudelaire. And should it be that either the Lord of Light or 
(better yet) the Prince of Darkness is ready to sell his memoirs, Irving Paul 
Lazar will get right on the phone.

 Hot off her landmark Las Vegas concerts, Barbra Streisand will join Whitney 
Houston, Patti LuPone and Doris Day, among others, at the seventh Commitment to 
Life event -- the entertainment industry's biggest fund-raising event to combat 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 27 program to benefit AIDS Project Los Angeles at the Universal 
Amphitheatre will honor First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Walt Disney 
Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg for their efforts in health care and in the 
fight against the disease.

</P>
<P>
 Streisand's publicist, Richard Guttman, said that the star does not plan to 
sing and will be on hand to introduce Mrs. Clinton. Show producer Steve Tisch 
said that he and co-producer Dana Miller have asked Streisand to consider 
singing one song from her Las Vegas show. "It would be sensational if she 
does," Tisch said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1992's event, which raised $3.9 million, Streisand made one of her rare 
singing appearances when she was the recipient of a Commitment to Life award. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers said the theme "Heaven Can Wait" will run through the show and 
serve as a tribute to celebrities lost to the disease. Each performer has a 
direct relationship to a lost celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance by Day, who will sing, is a rare one, and is prompted by her 
friendship with the late actor Rock Hudson. Houston, who will sing two songs, 
knew choreographer Michael Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 Others to be remembered include Peter Allen, Howard Ashman, Arthur Ashe, 
Liberace, Robert Mapplethorpe, Freddie Mercury, Paul Jabara and Halston. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnelli, who was married at one time to Allen, will sing "And the Day After 
That," from the musical "The Kiss of the Spider Woman," with a chorus of 200. 
The song has become an unofficial AIDS anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said that LuPone will sing "As If We Never Said Goodbye," from the 
musical "Sunset Boulevard," as the faces of lost celebrities pass on a screen 
behind her. LuPone, who stars in the London company of the musical, will fly in 
for one night. She has performed in APLA shows before and, Miller, in answer to 
a question, said that her appearance had nothing to do with any attempt to 
upstage Glenn Close, the star of the Los Angeles edition of "Sunset Boulevard," 
and with whom LuPone appears to be in competition for the lead in the show's 
eventual New York company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, Glenn Close will be singing that night at the Shubert Theatre," 
Miller added. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers said that some free tickets will be made available to APLA's 
clients and that the names of about 10,000 persons who have died from AIDS will 
be rolled across a screen during the course of the show. "They are all 
celebrities," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-chairs of the evening are QVC Chairman Barry Diller, Walt Disney Co. 
Chairman Michael Eisner, show business mogul David Geffen and Creative Artists 
Agency partner Ron Meyer.

MICHAEL JACKSON SHARES WHITNEY HOUSTON'S SPOTLIGHT; HONORS: HOUSTON WINS FIVE 
NAACP IMAGE AWARDS, BUT JACKSON GETS CHEERS IN A SHOW MARKED BY CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was Whitney Houston's night, but Michael Jackson dominated the 26th annual 
NAACP Image Awards with a five-minute speech of his own before presenting 
Debbie Allen with a choreography award. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson received a standing ovation from the audience gathered at the Pasadena 
Civic Auditorium Wednesday night and had to pause several times during his 
remarks to let the cheers from the audience subside. 
</P>
<P>
 After thanking the crowd several times, Jackson made a brief but forceful 
statement: "Everyone is presumed to be innocent and totally innocent until 
charged with a crime and then convicted by a jury of their peers. . . . Not 
only am I presumed to be innocent, I am innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has been accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy, but criminal charges 
have yet to be filed. Early in the show, one presenter included Jackson in a 
list of names, calling him "Michael (Innocent Until Proven Guilty) Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston won four awards -- for best female artist, music video, album and 
soundtrack album -- in addition to her previously announced Entertainer of the 
Year award. Houston's mother, gospel singer Cissy Houston, and brother Gary 
received a standing ovation for their rendition of "Amazing Grace," sung in 
tribute to Houston's special award as Entertainer of the Year, which was 
presented by actor Denzel Washington. 
</P>
<P>

 Controversy was the byword of the evening, with Fox TV star Martin Lawrence 
winning both outstanding actor in a comedy series and outstanding comedy series 
for "Martin," which has been criticized for its sexual high jinks. Lawrence 
obliquely defended both himself and another nominee, rapper Tupac Shakur, when 
he repeated parts of his acceptance speech in the pressroom, saying, "We come 
down on a lot of the young people . . . just for speaking what people have 
lived." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Political Congress of Black Women had accused the NAACP of sexism 
for not withdrawing Shakur's nomination for outstanding lead actor in a motion 
picture (for his role in John Singleton's "Poetic Justice"). Shakur has been 
charged with felony counts of forcible sodomy and unlawful detainment in New 
York City, where a woman alleges that Shakur and two other men held her down in 
a hotel room while a fourth man sodomized her. Shakur was also charged with two 
counts of aggravated assault in an unrelated incident in which he allegedly 
shot and wounded two off-duty police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Several celebrities were visibly annoyed by the press's questions about 
Shakur, and it was stressed several times that Shakur has only been charged 
with, not convicted of, the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are innocent until proven guilty," said Jasmine Guy, winner of 
outstanding actress in a comedy series (for "A Different World"). Guy demanded 
of one reporter if she had actually heard Shakur's music and, when the reporter 
said no, said, "Come back and ask me those questions when you have." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox TV star Sinbad impishly leaned forward when he had to return backstage and 
said to the press, "Too bad I couldn't get the Tupac question." 
</P>
<P>
 The award for best actor went to Denzel Washington for his role in "Malcolm 
X." 
</P>
<P>
 "Malcolm X," which itself was an object of controversy at last year's Academy 
Awards when it was nominated for just two Oscars -- for best actor and best 
costume design -- received awards in every category in which it was nominated, 
including outstanding motion picture. In addition, the award for outstanding 
literary work, nonfiction, went to "By Any Means Necessary: The Trials and 
Tribulations of the Making of 'Malcolm X,' " by director Spike Lee with Ralph 
Wiley.

TOOLS FOR SUCCESS; CLAW HAMMER IGNORES RULES OF ROCK, BUT THE FOUNDATION IS 
BUILT FOR A MAJOR-LABEL ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The four members of Claw Hammer freely admit that they lack many of the 
accouterments that an aspiring, success-oriented alternative-rock band ought to 
have. They don't seem very concerned about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had a manager, never had a lawyer. We haven't toured enough. 
There's a lot of things we should have done that we didn't do," says co-founder 
Christopher Bagarozzi, breezily running down the check-list of rock-biz do's 
and don'ts Claw Hammer has managed to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to make tons of money," the burly guitarist continued, "but for me 
the goal was to be in a band that I liked, and I didn't care if anybody else 
did. I wanted to please myself." 
</P>
<P>
 In its seven-year existence, even without the assistance of managers and 
lawyers, the Long Beach/Los Angeles band (playing tonight at Our House in Costa 
Mesa) has managed to make a good deal of thoroughly wired, hard-edged music 
that weds a bluesy feel with a punk-rock sense of abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 The key feature of Claw Hammer's sound is the raucous yet honed guitar 
interplay between Bagarozzi and the band's other founder, Jon Wahl. Largely 
dispensing with the distortion and simple-mindedness of grunge-style guitar, 
Claw Hammer's four albums feature two equal players riffing and soloing freely 
and simultaneously in a way that implies chaos yet adheres to well-conceived 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Claw Hammer guitarists are steeped in the underground-rock tradition, 
citing as models such twin-guitar precursors as the MC5 and Television. At 
their sizzling best, abetted by the flexible bass-and-drums team of Rob Walther 
and Bob Lee, they can call to mind the thrust and probing spaciousness achieved 
by the Meat Puppets, whose Curt Kirkwood is one of the best guitarists to have 
come out of the indie-rock boom of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Wahl, who sings and writes the lyrics, tries to make up in maniacal impact 
what he lacks in melodiousness. His drawling and yelping echo and amplify the 
nasal style of Television alumni Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell, with some of 
the twisted-blues phrasing of avant-rock hero Captain Beefheart thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beefheart's "Trout Mask Replica" album held a place of honor at the front of a 
stack of LPs in Wahl's living room, where the members of Claw Hammer gathered 
for a recent interview. That's not surprising for a band that named itself 
after one of the album's tracks, "Orange Claw Hammer." 
</P>
<P>
 The room's dominant feature was a large portrait of a female nude with her 
feet in a fish tank and a crestfallen look on her face. The dominant feature of 
the conversation was the absurdist quip: Ask a question about Claw Hammer, and 
all four members' first instinct is to say something facetious. 
</P>
<P>
 Claw Hammer started pounding late in 1986 after Bagarozzi answered a 
musician-wanted ad placed by Wahl. 
</P>
<P>
 A product of the fertile Fullerton-area punk rock scene, Wahl had attended 
Placentia High School where classmate Mike Palm, the leader of Agent Orange, 
sold him his first guitar and taught him how to play it. Wahl got some national 
exposure in 1985 when he joined the Pontiac Brothers and played on their 
acclaimed U.S. debut, "Doll Hut." But he quit the Pontiacs after nine months, 
despite their then-bright prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something weirder, something more like Claw Hammer is doing," 
he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagarozzi was living in El Toro at the time, taking film classes at Cal State 
Long Beach and getting frustrated over his inability to find a band he liked 
playing in. When he saw the influences listed in Wahl's ad -- the MC5, Mott the 
Hoople, the Stooges and the Replacements -- he answered it and got the job, 
even though the ad sought a piano player, not a guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
 D.A. Valdez moonlighted as the new band's bassist until his duties as drummer 
for the Pontiac Brothers called him away on tour. He dubbed the band Thunder 
Lizards for its first gig, a name that made Wahl and Bagarozzi cringe. They 
chose "Claw Hammer" after discovering a mutual admiration for the arcane but 
enchanting Beefheart. 
</P>
<P>
 Walther replaced Valdez on bass in 1987, after Claw Hammer had debuted with 
singles for Trigon Records, a label owned by Wahl's brother. Lee signed on in 
1990 after the band had recorded its first album. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were never serious at first," Bagarozzi recalled. "I never thought we'd 
put a record out. I thought we'd just play. We played for years in L.A. to 
hardly anybody showing up." A shared billing at Al's Bar in 1989 with Nirvana 
was attended by about 70 people. 
</P>
<P>
 But Claw Hammer began to win fans. One was Long Gone John, owner of the Long 
Beach-based independent label Sympathy for the Record Industry, who underwrote 
the band's first three albums. Another was Brett Gurewitz, guitarist with the 
successful punk band Bad Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are my favorite band," Gurewitz said in a separate interview. "Their 
improvisational bits are absolutely genius, and they do it within the context 
of pop songwriting. I think that makes them a lot different and a lot greater 
than pretty much anything I've heard recently." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gurewitz has produced all four Claw Hammer albums, taking a live-in-the-studio 
approach. He says he would have signed Claw Hammer immediately to Bad 
Religion's own label, Epitaph, but he didn't want to usurp the smaller Sympathy 
label. With its 1993 album, "Pablum," Claw Hammer moved to Epitaph, which could 
afford more promotional and distribution push. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the band's more eccentric moves was its decision in 1990 to duplicate in 
its entirety Devo's first album, "Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!" Band 
members say they got the idea from the New York City band Pussy Galore which in 
1986 released a song-for-song recapitulation of the Rolling Stones' "Exile on 
Main Street." Claw Hammer got Devo's blessing for the project, which featured 
rough, slam-it-out takes on each song from the influential New Wave artifact. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo provided liner notes for the Claw Hammer tribute, 
which was called "Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are NOT Devo!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Could I listen to this album every day?" he mused. "Maybe if I was younger. 
Maybe if I still had the brain cells to sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Claw Hammer has been weaning its live audiences from the Devo stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets the kids going. It's an easy crowd-pleaser," Lee noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the Devo thing is a big crutch," Wahl confessed.  
</P>
<P>
 The songs from "Pablum" are a typically skewed lot. Among the ones most 
readily intelligible (Wahl says he emphasizes sound over sense in his 
lyric-writing) are "Speak Softly," an acerbic slam at Michael Jackson issued 
before his latest celebrity conflagration. In "William Tell," Wahl set out to 
reprimand Beat author William S. Burroughs for the episode in which he 
accidentally shot his wife to death in a drunken attempt at a feat of 
marksmanship. But in writing the song, Wahl decided a non-judgmental approach 
would work better. "Nick" is a straightforward if impressively manic account of 
a chat Wahl had with a homeless man at his neighborhood self-service laundry. 
Among other virtues, it's the only song I've heard that includes the phrase "LA 
Times" (the paper is cited not for any journalistic attributes but for its 
utility as cheap bedding). 
</P>
<P>
 Claw Hammer has gone on a few national tours including a 1992 trek with 
Mudhoney and a 1993 outing with Rocket From the Crypt. And now that big record 
companies are scouring the independent ranks for new alternative stuff to throw 
against the wall, Claw Hammer has had contact with a few major label scouts. 
Walther says they all tell the band to get a manager and a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the change in mainstream tastes, it really is conceivable that a band 
like Claw Hammer could be a major-label act. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible. Whether that's a good thing or not is something else," said 
Lee, who works with Walther at a medical equipment company in Sylmar. Wahl, the 
band's oldest member at 32 (Lee, 25, is the youngest) works in the warehouse at 
Epitaph Records, and Bagarozzi is unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Epitaph recently anted up $5,000 for Claw Hammer's first video, "William 
Tell." Band members noted with a combination of pride and sarcasm that MTV 
rejected it out of hand because it contained scenes of boozing and implied 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for another album for Epitaph before this winter is out; Wahl says 
any future move to a bigger label would be contingent on the band members 
getting total control over all creative decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, they say, Claw Hammer hasn't changed much from the band that 
started out wanting just to please itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (commercial success) happened, that would be nice," Bagarozzi said. "But 
as soon as you try to figure out how to get rich off it, whatever it is (that 
makes a band special) won't be there any more." 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't about to trade a special essence for commercial success. "If you're 
playing in a band you don't like, it's worse than having a 9 to 5 job." 
</P>
<P>
 * Claw Hammer, Uncle Joe's Big Ol' Driver and the Iron-ons play tonight at Our 
House, 720 W. 19th St., Costa Mesa. Show time: 9 p.m. $3. (714) 650-8960.

 You may not care if your kids take over the bathroom or your wardrobe ("Dad! 
Don't you have any bigger pants?"), but this year, tell 'em to keep their mitts 
off your filofax. 
</P>
<P>
 It's for their own good, really, because there are several family shows coming 
up that look like they're worth penciling into your calendar. Most groups are 
sticking with adaptations of folk tales and children's classics, so it's not 
what you'd call an eclectic lineup, but there are a few new works or 
works-in-progress that look intriguing. And if your child and checkbook balance 
are so inclined, many companies offer classes and workshops throughout the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Take ye note . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, Laguna, Mission Viejo Something old and something new-ish are coming 
up at the Laguna Playhouse Youth Theatre ((714) 494-0743 or 497-5900, Ext. 
207). From Feb. 11 through 20, there'll be R.N. Sandburg's "Anne of Green 
Gables," which follows the exploits of a spirited girl and her adoptive family 
in rural, turn-of-the-century Canada. April 22 through May 1, the company will 
present Norton Juster's comic fantasy "The Phantom Tollbooth." (Note: Children 
under 4 will not be admitted to Youth Theatre productions.) 
</P>
<P>
 On April 28, the Youth Theatre's advanced acting group, the Repertory, will 
present a fund-raising performance of "Lost Children," a work-in-progress by 
Repertory students that features monologues and vignettes based on true stories 
of Los Angeles street children. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes for ages 4 to 17 will continue, as will an in-school program for 
children with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Irvine Barclay Theatre ((714) 854-4646), national and international 
touring acts providing family entertainment this year will include the Swiss 
mask-mime troupe Mummenschanz (March 12), Avner the Eccentric with his silent 
one-man show (April 9), the Pickle Family Circus (May 27-29) and the comic 
juggling/theater/improv group the Flying Karamazov Brothers (Oct. 23). 
</P>
<P>
 Limited seating may be available for the National Theater for Children's 
"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp" (April 18 and 19) and "The Wizard of Oz" (May 16 
and 17). And watch for a summer or early fall production at the Barclay from 
the innovative Theatrefaire for Children of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerts by singer/songwriter/puppeteer Norman Foote don't strictly qualify as 
theater, but they are hugely entertaining and packed with improvisational humor 
that plays well to kids and adults. He'll be at Saddleback College in Mission 
Viejo ((714) 582-4656) Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa, HuntingtonBeach, Westminster In Costa Mesa, South Coast 
Repertory's Young Conservatory Players ((714) 957-4033 or 957-2602) has "Rags, 
Sticks & Ropes: The Fables of Aesop" April 28 and 29 in the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center's Founders Hall. Tickets for these shows, part of the 
countywide Imagination Celebration, will cost half the usual YCP admission 
price. After these performances, the show will tour. 
</P>
<P>
 SCR's 1994 Educational Touring Production, "Finding Home," a revival of a 1984 
musical that views immigration and cross-cultural understanding from a young 
person's perspective, will visit area schools from February through May. Free 
public performances will be given Feb. 8 at SCR and May 1 in Founders Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 YCP will close its season with "One Thousand Cranes" June 11 through 19 on the 
SCR Second Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 (Local playwrights, take note: YCP director Diane Doyle says she would 
consider opening the '94-95 season with a play that addresses Jewish traditions 
and holidays, if the right script could be found.) 
</P>
<P>
 SCR's 20-year-old Young Conservatory actors' training program will continue 
throughout the year, as will the Neighborhood Conservatory, an outreach program 
targeted to low-income youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in tough times, Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa ((714) 432-5880) seems 
to have the scratch to book plenty of family entertainment. Up next: the Potato 
People, a Canadian company that mixes masks and animation in a comic sketch 
titled "Survive the Great Outdoors!" It will be here Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep an eye on the Huntington Beach Library ((714) 842-4481), which is 
scheduled to unveil its massive new children's wing Saturday. The wing will 
include a performance space and storytime theater in which the Huntington Beach 
Playhouse and others will present kid-friendly shows. Also in Huntington Beach, 
little literati may want to stop by Golden West College ((714) 895-8378) on

ANOTHER SUPER CHALLENGE; ENTERTAINMENT: TUSTIN FIRM HOPES TO WOW A DOMESTIC TV 
AUDIENCE OF 130 MILLION WITH ITS SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Super Bowl halftime show is an odd bird. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the audience comes for football, not for song and dance. The 
costly extravaganza lasts only 11 minutes, with only five minutes before and 
after to set up and tear down. And it must captivate the year's biggest U.S. TV 
audience -- an estimated 130 million viewers -- not to mention the 75,000 fans 
in the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in a nutshell, is the challenge that special-events producer Dennis 
Despie has faced four times in the past -- and will again on Jan. 30 in 
Atlanta. His Tustin company, Select Productions International, was picked by 
the National Football League to orchestrate Super Bowl XXVIII's halftime 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despie has had easier assignments. He didn't get all of this year's big-name 
performers lined up until three weeks ago after country music star Garth Brooks 
backed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I've been panicked," Despie admitted, pretending to bite his fingernails 
-- which are, in fact, already suspiciously short. "But we'll be all right. It 
will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 His confidence is based on a history of impressive feats: He produced former 
President Ronald Reagan's 1985 inaugural parade, the 1983 and 1987 
inaugurations of former California Gov. George Deukmejian, and the 1987 Pan 
American Games in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Despie carved a niche for himself in the special-events industry while he was 
vice president of entertainment for Walt Disney Co. During his 15 years with 
the theme-park giant, Despie produced his first three Super Bowl halftime 
shows, as well as numerous Disney attractions, including the popular Electrical 
Light Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided eight years ago to strike out on his own. "One of the reasons I 
left was because I couldn't separate my personal life from my work life -- 
Disney owned me seven days a week," said Despie, 48, who lives with his wife 
and two grown children in Anaheim. "Now I still work seven days a week, which 
leads me to believe it wasn't Disney at all, it was me." 
</P>
<P>
 Despie's company consists of four staff employees and, at any given time, an 
additional 100 or so temporary employees: costume designers, choreographers and 
musical directors hired to help out on a particular contract. Select 
Productions had revenue of about $4 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dennis Despie is one of the top talents in the business today," said Steve 
Clark, president of Management Resources, a leisure-industry consulting firm in 
Tustin. "There are not many people in the entire country who can produce the 
caliber of shows he does." 
</P>
<P>
 The special-events industry has grown dramatically in the past few years, with 
sports promoters, Las Vegas hotels and amusement parks all demanding 
increasingly sophisticated entertainment. "That's what the consumer wants," 
Clark said. "And Dennis has done a good job of expanding with the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the NFL approves of Despie's work, for it keeps coming back for more. 
"Dennis has his feet firmly planted on the ground," said Jim Steeg, director of 
special events for the NFL. "Other companies come to us saying, 'We can make 12 
elephants disappear.' Dennis says, 'This is what we can do within your budget.' 
He understands our objectives." 
</P>
<P>
 Steeg wouldn't disclose just what the halftime budget is this year, other than 
to describe it as "seven figures." But the NFL's objectives are no secret: to 
woo the live audience while -- even more important -- keeping home viewers 
glued to their TV sets. NBC charged Frito-Lay $3.6 million to sponsor the 
halftime show, and the food company wants its advertising dollars to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's show, produced by Radio City Music Hall of New York, set a 
precedent that will be hard to follow. Historically, Super Bowl halftimes have 
taken their theme from the host city. But 1993's halftime replaced custom with 
a mini-rock concert: Michael Jackson, live, at the Rose Bowl. TV viewers stayed 
tuned, and the NFL cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 So now NFL officials want more of the same. The only problem is, busy 
superstars are tough to pin down, as Despie has discovered. For most of the 
year, he has been working on a country music show that was to have spotlighted 
Garth Brooks. But Brooks had a change of heart, leaving Despie to scramble. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the near catastrophe, Despie ended up with a respectable collection of 
celebrities: Wynonna Judd, Travis Tritt, Tanya Tucker and Clint Black. They 
will perform from a 7,000-square-foot stage constructed in 22 sections. 
Special-effects devices -- for lighting, smoke and pyrotechnics -- have been 
built underneath the segments, each of which will be rolled onto the field by 
10 volunteer workers. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Despie has never experienced a humiliating flop, he said. However, at 
the 1990 Super Bowl in New Orleans, he came close. For the halftime show, which 
featured jazz musicians, his company designed an elaborate stage that unfolded 
into a huge riverboat. The stage was meant to fit unobtrusively along the 
sidelines until time for use. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Despie arrived at the stadium with his stage a week before the event, 
he realized that it would block the view of hundreds of fans during the game. 
"We had to cut two feet off the stage so we could store it in the main tunnel," 
he said. "Then when halftime came, we ran out, unbolted the goal posts, lifted 
them out with a crane, and pushed the stage out on the field. Thank God the 
thing fit in the tunnel. I was a very nervous man." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he'll be a nervous man again as he sits in the Atlanta stadium, waiting 
for another Super Bowl halftime to come to a close. Then he and the hundreds of 
employees and volunteers who made it happen will celebrate wildly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the biggest high in the world," Despie said, "when the show is over, 
everything went as planned, and you know you entertained millions of people."

LATE PRESIDENT'S MOTHER TAKES IN-N-OUT REINS; FAST FOOD: CO-FOUNDER ESTHER 
SNYDER KEEPS CONTROL OF PRIVATELY HELD COMPANY IN FAMILY HANDS AFTER SON'S 
DEATH IN PLANE CRASH. HIS BROTHER IS NAMED CHAIRMAN AND HIS WIDOW JOINS THE 
BOARD. MOVE TO IRVINE NOT AFFECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In-N-Out Burger Co. co-founder Esther Snyder has taken over as president of 
the family-owned fast-food company following the death of her son, Richard A. 
Snyder, in a Dec. 15 plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Snyder, a company vice president and Esther Snyder's older son, has been 
chosen for the new position of chairman, and Christina Snyder, Richard's widow, 
has joined the privately held company's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Snyder, 41, president of the burger chain since 1976, died along with 
Executive Vice President Philip R. West, 37, and Jack Sims, a Placentia public 
relations executive, when their chartered corporate jet crashed near Santa Ana 
Auto Mall. Pilots Stephen R. Barkin, 46, and John O. McDaniel, 49, were also 
killed when the jet went out of control apparently after encountering 
turbulence generated by a Boeing 757 that was landing at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder family members and officials at the close-knit company have declined 
requests for interviews. "We will still be a family-owned and -operated 
company, and we will continue to respect the privacy of the family," In-N-Out 
Vice President Carl Van Fleet said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and business associates said it wasn't surprising that the Snyders 
chose to keep in the family's hands the day-to-day management of In-N-Out 
Burger, which Esther Snyder and her husband, Harry, founded in 1948 in Baldwin 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Snyder died in 1976. Despite health problems, Esther Snyder has remained 
active at the company, most recently as secretary and treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Esther still works in the company's restaurants on a regular basis," said 
real estate agent Sally Anne Sheridan, a former Irvine mayor who became 
acquainted with several In-N-Out executives while helping to lure the burger 
chain's corporate headquarters to Irvine. "She's a real hands-on lady . . . 
very, very sharp." 
</P>
<P>
 In-N-Out, which hopes to complete its move to Irvine from Baldwin Park in 
February, has 93 restaurants, most of them in Southern California, and about 
2,500 employees. Company executives told employees earlier this week that 
In-N-Out will stick to the Snyders' slow-growth strategy. The family in the 
past has rejected offers to sell out or make a public stock offering, electing 
instead to expand cautiously without taking on debt or selling franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have put the company up for sale, made it a public company or sold 
it to the employees," Sheridan said. "But they've evidently told the store 
managers that they'll continue as a family business and try to fulfill 
everything Rich set out to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The management changes evidently will give Guy Snyder a bigger role. Family 
friends said that he and his younger brother often were at odds but were in 
agreement on Richard having a dominant role in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 While Richard concentrated on running the company, Guy moved to a ranch in 
Northern California and raced automobiles. During a humorous and touching 
eulogy at his younger brother's memorial service last month, Guy acknowledged 
the pair's sometimes troubled but loving relationship, including Richard's 
reticence to fund the automobile racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richie and I sometimes couldn't even sit down and talk about things," Guy 
told 2,000 mourners during the ceremony at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa in 
Santa Ana. "(But) Rich always stuck up for me. I always did everything first. 
Richie always supported me. This one time, Richie went first. What happened has 
changed a lot of people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder also hinted then that he might be playing a bigger part at the company: 
"We just have to keep taking that step forward. . . . If I can follow in his 
footsteps, I will be the happiest person in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 It was uncertain this week what role Christina Snyder will have. The Snyders 
were married in the spring of 1992 and lived in Newport Beach.

NEW SERVICE TO ALLOW CONSUMERS OPEN ACCESS TO NETWORKS; AT&T ENTERS THE ON-LINE 
RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM and AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Telephone & Telegraph Co. on Thursday announced it is starting an 
on-line service that, for the first time, will give consumers access to 
electronic databases and other communications networks from any location and 
without a great deal of computer know-how. 
</P>
<P>
 The service, to be offered beginning this summer, will give AT&T entrance into 
the rapidly growing, $800-million market for on-line services now dominated by 
Prodigy, Compuserve and America Online. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly for AT&T, its new PersonaLink Services will help drive demand 
for database services, long-distance calls and portable communications devices 
-- all areas in which the big phone company is heavily involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is to have a database in your briefcase," said Rick Martin, research 
director at Chicago Corp. "You will have instantaneous access to data, no 
matter where you are and no matter what device you are using." 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T will have tough competition in the on-line field, however, since other 
major companies such as Apple Computer and Microsoft also plan to enter the 
business. It also faces technical challenges, as most wireless devices still 
lack the power to be effective terminals for tapping into on-line systems, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, AT&T's long-term success offering such services depends on its being 
guaranteed free access to the various communications lines, including cable, 
that have been strung into American homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the beginning -- it's going to evolve over five years," Martin 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Questions of access to communications lines may be one reason AT&T joined 
consumer groups Thursday in the fight to pressure the Clinton Administration to 
assure open access to all companies as it considers new regulations to spur 
development of a communications infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kavner, AT&T's chief of multimedia products and services, lashed out 
Thursday at what he called the cable industry's "closed-access, non-competitive 
model" for the Information Age during his keynote address at the Consumer 
Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe today's cable industry gate-keeping model would stifle commercial 
and creative potential if it were re-created in the new, interactive multimedia 
world," Kavner said. "The potential of interactive networks is not found in 500 
pre-programmed channels. The beauty is that consumers have the freedom to 
choose any subject or service from the intelligent terminal in their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 While content suppliers such as television producers must negotiate with a 
cable operator to get their programs aired, Kavner said, AT&T favors a model in 
which everyone has equal access to a broad communications network. 
</P>
<P>
 Kavner's speech, which appeared to mark a new level of aggressiveness for 
AT&T, comes a few days before Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to speak at a 
UCLA symposium on ensuring openness and accessibility to communications 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T cited PersonaLink, unveiled at the show, as an example of the kind of 
open services it espouses. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T's key advantage over other on-line systems will be the system's ability 
to be accessed by portable communications devices being offered by a growing 
number of electronics companies. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T said its first customers will be mobile professionals trying to keep in 
touch with their secretaries through electronic mail from portable 
communications devices. 
</P>
<P>
 The service makes it easier for customers to access computer networks by using 
a new software language developed by General Magic, a Mountain View, Calif., 
computer company jointly owned by such major electronics companies as AT&T, 
Apple and Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
 The software, which was released Thursday, allows AT&T to create "agents," or 
special packets of code, that enter a network and can search out and sift 
through vast amounts of information. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents can also take on relatively complex tasks. A busy executive could 
have a system programmed so that when his or her mother's birthday came along 
the agent could wake up, send a message of love and a bouquet of flowers, said 
Dan Rosen, an AT&T vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said AT&T's move could help establish a standard for wireless 
communications devices around the General Magic software Telescript. Motorola 
and Sony, partners in the General Magic alliance, have said they will introduce 
personal communications devices that use Telescript technology this year. 
</P>
<P>
 America Online and several wireless companies have also committed themselves 
to Telescript.

CALFED BOARD VETOES OFFER BY GOLDEN WEST; BANKING: BATTLE FOR TROUBLED THRIFT 
COULD INTENSIFY AS PRESSURE IS EXERTED ON ITS INVESTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The board of California Federal Bank in Los Angeles has unanimously rejected a 
merger proposal from Golden West Financial, parent of Oakland-based World 
Savings, saying a conditional offer of about $600 million was not high enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, Golden West Financial Chairman Herb Sandler met in New York late 
Thursday with major CalFed shareholders to discuss a possible tender offer, in 
an apparent attempt to circumvent CalFed's board. Results of the meeting could 
not be immediately learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West's overtures could be the opening skirmish in a major battle for 
control of CalFed, a troubled financial institution whose branch offices and 
deposits are attractive commodities in an industry consolidating at an 
accelerating pace.  
</P>
<P>
 If the two savings and loans did merge, they would create the second-largest 
thrift in the United States, with assets of more than $44 billion. World is 
currently the nation's third-largest thrift, with assets of $28.4 billion; 
CalFed has $15.7 billion in assets, making it the country's fifth-largest 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to CalFed's board dated Dec. 21, Golden West offered to pay book 
value of $21.50 a share for the company, minus adequate reserves for problem 
loans and expected losses in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Golden West estimated the offer was worth a maximum of about $625 
million, including $90 million for preferred shareholders. But with CalFed's 
expected loss of about $50 million in the fourth quarter and its bad loans 
subject to further write-offs, Golden West's final offer would have been closer 
to $575 million or even lower, CalFed officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 One high-level source at CalFed called the Golden West offer "amateur hour" 
and nowhere near what the board thinks the thrift is worth. CalFed officials 
were upset that the offer included no premium for the thrift's deposits or real 
estate that has been written down below market value. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandler called the meeting in New York in an attempt to prevail upon 10 
institutional investors, who control nearly 50% of CalFed's stock, to pressure 
the CalFed board into opening merger talks, sources said. Golden West 
officials, including Sandler, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 CalFed shares have risen in recent weeks on speculation that the thrift would 
either put itself up for sale or arrange a merger. CalFed shares rose $1.25 to 
close Thursday at $16.125 in New York Stock Exchange trading. Golden West 
shares rose 75 cents to $39.25. 
</P>
<P>
 World Savings is one of the only large S&Ls to emerge mostly unscathed from 
the industry debacle of the 1980s. Sandler and his wife, Marion, the company's 
president, consistently earn high marks from industry analysts for their 
efficient and disciplined management. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sandlers have a reputation for paying rock-bottom prices for acquisitions 
that have turned out to be big moneymakers, said Jonathan E. Gray, thrift 
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 CalFed is trying to right itself amid more than $800 million in problem loans. 
The company completed a $242-million restructuring in March and seemed to be on 
the road to recovery. But its losses in 1993 are likely to be about $140 
million, including $91 million lost in the first nine months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, CalFed announced a plan to sell its 43 Florida branches and 
raise up to $300 million through stock offerings.

MARKET BEAT: BOND FUNDS ARE LIKELY TO BECOME A DICEY PROPOSITION THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors in bond mutual funds collected healthy returns in 1993, as falling 
interest rates for much of the year boosted the value of older bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a taste of what might lie ahead, fund investors should focus on 
fourth-quarter results alone: A gradual rise in interest rates left many bond 
funds with net losses for the quarter. For that period, at least, money market 
funds would have been a better investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fourth-quarter turmoil, investors who sat in bond funds for all of 
'93 earned total returns of between 6% and 20%, according to fund-tracker 
Lipper Analytical Services in New York. Those returns handily beat the 2.6% 
average 1993 return on U.S. money market funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Total return counts both the interest earned (the yield) and the appreciation 
or depreciation of a fund's share price, which is a function of market interest 
rate moves. As rates fall, older, higher-yielding bonds are naturally worth 
more, which means fund investors' shares rise in value. 
</P>
<P>
 Because market interest rates have been mostly falling since 1989, bond 
investors have enjoyed spectacular total returns in recent years, and 
especially in 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 * The average fund that owns long-term U.S. government bonds posted a total 
return of 9.3% last year -- 6.4% of which was yield, the rest price 
appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term corporate bond funds, especially high-yield junk bond funds, 
generally performed better than U.S. government bond funds. Corporates' yields 
were higher, and the value of the bonds also appreciated more as market rates 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
 * Funds that own long-term tax-free municipal bonds also sported high 1993 
returns, as last summer's increase in federal income tax rates boosted demand 
for the bonds, adding to their price appreciation. The average long-term 
California muni fund had a total return of 12.6%, only 5.4% of which was yield. 
</P>
<P>
 But few Wall Streeters believe that those returns are likely to be repeated in 
1994. If interest rates continue to creep up with the stronger economy, the 
price appreciation that boosted bonds in 1993 will turn into price depreciation 
. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk for bond fund investors -- who now have $621 billion entrusted to the 
funds -- is that market rates move up so much that price depreciation more than 
negates any yield earned this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Though fund owners by now ought to fully understand this risk, many experts 
worry that bond investors have been lulled into a false sense of security by 
five years of falling interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a great lack of perception that bond (fund) prices can 
decline," says Glen King Parker, publisher of Income & Safety, a fund 
newsletter based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-quarter fund results, as noted in the accompanying chart, should serve 
as an early warning. For example, the average total return on U.S. government 
bond funds in the quarter was a negative 0.36%: Though investors earned 1.6% in 
interest for the quarter (one-fourth of the 6.4% annualized yield on the 
typical fund), that was effectively wiped out because the share value of the 
funds fell nearly 2% in the quarter, on average. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a fund pays out its yield regardless of fluctuations in share 
price. For buy-and-hold investors who simply need current income, it may not 
matter if higher interest rates send bond fund values lower this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, there are steps that fund investors can take to lessen their risk of 
loss from an upward turn in interest rates this year: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ladder" your portfolio. Investors who own long-term bond funds (which often 
own bonds maturing in 10 years or more) should spread some of that money into 
intermediate-term funds (which own five- to 10-year bonds) and shorter-term 
funds (which own one- to five-year bonds), says Michael Lipper, head of Lipper 
Analytical. 
</P>
<P>
 Intermediate-term and short-term bonds will drop less in value than long-term 
bonds if interest rates rise across the board, Lipper notes. Though you'll earn 
a lower yield on shorter-term funds, you're also lowering the risk of 
significant loss to your bond investment by diversifying among maturities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all major fund companies offer funds of varying maturities, so 
diversification is easy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider corporate and muni bonds. Many investors own U.S. government funds 
for their perceived safety. But if interest rates continue to rise in an 
expanding economy, Treasury securities may depreciate far faster than corporate 
and muni bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should corporate and muni bonds hold their value better than Treasuries? 
In the case of corporates, a stronger economy should bolster the finances of 
the companies behind the bonds. That makes high-yield corporate junk issues 
particularly attractive in 1994 -- at least for a portion of your bond 
investment -- even after their stellar returns in 1993, says Income & Safety's 
Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Muni bonds, meanwhile, should benefit as high-income investors pour more of 
their assets into tax-free investments, to offset higher tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Go with a general fund. Rather than hamstring yourself in a single bond 
category, ask your fund company if it offers a general fund -- one that can mix 
Treasury, corporate and even foreign bonds. That will automatically give you 
greater diversification in what is certain to be a dicey market in 1994. How 
Bond Funds Fared 
</P>
<P>
 Bond mutual fund owners enjoyed a third year of good returns in 1993. Bond 
yields were supplemented by share-prices appreciations as market interest rates 
fell. 
</P>
<P>

</P>

 Junk corporate: 19.3%

<P>
 California muni: 12.6

BLOCKBUSTER, VIACOM PRESS MERGER TALKS; ENTERTAINMENT: THE TWO COMPANIES HOPE 
TO REACH AGREEMENT IN TIME TO TOP QVC'S BID FOR PARAMOUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN and JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viacom Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment have entered into advanced merger 
discussions in hopes of topping QVC Network Inc.'s bid for Paramount 
Communications Inc., knowledgeable sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks mark a dramatic escalation in the five-month takeover battle for 
Paramount, which reaches a crucial stage today when rival tender offers are set 
to expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom and Blockbuster hope to reach a merger agreement, most likely through a 
stock swap, before today's midnight deadline, the sources said. The deal would 
enable Viacom-Blockbuster to make an all-cash offer to Paramount shareholders, 
who are wary of the uncertain value of the cash-and-stock combinations now on 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
 But one knowledgeable source said that unless Viacom and Blockbuster announce 
a higher offer, either coupled with a definitive merger agreement or cash 
infusion from Blockbuster, stockholders will probably begin tendering their 
shares to QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are running out of time," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the two companies reach a merger accord, they are expected to ask Paramount 
shareholders to delay tendering their shares until early next week, when they 
could come back with a revised bid for Paramount, the sources added. One 
hang-up in the talks was said to be the issue of control, since both companies 
are headed by strong-willed executives. 
</P>
<P>
 While his personal stake would be sharply reduced in the event of a merger 
with Blockbuster, Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone would remain in control. But 
given that Redstone needs Blockbuster's backing, the video giant's chief 
executive, H. Wayne Huizenga, is said to be demanding substantive concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Viacom and QVC have made cash tender offers for 51% of Paramount and 
propose using their own stock for the remaining 49%. As of Thursday, the QVC 
bid was valued at about $9.9 billion and Viacom's bid was valued at about $9.3 
billion. Based on those offers, Paramount's board has recommended the QVC bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Any change in Viacom's or QVC's bid would trigger a 10-day extension. It is 
not clear whether QVC would respond with yet another revised bid to top a 
Viacom-Blockbuster offer or bow out in what nearly all observers declare has 
become an overheated, ego-driven bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom and Blockbuster have been in negotiations all week about how the home 
video retail company might boost its investment so Viacom can raise its bid for 
Paramount. Blockbuster has already agreed to invest $600 million in Viacom as 
part of its battle for the entertainment company. Baby Bell Nynex Corp. has 
agreed to put up an additional $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A Blockbuster-Viacom merger, which The Times first reported as a possibility 
last week, would presumably give the two companies the financial wherewithal to 
top any rival bid for Paramount. It would also unite two entertainment 
powerhouses that have substantial interests in the coming age of interactive 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom's assets include MTV, VH-1, Showtime and substantial cable holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 As the nation's dominant video rental company -- its stores generate more 
revenue than its next 300 competitors combined -- Blockbuster is one of the 
entertainment industry's biggest cash generators. Earlier this year, Huizenga 
estimated it will generate $1 billion in cash flow through 1996 and $2 billion 
through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Blockbuster has long been criticized for being too slow to diversify 
from its main video rental business. Many in Hollywood believe the company must 
do that to avoid an inevitable day of reckoning when technological alternatives 
to video rentals become available. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination with Viacom seemingly would allow Huizenga to confront 
Blockbuster's technological bogyman head-on, giving him time to make a 
transition and putting Blockbuster's huge cash machine to work while video 
renting remains a booming business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster's cash and expanded bank credit -- it recently tripled the size of 
its credit agreement to $1 billion -- would also provide powerful ammunition in 
a higher bid for Paramount. In addition, the two companies combined would not 
be as highly leveraged as Viacom would be by itself, easing concerns of 
bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 The tense negotiations have reportedly been moving in fits and starts all 
week.  
</P>
<P>
 Sources said it is hard to envision Redstone, 70, and Huizenga, 56, working 
side-by-side, suggesting that a succession plan would have to be clearly 
spelled out.  
</P>
<P>
 Paramount shares added 25 cents Thursday to close at $78.50 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Viacom Class A lost 87.5 cents to $47 and Viacom Class B fell 
75 cents to $42.75 on the American Stock Exchange. QVC slid $1 to $39.50 and 
Blockbuster added 12.5 cents to $29.875 on the NYSE. The Companies at a Glance

 400 Helicopter Workers Face Layoff: McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s helicopter plant 
in Culver City will end production by June, and only 50 to 100 of the plant's 
500 workers will be offered transfers to the helicopter division's headquarters 
in Mesa, Ariz., a spokesman said. More than 3,000 people worked at the plant in 
the mid-1980s, but its employment has steadily fallen due to defense cuts and 
McDonnell's previously announced plans to shift the plant's workload to Mesa. 
The plant is the former home of Hughes Helicopters, which McDonnell Douglas 
bought in 1984.

 Top Execs Rewarded by Rockwell: Rockwell International Corp. gave its top five 
executives nearly $8 million in "long-term compensation" for fiscal 1993 after 
not awarding them any such payments the previous year, the company's latest 
proxy statement shows. Donald R. Beall, chairman of the Seal Beach-based maker 
of automotive, aerospace and industrial goods, was awarded $3.5 million -- 
along with options covering 240,000 Rockwell common shares -- in long-term 
compensation for Rockwell's fiscal year ended Sept. 30.The payout was in 
addition to Beall's 1993 salary of $815,000 and a bonus for that year of 
$900,000. In fiscal 1993, Rockwell's profit rose 16% to $562 million, from $483 
million, excluding a onetime charge, the previous year. During the three years 
ended Sept. 30, Rockwell eliminated 10,000 jobs.

 Judge Rules in Hendrix Case: A federal district judge in Seattle ruled that 
MCA Music Entertainment cannot move ahead with its planned multimillion-dollar 
purchase of Jimi Hendrix's recording and publishing copyrights until a lawsuit 
filed by the late rock star's father is resolved. The 8-month-old fraud 
litigation, which does not name MCA as a defendant, accuses Los Angeles 
entertainment attorney Leo Branton and several corporations of selling the 
rights to the psychedelic guitarist's catalogue without the knowledge or 
consent of the father, James (Al) Hendrix.

 Arco Sues ARB Over Diesel Fuel Enforcement: Atlantic Richfield Co. filed suit 
in Los Angeles County Superior Court against the state Air Resources Board for 
failure to enforce its own clean-diesel fuel rule, which took effect Oct. 1. In 
August, fearing shortages of the new fuel -- designed to reduce emissions of 
soot-like particles and other pollutants -- the board extended the deadline for 
Chevron Corp., Unocal Corp. and Ultramar Inc. to produce the cleaner fuel.Arco 
had already invested $70 million to modify its Los Angeles refinery to make the 
new fuel and met the deadline. Arco called the ARB decision a "capricious 
relaxation" of the rule, first issued in 1988, and has sued in part to stop any 
further extensions to other refiners.

mortgages rose to 7.23% this week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
said.The average was up from 7.13% the previous week but still below 7.31% at 
the end of November. The average hit a 25-year low of 6.74% in October, but it 
has been above 7% for the last 10 weeks. On one-year, adjustable-rate 
mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 4.23%, up from 4.20% 
last week. Fifteen-year notes, an increasingly popular option for people 
refinancing their mortgages, averaged 6.74% this week, up from 6.63% a week 
earlier. The rates do not include add-on fees known as points.

 Economists Unfazed by Surge in Jobless Claims: The number of Americans 
applying for first-time unemployment benefits rose by 70,000 last week, but 
economists saw no cause for concern over the long-term job outlook. While the 
Labor Department's report reflects continuing instability of the nation's job 
market, economists said it should not be taken too seriously because government 
statisticians have difficulty adjusting claims during holiday weeks.The latest 
reporting period occurred between Christmas and New Year's. The increase was 
the steepest since July, 1992. For the week ended Dec. 25, California 
registered 5,234 fewer initial jobless claims, the biggest decline among 
states. The numbers for both emergency claims and individual state claims lag 
behind the initial jobless claims report by a week.

DECEMBER SALES SHOW A TREND TO CONSERVATIVE SHOPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sears, Roebuck & Co. and J.C. Penney were among the big winners of the holiday 
sales derby, as consumers sought bargains and products for the home, according 
to December reports released Thursday by major retailers.  
</P>
<P>
 Interest in home furnishings and consumer electronics hurt specialty apparel 
stores, but discounters benefited less from bargain hunting than in recent 
years, as people were attracted to the broader selections at department stores 
offering moderate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "December sales show that Americans are becoming extremely frugal and 
conservative," said Kurt Barnard, a New York-based retail economist. "Consumers 
would like to buy nice merchandise but don't want to spend much. And 
discounters don't have the full array of merchandise. Sears and J.C. Penney 
were the big winners." 
</P>
<P>
 Penney's same-store sales -- revenue from stores open at least 12 months -- 
rose 10% last month compared to December, 1992. Sales at Sears climbed 13.3% 
for the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other department store chains -- particularly those that rely on apparel 
sales -- saw only moderate increases during the month. For example, St. 
Louis-based May Department Stores, which operates the Robinsons-May chain, saw 
an increase of 4.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores -- owner of Bloomingdale's and 
other chains -- saw a 4.8% improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The same-store sales increase at Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores 
-- operator of the Broadway -- was a modest 2.3%, which was good enough to 
please David Dworkin, the company's president.  
</P>
<P>
 "The performance was better than our expectations," Dworkin said. "We were 
expecting sales to be flat." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, sales in California were up slightly from the previous December. 
Other chains prominent in the state, such as Target and Mervyn's, reported that 
sales exceeded their low expectations. Sales at Target and Mervyn's stores in 
California were up moderately compared to December, 1992, said Ann Barkelew, 
spokeswoman for Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. Target sales were up 6%, 
but Mervyn's, which relies more heavily on apparel sales, saw its same-store 
sales total fall 4% nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Limited, which had a same-store sales decline of 1%, was among the many 
specialty apparel retailers that struggled in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Others that saw declines were Clothestime, down 4%; Ross Stores, 3%, and Ann 
Taylor, 2.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-price discount chains realized small increases. Wal-Mart had a 4% increase 
and Kmart had a 1.1% rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, sales were up an estimated 4% nationwide from December, 1992.

DOW BREAKS THROUGH 3,800 TO ANOTHER RECORD; YIELDS FALL 
</P>

<P>
 Market Overview * A burst of buying in blue-chip stocks propelled the Dow 
Jones industrials through the 3,800 barrier to another record close Thursday, 
but the market overall gave an uninspiring performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong stocks suffered deep profit taking, and the selloff continued early 
today, spreading to other Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields slid after Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich suggested that 
today's December employment report may be less robust than market expectations. 
Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow closed up 5.06 points to 3,803.88, a new high and the first close over 
3,800. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dow was boosted by a handful of heavy-industry stocks. The broad 
market, in contrast, looked relatively weak: Winners just slightly edged losers 
on the New York Stock Exchange, though trading volume remained heavy at 368 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks rose 2.36 points to 
780.41, and winners topped losers by 14 to 12 -- a better showing than the 
NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the Dow's slow push to new highs reflects investors' increasing 
skittishness about overpaying for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interesting thing about the market was that it was such a mixed bag 
today. It reflects a very selective market which emphasizes cyclical stocks 
that benefit from an improving economy," said Michael Metz, analyst at 
brokerage Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the market's ability to advance this week is a bullish sign for the 
year, some analysts contend: The market's direction in the first week of 
January, and in January overall, often tells whether stocks will have an up or 
down year. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, that barometer is signaling a rough year in the Hong Kong market: The 
Hang Seng index plummeted 792.5 points, or 6.5%, Thursday to 11,374.5, as 
profit takers hit the market after its extraordinary rally in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The selloff continued today: The Hang Seng was off 676.55 points, or 6%, to 
10,697.95 at midday. "It is a question of altitude sickness," said Nial 
Gooding, an associate director at Barclays de Zoete Wedd (Asia). "It takes a 
while to adjust to the rises, and people are being a bit queasy up here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hong Kong selling spilled into other recently hot Asian markets. In 
late-morning trading today, Singapore shares were off 3.4% and Kuala Lumpur 
shares were down 4.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks continuing to gain on optimism about the economy included 
Allied Signal, up 1 to 77 1/2; Bethlehem Steel, up 1/2 to 20 1/2; Kodak, up 3/4 
to 46 3/8; GE, up 7/8 to 103 7/8; Varity, up 1 1/2 to 45 7/8, and Kennametal, 
up 2 1/4 to 45 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transportation stocks followed industrials higher. Burlington Northern 
gained 1 3/4 to 58 3/4, Conrail jumped 1 3/8 to 67 3/4, Federal Express surged 
1 5/8 to 72 1/2 and Union Pacific was up 1 3/4 to 66 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many technology issues rallied, led by software firm Adobe Systems, after it 
said earnings nearly doubled in the recent quarter. Adobe surged 4 to 26 1/2, 
Hewlett-Packard gained 2 3/8 to 81 5/8, Microsoft rose 2 3/8 to 84 5/8, Lotus 
added 1 1/8 to 58 1/8 and BMC Software shot up 4 1/4 to 52 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retail stocks were mixed, reacting to December sales reports. Dayton Hudson 
rose 1 to 68 3/8, Gap gained 3 1/8 to 41 1/2 and Limited added 7/8 to 18, but 
Nordstrom eased 5/8 to 32 1/4 and Wal-Mart stumbled 7/8 to 24 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Utilities were broadly lower for a second day. Texas Utilities fell 2 1/4 to 
40 3/8 after it was downgraded by brokerage Kidder Peabody. The Dow utility 
index sank 1.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Copley Pharmaceutical sank 8 at 29 1/2 after it warned of a heavy financial 
impact from a drug recall. 
</P>
<P>
 In other foreign markets, Mexico City's Bolsa index closed at a new high in a 
volatile session, up 26.86 points to 2,684.17. 
</P>
<P>
 Markets also gained ground in London, Paris and Tokyo. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Reich's downbeat comments regarding the December jobs report 
due today surprised many economists who had forecast a big jump in employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Labor Department officials said Reich could not know what the actual 
figures are and was just making an estimate, traders bought bonds on the 
expectation that slower job growth will allay concerns that the economy might 
overheat in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds was at 6.34%, down from 
Wednesday's 6.40%. In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold for current delivery fell $1.90 to $389.20 an ounce on the Comex. But 
silver bounced up 5.4 cents to $5.11. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar closed in New York at 112.65 Japanese yen, down from Wednesday's 
112.90, and at 1.745 German marks, up from 1.741. 
</P>
<P>
 * February crude oil futures inched up 8 cents to $15.42 a barrel, the fourth 
straight daily gain.

CIRCUIT CITY PLANS NEW PUSH IN PRICE WAR; RETAIL: ELECTRONICS WILL GET CHEAPER 
AS COMPETITORS FOLLOW SUIT. STOCK PRICES REFLECT FEARS OF THINNING INDUSTRY 
PROFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An escalation of the price war among consumer electronics retailers loomed 
Thursday, after Circuit City Stores Inc. said it plans to slash prices and 
boost promotions in major markets nationwide in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Circuit City's main competitors in Southern California vowed to 
match or beat the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest consumer electronics retailer said it will begin the 
program, aimed at increasing its market share, by early March. Also, the 
company said it will continue with plans to open 180 new stores in the next 
three years, adding perhaps three stores this year in Southern California 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But Circuit City appears to be facing a tough fight, especially in the highly 
competitive Southland market. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Circuit City lowers its prices, we would respond to the cuts," said Robert 
Gunst, president and chief executive of Good Guys Inc. in San Francisco. "We 
would not allow our prices to be higher than a competitor's." Gunst said Good 
Guys hopes to open 10 to 12 new locations in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Best Buy Co., Circuit City's main rival, appears poised to enter 
the Los Angeles area with new stores. A spokeswoman said the Minneapolis-based 
company, which operates primarily in the Midwest, is considering California in 
its plan for adding 40 stores this year. 
</P>
<P>
 While buyers of stereo sets and VCRs stand to benefit from the stiff 
competition, investors concerned about the industry's ability to turn a profit 
triggered a slide Thursday in the stock prices of consumer electronics 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit City, citing its aggressive expansion plans, predicted its earnings 
will be flat in 1994. The price of Circuit City shares fell $4.50 to close at 
$17.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The weakness in Circuit City's stock also caused a $7.50 plunge in Best Buy's 
shares to $39.75 on the NYSE. In Nasdaq trading, Good Guys stock lost $1.50 to 
close at $12 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 All three companies announced improved sales for December. Circuit City said 
its same-store sales -- those at stores open at least a year -- rose 8%. Its 
total sales were $713.8 million for the month, up 25% from December, 1992. Best 
Buy said its same-store sales were up 38%. And Good Guys saw sales at stores 
open for a year or longer jump 12% from the year-ago period, to $211 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Circuit City and Best Buy are locked in a bitter battle in 
Chicago, St. Louis, Ft. Worth and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will continue this fight for market domination until somebody cries 
uncle," said Monroe H. Greenstein, an analyst at Lazard Freres in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller chains may become the first casualties in the fight between the two 
big competitors, analysts said. In Southern California, Leo's Stereo has gone 
out of business and Philadelphia-based Silo reportedly plans a major 
retrenchment. Silo officials denied reports that it will close all of its 
Southern California stores, but it would not comment further.

NEW AIR BOARD CHAIRWOMAN BACKS CLEAN-CAR DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacqueline E. Schafer, the new chairwoman of the state Air Resources Board, 
said Thursday that she supports keeping California's electric car mandate. It 
was her first public comment on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Her view runs counter to the hopes of big U.S. auto makers, who want to 
overturn an ARB rule requiring them to make available in California 
zero-emissions vehicles -- almost certain to be electric cars -- beginning in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a bias toward retaining the (zero-emissions) rule for a simple 
reason," Schafer said. "It has generated the production of a whole new set of 
incentives (and) technology applications for transportation systems that will 
serve us well into the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 She added that the auto industry "is not a monolith" and that many 
entrepreneurs are working on electric car development. 
</P>
<P>
 Schafer said she has yet to hear the auto makers' specific objections to the 
mandate but expects to as the next biennial review of the rule takes place 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three U.S. auto makers contend that even the best experimental 
batteries are inefficient and too costly to compete with the gasoline fuel 
system and that they will have to raise the prices of all their cars to pay for 
the manufacture of electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Assemblyman Bernie Richter (R-Chico) confirmed Thursday that he has 
drafted legislation to lift the ARB mandate. The bill, which Richter said he 
will introduce in the Assembly early next week, would suspend the rule until 
battery technology is able to meet criteria he solicited from the big U.S. auto 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Schafer commented on the rule during a luncheon preceding the 1994 Los Angeles 
Auto Show, which has a theme of "The Automobile and the Environment." She was 
there to certify the first "ultra-low-emission vehicle," a Chrysler minivan 
that runs on compressed natural gas. The ultra-low-emissions requirement, like 
the zero-emission rule, is part of the larger ARB plan for reducing air 
pollution from vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson in November named Schafer to replace Jananne Sharpless, 
another supporter of the mandate, which has been a target of lobbyists for the 
big auto manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton, in accepting the certification from Schafer, 
questioned whether there is a market for cleaner-burning cars. He said that 
while "it's clearly in society's interest to reduce emissions, most consumers 
don't have that same interest."

MOST-STOLEN CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year's hottest car? A Porsche? Mercedes? Lexus? Toyota Camry? Ford 
Taurus? Believe it or not, the most-stolen car of 1993 was your father's 
Oldsmobile. The 1984 Cutlass Supreme placed No. 1.General Motors Corp. products 
filled every Top 10 slot in the list compiled by CCC Information Services Inc. 
of Chicago, which does vehicle valuations for the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 While there will always be joy riders, it's not the racing stripes that make 
the model popular with thieves. The interchangeability of its parts is the 
"single most overriding reason" the Cutlass is stolen so often, said William 
Geen, senior vice president of CCC Information Services. "The used-parts 
business remains the big business."

 '93 Was 'Turnaround' Year for GM: Chief Executive John Smith said the auto 
maker earned its first profit in four years in 1993 and that he expects an even 
stronger 1994."It was a good year for GM," Smith said. "It was a turnaround 
year for our North American operations. GM returned to profitability . . . and 
1994 looks strong." He declined to say how much General Motors Corp. earned 
last year, but through the first nine months the company had a profit of $1.3 
billion, virtually assuring that it would end the year in the black for the 
first time since 1989, when it earned $4.2 billion.

 Magnetek Will Restructure, Divest 6 Non-Core Units: The troubled Los Angeles 
manufacturer of electrical equipment said its board has approved a plan to shed 
operations that now account for about 29% of its revenue. The restructuring 
will bring a second-quarter charge of not more than $60 million, the company 
said. Magnetek Inc., which grew dramatically in large part from sales of 
energy-efficient fluorescent lighting ballasts, reported a loss of $40.4 
million, or $1.65 a share, on sales of $372 million for the second quarter 
ended Dec. 31, 1992.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: LONG-DISTANCE 'SLAMS' ON THE RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christine Layer was surprised to receive a telephone bill listing a company 
named LDDS as her long-distance carrier. An MCI customer, Layer hadn't ordered 
a switch to LDDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marina del Rey resident had been "slammed" -- switched to a long-distance 
company without her permission. Government regulators say complaints about 
slamming are rising despite 1 1/2-year-old rules intended to protect consumers 
from unauthorized switches. During the first 10 months of 1993, complaints 
about slamming jumped 64%, according to the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff is very concerned about it," said Robert Spangler, deputy chief of 
the FCC's informal-complaints branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Under FCC rules, a company selling long-distance service over the phone must 
take one of the following steps: 
</P>
<P>
 * Get your written consent to switch. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have a third party call you to verify your switch. 
</P>
<P>
 * Send you a letter telling you about the switch and how you can refuse it if 
you don't want to switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Spangler said a review of complaints shows that some lesser-known 
long-distance companies are skirting the rules. In some cases, he said, 
long-distance companies are getting verification from children. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Spangler said, long-distance companies are enticing people to switch 
with sweepstakes entries that double as long-distance order forms. Contest 
entrants failing to read the solicitations have unwittingly ordered new 
long-distance service, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spangler said the FCC has asked one company using the sweepstakes pitch, 
Texas-based Matrix Telecommunications, to alter its solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the companies involved, Layer's problem resulted from an error on 
the part of LDDS. The tiny, Washington-based company mistakenly listed Layer's 
number under the name of a corporate customer. After she complained, Layer's 
service was switched back to MCI at no charge, as required by federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think you've been slammed, contact your local phone company and tell 
them you did not order service from the new company and you want "change 
charges" suspended while they investigate the unauthorized switch. Then call 
the long-distance company you were switched away from and ask to be 
reconnected. There should be no charge for the reconnection. You can also 
complain to the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent being slammed, you can file a document with your local phone 
company telling them you want to be notified if they receive an order to switch 
your long-distance service. Known as a primary interchange carrier restriction 
form, the document is available from your local phone company. Layer has filed 
one with GTE. 
</P>

 Milking the consumer? The state-approved increase in what dairy farmers get 
paid for milk is showing up in supermarket dairy cases, again stirring 
controversy over retail milk prices. 
</P>
<P>
 An informal survey shows that the price of a gallon of whole milk in Los 
Angeles has risen by as much as 30 cents since November, twice the 15 
cents-a-gallon jump in raw milk prices approved by the state Department of Food 
and Agriculture two months ago. While raw milk prices are regulated, retail 
prices are not. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Goold, vice president of Western United Dairymen in Modesto, said 
supermarkets are using the raw milk price hike as an "opportunity to take 
higher profits." Along with consumer organizations, dairy farmers have 
maintained that milk is among the most profitable items in the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union is calling for a state investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why a law enforcement officer, like (state Atty. Gen.) Dan 
Lundgren, isn't looking into this parallel pricing on the part of supermarket 
chains," said Harry Snyder, co-director of Consumers Union's San Francisco 
office.  
</P>
<P>
 Parallel pricing means that merchants adjust prices to match competitors; it 
does not in itself mean anti-competitive activity has taken place. Lundgren's 
office did not respond to a request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Dairy Institute, an organization representing many of the 
supermarkets that process milk, said he could not comment on price changes at 
individual stores. But Craig Alexander, the Dairy Institute's executive 
director, said that overall food prices are rising more rapidly than milk 
prices.  
</P>
<P>
 Citing BLS statistics for the country as a whole, Alexander said food prices 
have increased 42.7% over the last decade, while whole milk prices have risen 
29.5%. "I would say that milk is still a good value for the consumer," he said.

TRILOGY GROUP STRIKES DEAL WITH MAJOR EUROPE FILM DISTRIBUTOR; MOVIES: THE 
THREE-YEAR PACT WITH LONDON-BASED MAJESTIC COULD BE A LUCRATIVE ONE FOR THE 
DEVELOPER OF 'ROBIN HOOD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trilogy Entertainment Group, best known for developing "Robin Hood: Prince of 
Thieves" and "Backdraft," has struck a potentially lucrative deal with 
London-based Majestic Films. 
</P>
<P>
 Trilogy said Thursday that Majestic will help to finance certain productions 
in return for foreign distribution rights. The three-year deal puts Trilogy in 
partnership with one of Europe's most established distributors. Majestic is 
majority-owned by the Italian publishing giant RCS. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our history, we've generated most of our own ideas," Trilogy partner 
Richard Lewis said. "Now we have a chance to step out more on our own. This 
gives us that freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is a result of Trilogy's long-running efforts to gain a bigger stake 
in its films, which have performed well overseas. Under the terms of the 
agreement, Trilogy will be guaranteed a percentage of the returns from 
international markets. Majestic is also expected to help Trilogy acquire rights 
to major books and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said the companies already have five projects in development, two of 
which would be domestically distributed by MGM/UA. Trilogy is in the process of 
moving its offices from Columbia Pictures to MGM/UA, where it has a long-term 
first-look deal. It recently completed production on "Blown Away," starring 
Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones, for MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and his partners, Pen Densham and John Watson, got their big break in 
the summer of 1991, when "Robin Hood" and "Backdraft" were released. The 
company subsequently produced the CBS television series "Space Rangers," which 
was canceled soon after its premiere last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Majestic deal creates a revolving fund for Trilogy to use in the 
development of star-driven movies in the mold of "Robin Hood." Majestic's Guy 
East said his company is looking to finance "big locomotive features" in 
conjunction with the major studios. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trilogy partnership could produce as many as three films a year, according 
to East. "We'll start with a number of projects immediately," he said. "We find 
(Trilogy) very easy to get along with. Their track record is good. The kind of 
films they make is the kind we like." 
</P>
<P>
 Majestic in the past has internationally distributed such films as "Dances 
With Wolves," "Driving Miss Daisy" and "Damage." Lewis said MGM/UA will retain 
worldwide rights to "Blown Away." In the future, Lewis said, MGM/UA will most 
likely be the domestic distributor on the majority of projects done in 
partnership with Majestic.

THE BIZ: EXECS EXIT SCENE AS PARAMOUNT SALE LOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its parent company at the center of a takeover war that's raged for 
nearly five months, the executive floodgates appear to be opening at Paramount 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Gelfan, the veteran head of business affairs for the studio's Motion 
Picture Group, on Thursday confirmed reports that he is leaving to become 
executive vice president of business and legal affairs at 20th Century Fox, in 
a management reorganization at that studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other Paramount executives, including theatrical exhibition group 
president Larry Gleason, have recently resigned to accept jobs at MGM/UA. While 
that partly reflects loyalty to former Paramount Chairman Frank Mancuso, who 
now heads MGM/UA, sources say senior Paramount executives have become steadily 
more restless as the parent company's sale nears. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelfan, a 10-year studio veteran who is known as one of the industry's 
toughest negotiators, is the most high-profile executive to leave the studio in 
recent weeks. Sources say he became frustrated by management turnover at the 
studio, which has had three chairmen in four years, and by the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount, for its part, attributes the move to the usual corporate turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelfan's transfer to 20th Century Fox was orchestrated by Bill Mechanic, who 
recently left Disney to become Fox's president. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of Bill's intent to mold the studio more in the model of places 
from which he came -- Disney and Paramount," said one source. "And Greg 
(Gelfan) is a very logical candidate. He has spent his whole career on the 
studio side." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox formally confirmed the hiring late Thursday as word quickly spread through 
the usual gossip channels. In a statement, Mechanic said Gelfan is being 
brought in to help accommodate "increased production." Fox has said it plans to 
raise the number of movies it makes each year from 14 to as many as 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelfan, 43, will oversee both the legal and business affairs departments in 
his new job, which begins next month, and will report directly to Mechanic and 
Fox Chairman Peter Chernin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an exciting opportunity," Gelfan said Thursday. "It's a company that 
really seems to be moving ahead, and they are some great people to work with." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount executives say privately that Gelfan's move was expected since he 
made no effort to renegotiate his contract, which expires in eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading candidate to replace him is Richard Fowkes, Paramount's senior 
vice president of business affairs and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say they expect a decision within a week. At Fox, meanwhile, news of 
Gelfan's imminent arrival stirred fears of further upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 Melinda Benedek, executive vice president of business affairs, and Lyman 
Gronemeyer, executive vice president of legal affairs, were apparently told 
this week that they will be reporting to Gelfan. 
</P>
<P>
 While both have been encouraged to stay on, people close to the studio say 
Gelfan's coming aboard is largely viewed as a move by Chernin and Mechanic to 
put their own man in place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Benedek and Gronemeyer both predate the Chernin regime. Ironically, Benedek 
was recently listed among the most powerful and respected women in Hollywood by 
the American Lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just part of an ongoing effort to get rid of the Joe Roth people," 
said one source, referring to Chernin's predecessor at Fox, who is now an 
independent producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Market share mania: Last week's column, in which Sony Pictures Chairman Peter 
Guber challenged the distributor-based market share system, got a real rise out 
of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber said market share should be based on a company's combined domestic 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, he said Sony had the lead, with a 19.2% "corporate" market share 
among its four divisions -- Columbia Pictures, Tristar Pictures, Triumph 
Releasing and Sony Classics. 
</P>
<P>
 The first rebuttal came from Disney, which said its corporate market share was 
even higher -- 19.5% -- when revenue from its Miramax Films division was added 
to the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Warner Bros. weighed in with a forceful rejection of both companies' 
arguments. Warner defended the existing system, noting that its single 
distribution company had outperformed all competitors by pulling in 18.7% of 
the domestic returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter agreed, this week awarding Warner the 
box office crown for the third year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 More trouble: After excluding Hollywood from the GATT agreement, the 
protectionist-minded Europeans appear to be moving to keep their momentum 
alive. On Thursday, Greek Minister for Culture and former film star Melina 
Mercouri was quoted as saying she would fight Hollywood's dominance of European 
cinema in her new role as leader of European Union culture ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 King of All Media update: Main Events Television, which distributed the "Miss 
Howard Stern New Year's Eve Pageant," now estimates that the raunchy 
pay-per-view program reached about 400,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
 That puts it far ahead of the previous entertainment champ for pay-per-view, a 
1991 New Kids on the Block concert. While the figures are preliminary, 400,000 
homes would bring in gross revenue of more than $15 million. As much as $5 
million could go directly to Stern.

SPIELBERG GOES SHOPPING AT ELECTRONICS SHOW FOR EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE FIRM HE 
CAN DIRECT 
</P>

 Wearing a brown leather bomber jacket and his trademark baseball cap, director 
Steven Spielberg paid a high-profile visit to the Consumer Electronics Show on 
Thursday, touring the exhibits and sampling the newest video games, including 
the interactive version of his hit movie "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg said his Amblin Entertainment is interested in purchasing a small 
educational multimedia software developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's all sorts of possibilities in education to use this technology to 
make it more fun," Spielberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg had a hard time repressing his directorial instincts at the show, 
telling one programmer he should put a 1940s show tune soundtrack in an 
off-road racing game and opining to AT&T multimedia chief Robert Kavner that 
the best games are the ones with "good stories." MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman 
and President Sidney J. Sheinberg, who accompanied Spielberg on the tour, were 
less impressed. "This is high-tech?" said Wasserman, confronted with a pinball 
video game boasting sophisticated graphics and animation. "It has its place," 
Sheinberg said. "But there are still an awful lot of us that like to go home at 
night and not interact with our movies."

EXECUTIVE SUITE: MCA TO INCREASE RESPONSIBILITIES OF AL TELLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MCA Music Entertainment Group Chairman Al Teller will get additional 
responsibilities with corporate parent MCA Inc., sources close to the company 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is viewed partly as a reward for what is expected to be a record year 
for the music company in 1993, as well as a reflection of Teller's increasing 
role at MCA in areas such as technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources speculated that there will be an additional title for for Teller -- 
who will continue to oversee music -- probably as an MCA executive vice 
president. Teller is credited with a successful gamble on the surprise career 
revival of singer Meat Loaf, whose "Bat Out of Hell II" album turned out to be 
MCA's biggest seller last year.

BRIEFCASE: BANKING; OFF REGULATORY HOOK, LANDMARK BANK SEES HAPPIER DAYS AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer

 Executives at Landmark Bank were surprised and a little miffed a year ago when 
federal regulators took the drastic step of imposing a severe order requiring 
the bank to fix various problems. The executives thought the problems had 
already been fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, though Regulators lifted the order in eight months -- one of the 
fastest turnabouts yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Now free of various restrictions, Landmark is concentrating on earning money 
again, said Craig D. Collette, the bank's president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're cooking," he said, beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Collette expects that fourth-quarter earnings, after an ongoing audit, will 
equal the $330,000 earned for the first six months of 1993. And with about $208 
million in loans and other assets at the end of December, the bank is looking 
for some growth this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Landmark was hurt in late 1991 by an employee's unauthorized loans, which cost 
the bank $2 million. The bank recovered $1.3 million from its insurance 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 But then regulators, worried about the lingering Southern California 
recession, ordered that the values of some loans backed by real estate be 
written down. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank spent 1992 and early 1993 cleaning up its books, and it is now 
benefiting from having taken a conservative approach. Many questionable loans 
were paid off, and the higher reserves the bank had socked away for possible 
losses turned into gains of about $1.1 million, Collette said. 
</P>
<P>
 "1994 is going to be great," he said. "At least we will be sleeping well at 
night and smiling during the day."

 Craig McCallum Named President of Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * Craig McCallum has been appointed president and chief operating officer of 
Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
 As president, McCallum, 48, will be responsible for all commercial and 
residential development in planned communities such as 10,000-acre Mission 
Viejo and 6,600-acre Aliso Viejo and the 22,000-acre Highlands Ranch project in 
Colorado, said James G. Gilleran, chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, McCallum was president of Mission Viejo Co.'s Colorado 
division. His affiliation with the development company began in 1973, when he 
was a planner with the engineering firm of Raub, Bein Frost and Associates, a 
portion of which was acquired by Mission Viejo Co. Before that, he worked in 
the planning department of Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 With 8,600 homes and 19,000 residents now, Aliso Viejo is expected to have 
20,000 units and 48,000 residents when completed in 2005, a company spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Viejo planned community now has 26,500 units and 75,700 residents, 
she said, and is expected to have about 30,400 dwelling units for a population 
of about 90,000 when it completes its 30-year plan in 1996.

BRIEFCASE: BANKING; RIGHTS OFFERINGS SOUGHT 
</P>

<P>
 Last year, a number of troubled savings and loan companies such as UnionFed 
Financial Corp. in Brea kept regulators at bay by raising much-needed cash 
through stock sales. Now a number of Orange County's small community banks want 
to tap that pool. 
</P>
<P>
 CommerceBancorp in Newport Beach and Pioneer Bancorp in Fullerton are seeking 
federal approval for rights offerings, which give current shareholders the 
right to purchase new stock before the companies offer shares to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are troubled banks desperately in need of cash, and at least six other 
county banks are waiting to see how successful CommerceBancorp and Pioneer are 
before going forward with their own plans to raise money, said Edward E. 
Schmidt, a co-director of the Findley Group, banking consultants in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale E. Walter, president of CommerceBancorp, said he hopes to get a 
$15-million rights offering to shareholders and the public in March. In one of 
three measures for adequate capital, the final reserve against losses, the 
company's CommerceBank unit is "significantly undercapitalized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to have to be a considerable amount of recapitalization in the 
industry down here," said Jeff Gottfredson, an industry analyst at Cruttenden & 
Co. in Newport Beach. "They're all under the gun to raise money -- or consider 
getting out of the banking business." 
</P>
<P>
 For shareholders of severely troubled banks, that means they almost have to 
accept huge reductions in the percentages of stock they own, or face being 
wiped out by a federal takeover.

LOCAL TOURISM SEES A SLIGHT GAIN IN 1993; INDUSTRY: THE NUMBER OF TOURISTS 
REACHES 37.8 MILLION, UP FROM 37.7 MILLION, WHILE ATTENDANCE BY CONVENTIONEERS 
DROPS 7%, ACCORDING TO THE ANAHEIM AREA VISITOR & CONVENTION BUREAU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County's tourism industry, flat for two years, barely moved again last 
year as 37.8 million people visited the county, according to the Anaheim Area 
Visitor & Convention Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Convention attendance, though, slumped 7% to 950,916 visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given our current national economic downturns during the past two to three 
years, our region is actually doing pretty well," said Elaine Cali, a 
spokeswoman for the bureau. "We are still considered a premier convention and 
tourism destination." 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding such optimism, the hotel industry is hoping this will be a 
better year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Hilton and Towers, Southern California's largest hotel, with 1,600 
rooms, struggled last year to maintain its level of occupancy by garnering such 
new business as booking rooms for several professional sports teams, said hotel 
spokesman Patrick Hynes. 
</P>
<P>
 But 1994 already is looking better. "We have a number of conventions on the 
books for 1994," he said, "and when we see a good convention year, we normally 
see a pickup in tourism." 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance fell somewhat at the county's two major amusement parks, Disneyland 
and Knott's Berry Farm. But Knott's had more customers in the last three months 
of the year than it did in 1992's final quarter, said park spokesman Bob 
Ochsner. He would not disclose the percentage increase except to say it was 
"double digits." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very pleased with the fourth quarter and expect a very strong new 
year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the number of tourists visiting the county barely changed, remaining 
significantly lower than the peak year of 1990 when the county was host to 38.4 
million tourists. The county had about 37.7 million visitors in 1992 and about 
37.8 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cali said that the county continued to attract large conventions in 1993, such 
as the National Assn. of Music Merchants and the National Electronic Packaging 
and Production Conference, which brought in 45,000 and 37,700 visitors, 
respectively. Tourism Remains Slow 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism in Orange County last year remained virtually unchanged from 1992 and 
has been flat since 1990, when it reached a five-year high of 38.4 million 
visitors. Convention attendance last year dipped below 1 million after hovering 
around that level since 1989. Tourism and convention attendance, in millions: 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists 1989: 35.0 1990: 38.4 1991: 37.8 1992: 37.7 1993: 37.8 
</P>
<P>
 Conventioneers 1989: 1.1 1990: 1.0 1991: 1.1 1992: 1.0 1993: 0.9

MACY'S CHIEF TELLS OF REJECTING OFFERS OF ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Myron Ullman, chairman of R.H. Macy & Co., told some of the company's 
unsecured creditors Thursday that other retailers have offered Macy advice on 
how to develop a reorganization plan to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman made his comments during regularly scheduled discussions about the 
status of the company's reorganization efforts, sources said.There was 
heightened interest in the discussions in the wake of Federated Department 
Stores' announced interested in a merger with Macy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Ullman told unsecured creditors that offers of assistance 
recently came from St. Louis-based May Department Stores, Little Rock-based 
Dillard Department Stores and Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. Ullman did 
not accept the offers because the company wants to develop a plan on its own, 
one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 May and Dillard could not be reached for immediate comment. Dayton Hudson 
called the reports "pure speculation" and declined to comment. If Macy rejects 
a Federated offer, Federated -- one of Macy's secured creditors -- could seek 
the support of other creditors for such a merger. GEORGE WHITE

CRASH KILLS 2 AT ACCIDENT-PLAGUED SITE; NORTHRIDGE: AFTER THREE RECENT TRAFFIC 
DEATHS, NEIGHBORS CALL THE INTERSECTION HAZARDOUS.

 Two best friends were killed Thursday when a suspected drunk driver ran a red 
light and sheared their car in half, the second fatal accident since Christmas 
Day at a Northridge intersection that neighbors claim is too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the crash at Corbin Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard were Barbara N. 
Paull, 19, the driver, and her college friend, Stephanie Tourikian, 19, of 
Ontario, Canada. Both were students at UC Riverside, and Paull had just picked 
up Tourikian at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car that struck Paull's was Hector Ruiz, 22, of Canoga Park. 
Witnesses told police he was traveling about 80 m.p.h., more than twice the 
limit on Corbin. Ruiz, who was hospitalized with a head injury, may face 
charges of manslaughter and drunk driving, said Officer Joe Barnes. Both Ruiz 
and a passenger were in Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz has no criminal record, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He destroyed two lives," said a distraught Iris Paull of Chatsworth, one 
victim's mother, in an interview. "I want her home. I just want her home. I 
know, unfortunately, that's never going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Paull was described as a good student who loved children, succeeded in 
whatever she tried and planned to become a doctor. Paull and her friend, whose 
parents were traveling to Los Angeles from Canada late Thursday, had planned to 
drive together to Riverside to resume their studies later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 In shock and grief Thursday, Paull's father surveyed the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Barbara's stuff is packed and still sitting in the living room," said her 
father, Edward Paull. "It's a senseless waste of lives." 
</P>
<P>
 On Christmas Day, another driver ran a red light at the same spot, striking 
another car and killing Nelli Aghakhan, 57, of Canoga Park. The driver, John 
Bocskay, 31, was still hospitalized in critical condition Thursday. After 
striking Aghakhan, Bocskay then crashed into the side of a townhouse at the 
corner, narrowly missing the occupant. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the angry nearby residents who have complained of numerous other 
collisions and near-misses at the intersection was Rene Monestine, Paull's 
boyfriend, who accompanied both the women home from the airport and had been 
dropped off just minutes before the fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more street lights, stop signs, speed bumps, and more patrol at the 
intersection after 2 a.m. when the bars close," said Monestine, who declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 With three deaths in two weeks, six LAPD officers were at the intersection 
Thursday after the latest accident, issuing more than 60 speeding tickets 
within three hours to drivers who exceeded the speed limit by more than 15 
m.p.h., said Capt. Ronald Bergmann. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual for the Valley," Bergmann said. "The Valley has always had a 
speeding problem because the streets are wide and they are straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have complained that because the street light at the intersection is 
the only one for several blocks along Corbin, motorists tend to drive too fast. 
But city officials said they were at a loss as to what can we done. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not much we can do," said Ray Wellbaum, a traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we put a signal between Saticoy and Roscoe, I don't think that would 
deter speeding on the streets," Wellbaum said. "You need police enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Wellbaum said he is studying the intersection to determine what is causing the 
accidents there. If there is a problem, the city will take action, Wellbaum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing (of the two accidents) brings it into the limelight, but that's 
not necessarily indicative that there's a problem," said Sgt. Mel Cunningham of 
the Valley Traffic Division. "It appears to be coincidental." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have all the laws and all the traffic controls, but if people don't 
obey them someone will be hurt," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, police recorded 15 accidents at the intersection, one of them 
fatal. Statistics for 1992 were not immediately available, but Cunningham said 
there was one fatality that year. In 1991, there were eight accidents, 
including one fatality. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the four fatal accidents in the last three years was caused by a 
vehicle that ran a red light, Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Paulls, the fact that the collision occurred at an intersection 
notorious for its hazards only deepened the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my life I told her that I loved her," said the father. "She knew she was 
loved. And I will continue to tell her that."

HOPE AMID ASHES; NEW FRIENDS AID COUPLE WHO LOST SON IN HOLIDAY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A newly arrived Michigan couple, whose 3-year-old son was fatally injured last 
week in a fire that started in a Christmas tree, said the tragedy has 
strengthened their ties to a community that poured forth aid and friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's been so supportive and so helpful," said Clint Johnson, 30. "So 
many people we don't know. It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 In a tearful bedside interview at Holy Cross Medical Center on Wednesday 
night, parents Clint and Shawn Johnson said they have decided to donate their 
son's vital organs to save the lives of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shawn and Clint both prayed for a miracle," said her father, Earl Shangle, 
who flew here with his wife from Grand Rapids, Mich., after the Dec. 30 fire. 
"They didn't get their miracle. But they wanted something of Lance to go to 
another child that needed a miracle." Sitting up in bed with her bandaged 
forearms raised over her bed, Shawn Johnson, 27, said, "I suggested it. . . . 
It's a way to let him live on in others." 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Johnson was badly burned when she tried to save Lance, who had sought 
refuge in a closet after the family's Sylmar house burst into flames. She was 
able to get Lance's older brother, Denton, 4, out of the house, but could not 
find Lance. Firefighters pulled him from the closet, unconscious and not 
breathing. They revived the boy, but he died of complications of smoke 
inhalation four days later at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of three deaths this holiday season attributed to Christmas tree 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of her release Thursday, Shawn Johnson recounted fractured memories 
of her harrowing attempt to save Lance, after Denton apparently ignited the 
tree with a butane fireplace lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Johnsons had moved to the rented house on Gridley Street on Dec. 22, after 
Clint was transferred to Los Angeles by his firm, the Knoll Group, which 
manufactures furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Clint Johnson already had gone to work that morning when the fire began in 
their 8-foot Christmas tree and, in seconds, engulfed the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up and went to the bathroom," Shawn Johnson said, recalling the moments 
before the fire. "My oldest son ran in and said, 'There's a fire! Fire, Mommy!' 
" She said they ran to the dining room and she grabbed the phone to call 911. 
</P>
<P>
 The line went dead as she talked to the operator, she believes because the 
line was burned as the fire spread. She ran out the sliding glass door with 
Denton, then returned to the burning house to look for Lance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't find my other son," she said. "It was fire over the ceiling, over 
the floor. I tried to get down on my knees, but I couldn't get in." 
</P>
<P>
 She suffered first- and second-degree burns on her hands, shoulders and back, 
but doesn't remember exactly how. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was burned," she said. "I just didn't think it was bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The Johnsons are now focusing on helping Denton get through the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want us to ask him questions," Clint Johnson said. "They want us 
to answer his questions, to help him understand because he didn't understand it 
all, to try to answer his questions as he figures it out himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Clint Johnson said he took Denton to see his brother in the hospital before 
Lance died Monday "because I didn't want him not to know where his brother 
went." 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked, 'Daddy, why are you crying?' I said, 'Because I'm sad for Lance.' I 
just explained to him that he was hurt really bad. He looked around the room to 
see what everybody else's reaction was. Our hardest time right now is to get 
him through this." 
</P>
<P>
 Having lived in Los Angeles only eight days at the time of the fire, the 
family had no friends here. Since the tragedy, however, they have been enfolded 
in goodwill, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our neighbor, Dana -- I don't even know her last name -- has been a big 
help," Clint Johnson said. "She brought me clothes and food. One other 
neighbor, Pat, kept our dog. She will keep him as long as needed." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's quite the ornery dog," Shawn Johnson added. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to individual offers of help, the Johnsons' neighbors have set up 
a fund for them with the assistance of St. Didacus Catholic Church. Checks can 
be made out to Clint Johnson or the St. Didacus Christian Service, and mailed 
to the church at 14339 Astoria St., Sylmar 91342, said Father Peter Amy. 
</P>
<P>
 The warmth shown by the community has even won over Shawn Johnson's parents, 
who were skeptical about the couple's move West. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife was against them coming out here because they didn't know anybody," 
Earl Shangle said. "All we ever heard was bad things about Los Angeles. We were 
concerned if something happened, there wouldn't be anybody for them. Now we 
feel this is the place for them because they have so many friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Johnson hopes she has one thing to offer in return: the wisdom of 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one thing I'd like to stress," she said. "You should sit down with 
your children and have a fire route and talk about it once a month so they 
don't go hide in a closet." And the Johnsons said they'll never again celebrate 
Christmas with an indoor tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll never take that risk again," Clint Johnson said. "That's too 
dangerous." Shawn Johnson added: "I think we'll plant one outside and decorate 
it in memory of Lance."

CHRISTMAS IN JANUARY FOR ARMENIANS; RELIGION: KAREKIN II, BASED IN BEIRUT, 
OFFICIATES AT CEREMONY AT A CONGREGATION IN ENCINO. CHURCH IS ONE OF A HANDFUL 
THAT HOLDS THE OBSERVANCE EARLY IN THE NEW YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 Armenian pontiff Catholicos Karekin II celebrated Christmas rites Thursday 
before 2,500 worshipers, including a woman who last saw him in 1983 in Cyprus 
and a 22-year-old convert who was impressed with the ceremonial pomp. 
</P>
<P>
 Karekin II, based in Beirut, is one of two spiritual leaders in the world for 
Armenian Christians who follow the ancient rites. He began a 19-day California 
visit this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Halladjian traveled from Glendale to the Holy Martyrs Armenian Apostolic 
Church in Encino so that she could see Karekin II arrive for the 11 a.m. 
Pontifical Divine Liturgy. The Armenian Apostolic Church is one of a handful of 
Eastern church bodies that have kept an early January date for Christmas, in 
contrast to the December observance in most of Christendom. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never misses a Sunday or any other service," Kevork Halladjian said of 
his mother, who emigrated from Greece in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging later in gold-embroidered vestments and miter (and the inevitable 
portable microphone almost invisible in the folds of his garb), the 61-year-old 
Karekin II stepped under a red canopy and onto a red carpet as incense wafted 
along his route to the large church hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching all this while holding a 2-month-old baby wrapped in a blanket was 
red-haired Angelique Meshefedjian, 22, of Van Nuys, who has been married to a 
man of Armenian heritage for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was married and baptized in this church, but this is the first time I've 
come for a service," she said, adding that her background is nondenominational 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the atmosphere," she said. "They put on a nice performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Karekin II, an Oxford-educated prelate who is articulate in English but speaks 
mostly in Armenian at services, will officiate at Armenian Memorial Day 
ceremonies today at Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn Memorial Park and at the 
Armenian Martyrs Monument in Montebello's Bicknell Park. 
</P>
<P>
 He will return Saturday night to Holy Martyrs church to speak at a 
fund-raising banquet for the church's high school. The congregation also has a 
school campus in Northridge for lower grades. 
</P>
<P>
 In an animated sermon during Thursday's three-hour rites, the pontiff exhorted 
church members to make personal sacrifices to support Armenian schools. He 
referred briefly in English to Gov. Pete Wilson's State of the State Address on 
Wednesday in which the governor said new jobs and safe streets were going to be 
twin pillars of his administration this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we get safe streets and new jobs without genuine education?" Karekin 
II asked. 
</P>
<P>
 As thousands crowded the church's main hall and the 250-seat church where the 
services were relayed by close-circuit television, hundreds of other Armenian 
Americans were attending St. Peter Armenian Church not far away in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Peter is aligned with the branch of the ancient church based in 
Etchmaidzin, the Republic of Armenia, currently headed by Vazken I. The break 
occurred in 1933 in disputes over whether the Armenian-based church was free of 
Soviet influence. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the breakup of the Soviet Union and especially after the disastrous 
1988 earthquake in Armenia, leaders of the two church bodies have worked toward 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have unity, the only questions left are administrative," Karekin II said 
to reporters Thursday. "In due course, it will happen if we get stronger 
cooperation in the ranks of ordinary people." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 300,000 Armenians in Southern California are associated with one 
wing of the historic church or the other. Nevertheless, many Armenian Americans 
have gravitated to other churches, such as former Gov. George Deukmejian, an 
Episcopalian, and the 1,000 active members of the United Armenian 
Congregational Church in Cahuenga Pass. That congregation held Christmas 
services on both Dec. 25 and Thursday night in keeping with their bicultural 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jan. 6 falls on a weekday, Armenian churches have found that morning 
rites have not been well-attended -- except in recent years as the tide of 
immigrants has grown, priests said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Martyrs church especially has a high proportion of new arrivals in its 
congregation, according to the priests. But the occasion of His Holiness 
Karekin II officiating at the Christmas rites drew a much larger crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, when Jan. 6 was on a Monday, we had only 25% of this crowd," 
estimated Harout Shakelian, a car broker. "This is extraordinary."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PLANNERS TO UNVEIL VISIONS OF THE FUTURE

<P>
 Roughly halfway through redrawing a blueprint for future growth in Los 
Angeles, urban planners later this month will unveil preliminary designs on how 
the city could look, move and feel 20 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of 15 community meetings -- four of them in the San Fernando 
Valley -- Los Angeles planners working to update the city's General Plan will 
display their ideas and seek suggestions from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Plan is the document on which all other land-use policies are 
based. Some refer to it as a local government's land-use "constitution" because 
it dictates in general terms how a city should develop. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being a long-term vision for growth and development, the 
General Plan is intended to guide public transit improvements and attempts to 
address issues such as affordable housing and traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Los Angeles, the General Plan has not been updated since 1974. 
Planners have been working to redraw the Los Angeles plan since last year, when 
they asked for community ideas on how the city should develop. 
</P>
<P>
 Those ideas were the basis of the designs to be displayed later this month. 
Planners will incorporate new public suggestions into any modifications to the 
plan before they take a final version to city officials later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Local meetings are scheduled for: 
</P>
<P>
 * The northwest Valley at 6:30 p.m. Jan. 25 in the third-floor conference room 
at Kaiser Panorama City, 13652 Cantara St. 
</P>
<P>
 * The northeast Valley at 9 a.m. Jan. 29 at the Sunland-Tujunga Municipal 
Center Auditorium, 7747 Foothill Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 * The southwest Valley at 6:30 p.m. Feb. 8 in the auditorium at Kaiser 
Woodland Hills, 5601 De Soto Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 * The southeast Valley at 6:30 p.m. Feb. 16 in the main auditorium of the Van 
Nuys/Sherman Oaks Senior Center, 5056 Van Nuys Blvd. AARON CURTISS

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; EX-POLICE OFFICER TO CHALLENGE KATZ 
</P>

<P>
 A Sylmar resident who is a political unknown has said he will run for the 39th 
Assembly District seat held by Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
 Ollie M. McCaulley, a Democrat and former South Gate police officer active in 
youth sports and counseling, announced his candidacy Thursday on a platform 
focusing on illegal immigration and criminal justice reform. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Marine who owns an accounts management firm, McCaulley said he has 
been weighing a run for office for nearly a decade while accruing more 
community experience. He has been a high school assistant coach and is a youth 
counselor and football coach for the Northridge Athletic Club, where he also is 
a board member. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaulley, 37, said he is campaigning under the assumption that Katz will 
decide to run again, despite speculation that the assemblyman is eyeing a 
different office. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaulley said he will hone in on illegal immigration, pushing for tighter 
border controls, but also programs to make undocumented residents more 
productive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to deal with the fact that they are here," he said. "We can't just 
leave them to stand on a corner and be picked up for cheap labor." 
</P>
<P>
 McCaulley also said the state does not need more gun control, but better 
control of the violent felons it convicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a lot of gun-control laws," he said. "My question is what are 
we going to do with the people who use the guns and go to prison, then get out? 
I think we need stricter laws." 
</P>
<P>
 He favors "three-strikes" proposals that would sentence violent felons to 
lengthy terms on their third felony convictions, but said first convictions 
should be stricter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why does there have to be three victims to see the light?" he said. "If we 
say you're doing 10 years, you should serve 10 years." GEOFFREY MOHAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: WOMAN KEEPS IN TUNE WITH ANCIENT MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONDRA FARRELL BAZROD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elisabeth Waldo is trying to bring the mostly forgotten sounds of ancient 
music to life in the present.  
</P>
<P>
 Her Northridge home houses a collection of instruments -- some 2,000 years old 
-- made of clay, seashells, reed, animal bones, copper, bronze, gold, wood, 
stone, gourds, deer hoofs and cocoons. Most are percussion and wind instruments 
and generally are in the shape of animals, birds, humans (as gods) and plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to speculate what the music would have been like, and based on my own 
intuition and archeological finds," she said. "I composed the music blending 
those ancient sounds with the modern." 
</P>
<P>
 Waldo became fascinated with ethnic music when she was growing up on a ranch 
at the edge of the Yakima Indian Reservation in Washington state. Although she 
learned to play the violin, the magical Native American sounds of her childhood 
stayed with her. 
</P>
<P>
 She studied classical music with Russian violinist Efrem Zimbalist at the 
Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, then toured with the All American Youth 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 But while working with the Los Angeles Philharmonic early in her career, she 
realized that the mystical sounds of indigenous peoples had to be part of her 
musical life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't sit and play only Bach," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While performing in Mexico, she met artist Diego Rivera, who became a friend 
and mentor. "He encouraged me to research the ancient and great Indian 
civilizations and their pre -- Colombian instruments," she said. "In a sense I 
was breaking away from classical training and testing new ground." 
</P>
<P>
 She began to play instruments that Native Americans had developed based on the 
guitars and violins brought by the Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Indians called them 'the woods that sing,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldo's late husband, Carl Dentzel, was director of the Southwest Museum on 
Mt. Washington for 25 years and a longtime San Fernando Valley resident. He 
helped to give Northridge its name, and their home, Rancho Cordillera del 
Norte, is named for the community as well. The name is Spanish for Ranch of the 
North Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with sons Dana Carl and Paul Dentzel, Waldo's Multi-Cultural Music and 
Art Foundation of Northridge -- located on the family's property -- has 
expanded to include performing and visual arts of many other cultures of the 
world. Activities at the rancho include live concerts, workshops and both local 
and international tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldo said she is particularly enchanted by the music of early California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always blended the instruments of indigenous America into my musical 
scores . . . rescuing their sounds from the silence of the tombs," she said. "I 
fuse the past with the present, to create music of the spirit for today."

 Executives from MCA Inc. are scheduled to meet with the state's top 
economic-affairs official today to discuss the entertainment giant's bid to 
relocate a planned Metro Rail station from Lankershim Boulevard to a site 
nearer its Universal Studios and CityWalk attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA spokeswoman Christine Hanson would not discuss details of the meeting with 
Julie Meier Wright, secretary of the Trade and Commerce Agency, saying only, 
"We contacted state officials and we'll be talking about the location of the 
station." 
</P>
<P>
 MCA has threatened to withhold an estimated $8 million it is expected to 
provide to help pay for the Lankershim Station if the station is not moved to a 
site under the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who reports to Gov. Pete Wilson, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 She is credited with creating the so-called Red Team approach in which 
government and private-sector officials come together to solve problems and has 
experience in settling such disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Red Team helped Fox Inc. get approvals for the $200-million 
expansion of its studio lot in Century City. It was also assembled for talks 
regarding Westcot, the proposed second gate at Disneyland in Anaheim. SCOTT

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; OFFICIAL TEMPORARILY FILLS MARGARITO'S POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 City officials moved quickly this week to fill gaps and repair damage done 
after the firing of controversial but well-liked parks chief Jess Margarito. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito, a former councilman and mayor of San Fernando, was fired from his 
post Monday amid allegations that he falsified city records and misappropriated 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer Jerry Wedding has taken over the helm of the Recreation and 
Community Services Department, said City Administrator Mary Strenn. The City 
Council will decide on a permanent replacement, but the topic has not yet been 
placed on its Jan. 17 agenda, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not plan on this being a long-term thing," she said of Wedding's 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedding formerly headed the Public Works Department in the city of Fillmore 
and worked on an improvement plan for San Fernando's Las Palmas Park, Strenn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strenn said she has been meeting with employees to ensure there are no 
problems. "I'm confident that their first concern is providing good service," 
she said. "They did it well before, and I think they'll do it well in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Some employees expressed shock and surprise at Margarito's firing Tuesday, and 
some were in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, Wedding said, there has been no evidence of factions or animosity 
among the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, parks caretaker Pedro Dominguez remains on administrative leave, 
said Strenn, who would not elaborate. Investigators alleged that both Margarito 
and Dominguez signed falsified time cards for convicts assigned to work off 
sentences in parks, according to a search warrant affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez said earlier this week that he was placed on leave after refusing to 
speak to investigators without a lawyer present. 
</P>
<P>
 JoAnn Carey, Margarito's secretary, remains on duty, said Strenn. The warrant 
affidavit sought her records along with Margarito's and alleged that she 
prepared a false complaint against another employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Wading into the midst of the quagmire Monday was Christine Manriquez Lissik, 
the city's newly appointed personnel director. A former personnel management 
specialist for Cal State Fullerton, Lissik so far has kept a low profile during 
the transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have had no involvement at all," Lissik said. "My goals are to 
continue with the fine standards of my predecessor, Bill Hamilton." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, an interim director and private consultant, ends his contract with 
the city this month. GEOFFREY MOHAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; PLANS REVEALED FOR SITE OF 'LAKE HAYVENHURST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction is slated to begin in April on a 93,000-square-foot shopping 
center at the intersection of Hayvenhurst Avenue and Ventura Boulevard in 
Encino, a developer announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino Market Center will include a Ralph's supermarket, Barnes & Noble 
bookstore, Starbuck's coffeehouse, Blockbuster music store and possibly a 
Blockbuster video store, said developer Rick Caruso of Caruso Affiliated 
Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do this very high-end, using lots of stone and architectural 
detail," Caruso said of the planned center. "This is just a great 
accomplishment on the part of everybody involved." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the center is already 94% leased and is scheduled to be completed by 
early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which will be the first to occupy the site since it was excavated 
to remove contaminated soil left behind by leaking underground gas tanks, 
sailed through the often-cumbersome city approval process, largely because it 
was supported by its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only were neighbors anxious to see the crater known as "Lake Hayvenhurst" 
filled, but they feared losing Caruso's comparatively moderate project to 
larger ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a model project for developers to look at," said homeowner 
activist Gerald Silver, who successfully fought other projects proposed for the 
site. "This is a guy who came to the community, listened to what we had to say, 
and had his project approved in literally record time." 
</P>
<P>
 As a condition of approval, Caruso was required by the city Planning 
Commission to provide 24-hour security at the center and to make street 
improvements to accommodate increased traffic created by shopping center 
patrons. SCOTT GLOVER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN POLICE CHIEF TO TAKE JOB AT GETTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stanley Friedman, the chief of police at Cal State Northridge for the past 
decade, said Thursday he is retiring to become director of museum security for 
the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu and the $733-million J. Paul Getty Center 
project being built in the Brentwood hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, 51, a former UCLA police lieutenant commander who took over the CSUN 
job in May, 1984, said his last day will be Jan. 21 and he will start at the 
Getty Museum in Malibu on Jan. 24. "It's a golden opportunity for me. I'm 
really excited about getting into a whirlwind of activity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, CSUN's campus police department has been beset by declining 
funding and staffing. The CSUN police operation has an annual budget of about 
$900,000 and has about 15 officers, several less than its authorized strength. 
Friedman is expected to get a raise from the $76,000-a-year salary he said he 
was earning at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Friedman said he had not been looking for jobs elsewhere until 
getting a notice of the Getty job some months ago. "When that flyer came in, I 
had no intention of leaving," he said. But the Northridge chief said he felt 
the Getty job "couldn't have fit me better." He notified his officers and 
superiors at CSUN of his departure on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In moving to the Getty Museum, Friedman will maintain his association with his 
present boss, university President Blenda J. Wilson. Last year, Wilson was 
elected to the board of trustees of the Getty Trust, the private foundation 
worth more than $4 billion that administers eight programs including the Malibu 
museum and Getty Center project. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said Getty officials contacted Wilson about his job prospect only 
after he became a finalist. CSUN officials had no immediate word about a 
replacement for Friedman at CSUN, where he also serves as director of public 
safety. Friedman said of his CSUN tenure, "I've made a lot of friends. It's 
going to be full of emotion when the days start getting closer to the end."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; $25,000 OFFERED FOR LEADS IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council this week authorized a $25,000 reward for 
information leading to the identification and apprehension of the suspects 
responsible for killing Lea Graf, co-owner of a Army-Navy surplus store in 
Reseda, last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, 61, was killed when she and her husband were overtaken by two gunmen as 
they were closing their Reseda Boulevard store for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have made no arrests and still have no suspects. They asked 
Councilwoman Laura Chick to petition the council for reward money last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that the reward announcement will generate some leads," said Los 
Angeles Police Lt. George Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, married 34 years, moved to Los Angeles from Israel in 1960. After 
dabbling in other business ventures, they set up the surplus store that became 
an institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Graf, Lea's husband, was injured in the attack, but managed to shoot 
back at the gunmen seven times before they fled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how effective it (a reward) has been in the past, but I hope 
we'll have some response from somebody," Graf said. "We're hoping maybe this 
time something will come up." TERESA ANN WILLIS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; RACIST FLYERS STUFFED INTO SCHOOL LOCKERS 
</P>

<P>
 Dozens of Agoura High School students found racist hate flyers stuffed into 
their lockers this week, school administrators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The vitriolic hate messages on the more than 75 flyers found at the school are 
similar or identical to those found in a rash of like incidents in San 
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley stores in the past several weeks, 
police said. The messages have been stamped on notebooks and library books as 
well as tucked into soda 12-packs, popcorn packages and pantyhose containers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the same flyers going all over the Valley," said Sgt. Dean Winters 
of the Lost Hills sheriff's station. "We are concerned about it, but the 
problem is, it's not really a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Winters said there will be no formal investigation of the incident because the 
flyer activity at the school, by itself, is not illegal. He added that officers 
plan to assist the Las Virgenes School District in determining whether the act 
violated an education code. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal of Agoura High School, James Christianson, said administrators, 
teachers and students were sickened by the flyers, which contain hateful 
messages saying that Los Angeles and the nation are being overrun by 
immigrants. He said he immediately spoke to students over the public address 
system to condemn the act. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all very incensed," Christianson said. "This is very hateful 
material. Nobody likes this type of thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Christianson said a student reported seeing a man stuffing the lockers at 
about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday. The student was on campus to retrieve a book from his 
locker. 
</P>
<P>
 The Las Virgenes School District has offered a $500 reward for information 
leading to the identification and apprehension of the individual involved, 
according to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do anything we can within the constraints of the law to bring an end 
to this type of behavior," said Albert Marley, the district superintendent.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is something that hurts all of us as a society." SUSAN BYRNES

 A fund-raising effort is under way to help the family of a 6-year-old boy, who 
survived a rare blood disease, pay mounting medical and rehabilitation bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping we can fill the house and help this family," said Bonnie Popp, a 
spokeswoman for the Parent-Teacher Organization of the American Lutheran 
Elementary School in Burbank, which has organized a benefit concert to be held 
Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Bridge, a kindergarten student at the school of about 100 pupils, 
received a bone-marrow transplant from his 7-month-old sister last year as 
treatment for Diamond-Blackfan syndrome, a rare blood disease that prevented 
his own bone marrow from producing new blood cells. The transplant cured the 
disease, but the boy later suffered two strokes and was hospitalized at UCLA 
Medical Center and Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The strokes will require years of rehabilitative therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 The parent-teacher group has put together a benefit concert featuring Craig 'N 
Co., a rock band geared toward children and led by Craig Taubman, a Disney Co. 
recording artist popular with children. The concert will be held at the 
Burroughs High School auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has certainly shown us how much we need one another," said Daniel's 
mother, Melissa Bridge. Daniel is one of five Bridge children. "We are amazed 
at the love shown to us by the people." ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; DISTRICTWIDE HEALTH ACADEMY STUDIED

<P>
 The Glendale Board of Education is scheduled to vote today on Crescenta Valley 
High School's plan to set up a program for students interested in the health 
and medicine field. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed four-year health academy at the La Crescenta campus would start at 
the ninth-grade level in September and would be open to students districtwide, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to regular required subjects such as mathematics and English, 
students each year would take science courses specific to the health and 
medicine professions, such as biology and chemistry, said Chakib Sambar, 
Crescenta Valley High's vice principal of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 They would also serve as interns during the school day at Verdugo Hills 
Hospital, assisting hospital staff, Sambar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We envision students spending two days a week in the afternoons or six hours 
(a week) at the hospital," he said. "We have a great idea. . . . We feel 
confident that the board is going to give us a positive response to go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members discussed the health academy plan during their regular meeting 
Tuesday but decided to hold a special meeting today to give staff more time to 
present a more detailed report, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A vote in favor of the plan would allow Crescenta Valley High to apply for a 
$20,000 to $35,000 planning grant from the state Education Department -- also 
due today, Sambar said. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the state, the grant could be issued as early as March. School 
staff would then be able to work out the fine points of the program, such as 
class schedules and personnel costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy would be considered a magnet school because it would be open to 
high school students throughout the district. Currently, the only similar 
program is at Glendale High School and involves students interested in a career 
in cosmetology, said Donald W. Empey, deputy superintendent of educational 
services. TOMMY LI

2 PLEAD GUILTY IN ATTACK ON 7-ELEVEN CLERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two Chatsworth men pleaded guilty Thursday to attempted murder in an attack on 
a West Hills convenience store clerk who was stabbed nearly two dozen times 
during a $25 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a deal with prosecutors that spares them from potential life 
sentences, Frank Eric Kaatz and Scott Howard Goodman each will be sentenced to 
14 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Amolak Singh Saini, a 26-year-old Indian immigrant who had worked at the 
Saticoy Street store less than one month, was attacked March 24 when four 
drunken men entered the 7-Eleven store and stole beer, cigarettes and two cash 
registers. 
</P>
<P>
 Saini said he was stabbed by Kaatz, who is seen on a security videotape 
jumping the sales counter, and then by Goodman in the parking lot as he tried 
to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven J. Ipsen said Kaatz and Goodman were assigned to 
take out Saini, while two accomplices took merchandise and a fifth man acted as 
getaway driver. 
</P>
<P>
 The men who toted out the merchandise -- Carlos Ramon Garcia, a 21-year-old 
Simi Valley man, and David Michael Dalhanty, a 19-year-old from Chatsworth -- 
previously pleaded guilty to robbery and received four-year prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth man, 20-year-old Jason Garcia -- the younger brother of Carlos -- 
turned state's evidence and was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange 
for his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaatz, 20, and Goodman, 23, made their guilty pleas on the final day of a 
lengthy and often-delayed preliminary hearing that began in September. During 
seven days in court, the pair heard Jason Garcia testify about their roles in 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Garcia testified that each member of the party received about $5 after 
they smashed open one of the cash registers, according to Ipsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Judge Michael S. Luros is scheduled to sentence Kaatz and 
Goodman on Jan. 27.

COUNCILMAN TO DONATE $11,000 TO POLICE; POLITICS: HAL BERNSON IS WORKING TO 
ESTABLISH A FUND FOR OFFICERS AFTER BEING ORDERED TO REPAY A LAUNDERED CAMPAIGN 
CONTRIBUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson responded to an order by the city's 
Ethics Commission to repay $11,000 in laundered campaign contributions, saying 
Thursday he will donate the money to police in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson instructed city officials Wednesday to establish a fund for police in 
the Devonshire Division, and said he also will give police $5,000 from a 5% 
salary increase that he and other local elected officials are scheduled to 
receive this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The $11,000 in contributions came from Evergreen American Corp., a giant 
shipping firm that admitted last year to illegally funneling $172,000 in 
contributions to state and local officials through employees, relatives and 
friends. Campaign laws require that the sources of all contributions be 
disclosed so that the public can determine where the money originated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's donation appears to have satisfied the Ethics Commission's request 
for repayment of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi Strauss, chief of enforcement for the commission, said she only received 
a copy of Bernson's letter explaining his donation idea on Thursday but 
believes it will satisfy the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our preliminary view is that (the donation) complies with the Ethics 
Commission's request," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other city and state officials who also received illegal contributions 
from Evergreen have repaid the money. Only Bernson and former Mayor Tom Bradley 
rejected the Ethics Commission's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson has argued that he should be allowed to keep the money because he 
received it not knowing that it had been improperly donated. And he has 
rejected the commission's authority to order him to repay the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it amounts to is punishing someone for something they are innocent of," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an effort to "show good faith to the people," Bernson said he will 
raise $11,000 and donate it to police in his district to be used however police 
decide. He said he sent a letter to the commission explaining his idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just prioritizing that money," he said. "We think that there is a 
greater need in police."

RAPIST SENTENCED IN GIRLFRIEND'S SLAYING; CRIME: JAMES THOMAS HERNANDEZ 
PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED LIFE PRISON TERMS FOR ASSAULTING, TORTURING A WOMAN. 
</P>

<P>
 A handyman who confessed to killing his live-in girlfriend and burying her 
body in a North Hollywood warehouse pleaded guilty Thursday to manslaughter and 
was sentenced to 11 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But authorities said James Thomas Hernandez will never be released because he 
previously received two life sentences for raping and torturing another woman 
in the same Sherman Way warehouse about six months after disposing of the body 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe you're a very dangerous person and someone who should never be 
released from prison," said Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael J. Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of 
parole, Hernandez told authorities that he strangled Pamela Henslee, 33, on 
Oct. 4, 1992, in the apartment the couple shared on Magnolia Avenue in Van 
Nuys, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter S. Berman . 
</P>
<P>
 Henslee's body was unearthed last month. Police found the remains after 
digging through a concrete floor, about three feet of dirt, and then another 
piece of concrete. The body was hogtied with red nylon rope, the mouth covered 
with duct tape.  
</P>
<P>
 In his confession, Hernandez said he killed his girlfriend in a rage after he 
discovered she had purchased cocaine on credit. He said he also blamed the 
woman for getting him addicted to the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said he then brought her body to the vacant building, where he used 
a jackhammer to break through a cement floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Hernandez was convicted of torturing and sexually assaulting a 
25-year-old acquaintance March 27. During his trial, Hernandez blamed cocaine 
for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez worked for a firm that managed dozens of commercial properties. He 
had keys for a number of warehouses and access to heavy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The torture victim, who was left with permanent neurological damage after 
Hernandez attached an electrical device to her breasts, looked on Thursday as 
her assailant admitted publicly for the first time his role in Henslee's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think he would have been a serial killer," the woman said after 
Hernandez was led away to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he got a taste for what he had done (and if I were not able to 
escape) I think he would have continued on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rape victim testified during his trial that Hernandez repeatedly mentioned 
the name Pamela as he threatened to kill her and bury her under the floor of 
the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 During her ordeal, the woman heard noises that sounded like a shovel striking 
cement, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Farrell noted Hernandez's admitted addiction to drugs and 
pornography and urged Hernandez to work with prison officials on the problem, 
which the judge said was prevalent in society. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case has always been the number one argument against the use of cocaine, 
against the legalization of cocaine," said defense attorney Craig Robinson of 
Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is ridiculous," he said. "This is a 31-year-old man with no prior 
record, no history of any abusive behavior, and all of sudden, he's in jail for 
the rest of his life."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: PATSAOURAS CONSIDERING A RUN WHERE ROBERTI FEARED TO TREAD 
</P>

 WILD CARD?: The odds are long and the windmill is spinning, perhaps faster 
than usual. But Tarzana businessman Nick Patsaouras believes that dialogue 
strengthens and invigorates the body politic. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the 50-year-old Greek immigrant, who ran for the Los Angeles mayor's job 
last spring (placing eighth) and won kudos for the intelligence of his 
platform, is eyeing the seat being vacated by Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed 
Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky is the lone political colossus on the 
scene. In fact, Yaroslavsky's daunting presence prompted state Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Van Nuys) to withdraw from the race before even firing a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's appealing, there's no question about it," Patsaouras said this week, 
referring to the Edelman opportunity. "I know the issues at the county, but no 
one should kid themself -- Zev is a tough campaigner."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Patsaouras, who is Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich's 
appointee to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said he will not let 
conventional political considerations completely guide his plans. "I don't want 
to get tangled up in too many technicalities," Patsaouras said. "The big 
question is, 'Do you feel good about doing this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Besides that, the head of an electrical contracting company believes in the 
debate of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "God help us," Patsaouras said, "if only one person runs and they are anointed 
and crowned without a debate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SPEAKING OF DAVID AND ZEV: Every relationship has its ups and downs -- 
especially in the rough-and-tumble venue of politics. And the bond between 
Roberti and fellow Democrat Yaroslavsky is on the mend again. 
</P>
<P>
 The two powerhouse politicos will meet for lunch today, breaking bread 
together for the first time since Roberti shied away from challenging 
Yaroslavsky in the race for Los Angeles County supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti spokesman Steve Glazer says there's nothing unusual about that. 
"They've always had a cooperative and professional relationship," Glazer said, 
noting that Roberti "expressed appreciation" for Yaroslavsky's hard work on the 
City Council when he decided not to run. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, the state Senate leader may need all the friends he can get as he 
faces a recall effort spearheaded by gun-control opponents. Though they are 
dismissed by many as a fringe group swimming against the tide of public 
opinion, Glazer notes that the firearms activists pose a serious, costly threat 
to the man from Van Nuys.

 HAMMER TIME: Bill Spillane of Westlake Village, the ex-fighter pilot ace who 
ran third in the 1992 GOP primary for the 24th Congressional District seat, has 
ended his musings and decided to endorse Newbury Park banking consultant Robert 
Hammer for the same seat in this year's primary. The seat is held by U.S. Rep. 
Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). "I think he'll be a strong addition to 
our team," Hammer said this week. Spillane spent more than $200,000 of his own 
money in his foray in the '92 race. The Republican primary winner that year, 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock, later lost to Beilenson. (McClintock is now 
considering a run for state controller.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hammer has embarked on an as-of-yet low-key effort to gain hands-on 
experience of some of the area's social problems. One week he was joining West 
Valley LAPD vice squad officers in a raid on a house of prostitution, and the 
next he was helping out at a homeless shelter in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not big-deal things," Hammer said. "But instead of reading about 
these issues in a white paper, I'm seeing them firsthand. This campaign is 
about ears and voices, hearing what the voters are having to say and then 
giving voice to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newbury Park businessman appears to be positioning himself for a contrast 
between his style and that of attorney Richard Sybert, who headed Gov. Pete 
Wilson's research and planning office. 
</P>
<P>
 One can expect Hammer to portray Sybert, who insiders say is the favorite to 
win the Republican primary, as a soul-less technocrat in an ivory tower, 
cranking out position papers that may or may not deal with the real lives of 
the little people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to run a citizen's campaign, not a politician's campaign," 
Hammer said, even as he refused to compare his campaign to Sybert's.

<P>
 One person was killed and another seriously injured Thursday in a head-on 
collision on Sierra Highway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Almy, 54, of Canyon Country, was driving northbound on Sierra Highway, 
just north of Scherzinger Lane, when his car crossed the center line about 7:45 
a.m. and collided with a southbound vehicle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Almy was freed from his vehicle by county firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, where he died from 
massive internal injuries later in the day, authorities said. Carolyn Lucas, 
33, of Lancaster, the driver of the second car, suffered injuries in the 
collision. She was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where 
she remains listed in stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LOCAL EXAMS OKD IN CHILD-ABUSE CASES;

THE AREA HAS HAD A RISING RATE OF INCIDENTS.

 Responding to a high rate of reported child abuse in the Antelope Valley, Los 
Angeles County officials Thursday announced a new program that will allow 
children to be examined for signs of sexual abuse at a local hospital, instead 
of at facilities at least 75 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also creates a system under which children will only have to be 
interviewed once or twice by law enforcement and other officials, instead of 
the eight times usually necessary to mount criminal prosecutions, said Esther 
Gillies, executive director of the nonprofit Children's Center for the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to make life much, much easier for children out here," said 
Gillies, who is coordinating the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the Antelope Valley Abuse Network Team, the program is the latest in a 
series of efforts by county officials to respond to an unusual cluster of child 
slayings and a spiraling abuse rate in the Antelope Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Antelope Valley is highly underdeveloped in terms of human services, and 
this is a nice step forward," said Pete Digre, director of the county 
Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have acknowledged taking a closer look at the problem after a 
series of articles in The Times profiled a cluster of six Antelope Valley 
child-abuse slayings in just over a year, and disclosed that the region has one 
of the county's highest rates of reported child abuse -- three victims per 
1,000 people, according to the county Children's Services Department.  
</P>
<P>
 In response, the county has assigned a full-time administrator from the 
Department of Children's Services to handle child-abuse cases and opened a 
satellite juvenile court in Lancaster for dependency cases, which typically 
involve children who have been abused or neglected.  
</P>
<P>
 The newest program, scheduled to begin next week, will cost about $100,000 
this year, $80,000 of which is funded by the state and $20,000 by county 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, Gillies said.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, children will be examined for signs of sexual abuse at High 
Desert Hospital in Lancaster. Previously, they had to travel to County-USC 
Medical Center, where the county's Center for the Vulnerable Child and its 
director, Dr. Astrid Heger, are located, Gillies said. That's because each exam 
had to be witnessed by Heger, a court-certified child-abuse expert.  
</P>
<P>
 But under the new program, Heger will watch the exams on a video monitor at 
County-USC while they are conducted in Lancaster or review them later on 
videotape, said Marty Nagel, deputy regional administrator for the Department 
of Children's Services in Lancaster.  
</P>
<P>
 The program also teams about 25 sheriff's deputies, social workers and 
prosecutors together in three- to four-member units. Instead of individually 
interviewing a child who reports sexual abuse, each team will assign one member 
to conduct a comprehensive interview.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 3 YOUTHS ARRESTED IN ATTACK ON GROUP HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three male youths were arrested Thursday on suspicion of burglary and 
vandalism of a children's group home that was rendered uninhabitable by an 
attack that did an estimated $2,800 damage to the structure, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, all from Acton, allegedly entered a group home in the 32800 
block of Crown Valley Road sometime between Dec. 26 and 28, when the residents 
were away on an outing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, the youths allegedly sprayed graffiti, mustard and shaving cream 
on walls, appliances and furniture, stole $650 in cash and personal items and 
flooded the house with water by plugging every drain and then turning on the 
faucets, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of the group home were forced to seek alternative shelter after 
their home was virtually destroyed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip, detectives at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station arrested 
the youths, authorities said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STATE CALLS ITS AUDIT OF ANTELOPE VALLEY FAIR 
FINANCES 'MISLEADING'; FUNDS: AGENCY ADMITS ERROR IN SAYING BOARD DIRECTOR 
SPURRED INVESTMENT AT BANK WHERE HE IS CHAIRMAN.

 Antelope Valley Fair officials may have been displeased with the findings of a 
recent state audit that found dozens of violations of state regulations, but 
fair Director Clyde Golding was personally offended. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair directors, according to the audit, agreed to deposit investment funds in 
the bank for which Golding serves as chairman after Golding made "promises of 
improved interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
 Golding, however, successfully challenged the audit's findings. "I have never 
made that promise. I don't have that authority." 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Thursday, Golding, who has served on the fair board more 
than two decades, along with fair board President Charla Abbott and fair 
Manager Bruce Latta, released a letter from the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture that states ". . . we find our report was misleading. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "The information presented in the audit was very inaccurate," said Golding, 
who said he never did anything to entice fair board members to invest fair 
funds at Antelope Valley Bank, where he has been chairman since its 1981 
inception. 
</P>
<P>
 State auditors took Golding's remarks out of context from the minutes of a 
meeting, according to the Dec. 9 Agriculture Department letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, released in November, made 196 specific recommendations in need of 
immediate attention at the state-run fair based on a review of a two-year 
period beginning Jan. 1, 1991. The number of recommendations is nearly four 
times that made in most reviews of state fairs, according to the agriculture 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair officials must submit a response to the audit by next Friday detailing 
how recommended changes will be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Although auditors admitted they had made a mistake about Golding's comments as 
far as interest rates, they said, if nothing else, the appearance of a conflict 
of interest remains when Antelope Valley Bank does business with the Antelope 
Valley Fair so long as Golding is a fair director and bank chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fair manager must make certain that all banking institutions in the 
Antelope Valley have an equal opportunity to bid and to provide banking 
services to the fair," according to the Agriculture Department letter.  
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley Fair, according to Latta, still has its main operating account 
at Antelope Valley Bank but last year closed its investment accounts.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NASA FACILITY WILL GAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE; 
NASA: DRYDEN FLIGHT RESEARCH FACILITY HAD BEEN ON ITS OWN, BUT HAS BEEN A PART 
OF THE AMES RESEARCH CENTER SINCE 1981.

 NASA's Dryden Flight Research Facility on Thursday finally received what it's 
been seeking for years -- independence. 
</P>
<P>
 In an address that detailed changes within the space agency, Daniel S. Goldin, 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration administrator, said Dryden would 
become a separate entity.Dryden now operates as a facility of NASA's Ames 
Research Center in Mountain View. 
</P>
<P>
 Dryden will formally gain its independence March 1, according to Goldin. 
Dryden chief Kenneth Szalai was named director of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin addressed NASA employees across the country via the agency's satellite 
television network and also made a public speech in Washington. He said the 
changes and appointments outlined Thursday "will enhance and strengthen the 
agency's programs and institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the changes follow President Clinton's "goal to make government less 
expensive and more efficient, and to reinvigorate NASA." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin also announced appointments to several posts at NASA headquarters and 
named new directors for several centers, including Johnson Space Center, where 
Carolyn Huntoon will take the reins. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin said giving Dryden its independence "reflects the commitment on the 
part of NASA to reduce layers of management and empower operating organizations 
to carry out their mission with maximum benefit to the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Dryden, where NASA flight tests its research aircraft, had previously been on 
its own, but in 1981 was made a component of Ames.

 Authorities have identified the two dead men found in the rural area of Canyon 
Country last week as Los Angeles residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lee Chambers, 36, and Warren Jenkins, 31, were discovered Dec. 29 in a 
ravine near Soledad Canyon and Capra roads by a jogger who detected a foul odor 
in the area, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Irma Becerra. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers had been shot in the head and both arms and stabbed in the upper 
body, and Jenkins had been shot and stabbed in the upper body. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men are believed to have been dead for several days before they were 
found about five miles east of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators discovered a sandwich bag containing more than an ounce of rock 
cocaine on one body, but are unsure if the killings were drug-related. The 
plastic bag was concealed in the man's underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 No shell casings were found at the scene, leading investigators to believe the 
attacks occurred elsewhere.

 "Panda bears are so huggable," notes Neiman Marcus spokeswoman Billur 
Wallerich. For that reason, the motif works wonderfully on the acrylic fur coat 
from Artwear by Halley. Indeed, a little girl clad in the fuzzy frock will look 
like a living stuffed animal. "With all our consciousness focused on the 
preservation of such endangered species, the coat is timely," she adds. 
Available in the Children's World department of the Fashion Island Newport 
Beach store, toddler sizes sell for $162 and sizes 4 to 6x are $168.

 Mini skirts and short shorts might be in vogue again, but goose bumps and 
knocking knees never are. Leg wear makers come to the rescue this season with 
thick, comfortable and affordable tights that are as cozy as your favorite 
sweater. Hue responds with a cable knit sweater style for legs of a rayon-Lycra 
blend ($20) in black, smoke and natural. Everyone from the grunge gang to the 
ski set will be grateful for the thermal knit tights of nylon, Lycra spandex 
and cotton in ebony and ivory from Calvin Klein Hosiery ($11).

 Think fashion moves faster than a Formula One car? Street-wear designers are 
outpacing '93's XL looks by streaking tailored wares with racing stripes. "It's 
part of the whole sporty trend," says designer Shelly Sjobeck. That look is 
heavy on Lycra and athletic accessories such as Adidas shoes and ball caps. For 
her namesake line, Sjobeck striped her junior collection -- including a long 
maxi dress of twill ($68) -- with the same trim used in the men's line, 
designed by brother Erik. "We didn't want to do a three stripe down the sleeve 
like everyone else, so we went down the front," she adds.

 When it comes to monograms, women apparently prefer their first names to men 
who still opt for initials, says Tony Torres, owner of Things Embroidered in 
the Orange Mall. The shop personalizes sweat shirts, towels, jackets and more. 
But it's robes that Torres sees in the greatest numbers: He estimates stitching 
close to 2,000 last month. The next wave, he says, will come with the spring 
bridal season as well as around Mother's and Father's days. ROSE APODACA

CARRY, A JUDITH LEIBER SCULPTED CLUTCH IS THE MUST-HAVE ACESSORY.

 To the women who treasure them, they're real gems -- evening bags that sparkle 
and shine like diamonds and often come with a price tag to match. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaded velvet pouches, rhinestone-covered sculpted bags in animal and abstract 
shapes, satin-covered clutches with clasps adorned with faux jewels -- such 
precious purses are the must-have accessories for black-tie affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 More fashion than function, these elegant bags have become like fine jewelry; 
they're the crowning touch to a glittering ball gown or beaded cocktail dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Leiber has been compared to famed Russian jeweler Faberge for her 
handbag designs. Her coveted "minaudieres" are like small sculptures encrusted 
with thousands of tiny rhinestones, and they come in all kinds of whimsical 
shapes such as cats, monkeys and hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiber bags are the choice of opera stars, presidents' wives and celebrities. 
They have been carried to inaugurations and public affairs by Mamie Eisenhower, 
Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The purses have been 
displayed at the Smithsonian and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, those lucky enough to afford the bags (they cost up to 
$6,000) can be seen at galas with their purses dangling conspicuously from 
their arms. When it comes time to sit for dinner, women typically place the 
bags prominently at the center of the table, like a piece of crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers collect them like artwork. A lot of socialites display them in 
their homes," says Billur Wallerich, spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus in Fashion 
Island Newport Beach, which carries Leiber bags. "They are the ultimate 
accessory to add to any outfit." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiber studied her craft in Budapest, where she was born. She joined the 
Hungarian Handbag Guild as an apprentice at age 18 and achieved the rank of 
master after learning each step of making a handbag, from tanning the skins to 
engineering the clasps. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in her 70s, Leiber still participates in every aspect of her handbag 
production. On a recent morning she was in her factory in New York City 
overseeing the last of her holiday shipments. A handbag designer in the United 
States for 30 years, she began producing her trademark rhinestone-studded metal 
purses in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hadn't existed before," she says. "They were something I felt ladies 
would love." 
</P>
<P>
 They did. Women began coveting and collecting the bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a few customers who have two or three hundred bags," Leiber says. 
"When you see a lady carrying a little dog bag or a little cat bag or an egg, 
it makes you happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Leiber's latest styles: a mailbox-shaped purse with a crazy-quilt 
pattern in multicolored rhinestones ($1,535), a gold monkey covered with clear 
rhinestones ($3,035), a black mask ($1,635) and a black-and-white spotted 
bulldog ($2,675), all available at Neiman Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
 She also creates soft bags with jeweled frames. One satin bag has an Art 
Deco-inspired clasp with marcasite gems ($1,000); another comes in black 
alligator skin with a bar clasp set with semi-precious stones ($3,725). 
</P>
<P>
 Leiber finds ideas for her creations everywhere. She's been inspired by museum 
exhibits, Japanese bronzes, "a knot on a hairdo or a button on a jacket," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a good sense of humor. I think everything we do should have whimsy in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 When a friend gave her a sculpture of a sleeping cat to put by the fireplace, 
it led to one of her more famous designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have made 1,000 cat bags by now. Of course, none of them are the same 
-- some have stripes, some have flowers, some are solid." 
</P>
<P>
 More Judith Leiber bags can be found at Saks Fifth Avenue in South Coast 
Plaza, Costa Mesa, including an oblong-shaped purse inspired by Tiffany stained 
glass ($2,780), an egg-shaped bag with rhinestones set in a black, gold and red 
geometric design ($3,745) and a heart-shaped bag with a rhinestone mosaic of 
the queen of hearts ($2,010). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Leiber minaudieres, women are toting soft vintage-looking 
bags to galas, according to Jessica Morrell, handbags and accessories manager 
for Saks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything has a definite vintage flair. It's part of the romantic look -- 
the long vests, the cameos, the ruffled blouses brought them in," Morrell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Small drawstring bags and framed clutches that open like a coin purse with 
jeweled top handles are strong for night and come in every price point. Saks 
has pouches of crinkled gold or silver lame or black or navy satin for $40. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the romantic styles at Neiman Marcus: envelope bags of black velvet with 
jet beads, tassels and a braided detail on the front ($85) and a gold braided 
drawstring purse ($270). 
</P>
<P>
 Pillbox purses, beaded black velvet pouches, simple satin envelopes and hard 
metal handbags range from $20 to $70 at the Icing in Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hard pieces as well as soft," says Neta Foges, district manager for 
the Icing. "And they come in all kinds of unusual shapes." 
</P>
<P>
 Styles at the Icing include a gold or silver metal hard bags in funky abstract 
shapes with rhinestone details ($50 to $72) and a crinkled pleated envelope 
style in gold or silver lame or black satin ($20).  
</P>
<P>
 One thing these varied evening bags have in common: their size. Most bags are 
so tiny, a woman can carry only the barest of necessities. In Morrell's 
opinion, that comes down to just two crucial items: 
</P>
<P>
 "Lipstick and a credit card," she says.

CULTURE CLASHES?; LOCAL AUDIENCES AT OPERA, SYMPHONY AND BALLET DRESS TO ENJOY 
THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 No doubt about it, people swooned over the opulence of the opening opera scene 
in the movie "The Age of Innocence," but not because of the singing or the 
action on stage. They went nuts for the duds in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Every woman in a grand gown with a prominent bustle, all that gorgeous cloth 
covering acres of constricting wire and whalebone. Every man in a tail coat, 
with shirts and collars starched to the consistency of sheet metal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yep, it was gorgeous, all right. And how easy it was to imagine, two hours 
after the last note of the opera died away, an enormous collective expelling of 
breath as all that sartorial superstructure was finally loosened. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward 100 years or so to near-turn-of-the-millennium Orange County. Do 
opera or symphony or ballet audiences at the Performing Arts Center still hew 
to the code of the Victorians and dress to the nines, or are mere sixes and 
sevens -- or less -- sufficient in laid-back land? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are no rules, and I'm glad about that, because sometimes 
people's perception of what's acceptable and what isn't gets in the way of 
their attending concerts," said Louis Spisto, the vice president and executive 
director of the Pacific Symphony Orchestra. "Sometimes subscribers call and ask 
what they should wear. But I see everything from dressy dresses and expensive 
suits to jeans and bomber jackets and everything in between." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that audiences are showing up at the center dressed in thong bathing suits 
and Mighty Ducks jerseys. But this is, after all, Southern California, and we 
apparently have become accustomed to thinking of our forays into the cultural 
life as another component of leisure time, and we often dress accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, I get a feeling from Orange County residents that when they go 
out they don't want to be really dressy, but they don't want to be super casual 
either," said Greg Lawson, a fashion consultant for Alex Sebastian in South 
Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. "A major item for us is a knit mock turtleneck under a 
suit or sport coat. I find that a lot of people, when they go out at night, 
will dress down a bit rather than wear a shirt and tie. They wear that all day, 
so at night they want to be comfortable -- maybe a nice Armani sport coat and a 
casual print shirt buttoned to the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is opening night, traditionally a time to haul out the glad rags. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opening nights are always dressier than other performances," said David 
DiChiera, the general director of Opera Pacific. "You'll see people in an 
opening-night audience who really love to dress in a tuxedo, and in the same 
audience you'll see a few odd-looking couples or college students in sweaters. 
And that's great, because it reflects the heterogeneous kind of character of 
our community. It says that opera is an art form for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Performing arts spokespersons are understandably reluctant to point up any 
form of dress as unacceptable for the center. If the organization is healthy 
financially, they'd likely be happy to play to an audience of nudists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is really unacceptable," said DiChiera, "but I think the kind of 
thing one sees every so often, people coming in shorts and sandals, that has a 
sense of maybe being a little extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 Spisto said he "would be surprised to see anyone in seriously torn-up jeans. 
But really, when people come dressed casually, they still dress nicely. And I 
would say most of our classical concert audiences tend to dress in business 
clothes because they may have come directly from the office or from dinner 
after work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen everything out there. But coming to concerts is, I would hope, not 
about seeing and being seen but about experiencing great music."

DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT: SANDRA HARVEY AND FAMILY KEEP AHEAD OF THE GAME WITH COSTA 
MESA BOUTIQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bell-bottom jokes may have finally fizzled along with the fad itself after two 
years of appearing in every designer's collection, but for Newport Beach 
designer Sandra Harvey, the punch line is bittersweet. Her flared-leg 
silhouette debuted five years ago -- long before any store buyer had seen bells 
by big name labels. 
</P>
<P>
 By being among the first, she received laughs instead of orders from buyers 
who thought she was kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey got a similar response when she showed her long, silk satin slip 
dresses in 1991 to a buyer at Barneys New York, a store known for taking risks 
in the face of mainstream fashion. "The buyer said that length would never, 
never sell," recalls Alexandra Stanton, Harvey's associate. 
</P>
<P>
 With such dramatic silhouettes as ankle-skimming stretch velvet tubes trimmed 
in curled ostrich feathers (about $125) or long jersey skirts shirred in the 
back a la Jean Harlowe, Harvey's signature style seems revolutionary only for 
its elegance combined with comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sandra is always ahead of everyone else. Dealing with buyers whose jobs are 
on the line and who don't want to take a risk with a new designer just became 
frustrating," adds Stanton, who is also Harvey's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey grew unsatisfied with buyer's attempts to edit her designs. On her own, 
she was developing a private clientele of women she met at nightclubs who 
begged to buy the clothes off her back. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of the hassles of being a retail supplier, Harvey, Stanton and their 
husbands decided last year to go into retail themselves. Their showrooms in New 
York and Los Angeles were closed, and the boutiques and department stores 
nationwide were shipped their last order. The four settled on a location along 
Newport Boulevard in Costa Mesa, next to hipster magnets Rock N Java and Tower 
Records, for the first Sandra Harvey Boutique. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother pressed her to look for a space larger than the 400 square feet the 
former barber shop offered, but Harvey recalls that her draw to the location 
was "spiritual." She had driven by the store often on her way home, every time 
repeating that the shop space would someday be hers. After a five-month 
interior make-over, the boutique opened in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had (the store) designed for 10 years," Harvey says. "This is my dream. 
It's what I wanted my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 The plumbing was yanked out, the ceiling stained and a wall built separating a 
back storage room from the rest of the store. A Gothic-like cathedral doorway 
was cut into the wall. Chandeliers and refurbished antiques contrast 
beautifully with the yardage of plush dressing room curtains sustained by a 
crude chain. 
</P>
<P>
 She fought with the landlord and several painters about the floor, which she 
wanted painted with a leopard pattern. Finally Harvey resigned to get on her 
hands and knees and do it herself, with the help of her family. She clocked 
their joint effort at 300 hours. Harvey describes the narrow space as 
"Cleopatra-esque" -- sensuous, intimate and very feminine. "This is a woman's 
boutique," she declares. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get so many boys and men in here who later return with their girlfriends 
and wives to get them out of their jeans and into glamour. Tough men come in 
here, but when they see their women walk out of the dressing room they turn to 
putty." 
</P>
<P>
 That effect is no doubt a response to Harvey's sartorial philosophy: "I 
consider a Sandra Harvey woman sexy, sleek, sophisticated, understated. But she 
leaves a lingering impression that's haunting, never loud and never forgotten. 
She would never wear sequins." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Stanton: "What do women want? They want to be elegant but sexy. And a man 
wants to feel proud without feeling he needs to cover her up." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey works in two primary fabrics: matte jersey and stretch velvet. Organza, 
georgette, cotton linen and a heavy silk satin also make the seasonless 
collection. Fabrics are cut on the bias, a practice that is expensive, but 
Harvey says it pays off because shapes are softer, fitting a woman's figure 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather was Russian, gorgeous and a fine dresser. He used to tell me 
that fabric is the most important part of a garment, the way it looks, feels, 
smells," Harvey says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her velour-like velvet is washable and travels well because it doesn't crush 
and it stores compactly. And Harvey adds that it's perfect for day and night. 
</P>
<P>
 The former wardrobe consultant is well aware of the need for a practical 
wardrobe. The Basics group, in black or olive stretch velvet, features 
separates such as leggings, pullovers, cat suits and bodysuits; pieces average 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed with a no-fuss sense, these comfortable separates consider such 
problems as the double-derriere syndrome caused by most bodysuits. Harvey's has 
no snaps or elastic. Items such as the wrap-around top can also serve more than 
one use: Knotted in the front or the back, it serves as a top or a light 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I design for me," Harvey says. "I have so many events to go to. I never 
think, 'Is this going to sell?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of Barbarella, a friend's nightclub in Los Angeles, last year 
inspired her to whip up a long velvet tube with black plastic breast forms that 
go over the appropriate area. The special-order gown sells for $250. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I have something to go to I design a new outfit," she says. The 
holidays proved especially prolific, with a new design a week. Fortunately for 
Harvey's fans, she and her husband, Dana, maintain an active social life 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 A sculptor, photographer, painter and all-around artist, Dana met Sandra seven 
years ago when he was a baby-sitter for her three children, now age 9 to 14. 
They married in 1990 and had a child, now 4. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion has become a family affair. There is the partnership with her parents, 
Alexandra and Thomas Stanton, who commute from La Jolla a few times a week to 
mind the store. Their involvement has allowed Sandra to concentrate more on the 
creative side of the business, while Mom and Dad wrestle with the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Zealand native and son of a seamstress, Dana, 26, designs a line of 
avant-garde wear, Angel Boy, to cater to the eclectic club rats of Los Angeles 
(select items are available at the Sandra Harvey Boutique). 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey's eldest daughter, Candice, serves as the Sandra Harvey model, gracing 
posters and other promotional material. Only 14, she can appear twentysomething 
-- just like her 34-year-old mother. Indeed, the two are often mistaken as 
sisters; and Harvey's mother looks far younger than her 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Their fountain of youth is a formula handed down for generations that 
Alexandra Stanton is bottling into a line of natural skin care products to be 
sold in the store this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Working alongside this venture is Sandra Harvey, who will debut a signature 
line of "extremely matte" lipsticks this month, as well as a namesake fragrance 
later. "You can do without the other cosmetics, but never lipstick or perfume," 
she insists. 
</P>
<P>
 Other plans for this year include a boutique along Beverly Boulevard in Los 
Angeles. Eventually, Harvey says, she would like to see a chain of boutiques 
along shopping boulevards internationally. She says she will also continue her 
advocacy of homeless children and basic health care with such organizations as 
Child Help USA.  
</P>
<P>
 Fashion-wise this year, Harvey won't be joining the punk renaissance that 
Paris and Milan are slamming spring with. That dress decorated with rows of 
gleaming silver safety pins on the cover of style bible "W" in November? Harvey 
did it in '92. Gianni Versace may have never heard of Sandra Harvey, but she 
has gotten used to this kind of "coincidence." She keeps the pinned dress 
(long, $300; short, $225) around because "the club girls love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead Harvey has returned to her favorite eras, the '20s and '30s, playing 
with pink, a shade she considers perfectly rococo and fitting with the beaded 
tassels and delicate point shoes she predicts will be a hit this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But still expect a blackout through the collection. Although she occasionally 
sees use for colors such as red, turquoise or olive, color, she says, "is an 
accessory." 
</P>
<P>
 Her silhouettes will continue their slinky feel. But the designer warns: "You 
don't have to be skinny to be slinky." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always loved '20s and '30s glamour. I love the elegance," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey, who will wear a boa like it's a scarf, is nicknamed "glamour puss" by 
her buddies. "I don't think it's being a glamour puss. I'll go to the grocery 
store dressed the same as going to a club," she quips. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always idolized older women like my grandmother, the way they dress, the 
jewelry, the powders. It was my grandma who bought my first sewing machine." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from making doll clothes (which she sometimes made of 
clothing taken without permission from her mother's closet), a teen-age Harvey 
turned to stitching outfits for herself -- and friends who pestered her. She 
took classes in pattern-making, design and illustrating for "six years on and 
off" at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm obsessed with fashion; it's the only thing that matters to me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 With the entrance into retail, the family now makes its own patterns and 
samples and keeps production to a limited number of units, usually six or fewer 
of a style in a particular fabric. Harvey says this is a way to ensure that a 
customer won't be wearing the same outfit as everyone else at a party. "They're 
supposed to be special," she says, "like couture." 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of couture is apparent in Harvey's collection -- without the 
couture prices. Items retail for $40 to $300; the higher price tags are custom 
suits and gowns. At the boutique, Harvey offers her personal attention to 
customers, including fittings, something she says she missed as a manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything here fits every woman: curvaceous, rail, short or tall. Women come 
in saying 'I don't have the figure for this stuff.' They come in insecure of 
their bodies. They leave proclaiming 'I am a woman.' That's why I'm in this 
business. I just live to see women beautiful."

BEHIND THE SCENES; RINGING IN THE NEW WITH A BIT OF THE OLD THROWN IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking back on 1993 wasn't good enough for New Year's Eve revelers at the 
Robert Mondavi Wine & Food Center in Costa Mesa. They wanted to see all the way 
back to '43, maybe even '33, and dance to those old swing-and-sway classics. 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternative to the hectic 500-person hotel parties, Mondavi limited 
attendance to 64. Chef Sarah Scott consulted a 1938 menu from the elite Pump 
Room in Chicago, then drew her recipes from the late Vincent Price's "A 
Treasury of Recipes," in which he and wife Mary literally chronicled the 
flavors of the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondavi also urged guests to dress '30s and '40s style, and some efforts were 
inventive. 
</P>
<P>
 Toren Segerstrom donned a velvet embroidered vest under his tuxedo. Mondavi 
events manager Clare Scarborough wore a Rita Hayworth-esque long, straight, 
black velvet dress with a slit up the side and long black satin gloves. Center 
director Joyce Barela combed through vintage clothing stores to find an 
authentic black velvet hat and coat. 
</P>
<P>
 At midnight, everyone was on the black and white dance floor, and when Kathy 
Segal Garcia and her band led the countdown, the couples did a very '30, '40s 
and '90s thing: With champagne glasses in hand, they kissed and cheered in the 
new year.

SPOTLIGHT ON THE AUDIENCE; FROM HIP-HOP TO SUNDAY BEST, ATTENTION TO ATTIRE IN 
THE STUDIO DOESN'T END WITH THE STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When a camera pans the studio audience of a typical TV show, it often reveals 
the dregs of fashion: the bright and unpressed apparel of tourists who have 
been nabbed by professional audience wranglers outside Mann's Chinese Theater 
or the Universal Studio tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few behind-the-scenes crowds appear to take some interest in fashion. 
And at least one image-conscious producer sees to it that his groups make a 
good impression on home viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget seeing one of Bob Hope's anniversary shows," says Vin Di 
Bona, executive producer of "America's Funniest Home Videos." "Everyone (on 
stage) was in tuxes, and the camera panned down on a guy in the first row 
wearing a tank top." He realized then, he says, what an important role an 
audience can play in setting a program's tone, be it hip or wholesome. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a studio full of well-scrubbed faces for its tapings, "America's 
Funniest Home Videos" buses in church congregations, civic groups, athletes and 
cheerleaders, providing a donation, free tickets and transportation in exchange 
for wearing Sunday-best attire. If out-of-town contenders for the best video 
prize look suspiciously well-groomed, it's because the show's staff does their 
hair and makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 As an extra incentive to get audience members to button up in jackets, ties 
and dresses, Di Bona offers a $100 cash prize each to the best-dressed man and 
woman, as chosen by the audience. The payoff for the veteran producer is a 
squeaky-clean crowd that "provides a wonderful family look for people at home," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The makers of "Home Improvement" go for a blue-collar look when plucking 
audience members for its show-within-a-show "Tool Time" segment. To improve 
their chances for a possible cameo, knowledgeable fans of the ABC sitcom dress 
as if for a nippy day in the Midwest, where the show is set. Pages at the 
Disney studios in Burbank scout the line for those in cold-weather, 
construction worker-type clothes -- ideally, a plaid flannel shirt, sweat 
shirt, hat, parka and beard. 
</P>
<P>
 Sport coats and ties are equally out of place at tapings of NBC's "The Tonight 
Show With Jay Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 "First time here?" Leno asks a few standouts in suits as he warms up a crowd 
of locals and vacationers in T-shirts adorned with sports logos and jeans. (A 
special live New Year's Eve bash for which the men were asked to wear jackets 
and ties was an exception.)

 Fans who camp out overnight to get tickets for a popular guest, such as radio 
personality Howard Stern or musicians Duran Duran, appear particularly rumpled. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The show's manager of guest relations, Bill Connor, says his only concerns 
about dress code stem from Federal Communication Commission rules that prohibit 
obscenity. So far, he hasn't had to eject anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical recent "Tonight" crowd included grunge-wearing Mesa, Ariz., 
newlyweds on their honeymoon; a Seattle tourist in cross-stratum O'Neill shorts 
and Hugo Boss T-shirt, and Glendale College baseball team members in collegiate 
logo clothes from every school, it appeared, but their own.

 Other shows seem to draw a more fashion-conscious crowd, whether they appear 
on camera. Fox's "In Living Color" and "Living Single" and the syndicated 
"Arsenio Hall Show" audiences, for example, tend to try to look cool in current 
labels, modern hairstyles and dark colors. Among recent sightings: giant pants 
with rolled cuffs, crosses on black cords, goatees, sideburns, elaborately 
curled or braided hairdos and sleek blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 A trio of young men at a recent "Living Single" taping wore hip-hop clothes 
with the Factory label that they had bought at the Oak Tree retail chain. One 
added an authentic firefighter's jacket over a T-shirt from Clark, an Atlanta 
college.  
</P>
<P>
 An even younger group populates the audience of Nickelodeon's "Roundhouse," a 
variety show taped like a live stage production. The grade- through 
high-schoolers -- many of them aspiring to groupie status -- often mimic the 
styles of the actors, such as '60s and '70s vintage clothes mixed with plaid 
flannel shirts, oversize pants and Doc Martens. Those truly in the loop wear 
the official black "Roundhouse" T-shirt from the studio store.

CULTURE WATCH; POSTAL CHANGES TRY TO FOSTER SECURE FEELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to make it a bit easier for battered women to leave their troubles 
behind, the U.S. Postal Service this week announced two planned changes in its 
mail-forwarding system. 
</P>
<P>
 One change would prevent people from simply walking into a post office and 
finding out where someone has moved. 
</P>
<P>
 The other would block new address information of people protected by court 
orders from the system's address correction services. 
</P>
<P>
 "If both these changes result in one person or one family feeling safe, then 
I'm all for it," Postmaster General Marvin Runyon says. "Clearly, there are 
troubled individuals who could use our system of address changes for malicious 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Two million to 4 million women are physically abused each year, the National 
Victim Center says. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic violence causes 100,000 days of hospitalization and 30,000 visits to 
hospital emergency rooms each year, the American Medical Assn. says. 
</P>
<P>
 Runyon says the new policies should take effect within six months.
