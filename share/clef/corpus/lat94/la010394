RAIDERS WIN SURVIVAL OF FOOTEST; PRO FOOTBALL: JAEGER'S 47-YARD KICK PUTS L.A.

 Sudden death? The Raiders faced it all day Sunday, from the first minute to 
the 67th, from the game-opening coin toss to the overtime toss. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there they were in the seventh minute of the fifth quarter of their 16th 
game in their 18th week of play, and they weren't dead yet. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:36 Sunday afternoon, almost every seat in the Coliseum remained filled. 
And the Raiders were still out there, trying to beat the Denver Broncos in 
sudden-death overtime of their regular-season finale to give themselves new 
life in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Every eye was on Jeff Jaeger, who already had kicked three field goals Sunday 
and a team record 34 this season, who already had beaten the Broncos once this 
season with a game-winning kick in the closing seconds, and was now attempting 
to do it again from 47 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so quiet in the Coliseum, you could almost hear the Broncos' hearts 
drop when Jaeger calmly connected, getting his full foot on a ball that sailed 
smoothly between the uprights and into the setting sun above the closed end of 
the Coliseum, enabling the Raiders to rise again and return to the playoffs 
after missing out last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Jaeger's kick had bounced off the protective screen, the noise 
returned, from the crowd and on the field, the sounds of ultimate elation and 
celebration as Jaeger disappeared in a sea of silver and black. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have time to think about it," a smiling Jaeger said. "If you let it 
go through your head, you shouldn't be out there." 
</P>
<P>
 With an improbable 33-30 victory before an ecstatic sellout crowd of 66,904, 
the Raiders, led by Jaeger, quarterback Jeff Hostetler (25 of 41 for 310 yards 
and three touchdowns) and receiver Tim Brown (a career-high 11 catches for 173 
yards and two touchdowns) not only won a playoff spot, but also the right to 
play host to their first game. The Raiders will again face the Broncos next 
Sunday afternoon at the Coliseum in a first-round, wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
 Nail-biting finish? In the locker room afterward, many of the Raiders exuded 
confidence. They had appeared dead so many times this season and so many times 
on Sunday alone, they seemed to believe nothing would stop them from beating 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders already had survived despite a victory by the Pittsburgh Steelers 
earlier in the day, a result that was announced soon after the opening kickoff. 
A Steeler loss would have automatically given the Raiders a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had survived injuries earlier in the game to receiver/kick 
returner Rocket Ismail (strained neck), running back Randy Jordan (concussion) 
and defensive lineman Nolan Harrison (leg). Only Harrison returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had survived despite falling behind the Broncos, 27-13, at the 
half and 30-13 in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had survived despite coming down to the final play of regulation 
needing a touchdown to tie. They got it on a four-yard scoring pass from 
Hostetler to Alexander Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had survived despite losing the coin toss for the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had survived despite an opportunity for a game-winning field goal 
by Jason Elam in overtime. Elam's 40-yard kick was wide left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say enough about how proud I am of these guys," Coach Art Shell said, 
when it was finally over. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was our day," Hostetler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not at the beginning it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail was injured on the opening kickoff, Harrison on the first play from 
scrimmage, and Jordan in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Steelers already had won. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeling from the bad news, the Raiders appeared headed for the knockout blow 
that would end their season when the Broncos jumped on them early.  
</P>
<P>
 Elam's field goals of 52 and 24 yards, and a 27-yard touchdown pass from John 
Elway to Cedric Tillman gave Denver a 13-0 lead early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler responded with a four-yard touchdown pass to Brown. But Elway 
answered with a 54-yard scoring pass to Shannon Sharpe, and Denver, losers of 
seven of the last eight against the Raiders and five in a row at the Coliseum 
before Sunday, was ahead, 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jaeger's 43-yard field goal, Elway and Sharpe connected on another 
scoring pass play, this one from a yard out, and the Broncos, appeared to have 
control at 27-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 24 seconds remained in the half when Hostetler got the ball at the Raider 
36. He connected on three consecutive passes to set up Jaeger, who came through 
with a 50-yard field goal on the final play.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Raiders appeared to be in trouble. They would need more than 27 
points to win, a total they hadn't exceeded all season. With Greg Robinson 
already out with a knee injury, the loss of Jordan would further hamper a 
running game that had accounted for 31 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 And Elway and Sharpe were destroying the Raiders' secondary, having connected 
on four passes for 91 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Elam opened the third quarter with a 27-yard field goal to extend the 
Broncos' lead to 30-13. It was Denver's sixth possession and the sixth score. 
</P>
<P>
 And the last. Denver was not heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Raiders were only getting started. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler and Brown combined on a 24-yard touchdown pass to make it 30-20 
heading into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger kicked a 39-yard field goal to make it 30-23 with 9:33 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 With 2:59 remaining in regulation, Hostetler took over at the Raider 30.  
</P>
<P>
 With 17 seconds left, the Raiders had a first and goal at the Bronco four. 
</P>
<P>
 A pass to Ethan Horton was incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 A pass to Jett was just out of the back of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Hostetler faded back for the last play in regulation. Perhaps the 
last play this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He looked left. Brown was covered. James Jett was covered. Than he look right. 
Wright had shed his defender for an instant and was standing at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all Hostetler needed. He fired. Wright dove into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock showed 0:00. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright showed the crowd the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders weren't dead yet. Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Brown set a Raider record for wide receivers with 80 catches for the 
season. . . . With 15 points Sunday, Jeff Jaeger finished with a team-record 
132.

 It was 4:36 Sunday afternoon at the Coliseum. It is normally a time when the 
Raiders, win or lose, have finished playing for the day and a calm has settled 
over the empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
 But not this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Every seat was still filled, it was anything but calm and the Raiders were 
still out there, fighting to stave off sudden death and find new life in the 
postseason by beating the Denver Broncos.

LAKERS HIT BOTTOM AFTER LOSS TO SPURS; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY FALL INTO LAST 
PLACE AS SAN ANTONIO CAN'T GIVE GAME AWAY, 94-92. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A new year, a new view. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers opened 1994 by slipping into the most unfamiliar of territory, the 
basement in the Pacific Division, seventh place. Having to look up to find 
Sacramento might have been the strangest sight of Sunday night were it not for 
how they got there, a 94-92 loss to the San Antonio Spurs at the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers got almost every break possible in the final second and still 
couldn't avoid their 11th loss in 13 games. A potentially critical mistake from 
a veteran who should have known better, Terry Cummings. A chance for overtime 
despite missing two free throws with 0.6 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 They got almost every break, but they didn't get a bounce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was right there," Coach Randy Pfund said. "It was one of those nights when 
it seemed like everything fit for us to steal one. But the key didn't fit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs had a 94-92 lead when David Robinson went to the line with one 
second remaining. He missed the first attempt, then decided to miss the second 
on purpose, figuring the Lakers wouldn't have enough time to grab the rebound, 
call a timeout and get a decent play. What Robinson, who finished with 36 
points and 12 rebounds, didn't figure was Cummings committing a loose-ball foul 
on James Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers suddenly had a gift, a chance to force overtime. But when Edwards 
missed the first try with six-tenths of a second to go, the strategy changed. 
Like Robinson moments before, he had to miss the second on purpose and hope for 
the right bounce. 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't have been a better bounce, even though the ball ricocheted off the 
backboard instead of getting the high bounce off the rim Edwards desired. But 
when the rebound went to Elden Campbell on the right side of the lane, and when 
Campbell had control with his right hand and pushed the ball the couple of feet 
toward the rim, the Lakers were still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as quickly, though, they were done. Campbell's tip banked long, and the 
Lakers were finally out of last chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt we were going to win," Robinson said. "Stupid things just kept 
holding us back." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Peeler led the Lakers with 27 points, 10 in the fourth quarter. 
Campbell had 14 points and 12 rebounds, marking his first double-doubles in 
back-to-back games. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers continue to call his injury a sprained left knee, but Sam Bowie 
said doctors last week discovered bone chips or fragments in the joint and that 
surgery will be needed at some point. It's a matter of whether he can wait 
until after the season. "I want to see the response from rest," said Bowie, who 
sat out his fourth consecutive game. "If I would have continued to feel the way 
I did four days ago, I would have gotten it done. But the pain has subsided to 
the point that, because I'm an optimist, I am hopeful of being able to wait 
until summer. But I'm going to have to get it done either way." The decision is 
Bowie's, and he said doctors have told him an operation could mean anywhere 
from three weeks to three months on the sidelines. Said Coach Randy Pfund: "I 
just know we need him back, if at all possible." . . . The Lakers are 11 games 
below .500 for the first time since the end of the 1974-75 season, when they 
finished 30-52. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio's Dennis Rodman was ejected with 8:49 left and the Spurs ahead by 
five points. It was the third time he has been kicked out this season. Rodman 
argued vehemently with official David Jones after getting the second technical 
foul, had to be restrained by teammates and coaches and, when he finally did 
head off the court, threw a gym bag from in front of the Laker bench and pushed 
aside a police officer assigned to walk to the locker room with him. "That 
stuff just can't happen," San Antonio's David Robinson said. "But I agree with 
Dennis because he didn't deserve the second technical. But I guess his body 
motions were threatening and the ref said he didn't need that. That reputation 
gets around the league and it can be a burden for us later on."

NEWSWIRE: TRADE OF THOMAS TO KNICKS IS CALLED NEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guard Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons appears headed to the New York 
Knicks in a trade for forward Tony Campbell and the Knicks' first-round draft 
pick in June, the Detroit Free Press reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who joined Detroit in 1981 and was an all-star his first 12 seasons, 
and Piston owner William Davidson declined to confirm the deal, but said they 
plan to meet soon. Sources told the Free Press that if Thomas didn't get what 
he wanted at the meeting, reportedly a lucrative contract, he would accept a 
trade to the Knicks. Thomas is in the last year of a contract that is paying 
him $2.4 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Piston spokesman Matt Dobek said he knew nothing about a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, 32, who helped lead the Pistons to two NBA championships, hasn't 
played since Dec. 21 because of a toe injury. He is averaging 14.3 points and 
9.0 assists in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell has a pinched nerve in his left foot and sat out Sunday night's game 
against Charlotte, but the injury is not considered serious. The 6-foot-7 
forward, in his 10th season, was a Piston from 1984-87 and also has played for 
the Lakers and Minnesota Timberwolves. Campbell is averaging 7.1 points in 22 
games, but he played little until the Knicks' recent run of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 New York is in need of backcourt leadership because of the season-ending knee 
injury two weeks ago to point guard Doc Rivers. The Knicks also have been 
hampered by injuries to guard Hubert Davis and forwards Charles Smith, Anthony 
Mason and Campbell. Tennis

Siemerink, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, as the seventh-seeded Swiss defeated the Netherlands, 
3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Hlasek and Maleeva-Fragniere also beat the Dutch duo, 8-6, in a mixed-doubles 
match that was reduced to one set. 
</P>

 Anke Huber defeated Amanda Coetzer, 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 6-1, and Bernd Karbacher

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Happy Raider assistant coach on the way down the press box elevator late 
Sunday afternoon at the Coliseum: "See you guys here next week." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Not-so-happy Denver assistant: "Yeah." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum continues to be the Broncos' house of horrors, the place where 
they have lost six consecutive games and must open the playoffs after their 
come-from-ahead, overtime defeat Sunday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Another capacity crowd will give the Raiders a legitimate home-field 
advantage, something they do not always enjoy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The fans made a difference," Raider linebacker Joe Kelly said. "We fed off 
them in the second half. I wish we could have this kind of support every week." 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The way the fans were celebrating on the way out of the stadium, you would 
have thought Wisconsin had just won the Rose Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hostetler out-John Elwayed John Elway in perhaps the most exciting Raider 
game at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't be here without Jeff," Howie Long said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He could have meant Hostetler or Jaeger. Take your pick. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos didn't punt until 1:36 was left in the third quarter, but didn't 
score during the last 32 minutes 41 seconds. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We got more aggressive," Long said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to the much-maligned Art Shell and his staff for some superb 
second-half play calling. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This time, it was the Broncos who went into a shell, running the ball three 
consecutive times and wasting Elway's abilities on what turned out to be their 
last possession of the second half. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Off their performances in bowl games, the Rams might want to draft quarterback 
Trent Dilfer of Fresno State instead of Heath Shuler of Tennessee if they have 
a choice. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ever imagine that you would feel sorry for Notre Dame? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Irish were robbed in the polls. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The true national championship was decided on the field Nov. 13 when Notre 
Dame beat Florida State, 31-24. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Both the Irish and Seminoles lost one game. The first tiebreaker in nearly 
every league or conference is head-to-head competition. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Granted, Florida State was 12-1 and Notre Dame 11-1. But I suspect the Irish 
would have been able to handle the team, Kansas, that the Seminoles played in 
their extra game, the Kickoff Classic. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Orange Bowl officiating crew might have decided the mythical 
national title. Without a controversial call or two that worked against 
Nebraska, the Cornhuskers would have won and finished as the country's only 
unbeaten team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Bowden nearly became the first losing coach ever to get a victory shower 
on the sidelines. . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The difference in the Rose Bowl was that Wisconsin wanted to win more than 
UCLA. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Cook was not at full strength after a bout with flu, but the Badgers' 
ferocious hitting also had something do with UCLA's six turnovers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Trash talking has no place in the game, something I believe Terry Donahue will 
emphasize to his players during his next preseason speech. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin, under Barry Alvarez, was the best-coached Big Ten team Pasadena has 
seen in many a year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Associated Press writer John Nadel surveyed the sea of red-and-white and said, 
"Apparently, a lot of UCLA fans sold their tickets and are watching the game on 
TV sets they bought with the proceeds." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Don't look now, but the Big Ten has a modest two-game Rose Bowl winning 
streak. . . . 
</P>

MIGHTY DUCKS EXPAND HIT PARADE IN FLORIDA; HOCKEY: THEY FINALLY PICK ON SOMEONE 
THEIR OWN SIZE IN HANDING TAMPA BAY A 4-1 DEFEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It took almost half a season and nine tries, but the Mighty Ducks finally won 
a game against one of the NHL's other recent expansion teams Sunday, beating 
Tampa Bay, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will be this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the parade was already scheduled -- the Disney-owned Ducks will be 
waving at tourists at Disney's MGM Studios attraction here today in their third 
parade of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 This, for a 15-24-2 expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a win like tonight, it will certainly be a little easier to sit there 
not having lost three in a row, or four out of five or whatever it would be, 
and have a parade, when usually they're reserved for championship teams," Coach 
Ron Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have more parades than the Montreal Canadiens," said General Manager Jack 
Ferreira, whose team rode Disneyland floats twice before they even played a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' performance against the Lightning before 10,871 in one of five 
"home" games Tampa Bay is playing at Orlando Arena, was not aesthetically 
pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the worst we played all year, by a mile, but we won," Wilson said. 
"I guess we have to play lousy against the new teams and we'll win, instead of 
playing good and losing." 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay Coach Terry Crisp couldn't find much positive in his team's 
performance, after the Lighting allowed Garry Valk to score the eventual 
game-winning goal with the Ducks shorthanded at 14:03 of the third off an 
assist from Bob Corkum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lighting has given up an NHL-worst 14 shorthanded goals, and is only 
plus-11 on its own power play, with 25 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't make the '93-'94 blooper tape at least 16 times, nobody will," 
Crisp said. "They'll be able to sell a lot of tapes to us, because we'll be on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Goaltender Ron Tugnutt had the game's best performance, stopping 31 shots and 
bidding for his second shutout in three starts until Chris Joseph scored on a 
power play with 5:57 to play.  
</P>
<P>
 "When we were ahead 2-0, at that time I was thinking shutout," Tugnutt said. 
"I wanted it, but the first most important thing is the win, and that's what we 
got." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Yake gave the Ducks some breathing room with a 3-1 lead at 17:49 of the 
third when he poke-checked the puck away from Adam Creighton in the neutral 
zone and slapped it home from the top of the right circle for his 15th goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Douris added an empty-netter with 40 seconds left after Crisp pulled 
goalie Daren Puppa for an extra attacker. Defenseman David Williams opened the 
Ducks' scoring on a first-period rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Sunday, the Ducks were 0-8 against Florida, Tampa Bay, Ottawa and San 
Jose and 14-16-2 against the established teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the goal differential was in those other games, they could 
have gone either way," Valk said. "You know, Wilson was a little growly 
tonight, in between each period. He really wanted this one bad and I think 
that's why the boys came out and played with a little more aggressiveness than 
we usually do." 
</P>
<P>
 Valk had motivation of his own. When the teams played at Anaheim Arena on Dec. 
5, he was cross-checked into the boards from behind by Tampa Bay's Joe Reekie 
and knocked cold, suffering a concussion that caused him to miss five of the 
next seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did what I felt was a cheap shot, but you know, it happens to everybody I 
guess," said Valk, whose goal was his first since the injury. "A few guys said, 
you know, if you get a chance, maybe have a little talk with him. For me the 
number one thing was to win this game, try to get myself going, try to get the 
team going. If it would have come to that, I would have done it, but we had a 
lot of guys stepping forward tonight."

SPOTLIGHT / A GLANCE AT THIS WEEK IN THE NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 OUR IRREGULAR SEASON WRAP-UP SHOW 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen weeks of injuries, fumbles, fops, flops and occasional flashes of the 
fantastic are just about history (the pre -Fox network NFL history), and we 
feel the need to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular season? No way. The 1993 season was as irregular as Paul Brown or 
George Halas could have ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts, Falcons, Buccaneers, Cardinals, Browns and the rest of their lot 
are retired until next summer, but really, weren't they the fun part of this 
goofy season? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, the handful of actual good teams continue on proudly, as classically 
showcased by one of the few good, meaningful games of 1993: the Cowboys-Giants 
division championship clash. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was not a season for great games. This was a season for the mediocre, 
for backup quarterbacks, for December fades, for, well, losers. 
</P>
<P>
 MOST EXCITING / MOST DISAPPOINTING 
</P>
<P>
 We start with the positive, just to get it over quickly, which is easily done. 
Our completely subjective list of the happiest developments of Irregular Season 
1993: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Two running backs who you never heard of until they kept flashing up on the 
"SportsCenter" highlights in run-and-shoot offenses: Houston's Gary Brown (who 
gained over 1,000 yards in only 10 games) and Atlanta's Erric Pegram. Brown 
needed an injury to Lorenzo White, and Pegram just needed Coach Jerry Glanville 
to have one of his rare bursts of sanity to prove that the run-and-shoot is 
deadly dull without real running backs. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Two old men: Phil Simms of the Giants and Marcus Allen of the Chiefs. We 
thought both of them left their best healthy days behind them in the '80s, but 
both made it through strong, successful and making fools out of everybody who 
gave up on them. Joe Montana was slightly less successful at this. 
</P>
<P>
 3. All those rookie running backs: Has there ever been a draft class that was 
so good so fast? Jerome Bettis, Natrone Means, Reggie Brooks, Greg Robinson, 
Ronald Moore, Terry Kirby. . . . And that's not even counting the class' top 
selection, Garrison Hearst, who may or may not begin and end his career at 
Wounded Knee. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Buddy Ryan and the Houston Oilers: Politically incorrect. Cocky. 
Intimidating. Downright mean, sometimes. Gee, you mean those qualities actually 
are helpful in football? 
</P>
<P>
 5. Jerry Rice and Sterling Sharpe: Who says wide receivers can't dominate 
games? 
</P>
<P>
 The most disappointing:  
</P>
<P>
 1. Jeff George: Began year as a crybaby holdout, which turned out to be the 
highlight for him. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Barry Foster: Think Walter Payton ever missed a crucial stretch drive 
because of a sore ankle? Has Emmitt Smith? Barry, running backs get hit. The 
great ones get up. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Anybody in a Redskin uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 4. The NFC as a whole: So bad that they let not one, not two, but three 
mediocre Central Division teams into the postseason. Inexcusable. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's your first-round matchups: No offense Vikings vs. no offense Giants. 
Wildly inconsistent Packers vs. wildly inconsistent Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Jim Everett: You saw it. Made T.J. Rubley, Mark Rypien and Jeff George seem 
bold, courageous and brilliant by comparison. If he was in any other town, he'd 
be retired by now. Pretty soon, he will be in another town. 
</P>
<P>
 MOMENTS FOR THE TIME CAPSULE 
</P>
<P>
 The best of 1993, the worst of 1993:  
</P>
<P>
 1. Was Cleveland Coach Bill Belichick content with a team that overachieved to 
be 5-2 in the first half of the season and a gutty, if not quite graceful 
quarterback leading the way? 
</P>
<P>
 Noooo. Instead, he abruptly released folk-hero Bernie Kosar before Vinny 
Testaverde was healthy enough to start, and went with Todd Philcox for several 
painful, season-busting weeks and blamed the fans, the media and probably the 
military-industrial complex for conspiring against him. Story of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Leon Lett: He's living his own "Groundhog Day" existence, cursed to relive 
his grand mistakes on national television, every year, over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Backup quarterbacks: Randall Cunningham and Dan Marino were lost early in 
the year, and, eventually, so were both of their teams, who tried to make it 
happen with the likes of Bubby Brister, Ken O'Brien and Steve DeBerg. Dave 
Krieg backed up in the shadow of Montana and fell down. 
</P>
<P>
 4. You have got to love consistency, and you have got to love the Saints and 
the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints, all dressed up with no flair to go, are the epitome of what is 
dreary about the NFL. They win just enough to lose when it counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers, exciting in a sloppy way, lose just enough to win when it 
means nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 4. The Oilers: This year, a 1-4 start is a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 5. The NFC on Fox: Is it true that Rupert Murdoch has the option of striking 
the NFC Central from existence and replacing them with the "Melrose Place" 
gang? 
</P>
<P>
 WHO NEEDS THE PLAYOFFS WHEN YOU'RE A LEGEND? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing quite becomes a coaching monument more than stomping down the 
backstretch with a five-game losing streak, we always say. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so long ago, those mighty Don Shula Dolphins were 9-2, he was hailed as 
the greatest coach since Vince Lombardi ( better! ), and the sentimental 
Shula-ites demanded that the Dolphins be universally acclaimed the AFC's Super 
Bowl representative this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, didn't Shula deserve it? Hall of Fame? Get Mt. Rushmore ready! 
</P>
<P>
 Oops. Turns out, they had to actually win a game or two to do it, maybe play 
defense a teeny bit, and all that proved to be too much, All-Time Coaching 
Record or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Needing only one victory among their final five games to clinch a playoff 
spot, the Dolphins coughed and gagged. 
</P>
<P>
 Needing only to defeat the New England Patriots on Sunday, the Dolphins -- the 
Don Shula Dolphins -- got tracked down from behind not once but twice in the 
waning moments by Drew Bledsoe, Michael Timpson, Ben Coates and a whole bunch 
of other guys not coached by Shula and not anywhere close to a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Just an aside: Since he almost certainly will not be performing at Super Bowl 
XXVIII in any situation more compelling than kicking field goals at the "NFL 
Experience" tent, Shula now has gone nine years without a Super berth. 
</P>
<P>
 His last trip: after the 1984 season, when his Dolphins were bombed by the 
49ers. His last Super win? After the 1973 season . . . 20 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 PATRIOT GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Patriots -- Bill Parcells, Bledsoe, four-game winning streak 
and all -- might have played their last game in the Boston area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few days, the Massachusetts legislature is expected to act on a 
bill to finance a proposed domed stadium in downtown Boston to replace creaky 
Sullivan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 If the legislature votes for the stadium, observers say, the Patriots will 
stay. If it doesn't, owner James Orthwein might sell the team to St. Louis 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 After all those bad years, the Patriots may be moving exactly at a time when 
their future seems brightest. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD SEEDS 
</P>
<P>
 Here come the playoffs, and boy are we ready for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it's so fun in the NCAA college basketball tournament, we thought we'd 
go ahead and draw up some seedings for January Madness: 
</P>
<P>
 NFC 
</P>
<P>
 1. Dallas: If any other of the playoff teams had Emmitt Smith, they'd be No. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 2. San Francisco: Their defense couldn't handle Dallas last year, and nothing 
has improved this year. 
</P>
<P>
 3. New York: Losing the bye is devastating. Will get even more banged up 
against Minnesota this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Green Bay: Best of the rest, which doesn't mean much if Brett Favre is 
going to throw four interceptions every other week. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Minnesota: The defense can win it games, and Jim McMahon won't lose any. 
But can you see them winning three times on the road? 
</P>
<P>
 6. Detroit: Division-winners, yes. Can they beat Packers back-to-back weeks? 
Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 AFC 
</P>
<P>
 1. Houston: Double-digit winning streaks keyed by a swarming defense and a 
strong running attack heading into January will always get those post-season 
gods to smile down at you. Love those battling coordinators, too. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Buffalo: It'll be cold, Houston will jump out to a big AFC Championship 
Game lead and nope, Frank Reich won't be able to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Kansas City: Tough game in first round (either Jets or Steelers) makes 
going the distance a tough go, especially with fragile Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Denver: John Elway has the ball, clock running down . . .  
</P>
<P>
 5. Raiders: Sorry, if you can't run the ball, you don't win many games in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Pittsburgh: The mental strain of just making it leaves them vulnerable for 
the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 BITS AND PIECES 
</P>
<P>
 Though it feels very wrong to put these two in the same sentence, Pittsburgh 
quarterback Neal O'Donnell took aim at some of Terry Bradshaw's Steeler records 
Sunday. O'Donnell finished the season having completed 270 of his 486 passes, 
breaking Bradshaw's 1979 team records of 259 completions and 472 attempts. . . 
. Marshall Faulk, the former San Diego State running back who is expected to be 
one of the top players selected in this spring's college draft, was at the 
Bengals-Saints game in New Orleans. Cincinnati, which finished 3-13, will have 
the top selection. Asked about playing for the Bengals, Faulk said it would be 
like college. Marshall, the Bengals are a lot like college.

SMITH SHOULDERS LOAD FOR COWBOYS; NFC: HE PLAYS DESPITE A SEPARATED SHOULDER 
AND LEADS HIS TEAM TO OVERTIME VICTORY OVER GIANTS, GIVING THEM DIVISION TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After Emmitt Smith carried the Dallas Cowboys to a division title Sunday on a 
shoulder that belonged in a sling, he offered disbelievers a reminder. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the shoulder had been separated. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart," Smith said, "is as big as the world." 
</P>
<P>
 At least , the amazed New York Giants responded after watching a one-armed man 
lead the Cowboys to a 16-13 overtime victory before a Giants Stadium record 
crowd of 77,356. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see him walk off the field holding his arm, and we think he is hurt," 
Giant linebacker Michael Brooks said. "But he still ran through us." 
</P>
<P>
 And now the NFC's road to the Super Bowl runs through Dallas, where the 
defending Super Bowl champion Cowboys (12-4) will remain throughout the 
playoffs after taking next week off as a reward for their NFC East 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a whole new era, hoss," crowed Nate Newton, Cowboy guard. "We're like 
Jack Nicklaus when he's got his swing. There's nothing nobody can do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants (11-5), finishing second in a division they led during all but the 
last day of the season, were granted a home playoff game next Sunday against 
wild-card entrant Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys' second consecutive East title was officially won when Eddie 
Murray kicked a 41-yard field goal with 6:43 remaining in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 But the game was really decided when Smith, after separating his shoulder with 
1:58 left in the first half on a crushing tackle by Greg Jackson, answered a 
halftime question from trainer Kevin O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain was so bad, I couldn't even describe it," Smith said. "But when 
Kevin asked me if I wanted to come out, I told him, 'I'm not coming out. I've 
got to play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking, 'Man, now that my shoulder is hurt, we really got to win so I 
can get that week off.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And so he played, finishing with 229 yards rushing and receiving while doing 
most of the work on the Cowboys game-winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith gained 59 of those yards and made four of his 10 catches after the 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 This is even though he couldn't carry the ball in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Or stretch out to catch a high pass. Or even pick himself up off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came into the huddle and said, 'Guys, whenever I get tackled, somebody has 
to help me get up,' " Newton said. "The man is like a mule. As long as he's 
standing, he's working." 
</P>
<P>
 The pain was so much, it appeared that his right arm was taped to his body 
throughout the second half. He was afraid to move it unless forced. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the game's end, Smith's 168 rushing yards had cemented his third 
consecutive NFL rushing title, giving him 1,486 yards even though he did not 
play in two games and had only one carry in another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt I can come up with an adjective to describe him that has not already 
been used before," Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's inability to go full speed allowed to Giants to turn a 13-0 deficit 
into a 13-13 tie in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Cowboys held on the first possession of the overtime, they begged 
Smith for his last ounce of strength. 
</P>
<P>
 With a knee pad taped to his shoulder for extra protection, he gave it to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 On their game-winning 52-yard drive, Smith touched the ball on nine of the 12 
plays, including the final five plays before the field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 On a darting 10-yard run one play before Murray's field goal, he even 
stiff-armed a defender with his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I touched the ball, I hurt," Smith said. "Every time somebody 
would come to pick me up after I was tackled, I would tell them I was OK. But I 
was lying." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys did not apologize for using Smith, even though they could not 
guarantee that he caused further damage to the shoulder, which will be 
re-examined today. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Emmitt can hold the ball, even hold it with his face mask, we want him out 
there," Aikman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The game raised the first questions here about Coach Dan Reeves' conservative 
style of play. It was those questions that ultimately caused him to be fired 
last year in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants appeared to settle for a tying field goal in the final minute of 
regulation instead of going for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants, outgained 238-68 during the first half while Smith was sound, 
pushed back into the game with an 11-play touchdown drive early in the third 
quarter after Kevin Williams dropped a punt for the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 They added a field goal by David Treadwell later in the quarter, and then 
mounted a 69-yard drive late in the game. During that drive, an 11-yard run by 
Rodney Hampton gave them the ball at the Cowboy 22-yard line with 1:09 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But then it appeared Reeves settled for the tie. Hampton ran around end for 
three yards on first down, then off tackle for four yards on second down, then 
Phil Simms threw a one-yard pass to Aaron Pierce on third down. 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell's 31-yard field goal tied the game with 10 seconds remaining but 
what if . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could see what you guys see now, that the score was 16-13, yeah, I would 
have taken a shot at trying to score with a pass," Reeves said sarcastically 
during a sometimes bitter postgame press conference.  
</P>
<P>
 "(The media) is unbelievable. You all are the best second-guessers I have ever 
seen."

OVERTIME LOSS ENDS DOLPHINS' SEASON; AFC: BLEDSOE PASSES FOR FOUR TOUCHDOWNS AS 
NEW ENGLAND ELIMINATES MIAMI FROM THE PLAYOFFS, 33-27. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five weeks after having the NFL's best record, the Miami Dolphins ended their 
regular season Sunday in a tailspin as they were eliminated from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Bledsoe's fourth touchdown pass of the game, with 4:44 gone in overtime, 
gave the New England Patriots a 33-27 victory over Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins' fifth consecutive loss condemned them to waiting to see if they 
could back into an AFC wild-card spot. They couldn't. The Raiders' overtime 
victory over the Denver Broncos saw to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "After having the season that we had going for us, and then not being able to 
win -- especially these last two weeks when we knew we had to win to clinch and 
not being able to do it -- is just a disappointment that we're going to have to 
live with," Miami Coach Don Shula said, "and that's something that's going to 
be tough to handle." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami (9-7) was 9-2 after winning in icy Dallas on Thanksgiving, but went into 
a collapse that included three home defeats. The five-game losing streak 
matches the Dolphins' longest during Shula's 24 years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe, who was 27 for 43 for 329 yards, completed a 36-yard scoring pass to 
Michael Timpson for the winning score as the Patriots (5-11) won their fourth 
in a row. It was only the third time in the 1990s that New England has defeated 
a team with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins couldn't stop Bledsoe, who finished his rookie season with 2,494 
passing yards and 15 touchdowns despite missing three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of the most exciting games I've ever coached in," Patriot Coach 
Bill Parcells said. "Miami wouldn't die easily. They had too much at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 The winning touchdown was set up by a freaky play. Vincent Brisby fumbled 
after catching a 13-yard pass, but Russell picked up the loose ball and rumbled 
another 22 yards to the Miami 36. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins rallied several times in the second half to send the game into 
overtime. Pete Stoyanovich kicked a 24-yard field goal with six seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams combined for 27 points in a wild fourth quarter. Trailing, 17-10, 
the Dolphins tied the score when Mitchell completed a nine-yard pass to Mark 
Ingram after a blocked punt by Darrell Malone. 
</P>
<P>
 New England regained the lead on Matt Bahr's 37-yard field goal, but Miami 
went ahead, 24-20, on Terry Kirby's 15-yard run. Bledsoe responded with an 
11-yard pass to Ben Coates to put the Patriots ahead, 27-24, with 1:14 left in 
regulation.

NO PLACE LIKE HOME FOR BILLS; AFC: BUFFALO'S 30-10 VICTORY OVER INDIANAPOLIS 
CLINCHES HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE THROUGHOUT THE PLAYOFFS.

 The Buffalo Bills are staying home for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman Thomas rushed for 110 yards and one touchdown and Jim Kelly and Frank 
Reich each passed for one touchdown Sunday as the Bills beat the Indianapolis 
Colts, 30-10, to earn home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we earned it," Kelly said. "Definitely, we earned it this year to be 
in the position we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo (12-4) finished with four victories in a row for the first time since 
1973 and earned a first-round bye in its bid for a fourth consecutive trip to 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very big," Kelly said. "Especially the week off. I'm kind of sore, and 
some other players I know are, too. Any time you play in our back yard with the 
weather conditions and those 80,000 crazy people, it's definitely a plus for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis (4-12), which lost four fumbles, ended with its eighth loss in 
nine games. A 10-yard touchdown pass from Jeff George to Jessie Hester with 
6:55 left was only the Colts' second touchdown in the last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo led, 10-3, at halftime, but added field goals of 49 and 40 yards by 
Steve Christie in the third quarter and put the game out of reach with Kelly's 
one-yard touchdown pass to Pete Metzelaars early in the fourth. Reich completed 
a 30-yard scoring pass to Bill Brooks less than two minutes later after an 
Indianapolis fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, whose last 100-yard game had been six weeks earlier, also against the 
Colts, ran three yards for the Bills' first touchdown late in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Roosevelt Potts led the Colts with 100 yards rushing, but fumbled once 
to set up Christie's third field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 George completed 30 of 48 passes for 330 yards, but was sacked four times. 
Kelly completed 15 of 27 passes for 125 yards. The touchdown pass to Brooks was 
the only attempt for Reich, who replaced Kelly in the final quarter.

TIMELY TIRADE HELPS STEELERS BEAT BROWNS; AFC: LINEBACKER GREG LLOYD INSPIRES 
TEAMMATES AS PITTSBURGH RALLIES AND ENDS UP IN THE PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers' offense didn't get going until Greg Lloyd got mad. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers, motivated by Lloyd's expletive-filled halftime tirade, kept 
their playoff hopes alive on Neil O'Donnell's fourth-quarter touchdown pass to 
Eric Green to beat the Cleveland Browns, 16-9, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, coupled with the New York Jets' loss to the Oilers gave 
Pittsburgh the AFC's sixth and final playoff berth. The Steelers will play 
Kansas City Saturday at 9:30 a.m. PST. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers ended a seven-quarter streak without a touchdown on Green's 
14-yard catch with 7:16 remaining. Until then, Pittsburgh had managed only two 
Gary Anderson field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lloyd came in at halftime and was like a caged animal," center Dermontti 
Dawson said. "When a leader like him speaks the truth, you've got to respect 
what he says and respond. He was the key to us winning." 
</P>
<P>
 After Lloyd's outburst, the Steelers fought off a 9-3 deficit, a two-game 
losing streak and an offense that hadn't scored a touchdown since Dec. 19 to 
beat Cleveland (7-9) for the 20th time in 24 games at Three Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd said he challenged the Steelers' offense -- held without a touchdown for 
the third time this season in a 16-6 loss to Seattle last week -- to win the 
game. Lloyd did his part by forcing two of the Browns' four fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't give a jack if anybody got (mad)," Lloyd said. "They were messing 
with the playoffs, messing with my money. We were sitting back playing their 
style. (The Browns) weren't ready to play. They were playing just well enough 
not to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd said some Steelers acted as if "they were thinking about getting on a 
plane after the game" and not the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them to step it up," he said. "I'm out there busting my rear, and 
we've got guys on (offense) who were 100% healthy sitting back. That may cut it 
in high school, but it won't cut it here. I told the offense they had to spark 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell, despite being sacked seven times, was 22 of 39 for 226 yards, with 
Green making six catches.

OILERS PUNCH THE JETS OUT OF PLAYOFFS, 24-0; AFC: CODY CARLSON LEADS HOUSTON TO 
ITS 11TH WIN IN A ROW, A 24-0 VICTORY THAT ELIMINATES NEW YORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reserve quarterback Cody Carlson guided the Houston Oilers to a 24-0 victory 
over the New York Jets Sunday night, knocking the Jets out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory stretched Houston's (12-4) winning streak to 11 games. The Oilers 
already had secured a first-round bye and a home game for the second round of 
the playoffs. It was Houston's first ever 12-victory season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets (8-8) could have reached the playoffs with a victory, but their loss 
sent the Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7) against Kansas City next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth time in the last six games the Jets scored seven points or 
fewer. They lost their last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were beaten by a superior team," Jet Coach Bruce Coslet said. "That's 
unfortunate, because we were playing for a playoff spot. Maybe we're just not 
there yet. This is the first time we've had our rear ends handed to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers and Jets scuffled on the field several times in the first quarter, 
but the real brawl was on the Oilers' sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan took a punch at offensive coordinator Kevin 
Gilbride shortly after Houston got the ball with 37 seconds left in the half. 
Instead of running out the clock, Carlson attempted two passes, fumbling the 
second attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets' Bill Pickel recovered at Houston's 18 with 24 seconds to play, 
giving the Jets a chance to score before the half. But the Jets missed a field 
goal and Houston led 14-0 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 After the squabble between Ryan and Gilbride cooled down, the Oilers set about 
dispatching the Jets, who also were shut out in the their finale last season, 
against New Orleans. New York gained 169 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson, subbing for injured Warren Moon, directed the Oilers to a 14-0 
halftime lead and made it look easy, going to 22 yards to Ernest Givins and 
eight yards to Gary Brown for the scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson, playing despite a groin injury that hampered his running ability, 
completed 23 of 38 passes for 247 yards. Moon is sidelined with a broken rib, 
but he's expected to be ready for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This keeps the momentum going, but we have to learn from our mistakes," 
Carlson said. "We have to polish some things offensively, but it is a good 
feeling to win and keep the streak going." 
</P>
<P>
 A 38-yard field goal by Al Del Greco in the third quarter made it 17-0, then 
Brown ran 16 yards for the final touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown gained 85 yards Sunday to go over 1,000 yards, despite starting only 
seven games. He finished with 1,002. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers recorded a team-record six sacks, including four on Esiason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think they were in the upper echelons of the top two or three 
teams," Esiason said. "but tonight they made a believer out of me."

CARNEY, DEFENSE LEAD THE CHARGERS; INTERCONFERENCE: KICKER'S FOUR FIELD GOALS 
PLUS TWO LATE INTERCEPTIONS GIVE SAN DIEGO A 32-17 VICTORY OVER TAMPA BAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 John Carney gave San Diego the lead for good, then the Chargers' defense took 
over in the last six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a 32-17 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney's fourth field goal, a 45-yarder in a light rain, put the Chargers 
ahead, 19-17, with 6:17 remaining. Then Duane Young and Natrone Means scored 
touchdowns that were set up by interceptions as San Diego broke open a close 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrien Gordon's interception, which appeared to hit the ground before he 
scooped it up, led to Young's 12-yard touchdown reception from Stan Humphries, 
who also completed a 48-yard scoring pass to Anthony Miller in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Davis picked off a tipped pass at the Buccaneers' 17 to set up Means' 
15-yard touchdown run with less than two minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego (8-8) finished the season with a two-game winning streak. Tampa Bay 
(5-11) was 3-4 in its last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego, which scored on seven of its first nine possessions en route to a 
45-20 victory over Miami last week, built a 10-0 lead on Carney's 48-yard field 
goal and Humphries' touchdown pass to Miller, who accelerated behind Tampa Bay 
defender Ricky Reynolds to make the catch in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers slowed down the Chargers, taking the ball and holding it for 
the next 10:33 before Michael Husted's 21-yard field goal at the end of a 
19-play, 84-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The extended stay on the sideline seemed to take something out of the San 
Diego offense, which gained 124 yards on its first two possessions. Even after 
Darren Carrington's 28-yard interception return to the Buccaneers' 17 late in 
the second quarter, the Chargers had trouble moving the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney kicked a 38-yard field goal for a 13-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Erickson completed only nine of 23 passes in the first two quarters, but 
regrouped and returned to hit nine of his first 10 after halftime, including a 
20-yard touchdown pass to Lamar Thomas. The Buccaneers' scoring drive began at 
their 36, where the Chargers' John Kidd was smothered for a 10-yard loss on a 
fake field goal.

LIONS, IN FIRST PLACE ALL SEASON, STAY THERE; NFC: THEY WIN DIVISION TITLE WITH 
VICTORY OVER PACKERS. THE SAME TWO TEAMS WILL PLAY IN DETROIT NEXT SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They aren't called Team Trauma for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Lions, with third-stringers Erik Kramer and Eric Lynch leading the 
way, beat the Green Bay Packers, 30-20, Sunday for their second NFC Central 
title in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Lions (10-6) get to play host to the Packers (9-7) in a 
first-round playoff game next Saturday. But it was never easy for the Lions, 
who: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wasted a 7-2 start by losing four of their last seven, including three in a 
row in the Silverdome before the victory over Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Endured three quarterback controversies that took them from Rodney Peete to 
Andre Ware, back to Peete, then finally to Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fired offensive coordinator Dan Henning and replaced him with Dave Levy 
after 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Played their last five games without Barry Sanders and their last 12 
without safety Bennie Blades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long, hard road," said Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes, whose job was 
thought to be on line at the height of the team's tailspin. "I'm just glad to 
be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer, who rescued the Lions in the final half of the 1991 season, completed 
15 of 29 passes for 182 yards with one interception against the Packers. He 
completed an eight-yard touchdown pass to Rodney Holman in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, a free agent from Grand Valley State, is the second fill-in for 
Sanders. Making his second start because backup Derrick Moore has sore ribs, 
Lynch had 115 yards in 30 carries, including touchdowns of five and one yard. 
Lynch also caught four passes for 22 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions' defense, led by All-Pro linebacker Pat Swilling, forced five 
turnovers, including four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been a part of anything like this in eight years," said Swilling, 
who was in the playoffs many times during his days with the New Orleans Saints. 
"This is just great. The stakes are very high now, but that's what it's all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hanson kicked field goals of 37, 53 and 48 yards for the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Favre, second in the NFL with 20 interceptions entering the game, 
completed 23 of 37 for 190 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown pass to Edgar 
Bennett. But the four interceptions were more than the Packers could overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turnovers once again," Packer Coach Mike Holmgren said. "When we've lost 
games this season, that's been the main reason. We were careless with the 
football, and that was the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling Sharpe had six receptions for 33 yards, giving him an NFL-record 112 
catches for the season. He broke his record of 108 receptions in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions held first place since opening day for the first time since the 1954 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted next week's game in Green Bay and they wanted it here," said 
Holmgren, who led the Packers back from a 1-3 start this season. "They got 
their wish."

CARDINALS HOPE VICTORY WILL SAVE BUGEL'S JOB; NFC: BEUERLEIN SETS A FRANCHISE 
RECORD IN 27-10 VICTORY OVER ATLANTA, THEN WONDERS IF HIS COACH WILL BE BACK 
NEXT SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Beuerlein and the Phoenix Cardinals played as if they wanted Coach Joe 
Bugel to keep his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Beuerlein wasn't even aware he set a Phoenix record of 14 consecutive 
completions to start the game as the Cardinals rolled to a 27-10 victory over 
the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure hope so," Beuerlein said when asked if he thought finishing on a 
three-game winning streak saved Bugel's job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a good thing going. We are all adamant that we want it to stay the 
way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 It left the Cardinals (7-9) two games short of owner Bill Bidwill's preseason 
mandate to Bugel -- win this season or lose his job. The Cardinals won four of 
their final five games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do anything we can for Coach Bugel. We aren't just winning because we hate 
to lose, we are trying to make it a habit. It grows," Beuerlein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bugel wouldn't talk about his job, saying only: "I'll be at work tomorrow. 
Whether or not I'm here after that is Mr. Bidwill's decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (6-10) finished with a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Beuerlein completed 27 of 33 passes for 278 yards and three touchdowns -- two 
to Randal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Ron Moore, who didn't start the Cardinals' first five games, carried 32 
times for 96 yards to wind up with 1,018 yards for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Beuerlein started the first possession for Phoenix by completing seven passes, 
including a seven-yarder for a touchdown to Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 One pass fell incomplete on the drive, but Deion Sanders was called for 
holding, negating the play. 
</P>
<P>
 After Erric Pegram, who wound up with 57 yards in 12 carries, fumbled on the 
Atlanta 28 to end the Falcons' second possession, Beuerlein completed three 
passes in a five-play, 26-yard drive, including a nine-yarder to Hill for a 
touchdown. Again, one pass fell incomplete, but an offside by Atlanta nullified 
that play. 
</P>
<P>
 Beuerlein's string came to an end late in the second quarter when, with Ron 
George yanking on his jersey, he tried to pass to Gary Clark in the end zone.

BENGALS LOSE, 20-13, BUT WIN THE FIRST PICK IN THE DRAFT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eric Martin saved the New Orleans Saints from a losing season with a 54-yard 
touchdown reception in a 20-13 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals (3-13) finished with the worst record in the league, which gives 
them the rights to the No. 1 pick in the next draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have to note that progress was made," Bengal Coach David Shula 
said. "The guys got better." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended a four-game losing streak for the Saints, who started the 
year 5-0 before slumping badly to finish 8-8. They are one of only three teams 
since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970 not to make the playoffs after starting 5-0 or 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 It also left them as one of three teams that have not had a losing season in 
the last eight years. The others are San Francisco and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't lose and I'm glad about that, but I can't begin to explain what 
happened to the great year we started out with," cornerback Toi Cook said. 
"This has been a year of what-ifs and disappointments." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints are still the only NFL team without a playoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin had five receptions for 120 yards and the touchdown with 11:06 to play. 
On the game-winner, Martin took a short pass from Walsh and ran to the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, the third-string quarterback since training camp, started for New 
Orleans. First-stringer Wade Wilson was injured two games ago. Backup Mike Buck 
started last week against the Eagles, but was pulled at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh completed 15 of 27 passes for 193 yards and two touchdowns and had one 
interception.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; WISCONSIN MAKES MORE HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wisconsin fans stopped talking about the Rose Bowl around Madison, Wis., for 
about two hours Sunday. Long enough for the Badgers' basketball team to make 
some history of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after Wisconsin's football team won the Rose Bowl for the first time 
in school history, No. 17 Wisconsin (9-0) matched the school's best start in 
basketball since the 1919-20 season with a 71-52 victory over No. 24 Marquette. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin defeated its intrastate rival for the eighth time in nine meetings. 
Wisconsin leads the series, 54-46. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all football fans," Wisconsin Coach Stu Jackson said. "Our guys were 
talking before the game about certain plays from the Rose Bowl without losing 
their own focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always want to know if the football team doing well puts pressure on 
the basketball team. I'm baffled by that. Look at a school like Florida State, 
excellent in both sports. If we can get to that point, that would be great." 
</P>
<P>
 Marquette (7-3) pulled to within 49-43 with 11:03 left, but Wisconsin went on 
a 12-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 North Carolina 116, Marshall 62 -- Dante Calabria scored 20 points to 
lead the Tar Heels at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Six players scored more than 10 points for North Carolina (10-1), which 
extended its winning streak to eight games. Freshman Rasheed Wallace scored 17 
points and had 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall (3-5) led, 9-8, five minutes into the first half, but made only one 
basket the next seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 Temple 67, St. Joseph's 54 -- Aaron McKie scored 24 points and had nine 
rebounds for Temple (6-1, 1-0), which opened Atlantic 10 Conference play with 
the victory at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph's (4-4, 0-2) took an 11-6 lead, but made only one of its next 10 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Purdue 95, San Francisco 81 -- Purdue blew a 20-point lead at Daly 
City, but Glenn Robinson led the Boilermakers to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a quick team," said Robinson, who made six of seven shots in the 
second half. "When you're on the road, things like that will happen. Teams will 
make a run at you." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson finished with 32 points and had 14 rebounds for Purdue (11-0), which 
is off to its best start since the 1911-12 team began 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 69-68, with 9:27 left, Purdue held USF (7-3) scoreless for the final 
3:51. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 14 Connecticut 113, Winthrop 59 -- Reserve Brian Fair scored 25 points to 
lead the Huskies at Storrs, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair, who also had six assists, was one of four players who scored more than 
10 points for Connecticut (10-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Winthrop (1-7) took a 13-7 lead before Connecticut scored 13 consecutive 
points during a 25-5 run. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 22 Illinois 83, Texas 78 -- Deon Thomas scored 23 points to lead Illinois 
(7-2) over the Longhorns (6-5) at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 23 Boston College 90, Coppin State 64 -- Boston College (9-2) closed the 
first half with a 22-2 run en route to the victory over Coppin State (6-7) at 
Newton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 Lamond Murray scored 31 points for California (7-2) in a 94-77 victory over 
St. Mary's at Oakland. . . . Janko Narat scored 24 points, including an 
off-balance shot with 4.8 seconds left to lift Davidson (6-2) to a 64-63 upset 
over North Carolina State (4-6) at Raleigh, N.C., the Wildcats' first victory 
over North Carolina State since 1944.

NBA ROUNDUP; HORNETS OFFER NO PAIN RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Charlotte Hornets are hurting, but it is the New York Knicks who are 
feeling the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets, without leading scorers Alonzo Mourning and Larry Johnson, got 
big performances from role players Eddie Johnson and LeRon Ellis in a 124-123 
overtime victory Sunday at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Johnson scored 18 of his 32 points in the fourth quarter and overtime. 
He made eight of his last 11 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times I get in a zone and it seems like everything I throw up goes in," he 
said. "It was like that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks, without Hubert Davis, Tony Campbell, Anthony Mason, Doc Rivers and 
Charles Smith, had only nine players in uniform. The Detroit Free Press 
reported today that Piston guard Isiah Thomas was headed to the Knicks as part 
of a deal for forward Tony Campbell and the Knicks' No. 1 draft pick in this 
year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis scored 15 points, including a go-ahead three-point play during overtime. 
Hersey Hawkins added 25 points for the Hornets, who have beaten Chicago and New 
York in the last two games without their top two players. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 101, Boston 97 -- The Celtics suffered their fourth consecutive 
home loss for the first time since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Coleman scored 23 points and had 16 rebounds for the Nets, who had won 
only three of their previous 19 games at Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-game home losing streak is the worst by the Celtics at Boston Garden 
since Nov. 3-12, 1978, the season before Larry Bird joined the Celtics. The 
last time the Celtics lost five in a row at home was in the 1949-50 season. 
They will try to avoid matching that streak Friday when they host Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 92, Portland 90 -- The Jazz rallied from a 19-point deficit at Portland 
to extend their winning streak to four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone scored 18 of his 25 points in the second half for the Jazz. He 
made a 15-foot shot with 32 seconds left to give the Jazz a 91-87 cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 96, Denver 80 -- Clarence Weatherspoon had 21 points and 10 
rebounds at Denver as the 76ers ended the Nuggets' five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 119, Dallas 116 -- Lionel Simmons scored 25 points and had 10 
rebounds and eight assists at Sacramento to lead the Kings, who have won three 
in a row to move ahead of the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks cut the lead to 117-116 with 4.7 seconds left after consecutive 
three-point baskets by Tim Legler and Greg Dreiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 93, Detroit 85 -- Rony Seikaly, playing with flu, came off the bench to 
score 18 points at Auburn Hills, Mich., to help the Heat hand the Pistons their 
seventh consecutive loss.

NHL ROUNDUP; WHALERS TURN ON OFFENSE AGAINST THE PENGUINS, 7-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven Hartford Whalers scored and goaltender Sean Burke stopped 34 shots 
Sunday in a 7-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Marchment, Pat Verbeek, Randy Cunneyworth and Michael Nylander each had 
a goal and an assist for the Whalers, who outshot the Penguins, 36-31. The 
Whalers have scored six goals four times this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Sandlak, Robert Kron and Geoff Sanderson added goals for Hartford, which 
held the Penguins scoreless in the first and third periods while scoring four 
times in the final period to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 8, Washington 2 -- Cam Neely recorded the 10th three-goal game of his 
career to lead the Bruins at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The hat trick, Neely's second of the season, gave winger 26 goals in 22 
appearances. His three goals Sunday came on power plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins took a 2-0 lead in the first 56 seconds on goals by Bryan Smolinski 
and Adam Oates. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 4, Calgary 3 -- Craig Janney scored a goal with 1:08 left in 
overtime to give the Blues the victory at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal came after Brett Hull had set a team record for goals as the Blues 
tied the score with 16:31 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hull's 24th goal this season gave him 353, breaking the record held by Bernie 
Federko. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, Winnipeg 1 -- Left wing Jocelyn Lemieux scored three goals and 
added an assist to lead the Blackhawks at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, Vancouver 2 -- Patrick Roy returned in goal after sitting out a 
few games because of a sore back and stopped 28 shots to help the Canadiens win 
at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Muller scored early in the third period to lift the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose 4, Edmonton 4 -- Steve Rice capped a comeback from a two-goal deficit 
with a third-period goal that gave the Oilers the tie a Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Maltby, Zdeno Ciger and Scott Pearson had the other goals for the Oilers, 
who salvaged a point after twice trailing by two goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 3, Buffalo 3 -- Mark Osborne and Dmitri Mironov scored third-period 
goals as the Maple Leafs rallied for the tie at Buffalo to end a four-game 
losing streak.

JACK SMITH: FROM OUT OF THE MOUTH OF BABES -- SOME NEW DEFINITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How children learn language is a mystery to me. Here they are, born into 
culture where words fall all around them like rain. How do they distinguish one 
from another? 
</P>
<P>
 Even before they go to kindergarten, where formal teaching begins, they speak 
and know the meanings of many words. Obviously, they learn some through 
instruction and demonstration. When they're riding down a road, they're told 
it's a road. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the first word children learn is no . 
</P>
<P>
 But I suspect that mostly children learn by textual inference. That is, they 
hear a word among other words, and they guess its meaning from its relation to 
the whole. If a parent tells them, "Beware the dog -- he bites," they already 
know dog and bite , and they guess that beware means watch out for.  
</P>
<P>
 However, textual inference can be very unreliable. It often produces hilarious 
misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year about this time, I am favored with a list of definitions produced 
by the pupils in Joan Maturko's kindergarten class at Jefferson School in 
Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Maturko's method is probably not very scientific. She simply reads a word 
and asks her pupils to define it as best they can. The answers are oral, since 
most of her pupils can't yet write. They demonstrate both the miracle of 
language and its pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 A similarity of sounds may lead some pupils astray. Year after year, for 
example, a few pupils define debate as what their fathers fish with. One pupil 
defined zucchini as a girl's bathing suit. Another, not unreasonably, defined 
adore as "you can close it or open it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some definitions are apt and succinct. Acorn is defined as "a nut that 
squirrels eat." A dictionary could hardly do better. In fact, the American 
Heritage College Dictionary defines acorn as "the fruit of an oak, consisting 
of a single-seeded, thick-walled nut set in a woody, cup-like base." In other 
words, it's a nut that squirrels eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Abstract social concepts are always difficult for children. Marriage inspires 
some oversimplifications as well as some unerring insights: "When somebody is 
getting married to somebody else." "You really like someone, then you love him 
and then you get married." That pupil evidently was a girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Bachelor seems harder to grasp: "Kind of like a bat." "A little bashful." "A 
bachelor party." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, modern technology seems to have displaced simpler meanings. The 
children defined banquet , for example, as "It's when you stand out at the 
ready teller." "It's the bank." "You go to the bank and get money." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently, most of Mrs. Maturko's pupils have never been to a banquet. They 
should consider themselves fortunate never to have endured this boring 
institution. (The most boring of all is a bachelor banquet.) 
</P>
<P>
 The children know almost as much about the brain as I do. "It helps you 
think." "It's something inside your head." "It's so your head can stay on." 
</P>
<P>
 Two definitions for cheap are right on the mark: "You don't have to pay a lot 
of money." "Something doesn't cost a lot of money and when you take it home it 
breaks." That second one is especially good since it neatly encompasses two 
meanings of the word. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty in defining abstract words is plain in the children's 
definitions of jealousy . "Someone is doing something specialer than the other 
person." "You're jealous of sharing your toys with somebody else." "You're 
shy." "You want to be prettier than somebody." The last one may not be a 
sophisticated definition, but it tells you what jealousy means. 
</P>
<P>
 For fun, the pupils say what is fun, rather than what fun is. "You're playing 
and you're having lots of fun." "When people are running all around." "Sliding 
down the slide." "Making friends." "You're being happy." (Today, of course, fun 
is an adjective, as in a fun time .) 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the children haven't been immersed in it enough to know what education 
is. "Information." "You're smart." "You're falling off a cliff." 
</P>
<P>
 To some children, I suppose, education may seem like falling off a cliff, but 
I suspect that that pupil simply didn't associate the word with the process. 
</P>
<P>
 A fascinating definition to me is "Nothing's fair," for equal. Perhaps that 
pupil has heard some debate on television about equal rights and naturally 
supposes that whatever equal rights is, it isn't fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, embarrass is defined as "When somebody sees you in the bathtub." 
That's succinct and to the point. Certainly you're embarrassed when somebody 
sees you in the bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, of course, it's someone you love and want to get married to. 
</P>
<P>
 Being seen in the bathtub is special, but being seen by someone you love is 
specialer.

BOOK REVIEW: TRUE CRIME; UNDERSTANDING THE MIND OF A SERIAL KILLER; KILLING FOR 
COMPANY: THE CASE OF DENNIS NILSEN, BY BRIAN MASTERS (RANDOM HOUSE, $24, 317 
PAGES) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX RAKSIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As demonstrated most recently by the media's fascination with Canada's 
murderous "Ken and Barbie" couple, the most compelling true-crime stories tend 
to be the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde sort, wherein estimable citizens turn out to 
be steeped in iniquity. 
</P>
<P>
 In her "Pictures at an Execution" (Harvard University Press), critic Wendy 
Lesser speculates that we are drawn to such stories because they confirm our 
suspicion that there are hidden dark corners in our lives and in those of our 
loved ones.  
</P>
<P>
 Most true-crime books cash in on this suspicion by shining enough light on 
these shadowy corners to pique our interest but not enough to promote our 
understanding, thus heightening the provocative sense of danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Some true-crime books, though, attempt to pump up the wattage; like a parent 
shining a flashlight under a child's bed, they aim to show us that real 
monsters exist only in our imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Killing for Company" -- the story of Dennis Nilsen, contemporary Britain's 
most notorious serial killer -- is such a book. Faulting the true-crime genre 
for being "overwritten and often hysterical," literary biographer Brian Masters 
suggests that this book will be worthwhile only to the extent that it "opens a 
window upon human behavior. . . . Otherwise, one is left with little more than 
a prurient titillating of the imagination."  
</P>
<P>
 Masters' aim -- to show us "something of the nature of madness" -- is indeed 
true. He wields all sorts of impressive psychological tools to understand why 
Nilsen felt compelled to kill 15 young men between 1979 and 1983. But as 
British psychiatrist Anthony Storr concedes in a postscript to these pages, 
even such swanky terms as "Borderline False Self as if Pseudo Normal 
Narcissistic Personality Disorder" ultimately fail to make sense of Nilsen.  
</P>
<P>
 Thus, we are sometimes left with what is indeed a "prurient titillating of the 
imagination." Take, for example, the perverse but undeniably fascinating story 
of Nilsen's behavior at a 1979 Christmas party he organized for his office, the 
Kentish Town Jobcentre.  
</P>
<P>
 A respected executive officer, Nilsen cooked and catered for 80 people, in 
galley pots he learned to use as a British army cook, then socialized merrily 
with colleagues. But when one of them put on a classic rock song that Nilsen 
had associated intimately with his lover, Nilsen cascaded into depression and 
felt compelled to leave.  
</P>
<P>
 Returning to his apartment, Nilsen shouted to his lover, "Right, if you want 
to listen to the music, then damn well come out and listen to it." Removing the 
floorboards of his apartment, he pulled out his lover, whom he had killed two 
weeks earlier, and sat the body on a dining chair. Nilsen stood naked next to 
the body and trembled for many hours. 
</P>
<P>
 What Nilsen did with the other 14 men would put Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal 
Lecter to shame. Suffice it to say that he boiled more than pub grub in those 
galley pots. 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest conclusion to draw from stories like Nilsen's is: "Watch out! The 
world's a scary place. It's good to keep up your guard because these days, you 
never know who will turn out to be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Masters' theories may be imperfect, they manage to show that 
Nilsen's behavior arose not from some mysterious demonic possession, but from a 
predictable alienation that peaked when Nilsen began visiting a series of seedy 
gay bars to assuage his loneliness.  
</P>
<P>
 Finding London's anonymous, fleeting gay scene to be no less isolating than 
the "fiercely cold" fishing village of his childhood, Nilsen, Masters writes, 
ultimately felt compelled to "kill for company, to have someone to talk to, 
someone to care for." 
</P>
<P>
 This is, of course, an explanation, not an excuse. The fact that other people 
tread paths similar to Nilsen's without reaching such Dantesque destinations 
leaves no doubt that Nilsen lacked something, whether it was willpower in his 
soul or neurotransmitters in his brain.  
</P>
<P>
 Nilsen was sentenced to life in prison. His trial, nevertheless, clearly 
exposed the primitive nature of the 1843 M'Naghten Rules that Western courts 
still use to determine mental derangement in such people. Because Nilsen knew 
that what he was doing was wrong, he was considered sane under those rules. 
After closely studying Nilsen's life, though, Masters concludes that no 
adjective could possibly be more inappropriate.  
</P>
<P>
 In questioning such wisdom, Masters ultimately succeeds in his aspiration to 
go beyond titillation.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; STREISAND STAGE RETURN A LUSTROUS VEGAS EVENT; HER 
PERFORMANCE IS LIKE A ONE-WOMAN BROADWAY SHOW, EMPLOYING AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MUSIC 
AND STORIES AT THE MGM GRAND. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a magical moment during Barbra Streisand's landmark concert here 
Saturday night when the noted perfectionist . . . goofed. 
</P>
<P>
 She got mixed up on the words to her own song, the 1976 hit "Evergreen." 
</P>
<P>
 It was dramatic because one reason Streisand avoided formal concerts for 22 
years was stage fright -- the inability to re-shoot or re-record the way you 
can in studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the miscue Saturday was projected on a huge closed-circuit video 
screen, even those in the most remote areas of the MGM Grand Hotel's 
13,000-seat Grand Garden arena could see the startled look on Streisand's face 
as she realized her error. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than freeze, she smiled sheepishly and joked, "And it's my own 
song." 
</P>
<P>
 She then resumed the song, singing with the confidence and grace that 
characterized the rest of the evening's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's opening show in the two-night stand, you could sense at times a 
nervousness and hesitation in Streisand's manner. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, she was radiant and relaxed, bolstered partly, she explained 
later, by the far more enthusiastic response from a star-studded crowd that 
included Michael Jackson, Steven Spielberg, Gregory Peck, Jay Leno and Mel 
Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight was the way I hoped it would be," Streisand said at her hotel suite 
reception after the show. "Everything felt right." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, she said, she still wasn't ready to commit to a tour. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the arguments against it, she said: two movies that she wants to make. 
On the other hand, she's clearly proud of this production and would like to see 
it become a television special. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was to tape the Friday and Saturday concerts, but she canceled that 
aspect last week because she felt the nine cameras required would interfere 
with audience sight lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor that no doubt will be on the side of at least a short tour will 
be the memories of these two nights. 
</P>
<P>
 No one walks away from a critical and commercial triumph this spectacular. 
Each concert grossed more than $6 million, thus twice doubling the previous 
record for a U.S. pop event. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than simply a "greatest hits" run-through, the production was scripted 
along the autobiographical lines of a one-woman Broadway show. 
</P>
<P>
 She employed music and stories to reflect on such matters as childhood dreams, 
relationships, family ties and social responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in many ways, the tale of a survivor -- reflecting both the 
independence that has long been a part of her public image as well as the 
insecurities of the private person. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why I am frightened," she sang in the opening number, performing 
on a set resembling an elegant trilevel tea room in a Colonial mansion and 
backed by a 64-piece orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 A customized version of the song "Everything's As If We Never Said Goodbye," 
from "Sunset Boulevard," served as a statement of reacquaintance to her fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The version conveyed her anxiety about performing live, yet acknowledged the 
thrill of again being in front of an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 She then took us back to the days of her Brooklyn childhood when she fell in 
love with movies and music. In an especially effective moment, she shared the 
fantasy of singing with Marlon Brando in "Guys and Dolls." 
</P>
<P>
 Through special effects, she even assumed Jean Simmons' role in a clip from 
the film that was shown on the video screen as she sang along on the song "I'll 
Know." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving on to the adult years and the search for love, she alternated songs -- 
from "What Is This Thing Called Love?" to "The Man That Got Away" -- with 
humorous, mock conversations about the affairs of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, she sang two of her biggest '70s hits, "The Way We Were" 
and "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" -- while wearing a striking white tux jacket 
over a floor-length skirt highlighted by a dramatic slit. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a suit, she said, patterned after the one she wore at an inauguration 
gala -- a suit that was attacked by a woman in a newspaper column as sending 
the message that even a strong, successful woman has to play the femme fatale 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Streisand mentioned the column a voice cried out from the audience, 
"Barbra, don't listen to that woman." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Mike Myers, of "Saturday Night Live" and "Wayne's World," in the guise 
of his wickedly funny alter ego, Linda Richman. 
</P>
<P>
 She's the Long Island housewife-turned cable-access talk-show hostess with a 
Streisand obsession. She describes Streisand's every physical feature as being 
"like buttah" and "something to die for." 
</P>
<P>
 Richman then joined Streisand onstage, injecting the show with a liberating 
sense of fun as Streisand delighted in mimicking Richman's exaggerated 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the closing segment, the singer-actress dedicated songs of youthful 
innocence -- including "Someday My Prince Will Come" -- to her goddaughter in 
the audience and a song of maternal love, "Not While I'm Around," to her son 
Jason, who was also on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The final moments were devoted to Streisand the activist. Rather than 
rhetoric, however, she simply expressed the social optimism she feels with a 
stirring rendition of "Happy Days Are Here Again." 
</P>
<P>
 The formal part of the show was so seamless -- from Marvin Hamlisch's rich, 
inventive musical direction and conducting to Marc Brickman's dramatic lighting 
-- that the encore seemed anti-climactic, especially the hotel jokes that 
offered little of the purposefulness of the rest of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Going back on the road, Streisand also needs to rethink the use of the 
TelePrompTers, which were visible to much of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fine to use them as security blankets while singing or delivering skits 
(even Mick Jagger does), but it breaks the intimacy of the show when she even 
has her expressions of appreciation flash on them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, it wasn't the TelePrompTers or hotel jokes that fans were 
talking about after the show. It was how Streisand combined in these two hours 
all that she has learned as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing upon her experience in movies and music, Streisand injected the 
production with a director's sense of atmosphere and occasion, an actress's 
feel for character and intimacy and a singer's vocal beauty and command.

 Loni and Burt Update: Actress Loni Anderson claims she is nearly broke and 
needs temporary alimony from her estranged husband Burt Reynolds to maintain 
her affluent lifestyle, Florida court documents show. Lawyers for the couple 
are scheduled to appear in state court in Jupiter, Fla., (where the two own a 
ranch) today for the first in a series of hearings in the divorce case. 
Anderson claims she entered the marriage in 1988 with $1 million. She says she 
earned about $1.7 million during the marriage, but spent all the money on 
marital living expenses and child care for the couple's adopted 5-year-old son. 
One of Reynolds' attorneys disputed the image of Anderson as impoverished: 
"This is just not a situation where she is destitute and requires payment," he 
said.

 On the Mend: Tony Danza faces more than a week in the hospital to recuperate 
from his skiing injuries. Danza was in stable condition at the University of 
Utah Health Sciences Center on New Year's Eve, one day after an operation to 
repair spinal damage. The star of "Who's the Boss?" is recovering from a back 
injury, broken ribs and internal injuries suffered in a skiing accident last 
week at Deer Valley ski resort outside of Salt Lake City. Dr. John D. Schlegel, 
who performed the surgery, said a rod had to be inserted in Danza's back where 
one vertebra was broken and slightly dislocated. He said Danza, 42, will need 
rehabilitative therapy.

 Network News Shuffle?: ABC News will reportedly announce this week that John 
Cochran, a 23-year veteran of NBC News, has been named Capitol Hill 
correspondent. Jackie Judd, who has been on the beat since February, will 
become a special assignment correspondent for "ABC World News Tonight." ABC 
News would not confirm the signing of Cochran late last week. Cochran 
reportedly is leaving NBC News on good terms. He is expected to start at ABC in 
late January, in time for the State of the Union address.

 A Cartoony Night: Edith Ann, that precocious child character created by Lily 
Tomlin, gets her own prime-time animated special on ABC Jan. 18 at 8:30 p.m. 
Tomlin supplies the voice for "Edith Ann -- A Few Pieces of the Puzzle," in 
which the girl visits her school psychologist after feeling unloved when her 
family seems to have forgotten her birthday. . . . The same night on NBC, 
Charlie Brown returns to TV with a new animated special, "You're in the Super 
Bowl, Charlie Brown!" The Peanuts gang's first show on NBC after nearly three 
decades on CBS finds Charlie Brown and Linus competing in NFL halftime 
field-goal kicking competitions for kids. But real life kids won't need to work 
the VCR to watch their animated counterparts -- Charlie Brown airs at 8 p.m., 
preceding Edith Ann, with each running a half-hour.

 Soap in Hot Water: Families of victims of the bombing of a Pan Am airliner 
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988 have accused the producers of a 
British soap opera of being "sick" for using a similar story to boost ratings. 
The first of four episodes of "Emmerdale" last week featured a plane 
disintegrating in the sky over the fictional village of Beckindale, killing 
four and injuring dozens. Executive producer Keith Richardson said the 
storyline was designed to attract a younger audience. But a man whose daughter 
was one of the 270 people killed in the bombing said the producers were 
ignoring the feelings of families still grieving.

COUNTERPUNCH: TWO MORE FILMS, A LOT MORE COINCIDENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Paula with his wife and six children.

 I enjoyed reading Marshall Fine's "Two Movie Families, 10 Coincidences" 
(Calendar, Nov. 21) in which he compared the strange similarities between two 
recent movie releases: "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "Addams Family Values." 
Although I must admit these movies share some common points, Fine missed the 
real target. He should have zeroed in on two other recent releases that are so 
much alike you'd think the only thing the screenwriters changed were the names. 
Consider instead "Dave" and "King Ralph." I counted more than 30 similarities, 
but here are the 18 best ones: 
</P>
<P>
 "DAVE" 
</P>
<P>
 * When the movie opens we meet Dave, a two-bit entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
 * As the result of an untimely fatality, Dave, a common man, masquerades as 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 * Close aides teach Dave how to be President. 
</P>
<P>
 * A conspiracy develops to plot Dave's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dave falls in love with the First Lady, a down-to-earth woman. 
</P>
<P>
 * The common sense of the common man endears Dave to leaders and citizens 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dave gets cabin fever and sneaks out of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dave's lack of presidential experience trips him up, causing public 
embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dave's nemesis is an important political figure who wants to be President. 
</P>
<P>
 * The relationship between Dave and the First Lady is good, then it's bad, 
then it's good again. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dave discovers the plot against him. 
</P>
<P>
 * A loyal aide helps Dave plot against the plotters. 
</P>
<P>
 * The movie's climax has Dave make an unusual appearance before a joint 
session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 * In his speech, Dave confesses his failings, exposes the plot against him, 
humiliates his antagonist and clears the name of his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bad guy is abandoned by his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 * The vice president, by law, becomes President. 
</P>
<P>
 * The movie attempts to give us a greater appreciation for what it means to be 
a President. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the end, Dave gets the girl, who has money. "KING RALPH" 
</P>
<P>
 * When the movie opens we meet Ralph, a two-bit entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
 * As the result of a number of untimely fatalities, Ralph, a commoner, becomes 
King. 
</P>
<P>
 * A close aide teaches Ralph how to be King. 
</P>
<P>
 * A conspiracy develops to plot Ralph's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ralph falls in love with a commoner, a down-to-earth woman. 
</P>
<P>
 * The common sense of the common man endears Ralph to leaders and citizens 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ralph gets cabin fever and sneaks out of the palace. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ralph's lack of royal experience trips him up, causing public embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ralph's nemesis is an important political figure who wants to be King. 
</P>
<P>
 * The relationship between Ralph and his girl is good, then it's bad, then 
it's good again. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ralph discovers the plot against him. 
</P>
<P>
 * A loyal aide helps Ralph plot against the plotters. 
</P>
<P>
 * The movie's climax has Ralph make an unusual appearance before Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 * In his speech, Ralph confesses his failings, exposes the plot against him, 
humiliates his antagonist and handpicks his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bad guy is abandoned by his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ralph's aide, by birthright, becomes King. 
</P>
<P>
 * The movie attempts to give us a greater appreciation for what it means to be 
a King. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the end, Ralph gets the girl and becomes a rich duke. Holy Movie Formula, 
Batman!

WEEKEND REVIEWS; TV; STERN SETS BACK NEW YEAR

 "How does it feel?" asked Howard Stern, making a grand entrance on his New 
Year's Eve pay-per-view special astride a rising toilet. "Forty bucks to watch 
me take a dump!" 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty crappy is how it felt, Howard, if you have to know. 
</P>
<P>
 But, amid all the false hope usually generated this time annually, Stern's 
astronomically profitable live broadcast from Newark, N.J., did at least 
provide hapless payees a cold slap of reality to start '94. What better way, 
really, to ring in the New Year than with a show that makes the case that human 
history has gone on perhaps just a year or two too long? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably never before have so many hundreds of thousands awakened Jan. 1 
bereft of hangovers but still bleating I feel dirty over and over like a boozy 
mantra. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Miss Howard Stern New Year's Eve Pageant" came in the quasi-parodic guise 
of a nearly pornographic beauty contest, winding up sort of a cross between 
Michael Ritchie's "Smile" and Penthouse magazine's humor section. Or was it a 
cross between "Stupid Human Tricks" and the Chicken Ranch? 
</P>
<P>
 Forty shameless young women competed for a $50,000 prize by baring breasts, 
indulging in not-so-hetero high jinks under Stern's constant cajoling and 
demonstrating bizarre "talents." Among the more printable nicknames: the 
Lesbian Ice Sculptress From Albany and Miss Chocolate Sundae. Among the more 
printable talents promised and delivered: "I love to cover myself with peanut 
butter and let strange men throw bread at me" and "I eat maggots." 
</P>
<P>
 The other freak show was in the celebrity jury box. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Janis Ian was the sole woman on the panel. (Guess why.) Rounding it out 
was a cast of blokes that looked glad to be anywhere, from singer Tiny Tim to 
black-baiting KKKer Daniel Carver to slightly clueless pugilist Joe Frazier. 
The honorary foreman was spousal-abuse poster boy John Wayne Bobbitt, who 
turned down Stern's cash offers to show off his scars and muffed all his lines 
in a way that suggested he'd lost more blood than anyone thought. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the broadcast was satirizing the generic, outdated conventions of beauty 
pageants, it was sometimes hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stern was taking the poop out of major celebrities -- starting with an 
absolutely witless Michael Jackson molestation skit, and improving with an 
amusing duet with Ian on "At Seventeen" viciously rewritten about Jerry 
Seinfeld and his teen-aged girlfriend, plus a Whoopi-'n'-Ted sketch with 
Sherman Hemsley -- he was at least excusable. Even if Stern assailing other 
stars' moral sense is like the pot calling the kettle kitchenware. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the focus was "up close and personal" on the pageant's 40 
contestants, the special veered between the occasionally funny "found" humor of 
real-life crazies and a pathos that rendered the whole enterprise finally about 
as much fun as "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman whose nickname compared her breasts to fried eggs appeared so drunk 
she might have fallen over. Another who claimed she's regularly seduced by 
space aliens seemed to be suffering strange facial seizures, as if possessed. 
And then there was the tape of the topless wanna-be being interviewed on 
Stern's radio show, cajoled into discussing her mother's shooting death, only 
to faint on the studio floor -- where, Stern compassionately added, she was 
lucky not to have been molested. 
</P>
<P>
 Sad sights to take into the new year, by almost any standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsaddened, Stern himself was amazed at the compliance when he suggested 
contestants grope each other for extra points: "Evidently this is an orgy," he 
marveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently that makes Stern a word that starts with a P, and it's not 
pay-per-view proprietor.

WEEKEND REVIEWS; POP; A STRANGE MIX AT THE FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nostalgia is certainly one way of dealing with New Year's Eve, so Duran Duran 
arrived at the Forum Friday night with an abundance of the stuff, launching the 
show with sets by Adam Ant and, gasp! , the '70s crotch-grabbing camp of the 
Village People. 
</P>
<P>
 This strange mixing of the decades was a fitting close to a year that saw the 
rebirth of '70s cool and kitsch in music and fashion.Duran Duran hasn't yet 
given up on the present, and is enjoying some renewed popularity with its 
recent "Duran Duran" album. But it was to the hyper-beat of 1981's "Girls on 
Film" that the band counted down the year's final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The band Rolling Stone once dubbed "the Fab Five" has never stretched 
creatively far beyond the handful of light but crafty pop singles of its '80s 
heyday. And if some of the non-hits performed at the Forum were shapeless, 
Duran Duran's best new material of smooth romantic rhythms at least showed the 
band ready to remake itself into a kind of Bryan Ferry act for teens. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the night's lineup was no less energetic in abbreviated sets. 
After a sluggish start, Adam Ant and his band (which included longtime 
guitarist Marco Pirroni) were most inspired during the edgy pop cult hits 
"Goody Two-Shoes" and "Antmusic." 
</P>
<P>
 And singing to a throbbing prerecorded R&B pulse, the Village People remain as 
they were when last heard at the end of the disco era: an oddly endearing 
"macho" glee club, straight out of goofball night at Chippendale's. They 
reminisced about Donny & Marie, "The Brady Bunch," 8-track tapes and "Charlie's 
Angels." It was nostalgia for things many in the young crowd probably hardly 
remembered or never knew at all. STEVE APPLEFORD

COUNTERPUNCH: GAY ROLES A 'RISK' TO ACTORS? NONSENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE WERBEL, Lee Werbel is executive director of Gay & Lesbian Alliance 
Against Defamation/Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The theme of two recent articles, regarding Tom Hanks starring in 
"Philadelphia" ("Deadly Serious," Calendar, Dec. 19) and Will Smith's role in 
"Six Degrees of Separation" ("Yo! Check Out the Fresh Prince's 180-Degree 
Turn," Calendar, Dec. 4), was that these two actors were making "great leaps" 
by playing gay characters in current releases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation/Los Angeles (GLAAD/LA) strongly 
supports the release of these two movies, especially "Philadelphia." We are 
very concerned, however, about the slant of the coverage surrounding the actors 
playing gay characters. 
</P>
<P>
 It's especially ironic that in covering the first major studio release dealing 
with AIDS-phobia and homophobia ("Philadelphia"), the interviewer's primary 
focus was on the presumed damage that starring in such a film might do to the 
actor's career. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting is a profession that usually involves playing someone with a 
personality and characteristics different than the actor's own. We are not 
aware of articles dealing with the "courage" of actors playing most other types 
of characters. So why, when an actor plays someone lesbian or gay, are we 
treated to a cover story heralding his/her "bravery"?  
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, these stories involve a full analysis of the risks involved in 
taking the role, why the actor or others had concerns about the role, and an 
explanation that he/she is not gay. 
</P>
<P>
 The subtitles for The Times story are problematic enough -- "How did Tom Hanks 
come to play a gay lawyer with AIDS?" "What made him take the leap?" But the 
article practices a subtle form of apparently unconscious defamation when it 
states that Hanks' "likability quotient will probably never again be put to 
(this) kind of test." 
</P>
<P>
 It is really not a big deal for a heterosexual actor to be playing a gay or 
lesbian role -- lesbian and gay actors play heterosexual roles all the time. We 
therefore find it offensive to see Will Smith's homophobic reactions to his 
role -- "scariest choice I've ever had to make in my career," "I was concerned 
about how my credibility would be affected" -- painted as"courageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Why was the chief focus of questioning Smith about the gay aspect of his 
character, rather than, say that he was playing a conartist or a liar? 
</P>
<P>
 Through stories and interviewers of this kind, The Times and other papers are 
creating and reinforcing the myth that playing a gay or lesbian character could 
have a negative impact on an actor's career. To the contrary, a long line of 
highly successful actors have played gay and lesbian characters at some point 
in their career. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is The Times making this the essential issue? 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily there are an increasing number of movies and television shows that 
reflect the diverse makeup of American society. Lesbians and gays are in every 
walk of life in every society. GLAAD/LA is working to ensure greater inclusion 
of lesbian and gay characters in film and on television. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times does a disservice to its readership when it reinforces the 
homophobic notions about the effect of playing gay and lesbian roles that we 
are working so hard to fight.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'BRISCO COUNTY' IS A FAMILY-ORIENTED SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLTON CUSE, Carlton Cuse is executive producer of The Adventures of Brisco 
County Jr., produced by Warner Bros. Television. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In regard to the article "Fox Tops Tally of Violence on Major TV Networks" 
(Part A, Dec. 18), it was incorrect for your headline to say that Sen. Byron L. 
Dorgan's "study . . . lists 'Brisco County' as bloodiest series." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the press release from the Democratic senator from North Dakota made 
no mention of blood, and, in the 20 hours of "Brisco County" produced so far, 
blood has appeared only once, in one scene, in one episode. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the senator's study seems terribly misleading. It appears his 
researchers simply tallied the number of so-called "violent acts" (not clearly 
defined in either the senator's press release or your article) in each show, 
then totaled them, without any regard for the context in which they occurred. 
For instance, during the survey week, our "Brisco" episode featured a boxing 
match. The senator's researchers must have counted every last punch, jab and 
parry for us to supersede "Beverly Hills Cop" and appear at the top of his 
survey list. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have viewed the action in "Brisco County" in the context of the 
overall program -- a tongue-in-cheek, comedic, action Western -- include "TV 
Guide," which ranked the show right behind "Roseanne" in their fall survey of 
the best family shows on television. "Family Life" magazine put us at the top 
of its list of quality programs on network television for children. 
</P>
<P>
 As a writer and producer, I take great pride in "Brisco County" and am very 
concerned about its content. My wife is a teacher, and I am a father of two. I 
carefully evaluate each and every scene within the framework of my own moral 
standards. Simply put, those standards do not allow material in the show that 
is not suitable for my 4-year-old son to view.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, I, along with all the writers, work hard at creating a strong 
moral context for the action that does occur in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 I read all the viewer letters sent in to the show, the studio, the network and 
even the Fox affiliates. The overwhelming majority praise "Brisco County" for 
being a show that the entire family can watch together. 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 original airings, I have not received one single letter criticizing 
the show on the grounds of violence or violent content.

JAZZ REVIEW; TITO PUENTE KEEPS ANAHEIM CELEBRATION GOING WELL INTO THE NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though it was the day after, it seemed that the year-end celebrations of the 
night before had never ended. New Year's Day at the Anaheim Marriott hotel 
found a quartet of Latin bands, including one led by timbale master Tito 
Puente, playing to a pair of packed dance floors during a rhythm-rich evening 
of salsa, mambo and cha-cha sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit the insatiable beats for keeping most of the estimated crowd of 2,000 
up and moving to the music. Layers of finely hammered percussion inspired 
dancing that ranged from a simple sway to involved steps executed by couples 
dressed in grand style. The gown color of choice, after black of course, was 
holiday red, and the reflected light from sequined dresses at times turned the 
dance floor into a twinkling, star-filled sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, much of the crowd took time off from their dancing during 
Puente's set to watch as the ageless percussionist led his ensemble, including 
an eight-piece brass section, through rhythmic exercises and jazz-inspired 
improvisational sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Puente himself was in fine form, rattling away at his timbales, all the while 
directing the crowd in vocal phrases or executing his trademark overhead 
flourishes with a drumstick. When a dead vocal mike had his singer apparently 
mouthing the words with nothing coming out, he brought the band to a halt and 
cracked, "It's Milli Vanilli." 
</P>
<P>
 Puente's 55-minute set closely followed his recent concert appearances in the 
Southland. The band opened with the salsa-fired theme "El Rey," the moniker by 
which the bandleader has been known since the '50s. Puente made it clear from 
the start that he was there to play, executing snare-like rolls on his 
timbales, then thickening the mix with cowbell accents and cymbal shimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the ensemble moved into an up-tempo version of his best-known 
number made popular by Carlos Santana, "Oye Como Va," the familiar rhythms 
colored by flute embellishment and deep harmonic backing from the trombones. 
Puente broke from the song to incite the crowd, in English, with a repeated 
"Can you feel it?" before striking back into the tune.  
</P>
<P>
 He followed with the Grammy-nominated love theme he wrote for the film "The 
Mambo Kings," and the romantic ballad drew a host of closely wrapped couples to 
the dance floor. Then he quickened the pace with a lively cha-cha dedicated to 
the late concert promoter and cha-cha aficionado Bill Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 The band closed with an intense salsa that was filled with kinky dissonance 
from the keyboard and assertive brass fanfares. The heated call-and-response 
exchanges between the trumpeters and trombonist Sam Brutis provided the 
evening's most inspired moments. With that, Puente suddenly left the stage, 
which brought a few complaints from the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the 10-piece Los Castenos Band of Honduras established the sensual 
mood with a long set of salsa and ballads. Featuring two untiring dancers 
dressed in creamy white skirts and pullovers gyrating in barely choreographed 
fashion next to a trio of vocalists, the group presented a strongly sexual, 
though never vulgar, set that kept the dance floor and beyond crowded with 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Up next, singer and conga-player Johnny Ray, backed by a trio of red-jacketed 
vocalists, extended the mood with passionate vocal exchanges and tightly hewn 
ensemble play.  
</P>
<P>
 Ray's set was given a rich, harmonic depth through smart orchestration that 
revolved on deeply voiced trombone flourishes. The strength and punch of Ray's 
ensemble was the perfect lead-in for Puente's short, high-energy set.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'CHINESE CINEMA' FOCUSES ON FIFTH-GENERATION ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UCLA Film Archive's "New Chinese Cinema," which runs Thursday through Feb. 
26 at the Melnitz Theater, focuses on the work of the so-called Fifth 
Generation filmmakers, those who were the first to attend the Beijing Film 
Academy since its reopening in 1978 in the wake of the Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been more critical and outspoken about the past as well as the 
present than their predecessors, which has brought them chronic censorship 
problems, but two of their number have become internationally acclaimed, Zhang 
Yimou ("Red Sorghum," "Raise the Red Lantern" and "The Story of Qiu Ju") and 
Chen Kaige ("Yellow Sky," "Farewell My Concubine"). 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the series Thursday at 7:30 p.m. is Tian Zhuangzhuang's "Horse Thief" 
(1986), one of the most fiercely demanding and awesomely beautiful films you 
are ever likely to see. It takes us into Tibet in the '20s -- it might as well 
be antiquity -- and presents us with a young clansman, Norbu (Tseshang Rigzin, 
who brings to mind the Toshiro Mifune of "Rashomon"), so poor he steals horses 
from transients to support his wife and 5-year-old son, yet so pious he gives 
most of his profits to the temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Tian follows Norbu's destiny with minimal dialogue and exposition, and with 
astounding images of natural beauty and of the elaborate, mysterious rituals of 
Tibetan Buddhism. As film historian Tony Rayns has observed, Tian invites us to 
meditate upon rather than to analyze what we're seeing, and Tian's images are 
indeed comparable to those of Andrei Tarkovsky, Sergei Paradjanov and Robert 
Bresson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Horse Thief" will be followed by Tian's "On the Hunting Ground" (1985). Once 
past its opening sequence, the film becomes an austere, ritualistic Miklos 
Jancso-like depiction of life on the Mongolian grasslands, where daily conduct 
is still ruled by precepts set down by Genghis Khan. But be warned: The film's 
first 12 minutes are given over to the shooting of sheep and deer, whose death 
throes are shown in protracted close-up. It has been said that the filmmaker 
wished to contrast the violence of the hunt with the comparative tranquillity 
of the Mongolian existence, but to what purpose is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine "Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice" set down amid Chinese peasantry, and you'd 
have a rough idea of what Yan Xueshu's delightful and provocative 1985 "In the 
Wild Mountains" (Saturday at 7:30 p.m.) is like. A rambunctious yet thoughtful 
comedy, it tells of two unhappy couples.  
</P>
<P>
 The burly, uncouth Huihui (Xin Ming) laments that his vivacious, independent 
wife Guilan (Yue Hong) is barren; meanwhile, Huihui's slender, feckless brother 
Hehe (Du Yuan) has more or less abandoned his deceptively demure-looking wife 
Qiurong (Xu Shouli) and their baby. Huihui and his sister-in-law take a 
traditional view of marriage while Guilan is determinedly liberated and more 
than willing to take a chance in supporting her brother-in-law in a 
money-making venture (which in its modest way smacks of free enterprise). 
</P>
<P>
 As this very lively and likable quartet sort out their lives, the film takes 
on an increasingly broader perspective in which we witness the growing impact 
of the modern world in bringing a breath of fresh, liberating air to a farming 
village still pursuing a way of life so ancient that its homes have neither 
electricity nor even glass (a Chinese invention, after all) for windowpanes.  
</P>
<P>
 Playing with "In the Wild Mountains," which took China's Oscar, the Golden 
Rooster for 1986, is Peng Ziolian's equally engaging, complementary "The Story 
of Country Women" (1988) -- and the only one of these four films not to have 
been shown at UCLA previously. Warm and earthy, it takes an affirmative view of 
three peasant women, two of them young, the other a wife and mother, who for 
the first time in their lives leave their mountain village in Northern China to 
journey to the big city to sell their yarn. 
</P>
<P>
 One minute they're descending the Great Wall and the next, they're boarding a 
bus in a breathtaking leap from antiquity to the modern world, where they learn 
how to survive and even prevail (also by engaging in free enterprise).  
</P>
<P>
 "The Story of Country Women" reiterates that no matter what the setbacks of 
city life may be, life is always worse for women in the countryside. Peng 
reveals just how difficult it is for Chinese women to overthrow the ancient 
notion that they are inferior to men.

'CHALLENGE' LOOKS AT WHAT'S WORKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Occasionally during his 4 1/2-hour report on the state of the nation, Hedrick 
Smith's "Challenge to America" sounds as if it is making a clarion call that 
has never been heard before. The message, in a sentence: If the U.S. is to stay 
afloat in the stormy waters of global business competition, the nation must 
rethink its approach to education, training workers, business and government 
relations and the free market itself. Anything less, Smith asserts, spells 
economic and social disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-part, two-evening report begins tonight (9-11 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 
28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15 and 8-10 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24) and concludes 
Tuesday (9-11:30 p.m. on KCET and KPBS and 8-10:30 p.m. on KVCR). 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem with this is that the themes of long-term planning, teamwork 
models and public-private sector cooperation are old news, even on television. 
The late guru of teamwork and corporate restructuring, W. Edwards Deming, 
sounded forth on the airwaves on just these topics (though Smith never mentions 
his name). Bill Clinton, whom Smith interviews in the concluding 30-minute 
segment, has a secretary of labor, Robert Reich, who made the similar-themed 
"Made in America?" for PBS in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 What is new here is Smith's explicit linking of successful models in Germany 
and Japan with new American approaches in education, job training and 
high-technology research. The recent Tokyo stock market collapse and grinding 
recessions in both of Smith's model foreign countries -- along with equally 
recent sales successes in the U.S. auto industry -- might seem to undercut the 
report's entire point. But as Clinton himself notes, such up-and-down economic 
blips shouldn't hide long-term structural problems in the American economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Germany and Japan may be better able to cope with their downturns, 
given the structures each country has in place. In the first and second parts 
("Old Ways, New Game" and "The Heart of the Nation"), Japan's Sharp Corp. is 
shown outstripping giant RCA in the revolutionary liquid crystal business, 
while Japanese and German students appear infinitely more prepared for work 
than their American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 In part three ("The Culture of Commerce"), it's clear that classroom habits 
have carried over to the German and Japanese corporate boardrooms -- but with 
big differences. While Japan provides a corporate "family" of mutual 
management-worker loyalties, Germany defuses conflicts by bringing labor into 
the boss' office, with real voting power. But can any of this translate into 
American culture? 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is warily optimistic, showing in the final part ("Winning Strategies") 
how Motorola remade its organization and is competing with Japanese products in 
Japan, and how Ford Motor Co. instilled German-like forms of worker 
involvement. Even more cheering are the looks at New York's Central Park East 
Secondary School -- using rigorous academic standards and training to produce 
college-bound inner-city students -- and Wisconsin's statewide apprentice 
program, which rescues mediocre students from hamburger-flipping and trains 
them for skilled, high-wage work. ROBERT KOEHLER

TV REVIEWS; 'GOOD LIFE' TRIES TO SELL SITCOM FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So inbred is the sitcom field that familiarity is the fuel that now drives 
most of these half-hour series, and you'd swear that moldiness is a 
prerequisite for getting many of them on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Good Life" doesn't fall quite into that category. Nor, however, does this 
new NBC comedy series (on Channels 4, 36 and 39) even approach freshness. 
Instead, the first two episodes, at 8:30 tonight and 8:30 Tuesday (the show's 
regular time period) try to sell viewers yet another of those forgettable 
sitcom families that enter and exit prime time by revolving door. This one 
comes from Jeff Martin, whose credits include "Late Night With David Letterman" 
and "The Simpsons," and Kevin Curran, whose pedigree includes both the 
Letterman show and "Married . . . With Children." Obviously, they've had better 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Living the "good life" here is John Bowman (John Caponera), who works in an 
office at a security products warehouse that he shares with his bachelor 
friend, Drew (Drew Carey). Tommy the dim dock foreman (Monty Hoffman) drops by 
too. On the home front, John's wife, Maureen (Eve Gordon), stages bad community 
theater at a church. Their younger son, Bob (Justin Berfield), chirps cutespeak 
. Their 12-year-old daughter, Melissa (Shay Astar), spews cynicspeak . And 
their earnest 15-year-old son, Paul (Jake Patellis), tonight announces he's 
following the lead of his new girlfriend and converting to Buddhism. The very 
mention of this at once rattles his parents and produces some pretty wretched 
Buddha jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 For much funnier sitcom accounts of parents coming of age along with their 
kids, try ABC's "Roseanne" and HBO's "Dream On." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime time's latest transferee from stand-up comedy, Caponera is likable 
enough as a hard-working, not-too-bright lug who at times resembles a lower 
case Al Bundy. And Gordon's Maureen is nice enough too. It's just that none of 
this -- not even attempts to do some creative things with Drew during the 
ending credits -- is very funny. And Tuesday's episode, in which Maureen shocks 
everyone by staging a nudie play titled "Cycle of Womanhood," is worse. HOWARD

TV REVIEWS; KCAL REPORTS ON 'EMERGING MAJORITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The peppy, upbeat reporting in "The Emerging Majority: Mexican Americans in 
Los Angeles" (9 p.m. tonight, KCAL-TV Channel 11; repeats 2 p.m., Sunday ; SAP 
channel for Spanish-language version) reflects a developing optimism about 
Latinos here. You can see it on the city's commercial streets, especially 
Broadway on weekends. You can hear it on the radio with KLAX-FM's banda sounds 
thrashing the competition. You can count it in city, county, state and 
congressional seats, filled with more and more Latino representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 And the numbers host Sylvia Lopez serves up look good for this community. 
Latino business growth has shot up 80% in five years in L.A. County, where 
one-third of all businesses are Latino-owned. Even more impressive, 800,000 
Latinos are now able to apply for U.S. citizenship through the end of 1994, 
thanks to immigration amnesty laws -- and new citizens tend to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 That Latino residents now tend not to vote in proportion to their numbers is 
only one of the nettlesome problems given a glance here. (Illegal immigration, 
of course, is another.) But the glance is fleeting, and the program's cultural 
framework is part of the problem. The word Chicano is uttered (by the Times' 
George Ramos) only once during the hour -- odd, in a program so intent on 
promoting the pride and progress of people with Mexican roots. The very debate 
over whether to identify oneself as "Chicano," "Latino," "Mexican American" or 
"Hispanic" is emblematic of the kinds of internal arguments that never surface 
here, as if it would mar the program's peppiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Even odder, the cultural progress noted in "Emerging Majority" -- Culture 
Clash on TV, spurts of interest in Chicano painting, the banda explosion -- 
fails to include theater, where artists from Luis Valdez to Lisa Loomer have 
put a dynamic accent on a traditionally Anglo-dominated art form. ROBERT

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
WESTMINSTER: PACIFIC RIM APPROACH EARNS SCHOOL TOP HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Compiled by PATRICIA A. KONLEY /For The Times

<P>
 Cash-strapped schools in California face an formidable challenge: provide an 
increasingly diverse student population with an education to help youths 
compete globally. In Orange County, Westminster High School's efforts to meet 
this goal were recognized by the U.S. Department of Education last October, 
when the school received a National Exemplary School award. Only 260 secondary 
schools nationwide receive the award, which is given every other year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Westminster was one of only three high schools in the country to 
receive a special commendation for its science program. Rather than study a 
single discipline for the entire term, students learn how a combination of 
sciences apply to routine activities such as cooking. This "small dose" 
approach makes it easier to master complex principles and gets students -- 
especially minorities -- to take additional science classes, school officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The honors follow a restructuring that began in 1990 to better serve the 
school's 2,350 students, more than one-third of whom have limited proficiency 
in English and come from families on Aid to Families with Dependent Children. 
After meeting with parents, business leaders, staff and students, school 
officials set up a program they call the Pacific Rim Academy. "The program 
allowed us to promote those strengths our students inherently have because of 
their cultural backgrounds and language and apply them toward an international 
trade market centered around the Pacific Rim in the 21st Century," says 
Principal Bonnie Maspero. It blends traditional academics with a vocational 
approach to ensure that graduates are technologically literate and have salable 
job skills and a head start on advanced degrees. WHAT THEY DO THAT'S DIFFERENT 
</P>
<P>
 Among factors cited by the Department of Education were:  
</P>
<P>
 Block scheduling: This provides longer classes fewer times a week, similar to 
college schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutorial sessions: These 30-minute sessions are built into the schedule four 
days a week to let students and teacher have more time together. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflict mediation: Each semester, 25 students are trained to use nonviolent 
methods approved by U.S. Department of Justice and Orange County Mediation 
Center to resolve peer disputes. A WORKPLACE APPROACH 
</P>
<P>
 As freshmen, students spend four weeks studying six career paths. Six 
instructors team-teach the course, which lets students identify interests with 
aptitude and attitude tests. Upperclassmen participate in paid and non-paid 
internships, one-on-one mentoring with business professionals and course work 
at nearby community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Career paths are: 
</P>
<P>
 Arts and communication 
</P>
<P>
 Home, health and hospitality  
</P>
<P>
 Human, government and social services 
</P>
<P>

THEY MEASURE SUCCESS 
</P>
<P>
 Since adopting the Pacific Rim approach, school officials say: 
</P>
<P>
 The dropout rate fell from 11% to 3.1% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of students who take a third year of science above district 
requirements has jumped 400% since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 teams of educators from throughout the state and nation visited 
the campus last year. A STUDENT'S PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
<P>
 KRISSY HEATH 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore, 15 
</P>
<P>
 I plan to go to college and major in law. I thought I knew how much I'd have 
to study before, but the career courses made me research how many years of 
school I really have to take. 
</P>
<P>
 I like block scheduling. It gives you more time to understand the teacher and 
subject so you don't get so cluttered. And the tutorial is good because if 
you're absent, you don't have to waste class time to find out what makeup work 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The best part of school is the different cultures. You're not just stuck with 
one. I like seeing their dances and foods. It's easy to make friends; I have a 
variety. AN OBSERVER'S VIEW

 Westminster is a very special school due to their location and the makeup of 
their students, who are roughly one-third Hispanic, one-third Anglo and 
one-third Vietnamese. (Educators there) believe that if they can't succeed, 
California is doomed. Their purpose is not just in the academic sense of 
raising SAT scores; it's in the toleration of cultures.  
</P>
<P>
 Their science program is very progressive. It is the only school in the 
district with a farm. Teacher Norm Nakanishi solicited research connections 
with not only major universities but with enterprises. The administration has 
allowed this staff to be innovative to solve their own problems within their 
community rather than whining about Proposition 13 and cuts.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders stunned Washington early last month, when she 
said making drugs legal could "markedly reduce our crime rate" and called for 
more studies of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clinton Administration was quick to distance itself from her 
remarks, some conservatives and liberals believe the the war on drugs has 
failed and that it's time to look at other options, including legalization and 
decriminalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the war on drugs claim that our jails and prisons are so 
overcrowded with drug dealers and abusers that hardened criminals are going 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Platform, the debate continues, with some agreeing with Elders and 
others vehemently opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have consistently shown that the majority of Americans opposes 
legalizing drugs and people like Father Matthew DeMaria, who works closely with 
drug offenders, believes doing so would be counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Matthew, pastoral minister at Covenant House, a Hollywood-based shelter 
for runaway youths under 21, says, "Our attempt here at Covenant House is to 
try to get the kids off the street and to help them with their drug problem so 
that they can lead productive lives again." 
</P>
<P>
 When kids run away from home, they don't always know what they are getting 
into, says Father Matthew. "When they see the horrors of the street, one of the 
first things someone introduces them to is drugs and they start using to escape 
from the sad reality that they now have to live on the street. I see a lot of 
misery because of the drug trafficking that goes on here in Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Ali, executive director of Covenant House, adds, "We're really in the 
business, to a great extent, of trying to expose these kids to values other 
than the kind that they find out on the street, so that they can make some 
healthy choices down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 If the country legalizes illicit drugs, Ali asks, what kind of message will we 
be sending young people? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid that many people will read that message as one that actually 
condones the use of drugs in this society, that we've given up on trying to 
fight against drug use and drug abuse in this country. I've got concerns that 
it would make my job and the job of anyone who is working with at-risk 
individuals -- who are, in many ways, using drugs as a way to self-medicate, as 
a way to deal with their problems in terms of hopelessness and despair -- that 
it's just going to make this job a lot more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Ali says that well over 50% of the kids who come to Covenant House say they 
have problems with substance abuse. And it is a problem that is increasing, not 
decreasing, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last three months, within our program staff at Covenant House, we've 
been looking for ways to increase the services that we offer kids in the area 
of substance-abuse treatment and prevention. We already do a fair amount in 
that area but we're seeing the need to do more." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, alternatives to the current war on drugs need to be studied. But 
legalization may not be the answer.

 Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders has said that legalizing drugs could "markedly 
reduce our crime rate," and has called for further study of the radical idea. 
Voices asked some Southern Californians what they think of the proposal. DOUG

<P>
 I do think that the surgeon general is right in that we need to look at other 
ideas in dealing with the drug problem in this country. If you look at other 
countries, there does seem to be a correlation between the legalization of 
drugs and the drop in crime. However, whether a policy of legalization leads to 
this is still not clear. It's too early to begin legalization. There are many 
questions and concerns that must be addressed before we can start legalization. 
CARLOS MANALO 
</P>
<P>
 Community worker, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 The surgeon general is correct in saying that we must look into other ways to 
halt the spread of drugs. As far as legalization, I think it's time to 
seriously look at the possibility of this. If the government could control the 
distribution like in England or Holland, then I think this would be a big step 
in eradicating the drugs from the street. From there, however, we must begin a 
comprehensive education program that would teach youngsters about the dangers 
of drugs. Like cigarettes, which are legal, we are finding that education is 
working. Children understand that smoking is bad for them. The same can be done 
with (illegal) drugs. DOUG LONGSHORE

 I don't think legalizing drugs will make any difference in the crime rate on 
our streets. People are desperate. People are homeless. They don't have jobs. 
Children are not being educated. They feel they have no future. Drugs are an 
escape for many of these people. Drugs are a problem, but we have to look at 
what leads to the use of them. We have to start dealing with society's ills. 
Legalization of drugs would be just another Band-Aid approach. CELIA CARRERA 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In my case, drugs ruined my life. But I know that booze has ruined a lot of 
other peoples' lives. One is legal, one isn't. I don't think legalizing drugs 
will make that big a difference. I think education and rehabilitation are more 
important than legalization. I would have taken drugs whether they were legal 
or not. The important thing is to get that person to not try it. If people are 
afraid to try it, the demand will naturally dry up. CHRIS BROWN 
</P>
<P>
 Associate professor of criminal justice and sociology, Chapman University, 
Orange 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious that our U.S. current drug policy is not working. And I think it 
is time to at least look at other ways to control the drug problem. I 
personally think that drugs should be legalized because once you take the 
economic factor out of drugs, then crime associated with it would decrease. If 
you look at other countries like Holland or England, where the government 
controls the dispensation of some drugs, violence associated with drugs has 
dropped. But aside from that, we must look at other ways to stop the drug 
problem in this country. STEVE TAYLOR 
</P>
<P>
 Senior vice president, Phoenix House, Gardena 
</P>
<P>
 I think that the surgeon general's comment signifies something that is very 
disturbing. For her to make such a statement -- which I think is a correct 
statement -- comes out of frustration. There is no cohesive drug policy in this 
country. While the issue of drug legalization makes for good mental debate, I 
think the primary problem at hand is what are we going to do with those 
currently addicted to drugs? The caseload of those strung out on drugs is out 
of hand. We must have a policy that will take care of these people and, if we 
can rehabilitate them, do so. Until we address this problem first, a policy of 
drug legalization would be pointless. PAUL M. WALTERS 
</P>
<P>
 Chief of police, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 I think the legalization of drugs would be the worst thing we could ever do. 
What would change if we legalized them? The same people who abuse them would 
keep abusing them, and nothing would change in their lives. They wouldn't be 
contributing anything positive to society. And if they sold drugs, they would 
look for another way of illegally making money. And what about those who are 
law-abiding citizens who don't take drugs because they are illegal? Then we 
would be opening a door for those people to legally take drugs. Like alcohol, 
which is legal, I think we would have another drug to abuse. The ramifications 
of legalizing drugs are far too dangerous.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH / OPINION; THE 
KEY IS 'TO MEET CHALLENGES HEAD ON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYUNG JUN OH, Myung Jun Oh, 17, attends the Elite Educational Institute, a 
private school in Buena Park.

<TEXT>
<P>
 How do people meet challenges and what can be learned from them? The answer 
depends, to a large degree, on one's attitude. By far the greatest challenge of 
my life has been adapting to American society, an experience that has not only 
dramatically changed my attitude but noticeably improved my character as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, I came to the United States from Korea. Because Korea and the U.S. 
differ so immensely, it is impossible to describe all of the nuances and 
peculiarities that distinguish the two nations. To me, America seemed strange, 
chaotic and overwhelming. I had a difficult time adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, language was my biggest problem. In Korea, I had studied English 
grammar, sentence structure, composition and vocabulary. I therefore didn't 
anticipate that language would be a handicap, but it was. While four years of 
schooling enabled me to critically read Ernest Hemingway's "Old Man and the 
Sea," I was in no way prepared to discern the deluge of idioms, slang and 
accents so habitually used in everyday conversation. Americans have customized 
their speech so much that the dialect's variances with standard English are 
confounding. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, I couldn't fully interact in my new surroundings, so I felt 
disabled -- like a writer who had lost his drafting hand. I made few new 
friends and became increasingly isolated. I never thought coming to America 
would be so disappointing. I eventually came to regret having moved to America 
and blamed my parents for my unwarranted suffering. But faulting others in no 
way made my situation less grievous or more tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, I explained my predicament to a friend who had migrated here from 
Korea about four years earlier. He advised me to change my attitude and to 
think positively. He said that I could learn the most from my painful 
experiences. Instead of recoiling from my tribulations, he recommended that I 
meet these challenges head on. 
</P>
<P>
 I skeptically accepted his advice and started listening very carefully to 
television, in order to understand the idiomatic content of the language used 
in conversations. I then practiced speaking with Americans to improve my 
articulation. Although this process was tedious and frustrating at times, it 
did eventually prove to be rewarding. I overcame many of the past hardships. I 
began to enjoy life a lot more. Communication helped me replace my groundless 
animosities with an appreciation for social cultures. I'm now even considering 
social science as an academic college major. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be no academic way to measure what I learned from this experience. 
Nevertheless, I am confident that no matter what challenges await my future, 
the lessons learned from my first few months in America will remain guiding 
principles for the rest of my life.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GIVING BACK; 'I 
COULD RESPOND FULLY WHEN I FELT FULLY READY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT V. BIROSCHAK, Father Robert V. Biroschak is associate pastor at Our 
Lady of the Assumption Church in Ventura. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In June, 1967, I came to Los Angeles and began a new life. I came to practice 
corporate securities law in a downtown firm, live on the Westside and enjoy the 
good life. In August, 1989, I left that life to study for the Catholic 
priesthood. This past June, 26 years after I arrived in Los Angeles, I was 
ordained a Catholic priest.  
</P>
<P>
 Why a priest? Why now? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to the first question is easier than the answer to the second. I 
think I knew from my earliest years that I was meant to be a priest. From my 
childhood, I was deeply influenced by the church's sacramental life and I 
wanted to be one who would bring that life -- God's love in action -- to 
others. Why then did I wait until I was 50 years old to start my preparation? I 
suppose there were many reasons, some of which I am probably not fully aware 
of. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps I am merely a reflection of an increasing phenomenon: More than 
one-third of my ordination class are second-career people, although by no means 
were they as old as I when they began studying. But that's not the whole 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The core of the matter has to do with who was doing the deciding. In the 
Catholic view of things, one does not choose to be a priest. One is chosen for 
it by God. I understand the meaning of those words intellectually. Nonetheless 
I had -- and have -- a hard time grappling with them emotionally. No balanced 
person can believe that they are really worthy of God's choice. Perhaps that's 
why my decision took long to mature. But when all is said and done, the best 
answer is that I could respond fully only when I felt fully ready. 
</P>
<P>
 There were hints during my legal career that I would finally say yes to that 
nagging, never-going-away attraction to a priestly vocation. I was technically 
proficient in my chosen specialty, but what I enjoyed most about my practice 
was my relationship with my clients. I enjoyed helping them reach their goals. 
I became personally close to a number of them: I attended their children's 
weddings and saw one client through a significant illness, then comforted his 
widow. 
</P>
<P>
 A good number of people must have read the clues. When I announced my decision 
to study for the priesthood, virtually all of my family, and many of my 
friends, showed no surprise. They said they felt that "the other shoe had 
finally dropped." It wasn't dissatisfaction with my career that prompted my 
decision. And I can honestly say that I don't yearn for the creature comforts 
that were part and parcel of my former lifestyle. In fact, I feel freer now, 
more focused. If I have any regrets, they are only the increased geographical 
distance between me and old friends and the decreased time available to spend 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
 What ultimately drew me to the priesthood was a desire to be of service to 
people and to be present with them -- to bring God's love to them -- at the 
most critical moments of their lives: moments of love, when they discover that 
they are in love and wish to be married; moments of pride and elation, when 
they see their children baptized; moments of trial, when they learn they are 
seriously ill; moments of desolation, when a marriage is irretrievably broken, 
and moments of grief and bafflement, when one who is dearly loved is taken by 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after I began my ministry that I could experience how deeply 
moving and fulfilling those moments would be. In the six months since I have 
been ordained, I have baptized scores of infants, seen the delight on their 
parents' faces, felt some of the joy that they felt in knowing their children 
were entering their own cherished faith. I have officiated at weddings and 
experienced the joy of happy couples beginning a new life together. 
</P>
<P>
 I have also witnessed death quite often, and very close up. I have helped 
console a young widow and her college-age son on the loss of their husband and 
father from a lengthy, painful and draining illness. I spent much of Labor Day 
with a bewildered young couple as they faced, for the third time, the death of 
a child. I was present as they made the difficult decision about how long 
heroic measures should be employed to save a perfectly formed, beautiful baby 
girl whose lungs would not function. I watched their little daughter die in the 
presence of her father and grandparents, saw her lifeless body being tenderly 
held by her dad, then taken to her mother, confined in a nearby hospital, for 
what was to be both a first embrace and a final farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 These privileged, intimate moments have been among the most fulfilling of my 
life. Had I decided that I was too old to be a priest or that it was too late 
to start over, I know that I would have been much the less for it. And so I 
often wonder how many others, already successful in a career or occupation, 
might also feel that persistent tug to give more of themselves to a bigger 
enterprise.

By Bob Modica, 49, is president of Local 582 of the Plumbers & Steamfitters 
Union in Santa Ana. He moved to Southern California from Wilkes-Barre, Pa.; As 
Told to ROBERT SCHEER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The economy in the state of California is the worst I've seen in the 30 years 
that I have been here. I've been involved in the union movement for those 30 
years and this is the worst it's been. Our membership in Orange County has 
dropped from 1,500 to 800. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, the labor movement is about 16-17% of the work force; it used to 
be 24%. There's a lot of people who say they are not in a union, but they are 
-- they don't realize it. My son's a deputy sheriff and he belongs to an 
association. They don't call it a union, but it's the same thing. The teachers 
have the same thing. I think the union movement will come back. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody thinks of Orange County doing so well. In our local we're about a 
third unemployed -- electricians, brick masons the same way. Used to be that 
about 80% of all the houses that were being built were done union. Now it's 
just the opposite -- about 90% are built non-union. There's about two housing 
contractors left who are union compared to about 40 some 15 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 (Contractors) are paying less money, but they're not getting qualified 
workers. Hell, we go to school two days a week. We have to keep up with the 
technology. I'm not the type of plumber who goes house to house fixing people's 
leaky faucets. We have a five-year apprenticeship program -- going to school 
two nights a week, plus you're learning on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 But with work being so bad and you have to feed your family, they go out and 
get a job non-union, so they're working with their union card in their shoes 
and they supervise unqualified guys.

 A year ago the dry-wallers in O.C. had a strike. They were non-union 
dry-wallers who were coming in and underbidding the union dry-wallers. When 
they got down to where those builders were paying them 80 cents a square foot 
instead of $6 a square foot, they got mad. I see it happening again -- all 
these non-union guys out there working for 5, 6, 7 dollars an hour with no 
benefits. They're going to see that the home builder is getting top dollar for 
his house and they're getting shafted.  
</P>
<P>
 You can't support a family on that kind of money. You see three, four families 
living in a single house. How did we get to this place? It all started back 
when the air traffic controllers got zapped by President Reagan; everybody was 
down on unions after that.  
</P>
<P>
 The quality of life is unfortunately coming down. I'm lucky. I have a little 
dry cleaning business my wife runs. People are working under the table trying 
to collect unemployment -- people are on unemployment, welfare, four or five 
kids, God bless them, it's hard enough to raise even one kid. Making 4, 5, 6, 
dollars an hour you have to have three, four people working in each family to 
make a decent wage.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is changing quite a bit -- got more people unemployed then they 
ever did. The aerospace people out of work. The dry cleaning plant my wife runs 
is in Cerritos where a lot of McDonnell Douglas people live, many of them are 
out of work; 7,000 laid off last year. A lot of people are worried. They don't 
know what's going on. Used to be if you had a job you knew where you're going 
to go on vacation this summer. Now you're out worrying whether you're going to 
be working this summer.  
</P>
<P>
 I have two grown kids. I was very fortunate, not a college grad, making 
$50-55,000 a year, plus my wife was working. We bought a house, brand new, in 
1973 for $33,000 before the property started going up in Placentia next to 
Yorba Linda. Got a house, a pool, we got it nice. I'm not complaining, but my 
kids, unless you become a doctor or a lawyer I don't know how you do it.  
</P>
<P>
 Our benefits have gone to hell just like everybody else's. I used to have good 
health coverage, but it's shot now. Now we have $500 deductible per person. 
That hurts. Hopefully, that's one thing Clinton can do, work on this major 
medical insurance that's hurting everybody. People are putting off going to the 
dentist, not going to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 When my kids were growing up they had good insurance. Every time they sneezed 
my wife had them at a pediatrician. Now the guys down at the union hall are 
going to clinics instead of pediatricians with their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you live on $6 an hour? Most of the kids who are getting into the 
apprenticeship are still living at home, that's the only thing that helps them; 
they're living with their Mom and Dad.  
</P>
<P>
 The non-union guys who work live in apartments; their wives work. They're 
working 50 hours a week and paid straight time. The state says you gotta get 
time and a half for over 40 hours. But people are doing whatever they can to 
make a few bucks, you know what I'm saying? They're also working two jobs, 
pumping gas at night.  
</P>
<P>
 What every parent wants is for their kids to have something better then what 
they had -- to go on to be a success. My kids, both of them graduated from high 
school and went to college. My daughter makes pretty good money and her husband 
does too and they live in Santa Margarita in a condo; they need a bigger place. 
They have two children. My son, he's something he's always wanted to be, a cop. 
Me and the wife, we pray every night; you know what's going on in the news now 
with the cops. 
</P>
<P>
 What do I want from Clinton? I just want him to make sure American workers get 
what they're supposed to get. That's all that any worker wants. They want to 
make a decent living to raise a family. What the hell's the use of having a 
contract that pays $80 an hour if there's no work?  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has got a good labor secretary and he's trying to reverse that bill on 
the replacement of workers that Reagan put in. Which would help. The 
Constitution says a man has a right to better himself. Which means if I want to 
go on strike to better myself, I have the right. I have hopes for Clinton. I 
think I would have had hopes for anybody new to tell you the truth. We needed a 
change. We're not going to know for four years unless you got a crystal ball or 
your wife talks to the Pope. Only time will tell.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SERMON; ON MAKING 
BONDS STRONGER THAN BARRIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM KAUFMAN, Jim Kaufman is rabbi at Temple Beth Hillel in North Hollywood. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wish that God would intervene, grab the African-American and Jewish-American 
communities and shake some sense into them. I know that relationships are 
complex and multifaceted, and the one that exists between our two minority 
communities is no less so. 
</P>
<P>
 But our problems and our differences are exacerbated by public perception. 
Legitimate issues of discord and strife make the news, whether it's in the New 
York City streets or on the campuses of UCLA or Cal State Northridge. There are 
real and, in many instances, justified complaints that we have about each 
other. But in the age of the sound bite the perceptions of African Americans 
and Jewish Americans toward each other are instantly formed. Thus, it should 
not be surprising that there does not seem to be any latitude in our 
relationship. Only the bad news catches our eye; we assume that there is no 
good news. And the negative stereotypes we have about each other persist. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why "covenants" are important. A covenant is a solemn agreement 
between two entities, valid and enforceable only through the willful exercise 
and sincerity of the parties involved. As our covenant with God as partners in 
working in the world provides room for growth, change, sin and then 
forgiveness, so must the relationship between African Americans and Jewish 
Americans be covenantal. Whereas the word "contract" implies formal, legal, 
cold and impersonal agreement, "covenant" denotes feeling, passion and mutually 
earned respect. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 16 synagogues and 16 churches in Los Angeles that have entered into 
an African-American/Jewish-American covenant. Those covenants are some (surely 
not all) of the good news that exists in the relationship between African 
Americans and Jewish Americans in Los Angeles. Wilshire Boulevard Temple and 
Second Baptist Church plant trees together in MacArthur Park. First AME Church 
and Temple Isaiah are immersed in an adult study class, Temple Israel of 
Hollywood and Messiah Baptist Church have a series entitled "Ask the Rabbi, Ask 
the Pastor," Kehillat Israel and Abundance of Christ Church have created an 
internal organization called "Two Cultures and One Heart," Temple Beth Hillel 
and Faithful Service Baptist Church will visit the Museum of Tolerance 
together. All the covenants annually enjoy pulpit exchanges, with clergy, 
choirs and congregants reaffirming, through community prayer and song, the 
solemnity of our covenants. When we work, pray and sing together, the bonds 
prove stronger than the barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas a contract might facilitate some peaceful coexistence, a covenant does 
not guarantee peace at all, but rather a real relationship. The blessing of a 
covenantal relationship is that it can absorb the dissonance and 
disappointments because of its inherent intimacy. African Americans and Jewish 
Americans, clergy or lay people, through these covenants, know each other face 
to face. Covenants provide the grass-roots bonding but we must as well be 
circumspect with regard to public denouncements that erode the less visible 
gains made in real and sustained contact with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Our memory, inspiring and compelling though it may be, of rabbis and pastors 
marching arm-in-arm with Martin Luther King is only yesterday's news. Time and 
circumstance have used up the goodwill created in the '60s. Today, rabbis and 
pastors, African Americans and Jewish Americans must link arm-in-arm and create 
a history that will inspire the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
 In these post-L.A. riot years, we must establish ties with all peoples who 
constitute the marvelous, multiethnic mosaic that is Los Angeles. But 
concurrently, there is no reason to discard old coalitions and old friends. 
Barriers, real and imagined, have tested the relationship between 
African-Americans and Jewish-Americans. These covenants are testimony that 
barriers have not undermined the bonds we enjoy. There is some good news. There 
just needs to be more of it -- in the press and in the pulpit.

TUNEUP FOR A VENERABLE VEHICLE; AT 20, ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT MAY GET SOME 
IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal Endangered Species Act celebrated its 20th birthday last week. 
Rather than being a cause for celebration, the milestone has escalated an 
already angry argument that is drowning out constructive discussion of how best 
to reconcile species preservation with human development. 
</P>
<P>
 That both activities are vital should be beyond question. But one measure of 
the distortion that has occurred in the argument over congressional review and 
reauthorization of this act is a growing belief by some that one activity need 
be sacrificed to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973, declaring that diversity 
of animal and plant species has "aesthetic, ecological, educational, 
historical, recreational, and scientific value to the nation and its people." 
That value is even more salient today, as, for instance, the over-harvesting of 
some wild species like Pacific Northwest salmon threatens their viability and 
scientists are finding medicinal worth in a growing number of natural 
compounds. 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD AIM, CLUNKY MEANS: The act affirms these values by providing a mechanism 
to protect and encourage recovery of threatened and endangered species while 
also allowing for development. Landowners whose property contains animals, 
plants or insects that have been found endangered cannot harm those species 
and, in most cases, must create a habitat recovery plan to facilitate species 
regeneration. About 750 species are now on the federal endangered species list, 
with as many as 3,000 more feared to be in poor ecological health.  
</P>
<P>
 While there may be broad consensus about the need to foster biodiversity, the 
act's record of often cumbersome implementation, the growing number of species 
believed to be at risk and the absence of other strong protections for natural 
habitats have sparked a growing effort to weaken the goals of the act itself 
rather than to streamline its implementation. Yet the 20-year history of 
species protection indicates those goals remain appropriate and that, though it 
has weaknesses, overall the act works. Landowners with imperiled species on 
their property have been able to proceed with development while limiting and 
mitigating the ecological damage caused by construction. Most federal works 
projects affecting endangered species also have been completed; of more than 
than 34,000 evaluated from 1987 to 1991, federal officials had to halt only 23 
because they jeopardized species. And the act does have its major successes: 
The bald eagle, the peregrine falcon, the Pacific gray whale, the brown 
pelican, the whooping crane and other species once on the brink of extinction 
have recovered dramatically due to federal protection.  
</P>
<P>
 DON'T LOSE IT, IMPROVE IT: Yet there clearly is room for improvement. The 
first need is to better document the extent and the health of the animal and 
plant life within our borders. That vast survey effort is already under way, 
begun last year by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Results from this national 
biodiversity survey should lower the volume some in debates over which species 
are close to extinction and to what degree. 
</P>
<P>
 The second task is to improve the application of the act. Legislation 
introduced by Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) would do 
that. Their bill would set deadlines for completion of recovery plans and 
increase funding to allow the federal agencies charged with enforcement of the 
act to be more responsive. The measure would also encourage strategies to 
preserve entire habitats rather than individual species, thus avoiding 
potential conflicts between plans for different species in the same area. 
California has taken the lead in this approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill deserves support because Baucus and Chafee recognize that the act 
they would amend is still needed.

 Gee, did I miss something back in the dear dead '70s? According to Kevin 
Phillips ("Just When Clinton Felt Safe in the Water," Opinion, Dec. 26) Richard 
Nixon was impeached! He correctly states that Johnson, Reagan and Bush "were 
the subject of some impeachment talk." Phillips may only be guilty of wishful 
thinking, rather than historical ignorance, but I am surprised that your 
editors didn't catch the error.

SOUTH-CENTRAL'S GARDEN OF PRIDE; FOOD PROJECT OF CRENSHAW HIGH STUDENTS WINS 
$50,000 FROM RLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Food From the 'Hood is a fledging venture in South-Central Los Angeles, and 
its young, home-grown founders hope to make the retail food company a local 
success to be emulated. The group is off to a splendid start, having just 
received a $50,000 grant from Rebuild L.A., now known as RLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture is a private/public effort, all the more notable because such 
grass-roots partnerships will be increasingly important to reviving urban 
neighborhoods in a time of tight government funds. And to think it all started 
with a patch of land behind one of the classrooms at Crenshaw High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The land, designated for agricultural use back in the 1960s, had lain fallow 
for many years for lack of funds. Biology teacher Tammy Bird and her students, 
with the help of the nonprofit group Gardens for Kids, planted the patch a year 
ago. The project became Food From the 'Hood, a produce business that just 
completed a harvest of lettuce, collard greens and other vegetables that will 
be distributed to needy families in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative and hard work got the students this far. Now for some enterprise. 
Food From the 'Hood will use the RLA grant to produce and market a salad 
dressing based on its own basil and garlic recipe. The students' understanding 
of the process, planning and problems of running a business came from corporate 
and business people such as consultant Melinda McMullen, RLA official Susan 
Gonzalez, a Hawthorne-based salad dressing company named Sweet Adelaide and 
Norris Bernstein, creator of Bernstein's salad dressing. Financier Kirk 
Kerkorian's Lincy Foundation funded the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Food From the 'Hood succeed, profits will be used for scholarships and 
to help others in the community. We hope it does. Even small entrepreneurial 
steps can empower communities with a sense of independence and pride.

MICHAEL JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have never met Michael Jackson and have seen very little of him on 
television. I am in no way a fan of his. But under our American justice system 
he is supposedly innocent until proven guilty. If he is found guilty by a jury 
of his peers, then he should be given a life sentence (as anyone convicted of 
this offense should be); if he is found innocent, there is nothing that can 
remove all of the mud that has been smeared over his name. His so-called 
friends and ex-employees keep crawling out from under rocks to tell everyone 
how much Michael has meant to them and how bad he has been. Thank God this kid 
has Elizabeth Taylor in his corner. 
</P>
<P>

 With all the money that Michael Jackson has, why doesn't he just buy up all 
those (expletive) tabloid gossip sheets and then burn them to the ground -- as 
a public service.

<P>
 The NAACP is correct ("NAACP Questions Media Coverage of Jackson Case," Dec. 
21). Michael Jackson is being persecuted by the media because he is an African 
American. The evidence of media prejudice is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was Woody Allen's personal life dissected and scrutinized in public, if 
not because he is a Jew? And why is Madonna constantly being criticized if not 
that she is Italian? And why is Ted Kennedy dogged so ruthlessly, except that 
he is Irish and Catholic? Bill Clinton nearly lost the election, and is being 
hounded again, because of reporters' bigoted attitudes against poor white 
Southern boys. 
</P>
<P>
 When will this nonsense end?

<P>
 The incessant whining of many "black leaders" has grown so shrill that soon 
only dogs will be able to hear them. 
</P>
<P>
 The NAACP called a press conference to deplore what it calls a mass-media 
conspiracy to crush Michael Jackson and other prominent black Americans. "This 
is not only about Michael Jackson," said Shannon Reeves, the NAACP's West Coast 
director, "but about how the media uses its power to continue to aid in the 
oppression and degradation of African Americans in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 While the NAACP correctly denounces the media's unquenchable thirst for 
titillation and lust to indict, try and convict people on the flimsiest of 
evidence, this is no anti-black matter. Thanks to America's hyperactive press, 
Woody Allen will be seen for years as some sort of child molester although 
Connecticut prosecutors never charged him with anything.  
</P>
<P>
 The NAACP also overlooked the "media bigots" who helped build Michael Jackson 
into a supernova in the first place. Who can forget the "racist" press' outrage 
when Michael Jordan's father was murdered? How about the media-led national 
cry-in when Magic Johnson declared he was HIV-positive?  
</P>
<P>
 As a black American I feel the NAACP does us all a disservice when it screams 
"Racism!" as carelessly as the boy who cried "Wolf!" The next time it 
justifiably reports that bigotry has reared its ugly head, only the dogs will 
be listening.

 The four-minute Michael Jackson recorded message has just been televised (Dec. 
22). I cannot believe that any individual, famous or infamous, should be 
subjected to such indignities by having pictures taken of his genitals, 
buttocks and thighs by the the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department and 
the Los Angeles Police Department. Could not this have been handled by two 
physicians (one representing the defense and one the accusers) examining him 
and describing their findings in detail? L.A. is just recovering from the 
notoriety of excessive police force, the Denny affair and the riots. To subject 
Michael Jackson to this humiliation is to let the world know that man's 
inhumanity to man is alive and well in Southern California.

 Michael Jackson's maudlin televised bleats were really the ultimate in 
arrogance and hypocrisy! Out of one side of his mouth, he vilifies the 
"incredible, terrible mass media," which he gladly used to hold "the biggest 
press conference in the world" -- the same media which have made him the 
celebrity he is. From the other side of his mouth, he shrieks about the 
"horrifying nightmare" of having had his body "inspected and photographed" -- 
as though he were a nun, taken unaware by a peeping Tom, at her ablutions! 
Jackson lives and breathes to have his body "inspected and photographed"; it is 
impossible to watch him on TV for more than a minute or two without seeing him 
groping, etc., the precise areas of his anatomy (for all the world to see) that 
he apparently feels are too sacred and private for a legitimate, one-time 
inspection by investigators, which might clear him of suspicion (if he is 
innocent). Adding insult to injury, he has the nerve to squeak out scriptural 
quotations.

DEBATE OVER IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to your Dec. 20 editorial, 41% of the 810,635 legal immigrants in 
1992, or 332,361 people, decided California was the place they ought to be. The 
Times then deduced that all 332,361 new arrivals landed on public relief: "It 
is both unfair and unwise to ask California taxpayers to pick up the tab for 
this." Not a Beverly Hillbilly among 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you willing to state explicitly, and do you have the numbers to back it 
up, that not a single one of those immigrants became contributors to the tax 
base that so ill-supports California's schools, libraries and public hospitals? 
Before we assume that we earlier immigrants are supporting all these 
ne'er-do-well nouveaux arrivees, we should look at how well they are supporting 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 CECELIA E. HENDERSON

<P>
 Your editorial was excellent in pointing out the reason for people's anger 
against immigration. Economically, it just isn't fair. The majority of the 
benefit from the work of immigrants goes to factory owners and upper-income 
individuals who employ domestic help. The majority of the cost goes to "Joe and 
Jane Sixpack Taxpayer" whose state and local income taxes are going to pay for 
the social costs of these immigrants and who get nothing but inferior schools, 
diluted law enforcement protection, strained sewer, water and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the new arrivals, who you describe as having bountiful energy and 
entrepreneurial spirit, are working under the table. They are not paying taxes 
and they are sending money to their home countries to the detriment of 
revitalizing the Southern California economy. It just isn't fair. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBYN TURNER 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu 
</P>
<P>
 Your editorial points the finger at Washington. You are pointing in the right 
direction. However, it is not U.S. immigration policy that causes people to 
migrate here without documents. It is, rather, caused in part by a flawed U.S. 
foreign policy, including economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point is the flawed disastrous policy toward Haiti. George Bush did 
too little when Jean-Bertrand Aristide was overthrown by in 1991 and Bill 
Clinton is too late! Haitians are dying as a result. U.S. policy is killing 
them!

A WAR ON INFORMATION IN THE BALKANS; THE PRESS FINDS ITSELF UNDER FIRE -- 
SOMETIMES LITERALLY -- FROM SEVERAL DIRECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As war continues in the Balkans with equally little prospect either for 
victory by one side or for peace, it becomes steadily more tempting for foreign 
governments to pronounce all sides equally reprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
 If all are equally bad, then intervening for one against another must also be 
reprehensible. And since, on unrelated grounds, the West has clearly decided 
not to intervene, it is happy to have this balm for its troubled conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Full reporting of the facts might prevent the balm of perfect neutrality from 
having its intended effect, but full reporting -- never easy in war -- has been 
particularly difficult in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbia-Montenegro -- what remains of the former Yugoslav federation -- has 
passed from communism directly to fascism. Under either system, the press is a 
tool of the state. And, judging the world press by its own standards, the Serbs 
commonly regard it as an extension of the same world political consensus that 
supports severe economic sanctions against them. The press also receives 
intermittently hostile treatment from the Bosnians, who see themselves deceived 
by the West, and from the Croats, whose own press has degenerated to propaganda 
and who believe that they have lost territory through Western complicity with 
the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 One result: 35 journalists killed in Bosnia and Croatia during the past two 
years; dozens more wounded, attacked, abducted or subjected to the confiscation 
of their equipment, often with specific reference to stories they had written. 
The further, inevitable result: an erosion in the quality of battlefield 
reporting from this war. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostility on the part of the belligerents cannot easily be remedied, but a 
less-well-known part of the problem is coolness toward the press on the part of 
the United Nations. The world body has been increasingly reluctant to maintain 
its policy of transporting accredited journalists on relief flights on a 
space-available basis, claiming that it fears lawsuits by journalists in the 
event of a crash. The Committee to Protect Journalists, however, has rightly 
urged the use on flights of the same simple liability waiver that the United 
Nations has required of journalists riding its personnel carriers in Sarajevo. 
Last June, according to a report in the fall CPJ Quarterly, U.N. Undersecretary 
General Kofi Annan promised an end to discrimination against the press, but so 
far no change has come. 
</P>
<P>
 Information is vital to the functioning of the United Nations in the Balkans 
if only because it is vital to maintaining an international awareness of the 
region and its needs. Perhaps the U.N. role in the Balkans is nearing an end; 
but so long as the international body has any kind of on-the-ground role in the 
area, it should treat the press as its ally.

WHAT WOULD MOSES SAY? BELIEF IS BEYOND WORDS; SCRIPTURE: AN ISRAELI RABBI'S 
COMMAND THAT SOLDIERS DISOBEY ORDERS RAISES ANEW THE QUESTION OF LITERAL VS. 
SPIRITUAL TRUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES, Jack Miles, a member of The Times editorial board, is completing 
a book on God as the literary protagonist of the Bible. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Dec. 19, Rabbi Shlomo Goren, a former chief rabbi of Israel and of the 
Israeli armed forces, urged the country's soldiers to disobey any orders to 
remove Jewish settlers from the West Bank, Gaza Strip or Golan Heights. "The 
soldiers must refuse this order," Goren asserted. "Any order that contradicts 
the law of Moses is a rebellion against Moses, against Torah, against Judaism 
and against the Almighty, and it must, absolutely must, be rejected and 
refused." On a television program he added: "The command to settle the land of 
Israel is greater than all the commandments put together." 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of Goren has been widespread in Israel, ranging from calls for his 
condemnation to Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer's demand that he be tried 
for treason: "A man like this should face a military court-martial." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue, obviously, are the questions of whether the statutory law of the 
state of Israel takes precedence over Torah and whether civil leaders outrank 
religious leaders. Israel was founded in the 20th Century as a secular state, 
but for centuries before that new founding, its identity and collective life 
were transmitted under religious auspices. No one should be surprised that the 
nation's religious past intrudes into its relatively secular present. 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders may legitimately ask, how-ever, how thoroughly Rabbi Goren intends 
Moses' prescriptions regarding the land to be observed. In the book of 
Deuteronomy, one of the five books of Moses that make up Torah, Moses instructs 
the Israelites, just before they cross the Jordan River, to divide the native 
peoples of the Promised Land into those who are to be enslaved and those who 
are to be exterminated. A city that surrenders peacefully will be allowed the 
mercy of mere enslavement. One that resists will suffer the extermination of 
all its males and the seizure of its women and children, animals and all other 
goods as booty. In the core area, however, the area that contains "the cities 
of those peoples that the Lord your God gives you for an inheritance," God 
orders genocide: "You shall save nothing that breathes, but you shall utterly 
destroy them . . . that they may not teach you to do according to all their 
abominable practices which they have done in the service of their gods. . . . " 
(20:10-18). In the book of Joshua, this order is carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us presume that in the second founding of Israel, some of the rules that 
governed the first founding no longer apply. The question may still be asked: 
Why do they no longer apply? 
</P>
<P>
 One reason might be historical revisionism. Old Testament historians do not 
believe that Moses ever spoke the book-long speech that contains the order to 
kill all that breathes. Moreover, though "ethnic cleansing" of this sort may 
have been widespread among all ancient peoples in time of war, historians do 
not believe that the invading Israelites achieved anything close to the 
immediate and total subjugation of the native peoples of Canaan. By the Bible's 
own witness, the last of the natives were enslaved only centuries later by King 
Solomon, who conscripted them to build his temple (1 Kings 9:20-21). 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible then, for those who wish to observe Torah in general but not to 
observe this particular part of it, to use history as an escape clause. But 
consider now another biblical scandal: 
</P>
<P>
 In the famous scene in the Gospel according to Matthew, Pontius Pilate "washes 
his hands" of the death of Jesus as he surrenders to the blood-lust of the mob. 
"So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was 
beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, 'I am 
innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves.' And all the people 
answered, 'His blood be on us and on our children!' Then he released for them 
Barabbas, and, having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified" (27: 
24-25). 
</P>
<P>
 The "people" here are the Jews of ancient Jerusalem. The line, "His blood be 
on us and on our children," has provided a scriptural warrant for 2,000 years 
of Christian persecution of the "Christ-killers." If official Christianity 
refuses to hear this verse as an invitation to persecute the Jews, on what 
basis does it do so? 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, history provides one possible basis. Revisionist New Testament 
historians doubt that the dramatic hand-washing ever took place, much less that 
the Jews allegedly in attendance ever called down blood guilt on their 
offspring. The scene is understood to have been written after the fact for 
polemic purposes. There were several kinds of tension in the early Christian 
church, including theological disagreement between the Jewish founders of the 
church and their Gentile converts. One form of attack -- indirect but extremely 
bitter -- was to allege that one's opponents, or their forebears, had been 
murderous enemies of Jesus during his lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 But how much difference does it make whether the line was actually spoken or 
not? Those who suppose that by proving it unhistorical they destroy its malign 
effect play a risky game. Suppose it was actually, historically, spoken. Would 
that constitute any warrant for a continuation of anti-Semitism? Obviously, it 
would not. History, revised or unrevised, is no more authoritative than 
religious leaders choose to make it, a fact that historians, for all their 
sophistication in detail, sometimes forget. One noted New Testament scholar 
recently declared that biblical scholars have a "moral responsibility to 
determine what belongs to the fundamental cultural legacies of Christianity and 
Judaism." He is mistaken. This is the moral responsibility of religious rather 
than academic leadership, and discharging it will, on occasion, entail 
deliberately disregarding history. Sadly, this is just what Rabbi Goren seems 
unwilling to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The average Israeli (settlers in the occupied territories are not average 
Israelis) wants only harmony with the Palestinians in a land that they must 
share, whatever was said 3,000 years ago on the far side of the Jordan River. 
The average Christian wants only harmony with the Jews, whatever was said 2,000 
years ago in Roman Jerusalem. Tragically, fundamentalists can be found in both 
religious communities who invoke the Bible in support of reprehensible 
positions. But their views are in disrepute and would deserve to be in 
disrepute whatever their historical pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
 The crucial move within the scriptural religions of the West -- Islam, 
eventually, as well as Judaism and Christianity -- is not to revise scripture 
but to revise the attitude taken toward scripture. In bringing about this 
revision, historical investigation can be enormously liberating, but finally 
there can and must be a second liberation from history itself. What counts in 
the end is not separating the historical from the unhistorical but separating 
the acceptable from the unacceptable.

PERSPECTIVE ON SELF-RESPECT; REJECTION IS THE SERVANT OF AIDS; FOR YOUNG GAYS, 
FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAYFORD KYTLE , Rayford Kytle is deputy director of the news office of the 
U.S. Public Health Service. This is adapted from a speech he gave last month to 
USPHS employees. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to tell everybody who has young people in their lives -- parents, aunts 
and uncles, neighbors or just members of the community -- that some of these 
young people are gay, and some are struggling, alone, to come to terms with 
their sexual orientation. I want everybody to know that they can help to create 
a climate of tolerance, acceptance, love and support for these kids, so that 
they care enough about themselves, think highly enough of themselves, to want 
to stay healthy and live fulfilling, responsible lives. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to tell what it was like for me growing up, coming to terms with being 
gay, and how HIV entered and influenced my life. I think the difficulties I had 
in developing a positive self-concept are still problems for many young gay 
people. And I think it is these problems that cause many young gay men to 
behave in ways that put them at high risk for becoming infected with HIV, the 
virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since early childhood I knew there was something different about me, but 
it had never been clear to me how I was different. 
</P>
<P>
 About the age of 15, in 1962, when I was in 10th grade, I began to be aware 
that I was sexually attracted to other males. No one "recruited" me, no one 
abused me. These feelings came from deep inside me. 
</P>
<P>
 I come from a good family, went to good schools and lived in good 
neighborhoods. I was popular in school, made good grades and was active in the 
church. I wanted to become a Presbyterian minister. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of all these advantages and connections, as I began to be aware of my 
sexual orientation, I was completely alone. I had no role models, no positive 
images of gay men, no social support as a gay male, no one to turn to. I 
couldn't tell my family -- it was just too horrible, too unacceptable, 
unspeakable. I couldn't tell my friends -- the worst thing you could possibly 
be was queer. I couldn't tell my teachers or my pastor. The only place I saw to 
turn to was medicine. I read in a church guidance counselor's office that 
homosexuality could be cured, like a disease.  
</P>
<P>
 I spent the next 12 years in and out of therapy, trying to erase, to hide this 
important part of myself from others and, most of all, from myself. 
</P>
<P>
 The climate of prejudice and ignorance about gay people that I grew up in 
interfered with my life and slowed my development as a self-respecting, 
responsible, contributing member of society. It caused me to grow up doubting 
myself, feeling ashamed and frightened of my deepest feelings. How was I to 
find my calling in life -- my career, work to give my heart and soul to, a 
direction for my life -- how was I to find what really mattered to me when 
there was such a deep and significant part of me that I was trying to ignore, 
to deny, to hide, to kill? 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting my sexual orientation at the age of 27 was a great awakening, like 
being born -- finally accepting my feelings, my self, turning a light on inside 
and no longer running away from what I saw there. It took many more years for 
me to overcome the self-hatred and self-doubt I had learned and to develop a 
healthy sense of who I was and what I wanted to do with my life. 
</P>
<P>
 During those early years of my gay life, sex was for me a means of validation, 
of endorsement. I needed frequent assurance that people liked me and valued me, 
because I had so little self-esteem, so little self-respect. It took me a long 
time to understand my insecurity, to overcome it and to establish a committed 
monogamous relationship based on mutual understanding, respect and affection. 
</P>
<P>
 But by that time, I had become infected with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that by talking and writing about my experience with HIV, I can help 
young gay people learn the things that took me so long to learn; I want them to 
learn these things earlier than I did -- in time to protect them from HIV. I 
don't want them to waste their time and energy hiding from themselves; I want 
them to come to terms with their lives earlier than I did, to develop a healthy 
sense of self-respect and a sense of responsibility to themselves and to the 
community. I want them to find work that they are passionate about, that they 
are able to respond to with all their resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Our youth need positive images -- images of gay people who are in committed 
relationships, who are responsible members of the community, images that 
promote healthy and responsible choices by gay youth. The period when they are 
beginning to become aware of their sexual orientation is when they are most 
vulnerable, most in danger of falling prey to the climate of intolerance toward 
gay people, most in danger of becoming isolated, most in danger of developing 
low self-esteem, which leads to self-destructive behaviors -- alcohol and drug 
abuse and suicide. And to unsafe sex, which puts them at risk for all sexually 
transmitted diseases and particularly HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to tell all our young people, gay or not, that they should wait to 
have sex until they really know who they are and have a healthy sense of 
self-respect, to wait until they are ready to commit to someone they really 
know, care about and respect -- someone who really knows them, respects and 
cares about them. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have created a negative attitude toward homosexuality as a parent, 
relative, friend, teacher, pastor or neighbor, it may be too late to change 
that by the time you find out that your child is gay or lesbian. By then you 
may have done that child great harm. We must let children know at an early age 
that their sexuality is a beautiful part of their lives and that it is to be 
valued and protected and respected. We must let them know that if they turn out 
to be gay or lesbian, they will still have our love and respect and we will 
still be there for them, and that we want them to feel a part of the family and 
the community. I think the way we do this is to let young people know by our 
behavior and our attitudes that there are gays and lesbians who are respectable 
members of the community. We have to show young people by our behavior toward 
gays and lesbians in general that whether a person is good or bad, responsible 
or irresponsible does not depend on his or her sexual orientation any more than 
it does on his or her race, religion or gender.

LONG AGO AND FAR AWAY . . . ; FRIENDSHIP: A JOURNALIST WHOSE FAME WAS 
ESTABLISHED IN EUROPE'S WARS BIDS FAREWELL TO A HERO WHO DIED AFTER HALF A 
CENTURY IN ANONYMITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GELLHORN, Martha Gellhorn has written volumes as a war correspondent 
(as recently as the Panama invasion), essayist and novelist. Her latest book is 
The Novellas of Martha Gellhorn (Alfred A. Knopf, 1993). A former wife of 
Ernest Hemingway, she lives in London and Wales. Her friend Fred Keller died 
Dec. 16 after a fire at his home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This cannot be an obituary, since those are reserved for famous successful 
people, nor can it be In Memoriam, as that sounds pompous about a man who never 
wasted a minute of his life being pompous. So I think it is a farewell letter 
to my friend Freddy Keller who died from burns received in a stupid needless 
everyday accident, a fire in his small house. 
</P>
<P>
 I would never have written such a letter to Freddy alive; he would have been 
embarrassed for us both, thinking I was off my rocker, gone soppy with age. We 
did not exchange paeans of praise, though there was much love and understanding 
in our letters. We were mainly telling each other with irony our views of the 
world. We saw the world from different geographical angles, he from California, 
I from Britain, but we shared a similar way of looking, though he was funnier 
and sharper. 
</P>
<P>
 Freddy was 80 years old, five years my junior. We belonged to a vanishing 
breed, people who had in common the experience of two wars. Freddy lived 
through those wars at the cutting edge, the infantry, while I was a spectator. 
I now realize that I have known Freddy Keller for 56 years and know almost 
nothing about his personal life. We saw each other seldom, the last time 20 
years ago. We wrote erratically. I needed the certainty that such a man lived; 
it was a kind of private reassurance about our species. It is not often, it is 
practically never, that you can put absolute trust in the quality of another 
human being.  
</P>
<P>
 Probably we first met in Madrid in the spring of 1937. I am unsure about this 
as about all dates. Freddy fought in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the 
International Brigades in the Spanish War. He would have been in Madrid on 
leave, one of the wonderfully funny Americans who drifted in and out of the 
lives of reporters there. He had a short, square, tough body, mouse-blond hair, 
an Irish face, noteworthy because of its liveliness and because of the small 
bright blue eyes that looked at everything with unfaltering honesty and 
generally with amusement. Humor is a hallmark of the brave. They do not know 
they are brave. They downplay whatever happens by joking. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time I saw him was in Barcelona, in the summer of 1938, after the 
terrible retreat from the Ebro, the last big battle of the war. Freddy had swum 
the Ebro with a machine-gun bullet in his thigh, which was taken as cause for 
merriment and congratulation. The Ebro is a wide, deep, cold, gray river with a 
deadly current running to the sea. I have only now learned that Freddy swam the 
river several times, ferrying wounded comrades across. You would have to be 
heroic about pain and very strong to manage that. Freddy of course never spoke 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the war, our war, ended in defeat and none of us ever got over it in our 
hearts. We loved Spain and believed that it was the place where fascism must be 
stopped, the last chance. All the foreigners in Spain hated fascism for all 
their own different reasons. The Spanish people knew exactly what they were 
fighting and suffering for, and their fears proved true when Franco won. Since 
the governments of the Western democracies, in their folly, abandoned the duly 
elected government of the Republic of Spain, we were certain that the big war 
would follow, as it did five months and two days after Franco's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI branded everyone who had been in Spain, but above all the Lincoln 
vets, as dangerous reds, to be monitored with suspicion. (Through the Freedom 
of Information Act, which ought to be called the Freedom of Partial Information 
Act, I have seen my own small file with its wildly silly snooping accusations.) 
Later, when the United States joined the Second World War, the "red" brand was 
altered to "premature anti-fascist," though this did not cancel the FBI's 
hostile attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Freddy was able to sign up as a private in the 82nd Airborne 
Division. It was not easy for the Lincoln vets to be allowed to go on fighting 
fascism. The men of the 82nd were all volunteers, used in the harshest actions 
in Europe. I had no idea that Freddy was somewhere among those crack troops, 
though I was often with the 82nd during the war. I did not know until now that 
Freddy earned the Bronze Star for bravery. In those days and in that division, 
decorations were rare. To win this distinction as a private, Freddy must have 
done something of remarkable courage. Of course, he never told me. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first winter after the war, the 82nd was the American occupying force 
in Berlin, a city bombed into a vastness of jagged teeth. We Americans, the few 
reporters and the troops, were forbidden by the commanding general of the 82nd 
to cross the dividing Russian-American line into the Alexanderplatz, a huge 
loot market where cigarettes were the usual money. Two colleagues and I were 
nervously there, trying to sell a hideous brown tweed suit, sent up by Robert 
Capa, who was being held captive in the Lincoln Hotel in Paris until he paid 
his poker debts. In that milling crowd, Freddy suddenly appeared. He was 
neither buying nor selling; he was risking disciplinary punishment, I am sure, 
to see the Russian soldiers. The Alexanderplatz was full of them. In my memory, 
they were big, fair-haired, sloppily uniformed young men, like country hicks 
for the first time in a city. They were obsessed by watches. They all wanted to 
buy watches. 
</P>
<P>
 Freddy, never a communist, a born though detached Catholic, believed in 
socialism. Not knowing Russia, as none of us did, he believed or hoped, or 
both, that socialism existed there, a dream of equality and justice for 
workers, his kind of people. Freddy was in the Alexanderplatz looking at his 
heroes. We hugged each other and laughed and I lost track of him again. One of 
the many features of war is this: Everything changes, everyone meets by chance, 
everyone disappears to someplace else. I think the mind adapts to the chaos of 
war by becoming chaotic too. 
</P>
<P>
 Freddy's life after the big war must have been filled with many jobs. I know 
of only one because he loved it and wrote or spoke of it: He was an engine 
driver on the trains, what trains or where I do not know. In all these years we 
did not see each other's houses; we wrote letters. He never complained of 
anything, he was always funny, he was always clear and unmuddled in his 
thinking. He did not bother with accepted versions of politics, he was not 
touched by the hysterias that afflicted America in the postwar years. He went 
on sturdily, obscure, hard-up, unsuccessful by the going rates of judging 
success. He was a tremendous success by the only standards that matter: 
honesty, loyalty, courage, and a beautiful lack of vanity. He was his own man 
for 80 years. He was one of the best men I ever knew.

 HO-HUM RACE: The 1994 race to succeed retiring Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Ed Edelman, whose 3rd District includes much of the San Fernando Valley, is 
likely to be devoid of drama. Los Angeles Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky is deemed 
a shoe-in to win in the June primary. . . . Package this race and sell it to 
insomniacs. 
</P>
<P>
 NOT SO HO-HUM: But the race to fill Yaroslavsky's seat may make the Oklahoma 
land rush look orderly. It should provide a release for years of frustrated 
ambition building among Westside wanna-bes. . . . The next question: Will the 
Valley side of Yaroslavsky's 5th District, which includes Sherman Oaks and Van 
Nuys, produce any candidates? 
</P>
<P>
 GOP DREAM: Republicans are hoping 1994 will be the year they oust Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). The GOP Establishment is focusing on Richard 
Sybert, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, as its champion. . . . But before 
Sybert can go against Beilenson, he must beat back challengers like Robert 
Hammer, a Newbury Park banking consultant, in the GOP primary. If Sybert wins 
the primary, expect him to mount a well-heeled campaign with GOP money raised 
nationwide.

 KATZ DILEMMA: Supporters of Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) say privately 
that their guy might be tempted to run for Hal Bernson's Los Angeles City 
Council seat representing the northwest Valley. Term limits will evict Katz 
from the Assembly by 1996. . . . Bernson's term expires June 30, 1995. But 
challengers should begin making their moves in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 LINING UP: If Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North Hollywood) runs in 1994 
for the Van Nuys-based seat of another term limits victim, state Sen. David 
Roberti, expect a fairly fierce fight to succeed Friedman. . . . Already, the 
Democratic primary field includes school board member Julie Korenstein, Deputy 
City Atty. Gary Geuss and Bernson deputy Francine Oschin.

 WEATHER WATCH: Words seldom used by residents of Ventura County unless talking 
to relatives in the Midwest: frostbite , wind-chill factor , slush , 
hypothermia. . . . Even our coldest temperatures this month seem balmy compared 
with those in other parts of the country. . . . Fargo, N. D., for example, 
averages a high of 4 degrees and a low of minus 4, with the wind-chill factor 
often hitting 70 below zero. . . . The nation's hot spot in January? Honolulu, 
with an average low of only 66. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW LIFE: Robert V. Biroschak was 50 when he gave up his law practice in 1989 
to study for the Roman Catholic priesthood (Voices, B11). . . . Now associate 
pastor at Our Lady of the Assumption in Ventura, Father Bob was never married 
and didn't really surprise friends by becoming a priest. . . . "Religion was 
always important to me, but I wasn't a church mouse," he said. "At 8 or 9, I 
knew I wanted to be a priest, but it took me a long time to say yes." He has no 
ambitions other than "to be the best priest I can be." 
</P>
<P>
 LOW BRIDGES: A project to build a new bridge over Santa Paula Freeway will 
cost $6.5 million more than expected (B1). . . . But the bridges of Ventura 
County -- hey, good title for a book -- didn't always cost megabucks. The 
county's first cement span, the Harmon Barranca Bridge on Telephone Road in 
Ventura, was built in 1896 for $9,500. . . . In 1912, the Ventura River Bridge 
cost $49,626. . . . The longest bridge in county history, a 300-foot span 
crossing Sespe Creek in Fillmore, was destroyed by high water in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
 ROAD REPAIRS: Buried deep beneath the pavement, a worn-out traffic signal 
detector has been causing dangerous conditions at the intersection of Agoura 
Road and Westlake Boulevard, but the city of Thousand Oaks plans to correct the 
problem later this month (Street Smart, B1). . . . After scores of complaints 
by motorists, Oxnard restriped Rose Avenue to allow safer access into the 
Shopping at the Rose parking lot. Cold Month

REV. ALFRED BOEDDEKER; FOUNDER OF SOCIAL PROGRAMS IN BAY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Alfred Boeddeker, founder of St. Anthony's dining room, has died at 
age 90. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeddeker died Saturday of heart failure after suffering a heart attack 
several weeks ago and a mild stroke just before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeddeker, a Franciscan priest, opened the dining room doors on Oct. 4, 1950, 
after discovering that when people using food vouchers went to receive their 
meals, they were handed food through the restaurants' back doors. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day, the dining room served 350 meals. Today, volunteers serve an 
average of 2,100 meals a day. 
</P>
<P>
 From the dining room sprouted several other programs for the city's 
downtrodden, including educational programs, a health clinic and housing for 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeddeker was born Aug. 7, 1903, in San Francisco and baptized at St. Boniface 
Church. His family moved to Oakland after the 1906 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 18, he joined the Franciscans as a novice at St. Elizabeth's Friary in 
Oakland. He studied further in Santa Barbara and was ordained a priest in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 He also studied linguistics at the International University of San Antonio in 
Rome and at UC Berkeley. He studied Italian, Spanish, German, Japanese, Chinese 
and Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeddeker worked at the Old Mission Santa Barbara and St. Raphael Church in 
Goleta and went on to teach theology. 
</P>
<P>
 He taught at the Franciscan Theologate in Santa Barbara for 15 years and then 
returned to San Francisco as pastor at St. Boniface in 1949. He retired as 
executive director of the St. Anthony's Foundation in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his retirement, Boeddeker continued working with various organizations 
to eliminate hunger worldwide.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; GAY STUDENTS' RIGHTS MUST BE AFFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some parents and students at Fountain Valley High School are putting an 
enormous amount of pressure on the school board to prevent a group of gay 
students from continuing to hold support meetings on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The board should stand by the administration's initial backing of the gay 
support group and affirm the rights of the students to meet without 
interference or harassment.  
</P>
<P>
 Providing a meeting place for the students is the law of the land under the 
1984 Equal Access Act, and the Supreme Court has said that schools allowing 
extracurricular activities must not pick and choose which groups get access to 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing the group to meet free of persecution is also the right thing to do. 
Public schools are important to the nation's efforts to come to terms with its 
diversity. They should be setting a standard for young people and for the 
society at large by encouraging tolerance and understanding on campus. They 
must not succumb to the pressure tactics of well-intentioned but misguided 
zealots. 
</P>
<P>
 When demonstrations against the gay support group broke out at the school this 
fall, the administration properly cracked down on students who were 
distributing flyers in an effort to force the support group off the premises. 
But then opponents of the group turned up the heat; more than 200 people showed 
up at a meeting last month to debate the issue. Principal Gary Ernst has 
lamented the polarization of the school and community that the issue has 
brought on. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach Union High School District's board of trustees is clearly 
feeling the heat. The district's equal access policy, which allows the group 
and other non-curricular organizations to use school facilities during 
non-instructional time if they abide by certain conditions, is sound. When the 
board takes up the issue later this month, it should affirm the policy.

 Scripps Sells English-Language San Juan Star: The San Juan Star, Puerto Rico's 
only English-language daily newspaper, has been sold to a group of U.S. and 
Puerto Rican investors, the newspaper reported Sunday. Scripps Howard, the 
Cincinnati-based publishing unit of E.W. Scripps, did not reveal the purchase 
price, the paper said.But the Star estimated it as between $10 million and $14 
million, and said the latter figure was he book value of the paper. The 
purchaser is Santa Rita Acquisitions Inc., a Delaware corporation formed by a 
group of U.S. and Puerto Rican investors. The newspaper, which has a 
circulation of about 40,000, said he sale followed a difficult year, with 
revenues totaling $16.5 million and a net loss projected at nearly $500,000.

STREET SMART: DRIVER COMPLAINTS PROMPT NEW OXNARD STREET STRIPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The recent widening of Rose Avenue between the Ventura Freeway overpass and 
Gonzales Avenue has created confusion and a possible traffic hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-block on Rose Avenue, where it meets the entrance to the Shopping at the 
Rose parking lot, traffic signs say all traffic in the southbound right lane 
must turn right. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that any law-abiding southbound driver who was planning to turn 
right at the end of the block onto Gonzales has to stay in the middle lane for 
the first half of the block, to avoid turning in at the shopping center, and 
then has to swerve into the right lane to turn right at the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 What ends up happening is that drivers in the right lane who don't want to 
turn in at the shopping center ignore the signs that say "right turn only" and 
continue down to the end of the block. 
</P>
<P>
 This causes people like me, who are trying to get into the right lane, to have 
to stop and wait until it is safe to enter the right lane. This puts me at risk 
of a rear-end collision. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to solve this problem would be to add an extra right-turn pocket for 
shopping center traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Another solution would be to legally allow traffic in the existing right lane 
to either turn right into the parking lot or go straight to the end of the 
block. 
</P>
<P>
 Can either of these changes be made? 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Robert Newcomer, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Ask and it shall be given. 
</P>
<P>
 So many motorists called the city of Oxnard to complain about the confusing 
markings that the striping was recently redone, Oxnard Transportation Manager 
Samia Maximous says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were planning these lanes, there were many ways we could have done 
it," Maximous said. "The one we chose seemed like it was not too great 
operationally." 
</P>
<P>
 To fix the problem, a new lane was created for drivers turning right into the 
shopping center. A second lane is now designated for motorists who wish to turn 
right at the end of the block onto Gonzales, Maximous says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 A traffic signal timing problem has developed recently on Agoura Road in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, traffic has really been backing up on Agoura where it intersects with 
Westlake Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 This is especially a problem in the left-turn lane from westbound Agoura to 
Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like the timing has been changed on the light so that only four cars 
can get through, causing traffic backups and tempting drivers to run the red 
light, which they often do. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortened light has made this a very dangerous intersection. Can the 
timing be changed to allow more cars to go through? 
</P>
<P>
 Barb Minnehan, Westlake Village 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The problem at Agoura and Westlake is worn-out traffic signal detectors, 
Thousand Oaks Traffic Engineer John Helliwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 The city discovered the malfunctioning signal detectors several weeks ago 
during a routine check. The copper detectors, which are buried under the 
pavement, usually last about five years, but they sometimes need to be replaced 
more often at heavily trafficked intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars should be moving at their old pace when the detectors are replaced later 
this month, Helliwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I found the response to a letter in your Dec. 20 column very disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 A concerned citizen had written to alert you to a problem at Rockfield Street 
and Lindero Canyon Road in Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer described the heavy traffic at that intersection and hoped for a 
traffic signal or some other quick solution. 
</P>
<P>
 But it seems that the city of Thousand Oaks has not made this project a 
priority. Although traffic is extremely heavy, you wrote that the city is not 
planning to install a signal for another two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic Engineer John Helliwell said much of the traffic was generated by 
drivers trying to avoid the signal at Lindero and Kanan Road. 
</P>
<P>
 As a resident of Oak Park who uses the Lindero-Rockfield intersection, I 
object to that statement. Nearly 99% of the vehicles driving through are 
residents who live in the area and have every right to use this intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 We also have a right to do so safely, which is why a traffic signal is badly 
needed and desired. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a safe intersection, but it should not take a body count to prove 
it. Thousand Oaks needs to speed up its plans for installing a signal. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Paul Fredericks, Oak Park 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The city might be willing to install a light sooner if enough residents say it 
is an important project and if the county agrees to help speed up the process, 
Helliwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Lindero-Rockfield intersection borders city and county property, 
three-quarters of the estimated $100,000 to $150,000 cost of installing the 
signal will be paid for by Thousand Oaks and the rest by the county, Helliwell 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the county were willing to put in the light immediately, I'm sure the city 
would not hold it up," Helliwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ventura County Public Works Director Art Goulet says it's up to 
Thousand Oaks to take the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousand Oaks is paying most of the cost, so obviously they're in control," 
Goulet says. "We're ready when they are."

STREET SMART: DESPITE NAME CHANGES, LOMA STREET WILL STRETCH TO ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I read in the paper that there's a proposal to connect Loma Street at the 
Orange-Anaheim border to Loma Street at the Orange-Villa Park border. But the 
1994 Thomas Bros. guide for Orange County says Loma Street is to connect to the 
Mesa Dump Road in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is it? 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Bales Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, both scenarios are correct. Loma Street takes on a couple 
different names, but from stem to stern it starts at the Orange-Villa Park 
border and will eventually extend to the Orange-Anaheim border.  
</P>
<P>
 Beginning at the southern end in the city of Orange, Cannon Street becomes 
Loma Street. Still in Orange, Loma Street continues north along the eastern 
border of Villa Park and becomes Mesa Dump Road. But it doesn't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
 If you'll look closely at your Thomas Bros. guide, you'll see that Mesa Dump 
Road will turn back into Loma Street and go on to connect with Imperial Highway 
in Anaheim. Work to connect Loma Street with Imperial Highway is currently 
underway, said Bernie Dennis, traffic engineer for the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority is holding several public forums 
and hearings on transportation projects. This week, the public is invited to 
two forums to learn about and comment on the Imperial Highway Smart Street 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The first forum will be from 5 to 8 p.m. Wednesday at Imperial Middle School, 
1450 S. Schoolwood Drive, La Habra. The second forum will be from 5 to 8 p.m. 
Thursday at Canyon High School, 220 S. Imperial Highway, Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart Street enhancements include traffic signal coordination, roadway 
widening, raised medians, and bus turnouts. The forums will enable residents 
and business owners to learn more about planned improvements on Imperial 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 While there will not be a formal presentation, information and exhibits 
detailing the project will be available. Also, representatives from OCTA and 
local cities will be available to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA also is soliciting public comment on proposed changes to the transit 
service it offers people with disabilities who cannot access regular buses. 
</P>
<P>
 An annual public hearing will be at 9 a.m. Jan. 10 in the Orange County 
Planning Commission Hearing Room, Hall of Administration, 10 Civic Center 
Plaza, Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 This public hearing will focus on minor service improvements and will raise 
issues to be considered in the next update. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the hearing, OCTA will conduct a two-month public outreach 
campaign during February and March to inform riders and social services 
agencies of the authority's services. 
</P>
<P>
 For additional information, call OCTA at (714) 636-RIDE or at (800) 636-RIDE 
from outlying areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Measure M Citizens Oversight Committee will hold its annual public hearing 
at 6 p.m. Jan. 11 in the Orange County Hall of Administration Planning 
Commission Room at 10 Civic Center Plaza in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will give an overview of Measure M expenditures during the past 
year and an update on the status of Measure M projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The public will have an opportunity to comment and share their ideas regarding 
Measure M projects and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens committee consists of Orange County residents who monitor 
expenditures of Measure M, the half-cent transportation sales tax passed by 
local voters in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, the committee holds a public hearing to determine if provisions of 
the Measure M ordinance are being met by OCTA.

$317,500 SOUGHT FOR GRAND OPENING OF CIVIC ARTS PLAZA; THOUSAND OAKS: 
ORGANIZERS WANT TO LAUNCH THE CITY'S NEW COMPLEX IN STYLE LATER THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From a star-studded, black-tie bash to an informal showcase of local talent, 
the Civic Arts Plaza will open later this year with a gala weekend of 
entertainment -- if the Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday approves a 
$317,500 budget for the kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to create a splashy grand opening, a citizens committee has 
recommended launching the arts complex's 1994 season with a major pop artist, 
followed by the Conejo Symphony performing with a bevy of local choirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Symphony and choral leaders have already settled on their program: the last 
movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, known as the "Ode to Joy." That piece 
seems especially appropriate to longtime backers of the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's perfect because it brings years of work, planning, urging and really 
tough decision-making to a real culmination," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
"(Doubters) said it couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't be done, but it is done. And 
I think it's one of the best things the city has done for itself, or will do 
for itself, in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the grand opening remains 10 months away, more than 200 people have 
joined the committee planning the event, which coincides with Thousand Oaks' 
30th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller 400-seat theater will open first, in September, with performances 
of "Man of La Mancha" and weekly City Council and Planning Commission meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real party will take place the weekend of Oct. 22 when the 1,800-seat 
auditorium opens with an as-yet-undetermined headline act. 
</P>
<P>
 Big-name stars under consideration include David Gaines, who played the lead 
in "Phantom of the Opera"; singer Tony Bennett; jazz artist Mel Torme, and pop 
singer Paul Anka. Organizers also hope to persuade celebrities and prominent 
politicians to join the celebration from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got grandiose plans," theater commissioner Harry Selvin said. "We will 
have first-class talent." 
</P>
<P>
 While ticket prices will depend on the performer, the preliminary budget calls 
for $25 to $75 seats Friday night and $50 to $100 charges for Saturday's 
glittery champagne gala. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers also hope to offer free or discounted seats for senior citizens and 
students interested in attending a Thursday night dress rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 And everyone will get a chance to walk through the Civic Arts Plaza and check 
out local groups during a community talent showcase scheduled the Sunday 
afternoon. Tickets to the amateur performances will cost about $5. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be something for everyone," publicity chairwoman Helene Ross said, 
"not only price-wise, but in terms of the variety of entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand opening budget up for council consideration Tuesday night outlines 
expenditures ranging from $5,000 to create a time capsule to $50,000 for an 
inaugural season brochure listing the year's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 By selling tickets, souvenirs and programs, theater commissioners hope to 
ensure that the grand opening ceremony at least breaks even, and possibly turns 
a profit. Any proceeds would go back into the arts plaza's operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 To maximize income, the commission recently voted not to reduce rent for 
community groups performing during the grand opening. The City Council will 
review that decision Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves, nonprofit groups will pay $400 a day to rent the 
small theater and $1,800 a day for the larger auditorium. Professional troupes 
will pay $800 for the theater and $2,800 for the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rates, comparable to the rental fees charged by similar-size theaters, 
have attracted scores of amateur singers, actors and dancers eager to perform 
in the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The 400-seat theater is already tentatively booked for nearly every weekend 
through May, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Susana Repertory Theatre will present "Man of La Mancha" in 
September, "Christmas Carol" in December, "Driving Miss Daisy" in February, 
1995, and "Little Shop of Horrors" in April, 1995. Other performers include the 
Leisure Village Guild, the California Lutheran University Children's Theater 
and the Conejo Youth Symphony.

WEATHERED WORK OF FOLK ART MAY FACE DEMOLITION; SIMI VALLEY: WHIMSICAL 
COLLECTION OF STRUCTURES MAY BE LEVELED UNLESS SHORED UP. SOME WANT BOTTLE 
VILLAGE SAVED; OTHERS SAY IT'S AN EYESORE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each day, Janice Wilson breezes down a bustling Simi Valley street, past rows 
of cookie-cutter houses, to a ramshackle one-acre fantasy land. 
</P>
<P>
 There, beneath a dozen drooping eucalyptus trees, Wilson tends to a collection 
of miniature trees dripping with toothbrushes, buildings made of bottles, and 
gardens sprouting doll heads and bedsprings. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, Wilson, a custodian at a Simi Valley elementary school, has 
shouldered the awesome task of caring for Bottle Village, a whimsical 
collection of 13 child-sized buildings and sculptures made almost entirely of 
junk. 
</P>
<P>
 To Wilson, the village is an inspiring creation worth preserving. But to many 
of the village's neighbors, it's an eyesore they'd rather see destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-acre village was created by resident Tressa Prisbrey three decades ago 
and has been internationally recognized as a valuable work of folk art. It has 
been closed to the public for 11 years because of unsafe conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Locked behind an iron gate at 4595 Cochran St., roofs leak, walls crumble, and 
the toothbrush trees and doll heads whither and rot at the whim of sun, wind 
and rain. 
</P>
<P>
 There have long been plans to restore the deteriorating structures, but a lack 
of community interest has left the landmark to limp along under the care of a 
few die-hard supporters who call themselves the Preserve Bottle Village 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in order to comply with an ordinance passed several years ago, the 
committee must supply the city with a plan by June to make the village 
earthquake-proof, or face its possible demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much that needs to be done," Wilson said. "What we really need is 
someone who is familiar with how the city works, who can help us work through 
the red tape and organize people who are interested in helping." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the chances of the village being torn down are slim -- 
supporters can always ask for an extension -- but Wilson says the committee 
can't afford to hire an engineer to conduct the study. She said that unless the 
committee can rouse community support, the village will continue to languish. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to boost local interest in the village, Wilson has launched two 
projects: an educational video about the village and a grant-funded reprinting 
of a booklet by Prisbrey, known as "Grandma" Prisbrey, offering a lively 
introduction to the village. 
</P>
<P>
 "A collection of bottles, all shapes and sizes, started to find their way to 
my front yard," Prisbrey wrote. "Putting them together in a heap invited me to 
do something with them . . . thus began Bottle Village." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said she plans to distribute the booklet and video to schools 
throughout the city, with the hope that they will be incorporated into lessons 
on local history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children in particular really love Bottle Village," said Wilson, who said 
Prisbrey's work inspired her to use junk in her own art. "They like the colors 
and all the neat things Grandma collected." 
</P>
<P>
 Prisbrey began building the village around her trailer home in 1955, 
continuing to work on it for almost two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The project began as a simple plan to build a storage space for the 2,000 
pencils she had collected from store giveaways and political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In search of bricks, she visited a dump and discovered a wealth of the Milk of 
Magnesia and beer bottles that were to become the building blocks for the 
entire village. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Pencil House was completed, Prisbrey continued to visit the dump. 
Each day, she filled her Studebaker truck with old tires, headlights and 
television tubes, which wound up as parts of rooms and sculptures with quirky 
names like the Rumpus Room, Cleopatra's Bedroom, the Leaning Tower of Bottle 
Village and the Round House. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottles gave each room a stained-glass, church-like glow as the light 
worked its way through thousands of cobalt-blue and amber bottles. The ceilings 
were covered with swaths of colored fabric, the walls with old posters and 
photographs painted over and decorated with shells, pennies and pine cones. She 
decorated the floors and walkways with tile, stone and glass mosaics one art 
critic dubbed "brickolage." 
</P>
<P>
 Word about Bottle Village spread through the art community, and Prisbrey began 
receiving visitors from around the world. Several sculptures from the village 
toured with museum shows. The village was designated a historic landmark by the 
state and Ventura County, and was awarded a plaque of recognition by the Folk 
Art Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of the village hoped that the accolades would stir up local interest, but 
by Prisbrey's death in 1988 at the age of 92, support had not materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 A local church group has volunteered to mount the plaque commemorating the 
village's state historic landmark status in the next few weeks -- more than 10 
years after the honor was bestowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents are either not interested in Bottle Village or consider it 
kitschy and unattractive, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if people really took the time to come and look at it and think about 
it, they would see beyond the messiness and see the beauty here," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But civic leaders said they doubt that Bottle Village will ever gain the 
support it needs to be fully restored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what this lady did over her lifetime is worth preserving," Councilman 
Bill Davis said. "The problem is dollars and cents, and getting enough interest 
and activity to see it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Mikels said she, too, would like to see the village 
restored, but does not think that there is enough support to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it. That land is potentially valuable, and I don't see anybody 
coming up with the dollars to preserve it," Mikels said. "They may have to 
document it really well and then just save a few pieces as remembrances." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the local newspaper, one resident called for demolition of the 
village, complaining that "anybody who thinks Bottle Village is a work of art 
must have plastic covers on their lamp shades, red shag carpets and Cheez Whiz 
for brains." 
</P>
<P>
 But Seymour Rosen, director of the Los Angeles-based group Saving and 
Preserving Art and Cultural Environments (SPACES), said the disdain for Bottle 
Village comes from a lack of understanding of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some, there is no value to art, to religion, to spirit, but to those who 
value any of these, the preservation of Bottle Village is essential," Rosen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In building it, Grandma has made tangible the kind of spirit that allows 
people to go ahead with a dream, to create," he said. "It's an incredible 
monument to the human spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen likened the village to Los Angeles' Watts Towers, a series of 
cone-shaped towers made with bits of bottles, pottery, shells and iron held 
together with chicken wire and cement. 
</P>
<P>
 Built over three decades by unschooled Italian immigrant Simon Rodia, the 
towers, which once faced demolition, are now undergoing an extensive renovation 
and have become a popular tourist and artistic attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes commitment and recognition that something is worthwhile in order to 
save it," Rosen said.

2 SISTERS LEFT WITH ANGUISH OVER FAMILY'S DISAPPEARANCE; MISSING: KATHLEEN AND 
CHRISTINA HARRISON STILL HOPE THAT SOMEONE WILL FIND THE AIRCRAFT CARRYING 
THEIR PARENTS AND SIBLING. 
</P>

<P>
 Months after the disappearance of their parents and sister, Kathleen and 
Christina Harrison still alternate between hoping for a miracle and grieving 
over a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what not knowing does, the Thousand Oaks sisters said. The mystery 
torments. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen, 24, and Christina, 25, have been left wondering since July 25 when 
the single-engine plane piloted by their father, Reed Harrison, failed to 
arrive at Camarillo Airport as scheduled from Utah. Their mother, Judy, and 
18-year-old sister, Julie, were aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a funeral service; there aren't graves to go visit," Christina 
said during a recent interview in the family's North Ranch home. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not even anything to tell us they crashed; nothing has told us 
they're not alive," said Kathleen, pausing to add, "Except they're not here. 
It's like they vanished." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite more than two weeks of searching in four states by the Civil Air 
Patrol, no sign of the aircraft was ever found. But the sisters could not stop 
looking even after authorities halted the official hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident we will never entirely give up until we find them," said 
Kathleen, who works for an insurance brokerage firm in the Westlake area of 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pilots keep in contact with the sisters and continue to look for wreckage 
from the plane when they fly over the area between Camarillo and Roosevelt, 
Utah, Kathleen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters said they hope that other fliers will similarly keep a lookout for 
the brown and beige Beechcraft Bonanza plane. They are now trying to arrange an 
airing of their story on the popular syndicated television show "Unsolved 
Mysteries," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have any closure until we know what happened, and we don't know much 
more today than we did on the 25th of July," said Christina, a law student at 
the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. "The only thing we know for sure is 
they left." 
</P>
<P>
 "And they never came home," Kathleen added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrison plane disappeared from radar screens after passing over a 
mountainous area near Price, Utah, about 60 miles southwest of Roosevelt, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few months ago, Kathleen said she satisfied her curiosity about the 
area by driving around there with Christina and scanning the landscape from the 
ridge tops. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, we thought, 'Why can't they find them?' " Kathleen said. 
"Then we did some searching of our own, and it's so dense and so rugged. You 
understand once you go there." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, they sent informational flyers to hunting license offices in Utah, 
hoping outdoorsmen would remember to look. But hunting season came and went 
without a word, Christina said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really thought someone would find them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks after the plane's disappearance, friends and family rallied 
around Kathleen and Christina. The sisters also received cards and letters from 
strangers who wrote that Reed, Judy or Julie had touched their lives, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An 80-year-old woman wrote that Reed, an attorney and former Thousand Oaks 
planning commissioner, had been checking up on her regularly since the recent 
death of her husband. Judy, a counselor at El Camino Real High School in 
Woodland Hills, had brought her meals, the woman wrote to the sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Julie, who was last year's senior class president at Westlake High 
School, helped hand out leaflets seeking information about the missing family, 
the sisters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's comforting to know there are so many people out there who care," 
Christina said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters called press conferences to keep the item in the news and handed 
out "missing" flyers to hikers in desert and mountain areas of southern Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Their spirits rose and fell as the days passed. At one point, they got word 
that the plane had been found with no survivors. It turned out to be a 
different crash, which had occurred nine years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the search was called off after volunteer Civil Air Patrol pilots 
looked for 18 days without finding a clue. The sisters thought that it was too 
soon to stop. They feared the worst: that their family had survived a crash, 
but would die waiting for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if we find them and they had made a camp and they starved to death?" 
Kathleen said, fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "The not knowing is horrible," Christina said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the U.S. Air Force calls off a Civil Air Patrol search without results, 
it's one of the hardest messages to deliver to a family, said Pat Morley, a 
Woodland Hills resident who helped look for the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's even harder than saying, 'We found them but they're not alive,' 
" Morley said, "because it still leaves the family up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed Harrison did not file a flight plan detailing the route he would take 
home that day, said retired U. S. Army Lt. Col. Bob Fowler, a Civil Air Patrol 
spokesman. That is not unusual, but it made the search more difficult, Fowler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer patrols searched longer for the Harrisons than is typical 
because Reed, an Army veteran of Vietnam, was well-trained in survival skills, 
Morley said. As days and weeks passed, however, hopefulness turned to despair. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he were in a conscious state and able to survive even a few days, I'm sure 
he would have used smoke, a mirror, anything to show us evidence there is life 
here," Morley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force, not the volunteer fliers with the Civil Air Patrol, decides 
when to call off the search, Fowler said. After 18 days, the odds are against 
finding survivors, he concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds after 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours diminish as it goes," Fowler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen and Christina said they know the probability of what happened but 
can't resist hoping. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe in miracles," Kathleen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll always want to bring them home, but we're realistic about what probably 
happened," Christina said. "We just don't want people to forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the truth would help the sisters finally close the door on the past, 
Christina said. But it wouldn't end the pain, Kathleen added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting for this to be over, but it's never going to be over," Kathleen 
said. "We've lost our family."

OVERSIGHT MORE THAN DOUBLES COST OF BRIDGE OVER FREEWAY; TRANSPORTATION: DUE TO 
OVERLOOKED STATE MANDATES, KIMBALL ROAD OVERPASS IS BEING REBUILT RATHER THAN 
WIDENED. PRICE TAG SKYROCKETS TO NEARLY $12 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of a design oversight, a project to widen Kimball Road over the Santa 
Paula Freeway will cost the city of Ventura $6.5 million more than originally 
estimated, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project -- which will end up costing nearly $12 million -- was supposed to 
be entirely funded by four developers, but about $4.6 million will come from 
taxpayers, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time the agreements were struck with developers in January, 1988, the 
City Council, the developers and city staff members thought that the project 
would only entail widening the existing Kimball Road bridge. Instead, they 
discovered later that state mandates called for the bridge to be raised or 
rebuilt, said Everett Millais, the city's community development director. 
</P>
<P>
 That oversight -- which was pointed out in a September, 1989, city report -- 
added millions to the project's price tag. By the time the mistake was 
discovered, contracts based on a $5.5-million estimate had already been signed 
with the four developers, Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for being allowed to build 721 houses north of Juanamaria School, 
the developers were required to pay for all the highway and road improvements, 
Millais said. Developers agreed to pay $7.4 million to the city, which 
officials thought would cover the costs of the road project. 
</P>
<P>
 Because pro-growth members of the City Council were eager to approve the 
development, the contracts with the four developers were approved too hastily, 
Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreements should not have been finalized until we got through a 
preliminary review with Caltrans," Millais acknowledged. "That's hindsight, and 
we're going to learn from that. We're not going to do that again." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the project in excess of the $7.4 million contribution from 
developers will be paid for with gas tax funds, a state grant and traffic 
mitigation fees from other development projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The project -- one of the largest road construction jobs in city history -- 
entails demolishing the existing bridge on Kimball and building a new bridge 
just west of it. 
</P>
<P>
 he new bridge will be about three times as wide. Kimball Road will be widened 
to six lanes between Telegraph Road and Thille Street. New traffic signals and 
taller sound walls will also be erected. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction officials estimate that the work -- which began in August -- will 
be completed in a year. Project engineer Mike McMillen said he has not 
encountered any major problems during the construction so far, and expects it 
to be finished on time and within budget. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no lack of finger-pointing for the $6.5-million design oversight. The 
developers say they are not at fault because they did not make the project cost 
estimates -- the city did. Former council members blame each other and city 
staff members. City staff members said state Department of Transportation 
officials are partly responsible. Caltrans officials say they were involved in 
the negotiations with developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we would be covering the costs," said Ron Hertel, whose 
development company has built 83 houses in the project so far. "The city hadn't 
done a comprehensive study on it. I know they weren't happy with the surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Former council members who opposed the development agreements for the Kimball 
bridge project said they had anticipated that the cost would rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was obvious that the bridge would cost more than the original 
estimates," former Mayor Richard Francis said. "It's very dangerous when you 
cut deals with developers -- you tend to give away the public purse." 
</P>
<P>
 Francis said he had argued unsuccessfully for the four developers to be held 
responsible for the entire cost of the project, instead of imposing a fee of 
$10,000 per house that city officials assumed would cover the whole bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had had my way, the document would have read, 'The developers will pay 
for all costs,' " said Francis, a civil litigation attorney. "If that had been 
the case, being private business people, they would have been more careful to 
estimate the true costs. Government does business badly. It's important to keep 
the profits and risks in the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
 Francis and former Councilman Don Villeneuve fault the pro-growth council in 
1988 for approving the development agreements with insufficient review. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a really pro-business council, they'll buy anything," 
Villeneuve said. "It was absolutely irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 But council members who approved the project blame city staff members and 
Caltrans for not giving them accurate information at the time the development 
agreements were negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got some bad advice," Councilman Jim Monahan said. "Staff should have 
looked into it. We were never informed that there was anything that would cause 
the costs to escalate out of sight." 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members are reproaching Caltrans officials, who they say did not 
let them know about the height requirements until after the project was under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out we would have to jack up the bridge, and it became cheaper to 
build a new bridge," City Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani said. "Caltrans did not 
make this apparent until we were far into the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said they were surprised to hear about the city's 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a situation where they were going by the old standards. The 
standards keep getting upgraded," said Cindy Quon, Caltrans' chief of project 
development in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. "We are not aware of any 
differences or concerns from the city about the scope of the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $7.4 million that the developers are obligated to pay, about $5.6 
million has been submitted. The remaining $1.8 million will be paid in 
increments as the four developers apply for building permits. But those fees 
will trickle in slowly because the developers have had trouble selling the 
houses since the recession began. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers -- Ron Hertel, Meeker Land & Development, Cherrie Construction 
and Hammer-Hewson Associates -- all said the recession has slowed or halted 
their sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilwoman Cathy Bean, who opposed the project before her term on the 
council, said the road widening is unnecessary because the development is not 
finished and not enough residents have moved into the area yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is absolutely not needed," Bean said. "I live by it. I use it every day. 
It wasn't an overburdened overpass." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 721 houses scheduled to be built, only 145 homes have been constructed. 
But the developers said the housing project -- which is expected to bring in 
more than 2,000 residents to the area -- will need an improved road and bridge 
when building is eventually finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the housing market, it could be another four years before the 
project is done, said Gene Cherrie, owner of Ventura-based Cherrie 
Construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan, who thinks that the developers were assessed too much for the road 
project, said it is appropriate that the taxpayers help fund construction of 
the new bridge and road widening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have the benefit of using that street," Monahan said. "Some way or 
another, we always end up paying for it."

CONVICTED MAN TO BE TRIED IN WOMAN'S 1992 OXNARD SLAYING; CRIME: TRIAL 
INVOLVING CHRISTOPHER JAMES SATTIEWHITE IS THE FIRST CAPITAL PUNISHMENT CASE IN 
VENTURA COUNTY IN MORE THAN TWO YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Jan. 27, 1992, two fishermen walking along Arnold Road in Oxnard happened 
upon the partly clothed body of 30-year-old Genoveva Gonzales in a drainage 
ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard woman had two bullet wounds to the forehead and one to the cheek. 
An autopsy revealed that she had been raped and shot at point-blank range the 
night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, nearly two full years later, a convicted felon who is already serving a 
21-year prison sentence for rape and robbery in a separate case in Oxnard is 
scheduled to go on trial in Ventura County Superior Court in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher James Sattiewhite was indicted 13 months after the slaying when an 
acquaintance told police that he had seen the defendant shoot Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial -- which is expected to last at least nine weeks -- will be the 
first death penalty case tried in the county in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Ventura County death penalty trial was for former day-care aide 
Gregory Scott Smith. He was tried in October, 1991, for killing 8-year-old Paul 
Bailly of Northridge and burning the boy's body beyond recognition. A jury sent 
Smith to Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have said the Gonzales case is one of the most senseless killings 
in the area in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Sattiewhite and another man kidnaped Gonzales -- described by 
police as a mother of four with a history of drug convictions -- for rape. When 
Sattiewhite inadvertently called out the second man's name, they agreed that 
Sattiewhite would shoot and kill her, lest she identify them, prosecutors have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for both sides in the Sattiewhite case declined to be interviewed 
for this story, but a preview of their arguments can be gleaned from court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 As is typical in death penalty cases, defense attorneys have not spent much 
time disputing the evidence against their client in pretrial hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, their strategy has been to focus on Sattiewhite's mental competency. 
For example, Judge Lawrence Storch in August appointed a psychologist to 
evaluate Sattiewhite after attorney Willard Wiksell claimed that the man has 
brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a psychologist concluded that Sattiewhite understands the charges 
against him, can operate in a rational manner and does not demonstrate signs of 
mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have also disputed the claims of mental illness, noting that 
Sattiewhite is a high school graduate and has held a number of odd jobs 
throughout Ventura County. They contend that he killed during the commission of 
a rape and kidnaping and, under California law, should be put to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution's main witness will be a 23-year-old convicted felon named 
Bobby Rollins, a friend of Sattiewhite at the time of Gonzales' slaying. 
Rollins was convicted last year of rape and robbery along with Sattiewhite in 
an Oxnard Beach case. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins has told investigators that on the night of the 1992 Super Bowl, he 
saw Sattiewhite hold a .32-caliber handgun to Gonzales' head and fire three 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins had faced a possible sentence of more than 50 years in the beach case. 
But prosecutors agreed to seek no more than 20 years on the condition that 
Rollins plead guilty and testify against Sattiewhite in the Gonzales case, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking the indictment against Sattiewhite, prosecutors had Rollins testify 
before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins told the panel that he was driving along Oxnard Boulevard late Jan. 
26, 1992, when he stopped to talk with Sattiewhite near a hamburger eatery. 
</P>
<P>
 He said they went around the corner to a nearby alley, where Sattiewhite's 
Cadillac was parked. Another man was in the rear of the car, as was Gonzales, 
he told the grand jury. Gonzales appeared to be struggling with the man. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he got back into his own car and followed the Cadillac and its 
occupants to some apartments on West 5th Avenue. At the apartments, Sattiewhite 
pulled the Cadillac into a carport. Rollins said he could see the man in the 
back was raping Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 During the rape, the man punched Gonzales in the face with a closed fist 
several times, and she reacted by spitting on the man, testified Rollins, who 
said he did not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins said he was told by Sattiewhite that the woman had been "gaffled," or 
kidnaped off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The man in the back seat is serving prison time in an unrelated case and is 
still under investigation in the Gonzales matter, authorities have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins left the apartments but agreed to meet Sattiewhite an hour later to 
drink beer at a field off Arnold Road. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived, Rollins testified, the man in the back seat was pushing an 
unconscious-looking Gonzales out of the Cadillac. He said Sattiewhite caught 
her before she hit the ground and dragged her to the drainage ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when he saw Sattiewhite pump three bullets into the woman, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Sattiewhite is found guilty, the jury would decide whether he deserves to 
be put to death. 
</P>
<P>
 If the case proceeds to this phase, prosecutors plan to tell the jury that 
Sattiewhite was sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to the rape and 
robbery of another Oxnard woman who was accosted as she and her boyfriend sat 
on Oxnard Beach. That incident occurred in September, 1992, eight months after 
Gonzales' slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth of 10 children, Sattiewhite was born in Oxnard on Aug. 31, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother was a homemaker and his father a psychiatric technician at 
Camarillo State Hospital and a minister. The father left the family when 
Sattiewhite was still young, court records say, although they don't say how old 
Sattiewhite was at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was devastated by his father's disappearance and the abandonment it 
meant," court-appointed psychologist Kathryn M. Davis wrote in her report. "He 
describes his problems as beginning shortly thereafter." 
</P>
<P>
 Sattiewhite, through his attorneys, declined to be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing high school in 1987, Sattiewhite jumped from one odd job to 
another. He was a busboy, cook and box boy, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the psychologist that he couldn't keep jobs because he lacked 
transportation and "got involved with the wrong people and with drugs and 
alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
 He denied involvement with cocaine, but said he used some acid and PCP. 
Describing the effects of the drugs, he said: "You see things that are not 
there and do things you otherwise wouldn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sattiewhite understands the charges against him, he feels 
overwhelmed, according to Davis' report. 
</P>
<P>
 "He describes the experience of agitation and depression. He has had thoughts 
of killing himself. His emotions and thoughts are fragmented," it said. "If the 
profile is valid . . . the current level of distress could be characterized as 
psychotic." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection in the case is expected to begin today and continue for about 
three weeks.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VOLUNTEERS HOLD BIRD COUNT IN VENTURA ESTUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walking outside a restricted portion of McGrath State Beach stained by a 
Christmas Day oil spill, local members of the Audubon Society on Sunday counted 
and catalogued birds in the Ventura estuary as part of an annual survey to 
determine where America's birds live and whether various species are thriving 
or becoming extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 The estuary, where the Santa Clara River meets the Pacific Ocean, is a 
biologically rich area often teeming with birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the better, if not the best places to spot shorebirds on the 
coast," said Bob Hefter, an electrician and the Audubon volunteer coordinating 
the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefter and one other volunteer were part of a countywide effort in recent 
weeks to complete Audubon's annual "Christmas Count." Each year in more than 
1,600 cities and counties throughout the country, more than 40,000 Audubon 
members conduct the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong tradition started in Ventura County in the early 1970s. A few 
years ago, local birders identified 179 species and counted nearly 28,000 
birds, all in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
 The work requires experienced and dedicated volunteers. The two men working at 
the estuary were up before dawn, along with about 60 volunteers working in 
other parts of western Ventura County. The Conejo Valley chapter of the Audubon 
Society did an east county count before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 As the two volunteers moved closer to the oil spill site, they came within 
earshot of crews using the pop of a small cannon to scare away birds from the 
oil-soaked area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem like anyone knows how bad the spill really is," Bart Lane, a 
recently retired mathematician at Point Mugu weapons station, said as he looked 
for more birds. "It's pretty disappointing with a disaster like this to find 
out that warnings were ignored and that it spilled for three days without 
anyone knowing about it." 
</P>
<P>
 As Lane and Hefter moved along the north side of the estuary, the morning sun 
still hadn't crested the top branches of the willow trees surrounding them. It 
was still early, and the two had already catalogued 67 species of birds. But 
still they were disappointed. "It's tough with just two people doing the 
spotting; you miss things," Hefter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he said they identified more than 100 species, including 15 
different species of ducks in ponds created by the Ventura County Sanitation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 As they walked near the ponds Sunday, a few coots flapped across the water. 
Mounting a telescope on a tripod, Hefter carefully scanned the reeds on the 
other bank and picked out a cinnamon teal duck swimming slowing away into the 
dissipating morning mist. 
</P>
<P>
 As the duck turned, the sun caught the brilliant emerald-green feathers that 
are combed back behind its eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got into this because of the color," Lane said. "If I could do this all the 
time, I would." SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; CAMROSA REPLACING FAULTY WATER PIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Camrosa Water District officials said they are proceeding with a program to 
replace faulty plastic pipes that connect residential users to street-side 
water mains. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipes, known as laterals, have been shattering or bursting prematurely, 
Chris Smith, Camrosa's manager of engineering services, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the 2,600 of these laterals that we originally installed, we have about 
1,600 left to replace," Smith said. "They advertised that the equipment would 
last 25 years, and it hasn't even come close." 
</P>
<P>
 The pipes were installed in the district from 1976 to 1983. Camrosa's 
replacement effort began about two years ago. The water utility, which serves 
about 8,000 residences in Camarillo and the Santa Rosa Valley, is replacing the 
laterals at a rate of about 800 a year, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura-based Sam Hill Construction, the company selected to do the 
replacement job, is replacing the plastic pipe with copper tubing in a 
procedure that requires a resident's water to be turned off for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said construction crews are working on replacing the faulty connectors 
in Camarillo's east side. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district is paying for the new installation with funds generated 
from a settlement with the plastic pipe maker, a subsidiary of Shell Oil Co. 
Smith said he did not know exactly why the piping is faulty. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said work is being timed to coincide with the city's street repaving 
effort to avoid tearing up freshly laid asphalt. J. E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GRANTS TO HELP BOOST OIL RECYCLING PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three cities and Ventura County have received state grants to promote motor 
oil recycling programs and other hazardous waste reduction plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, which runs the county's most comprehensive oil recycling 
program, received the biggest grant: $34,000 from the California Integrated 
Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will split a $31,000 grant with the city of Ojai. Camarillo won a 
$17,000 award, and Moorpark received nearly $8,500. "You'll see centers for 
recycling oil popping up everywhere very shortly," predicted Grahame Watts, 
Thousand Oaks' recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, which will use the grant mainly for public education, has 
collected 50,000 gallons of used motor oil in the last three years through its 
twice-monthly collection drives, Watts said. The city-sponsored recycling 
center is open the first Thursday and third Saturday of every month at the new 
municipal service yard on Rancho Conejo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling experts in Moorpark and Camarillo said they would use the grants to 
promote certified drop-off points in or near their cities and to develop 
educational material. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Integrated Waste Management Board can certify local service 
stations as official motor oil recycling sites. Once certified, the stations 
can collect used motor oil and offer a 4-cent rebate for every quart that 
customers bring in to recycle. STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GUILIN TO AGAIN HEAD STATE AVOCADO BOARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alfonso A. Guilin of Santa Paula has been reelected chairman of the Board of 
Directors of the California Avocado Commission, a statewide organization that 
advertises and promotes the consumption of avocados. 
</P>
<P>
 Guilin was reelected by the board's other members to serve as chairman for 
1993-94, commission spokeswoman Kari Bretschger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer position is mostly ceremonial. As chairman, Guilin is charged 
with running the 15-member board's meetings and is only permitted to vote in 
the event of a tie, Bretschger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guilin is executive vice president of the Limoneira Co. of Santa Paula, where 
he has worked for 27 years. He has served on the avocado commission's board for 
seven years, Bretschger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which includes both independent and cooperative growers, also 
elected Sam McIntyre of Somis vice chairman of the commission, Al Snider of 
Fallbrook treasurer and Ron Wild of Vista secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission was created by the California Legislature in 1978, replacing 
the 16-year-old California Avocado Advisory Board. The Santa Ana-based 
commission, which represents the state's 6,000 avocado growers, is funded by 
grower assessments, Bretschger said. CARLOS V. LOZANO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; RESORT TO THREATEN BIRDS, BIOLOGIST 
SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A university biologist hired by critics of a proposed recreational vehicle 
resort in Port Hueneme has concluded that the project would threaten rare sand 
dunes and the endangered birds living and foraging on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3,500 report by Pat Herron Baird, an ornithologist with Cal State Long 
Beach, was commissioned by the local chapter of the Sierra Club and residents 
of the Surfside III condominiums, who have opposed the resort. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Baird's study, researchers found endangered birds visiting or 
feeding on the 10-acre site in April and May. They also believe that a pair of 
snowy plovers nest there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a net loss of habitat and with this net loss will come loss of 
individual members of" endangered species, including the California least tern, 
snowy plovers and Belding's Savannah sparrows, Baird stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Sanders, president of the local Sierra Club, said Baird's study would 
help state regulators understand the importance of the proposed RV resort site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the key agency people have known all along that the city's version of 
the impacts of the project on biological resources was not accurately stated," 
Sanders said. "However, these people are not in a position to come down and do 
their own investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager John R. Velthoen responded to the report Thursday, saying the 
study contained only indirect evidence that the snowy plover actually nests on 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a wetland," Velthoen said of the proposed site. "It would be 
incredible to believe that any animals are breeding on the site because it is 
so disturbed by human activity." PATRICK McCARTNEY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY REJECTS OFFER TO BUY SITE FOR MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks after buying 32 acres of prime hillside property once planned for a 
Wal-Mart, the city of Simi Valley has decided not to buy two neighboring 
parcels zoned for a regional mall. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter received by the city last week, Mitchell Realtors offered to sell 
the city 80 acres of undeveloped land for about $8.8 million, which works out 
to the same per-square-foot price that the city is paying for the neighboring 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a letter sent in response, City Manager Lin Koester rejected the offer, 
saying "acquisition of the property is not imperative at this point in time." 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-December, the city agreed to pay $3.5 million for an adjacent 32-acre 
parcel, part of the Lucile Estes Estate. The property was owned by Estes' 
husband, former City Councilman Bill Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the city's land-use plan, part of that property could be used to 
build a road required for construction of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 At Koester's urging, City Council members approved the purchase, saying they 
hoped that city ownership would entice a mall developer to build on the 
property by eliminating the hassle of negotiating for the roadway site. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to criticism that the deal was being rushed, Koester said new state 
legislation regulating community development agencies would outlaw the purchase 
if it were not made by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter rejecting the offer to sell the city the 80 acres, Koester said 
there was no immediate need for the city to buy the property because the 
adjoining parcel was enough incentive for mall developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The landowners still have the option of selling the property directly to a 
mall developer. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY, DEVELOPER REMAIN AT ODDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three months after agreeing to binding arbitration to resolve a payment 
dispute, the city of Thousand Oaks and a developer of the Dos Vientos housing 
project have still not selected an arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The disagreement centers on an $806,000 payment that developer Courtly Homes 
was supposed to pay the city in mid-June.That money was due under a development 
agreement that guaranteed Courtly Homes as well as Operating Engineers the 
right to build up to 2,350 homes on Dos Vientos Ranch in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 When Courtly Homes failed to come up with the payment by October, the City 
Council voted to declare a breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But the developer's attorney, Chuck Cohen, argued that Courtly Homes had a 
right to request an amended payment schedule because the sagging economy 
presented an insurmountable obstacle to raising the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The development agreement provides for relaxing either party's obligations in 
case of an "act of God," such as an earthquake, flood or war. Cohen argued that 
the stagnant real estate market falls in that category. 
</P>
<P>
 To resolve their differences, both sides consented to binding arbitration. So 
far, though, they have made little progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Picking an arbitrator is sometimes the most difficult part of the process," 
City Atty. Mark Sellers said. "We're still talking about a number of issues, 
which I can't disclose." 
</P>
<P>
 Courtly Homes will not owe the city any additional payments until the 
developer starts building on Dos Vientos, Sellers said. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COUPLE HOSPITALIZED AFTER CAR ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Nevada couple remained hospitalized Sunday after the car they were traveling 
in tumbled off a steep embankment on Grimes Canyon Road near Moorpark late 
Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car that Melissa Tibbetts, 18, and Daniel Thorton, 19, were in went off 
the road near Shekell Road about 9:20 p.m., according to Ventura County 
Sheriff's Sgt. Terry Hughes.Officials believe that the car dropped 200 to 300 
feet below the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said Ventura County firefighters had to rescue Tibbetts, who suffered 
several broken bones, after she became trapped inside the car. Thorton, who 
suffered minor internal injuries, managed to free himself and flag down a 
passing motorist. 
</P>
<P>
 They were taken to Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, where 
Tibbetts was listed in fair condition and Thorton was listed in stable 
condition as of Sunday afternoon, according to a nursing supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said the sheriff's major crimes unit and the California Highway Patrol 
were investigating the accident. He declined to give more details. A CHP 
spokeswoman also declined comment on the case. J. E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; APPROVAL LIKELY FOR AUTO DEALERS' 
SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Round 3 of the great Thousand Oaks Auto Mall sign debate is scheduled for 
Tuesday's City Council meeting -- but this time, the outcome is nearly certain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Auto Mall dealers have come up with a design that fits the criteria the 
council outlined in approving a new sign last month.In that 3-2 vote, the 
council agreed to allow a sign 20 feet high, with a small electronic board 
indicating time and temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the new blueprints conform to those standards, the council has no 
choice but to grant permission for the sign, Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sticking to exactly what they asked for," said Susan Mejia, treasurer 
of the Auto Mall Assn. "I don't think it's tall enough, and having a bigger 
message board would draw more attention, but what are we going to do? Something 
is better than nothing, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 The new design retains the stucco pillars and back-lit metal globe of the Auto 
Mall's first proposal, which was rejected as too tall and garish. Although the 
tip of the globe pokes up 21 feet high, the rest of the sign stands at 19 feet, 
Mejia said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lazar's recommendation, the Auto Mall Assn. has added a brass plaque to the 
sign, advertising that the mall houses 36 dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new sign will be placed roughly in the same location as the present wooden 
monument, fulfilling another council requirement, Mejia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to review the design shortly after 5 p.m. Tuesday.

BETTIS CARRIES RAMS PAST THE BEARS, 20-6; PRO FOOTBALL: HIS 39 RUSHES BREAK 
DICKERSON'S TEAM RECORD AND PRODUCE 146 YARDS AS LOS ANGELES FINISHES 5-11. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Rams stopped the Chicago Bears, 20-6, but party hard as they did after 
finishing 5-11 Sunday, they dropped from second to fifth in the NFL draft, 
thereby hurting their chances of landing a quality quarterback next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Bettis ran a team-record 39 times and gained 146 yards before 39,147 at 
Anaheim Stadium, but he fell 58 yards shy of passing Dallas' Emmitt Smith for 
the NFL rushing title. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith had 168 yards in an overtime victory against the New York Giants in 
Sunday's early game to earn his third-consecutive rushing title with 1,486 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis broke Eric Dickerson's 1986 Ram record of 38 rushes against the St. 
Louis Cardinals on the final play of the game after Coach Chuck Knox called for 
a timeout with five seconds remaining. Bettis lost one yard on the 
record-breaking carry, but finished the season with 1,429 yards -- fourth best 
in Ram history behind Dickerson's 2,105 in 1984, 1,821 yards in 1986 and 1,808 
yards in 1983. It was also the seventh-best rushing season by an NFL rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some confusion down the sideline as to how many carries he needed 
to get the record that Dickerson had," Knox said. "I didn't have any problem 
with (calling a timeout). I felt he deserved the record the way he had run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this guy is as good as any running back that I have ever had. That's 
31 years of coaching, and that says a lot for a lot of backs. He brings the 
best he has to the ballpark every Sunday, and he's in the locker room now 
thanking the defense for giving him the number of opportunities he had today. 
He didn't get the rushing title, but he's still thanking the defense . . . 
that's the kind of guy he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, the 10th pick in last year's draft, has been selected to play in the 
Pro Bowl and probably will be voted NFL rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big players play big games and Emmitt showed that by having a big game and 
putting a lot of pressure on me," said Bettis, who didn't start four of the 
team's first five games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me before the game I was going to probably have to have a 200-yard 
day to catch him, but I'm not disappointed by what happened because I think 
I've done a lot of good things for this team." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to running for more than 100 yards for the seventh time this 
season, Bettis ran for a four-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter and caught a 
season-high five passes for 71 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if he could just throw the ball, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can throw a little bit; I can get it down the field," Bettis said with a 
grin. "But I don't think they are ready for that part yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory might have cost the Rams an opportunity to select Fresno State's 
Trent Dilfer or Tennessee's Heath Shuler, who are expected to be the two top 
quarterbacks in this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
 As juniors, both players must declare themselves eligible for the draft before 
Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we need somebody who can throw the ball because you just can't run 
it all the time," Ram tackle Irv Eatman said. "But when you do have somebody 
like Jerome, it sure takes a lot of pressure off whoever you have at 
quarterback back there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram management has talked privately about moving on next season without 
quarterback Jim Everett, who did not play in the final four games. T.J. Rubley, 
who completed 18 of 28 passes for 213 yards in his seventh start, is being 
projected as a backup next season by club officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Bengals have a young quarterback and will select first in the 
draft, and have already expressed an interest in San Diego State running back 
Marshall Faulk. Indianapolis will select second, Washington third, New England 
fourth and then the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't playing for a draft choice today," Ram safety Anthony Newman said. 
"We were playing to win. We are professional athletes, and we went out there to 
get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams held the NFL's No. 28-ranked offense to 163 yards. The Bears were one 
for nine in third-down opportunities, had only 74 net passing yards against the 
NFL's 27th-ranked passing defense and averaged 3.1 yards per pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams took a 6-0 lead on two 29-yard field goals by Tony Zendejas, and held 
on for a 6-3 halftime lead after Kevin Butler's 27-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams failed to score in the third quarter, but the Rams took a 13-3 lead 
on the second play of the fourth quarter with Rubley throwing an 11-yard 
touchdown pass to rookie tight end Troy Drayton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed their defensive end (Trace Armstrong) kept coming up the field to 
get the quarterback, so I told the coaches and they called the play," said 
Drayton, who finished with five catches for 49 yards. "I hit Armstrong, 
released and I was wide open for the touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears removed quarterback Jim Harbaugh from the game in the fourth quarter 
after he had completed nine consecutive passes. Harbaugh finished nine for 10 
for 62 yards, and was replaced by Peter Tom Willis, who completed four of 11 
for 33 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just trying to do something to find a spark," Bear Coach Dave 
Wannstedt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler brought the Bears within a touchdown with 8:20 remaining on a 53-yard 
field goal, but the Rams drove 78 yards, capped by Bettis' four-yard run off 
right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring, Bettis ripped off his helmet, pounded his chest and began 
screaming at the fans in the end zone seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was gyrating," Bettis said. "I was just so happy and proud of the guys and 
what they had done and I wanted everyone to know about it. I wanted to show my 
appreciation by going crazy."

RAM NOTEBOOK; FANS USE EMPTY SEATS TO SHOW THEIR DISPLEASURE

 The Rams finished the season with their fans -- the few in attendance -- 
standing and applauding a 20-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a good year, however, to sell Ram tickets. The Rams averaged 45,401 
fans per home game, an all-time low since their arrival at Anaheim Stadium in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams drew 39,147 fans to their regular-season finale Sunday and ran their 
eight-game home season attendance to 363,211. 
</P>
<P>
 The team averaged 47,810 fans a game last season, and a high of 62,550 in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams said there were 8,991 no-shows Sunday, which represented a season 
high. According to team statistics, 45,353 tickets -- an average of 5,669 per 
game -- were not used this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the season began, Coach Chuck Knox looked at his team, their opponents 
and their combined 103-105 record and then predicted the playoffs were within 
reach. Oh well. 
</P>
<P>
 Next season, the Rams will try again against a group of opponents with a 
combined record of 105-102 (49ers finish the season tonight against 
Philadelphia). 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will play at home against the Broncos, Raiders, Giants, Redskins and 
Eagles, unless Philadelphia defeats the 49ers. If so, the Cardinals will play 
in Anaheim Stadium instead of the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their home-and-away schedule against the 49ers, Falcons and 
Saints, the Rams will travel to Kansas City, San Diego, Green Bay, Chicago and 
Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1994 Draft: 1. Cincinnati, 2. Indianapolis, 3. Washington, 4. New England, 5. 
Rams, 6. Tampa Bay, 7. Atlanta, 8. Seattle, 9. Cleveland, 10. Phoenix.

 Going, going, gone? Pat Terrell's fourth-quarter interception might have been 
his last as a Ram. A strong safety from Notre Dame, Terrell will be an 
unrestricted free agent at the end of the season, and he was disappointed the 
Rams didn't try sign him by the Dec. 23 early signing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to go out and test the free-agent market," Terrell said. "My agent, 
Leigh Steinberg, is going to do what he has to. But hopefully, I'll be back 
here in Southern California again. I've been through the rough times, and I 
know that I'm a good safety and I have a lot of good football left in me. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you do speaks so well, and I have some good game films. Hopefully, the 
Rams will see what they have in Pat Terrell during the off-season." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Missing his mark: Wide receiver Henry Ellard failed to achieve his goal of 
1,000 receiving yards, getting only one catch for 24 yards. Ellard needed 79 
yards to reach 1,000-yard mark for the fifth time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ellard isn't bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big goal for me, definitely," Ellard said. "But we were trying to 
get Jerome the rushing title, so it was something that happened. It's just the 
way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't mind taking a backseat to do that." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Glad it's over: During six seasons with the Buffalo Bills, middle linebacker 
Shane Conlan was usually preparing for the playoffs this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday after completing his first season with the Rams, Conlan was sorting out 
his thoughts on the team's 5-11 season. It was the first losing team Conlan has 
played for since the Bills went 7-8 in 1987, his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so good to win the last game because you have a good feeling coming 
back," Conlan said. "After losing the last three Super Bowls with the Bills, we 
came into training camp the next year with a (lousy) taste in our mouth. The 
off-season is longer, and you always wonder, 'Could I have done this, could I 
have done that?' When you win, everything is easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we didn't have the season we wanted, but it's good to go out on a 
winning note." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stat of the day: Jerome Bettis' 146 yards rushing made him only the second 
player in the past 24 games to run for more than 100 yards against a Dave 
Wannstedt coached defense, dating back to last season, when Wannstedt was 
Dallas' defensive coordinator. The other player to break the 100-yard mark was 
Denver's Rod Bernstine, who had 103 yards two weeks ago against the Bears.

SANTA ANITA; MAYBERRYS AGAIN DISPLAY A MOUTHFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What has 18 letters and runs more than 30 miles an hour? 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the horses owned by Mace and Jan Siegel and their daughter, Samantha, 
who frequently test the Jockey Club's 18-letter rule when they name their 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Two cases are Noassemblyrequired and Sophisticatedcielo, who ran one-two, 5 
1/2 lengths apart, in Sunday's $81,450 Pasadena Stakes at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Mayberry, who trains for the Siegels, scratched Madder Than Mad from his 
three-horse entry in the Pasadena, but the 3-year-old fillies he had left still 
won $62,700 of the purse. Noassemblyrequired's winning share was $47,700 after 
she ran six furlongs in 1:08 2/5, tying the stakes record by Agotaras in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Noassemblyrequired gave Mayberry three victories in the Pasadena in the last 
four years, two of them for the Siegels. They won the 1990 running with 
Ifyoucouldseemenow. 
</P>
<P>
 Noassemblyrequired, a daughter of General Assembly and granddaughter of 
Secretariat, was ridden for the first time by Fernando Valenzuela, after Corey 
Black had her first three starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first time I had been on her, including the mornings," said 
Valenzuela, whose cousin, Pat, is the more well-known rider on the California 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Valenzuela, 24, finished second to Mike Luzzi in the Eclipse Award 
voting for top apprentice in 1989, when his mounts earned almost $1 million. 
Valenzuela said that Noassemblyrequired gave him his first stakes victory at 
Santa Anita since he won the El Conejo Handicap with Sunny Blossom in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been riding a few horses for Brian (Mayberry) since I won with Exemplary 
Leader on opening day," Valenzuela said. "I've also been working some horses 
for him in the mornings." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Mayberry, the trainer's wife and assistant, represented her husband in 
the winner's circle. She said that the Siegels paid $35,000 for 
Noassemblyrequired at a Keeneland yearling auction. The Mayberrys and the 
Siegels form a committee in picking their yearlings, and there was unanimity in 
selecting Noassemblyrequired. 
</P>
<P>
 Noassemblyrequired won her first start, at Del Mar on July 31, but then failed 
twice and was upstaged by stablemates after quickly being moved into stakes 
company at the seaside track. She was third in the Sorrento two weeks after her 
maiden victory and ran next to last after a poor break in the Del Mar Debutante 
on Sept. 4. Other Mayberry horses did better, Rhapsodic finishing second in the 
Sorrento and Sardula winning the Debutante. 
</P>
<P>
 Madder Than Mad, who had a second and a victory in her two starts, was 
scratched because she drew the unfavorable No. 1 post position and the 
Mayberrys believed that she needed more time between races. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with Sophisticatedcielo, Noassemblyrequired paid $6.60 as the slight 
favorite over Jacodra's Devil, who finished third, beaten by more than seven 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocorde's Message broke from the inside to take the lead, but 
Noassemblyrequired trailed only briefly before taking the lead for keeps at the 
half-mile pole. There were solid fractions of 21 2/5, 43 4/5 and 55 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian thought that my filly couldn't lose before the race, and he was right," 
Valenzuela said. "The only thing he told me in the paddock was to lay off the 
speed, and he sure knew the filly better than I did." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Arcangues, a marginal candidate for the Santa Anita Handicap on March 5, had 
his first workout for trainer Richard Mandella on Sunday, going three furlongs 
in 39 1 /5. Mandella began training Arcangues after his French trainer, Andre 
Fabre, saddled him for a 133-1 upset in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa 
Anita on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Wekiva Springs, who broke his maiden at Santa Anita on Oct. 31, winning by 11 
lengths at 1 1/16 miles, ran the same distance Sunday and outfinished Ferrara 
in a stretch duel. . . . Assistant trainer Jeff Lukas, still in a coma after he 
was injured trying to stop a runaway horse at Santa Anita on Dec. 15, moved his 
hands and opened his eyes briefly at the hospital during the weekend. "I was 
hoping that they would upgrade his condition to serious, but they didn't," said 
Wayne Lukas, Jeff's father. . . . The Santa Anita handle after seven days is 
averaging $10 million, 39% better than the same period last season and 35% 
ahead of the previous meeting.

SPEEDSKATER TALBOT SAYS HER SPECIAL BURDEN IS NOT HEAVY 
</P>

 Kristen Talbot was ready to put her Olympic speedskating hopes on hold after 
her 19-year-old brother, Jason, was told he has aplastic anemia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit us all pretty hard," she said. "It changed our lives in a matter of 
seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jason, also a speedskater, told her not to change her Olympic plans. She 
is racing in the U.S. long-track trials, but after competition ends next 
weekend, she will go to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore to donate bone 
marrow for her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason's condition affects bone marrow from producing red blood cells and 
platelets. Kristen and her other three brothers were tested for marrow matches, 
and she was judged the best donor because her general good health makes her 
likely to recover quickly from the procedure. She said the chances are 80% 
Jason's body will accept the marrow and be cured. 
</P>
<P>
 Talbot, 23, is struggling to put aside the burden of Jason's illness and her 
own hospital stay. She was sixth Sunday in the second staging of the women's 
1,000-meter race and overall is seventh with one 1,000-meter race left. She is 
fourth overall after two stagings of the 500 meters, with two more scheduled 
next weekend at the Pettit National Ice Center. In each event, the United 
States can send four skaters to the Lillehammer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Concentrating) hasn't been too bad because I know they're doing everything 
they can for my brother back home," said Talbot, who is from Schuylerville, 
N.Y., near Albany. "I've been able to put my head together. I would have liked 
to have skated better this weekend, but each race is a little better and I hope 
next weekend I'll continue to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Blair of Champaign, Ill., broke her track record in the 1,000 with a 
time of 1 minute 20.64 seconds, and Dan Jansen of Greenfield, Wis., did the 
same in the men's 1,000, in 1:13.37. Blair leads the 1,000-meter standings with 
80.75 points, followed by Chantal Bailey at 83.26, Chris Witty at 84.045 and 
Michelle Kline at 84.135. Jansen leads the men with 73.48 points, followed by 
Nathaniel Mills at 75.565, David Besteman at 75.815 and Brendan Eppert at 
76.045. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, who has set track records in each of her five races, received treatment 
on her sore left leg Sunday and didn't talk with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, of Boulder, Colo., won the first of two women's 3,000-meter races in 
4:35.01. The surprise leader in the men's 5,000 was KC Boutiette of Tacoma, 
Wash., an in-line roller blade racer who began speed skating less than two 
months ago. His time was 7:07.49, which he says he can improve upon next 
weekend in the second and final running of the 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he does, he might not make the U.S. team because qualifiers' times 
must be among the 32 fastest 5,000 times in the world by Jan. 31.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I make the team, it'll be great," said Boutiette, who wears in-line 
skating boots fitted with speed skating blades. "I could quit right now and be 
satisfied. I've done everything I wanted just by qualifying for the Olympic 
trials." 
</P>
<P>
 Talbot said soreness from the marrow procedure won't deter her from donating 
again -- even to a stranger -- and it won't keep her from competing in the 
Olympics. But first, she has to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think just another week of training is going to help me," said Talbot, who 
was 25th in the 500 meters in 1988 and 17th in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to have some good races next weekend, but I'm pretty happy with where 
I am."

STABILIZING INFLUENCE; HORSEMANSHIP OFFERS EL FIG RIDERS A RESPITE FROM 
INNER-CITY LIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rico Evans was astride his brother-in-law's horse Gentle, going at an easy 
gait on the greenbelt along South Broadway, when the young parolee approached 
and asked if he could ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him sure, if he came over to 131st and Figueroa," Evans recalled. When 
the parolee showed up, he told Evans that he had been a passenger in a car 
involved in a drive-by shooting and that he had just completed a two-year 
prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he didn't want to go back to that old lifestyle, and I put him to 
work cleaning stables, showing him how to care for a horse," Evans said. "He 
fell in love with Gentle, saved his money from odd jobs and wound up buying the 
horse." 
</P>
<P>
 The young man has since completed his probation, bought a truck and stayed out 
of trouble, said Evans, a drug rehabilitation counselor who also teaches 
riding. "He attributes that to being around the stable," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before there were Crips or Bloods -- or drive-by shootings, for that 
matter -- in South-Central Los Angeles there was the gang over at the El Fig 
Stables -- a magnet for plumbers and police officers, mechanics and engineers, 
carpenters and just plain cowboys since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got brick masons, rubbish collectors, aerospace workers and security 
guards," said Bert Martin, 65, a retired Army Command Sgt. Major who has 
stabled horses at El Fig for 19 years. "The bond here is horsemanship." 
</P>
<P>
 Horses can be depended on, said Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent, who stabled 
his horses at El Fig for 10 years and still stops by. "Horses take away the 
frustration of politics," he said. "You know what a horse is going to do. In 
politics, a guy embraces you one day. The next day he stabs you in the back." 
</P>
<P>
 El Fig is the place where former world champion bull rider Charlie Sampson, a 
native of nearby Watts, was introduced to rodeoing, and dozens of teen-agers 
still show up daily after school to muck stalls and exercise their animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as often called simply "the Hill," El Fig takes its name from the 
intersection of El Segundo Boulevard and Figueroa Street. But a motorist could 
pass that corner daily without knowing that more than 2,000 head of horses call 
it home. 
</P>
<P>
 Until about five years ago, there was an El Fig riding stable where horses 
were available to rent. But the business closed after the owner died. 
</P>
<P>
 No signs mark the spot where the horses are stabled. The area appears covered 
in the functional, box-like buildings of light industry that have eaten up much 
of the former riding area. But a turn east from Figueroa at 131st Street leads 
to an alley cutting through junkyards heaped high with rusted out cars, 
trailers and other metallic odds and ends. The stables line the alley for about 
four city blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a bull rider for 25 years," said C.B. (Sugar) Alexander, 52, huddled in 
a knot of horse owners around a fire barrel. "I put Charlie Sampson on his 
first bull. I rode bulls because my daddy rode bulls. All my life I had to 
compete with my daddy's reputation. Everybody always said he was better than 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Alexander, who turned to driving 18-wheelers after an injury ended his 
rodeo career in 1981, gets a beam in his eye when he talks about his inclusion 
in the 1986 book "Black Cowboys." His daddy would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
 The cowboys and cowgirls at El Fig show up regularly in parades, in horse 
shows or at schools where they introduce urban youngsters to horses. Come 
February, though, the amateur rodeo circuit gets under way, carrying on the 
tradition of Bill Pickett, the legendary black cowboy who invented bulldogging. 
Many of the riders are getting ready for the weekend events. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilber (Bobo) McDaniel, 14, a freshman at Paramount High School, has been 
practicing roping and bareback riding. He began riding only six months ago, but 
he looks like a seasoned veteran astride Evans' roan appaloosa Too Sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play basketball, and the coach yells a lot," Wilber said. "Around the 
house, my mom gets upset. All of that is stress. But when I go riding, all of 
my feelings are in the horse. It releases stress for me. It's just plain fun." 
</P>
<P>
 His attitude is exactly what his mother, Vernell McDaniel, had hoped for.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make sure that my son would not become a victim of the violence 
in the city," said McDaniel, 37, a Compton police officer for the past 11 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers when her father brought her to the stables when she was a girl, 
and riding is now giving her and her son "the opportunity to experience some 
things about each other that I would never have been able to do had I not come 
up here." 
</P>
<P>
 She knows she and her son are closer from "just the riding in the sunsets, the 
air, nature. The guys up here on the Hill have taken a special interest in me 
and my son. It's like home to us. I feel more comfortable here than I do at 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel introduced her son to horses at a critical time, said Evans, an Army 
brat who began riding while attending a military academy in Kentucky. "He was 
at that age when gang activities were pulling at him and girls were pulling at 
him," Evans said. "He was at that point in life where he was asking: 'Which way 
do I go?' Riding has been a wonderful strategy for them both. 
</P>
<P>
 "A plus at the stable has been our ability to reach out and start touching 
some of these inner-city kids, to turn them around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Johnson remembers that as a child in Magnolia, Ark., he would run to a 
fence whenever he saw affluent white horsemen out riding their Tennessee 
Walkers. He would press his face against the slats "just so the horses could 
walk right in front of me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never, ever in my life that I can remember as a child did a person who owned 
those horses ever stop and say: 'Son, would you like to rub the horse?' -- let 
alone ride the horse." 
</P>
<P>
 That is when his prayer became a broken record: "Lord, let me have a horse." 
</P>
<P>
 He now has a pair of what Evans calls the "finest Tennessee Walking horses at 
the stable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Being black and growing up in South-Central Los Angeles, there was a lot of 
peer pressure and a lot of other alternative means for becoming involved in the 
wrong things," said Johnson, 33, an operating maintenance engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Horses gave me an alternative to being a part of a gang, being a part of the 
hip crowd -- the boys who want to go out on Friday and Saturday night and do 
things that don't lead to a productive lifestyle."

NEW SKETCH RELEASED OF SUSPECT IN KILLING OF SOUTH BAY OFFICER; INVESTIGATION: 
THE MORE DETAILED COMPOSITE WAS DRAWN BY THE ARTIST IN THE POLLY KLAAS CASE. 
MANHATTAN BEACH RESIDENTS CONTINUE TO VISIT AT AN INFORMAL MEMORIAL TO THE 
FIRST POLICEMAN SLAIN IN THE BEACH COMMUNITY.

<P>
 As mourners paid their respects to the first police officer slain in Manhattan 
Beach, authorities Sunday released a new sketch of a suspect in the shooting of 
Officer Martin Ganz. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz, 29, was shot three times while making a Dec. 27 traffic stop outside the 
Manhattan Village shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The new sketch, more detailed than one released last week, was drawn by the 
artist who prepared a composite in the Northern California kidnaping of Polly 
Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a good chance that this is really going to help us," said Sgt. Bob 
Stoneman of the Sheriff's Department. Authorities sought out the artist, Jean 
Boyland of Oregon, after hearing of her work in the Klaas case. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect is described as a dark-haired Asian man in his late 20s or early 
30s with a medium build, possibly 5-feet-6-inches to 5-feet-10-inches tall. He 
is described as also having a clean-cut, very neat appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have received about 300 calls, "yet it's not taking us in any 
one direction," Stoneman said. Investigators were continuing to search for the 
drivers of two vehicles filmed by a nearby bank camera, possibly within minutes 
of the shooting: a small black car and a white, two-door hatchback. 
</P>
<P>
 No motive is known for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman began firing at Ganz as the officer approached the door of his car, 
investigators said. Ganz retreated behind his squad car, but the gunman 
followed on foot and fired three more shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz, a five-year member of the police force, did not return fire and his 
service revolver was found on the ground near him. Ganz did not radio in the 
license plate of the vehicle he stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The spot where Ganz was shot has become an informal memorial to the slain 
officer, filled with flowers, candles and other tributes, including a sign 
reading, "Stop the Madness." 
</P>
<P>
 Some flowers came from residents of the beach community. Some were donated by 
law enforcement officers from other cities. Most were placed there anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly changed us," said Joanne Sturges, a Manhattan Beach resident 
who took a break from her Sunday shopping to visit the site. "It's made us 
aware of the fact that we're not isolated." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, mourners paid their respects to Ganz, dressed in uniform, 
at the White and Day Mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service for Ganz, a Garden Grove native survived by his mother and 
five sisters, has been set for 10:30 a.m. today at American Martyrs Catholic 
Church. Interment at Inglewood Memorial Park will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 A poem was displayed Sunday at the site of the shooting. It read: 
</P>
<P>
 "Frustrating. That's what it's like to be a cop today. We hired that guy to do 
a job. A job too rotten for us to do. Then we isolate him. Fight him. Ignore 
him. And that's what it's like to be a cop. And it's getting worse . . . (So) 
smile at the next policeman you see."

CITY'S COYOTE TRAPPING POLICY FACES REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan Klenner awoke Sunday to find a "snowstorm" of white feathers and the 
savaged carcasses of her last eight pet chickens strewn about the back yard of 
her family's Woodland Hills home -- the gruesome result, she said, of a 
nocturnal visit by prowling coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 The family called the Los Angeles Department of Animal Regulation for help. 
But they got the same answer they heard when two more of their chickens 
disappeared around Christmas: The city of Los Angeles is no longer in the 
coyote-trapping business. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, largely as a result of such complaints, the city Board of Animal 
Regulation is to begin reconsidering its 6-month-old policy against trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Klenner, who spent Sunday morning picking up what remained of the 
birds she considered her pets, the city's discussion is coming more than a 
little late. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went out there and it was carnage," Klenner said. Had the city placed traps 
after the prior attacks, "this probably would not have happened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the city animal regulation department had routinely responded to 
residents' coyote complaints by providing and even setting the traps. But that 
ended last June, when outgoing animal board members, at the urging of animal 
rights activists, halted the use of box traps. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, animal control officers simply offer advice on how to prevent attacks and 
tell residents to contact government agencies that still trap coyotes in 
certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The current panel -- its members mostly appointed by Mayor Richard Riordan -- 
is free to set its own policy. But department officials and animal board member 
Lynne Exe -- who has publicly favored renewed trapping -- have said they doubt 
the current five-member board will change the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it continues like this, there's going to be some severe damage to 
somebody," said city animal regulation Lt. Richard Felosky, who heads the West 
Valley Animal Care and Control Center in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife activists have argued the city should not be in the business of 
managing wild animals. They already argued successfully to ban leg-hold traps 
as cruel to coyotes, and say the box traps -- although supposedly more humane 
than those used in the past -- can cause severe pain to the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, one animal board member recently estimated it would cost the city 
about $100,000 a year to resume trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Klenner said she and others in her neighborhood who have lost animals 
to suspected coyote attacks want the city to reinstate trapping. In the 23 
years that she and her family have lived in their Woodland Hills house, Klenner 
said, they always kept animals but never had a coyote problem until last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not legitimate to say we've moved into coyote habitat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officials said the halt to trapping, the abundance of food and 
small animals in neighborhoods and the recent brush fires that consumed wild 
areas have all combined to drive coyotes into city streets and spurred 
residents' complaints. Activists have long contended that coyotes are being 
squeezed out of their habitat and into conflict with humans because of 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Laura Chick said she has been getting constituent complaints. 
But she expressed concern about the cost of resuming trapping, adding, "I'm not 
convinced yet that trapping is going to control the problem effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of stuff clouding this issue, emotions and fear," Chick said. 
And she said she believes "one of the most effective ways" to avoid attacks is 
to take preventive measures such as not leaving food out and fencing in small 
domestic animals at night. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to her eight white chickens -- bantam birds with silky, hair-like 
feathers -- Klenner said a coyote had to scramble over two fences, including a 
five-foot-high chain-link surrounding the corral where the birds roosted. 
</P>
<P>
 The family heard no disturbance overnight. But when she went outside Sunday 
morning, Klenner said, "From a distance, I saw a patch of what sort of 
resembled snow on the ground. And I knew instantly I had a lot of dead 
chickens." 
</P>
<P>
 Although other predators also are known to kill chickens, Klenner said she is 
convinced the attackers were coyotes, even though she found no firm proof. 
</P>
<P>
 If she replaces the birds, Klenner has no intention of keeping them in cages 
at night to ensure their safety. "That's not the way I choose to keep birds," 
she said.

TEMPERATURES SOAR TO RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summery temperatures broke a 101-year-old record Sunday as the weather brought 
thousands of Southland residents to the beaches, and tantalized visiting 
Wisconsin football fans as they boarded planes for home. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-pressure system pushed the temperature to 84 degrees at 2 p.m. at the 
Civic Center. That was one degree higher than the Jan. 2 record set in 1893, 
according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 In Glendale, it hit 87 degrees, the warmest in the region.

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CECILIA RASMUSSEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For almost 100 years, Griffith Park, the biggest U.S. municipal park to be 
entirely surrounded by a city, has survived fires, floods, a curse, deathbed 
skulduggery and Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, initially on the wild edge of the city, is now an oasis in the heart 
of built-up hills. In its mossy dells, legend has it, Cahuenga Indians once 
held their councils and hunted grizzly bears and other animals with bows and 
arrows. 
</P>
<P>
 This jumble of topography, ranging from emerald lawns to rugged forest, later 
became part of Rancho de los Feliz, a land grant awarded in 1796 to the 
corporal who led three soldiers and 44 settlers here in 1781 to found the city 
of Los Angeles. His name was Jose Vicente Feliz and, as a reward for his 
services to the crown of Spain, he collected 6,677 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The land remained in the family until 1863, when Antonio Feliz lay dying of 
smallpox. He had sent Petranilla, his beloved niece and heir, to Downtown Los 
Angeles -- quite a jaunt from the rancho in those days -- so she could be safe 
from the spreading disease. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After she left, Antonio Coronel, a former mayor and school superintendent of 
Los Angeles, is said to have come skulking along to get the dying old man to 
sign over all his land to Coronel, cutting Petranilla out of the inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
 Petranilla was, to put it mildly, quite angry when she found out about all 
this. According to the tale published in "On the Old West Coast," a 1930 book 
by the great storyteller Horace Bell, she promptly informed Coronel that his 
life was going to be ruined, that there would be a blight on the land, that all 
the cattle on the estate would die, that the oak trees would wither and that a 
flood would virtually wipe out the whole place. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bell's fanciful account, Petranilla died on the spot of grief after 
delivering her curse. But according to historians, she lived to the age of 92, 
and Coronel did not really cheat Feliz out of his land, but purchased it later 
for $1 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Afraid that the curse might really come to pass, Coronel quickly sold the 
ranch to Leon Baldwin, a wealthy businessman. Baldwin was said to have invested 
heavily in the ranch, but it was plagued by misfortune. His cattle died in a 
drought and his crops were devoured by grasshoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Financially ruined, Baldwin (who would later be murdered) sold the ranch in 
1884 to a Welsh immigrant named Griffith Jenkins Griffith. The same year, a 
flood wiped out all the oak trees -- and almost everything else in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Every point of the reputed curse was met. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years after buying the rancho, Griffith discovered that he was stuck: 
Nobody would buy the land because of the curse, so he decided to donate his 
property as a Christmas gift to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate his gift, Griffith invited city fathers to dine with him on the 
rancho at the old Feliz adobe. As the festivities continued through the night, 
an uninvited guest, the ghost of Antonio Feliz, allegedly crashed the party. 
</P>
<P>
 The ghost seated himself and said, "Senores, I am Antonio Feliz, come to 
invite you to dine with me in hell. In your great honor I have brought an 
escort of subdemons." As the lights went out and the screeching demons came 
dancing into the hall, the city fathers all made a mad dash for the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelenos who heard about Griffith's encounter with the supernatural would 
probably have been cheering for the ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before Griffith shot his wife in the eye in a notorious case, he was not 
very popular with the other people in town -- one reason he decided to give his 
land to the city as a way of making amends. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith would make more donations over the years as penance for his misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after the turn of the century, when Griffith was apparently under the 
impression that his wife, Christina, was "in league with the Pope and the 
church to poison him so she could turn all his money over to the Catholics," he 
shot her in their Santa Monica hotel room, according to the Griffith Park 
Quarterly. Griffith Griffith was convicted of the nonfatal shooting, but he was 
out of jail in a year. Soon afterward, he made other donations of land to 
enlarge the park and to provide for the Griffith Observatory, although some 
people raised a fuss over accepting 
</P>
<P>
 anything from a man who had shot his wife.  
</P>
<P>
 Griffith never could quite overcome his image problems. Even at his death in 
1919, he was detested by many. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it seemed as if the park could not escape the curses laid upon its 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Tragedy continued to strike in the park. During the Depression, about 1,500 
public relief workers in the park came rushing to put out a brush fire on Oct. 
3, 1933. Some climbed down into the steep Mineral Wells Canyon to fight the 
blaze, but having little or no firefighting experience, 29 of the workers died 
when they were engulfed by fire while trying to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years afterward the park carried the scars of the blaze, etched in 
the trunks of the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Floods and fires have raged in the canyons and across the hills of the park, 
but the 150-year-old adobe, located on Crystal Springs Drive and built by Jose 
Vicente Feliz's descendant, Jose Paco Feliz, in 1853, has survived. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-room building, with its original open fireplace, has been used over 
the years by park maintenance employees as an office. The adobe was modified in 
recent years with a porch addition and new roof tiles. It is being 
</P>
<P>
 renovated and will soon be used for additional office space. Although park 
rangers have never reported seeing a ghost in the adobe, every once in a while 
a park visitor will claim to have seen the ghost of Antonio Feliz at various 
points in the park. Others say they can see the face of Petranilla, with a lace 
mantilla upon her head, on a rocky ledge protruding above a trail. CECILIA

3 MEN CHARGED WITH CARRYING MOLOTOV COCKTAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men were arrested during a traffic stop early Sunday after Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies found Molotov cocktails, a flare gun and containers 
of gasoline in their car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies from the Lennox station had stopped the vehicle for speeding near 
113th Street and Normandie Avenue about 3:30 a.m., and noticed a heavy odor of 
gasoline coming from inside their vehicle, Deputy Diane Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies found four of the incendiary Molotov cocktails -- bottles filled 
with fuel and plugged with a wick that is ignited and hurled. They also found a 
flare gun, ski masks, gloves and several containers of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Isaac Nash, 21, of Los Angeles, and passengers Jonathan Turner, 
21, of Indio, and William Morrell, 21, of Long Beach, were arrested on 
suspicion of possession of a destructive device, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 They were jailed in lieu of $100,000 bail each, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men refused to say why they had the explosives or what they planned 
to do with them, Hecht said.

MESSAGE IS MIXED ON O.C.-ARTS PALETTE; '94 A LOOK AHEAD: CRYSTAL BALL, CRYSTAL 
BALL, WHAT SHALL UNTO US BEFALL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Skeptical minds want to know: Just how bankable are the cultural plans, 
predictions and expectations for the new year that's upon us? 
</P>
<P>
 Can we rely on Huntington Beach's plan to open an art center in May? 
</P>
<P>
 How about predictions on how the most prominent newcomer to the local arts 
scene will make his mark? 
</P>
<P>
 What about the dismal expectation of further funding cuts to municipal arts 
programs? 
</P>
<P>
 Herewith is a list, admittedly subjective and not without caveats, calibrated 
according to the bankability of some of the developments we're told are the 
1994 docket. 
</P>
<P>
 * Probable, unless you don't believe in Santa Claus or that construction 
projects are ever completed on schedule:  
</P>
<P>
 The most tangible, visible change to the local arts landscape would be the 
opening of the Huntington Beach Art Center, envisioned as a multipurpose 
facility to show home-team and visiting artists to "include Orange County in 
the national arts dialogue," says Naida Osline, Huntington Beach's cultural 
services supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening date for the center, which occupies a refurbished building near 
the community's main drag, has been postponed several times because of delays 
in the $1.1-million face lift. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Osline said recently, it now "looks like we'll open around May, and 
that's not going to shift much." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadly speaking, what can be expected from the center? 
</P>
<P>
 A focus that leans toward "process and experimentation," rather than finished 
product, Osline said. "The identity of it will evolve, and that's part of what 
will be interesting: how it develops, how new staff people we'll bring on" will 
have an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, near Lake Forest -- and comparatively less probable, if only 
because of its vast size -- would be the construction of a $20-million, 
24-screen AMC Theaters movie complex that, developers promise, will show art 
and foreign films as well as mainstream fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local theater owners have reported a hearty demand for such films as 
"Howards End" and "The Piano," and Edwards Theaters Circuit Inc. likewise plans 
to devote screens to foreign and art movies in its new 18-screen center, 
scheduled to open in 1995 in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Very likely (but who's going to like it)?  
</P>
<P>
 Economic forecasters are predicting that the county's economy won't perk up 
much until 1995, which means more cutbacks can be expected for cities' already 
strained arts programs, says Joe Felz, director of the Fullerton Museum Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Felz said, however, that possible cuts "might not be as bad or as intense" as 
in 1993-94. During that period, for example, the Fullerton center's allocation 
from the city was $30,000 less than the previous fiscal year. Still, 
municipally funded arts organizations' increasing reliance on private-sector 
support will continue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along those lines, the Muckenthaler Cultural Center expects to reach an 
agreement with Fullerton on whether to ween itself off city funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have an answer one way or another by the end of the first quarter," 
center chairman Bruce Seldeen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * We're not sure how likely, but it ' s certifiably likely people will be 
watching closely:  
</P>
<P>
 Will Tom Tomlinson, entering his first full calendar year as the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center's new executive director, make major changes in 1994? 
</P>
<P>
 The center's charter -- to present musical theater, opera, ballet and 
classical music -- won't change, at least until additional theaters are built, 
says Timothy L. Strader, vice chairman of the center's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Strader said, Tomlinson will help book "individual shows" by "popular 
entertainers (whom) we have not been able to accommodate in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Strader said the center expects more open dates this year because artists that 
might have played the center will instead perform at such nearby venues as the 
Irvine Barclay Theatre and the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Such individual events are "exactly the kind" Tomlinson booked in his former 
post as president of the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts, Strader said, 
and "he has the contacts and experience to make that happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sinatra and Victor Borge, the piano-playing comedian who turns 85 today, 
are among the entertainers Strader said he had in mind, but, he asserted, more 
contemporary performers on the cutting edge of culture will "absolutely" be 
considered, as the "opportunities present themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 *Not only unlikely, but don't expect it:  
</P>
<P>
 Merger talks between the Orange County Philharmonic Society and Pacific 
Symphony, shelved earlier last year, will not be resumed in '94, both parties 
say. The idea had been discussed as a way to address the respective groups' 
financial woes, which have, however, eased considerably with recent fund 
raising. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no plans to consider resurrecting" the talks, said Dean Corey, the 
society's executive director. "None." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no reason to" discuss the issue further, agreed Pacific Symphony 
board president Rondell Hanson, "although we have had very preliminary 
discussions about the possibility of doing some joint activities in educational 
outreach." 
</P>
<P>
 * We'll believe it when we see it. Maybe:  
</P>
<P>
 Renewed efforts to come up with some sort of countywide arts council are 
alleged to take place in 1994, even though, as of late December, no date had 
been set for a promised meeting this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's first such effort, which produced a viable, but ultimately doomed 
agency, came in the early 1970s; its most recent attempt fizzled a couple of 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is not the first community to go through a couple of 
incarnations of a council before it takes," Gloria Woodlock, programs officer 
for the California Arts Council, said recently. But, she added, "I think now 
it's about time!" 
</P>
<P>
 * Let's fling reality aside and talk hope:  
</P>
<P>
 Some local arts officials are hoping that 1994 will bring an end, finally, to 
divisive controversies over the arts, personified by the Robert Mapplethorpe 
brouhaha and lately rehashed when a Newport Beach city councilman slammed the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum for exhibiting work about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Jane Alexander has taken over as head of the National Endowment for 
the Arts, "hopefully there won't be so much controversy," said the Fullerton 
Museum Center's Felz.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly good news to have someone in there who is an artist and has an 
appreciation for the arts and will advocate for them." 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm hoping," said Huntington Beach's Osline, "is that more politicians 
come out and talk about the value of the arts. We only hear from them when 
they're talking about" issues they perceive as negative. "Why not discuss the 
economic spinoff or the intellectual stimulation of the arts in a community?"

THE YEAR IN MOVIES; '93 A RECORD-SMASHER AT THE BOX OFFICE; 'MRS. DOUBTFIRE,' 
'PELICAN BRIEF' PROPEL FINAL WEEK AND 'JURASSIC PARK' CHEWS UP THE COMPETITION 
AS INDUSTRY RECEIPTS HIT $5.2 BILLION. 
</P>

<P>
 Led by "Mrs. Doubtfire" with Robin Williams and Sally Field, and "The Pelican 
Brief" with Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington, the motion picture business 
ended 1993 with a rousing week at the ticket windows -- a week that pushed the 
year's box-office gross to a record high. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on which box-office sources one consults, the box-office "year" 
ended a week ago, ended Friday, or will end in a few days. But on one point all 
agree: It was a record year. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran analyst A. D. Murphy of the Hollywood Reporter said the 1993 total 
gross hit $5.2 billion, beating the former record of $5.03 billion set in 1989. 
The results reversed the downward trend of 1990, 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The final week of 1993 and the New Year's Day weekend ending Sunday were among 
the best of the year, with some analysts saying the total gross of $165 million 
to $170 million will be among the best ever for a seven-day period. The 20th 
Century Fox release of "Mrs. Doubtfire," which has been in release since late 
November, scored a huge $17 million for the weekend. Warner Bros.' "The Pelican 
Brief" earned $12.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The year also will be remembered as the year of "Jurassic Park," Steven 
Spielberg's dazzling tale of a dinosaur theme park that goes out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, seven movies ("Jurassic Park," "In the Line of Fire," "The Fugitive," 
"The Firm," "Sleepless in Seattle," "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Indecent Proposal") 
surpassed the magical $100-million mark at the box office, compared with eight 
during 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 But in 1992 the biggest film was "Batman Returns" with $163 million. In 1993, 
"Jurassic Park" alone grossed twice that amount. With its $339-million gross to 
date in the United States and Canada, the Spielberg film is the equivalent of 
at least two blockbusters. ("Jurassic Park" still has not surpassed Spielberg's 
reigning box-office champ in the United States and Canada, "E.T.," with an 
estimated $359-million gross in its initial release. But, worldwide, "Jurassic" 
is the king, with a gross of $531.4 million, for a total to date of $870.4 
million.)  
</P>
<P>
 "Jurassic Park" was just the kind of movie that theater owners dream about. It 
drew huge crowds and played for months. The longer a movie plays, the bigger 
the share of the gross that goes to the theaters, the less to the studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, veteran Southern California movie exhibitor James Edwards Sr. 
of the Orange County-based Edwards Cinemas chain was reflecting on 1993, and he 
recalled a Hollywood truism: "There's nothing wrong with the movie business 
that a good movie won't cure." 
</P>
<P>
 At least a dozen popular movies fit that category during the year, Edwards 
recalled. "In my 60 years in the business, I've never seen a string of strong 
box-office movies as we had last summer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the blockbusters, there was also robust business in 1993 for a 
few specialized titles, said Gary Meyer, president of the Landmark Theater 
chain that is owned by the Samuel Goldwyn Co. Among the better performing 
titles were Goldwyn's release of Kenneth Branagh's widely hailed adaptation of 
"Much Ado About Nothing," which grossed $23 million, and "The Wedding Banquet" 
with a gross of $6 million. Miramax Films did well with "Like Water for 
Chocolate," with a gross approaching $20 million, and "The Piano," which has 
accumulated $13 million to date. Sony Pictures Classics scored with about a 
$12-million gross on "Howards End," the 1992 Oscar-nominated movie that played 
strongly in the first quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 If 1993 produced some major original hit movies, it was also a year that was 
unkind to sequels -- with the exception of the current family film "Beethoven's 
2nd" from Universal. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a major difference from 1992. At the end that year, the top three 
grossing movies were sequels -- "Batman Returns," "Home Alone 2" and "Lethal 
Weapon 3." At the end of 1993, there is nary a sequel in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Most '93 sequels -- including the much-anticipated Disney/Touchstone "Sister 
Act 2" and Paramount Pictures' "Wayne's World 2" and "Addams Family Values" -- 
didn't live up to expectations. Only a year ago, "Sister Act" and "Wayne's 
World" were on the list of the top 10 grossing films of 1992; "Addams Family" 
was a $113-million grossing picture from 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sister Act 2," despite a big New Year's weekend, has grossed only $40 million 
to date; "Wayne's World 2," $39 million; and "Addams Family Values," $45 
million. Successful sequels generally perform about two-thirds as well as the 
original; none of these has come close. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a year of some major turkeys -- a year when even box-office champ 
Arnold Schwarzenegger took a free fall in the over-hyped dud "Last Action 
Hero." That costly, action- and effects-laden movie from Columbia Pictures 
eventually drew $50.2 million but could not overcome the negative rap that it 
simply did not work and possibly has not even recouped its $80 million 
estimated cost. In international markets the movie eventually grossed about 
$102 million, for a total of $150.2 million -- but only about half of which is 
returned to the studio as film rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 The current "Geronimo: An American Legend," also from Columbia, is estimated 
to have cost at least $40 million to produce and has grossed only $15.2 million 
after a month in release and despite the studio's pride in the film. "Everyone 
really liked the picture and we are surprised by the results," said Columbia's 
Jeff Blake, president of domestic distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wesley Snipes and Sylvester Stone "Demolition Man" from Warner Bros. also 
ranks among the year's biggest losers. With a costly production estimated by 
some sources at well over $50 million, the film took in about $56 million -- 
only about half of which goes back to the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Even such popular stars as Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood appearing together 
in "A Perfect World" didn't fare well, proving that perfect casting doesn't 
necessarily make for a perfect world at the box office. The skimpy gross for 
the Warner Bros. release has been $29 million. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it was a great year for Clint Eastwood, the director and 
star of the 1992 Oscar winning "Unforgiven," which did big box-office in the 
first quarter of 1993, and his artistic and box-office success in summer's "In 
the Line of Fire," one of Columbia's bright spots in a generally slow year for 
that studio. And Stallone, despite "Demolition Man," scored what was considered 
a comeback with TriStar Picture's "Cliffhanger," which ranked among the year's 
top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The year's most profitable movie will certainly be "Jurassic Park," with 
eventual earnings of as much as $2 billion, including home video and related 
products. Other winners include Warner Bros.' "Free Willy," with a $25-million 
budget and $77 million in domestic gross, and "Sleepless in Seattle" with a 
budget of $25 million to $30 million and $125.1 million in gross. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the talk of 1993 being the year of family films, the only true "family 
film" among the top 10 is "Free Willy." Not a single film on the top 10 was 
from Disney; the closest it came was with "Cool Runnings," which cost under $10 
million and has grossed$59.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last week of 1993, ending with the New Year's weekend, was among the best 
the industry has ever recorded. After "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Pelican Brief" in 
first and second place, the weekend's No. 3 and No. 4 films look to be in a 
dead heat: "Tombstone" and "Sister Act 2," with about $8.5 million each. 
"Grumpy Old Men," came in fifth with $7.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
 After that: "Beethoven's 2nd," $7.1 million; "Wayne's World 2, $3.9 million; 
"The Piano," $2.3 million; "Geronimo," $2.1 million, and "Ghost in the 
Machine," $1.5 million. In limited release: "Schindler's List" did $1.4 million 
on 76 screens; "Philadelphia," $150,000 on four screens; "Six Degrees of 
Separation," $210,000 on 19 screens; "Shadowlands," $61,000 on three screens; 
and "The Summer House," $300,000 on 60 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Although ticket prices are somewhat higher than they were in 1989, the number 
of tickets sold in 1993 was the highest since 1989, reversing a three-year 
decline. In 1989 the number of tickets sold was 1.13 billion. Using Murphy's 
$5.2 billion figure, and the Motion Picture Assn. of America's figure on 
average ticket price of $5.09, the number of tickets sold in 1993 would be 
about 1.01 billion -- up from 964.2 million in 1992 but still down from 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily Variety reports in today's editions that the year was a record $5.04 
billion. Variety analyst Leonard Klady, who uses Dec. 31 as the cutoff date for 
the year (rather than a box-office week, which would run through this coming 
Thursday), said his figures show that 1993 beat the previous record of $4.6 
billion set in 1992. At the Top in '93 
</P>
<P>
 The top-grossing films in the United States and Canada released last year: 
02,29,19 Movie (Company) Gross in millions 1. "Jurassic Park" $339 (Universal) 
2. "The Fugitive" $179 (Warner Bros.) 3. "The Firm" $158.3 (Paramount) 4. 
"Sleepless in Seattle" $126.4 (Sony/TriStar) 5. "Mrs. Doubtfire" $123.5 (20th 
Century Fox) 6. "Indecent Proposal" $107 (Paramount) 7. "In the Line of Fire" 
$102.2 (Sony/Columbia) 8. "Cliffhanger" $84 (Sony/TriStar) 9. "Free Willy" $78 
(Warner Bros.) 10. "Groundhog Day" $71 (Sony/Columbia) Films released at the 
end of 1992, but that earned a large portion of their box-office gross during 
1993 include: "Aladdin" (Walt Disney), $217 million; "A Few Good Men" 
(Columbia), $141.3 million; "The Bodyguard" (Warner Bros.), $122 million; 
"Scent of a Woman" (Universal), $63 million; and "The Crying Game" (Miramax), 
$62.5 million.

THE YEAR IN POP MUSIC; VARIETY, HOLIDAY BOOM MAKES FOR A RECORD YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Albums by such diverse artists as pop diva Mariah Carey, rapper Snoop Doggy 
Dogg and rockers Pearl Jam led a recording industry holiday sales surge that 
pushed business in 1993 to a record $8.7-billion level -- an estimated 9% more 
than 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diversity was definitely the key to 1993," said Mike Shalett, chief operating 
officer of SoundScan, the New York research firm that compiles computerized 
sales data for the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a year when we saw underground artists like Snoop Doggy Dogg and 
Pearl Jam hold their own against pop stars like Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey. 
A year when two knuckleheads like Beavis and Butt-head ran neck and neck with a 
saloon crooner like Sinatra. I mean, how much more eclectic can it get?" 
</P>
<P>
 While Carey's "Music Box" dominated sales during the final weeks of the 
holiday season, Whitney Houston's "The Bodyguard" was the year's top seller, 
accounting for 5.3 million units and more than $67 million in receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 After Houston, the best-selling albums of 1993 were: Janet Jackson's "janet.," 
4.1 million; Kenny G's "Breathless," 3.7 million; Pearl Jam's "Vs.," 3.5 
million; Carey's "Music Box," 3 million; Eric Clapton's "Unplugged," 2.8 
million; Dr. Dre's "The Chronic," 2.8 million; Garth Brooks' "In Pieces," 2.6 
million; Stone Temple Pilots' "Core," 2.5 million; and Billy Joel's "River of 
Dreams," 2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although figures are not yet available for the final week of the holiday 
season, industry sources estimate that consumers have purchased about 130 
million albums since Thanksgiving. Retailers got their biggest sales gains the 
week ending Dec. 26 when customers bought about 31.8 million albums -- an 8.5% 
increase above the 29.3 million units sold during the same period in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Top 40 list is packed full of surprises, including unexpected hits 
from acts such as Dr. Dre, Frank Sinatra, Stone Temple Pilots, Blind Melon, 
Meat Loaf and the soundtrack from the movie "Sleepless in Seattle." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the industry credit SoundScan with the high visibility of 
non-traditional artists in the pop market. In many cases under the industry's 
old system, store personnel frequently under-reported sales of lesser-known 
artists, thus causing their showing on the prestigious pop chart to be lower 
than it should have been. 
</P>
<P>
 These artists fare much better under SoundScan because figures are entered 
into a computer every time a clerk runs an album through a bar code scanner at 
the sales register.

 "Different kinds of music draw different kinds of people into record stores," 
said Stan Goman, senior vice president of the Sacramento-based, 82-outlet Tower 
Records chain. "In 1993, the industry released a wide variety of powerful 
albums and that greatly expanded the demographic base of consumers willing to 
spend money on music." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Murray, vice president and general manager of the music division of the 
Ft. Lauderdale-based, 520-outlet Blockbuster chain, concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just the kids out there spending money last year on music," Murray 
added. "We saw lots of their parents shopping and their parents' parents 
shopping too." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey conducted by Studio City-based Macey Lipman Marketing suggested an 
18% increase in credit card usage among holiday shoppers who frequently 
purchased several CDs and cassettes at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of 200 retailers (representing more than 8,000 outlets) interviewed by 
Lipman were satisfied with sales in 1993, but cited concern about the growing 
threat of price-slashing from discount houses such as Target and Circuit City, 
who sell Top 40 compact discs below cost for $10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Record store owners are afraid this new trend is undermining the perceived 
value of the CD," Lipman said. "The big fear is that consumers are getting the 
wrong impression that record retailers are cheating customers when in fact the 
discount houses are selling their compact discs at a loss."  
</P>
<P>
 Jay Berman, chief executive officer of the Recording Industry Assn. of 
America, the Washington organization that represents the nation's six largest 
record companies, said sales gains registered in the United States were also 
reflected around the world. International sales are expected to increase 
approximately 7% over last year's $28.7-billion mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "1993 turned out to be a very strong year abroad as well as at home for the 
recording industry -- particularly the fourth quarter," Berman said. "And we're 
confident that the momentum will maintain throughout next year. There are just 
so many incredible albums being released these days it makes everybody 
optimistic about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Other major sellers during 1993: the Spin Doctors' "Pocket Full of Kryptonite" 
and Meat Loaf's "Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell," both 2.4 million; 
Aerosmith's "Get a Grip," 2.3 million; "Sleepless in Seattle" soundtrack, 2.2 
million; Pearl Jam's "Ten," 2.1 million; Snoop Doggy Dogg's "Doggy Style," Rod 
Stewart's "Unplugged and Seated" and SWV's "It's About Time," all 2.1 million; 
Sting's "Ten Summoner's Tales," 2 million; Billy Ray Cyrus' "Some Gave All," 
Alan Jackson's "Lot About Livin," U2's "Zooropa" and Frank Sinatra's "Duets," 
all about 1.8 million units. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers said the year's biggest superstar disappointment was Guns N' Roses' 
"The Spaghetti Incident," which is sinking down the chart, selling only 760,000 
copies since its Nov. 23 release.

Q&A WITH CHEAP TRICK'S RICK NIELSEN; 'WE'RE JUST ONE OF THOSE BANDS THAT LIKES 
TO PLAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 C heap Trick has sold about a zillion albums since 1977 when it blasted out of 
Chicago like the Cubs in the World Series of Ernie Banks' dreams. The band also 
has been on the road a lot, making new fans as it cranks out that melodic arena 
rock.  
</P>
<P>
 Songs like "Surrender," "I Want You to Want Me" and "Ain't That a Shame" 
continue to prosper on the radio. And you can bet your baseball cap that the 
band will play those biggies and more when it headlines the Coach House in San 
Juan Capistrano tonight and Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Rick Nielsen is the guy in the baseball cap with the upturned bill, looking 
like he just won a Huntz Hall look-alike contest, flailing away on an endless 
supply of customized guitars. Robin Zander is the rock god front man who makes 
the hearts of girls who have them beat faster. Jon Brant is the bassist, and 
Bun E. Carlos sits in the back and hits the drums.  
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen talked about things recently from his Chicago home:  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How many baseball caps do you have? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I've got a lot. People still send a lot of hats to me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many guitars do you have? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I've had about 2,000 over the years. I still have a hundred or two. I have 
one of Jimi Hendrix's guitars, a Dave Edmunds guitar. I have a John Lennon 
guitar that he played on "Imagine." I also have a 25th-anniversary Fender 
Stratocaster numbered 000007. The ones that came before were for Jimi Hendrix, 
Buddy Holly, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Richie Blackmore and like that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let me ask a dumb question. Why do guitarists always change guitars on 
stage? Is it like a hitter changing bats or what? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know. I've always done it. There was never any big plan or 
anything. I just hit my guitars so hard, I knock them out of tune. The most a 
guitar lasts for me is two songs. I usually take 17 to 20 guitars to a gig. 
I've got a guitar guy who takes care of them for me. He's been with me since 
the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many Cheap Trick albums are there? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think there's about 14 or 16, if you count the greatest-hits albums. We 
just released two albums in Japan. One of them is "Budokan II." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You guys were on Epic forever. It's unusual for a band to stay anywhere for 
so long. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah, we were at Epic longer than any of their presidents. We were hoping 
they'd put our names on a bathroom door, a mop closet door, something. We sold 
a few records for them, but now we're with Warner Bros., and our new album is 
due in February. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How often do you guys tour? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We tour pretty much all the time. We play a lot of colleges. We're just one 
of those American bands that likes to play. If we waited until we had a radio 
hit to play, we probably wouldn't play as much. We've been everywhere -- Japan, 
Australia, South America, Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why has Cheap Trick lasted so long? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Like I said before, we like to play and we like to think we do a good job. 
A lot of musicians, our peers, like us. You can go down the list . . . a lot of 
the new bands say we've influenced them. Also, we're too dumb to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the secret to survival on the road? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You have to deal with everything with humor, because the day-to-day 
drudgery can be intense. So we pick on each other and laugh at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What advice would you give an aspiring rock star still trapped at Burger 
King in a funny hat? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The main thing is practice, practice, practice. If you have a chance to 
play, even for little money, take it. Take any job you can get. We've played at 
bar mitzvahs, weddings, funerals. A long time ago, we had gigs in places like 
Minot or Fargo, N.D., and there'd be seven people in the bar and four of them 
would be us, and the other three would be fighting on the pool table. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the Chicago scene like these days? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's always a lot of good music and places to hear it. There's always a 
lot of good new bands and good old bands, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How 'bout those Bears? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Bears are always good on defense and bad on offense. They always have 
half a team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Anything you haven't done? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I just did some work with Michael Kamen and the Rockford Symphony Orchestra 
on an electric concerto. I'd like to see more of our stuff get orchestrated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cheap Trick plays tonight and Tuesday at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 
Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $27.50. (714) 496-8930.

A LIFESAVING TIMEOUT; FOOTBALL FANS TRADE THE COUCH FOR A COT TO DONATE BLOOD 
IN RED CROSS DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a long holiday weekend, and one of the biggest pro football games of 
the year -- the game, if you asked Larry Weese -- was on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was Weese Sunday morning at a Red Cross bloodmobile, lying on a cot 
with a needle in his arm as he missed the first half of the big game. Holiday 
weekends and football could wait, he decided; this he was doing for the sake of 
his two daughters, 5-year-old Natalie and 6-year-old Madeline, who insisted on 
watching daddy roll up his sleeve and give blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always thought this was a noble pursuit," said Weese, a 48-year-old real 
estate broker from Newport Beach. "It's a good way to teach (the daughters) a 
lesson. They should know you have to help the sick and the poor because you 
never know when you'll need help yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of year when the Red Cross is looking for more people like Weese, 
more than 50 donors turned out Sunday morning at the Our Lady Queen of Angels 
Church in Newport Beach to give a pint of blood and help patients in need. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive was part of the Red Cross' "Save-a-Life Sunday" program, aimed at 
recruiting donors from among local churches and other religious groups. Another 
drive was also held Sunday at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Red Cross officials have appealed for help from the public 
because of a traditional shortage of blood donors over the holidays. In the 
weeks leading up to Christmas, officials said, blood donations drop by as much 
as half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, this time of year is always a problem for donations," Juliet 
Benton, an official with the Red Cross' Orange County office, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have large companies that are closed for Christmas, people are on 
vacation, and that kind of thing, so they just don't give as much (blood) as 
they usually do. But the need doesn't decrease." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Red Cross collects about six million units of blood each year, 
representing half of the nation's supply. But its procedures have come under 
increased scrutiny by Congress and federal health officials for more than five 
years, chiefly because of concerns about blood that could be contaminated with 
the AIDS virus and other blood-borne diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the Red Cross launched a multiyear, $140-million reorganization to 
strengthen safety procedures. And in May, under pressure from the federal 
government, the agency enacted further steps to correct problems in 
record-keeping, accident reporting and other areas.  
</P>
<P>
 But such concerns appeared far from the minds of most donors Sunday in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Red Cross really seemed very professional in all their methods," said 
Matt Pence, 18, a high school senior who heard about the drive at his church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't given blood in a while, so I figured why not -- it's convenient," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katy Eklof, 19, wanted to give blood, too, but she never got the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rice University student had been wanting to donate for a while, but Eklof 
said she was always worried it might weaken her for her cross-country 
competitions. Now that she is home in Costa Mesa for the holidays, however, she 
figured it was a good time.  
</P>
<P>
 There was just one problem: The lean runner didn't meet the 110-pound minimum 
for donors, so Red Cross officials told her thanks, but no thanks after she 
showed up at the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to give blood," she said, adding with a smile: "But I'm not 
going to go home and stuff myself with cookies or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Weeses, the event turned into a family affair, as dad gave blood, and 
Madeline and Natalie, sitting with their mother, Karen, watched in apparent 
fascination and munched on cookies. The girls talk a lot about medicine, so it 
was a good experience, Karen Weese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dad had missed the first half of the big Dallas Cowboys-New York Giants 
football game, but as Karen Weese watched her husband get bandaged up by Red 
Cross personnel, she had a feeling about what the afternoon held. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaning over to her two daughters, she whispered: "Now he's probably going to 
say he has to lie down and watch football the rest of the day."

HOMELESS SHELTER FOR MENTALLY ILL FINALLY GETS OK; HOUSING: BEACON HOUSE IN 
ORANGE IS THE RESULT OF A 7-YEAR EFFORT. IT WILL OFFER 12 RESIDENTS SERVICES 
RANGING FROM COUNSELING TO SOCIAL ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It once provoked a community uproar that pitted angry residents against 
homeless advocates and elected officials.  
</P>
<P>
 But now, after a seven-year battle, Orange County's first homeless shelter for 
mentally ill people is finally becoming a reality. Last month, renovations 
began on Beacon House -- a three-bedroom house on Drew Way in Orange that will 
eventually become home to 12 homeless people who suffer from a variety of 
mental disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous delays, Beacon House is expected to begin accepting residents 
in May. The shelter will provide everything from counseling to social 
activities and outings for its residents -- its goal being to help people make 
the transition into a job or an independent living situation.  
</P>
<P>
 The decision to go ahead with the shelter has been hailed by mental health 
advocates as a ground-breaking one that sends a message to the community that 
society must make room for the mentally ill homeless. According to mental 
health experts, about 8,000 people call Orange County's streets home. Although 
estimates vary, some believe that as many as 40% of these suffer from various 
mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter will be funded through a $350,000 state Housing and Community 
Development grant. 
</P>
<P>
 However, for the coalition of nonprofit groups, businesses and others who 
fought for the project, it has been a long road. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter has been plagued by so many setbacks along the way that Episcopal 
Services Alliance (ESA) Executive Director Dennis White credits divine 
intervention with finally bringing matters along. "I feel that somebody up 
there must have wanted this to happen because there were so many times that we 
could have given up," said White, whose ESA will administer the facility. "It's 
also the commitment from the community that has finally made all of this 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 According to White, the original plans called for a 19-bed home. But after 
strong opposition from residents in the neighborhood had stalled the project 
for several months, organizers were forced to scale back their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after the plan was finally approved in the face of strong community 
protest by the Board of Supervisors in May, 1992, project organizers ran into 
further problems. About $200,000 of the total state Department of Housing and 
Community Development grant -- originally awarded in 1986 -- got held up in 
1992 because of state legislators' inability to agree on the new budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since our funds got held up in the state budget, we didn't have the money to 
close escrow," White said. "That was No. 1. Then, we had to resubmit all the 
building plans for approval because we had changed the plans from a 19-bed to a 
12-bed facility." 
</P>
<P>
 The ESA already runs Martha House, a 10-bed shelter for homeless women, also 
in Orange, and Anchor House, a shelter in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 However, according to advocates for the mentally ill, those shelters are not 
equipped to deal with the growing numbers of homeless people who suffer from 
manic depression, schizophrenia and other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, ESA officials will hold a ground-breaking ceremony at 10 a.m. to 
officially celebrate the birth of the shelter. It will take place at the site 
at 18792 Drew Way. The public is invited to attend.

1ST ANTI-GANG UNITED FRONT FORMS IN O.C.; ENFORCEMENT: PROJECT WILL TEAM 
FEDERAL, COUNTY AND CITY OFFICIALS IN SANTA ANA, SITE OF TWO-THIRDS OF 
GANG-RELATED COUNTY KILLINGS IN '93. HARD-CORE REPEAT OFFENDERS WILL BE 
TARGETED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten federal, county and city law enforcement officials will team up in two 
weeks in the first united front formed to crack down on hard-core gang members 
who commit violent crime in Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 The police officers, prosecutors and probation officers -- all working out of 
Santa Ana City Hall -- will monitor, arrest and prosecute repeat offenders as 
part of the city's Street Terrorist Offender Project, or STOP. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is the inaugural step of the Orange County district attorney's 
$2-million program to battle gangs countywide. It brings welcome reinforcements 
to Santa Ana, where about two-thirds of the county's gang-related killings last 
year occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Ana has got the most aggravated problem, so it was the most logical 
place to start," Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Task force members want to target the toughest gang leaders -- the small 
number of gang members who commit the most frequent and violent crimes -- in 
six Santa Ana neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Police won't say which areas or gangs they'll target or how they'll try to 
dismantle gang leadership, but they promise to kick off the program visibly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Police Department is the only agency in the county so far to 
enlist agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to join 
anti-gang teams, said Santa Ana police Capt. Dan McCoy, who is coordinating 
STOP. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar gang task forces will start in four other Orange County cities this 
year as part of a gang strategy inspired by Westminster's Tri-Agency Resource 
Gang Enforcement Team, or TARGET. 
</P>
<P>
 That project has successfully built dozens of criminal cases against hardened 
gang members. Violent crimes -- homicides, attempted homicides and felony 
assaults -- have dropped 59% in the city since TARGET started two years ago, 
Westminster Police Chief James Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program probably will face its litmus test in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Ana has over 50 gangs with about 8,000 members or associates," Police 
Chief Paul M. Walters told the City Council at a recent meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 30 years, the city's violent crime rate has outpaced population 
growth by 9 to 1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 County organizers have raised the stakes accordingly by giving Santa Ana two 
county-funded law enforcement teams. The four other cities involved in TARGET 
-- Anaheim, Garden Grove, Orange and Costa Mesa -- will each receive one team. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana will start its program with a team of one deputy district attorney, 
one investigator from the district attorney's office and two probation 
officers. A second team will join STOP in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors will handle cases from initial search warrants through taking the 
cases to court, and probation officers will check for gang members who violate 
their terms of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team also includes four police officers, McCoy said, with an occasional 
liaison officer with the state Department of Corrections. If they need help, 
team members can also draw on Santa Ana's regular 10-officer gang detail, which 
investigates day-to-day gang crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 ATF agents will play a different role. "There are significant penalties for 
firearms violations that don't exist in state law but do exist in federal law," 
McCoy said, so ATF agents will steer certain firearms-law violators to the U.S. 
Attorney's office for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agents also track guns used in crimes to their original owners and 
investigate how the guns got into the hands of gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Santa Ana police staff member will use a computer network spanning 
Orange and Los Angeles counties that can match weapons used in crimes in 
different locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents in beleaguered areas said they welcome police involvement. "If 
(police) want to come in and search apartments for guns, I'll give them the 
keys," said one Santa Ana apartment building manager, who asked that his name 
not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy said the coordinated effort will help police officers get warrants 
quickly so they can search for weapons where specific hard-core gang members 
live. "We will be having more searches for firearms that are connected to gangs 
under the STOP program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster's Cook cites improved communication among various agencies as the 
key success of the TARGET approach in his city. "As the team works together, 
they can move with lightning speed through the system," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove, Orange, Anaheim and Costa Mesa will get teams between now and 
the middle of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 A prosecutor and probation officer will be assigned to South County by 
mid-year to help with gang-related prosecutions there, but they will not be 
teamed with specific sheriff's deputies. Sheriff Brad Gates has declined to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana City Councilman Robert L. Richardson is optimistic about making law 
enforcement efforts more efficient. Because prosecutors and investigators work 
together to target certain gang members, "they know their profile," Richardson 
said. "That communication -- you can't put a price on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said residents will not see changes in gang violence overnight. Cook, 
for one, said it took a year to fine-tune his program.  
</P>
<P>
 McCoy predicted a similar timeline for Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "This problem took 20 years to get to the point it's at," McCoy said. "But 
over a period of time, those neighborhoods impacted should see a reduction in 
gang crime."

LOCAL LIMBAUGH FAN CLUB LEADER ENSURES RUSH IS ON; CONSERVATISM: WITH HER SEVEN 
RADIOS, RUTH CALVERT, FOUNDER OF THE 79-MEMBER CHAPTER, NEVER MISSES THE SHOW. 
</P>

 Ruth Calvert has seven radios strategically placed throughout her Orange home. 
And every weekday morning, it is not unusual for all of them to be broadcasting 
the same station. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, Calvert explains, she is never out of earshot of one of America's 
more prominent voices -- Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hard thing is remembering to turn them all off," said Calvert, who is 
president of the only California chapter of the National Rush Limbaugh Fan 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Since founding the Orange County chapter in October, Calvert has seen 
membership jump from 21 to 79. The ranks of the Orange-based club boast an 
impressive list of local conservative politicians, including state legislators 
John R. Lewis and Gil Ferguson, and Orange City Council members Joanne Coontz, 
Mike Spurgeon and Mark Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are coming together because of a lot of frustrations over the direction 
the country is headed," Calvert said. "We are saying our country is going to be 
OK, and also we are keeping a sense of humor, which is the greatest thing Rush 
has given us." 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of Calvert's organizing pluck, the year-old national fan club, 
which has 15 chapters with 1,200 members across the country, recently named her 
its "Woman of the Year." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a sweetheart of a lady," said national club President Ken O'Rourke, 71, 
a retired minister in El Jobean, Fla. "Not only does she head up a chapter, but 
she got more members in her first month than I did in three." 
</P>
<P>
 "God bless Orange County," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rush Rooms," places in restaurants and taverns where fans informally gather 
to listen to the best-selling author and media personality, have flourished for 
years. But the fan club takes allegiance to the rotund wise guy -- who opines 
that America has been "held hostage" since President Bill Clinton took office 
-- a step further.  
</P>
<P>
 For a one-time fee of $10, supporters receive wallet-sized membership cards, a 
certificate and a subscription to national and local Rush Limbaugh newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I'm proud to be a card-carrying member," said Lewis (R-Orange), who is a 
charter member of the Orange County chapter, and a longtime Rush Limbaugh fan. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's monthly Saturday morning meetings typically consist of an hourlong 
presentation by a featured speaker, sandwiched between two hours of Limbaugh TV 
highlights. The local chapter hopes its programs will advance the conservative 
agenda and promote the American ideals of family values and free enterprise, 
club members say. 
</P>
<P>
 But, they hasten to add, the club's ultimate purpose is to help citizens make 
up their own minds, free from the influence of the "liberal" media and even 
Limbaugh himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have interpreted that we are just a bunch of blockheads who 
can't think for ourselves, and that Rush is leading us around by the nose," 
Calvert said. "That's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
 To aid members in understanding how the other end of the political spectrum 
thinks, Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) will address the club about liberal views on 
wealth at its next meeting on Saturday at the Rib Trader Restaurant in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, a friend and fellow conservative of Limbaugh's for the past decade, 
said he's glad Orange County is demonstrating its support for the outspoken 
personality.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think people gravitate toward Rush because he expresses exactly what they 
are feeling," said Ferguson, one of the few politicians Limbaugh has ever 
publicly endorsed. "I think these clubs will spring up all over." 
</P>
<P>
 While the club may be politically informative, members say the meetings also 
provide a good opportunity for fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really the fan club type," said Don Phillips, 64, a salesman from 
Orange. "But this is a chance to have a stimulating chat over a cup of coffee 
on Saturday mornings. It's a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Had it not been for a chance conversation Calvert had at church about a year 
ago, the club might never have been organized. During choir practice, Calvert 
overheard someone talking about a conservative author who labeled some women's 
rights activists "femi-Nazis." She immediately purchased Limbaugh's 
best-selling book, "The Way Things Ought To Be." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just died laughing," Calvert said. "I usually don't have time to read, but 
I couldn't put it down." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert said she then tuned into Limbaugh's radio broadcasts, but initially 
found bothersome his playful declaration of his talent being "on loan from 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying I'm 120% Christian, but that ruffled my feathers," she said. 
"I thought about that a while and that's the doggone truth. We all have talent 
on loan from God and isn't it wonderful that God gave him the talent of a sense 
of humor?" 
</P>
<P>
 But like millions of other devoted listeners, Calvert was eventually won over 
by Limbaugh's blend of politics and humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert said she is not worried that the adulation emanating from a national 
fan club will swell the conservative icon's ego. Limbaugh's bluster is merely 
an on-air affectation, she maintains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that's his image," Calvert said. "But he's down to earth, he's really 
nice to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's as humble as humble pie," she added.

 Acres of orange trees surrounding Irvine Valley College provide a pleasant 
place to walk and relax. Oranges growing on the trees attract birds and 
squirrels to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 A stroll through the groves, which partly border the student parking lot, is 
an escape from automobile fumes into a fragrant park. Sun-dried rinds under a 
tree show where someone has grabbed a quick snack from a limb. 
</P>
<P>
 The college has 40 acres of oranges. Two acres of trees are used to produce 
cash for student activities. During the year, student groups have allowed 
people to pick oranges for 25 cents a pound. Eager harvesters have picked as 
many as 12,000 pounds of oranges in one weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The college first opened the grove to the public in 1984. Besides raising 
money for students, the trees have also been used for community outreach 
programs, like letting poor people pick fruit free. 
</P>
<P>
 The oranges have also been wrapped in holiday gift packages for needy people 
and single-parent families, a college spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The college installed drip irrigation in the groves in 1991 to save water and 
increase the quality and size of fruit. Each 12- to 15-foot tree is heavy with 
small fruits. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: THE AGRICULTURAL HERITAGE; FULLERTON; MARKET FOR FRESH 
GOODS IS GROWING 
</P>

 Every Wednesday morning, Daniel Hashiba packs up his truck with crates of 
lettuce, tomatoes, strawberries and whatever other crops are in season on his 
five-acre farm in the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Hashiba heads for the Fullerton Certified Farmers' Market at Woodcrest Park, 
where he joins 39 other vendors selling everything from home-grown herbs to 
organic honey and bonsai trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The lettuce and vine-ripened tomatoes Hashiba sells are not unique but he is: 
Of the 40 farmers at the market, he is one of just two from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took over for my parents 16 years ago," Hashiba said. "We used to farm more 
but it's harder to find the land to lease. (Farming in Orange County) is sort 
of a dying thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hashiba's observation is supported by figures compiled by the Department of 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, there were 14,750 acres of orchards in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 That figure dropped to 10,000 in 1982 and was down to 7,100 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetables were grown on 8,433 acres last year, down from 14,180 in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Two major factors in the decrease in farmland are increasing land values and 
demand for housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But one segment of the agriculture market has actually benefited from farms 
being turned into housing tracts: nursery stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers, ornamental trees and plants, potted plants and sod make up the 
best-selling crops in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, nursery stock accounted for more than half of the county's total 
income from agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 While local farms have dwindled, the popularity of the county's two farmers' 
markets have continued to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the demand, farmers from San Diego to Fresno truck in vegetables, 
citrus, honey and other produce. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mona Amoon, manager of the Fullerton market, that facility has 
grown from a handful of vendors in 1981 into a thriving operation that draws 
about 1,000 shoppers every Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are attracted by the prices, which are generally lower than in 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 Others think the produce sold here is higher in quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you look at these grapes," said one man to his female companion, gently 
hoisting a bunch of red grapes. "Each one is perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 At Hashiba's stand, two women admire the large heads of lettuce he has on 
display. His mother, Asano Hashiba, tells the women the price. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that's low," the woman said to her companion. "We'd pay double that" at 
the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Lorenzini, who manages the Orange County Farm Bureau farmers' market 
at the Orange County Fairgrounds, said that 35 to 40 farmers show up every 
Thursday to sell produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become very popular with buyers," Lorenzini said. "We don't keep track 
of numbers, but it's always very crowded here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Farm Bureau is considering adding a Friday night market in Huntington 
Beach. Over the summer, a trial market was very popular there, Lorenzini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Certified Farmers' Market runs from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. 
Wednesdays at Woodcrest Park on Orangethorpe Avenue. 
</P>

Thursdays at the Orange County Fairgrounds. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: THE AGRICULTURAL HERITAGE; TUSTIN; AN HONOR SYSTEM AS 
SWEET AS HIS ORANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a few feet away from the busy intersection of Red Hill and Walnut avenues 
is a fruit stand that's as ordinary as any fruit stand around. It sells freshly 
picked Valencia oranges for $2 per bag and avocados at 50 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign says self-service, and please, put the money in the metal box on the 
top shelf. No one watches. Anyone could just walk away and not bother to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the honor system, says Matt Nisson, the fruit stand owner, and although 
on occasion fruit is stolen, for the most part the system works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the time to sit here and watch it all day," said Nisson, 69. 
</P>
<P>
 The fruits are picked from a four-acre orange grove nearby, the remnants of a 
sprawling farm that Nisson and his family have cultivated since 1915. Most of 
the land is gone now, swallowed by commercial and residential developments, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising property taxes and the increasing cost of raising the oranges have 
forced many growers to sell their land, a phenomenon that is still happening 
around Orange County, Nisson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nisson, who lives in the same house where he was born, plans to continue 
growing oranges and avocados, "just as my father and my grandfather did before 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my own piece of history," he said. "I could step back in time and 
forget about the chaos of the world around me." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, while the noise from passing cars filled the air, Nisson 
happily bagged oranges as his two dogs played in the back yard. Hens and 
chickens scurried around. 
</P>
<P>
 Celia and Leo Kucheck of Leisure World in Laguna Hills pulled into the 
driveway to buy four bags of oranges, greeting Nisson effusively. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming here for 20 years," said Celia Kucheck. "He grows the 
sweetest oranges. Today, I'm buying for myself and my neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Clark, another regular customer, drove from Los Angeles to get his weekly 
supply of oranges. "They're great, they're fresh, my kids love them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After several run-ins with the city, Nisson has been allowed to operate the 
fruit stand on Walnut Avenue, set back about 20 feet from the street, in what 
looks like a bus turnout. He usually sells oranges from May until September. 
But this year, the state Department of Agriculture has included his citrus 
grove in a Medfly quarantine area for home-grown fruits. 
</P>
<P>
 Nisson said he has to clean the oranges and avocados, then bag them in a way 
that satisfies state regulations before he is allowed to sell them. "It doubles 
the hassles," he said. He declined to say how much money he makes but said he's 
at least breaking even. 
</P>
<P>
 Nisson's grandfather, Mathias, came from Denmark in 1876, settled in Santa Ana 
and started the family's orange groves. In 1915, Nisson's father, Clarence, 
bought 10 acres in Tustin and started growing his own oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 After a stint with the U.S. Army during World War II, Nisson bought five acres 
of orange groves from his father and later added five more acres. But by 1968, 
Nisson was forced to sell most of his land. 
</P>
<P>
 His three children are also raising oranges, so the tradition will continue, 
Nisson said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: THE AGRICULTURAL HERITAGE; LA HABRA; CORN FETED DESPITE 
ITS NON-LOCAL ORIGINS 
</P>

<P>
 Corn doesn't grow in La Habra. It never has. Yet year after year, the city 
honors the vegetable with a festival and parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Corn Festival, which takes place in August, features thousands of 
ears of corn and people come from all over to eat the kerneled, yellow 
vegetable. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival officials even boast of having the "best corn on the cob you can 
find." But it isn't local. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a Food 4 Less supermarket has been the source of the festival's fresh 
corn for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 For 43 years before that, the La Habra Host Lions Club, which sponsors the 
event, bought corn from a Buena Park farmer who stopped growing yellow corn two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration evolved in the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, many local residents were Midwesterners who had migrated from 
the Corn Belt. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't that heritage that dictated the Corn Festival, according to 
festival chairman Chuck Overby. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bunch of Lions were sitting around wondering what they were going to do to 
raise money for charity," he said. "They decided to have a harvest festival and 
said, 'Let's sell bowls of corn.' That's how we got the name 'Corn Festival.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And for 45 years, festival-goers have become accustomed to buying corn at the 
popular event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people care where the corn comes from as long as it's good, and 
our corn truly is," Overby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think we have some deep, dark secret, but all we do is cook the ears 
in the same water so no flavor is robbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People swear it is the absolute best corn they've ever tasted." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of where the corn comes from or how it's cooked, the festival 
raises money that is donated to local charities, Overby added. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45th Corn Festival raised about $45,000, and more than 70,000 people 
attended the two-day event. MIMI KO

 The Garden Grove Strawberry Festival started in 1958 when the strawberry was 
king of the city's agricultural crops. 
</P>
<P>
 The strawberry has since been all but crowded out by growth and development, 
but the festival lives on, attracting crowds of 200,000 or more over Memorial 
Day weekend each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival makes about $100,000 a year that Strawberry Festival Assn. 
directors hand over to worthy local organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Margolin, last year's president, said the festival has dispensed nearly 
$2 million to local organizations in its 35 years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, festival officials allocated about $38,000 to local organizations. 
The board of directors will distribute an additional $60,000 in coming months, 
Margolin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent beneficiaries included: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Billy Barty Foundation, $1,000 to support the needs of "small people." 
Barty has been the volunteer master of ceremonies for the festival's Tiny Tot 
program for eight years and was grand marshal of the Strawberry Festival Parade 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Garden Grove Police Department's Kid Care Program, $950 for equipment to 
photograph and fingerprint children. Also, $1,020 for the DARE program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Garden Grove Sister City Assn., $1,500 for computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lollipop Lodge, $3,000 for renovation of a day care center for ill 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Garden Grove Community Adult Day Care Center, $14,500 to renovate floors, 
buy refrigerator, freezer and equipment for computer programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * GroveShakespeare, $5,000 for tools and new sets for the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assistance League of Garden Grove, $4,500 for dental equipment and to buy 
coats and shoes for needy children served by the organization's School Bell 
program. ROBERT BARKER

 If your back yard is too cluttered for you to grow a crop, there are still a 
few places left where you can try out your green thumb. Several cities have 
established community gardens, small plots of land residents can lease to grow 
vegetables, fruits, herbs and other plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Most charge a small fee to cover the cost of water, usually $10-20 a year, but 
they do have long waiting lists. The following is a partial list of community 
gardens: 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park: 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest community gardens in the county is on 10 acres of land 
leased by the city from Southern California Edison Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The land is divided into 168 plots, with 15-by-20-foot plots renting for $15 a 
year and 20-by-30-foot plots going for $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The garden is on Thelma Avenue west of Knott Avenue. Registration is held in 
September. Preference is given to returning gardeners and about 75% return each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The gardeners grow a variety of fruits, vegetables and herbs, as well as some 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the city's Recreation Department at (714) 562-3844. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach: 
</P>
<P>
 The Oasis Senior Center Community Gardens was established to give senior 
citizens exercise and improved nutrition. The center has 58 plots, each 
15-by-15 feet, including three plots with raised beds for gardeners in 
wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 To participate, gardeners pay $15 a year. According to membership director 
Betty Moses, most of the gardeners grow vegetables, fruit and herbs, but a few 
plots are used for flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is also participating in a program to compost waste from the 
gardens into fertilizer to be used by the gardeners. The garden is at the Oasis 
Senior Center, at Marguerite Avenue and 5th Avenue in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point: 
</P>
<P>
 Named for a former parks and recreation board member, The Harry Otsuba 
Community Gardens has 48 plots, including two that are handicap-accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Plots come in two sizes: 10-by-20-foot plots are leased for $15 a year and 
20-by-20-foot plots are $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The garden is off Street of the Golden Lantern near Stonehill Drive. 
Registration is held in December, and there is a waiting list with 85 names. 
For more information or to be placed on the waiting list, call the Parks and 
Recreation Department at (714) 496-4251. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach: 
</P>
<P>
 Organic gardening is practiced at Golden West College's community garden. The 
55 10-by-20-foot plots rent for about $50 a year, with gardeners ranging from 
college students to senior citizens. Gardeners are not allowed to use chemical 
pesticides or fertilizers. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the college's Community Services Department at 
(714) 891-3991.

 Phyllis Sexton took up gardening for the exercise and to grow a variety of 
vegetables to add to the family's food supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Maciel also putters in the garden daily because he's retired and it gives 
him something to do. Besides, his crops are fresh, good-tasting vegetables not 
found in markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The carrots are firm and crispy, and not mushy and soft like from the grocery 
store," Maciel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitthalbhai Patel, a retired doctor, and his wife, Kantaben, also grow a 
variety of vegetables from seeds from their native India. 
</P>
<P>
 For these urban gardeners, growing their own food has not only become a 
pastime, but a preoccupation. 
</P>
<P>
 They reap their harvests from plots they rent at Buena Park's community 
garden, a stretch of land they seed and sow on 10 acres underneath high-power 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Maciel, 75, garden coordinator, who has been farming his own plot there since 
the city-operated garden started in 1978, said there is a waiting list for 
residents who want to tend one of the 162 plots. The plots rent for $20 and $10 
a year, depending on the size, and include water. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of the community garden, on Thelma Avenue off Knott Avenue, is 
not only the pleasure of working with the soil and watching crops grow, but 
also the rewards of growing fresh produce and fruits. 
</P>
<P>
 "People with a lot of kids can grow vegetables and it's a savings on the 
groceries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maciel, who grows just about everything, including broccoli, cauliflower, 
green onions, radishes, beets and peas, said many residents don't have back 
yards where they can garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexton, 67, who retired two years ago, is one of the newer gardeners. She got 
hooked after helping a friend take care of her plot. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, she planted a variety of crops, including lettuce, Brussels 
sprouts, chives, green beans, snow peas and cucumbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I have a green thumb; I just enjoy growing things," Sexton 
said. "It's fun for me to work in the garden. You're outside in fresh air, and 
you meet other people and share ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patels said gardening is part of their lives. The couple, who have lived 
in this country for 16 years, had grown roses and coffee on their 400-acre farm 
in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still a lover of gardening," said Vitthalbhai Patel, 78. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patels grow 40 kinds of vegetables and fruits they are accustomed to 
eating, such as the papdi , an Indian bean similar to the lima bean, or giloda 
, a miniature cucumber, and passion fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reward is maintaining physical health," Vitthalbhai Patel said of working 
in the garden. "And the family gets the food not readily available here." DEBRA

CRINGE AT CABBAGES

 Although Leisure World is just a few miles from downtown Long Beach, the 
retirement community has always offered residents a hint of country living -- 
thanks to the roughly 1,300 acres of farmland next door at the Seal Beach Naval 
Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of an expansive field off Seal Beach Boulevard turn a rich green during 
the summer as cabbage, pumpkins and strawberries are grown. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the bountiful vistas come a horrid odor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like something rotting," said William J. Doane, a Leisure World resident 
and Seal Beach City Council member. "It is kind of an unpleasant smell." 
</P>
<P>
 The stench emanates from rotting pieces of cabbage and cauliflower that are 
left during harvest to enrich the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 The smell has long been a bone of contention to Leisure World residents, 
especially those who live closest to Seal Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the Navy has attempted to reduce the smell by having crops 
planted farther away from Leisure World, said base spokesman Joe Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
 That has helped somewhat, but residents still report smelling the odor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a minor irritation," Doane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers are allowed to rent land stretching from the active part of the Navy 
base northward to the San Diego Freeway. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: THE AGRICULTURAL HERITAGE; LA PALMA; PROGRESS PUT DAIRY 
COWS OUT TO PASTURE

<P>
 Signs of this city's agricultural heritage have vanished in the 40 years since 
a group of dairy farmers incorporated the community under the name Dairyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The last of the dairy farms that once dominated this community disappeared 
years ago -- replaced by tract houses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, city leaders even changed its name from Dairyland to La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half of the century, La Palma and surrounding communities made 
up a vast cow-grazing area that stretched from Cerritos to Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 As suburban growth began to encroach the area, dairy farmers organized to 
preserve the town's farmland, said Pamela Gibson, La Palma's city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmers won cityhood for Dairyland in 1955 and attempted in vain to hold 
off residential development. For a while, the city required property sites to 
be at least five acres, according to the book "A Hundred Years of Yesterdays." 
</P>
<P>
 But state tax laws favored residential development over farming, and slowly, 
the dairies gave way to housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
 As more residents moved to the city, the remaining farms were viewed by some 
to be more of an irritation than a treasure -- especially during the summer, 
when the cows smelled bad and attracted flies. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said one La Palma council candidate even distributed fly-swatters that 
bore the phrase: "Vote for me and you won't have to use one of these anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1973, just one dairy farm remained in the city, according to the book.

MAN SHOT OUTSIDE PIZZA PARLOR PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A young man was shot and wounded Saturday night in a fight that broke out 
among guests during a pay-as-you-enter party at a pizza parlor, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred shortly after 11 p.m. in a shopping center parking lot 
in the 12000 block of Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Vineyard, manager of New York Pizza, said the restaurant had been rented 
out to a disc jockey who held a private party that guests paid a cover charge 
to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 Vineyard said he did not know the name of the disc jockey. 
</P>
<P>
 No alcohol was served or allowed at the party, which was attended by several 
dozen people, most of them over 18, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was going pretty well until some people came in that nobody 
recognized," Vineyard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stayed for a few minutes and walked out and wanted their money back." 
</P>
<P>
 Vineyard said the bouncers, who were hired by the disc jockey, would not 
return the money and a fistfight broke out in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Shots were fired and a young man came running into the restaurant, his arm 
bleeding, Vineyard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not have the victim's name Sunday. Several people were detained for 
questioning in connection with the shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first and last time" the restaurant has ever rented out its 
facility for a private party, Vineyard said.

MURPHY'S L.A. LAW PLAGUES BADGER FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON and JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 Yes, Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 But winning isn't everything. And for 137 Badger fans, a bad weekend only got 
worse Sunday when they couldn't fly home from a game many of them didn't get 
to. Their plane was stuck in airport asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really has been a nightmare," said Wisconsin stockbroker Steve Berg. "We 
just had all the bad luck that we could have." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the home snows of the frozen Dairy State had to look good to the 
University of Wisconsin fans, after their warm weekend in Los Angeles 
disintegrated into a real-life remake of "The Out-of-Towners." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the 137 fans sat fuming for nearly an hour and a half aboard their 
chartered Boeing 727 at Van Nuys Airport. Finally, the plane started rolling 
toward the runway -- and two wheels plunged through the asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as the passengers were being taken off the plane, two tour operators 
nearly came to blows arguing over who had screwed up the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of screw-ups to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 A bus hired to ferry Badger fans from one hotel to the airport for the flight 
home to Madison failed to show, and they had to commandeer a convoy of taxis. 
</P>
<P>
 And not many got within cheering distance of the Granddaddy of Bowl Games that 
they came for: all of them had gotten stiffed on the tickets they thought they 
had bought weeks ago, and many ended up watching Wisconsin's victory on a TV in 
a Studio City restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday evening, they were dispiritedly organizing a pool on when -- or if 
-- they'd get home. (Word was they were to leave LAX at 2:15 a.m. today, but 
few would have bet the farm on it.) 
</P>
<P>
 "At least they won the football game," said an FAA controller at Van Nuys 
Airport who declined to give his name. "It must be UCLA's revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one more thing that could go wrong," sighed Jeff Manley, owner 
of a Madison travel agency that booked some of the passengers on the trip, 
after fans were taken to a Van Nuys hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least the hotel hasn't burned down yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Berg, the stockbroker, was frantically canceling business appointments in the 
hotel where dozens of dejected Wisconsin fans, still in victorious red and 
white, wandered the halls, drinking beer and bemoaning their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 On another phone, Manley heard the other shoe drop: A second charter plane his 
agency had helped to book for 356 more Wisconsin fans was supposed to leave LAX 
about 9 p.m. Sunday. But when the crew aboard the chartered DC-10 landed at the 
airport, they said they had put in too much air time that day, and refused to 
take off until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're jinxed," sighed Manley. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the fans' troubles started back in Wisconsin, when their plane out of 
Madison was delayed for two hours Thursday night after a water spigot froze and 
they had to fly without coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything was supposed to be ready for them once they hit sunny warm L.A. 
Their $1000 or so was supposed to cover air fare, a hotel room and a ticket to 
the game. But it turned out that vouchers they had been given for game tickets 
would not be honored. 
</P>
<P>
 By New Year's Day, after spending hours chasing down the promised phantom 
tickets, some fans had resigned themselves to watching their beloved Badgers on 
the tube at a restaurant in the Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 A few Badger boosters, however, set out in a frantic, last-ditch search for 
scalpers. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Gobel, 22, a University of Wisconsin senior who flew out with his 
parents and a brother, trudged out to Pasadena on game day and "met scalpers 
from all over the United States" outside the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate, Gobel offered his $500 Gianni watch with a single diamond to one 
scalper. "He looked at me and acted insulted and walked away," Gobel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Badgers' victory over UCLA couldn't quite pull it together for some 
Madison fans. 
</P>
<P>
 After a night of revelry over the Badgers' victory, the fans were scheduled to 
fly out of the Van Nuys airport at 9:15 a.m. Sunday, said Manley. But one bus 
chartered for the fans failed to show up at a Wilshire district hotel, and 
Manley had to hurriedly hire a small flotilla of cabs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a disorganized flotilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristi Massey, 36, from Cottage Grove, Wis., said the driver of her cab got 
hopelessly lost. "We drove around an hour because we couldn't find this place," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At last, the passengers were herded aboard the plane. Where they waited. For 
nearly 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, about 10:30 a.m., the plane began to roll along the taxiway. But 
after about 100 yards, the passengers felt a bump. A flight attendant, almost 
in tears, told the fans the plane was stuck. Its two main wheels had sunk more 
than a foot into the asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Kochevar, the airport's manager, said the plane broke through a thinly 
paved section of asphalt near the terminal that is not typically used by 
heavier jets. Kochevar said the plane's wheels sank into dirt after breaking 
through the asphalt, which he said is only about two inches thick in that spot. 
By late Sunday, crews had freed the plane.

CRIME ISSUE AT FOREFRONT AS STATE SESSION OPENS; CAPITOL: LAWMAKERS WILL ALSO 
HAVE TO DEAL WITH A BUDGET CRISIS. ELECTION-YEAR POLITICS ADDS ZEST TO THE MIX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 State legislators will launch their 1994 session under the golden-domed 
Capitol today, intent on projecting crime, illegal immigration and the need to 
improve public education as their top concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 It being an election year, however, it remains to be seen whether legislators 
will actually pass major laws on such big issues, or get bogged down in 
posturing against political rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it will be an exciting year for political junkies," said Sen. 
Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear Lake). 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators from both sides of the aisle have studied polls, conferred with 
supporters, and read the headlines, and agree that the issue certain to receive 
the most attention is crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Democrats plan an ambitious assault on the proliferation of guns and 
ammunition in California. The Republican focus will be on locking up repeat 
offenders, imposing stricter penalties on juveniles who commit serious crimes 
and criminals who prey on children, and repealing such inmate privileges as 
conjugal visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, making crime a central plank in his reelection bid, has 
called for a special legislative session to consider anti-crime bills, and will 
convene a "summit" on the topic in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who held a high-profile 
economic summit last year, plans to convene another summit in February -- this 
one focusing on education. To assure maximum exposure, the crime and school 
summits will be staged in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget will also command legislators' attention when they return. Senators 
and Assembly members will be confronted with a $40-billion budget in disarray 
for the fourth year in a row. Faced with a deficit of $3.8 billion, lawmakers 
must struggle again to cut programs ranging from health and welfare to aid for 
local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The choices we're left with are the unpalatable and the unthinkable," said 
Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward). 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will present his proposed budget to the Legislature on Friday. The 
Republican governor is expected to propose more money for education and prisons 
to keep pace with increases in enrollment and incarceration, and will ask for 
deep cuts in nearly every other state-supported program. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) said Republicans will be seeking a 
freeze on salaries for the 270,000 state employees as one solution to the 
looming budget crisis. Republican legislators also will attempt to cut direct 
and indirect aid to illegal immigrants, including elimination of state-paid 
perinatal care for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care for all Californians is likely to become a more pressing issue in 
1994. Assemblyman Burt Margolin and Sen. Art Torres, two Los Angeles Democrats 
who are considering running against one another for state insurance 
commissioner, are chairing a special committee to develop California's plan for 
implementing President Clinton's health care proposals. Boosting the chance 
that a plan will emerge, Brown and Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno 
are sitting on the conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee must seek ways to provide coverage for the estimated 6 million 
Californians who have no health insurance, and to obtain more federal funds to 
pay medical costs of indigents and illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Revitalizing California's economy is central to the legislative agenda," 
Margolin said. "Health care reform is central to revitalizing the economy. The 
cost of doing nothing is intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Southern California economy still in the doldrums, lawmakers will try 
to help speed the recovery, as they did in 1993. There will be, for example, 
efforts by Republicans to reduce government regulation of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats and Republicans also are casting crime and fear of violence in 
economic terms. Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles) hopes to get business 
support for a measure that would allow local governments to regulate gun sales. 
As it is, state law governs the sale of guns and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message we're sending worldwide is that the United States is a dangerous 
and lawless place," Caldera said, adding that crime hurts one of Southern 
California's leading industries, tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Democratic anti-gun proposals include a package by Sen. Gary K. Hart 
(D-Santa Barbara) requiring people to obtain a license to buy a handgun and 
ammunition and limit an individual's handgun purchases to one per year. Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti will attempt to jump-start his bill to limit 
the size of ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) has a proposal to force bullet 
manufacturers to place serial numbers on casings. Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood) is pushing for an outright ban on the sale, importation and 
manufacture of handguns in California, plus licensing of current handgun 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the best chance in a long time of getting a crackdown on the 
proliferation of guns," said Friedman, who also will try to revive a bill from 
last year that would have banned smoking in enclosed workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans plan to revive a measure that would send people convicted of a 
third felony to prison for life. The bill died last year, prompting Mike 
Reynolds, a Fresno photographer whose daughter was murdered, to push an 
initiative for the November ballot known as "Three Strikes and You're Out." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of incarcerating the additional prisoners could run into the 
billions. Republicans say money for new prisons could come from health and 
welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we've built enough prisons," Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they will resist efforts to make more cuts in social programs, 
Democrats may offer support for less costly alternatives to prisons, such as 
lower security work camps for nonviolent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't spend a lot of money we don't have," Lockyer said. "People look at 
their shoes when you ask: 'How are we going to finance this? Who's for cutting 
education? Who's for tax increases?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature is coming off an unusually successful year, when Republicans 
and Democrats struck compromises to overhaul the troubled workers' compensation 
system, cut business taxes and pass a $39-billion budget by the 
constitutionally imposed summer deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans and Democrats say they intend to operate without the rancor of 
years past. But 1994 is an election year, and if the past is a gauge, the work 
of legislating could become a sideline in Sacramento as politicians turn their 
attention to raising money and marketing themselves in a quest for votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson faces a serious challenge from either Treasurer Kathleen Brown or 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. The offices of treasurer, controller, 
lieutenant governor, secretary of state, insurance commissioner and state 
superintendent of schools will be open. Among those considering a challenge to 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren is Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 As term limits continue to take hold, as many as 22 members of the 80-member 
Assembly plan to run for higher office or leave office this year. With 30 
first-termers in the Legislature, more than half the members of the lower house 
will have two or fewer years of experience by this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the Senate also will face reelection. Democrats hold 16 of the 20 seats 
that will be up in November, giving Republicans a chance to wrest control of 
that house for the first time since Ronald Reagan was governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate also will have a new leader for the first time in more than a 
decade. Roberti plans to step down and run for treasurer, leaving Lockyer as 
his most likely successor. The transition could take place this month. 
</P>
<P>
 As the politicking and legislating proceeds, the eight-year-long federal 
corruption investigation will continue. Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) and 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), who were indicted in 1993, likely will go 
on trial on corruption charges this year -- and some lawmakers again will push 
for campaign financing reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if campaign reforms are approved, elected officials will be raising huge 
sums of money. Wilson plans to spend up to $20 million on his reelection. The 
Democratic nominee will spend a like amount. With 20 Senate races, 80 Assembly 
races, the cost of the statewide offices, plus an initiative or two, political 
leaders could be asking donors to shell out $75 million or more to keep the 
democratic process operating in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics," said Bill Press, chairman of the state Democratic Party, "may be 
the biggest growth industry in the state in 1994."

DRIVER, 65, HER MOTHER, 84, LEAD CHASE TO O.C.

 A 65-year-old woman and her 84-year-old mother led police cars and helicopters 
on a chase on New Year's Eve from downtown Los Angeles to the gates of Leisure 
World, where officers had to smash open their car window before the women would 
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-mile chase began an hour before revelers ushered in 1994 and reached 
speeds of 75 m.p.h. as the women were pursued by the Los Angeles Police 
Department, at least four California Highway Patrol cars, three helicopters 
from the Anaheim Police Department, and the sheriff's departments of Orange and 
Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't exactly like Smokey and the Bandit, but it was unusual," Sgt. Chris 
Jenkins of the CHP in San Juan Capistrano said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Maria Zoha and her mother, Antoinette Cacciato, both of Los 
Angeles, were on their way to visit relatives in Leisure World when they hit 
another car about 11 p.m. on Broadway in downtown Los Angeles, but did not 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County police officer, tipped by a witness to the accident, 
chased the 1971 Chevrolet Impala the women occupied, and Los Angeles police 
joined the pursuit. They followed the women onto the Hollywood Freeway and then 
southward on Interstate 5, where the driver, Zoha, turned her headlights off, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the car entered Orange County, the CHP took over, authorities said, 
tailing the women all the way to El Toro Road, where their car exited about 50 
minutes after the chase began. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of making a right-hand turn on Avenida de la Carlota, the main street 
in front of Leisure World, Zoha made a left and then a U-turn to double-back to 
the retirement village, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a locked entrance to Leisure World on Via Puerta, the car stopped 
momentarily before backing up, but Zoha and Cacciato were blocked from leaving. 
Zoha, authorities said, refused to unlock her doors, get out of the car or turn 
off the engine. 
</P>
<P>
 A homemade videotape of the encounter shows a CHP officer repeatedly ordering 
Zoha to "turn the car off" before a trooper finally smashed the driver's side 
window with his baton and pulled Zoha from the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoha was taken to Orange County Jail on suspicion of driving without a license 
and evading arrest but was released on New Year's Day. She faces a court 
hearing later this month. Jenkins said Zoha was taken to Western Medical 
Center-Anaheim for psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cacciato was released to relatives who live in Leisure World, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officer Bruce Ferrier said that he did not know how many patrol cars 
pursued the two women, but that teams of three cars could have been involved in 
the chase from each of the four CHP offices that participated, including the 
patrol divisions of Santa Fe Springs, Westminster, Santa Ana and San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrier said the chase wasn't nearly as dangerous as others the CHP has 
participated in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to some of the others we've been involved in, this wasn't much," he 
said. "These were two elderly ladies. They are not criminals. They just wanted 
to get to Leisure World." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Harry Langefeld of Leisure World security said the entrance where the 
women stopped -- one of 14 at the retirement village -- had been locked for the 
night at 11 p.m. Those entering Leisure World must have an identification card, 
clearance from a resident, a decal or a pass to gain entrance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the arrest, about midnight, several hundred people were jammed 
into Leisure World's six clubhouses for New Year's celebrations, Langefeld 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally it's pretty quiet around here," he said. "But New Year's Eve is a 
big deal with lots of parties going." 
</P>
<P>
 Langefeld said he did not know whether the women were related to anyone inside 
Leisure World. 45-Mile Chase 
</P>
<P>
 Two women led police cars and helicopters on a chase from Los Angeles to 
Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Chase begins when authorities are notified of hit-and-run. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Suspects' vehicle exits freeway at El Toro Road and travels south on 
Avenida de la Carlota. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Vehicle makes U-turn and travels north on Avenida de la Carlota. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Vehicle stops at locked gate at Leisure World. Driver is taken into 
custody.

MEXICAN REVOLT IN 2ND DAY; 65 DEAD; LATIN AMERICA: INDIANS CONTINUE TO BATTLE 
GOVERNMENT FORCES. THE REBELS PULL OUT FROM RESORT CITY IN IMPOVERISHED STATE 
BUT CONTROL FOUR VILLAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Indian guerrillas battled soldiers Sunday on the second day of an uprising in 
Chiapas, one of Mexico's poorest states. At least 65 people were reported 
killed in the weekend clashes, the first sign of organized guerrilla activity 
in Mexico since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying they were challenging 70 years of one-party dictatorship, the heavily 
armed Indians had overtaken four communities in the southeastern state 
Saturday. On Sunday, they withdrew from the popular tourist city of San 
Cristobal de las Casas but kept control of three villages and seized a fourth 
after clashing with army troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican reporters returning from a military base about six miles east of San 
Cristobal de las Casas said they counted the bodies of 14 dead after a gun 
battle in a heavily wooded military zone. A Defense Ministry statement 
confirmed the 14 dead, and said another 10 rebels and five soldiers were killed 
near the military base Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two soldiers earlier were reported wounded in the fighting, which apparently 
erupted when an army patrol ran into a minivan carrying some of the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Another battle erupted Sunday evening in the seized village of Ocosingo after 
army troops were attacked by rebels. Reporters counted 25 bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiapas state governor's office in a statement late Sunday said 57 people 
-- 30 soldiers and police, 24 rebels and three civilians -- had been killed in 
the day's fighting. At least eight others died in fighting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, a presidential spokesman indicated that force would not be used to 
quell the insurrection. And a statement from the secretary of defense said 
soldiers in the area were ordered to stay in their barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrilla group, known as the Zapatista National Liberation Army, is 
heavily armed and virtually unknown. It claims 1,500 members, but the Chiapas 
government claimed that no more than 200 had participated in the attacks. Local 
press reports put the total in all the towns at just under 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels had attacked San Cristobal de las Casas, 50 miles east of the state 
capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez, plus Ocosingo, Las Margaritas and Altamirano on 
Saturday. They moved to Chanal, a nearby village, on Sunday. The guerrillas 
took over radio stations, blocked the roads leading in and out of the towns and 
occupied the municipal offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal troops were guarding government installations in the town of Comitan 
to avoid a takeover there. The Pan American Highway was reopened with military 
checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing has been terrifying for us," said Hernan Pedrero, manager of 
the Santo Tomas Hotel on San Cristobal's main plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedrero said the 95 tourists staying at his hotel were taken to Tuxtla 
Gutierrez on Sunday under army escort. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas said they were all Mexicans and had no ties to drug traffickers 
or Guatemalan leftist groups. The source of their arms and uniforms -- army 
fatigues with red bandannas -- was not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the product of 500 years of struggle," they claimed in a lengthy 
declaration of war posted in the occupied communities and read on television. 
</P>
<P>
 They demanded that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari resign, accusing his 
government of ignoring the plight of Indians in the Lacandon Forest, North 
America's largest rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 And they demanded land, farm financing, education and the release of 
"political" prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Ministry issued a statement calling for dialogue to resolve the 
disputes, which it acknowledged are legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiapas, which borders Guatemala, is one of Mexico's poorest states. It has a 
large Indian population and a history of violent disputes over land and 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 As a border state, there is added tension from Guatemalan war refugees, 
Guatemalan army and guerrilla incursions, drug running, bandits and illegal 
logging. Although this is the first organized attack, there were signs of 
trouble as early as last March. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been local press reports of secret guerrilla training camps in the 
region, which Interior Minister Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido, governor of 
Chiapas until the end of 1992, flatly denied. When Roman Catholic Bishop Samuel 
Ruiz, who is based in San Cristobal, continued to voice concern about 
guerrillas, he was branded a troublemaker by the Salinas administration. In a 
controversial move widely believed to be politically motivated, Ruiz was asked 
to resign last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing political parties are already blaming the government for the crisis. 
Leftist presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said that, while he does not 
condone the violence, he believes that the government is responsible for it. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the local government has "sought to silence the demands through 
repression, intolerance, violence and by provoking confrontations between 
different social groups with the intent of defending the interest of a small 
oligarchy." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the guerrillas held a meeting in the central plaza of San 
Cristobal on Saturday night, attended by about 300 cheering people. The rebels 
reportedly said they were fighting for the poor and indigenous peoples of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas sacked the town hall in San Cristobal and looted a government 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatista National Liberation Army is named after Emiliano Zapata, a 
popular hero of the 1910-1917 Mexican Revolution who defended poor peasants' 
rights to free land seized from wealthy landowners.

COLUMN ONE; TELLING ALL WITH WIT AND RAGE; PERSONAL ZINES ARE SELF-PUBLISHED 
GLIMPSES INTO THE LIVES OF TWENTYSOMETHINGS. THOSE WITH A TOUCH OF THE VOYEUR 
CAN FOLLOW THE DETAILS OF ROMANCE, TRAGEDY AND THE BIZARRE.

By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tammy Rae Carland opens up her soul at least three times a year and invites 
perfect strangers in for a glimpse. The part of her on public display is 
occasionally funny, always outrageous and obsessed with a former First Daughter 
she describes as both "geeky" and "this icon." 
</P>
<P>
 She charges two bucks for the pleasure -- and a couple of stamps "if you've 
got them." 
</P>
<P>
 When Carland, 28, of Long Beach, isn't publishing her quarterly "I Amy 
Carter," she does things such as writing open letters to her sisters: 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was nine years old and my rapist said not to tell anyone or he would 
do the same to you I believed him. I had to believe him, it was the only thing 
that kept me alive." For $3.50, you can buy that letter tucked inside the San 
Francisco-based quarterly Thorn. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to decide which is more unusual in this era of media 
conglomerates, dwindling public forums and limping language skills: That 
Carland spews autobiographical bits both harrowing and hilarious on a regular 
basis, or that people she does not even know pay to read those snippets. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, "I Amy Carter" is no People magazine, Tammy Rae Carland no Amy 
Carter -- although she says at times she'd like to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Carland is a practitioner of the "personal zine," a sort of international 
postal salon inspired by equal parts humor and rage. Tales of sexual assault, 
betrayal and a mother's death crisscross in the mails with anti-career stories 
of washing dishes in all 50 states, a catalogue of the best dentist movies of 
all time (an admittedly short list), and a paean to the city of Oakland (also 
rather brief). 
</P>
<P>
 Zines (said zeens ) are perhaps the smallest of the world's small presses -- 
self-published, low-budget and often profane, varying wildly in size, 
circulation and quality. Personal zines are the sotto vocce version -- filled 
with the sort of information formerly penned within the impervious walls of 
friendship and family. 
</P>
<P>
 The often twentysomething publishers of personal zines are carrying on a 
conversation at once both public and private and doing it in intimate print -- 
a medium that can be held and held onto -- rather than via cold computer 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these nouveau publishers are rebelling, say the few who actually study 
zines, against a mainstream media that neither takes their lives into 
consideration nor represents them in any fashion, a media they could not crack 
even if they wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, personal zines help fill a gap by committing to paper the 
details of daily life in the late 20th Century, an era nearly devoid of the 
"personal documentation" that crowds libraries and provides the raw material of 
history, those yellowing sheets of paper very likely headed "Dear Diary," "Dear 
Mom," "My Darling." 
</P>
<P>
 Personal zines "are great historically," said Billie Aul, senior librarian 
with the New York State Library, which houses one of the few official zine 
collections in the country. "From the Civil War we have generals' letters to 
their wives, what they were doing and what they were thinking. You don't get 
that stuff from the late 20th Century. Personal zines could bridge that gap at 
least to some extent." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all publishers and readers view zines through such a lofty lens: "We 
publish for no reason at all , not even for the exciting promise of being 
endlessly poked and prodded by a bunch of culture vampires (reporters) wanting 
to know how our fabously morose 20-something lives are turning out," writes 
"Your friend, Jeff" in the foreword to his "X Magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who read personal zines often have a touch of the voyeur or, perhaps, 
soap opera addict, tuning in regularly for more minute details in the lives of 
people they have never met, in cities they may have never seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "With zines you get all the dirty office gossip without any of the involvement 
. . . or risk," said Lee Wochner, 31, who emigrated from southern New Jersey to 
Burbank in 1988 with three close friends -- the same people with whom he writes 
"L.A. Gang Bang." "It's the perfect '90s pastime." 
</P>
<P>
 Personal zines are but one in the zine pantheon. These small, independent 
publications trace their roots at least to the newsletters put out by ardent 
science fiction fans in the 1950s. Depending on how academic you want to be -- 
and most zine makers do not want to be at all -- zines' parentage could stretch 
back to Marcel Duchamp and the Dadaist manifestoes of the early 1900s or even 
to Thomas Paine and his 1776 pamphlet "Common Sense." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole American press in Colonial times was a zine because they were 
outside of the Europeans," said Aul, whose zine collection was donated by Mike 
Gunderloy, founder of Factsheet 5, which is the newsprint bible of the zine 
world. "They were not in the mainstream of intellectual thought. Once the 
revolution happened, it got legitimized. . . . Zines go in and out of the 
mainstream depending on what's going on in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Sassy magazine, which caters to teen-age girls, runs a monthly column 
about zines. Gunderloy's encyclopedic "The World of Zines" was published by 
Penguin Books, the folks who bring you Shakespeare. And in Frederick 
Barthelme's latest novel, "The Brothers," one character puts out a terrorzine, 
a compilation of stories with a certain sick quality that are pasted up and 
photocopied. 
</P>
<P>
 Zines range in topic from the mundane (work) to the bizarre (filk music). 
Although a quick flip through the thousand or so zine reviews in each Factsheet 
5 reveals many zine-makers' obsessions with conspiracy theories and serial 
killers, the fastest-growing zine categories are "queer zines, music zines and 
riot grrrlzines," said R. Seth Friedman, publisher of Factsheet 5, which 
appears several times a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Factsheet 5 sometimes sounds like it's written in a language other than 
English. And, no, it does not come with a glossary. But if you are reading it, 
chances are you already know that queer is the label used by many publishers of 
gay-themed zines, that filk music refers to songs written by sci-fi fans and 
that riot grrrlz are the secretive young members of a new brand of feminism and 
often practitioners of a particularly angry form of rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't know this, you probably should not be reading Friedman's zine 
about zines. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all things alternative, it is hard to gauge just how many zines of any 
stripe are hurtling through the mail or stacking up in record shops and 
bookstores. Friedman pegs the number at 20,000 to 50,000 nationally -- up from 
10,000 a year ago -- of which 500 are personal zines. Others agree with his 
overall numbers but argue that anywhere from a quarter to half of all zines 
could be considered personal. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's tri-state area has long had a flourishing zine culture, Friedman 
said, and Southern California has its share, but "Seattle, Austin and San 
Francisco really kick butt" in terms of number of zines per capita. Those 
cities, he said, have the three ingredients necessary to make them meccas of 
alternative publishing: They have colleges, large transient populations and 
high numbers of young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who make zines are younger, educated, move around, want to stay in 
touch," Friedman said. "A person who stays in an area won't make a zine, 
because they still have their friends (around them) to keep in touch with." 
</P>
<P>
 And they often -- but not always -- have access to a personal computer; the 
growth and ease of desktop publishing is one reason that the number of zines 
continues to grow. In addition to printed and photocopied zines (purists make 
illicit copies on the boss's machine at their day jobs), a technologically 
savvy generation also publishes them via personal computer, CD-ROM, audiotapes 
and videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
 But personal zines are rarely so Space Age in execution and are just as likely 
to be written in Ackworth, N.H., population 776, as San Francisco, population 
723,000. They are an egalitarian and accessible form of communication designed, 
Friedman said, by people who feel isolated and want to connect, people who have 
a message not necessarily suited to mainstream media. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recently moved to southern CAL and I'm feeling isolated, bored, lonely and 
wanting to meet rad dorky egghead kinda girls," writes Tammy Rae Carland in the 
debut issue of "I Amy Carter." Her solution to this conundrum is her zine, 
which also gives her a forum in which to deconstruct her childhood in a Maine 
welfare family, grapple with her sexual assault, find a safe vehicle to discuss 
her "coming out as queer," her "never fitting in." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Pembleton, 27, like many personal zine-makers a self-professed outsider, 
"rebelled a long time ago and just never came back. . . . I still do not 
belong." He's an anarchist, a carpenter, a musician, a Chicago resident and a 
man with a strong need to communicate but a touch of confusion about just what 
to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to make a zine," he recounted of his pre-publishing days, "and it had 
to be a personal zine. I had nothing I wanted to say in a zine. But I thought, 
'Gosh, my mom does.' " And he had it all in writing, letter after letter from 
Suzette to her boy, Lee, the son who detached himself from his family sometime 
after his seventh birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lee first published "Mom" -- a photocopied bimonthly compendium of 
Suzette's wit and wisdom, photographs, postcards and drawings -- Mom did not 
know it. Now she does and approves, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom 2" begins: "Lee Lee! Happy Easter! Here's a bag of goodies from the 
Easter Bunny. . . . I love my fanzine. . . . Although I liked reading the first 
letter I wrote to you, I hated the rest of my writing, really stupid & 
pretentious. I do like my photos tho. Mostly I like you. Love, Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 Publishing "Mom" is a form of therapy for Pembleton, a way to heal some wounds 
of his childhood. It is also "a way of communicating that is really special," 
he says. "It's getting an emotional connection and communicating with other 
people, although I don't know them." 
</P>
<P>
 Family also turned Maddalena Polletta into a zine-writing outsider, but the 
disease in her household was physical rather than emotional -- her mother's 
pancreatic cancer. Polletta, who teaches New York City children to garden by 
day and is an artist by night, wishes she had had a map book to steer her 
through the stages of her mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not know then that it was all right to be callous and bitter and angry 
at the woman wasting away in front of her. She didn't know then, she said, that 
"it's OK to be ugly and mean." 
</P>
<P>
 When her mother died two years ago, Polletta published "Nine Months After 
Diagnosis," a personal zine in the form of a chapbook, a delicate pamphlet 
graced with melancholy woodblock prints, poetry masquerading as prose, and a 
photographic timeline of her mother from '50s glamour girl in wide cinch belt 
and full skirt to cancer patient in a hospital bed. She has bartered, sold or 
given away 400 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear is the thing," Polletta wrote. "I am afraid of the growing revulsion I 
feel towards my mother. She retches all the time. She sleeps in her clothes. 
She is addicted to painkillers. I love her. I don't want to be mean. Sometimes 
I confuse her with the disease." 
</P>
<P>
 While Polletta's readers get a guide to grieving, subscribers to "L.A. Gang 
Bang" get minutiae, the simplest and often funniest details in the lives of 
four transplanted New Jersey-ites: Lee Wochner, 31, playwright; Gary Grasso, 
29, actor/waiter; Mary McGuire, 29, film company executive assistant/stage 
producer, and Valorie Kurtz, 28, respiratory therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gang Bang" is one of the oldest running personal zines around, with an 
international circulation of about 300 and a monthly cost of $1. In addition to 
printing a monthly update from each of the four, it includes letters from 
readers -- most of them addressed to McGuire. "Mary is a young single woman in 
Los Angeles," is Wochner's explanation. "For people around the country, say, 
Kansas, there's a romance to that." 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, too, particularly a certain prison, which housed a certain inmate 
who was a quick draw with the ballpoint pen and engaged in a yearlong 
epistolary battle with McGuire. His beef? Her dating habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me I should lighten up and not be such a man-hater," McGuire 
recounted -- a letter, which, of course, was faithfully printed in the zine. 
"One woman wrote in to say who's he to tell you how to live your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, a prison inmate would be a logical reader for a personal zine, 
someone for whom anyone's life would be at least something of a distraction. 
But in five years, "Gang Bang" has had only three incarcerated subscribers; the 
rest of its readers most likely have their own lives and little need to live 
vicariously through Lee, Gary, Valorie and Mary. But they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon Davidoff, an instructor in the department of popular culture at 
Bowling Green State University in Ohio, contends that people read personal 
zines because they need both family and titillation. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like inserting themselves into other people's lives," he said. "People 
enjoy being voyeurs, whether they admit it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 And the people who write, print, staple and mail these publications? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no need for the world to find out about their minds. But there's a 
need for them to put these out. They write about their dreams and hopes and 
aspirations. Even if someone thinks you're pathetic, they pay you money to read 
about your life." In Their Own Words 
</P>
<P>
 Low-budget and obviously self-published, "zines" vary wildly in circulation 
and quality. What unites zines -- a sort of international postal salon -- is 
their intimate nature, their baring of information formerly penned in the 
privacy of family and friendships. Some excerpts: 
</P>
<P>
 From "Dishwasher" 
</P>
<P>
 "The following week, my night to work arrived and I was just too lazy to go. . 
. . So I stayed at home and assumed they would assume my lack of presence meant 
I quit since that's what I assumed. And it felt good. Jobs are for quitting. 
You get a job, do it for a spell, then quit and it feels good. These are my 
'values' which I used to think differed from my dad's but I don't think so 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 From "Seamonkeys From Guatemala" 
</P>
<P>
 "I am eighteen and don't feel confident or decisive enough to decide whether 
to get a six or nine piece chicken nugget at McDonald's; I can't imagine myself 
deciding to spend the next four years trapped in the Army with only an M-16 to 
keep me company. But the Army thinks it's just peachy that 17 year old kids are 
making this kind of commitment (ironically, often BECAUSE they don't know what 
else to do.)" 
</P>
<P>
 ALL ABOUT ZINES 
</P>
<P>
 * Authors: Although women and men of all stripes publish zines, they are more 
likely to be mobile, in their 20s and live in college towns. In general they 
tend to be urban. 
</P>
<P>
 * Circulation: Finding zines can be tough. Some are sold through record stores 
and alternative book stores. Many are listed and reviewed in Factsheet 5, the 
zine bible, which publishes price and ordering information. Many are bartered, 
given out in coffee houses or handed out to friends. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technique: Low-tech zines can be handwritten and photocopied. High-tech 
zines can be created through sophisticated desk-top publishing. Some are 
electronic, and others are done on CD-ROM.

USE OF FETUS EGGS FOR FERTILITY SPARKS FUROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another controversy over fertilization techniques erupted in Britain on Sunday 
amid reports that a method of producing test-tube babies using eggs from 
aborted fetuses is on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers said the technique, which has sparked intense ethical debate, may 
be able to produce a human baby within three years if the British Medical 
Assn.'s ethics committee gives it the go-ahead as expected next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The technique, pioneered by Dr. Roger Gosden at Edinburgh Medical School, 
would retrieve eggs from aborted female fetuses, fertilize them and place them 
in women who are unable to conceive because of early menopause or illness. 
Gosden has had positive results in the procedure using laboratory mice and 
mouse fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest developments in fertility come after a 59-year-old woman gave birth 
to twins in a London clinic after undergoing artificial fertilization in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Many doctors and officials argued that women past menopause are unsuitable to 
become mothers because of the vast age difference between them and their 
offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a British fertility clinic was embroiled in another controversy 
over implanting a white woman's egg into a black woman, after reports that the 
woman and her husband, a man of mixed race, wanted to ensure the color of their 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest case, the thought of creating infants from the eggs of mothers 
who have never been born has caused some controversy in the medical and 
political worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Member of Parliament David Alton, a Liberal Democrat, called the new treatment 
"reminiscent of grave-robbing." 
</P>
<P>
 "This consumerist approach to the creation of life," he said, "puts it on a 
par with an American fast-food outlet." 
</P>
<P>
 A report on the research in the Sunday Express newspaper also raised the 
specter of "fetus farming," in which women would conceive babies, have 
abortions and sell their fetuses for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prof. Stuart Campbell, head of obstetrics at King's College Hospital in 
London, said, "Non-medical moralists who sound off don't see the desperation of 
infertile couples." 
</P>
<P>
 The government's in-vitro fertility watchdog group, the Human Fertilization 
and Embryology Authority, is studying the research. 
</P>
<P>
 Gosden claims that experiments in mice show that eggs from fetuses can be 
successfully implanted into infertile animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers say that the ovaries of a human female fetus can have up to 5 
million eggs; the number of eggs gradually diminishes after birth, and by the 
age of 50 most women have fewer than 1,000, British news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, there is a shortage of women's eggs because there are so few 
donors, medical experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am certain the technique can be transferred to humans," Gosden told the 
Sunday Express. "With ethical permission, the first human baby using the 
procedure could be born within three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers said the technique raises legal questions, such as what would 
happen if a woman decided she had a legal right to her fetus's fertilized egg 
in another woman's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are creating some nightmare scenarios in the next century," psychiatrist 
Anthony Clare said. "People will be growing up whose mothers were aborted 
fetuses. I'd be very interested to know what the mothers intend to tell their 
children when they grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kieran Conrey of the Catholic Media Office, "Any interference in natural 
procreation is considered unwelcome by the church." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bishop Hugh Montefiore, ex-chairman of the Church of England's Board of 
Social Responsibility, said, "I can see nothing wrong in the new procedure. But 
there must be safeguards. Written consent of both parents of the fetus must be 
obtained." 
</P>
<P>
 Most fertility doctors in Britain welcomed news of the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is tremendous news," said Dr. Peter Brinsden of Bourn Hall Clinic in 
Cambridge. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dr. Stuart Horner, chairman of the medical association's ethics committee, 
declared, "We have not found any major ethical objection."

ALASKA PROCEEDS WITH KILLING WOLVES -- TO A HOWL OF PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the great spruce forests south of here, the state of Alaska has begun 
killing wolves by the dozens -- trying to reduce predators and save caribou for 
human hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 To the displeasure of almost everyone involved, the wolves are being slain in 
the worst of ways, causing suffering and social disruption among these highly 
organized and rare creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Political compromise and worry about national reaction have brought Alaska to 
this unhappy pass. A hotblooded clash between hunters, environmentalists and 
animal protectionists is now also a tale about the fickle attention of the news 
media and the tortuous maneuverings by both sides to shape public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 As of this week, 65 wolves, mostly young animals, have been slain by Alaska 
Department of Fish and Game trappers. The animals are lured by the bait of 
moose and caribou carcasses and then choked in preset neck snares. If they 
don't die in the snares, they are shot to death on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's goal is to eliminate 100 to 150 wolves, or 75% to 80% of 
those that roam a 4,030-square-mile area between Fairbanks and Denali National 
Park to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 With rolling forests and foothills spread across an area bigger than 
Connecticut, this area was once popular with caribou hunters from Fairbanks. 
But the local caribou herd, which numbered 10,700 four years ago, has dropped 
to 4,000 head, and, as a result, hunting of caribou has been prohibited here 
since November, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunters say they believe that predation by wolves and grizzly bears, combined 
with uncommonly harsh winters, has driven down the number of caribou and that 
the animals now need extra protection if they are to rebound quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, opponents say. Caribou herds fluctuate dramatically in size, usually 
without relation to predators, and Alaska's overall caribou population is at 
near record highs, as hunters would find if only they would venture farther 
from roads. 
</P>
<P>
 But the argument is really larger and more fundamental -- a contest for meat 
and dominance, if you will, between those two relentless predators, Canis lupus 
and Homo sapiens . 
</P>
<P>
 Hunters say they believe that Alaska's 5,000 to 7,000 wolves -- which are not 
listed as threatened or endangered here as they are in the Lower 48 -- are 
getting more than a fair share of the caribou and moose everywhere in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists counter that no humans are starving for lack of game, so 
nature should be left largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska stirred up a national stink last winter when it sided with hunters and 
advanced a plan to kill wolves in three large areas within reach of Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time -- and this became a key to events that followed -- the 
Department of Fish and Game proposed tracking radio-collared wolves from the 
air and shooting entire packs at a time. Aerial wolf control had been standard 
fare in the state on and off until the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea aroused national rage, and a tourism boycott by the 
Washington-headquartered Fund for Animals and the Friends of Animals in 
Connecticut, later joined by other groups, sent panic through Alaska's 
political and tourism Establishment. Vacation travel bookings slumped, and 
officials said the wolf kill looked like it might be harder on their industry 
than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Walter J. Hickel stepped in and decreed that there would be no aerial 
wolf control. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and animal protectionists rejoiced. The tourism boycott was 
lifted. Hunters fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Americans, the tale ended there. The national news media retreated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fairbanks-area hunters and trappers appealed to the state Board of Game. 
The panel, which is dominated by hunters and trappers and has a constitutional 
mandate to manage game for public harvest, approved an experimental 
wolf-control program that would rely on snare traps in one of the three large 
tracts. Private hunting and trapping regulations were also liberalized 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Such ground-based trapping is fraught with its own problems, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Government scientists, hunter activists and the opponents of wolf control all 
agree that it is far less desirable than aerial hunting: Shooting generally 
brings a swifter end than strangling in a snare, and aerial hunting allows 
entire packs to be eliminated rather than randomly reducing the numbers in each 
pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Many biologists say they believe that for animals with elaborate communal 
relationships like wolves, taking out packs in their entirety causes the least 
of what humans think of as social disruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are shredding their social structure -- the very thing that makes them 
wolves. We're not talking about just having four-legged canines survive out 
there, but wolves. And what makes them wolves is their very sophisticated 
social structure. That's what sets this species apart," said Gordon Haber, a 
wildlife scientist who has studied wolves for 28 years. He is working under a 
contract with animal protection organizations opposed to the state trapping and 
snaring program. 
</P>
<P>
 Another consideration is that eliminating random wolves rather than entire 
packs may trigger greater breeding among survivors -- as is known to happen 
with coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 This could put the state in the position of having to kill still greater 
numbers of wolves in future years. 
</P>
<P>
 But having fought off aerial hunting last year, opponents of the wolf kill are 
not inclined to embrace it now as a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Biologically it may make more sense (to shoot them from the air). But it's 
like saying: What's the best way to kill a kindergarten class? This is 
absolutely miserable stuff, and I'm just not going to approve any killing at 
all," said Pricilla Feral, whose Friends of Animals group is leading the call 
for a renewed tourism boycott in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the day-by-day argument over the trapping program has become 
a macabre PR fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents want to photograph the dead wolves to spread the pictures across the 
nation; the state responds by skinning the carcasses before allowing anyone to 
view them. The scene is like the back room in a butcher's shop and few, if any, 
pictures, are published as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents cry out in alarm when they learn that state game agents delivered 
the coup de grace to snared and dying wolves with a shot into the side, not to 
the head. This prolongs the suffering of these animals just to preserve the 
skulls for research, opponents charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, replies the state. When agents come across a thrashing wolf in a 
snare, the heart-lung area is a bigger target than the head. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year struggle is generating new frictions within the ranks of both 
hunters and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hunters' groups, such as the Alaska Outdoor Council, strike a temperate 
tone. Dick Bishop, vice president of the council, asks urban Americans to 
consider the "environmental correctness" of the traditional Alaska lifestyle of 
filling the freezer with wild game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Self-sufficiency just makes eminent good sense. There is less impact on the 
environment than buying food and materials through conventional commercial 
sources. Sometimes we have to recognize that it's not the grocery store that 
nourishes us, but it's Mother Earth that nourishes us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other hunters are fed up and are talking tough. They want more reductions 
in predators and more game for hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've half-stepped our way to the edge of the cliff. We can't take another 
step without falling off," said Ralph Seekins, a prominent Fairbanks 
businessman and leader of the militant new Alaska Wildlife Conservation Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Of each year's harvestable surplus of wildlife, he proposes 30% for hunters, 
30% for bears and 30% for wolves, leaving 10% mortality for natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doesn't that seem fair?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, by his count, hunting is responsible for only 2.5% of the mortality of 
moose, sheep and caribou in Alaska. Bears and wolves kill 87.5%, with 10% 
attributable to natural causes. To change the equation would require widespread 
reduction of grizzly bears and wolves, which the association says it will seek 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the wolf kill also find themselves divided. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream environmental organizations are trying to attack the state program 
through changes in federal law and regulation. Recently, they pressured the 
federal Fish and Wildlife Service to prohibit private hunters from using 
aircraft to assist in hunting wolves. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Alaska's overall goal of reducing predators, hunters this winter 
were given the go-ahead to use planes to locate wolves, then land and shoot 
them. The new federal regulations will outlaw this land-and-shoot practice on 
national wildlife refuges. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal protectionists, on the other hand, say that only a renewed tourism 
boycott can stop the wolf kill, and they are critical of those who refuse to 
join. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the strategy has been a lonely crusade by the Friends of Animals, but 
the larger Fund for Animals group promises its own advertising campaign for a 
boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental organizations, by and large, have resisted the boycott approach 
-- chiefly because small ecotourism businesses with pro-conservation leanings 
are the first to be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Alaska Wilderness Recreation and Tourism Assn. says it faces 
devastating consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're angry -- both at the state and the boycotters. We don't have any say in 
this (wolf-control) policy but we're being hurt," said Nancy Lethcoe, president 
of the group. Last year's six-week boycott caused a 10% cut in ecotourism in 
Alaska, she said. This year's bookings through the winter holiday season are 
way down, in some cases as much as 90%. 
</P>
<P>
 But animal protectionists argue that there is no other way to reach Alaska 
policy-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is the only thing the state of Alaska understands," Feral said, 
criticizing environmental organizations, such as the Sierra Club, that are 
sponsoring guided outdoor trips to Alaska in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise lines and bus tours make tourism Alaska's No. 3 employer behind 
government and seafood. The state's Visitors' Bureau reports that it is too 
early to tell whether a boycott will reduce the 1 million or so tourists 
expected in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Executive Director Karen Cowart says, "we expect no less than a 4% 
increase in visitors for 1994."

TOUGH STAND ON ATTENDANCE PAYS OFF AT SOUTH GATE HIGH; EDUCATION: ABSENCES ARE 
CAREFULLY EXAMINED, PARENTS OFTEN CALLED. POLICY HELPS BRING ACADEMIC 
IMPROVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 7 a.m. sharp every school day, South Gate High School Assistant Principal 
James Alther cranks up a finely oiled machine that produces a rare product in 
Los Angeles public schools: thousands of teen-agers who come to school nearly 
every day, hundreds who possess perfect attendance records. 
</P>
<P>
 In one corner of the cafeteria, where Alther sets up shop, two counselors 
armed with computerized student rosters check in the returning sick, the 
ditchers, the I-had-a-doctor's-appointment absences. Another teacher stands 
poised to deal with those who dared to come back without a valid excuse. A 
clerk operates a time punch to record the exact hour of return. 
</P>
<P>
 And Alther -- a man known not to mince words -- commands center stage, 
delivering the same firm message to each student: 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to be here every day," he says over and over. "Every day is 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate High School, an overcrowded campus where most students are poor and 
many do not speak fluent English, has distinguished itself with a near-perfect 
attendance rate, the highest of the Los Angeles Unified School District's 49 
high schools for two years straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Districtwide, high schools had an attendance rate of 83% last year, which 
meant that students on average missed about 31 days of class. On any given day 
at South Gate, 96% of the school's nearly 4,000 students are in their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 With 3% out for bona fide reasons such as illness or funerals, only 1% of 
South Gate students miss school without a valid excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 At South Gate, keeping students in class every day has become a focal point of 
campus administration and has been credited with helping propel a once-troubled 
school to refreshing measures of success. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of South Gate students who are demoted because of academic failure 
has dropped to 7% from 13% four years ago, school records show. The school's 7% 
dropout rate is the second lowest in the district and less than half the 
district average of 16% -- an improvement attributed to both the push to 
increase daily attendance and a dropout prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 Academic achievement is also on the rise. The percentage of South Gate seniors 
who moved on to four-year colleges and universities last fall stands at 29% -- 
nine points above the district average. The campus has one of the most improved 
college attendance rates in the district, rising about 10% over the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school's average score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, an 
influential barometer of achievement, still lags far behind the national 
average, the number of South Gate students who take the college entrance exam 
has nearly doubled over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate's victories are attracting attention at a time when reform-minded 
educators are grasping for solutions to raise student achievement. It stands as 
an example that positive change at urban schools does not happen overnight but 
requires focused and complete support from the principal to the parents -- and 
that such change can transform fundamental attitudes in youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize now that all the days you miss catch up with you -- you fall 
behind, you fail. So you're only hurting yourself," said Jessica Gonzales, 17, 
a senior scrambling to complete graduation requirements because of her high 
absenteeism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows that people care if you are not in class. Even though they are 
strict here, it really does help. I know I couldn't miss work and still keep my 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Boosting attendance also produces revenue for the cash-starved school 
district. Under state laws, districts are paid according to the number of 
students who come to class or have excused absences. Last year, the district 
lost $74.3 million because of unexcused absences. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate High has managed the turnaround with no additional resources, even 
as it has suffered the same stinging staff and education program cutbacks over 
the past four years as the district's other high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 It started with Principal Frank Moreno, a former attendance counselor who 
embraces a simple credo: "Missing one day of school is a great loss," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, when the school's attendance rate was hovering around 85%, 
Moreno directed Alther to make the attendance program his main responsibility. 
No financial planning, athletic oversight or facility maintenance duties for 
this assistant principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Alther devised a no-nonsense policy, high on expectations and low on tolerance 
for scofflaws because "we don't do them any favors if we let them slide," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, parents and students must sign a document that lists acceptable 
and unacceptable reasons for absences from the school, which draws from the 
poor and working class communities of South Gate and surrounding areas and is 
98% Latino. Students attend an assembly where Moreno hammers in the rules. 
Homeroom teachers frequently review them with students. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior privileges are tied to attendance: Eight absences, no football games, 
no prom, no grad night. 
</P>
<P>
 Alther also gives little leeway for sniffles, coughs and colds, a policy that 
riles many students, some of whom complain that they are forced to come to 
school sick out of fear of losing privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are sick if you can't get out of bed," Alther said. "Short of that, come 
to school. Better to have high expectations. . . . Haven't you ever gone to 
work sick?" 
</P>
<P>
 Students with more than three absences must meet with Alther to hear his stern 
warning. "This is it. You can't have anymore absences," Alther told one senior 
girl on a recent morning. "After this we are going to take your privileges." 
</P>
<P>
 "I got sick, OK?" she said sniffling, white tissue in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK. . . ," he said tentatively, "But it's the week before finals, you can't 
be missing school." 
</P>
<P>
 By 11 a.m. each day, two school clerks make phones calls to the parent of 
every absent student. And while mom or dad is on the line, they review the 
student's latest grades. 
</P>
<P>
 When students with shaky attendance records return to school, they face an 
immediate telephone parent conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your daughter was absent yesterday, did you know that?" clerk Leticia 
Gonzalez said to one mother recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Long pause. The 17-year-old girl stood by, nervously shaking her leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's missed 12 days total and is failing three classes, did you know that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Longer pause. Then the mother explained that her daughter had tonsillitis and 
she could not get her to the doctor. The clerk said that if the mother could 
not obtain medical care for the girl on her own, the student could see the 
school nurse immediately. Tonsillitis would not keep this girl out for extended 
days again, the clerk said victoriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how cooperative parents can be," Gonzalez said. "Once they know 
what is happening and understand what they can do, most are glad we are 
concerned and on top of things." 
</P>
<P>
 The student rolled her eyes. "They don't let you get away with anything here," 
she muttered as she turned to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 When phone calls fail to bring improvement, Alther calls parents in for a 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning, he reprimanded a mother for scheduling a family Christmas 
vacation to Mexico during finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say this is OK to do. We want your daughter here to take finals," 
Alther said through Gonzalez, who translated into Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother explained that she had prepaid plane tickets and a family first 
Communion party to attend there. Alther countered that the school calendar is 
handed out early in the year to avoid such conflicts. The absence, he said, 
will be unexcused and the girl will be in danger of losing senior privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, the teen-ager reported to class to take her finals. Somehow 
the vacation had been rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Four hundred of South Gate's students achieved perfect attendance last year. 
Their reward was a tiny pin, seeing their names posted on a bulletin board and 
heaps of praise from teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pride among most students is mammoth.

NEW U.S. ATTY. SETS AGENDA FOR L.A. OFFICE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: NORA M. MANELLA 
PLANS TO INCREASE COMMUNITY OUTREACH. 'THERE IS NO HIGHER PRIORITY THAT ANY 
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE CAN HAVE THAN INSTILLING A SENSE OF ETHICS,' SHE SAYS.

<P>
 A new era begins today in the U.S. attorney's office as former Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Nora M. Manella takes the reins, vowing to use her 185 
lawyers to crack down on environmental crime, illegal weapons trafficking and 
scams directed at the poor while emphasizing the ethical responsibilities of 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in more than a decade, the top federal law enforcement 
official in seven Southern California counties, stretching from San Bernardino 
to San Luis Obispo, will be a prosecutor appointed by a Democratic president. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous responsibility and I hope a tremendous opportunity to make 
a positive impact on civil and criminal law enforcement" in the most populous 
judicial district in the nation, Manella said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she said she was "impressed" by the lawyers in the office, Manella -- 
who served as an assistant U.S. attorney here from 1982-90 -- made it clear 
that there will be changes, some prompted by new Justice Department policies 
giving U.S. attorneys greater discretion to decide the severity of criminal 
charges filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Manella said she was particularly pleased that Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has 
scrapped guidelines set down by former Atty. Gen. Richard L. Thornburgh that 
directed federal prosecutors to lodge the most severe charges they could and 
take a very hard line in regard to plea bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some defend the soundness of that approach, numerous critics have 
said the policy was so rigid that many cases went to trial needlessly because 
defendants felt they had nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I welcome the opportunity to use the discretion we have been given," Manella 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Manella, who has sent plenty of people to prison as a prosecutor and 
judge, stressed that her willingness to use discretion did not mean she would 
be soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Hollywood High School, Wellesley College and USC Law School, 
Manella also said that she planned to increase the office's community outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the last 12 years, not a lot has been done to tell people around the 
country that U.S. attorneys' offices are there to vindicate the rights of all, 
not just the wealthy or the temporarily dispossessed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, she credited her predecessor, former U.S. Atty. Terree A. 
Bowers, for increasing outreach, and lavishly praised the work of federal 
prosecutors in the successful case against Los Angeles police officers who 
violated the civil rights of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some cases so important both because of the merits and symbolically 
that even though difficult they must be brought," Manella said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The King case was a perfect example -- a case too important to be ignored by 
the federal government, especially when we were talking about the vindication 
of federally protected rights as a result of overreaching by law enforcement 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Manella also stressed that it was important for her "to inspire people in the 
office to be the best, not just in terms of legal proficiency but also of moral 
probity." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no higher priority that any prosecutor's office can have than 
instilling a sense of ethics and moral probity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She took pains to say she was not criticizing anyone or making any judgments 
about the training lawyers in the office have received. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, her remarks came in the wake of a recent blistering critique of 
the U.S. attorney's office here by a federal appeals court that reversed a 
narcotics conviction because of a prosecutor's ethical violation -- concealing 
significant information from the defense. The judges lambasted the prosecutor's 
superiors for failing to properly supervise him and for failing to acknowledge 
the extent of his misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as significant as Manella's ascendancy is the retirement of Robert L. 
Brosio, chief of the criminal division in the office for more than a 
quarter-century. Brosio played a key role in setting policy, hiring, deciding 
whether cases should be filed and serving as the office's institutional memory. 
</P>
<P>
 He rarely talked to reporters but acknowledged in a relaxed moment last year 
that while serving under a dozen U.S. attorneys he had signed more indictments 
"than anyone in the history of the republic." He quipped: "I think my record 
has a better chance of standing than Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak 
because people have a good reason to challenge his record." 
</P>
<P>
 "It saddens me to lose Bob Brosio," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven D. 
Clymer, one of the lead prosecutors in the King case. "He shaped the office. He 
made it what it is -- as good a legal office as you will find in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Clymer predicted a smooth transition because the three people who will 
be leading the office -- Manella, her chief assistant Steve Zipperstein, 34, 
and Richard Drooyan, 43, Brosio's replacement -- all have served in the office 
in prominent roles. Manella and Zipperstein served as head of the office's 
appellate unit. Drooyan was chief assistant from 1984-1988 under U.S. Atty. 
Robert Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
 Zipperstein, a white-collar crime specialist, has been on temporary special 
assignment in Washington D.C. for the past 18 months as counsel to the 
assistant attorney general for the criminal division. Drooyan, who specialized 
in public corruption cases as a prosecutor, has been in private practice in 
civil litigation in Los Angeles in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Drooyan was one of 13 contenders to become the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles 
after Bowers, who spent a decade as a federal prosecutor and is now a candidate 
to serve on a special Justice Department team that will be investigating war 
crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy screening process, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) 
recommended Manella for the $113,500-a-year job and President Clinton nominated 
her. She was confirmed by the Senate in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Manella is a Democrat, there will not be immediate dramatic shifts 
because the office traditionally has operated on a nonpartisan basis, said 
Loyola University law professor Laurie Levenson, who preceded Manella as head 
of the U.S. attorney's appellate unit in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you will see changes," Levenson said. "I think that this office will 
reach out even more to the community and not be locked in to priorities that 
were set before." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Manella said the office will continue to prosecute complex 
white-collar crimes, defense fraud, major narcotics violations and health care 
swindles because those are appropriate cases for federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said it is important for her to come up with some creative approaches 
to how federal prosecutors can make an impact on violent crime, without 
tripping over local authorities who have the primary responsibility in this 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a second district attorney's office," she said. "They file maybe 
60,000 cases a year and we do maybe a thousand . . . We can't do every 
carjacking." 
</P>
<P>
 One new priority might be greater concentration on illegal weapons 
trafficking. "I would be delighted" to bring more cases of this type, Manella 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proliferation of guns is one of the main contributors to violent crime. . 
. . I can think of few areas where our resources could be better spent." 
</P>
<P>
 Though she said she has a "huge mandate" as the U.S. attorney, Manella will 
have to make some tough choices about launching new initiatives because she 
will be operating with diminished resources. The office's authorized strength 
is 215 attorneys, but it has never had that many and now has 185 lawyers, down 
from a peak of 206 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles has been understaffed for years, 
considering the size of the area for which it has responsibility. There is one 
lawyer for every 91,000 residents, compared to one lawyer for every 25,000 
residents in the Manhattan office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Gary Condit (D-Ceres) recently called on the attorney general to take 
corrective action about the staffing pattern, which he said resulted in the 
U.S. attorney's office in California having to turn down 46% of the major bank 
and thrift fraud cases referred by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its relatively small size, the office has long been considered one of 
the most prestigious in the country and has won a number of big cases recently. 
Still, there has been mounting criticism from criminal defense lawyers, such as 
Barry Tarlow, that younger lawyers in the office are increasingly using "the 
same kind of hardball tactics that have become so prominent in civil 
litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Also troubling have been scolding comments from U.S. District Judge Terry J. 
Hatter Jr. that the office does not have nearly enough ethnic minorities in 
positions of authority and that young white prosecutors were making their 
reputations on the backs of minority defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Manella said the office should do better on diversity issues, but said it has 
been hampered by a hiring freeze. One of her first acts was to elevate an 
experienced Asian-American prosecutor, Jean A. Kawahara, to head the office's 
Orange County branch, and to elevate two other women to ranking positions in 
the civil division. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, her first two picks for her key assistants were white males 
-- Drooyan and Zipperstein. Manella indicated that she would bring minorities 
and women into greater positions of responsibility, including key roles in big 
cases, which would make them more likely candidates for important supervisorial 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The office reflected for years a prior ethos of the old-boy network," Manella 
said. "You don't change that overnight."

DIXY LEE RAY, FORMER HEAD OF U.S. ATOMIC AGENCY, DIES; POLITICS: THE OUTSPOKEN 
EX-GOVERNOR OF WASHINGTON STATE WAS KNOWN FOR HER SUPPORT OF THE NUCLEAR 
INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dixy Lee Ray, former chairwoman of the Atomic Energy Commission and Washington 
state governor, died Sunday at her home on Fox Island. She was 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Ray had suffered from a severe bronchial condition for several months, 
said KIRO-TV commentator Lou Guzzo, a longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Ray showed her mettle early. At 12, she became the youngest girl to climb 
Mt. Rainier, Washington's highest peak, located between Seattle and her Tacoma 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, at 62, she was sworn in as the state's first woman governor 
-- the only one so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm a late bloomer," the Democrat quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 An outspoken supporter of the nuclear industry, she headed the Atomic Energy 
Commission from 1973-75. She served a single term as governor from 1977 to 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Ray issued her last no-nonsense commentary on nuclear issues Thursday, 
when she dismissed media reports about past federal radiation experiments as 
alarmist. She also took Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary to task for "blaming all 
of her predecessors for things she says are terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is exposed to radiation. . . . A little bit more or a little bit 
less is of no consequence," Miss Ray said in an interview with the Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
 She also had no patience for environmentalists she considered too strident. 
She and Guzzo, who was her policy adviser when she was governor, co-authored 
two books on the subject, "Trashing the Planet" in 1990 and "Environmental 
Overkill" in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Never one for artifice, Miss Ray set tongues wagging in 1972, when President 
Richard Nixon appointed her to the AEC and she startled observers in 
Washington, D.C., by living in a motor home and taking her dogs to work. 
</P>
<P>
 When the AEC was phased out, she was named assistant secretary of state, 
overseeing the Bureau of Oceans, International Environment and Scientific 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Ray returned to Washington state in 1975, complaining that former 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger had given her the cold shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Her straightforward political style frequently ruffled feathers. When she 
succeeded Gov. Dan Evans and dismissed virtually his entire Administration, 
promising "change, change, change," a public outcry followed. She dismissed 
that, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one owns a job," she said. "From now on, we'll send them a Kleenex at the 
time they're fired if they're going to be a crybaby." 
</P>
<P>
 She battled with reporters throughout her term, complaining that they were 
"bitten with the bug of cynicism" and unfair to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Her popularity plummeted over the four years, and she failed to win her 
party's nomination for reelection in 1980. She blamed the media for her defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Her candor while in office was considered refreshing by many, and her fiscally 
conservative approach to government had supporters. A Boeing Co. lobbyist 
called her "the best friend business ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Miss Ray was named a director of American Ecology Corp., a toxic 
waste management firm based in Agoura Hills. Ironically, while governor she had 
shut down one of the company's low-level nuclear waste dumps in Washington 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 She did so, she later told The Times, because "the people who generate the 
waste weren't packaging it properly." But the company itself, she said, was not 
to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 In her later years, Miss Ray also served as a consultant to the U.S. 
Department of Energy and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 A short, chunky woman with cropped hair and tailored clothes, Miss Ray was 
born Sept. 3, 1914, in Tacoma, one of five girls. Christened Margaret, she was 
called Dick as a child -- short for "that little Dickens." She renamed herself 
after a favorite region and a Civil War general. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Ray never married. 
</P>
<P>
 She earned her undergraduate degree at Mills College and a doctorate in 
zoology at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
 Before entering public life, she was an associate professor of zoology at the 
University of Washington for 27 years and director of the Pacific Science 
Center for nine years.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; THE NUCLEAR PROTESTER WHO WON'T GIVE UP; MANY AROUND SAN LUIS 
OBISPO HAVE COME TO AN UNEASY PEACE WITH THE DIABLO CANYON POWER PLANT. BUT ONE 
WOMAN, WHO WAS FIRED FOR REFUSING TO TAKE CHILDREN TO A MARINE LAB THERE, 
CONTINUES HER OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It used to be a Central Coast symbol of evil, the site of weeks-long blockades 
and celebrity-studded demonstrations as protesters struck out against a 
perceived threat to the environment and human safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant in Avila Beach is the site of far 
different demonstrations, ones sanctioned by the county superintendent of 
schools and aimed at teaching children about the ocean and the environment in a 
marine biology laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 In little more than a decade, San Luis Obispo and the small, graceful cities 
on this crescent of coastline have come to an uneasy peace with the massive 
plant. For many former protesters here, P G & E -- the plant's owner -- is 
still far from an atomic ally, but economic necessity and political burnout 
have thinned the ranks of the anti-nuclear faithful and muted their cries. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving Kathy DiPeri pretty much alone. 
</P>
<P>
 DiPeri was arrested in 1981, along with singer Jackson Browne and hundreds of 
others protesting the nuclear power plant. She was arrested again in August, 
one of only 13 who landed in jail after a Hiroshima Day rally at Diablo Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 She lost her job over her beliefs, for her refusal to take children from the 
county-run environmental camp where she worked to the marine biology lab at the 
nuclear power plant. No job, she says, should require a woman to betray her 
morals, her religion. A judge agreed in September; the county superintendent of 
schools appealed in November. DiPeri is still unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have lost faith in being activists," said the soft-spoken 
35-year-old. "I don't like to lose faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Carol Loomis, another 1981 Diablo Canyon arrestee, said DiPeri is in "a 
really lonely place" these days. Loomis supports DiPeri's stand, she says, but 
she just cannot bring herself to fight what she considers the good fight 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one had spoken up (against Diablo Canyon) for a very long time," Loomis 
said. "Kathy took this stand. I think it was phenomenal. . . . But I don't do 
that anymore. I totally burned out on it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, thousands of fifth- and sixth-graders from school districts 
throughout San Luis Obispo County spend anywhere from one to five days at 
Rancho El Chorro. They learn about the Chumash Indians who once populated the 
rolling, oak-dotted hills that rise above San Luis Obispo Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 They hike the hillsides and chart the wildflowers, watch the bobcats and study 
the pond water, get a hands-on look at nature, what protects it, what destroys 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want the kids to be able to do is access (nature) and appreciate it, 
look at it and leave it," said Linda Shephard, county superintendent of 
schools. "I think the way to do that is to get their hands on it." 
</P>
<P>
 One gap in the program, Shephard said, was the discipline of sea life and 
marine biology. The camp where DiPeri worked as an environmental interpreter 
had a pond but "was at the mercy of the tides" when it came to studying tide 
pools, Shephard said. She approached P G & E to help out; trips to the nuclear 
power plant and its lab with tanks of sea stars and anemones became a part of 
the Rancho El Chorro program two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before DiPeri began to protest. For starters, she did not 
believe that a trip to the local nuclear power plant was safe for her students. 
And she could not fathom P G & E as an environmental educator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moral concern I have is I don't want to participate in lying to kids and 
making them think a corporation that's desecrating the environment is doing a 
good thing for the environment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After going to her union for advice, DiPeri filed a letter of protest but 
continued to take her charges to Diablo Canyon. Several co-workers offered to 
take her place on the power plant excursions, she said, but her supervisors 
would not allow it. Finally, she refused to go at all and eventually was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she sued to get her job back -- and won -- she has yet to return to 
work because her victory has been appealed. She has been unemployed for 1 1/2 
years, a time she spent in part trying to run a small farm -- without great 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Shephard would not talk about the DiPeri case, but she defended the 
environmental education program and the schools' relationship with P G & E. "We 
felt it was a good partnership and an integral part of the program," Shephard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DiPeri has taken her case to school districts throughout the county. Although 
she has received some quiet support from parents and PTA presidents, her 
efforts have been to little avail. She blames politics -- and economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill ZamEk, an active member of the anti-nuclear group Mothers for Peace, 
concurs. ZamEk has spent 18 months working against P G & E's efforts to renew 
Diablo Canyon's license; she, too, was arrested in 1981, and left the area for 
a year when the nuclear power plant began operating. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of fighting the school district, it's important but uncomfortable," 
ZamEk said. "I have a job with the school district. There's only so much you 
can do without being fired." 
</P>
<P>
 For those with less of a political bent, the decision becomes easier when P G 
& E's community involvement is taken into consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 San Luis Obispo County is home to 230,000 people, 3% to 4% of whom work for 
the power company. P G & E is the biggest private employer in the county, the 
company says, and pays among the highest wages. It also is a major benefactor, 
giving money and in-kind assistance to the schools, the children's museum and 
other institutions that are strapped in these recessionary times. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Hennessy, manager of P G & E's Los Padres Division -- which includes 
Diablo Canyon -- contends that the company does not do more community outreach 
here than other places it operates, and does not try to compensate for running 
a nuclear power plant. 
</P>
<P>
 He says it's not necessary. The plant has operated safely since 1985, he says, 
and the community does not seem concerned. "This community over the last 10 
years has had a tremendous influx from Southern California," he said. 
"Culturally, the area has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Not totally. For her part, DiPeri sees her court battle as a victory and plans 
to press on in her fight against Diablo Canyon and the county schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want back pay, about $10,000," she said. "I want my job back. And I want 
them to stop sending kids to the power plant."

CESAR ROMERO, SUAVE STAR FOR OVER 60 YEARS, DIES AT 86; HOLLYWOOD: THE ACTOR'S 
CAREER SPANNED STAGE, FILMS AND TV. HE REMAINED SOCIALLY PROMINENT IN 
RETIREMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cesar Romero, the classically handsome, debonair Latin Lothario of stage, film 
and television for nearly seven decades and an omnipresence on the Hollywood 
social circuit long after he had given up acting, has died. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero died Saturday night at St. Johns Hospital and Health Center in Santa 
Monica, according to hospital spokesman Gary Miereanu. Romero, who had been 
hospitalized with severe bronchitis and pneumonia, died of complications of a 
blood clot, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 To younger audiences, the enduring and versatile Romero was most familiar as 
the Joker in the television series "Batman" in the mid-1960s and opposite Jane 
Wyman as matriarch Angela Channing's husband, Peter Stavros, on "Falcon Crest" 
from 1985 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he began on Broadway, Romero was probably better known for the dozen 
or so musical comedy films he made for 20th Century Fox in the 1930s to 1950s 
opposite such stars as Alice Faye and Betty Grable, and for his role as the 
Cisco Kid in a series of films. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero began his career as a nightclub dancer, and throughout his life was 
regarded as Hollywood's most desirable dancing partner at parties as well as on 
stage or screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had plenty of clothes and no money," he once told The Times, explaining 
how he became an elegant gate-crasher in order to enjoy dinner dances and 
Broadway theater as a young man in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero was born there, the son of machinery exporter Cesar Julio Romero and 
singer Maria Mantilla, and liked to refer to himself as "a Latin from 
Manhattan." 
</P>
<P>
 "If his business hadn't gone broke, I'd be exporting nuts, bolts and sugar 
machinery right now," he told The Times in 1965. "What an awful thought!" 
</P>
<P>
 Romero's maternal grandfather was Jose Marti, the Cuban patriot and martyr for 
whom Havana's airport is named. The entertainer was the guest of honor in 1965 
when New York unveiled its Central Park statue of Marti. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, a lifelong bachelor, segued easily from stage to screen to television 
to dinner theater and private dinner parties partially because of his perennial 
good looks. In 1965, The Times' now-retired arts editor, Charles Champlin, 
observed that "Mr. Romero seems to have access to the same anti-age potion as 
Cary Grant." 
</P>
<P>
 Active until quite recently, Romero helped serve Thanksgiving dinners to the 
homeless at the Los Angeles Mission on Skid Row and was on the celebrity guest 
list for the opening night of Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard" Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 86 and my doctor used to tell me to slow down -- at least he did until he 
dropped dead," Romero quipped to a Toronto newspaper last summer. "But we 
Latins make splendid lovers and splendid older men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't date women my own age any more -- I hate going to cemeteries," he 
joked. "So I look for the younger breed. I take them dining and dancing and by 
the end of an evening they're bushwhacked, whereas I still want to go on to the 
next nightclub." 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to Romero's suave image, his Hollywood friends and his family usually 
called him Butch. 
</P>
<P>
 "George Murphy tagged that name on me years ago," he explained. "We were all 
at a party and he went around tagging names on people that didn't fit them. I 
was tall and skinny and had black hair and played gigolos and he said: 'Your 
name is Butch.' Everyone laughed and it stuck." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero made his stage debut as a dancer in the 1927 New York show "Lady Do," 
and his Broadway debut as Ricci in the 1932 play "Dinner at Eight," which ran 
for more than 300 performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Other plays included "Stella Brady," "All Points West," "Spring in Autumn," 
"Ten Minute Alibi" and "Mr. Barry's Etchings." He toured as the Count di Ruvo 
in "Strictly Dishonorable." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to Hollywood, Romero made his film debut as Jorgensen in "The Thin Man" 
in 1934. Other early films in the 1930s included "British Agent," "Show Them No 
Mercy," "Metropolitan," "Love Before Breakfast," "Wee Willie Winkie," "Happy 
Landing," "My Lucky Star," the Cisco Kid series and "The Gay Caballero." 
</P>
<P>
 In his mid-30s when World War II broke out, Romero interrupted his long string 
of films for three years service in the U.S. Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm satisfied to go in at the bottom -- that's the best way to learn what 
things are all about," he said when he enlisted at the Long Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero became a chief boatswain's mate, the highest noncommissioned rank in 
the service, equivalent to a master sergeant. He frequently served as a public 
spokesman, urging U.S. workers to increase production and support for the 
soldiers and sailors he helped to transport. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he resumed his light comedy roles with "Carnival in Costa 
Rica," "Captain From Castille," "That Lady in Ermine" and "Deep Waters." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1950s, he made such films as "Happy Go Lovely," "Lost Continent," 
"Prisoners of the Casbah," "The Americano" and the classic "Around the World in 
80 Days." 
</P>
<P>
 His film career continued well into the 1960s with such films as "Ocean's 
Eleven," "The Castilian," "Sergeant Deadhead" and "Marriage on the Rocks." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 1950s and 1960s, Romero also became a popular guest on various 
television series. Along with "Batman," he was the urbane, mysterious foreign 
courier in the series "Passport to Danger," and appeared frequently in variety 
series such as the Milton Berle, Martha Raye, Dinah Shore, Betty Hutton, Red 
Skelton and Jimmy Stewart shows. 
</P>
<P>
 He also played guest roles in drama series such as "The Zane Grey Theatre" and 
"Playhouse 90" and in Westerns such as "Wagon Train" and "Stage Coach West." 
Younger audiences also will remember him from "Ironside," "Fantasy Island" and 
"The Love Boat." 
</P>
<P>
 For a brief time in 1972, Romero ran a restaurant in Los Angeles called 
Cappucino. 
</P>
<P>
 He also became a popular actor and dancer on the dinner theater circuit in the 
1970s and '80s, appearing in such plays as "My Three Angels," "Goodbye, Tiger, 
Goodbye Fifi," "A Dash of Spirits" and "The Max Factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Pragmatically always finding the medium that could use him, Romero never tried 
to resurrect his original career as a nightclub dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't dance (professionally) anymore," he said in the 1960s. "I'm getting 
too old for that kind of stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of shape, oh, brother," he said after one dance act in Las Vegas. "I was 
wearing corn plasters above and below my toes and taping my ankles twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero was one of the first Hollywood actors to demand a percentage of profits 
in payment for his film roles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, in honor of his 50th year in films, he received the career 
achievement award at the Hollywood International Celebrity Awards Banquet. That 
same year he earned a Nosotros Golden Eagle award for his success as a Latino 
in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the octogenarian accepted the Imagen Hispanic Media award for 
lifetime achievement. In 1992, the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce gave him 
its Will Rogers Memorial award. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero lived and performed long enough to feel like something of an 
anachronism. In 1965, he told The Times' Champlin how Hollywood had changed in 
the 30 years he had gone from studio contract player to forced free-lancer: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new town. The old elegance is gone. It used to be one big family, this 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "You knew everybody at all the studios and you saw them often," he said. 
"Every Sunday night you'd be at the Trocadero for the show and you'd know 
everybody. No tourists, no gawkers. Now I don't know half of the young people 
in the industry. It's too spread out, too diffuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," he mused, "I wonder what I'm doing here." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero is survived by his brother, Eduardo, three nieces, one nephew and three 
great nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be private. The family has asked that any memorial 
donations be made to the Arthritis Foundation.

RABIN PUTS PRESSURE ON ARAFAT, REFUSES TO RESUME TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin tightened the screws on Yasser Arafat on Sunday, 
refusing to send Israeli delegates back to negotiations with the Palestinians 
until the PLO chairman accepts what had been agreed on in the last round of 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will let them sweat a bit -- Israel's not in a rush," Rabin told his 
Cabinet, putting off Israel's return to scheduled negotiations on Palestinian 
self-government to give his government and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization time to reflect on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin is angry over what he sees as an effort by Arafat not only to trap him 
into more concessions in the complex negotiations on Palestinian 
self-government, but to gain greater standing among Palestinians by humiliating 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the point of reaching agreements?" Rabin asked in a radio interview. 
"This is not the way to move ahead. We want to get answers. We clearly cannot 
rely on verbal agreements with the PLO; everything must be in writing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin is also playing to a domestic audience worried about the price of 
peace with the Palestinians, and his renewed toughness toward the PLO and his 
insistence on Israel's security needs are reassuring to many. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the basis for discussion is Yasser Arafat's new demands, then there is no 
basis right now for continuation of the talks," said Environment Minister Yossi 
Sarid of the dovish Meretz Party, reflecting popular support for Rabin's stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the accord Israel signed with the PLO in September, Israeli military 
forces should have begun withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank area 
of Jericho on Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline was missed because of disputes over border crossings into the 
territories, the size of the Jericho area and security for Jewish settlements 
in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 What might have begun as a tactical repositioning by Arafat in the 
negotiations appears to have grown into a serious crisis. Now, the Israelis 
most committed to reaching peace with the Palestinians -- Rabin, Sarid and 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres among them -- are expressing their doubts about 
the trustworthiness of Arafat and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave the Palestinians in this agreement a great historic opportunity. If 
they want to wait, let them wait," Peres commented bitterly. "It doesn't 
threaten us." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir Moussa said he is talking with both 
sides and hopes to reach an agreement on resuming direct negotiations between 
them in a day or so in the Red Sea resort town of Taba. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ready to renew the talks in Taba, but only on the basis of an 
understanding that the starting point is the Cairo document," Rabin said, 
referring to the framework that Israel insists was negotiated last week with 
Moussa's mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO says that document was never more than a proposal and an Israeli one 
at that. 
</P>
<P>
 In a reply broadcast on Israel Army Radio, PLO negotiator Nabil Shaath said, 
"I don't know which paper Prime Minister Rabin is talking about." Shaath said 
there were working papers, handwritten drafts of compromise proposals and 
minutes of the meetings in Cairo, but no agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said the two main points at issue were the size of the Jericho district 
under autonomy -- Israel has offered about 22 square miles -- and how residents 
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip would cross the borders from Jordan and Egypt 
into the autonomous zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel insists on maintaining control at the crossings to prevent an influx of 
weapons and the return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who had 
fled or were expelled in past Arab-Israeli wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin told the Cabinet on Sunday that Arafat wanted changes that would 
circumvent Israeli border controls and give the Palestinians symbols of 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things Arafat wants aren't doodads, but serious things that have not been 
brought up before," Rabin told the Cabinet, according to an Israeli official 
who briefed journalists on the session. "If they try to raise questions, 
through the hesitations of the PLO chairman, about what was in the agreement, 
then everything is open."

INDIA AND PAKISTAN MEET OVER KASHMIR DISPUTE; SOUTH ASIA: NATIONS RESUME 
CONTACTS FOR FIRST TIME IN 16 MONTHS. THERE IS LITTLE OPTIMISM THEY CAN RESOLVE 
THEIR DIFFERENCES OVER THE BORDER TERRITORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 India and Pakistan, suspicious neighbors who have fought three wars since 
independence, met Sunday for the first time in 16 months to see if they could 
narrow their acrimonious differences over the border territory of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 "One object of my visit is to check out whether it is the last chance," Indian 
Foreign Secretary J.N. Dixit, head of his country's five-member delegation, 
told reporters after arriving in Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indian press reported that Dixit is carrying a proposal to make the "line 
of control" separating Indian- and Pakistani-held parts of Kashmir into an 
international border, plus assurances that India will grant its share of the 
mountainous territory greater autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first round of talks, however, the Pakistanis' chief conclusion was 
that the Indians had nothing new to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reports trickling out of the Foreign Office say that, in sum, the Indians 
have belied the impression that they would come up with a new formula," Syed 
Talat Hussain, assistant editor of the News, an Islamabad daily, said by 
telephone. "Both sides reiterated known positions." 
</P>
<P>
 The first round of discussions, between Dixit and Pakistani Foreign Secretary 
Shahryar Khan, lasted about an hour and a half Sunday. Dixit then left by plane 
for Karachi to see Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. 
</P>
<P>
 During their meeting, Bhutto challenged India to "take visible steps" to end 
the widespread brutalities that international and local watchdog groups have 
accused Indian forces of committing in their battle against Kashmiri 
separatists. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixit, expressing hope that Indo-Pakistani ties would improve markedly as a 
result of the resumed contacts, gave Bhutto a letter from Indian Prime Minister 
P.V. Narasimha Rao, but the contents were not disclosed, reports from Karachi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Dixit is to meet with Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali, the Pakistani foreign 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pakistanis, who originally spoke hopefully about the negotiations, had 
become gloomier as the talks neared. Bhutto said she was "not very optimistic" 
about a breakthrough, and other officials charged India with stepping up 
repression in Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing to feel optimistic about -- killings are going on, villages 
are being torched, women are being raped (and) deaths taking place," Pakistan's 
Ali declared on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 After a gap in the dialogue at foreign secretary level since August, 1992, the 
Islamabad talks mark the first time that Kashmir, the chief bone of contention 
in Indo-Pakistani relations, has been a specific agenda topic. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure to negotiate from the United States, Britain and other countries has 
been considerable. The Western countries are worried about India's and 
Pakistan's suspected attempts to build or acquire nuclear weapons and 
ground-to-ground missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 An insurgency in the Indian-controlled state of Jammu and Kashmir is now 
entering its fourth year; India has waged a campaign of brutal repression in 
reply. The unofficial toll runs as high as 20,000 deaths, mostly of civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making people disappear . . . extrajudicial executions, death in custody, all 
this stuff, frankly there is no excuse for," Assistant Secretary of State Robin 
Raphael said last October. She also shocked Indians by saying the Clinton 
Administration considers Kashmir a "disputed territory" that may not 
necessarily be part of India forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Pakistanis believe that the Indians are only going through the motions of 
negotiating as a public relations exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Indians, they believe that the Pakistanis will insist on some major 
proposal, such as a referendum so that the 7.7 million inhabitants of Jammu and 
Kashmir can determine their own fate. But New Delhi's foreign policy 
Establishment has made it clear that the sovereignty of the Indian state is not 
negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
 The forgotten party to the negotiations seems to be the Kashmiris themselves, 
many of whom prefer independence. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of Dixit's arrival, Indian authorities said Kashmiri militants 
detonated 14 bombs in the state's Doda district to protest the Indo-Pakistani 
talks and sow panic. BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 The historical root of the Kashmir dispute dates to the agony-filled period of 
August-October, 1947, and the partition of British India. The fate of the 
princely states was to be determined according to their rulers' wish, the will 
of their populace and geography. Maharajah Hari Singh of Kashmir, a Hindu, had 
dreamed of independence for the "Switzerland of Asia," but as Pakistani troops 
poured into the northern and eastern parts of his domain, he signed the 
Instrument of Accession to India, despite the fact that a majority of his 
subjects were Muslim. India and Pakistan fought two of their three wars over 
control of Kashmir, and their soldiers still face off across the Siachen 
Glacier 20,000 feet above sea level in the Himalayas.

 FOLLOW THE MONEY: Clinton Administration lawyers are quietly at work on a 
Supreme Court brief that could save California a cool $4 billion. The high 
court has agreed to hear a challenge to the state's so-called unitary tax on 
multinational corporations. California taxes these companies based on the 
percentage of their worldwide operations that are conducted in the state. But 
British-owned Barclays Bank says it should instead be taxed in California 
according to its profit in the state -- a computation that would produce a 
smaller tax payment. . . . In the lower courts, the George Bush Administration 
sided with Barclays. After initially trying to avoid taking a stand, the 
Clinton White House has now decided to throw its weight behind the state. The 
change could prove crucial, since the views of the sitting Administration carry 
special weight in international tax cases. . . . If California lost, it could 
be forced to refund $4 billion to an array of international corporations. The 
brief goes to the court in mid-January. One warning: The fact the court has 
decided to hear the Barclays challenge suggests that at least four justices may 
want to overturn the lower courts and back the bank.

 A COUPLE OF CUTUPS: For more than 20 years, one of the least coveted duties of 
the secretary of state was the occasional obligatory meeting with Syrian 
President Hafez Assad. Arguably the smartest -- and probably the most ruthless 
-- leader in the Middle East, Assad is known for holding five- and six-hour 
meetings without a break, a form of psychological and physical gamesmanship. So 
it came as a great surprise when associates heard dour-faced Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher say he found Assad a guy with a great sense of humor. . . . 
Christopher, whose own comedic sense is so dry a lot of people miss it, 
actually enjoys the encounters. Good thing. Assad -- who less amused observers 
call "The Butcher of Hamma" -- likes to begin the meetings with a lengthy 
description of his version of the history of the area, starting with the 
Crusades.

 GOOD YEAR, BAD YEAR: President Clinton's Renaissance Weekend with 
deep-thinking friends at Hilton Head Island, S.C., consisted mostly of seeking 
enlightenment on the golf links, including one last round of golf on Sunday 
before heading back to Washington. But he also took the opportunity to stroke a 
press corps that has given him mixed notices. He went so far as to thank 
reporters on New Year's Eve for a "good year." . . . Once out of their earshot, 
however, Clinton chafed in an off-the-record chat about the treatment his team 
has gotten from critics. Sources say he picked up the phrase "culture of 
critique" from semanticist Deborah Tannen, another Renaissance Weekend 
attendee, and went on to describe his unhappiness with pundits who denounce 
events they don't fully understand. . . . In the private session, Clinton also 
made the case for his health care plan. It won an enthusiastic reception from 
the audience.

 ROYAL TREAT: Princess Diana's shopping spree in Washington last week sent the 
distinguished British press corps of Washington into rough waters. The 
Washington Brits, who normally disdain the tabloid foolishness of the Royal 
Family's marital escapades, dashed after the princess through shopping malls 
and hunted for interviews with store clerks who served her. One high-brow 
writer from the Manchester Guardian got wind that the princess might be dining 
at Sesto Senso, a hot new Italian bistro in the district, so he booked a table 
for eavesdropping. The princess canceled. The reporter did not. THOMAS B.

AMERICAN ALBUM: RESTORED HIROSHIMA B-29 IS HEADED FOR MUSEUM; THE ENOLA GAY, 
WHICH DROPPED THE A-BOMB, IS NEAR MINT CONDITION. SMITHSONIAN WILL EXHIBIT IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Aug. 5, 1945, after the atomic bomb destined for Hiroshima was loaded in 
the bomb bay of B-29 Superfortress No. 82, Col. Paul Tibbets sent for a sign 
painter. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, a young Army Air Corps enlisted man, pulled away from a 
softball game, carefully inscribed the name "Enola Gay" in foot-high letters 
beneath the pilot's window. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the 30-year-old colonel and the airplane he named for his mother 
became one of the significant and enduringly controversial figures in the 
history of warfare: They dropped the first atomic bomb. Five years after that 
blinding flash, the weapon was estimated to have caused 200,000 fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly a decade now, technicians have been at work restoring the bomber, 
perhaps the most famed artifact of World War II, to mint condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective," said Bernie Poppert, a onetime aircraft mechanic who has been 
one of the leaders of the effort, "is to preserve the history of the 
technology, so people can look at it 250 years from now and see exactly how it 
was done." 
</P>
<P>
 But for even longer than technicians have worked to preserve the plane, 
officials have debated what should be done with it. They have decided that 50 
years after the Enola Gay dropped the atomic bomb code-named "Little Boy" on 
Japan, the plane will be put on display in the National Air and Space Museum of 
the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration, one of the most extensive such projects ever undertaken, is 
nearly complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Mechanics have taken the huge engines apart, removed and restored the wings 
and landing gear and refurbished the cockpit, bomb bay and .50-caliber machine 
guns in the tail. 
</P>
<P>
 The compartment where Tibbets and his crew guided the mission to Hiroshima now 
looks as it did when the new plane was turned over to the 509th Composite Bomb 
Group in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 Stored in a dim, unheated hangar at the Smithsonian's Paul E. Garber facility 
-- where other historically important planes await restoration -- the fuselage 
attracts a steady stream of visitors who make their way out to this Washington 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 They have included Tibbets and Japanese survivors of the bombing nearly half a 
century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to put the bomber in the spotlight at the Air and Space Museum 
was not easily made. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane's 132-foot wingspan created a huge problem for a museum already 
packed with priceless civilian and military aircraft and space vehicles. But 
there was more to it than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at the subject for some years," said Michael J. Neufeld, a museum 
curator specializing in World War II-era aircraft. "People have very strong 
feelings about this plane because of the sensitivity about nuclear warfare. We 
have gotten surprising and contradictory responses about it. We get people 
saying that we're hiding the aircraft. We have people saying that it shouldn't 
be displayed at all because it would be a celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 Most visitors who come here stare silently through the glass of the 
bullet-shaped nose into the compartment where Tibbets and co-pilot Robert Lewis 
sat, and where bombardier Thomas Ferebee aimed the bomb for Aioi Bridge in 
downtown Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I saw it in 1987, it gave me a very creepy feeling," Neufeld 
said. "It really did." 
</P>
<P>
 Ownership of the plane was transferred to the Smithsonian in 1949, but it was 
parked at several Air Force bases until 1960, when technicians began taking it 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, including seven years when it sat unnoticed on a ramp at 
Andrews Air Force base near Washington, souvenir hunters made occasional forays 
against it and scratched their names into the fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious restoration work began in 1984, and three years later, a decision was 
made to put it on display. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in 1995, the forward section of the fuselage, including the bomb bay and 
cockpit, will be taken to the Air and Space Museum, remaining there for several 
months as part of a display commemorating the 50th anniversary of the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, plans are to reattach the wings and landing gear and put the entire 
plane on permanent display at an Air and Space Museum annex to be built 
adjacent to Dulles International Airport outside Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 There it will be joined by other historic planes -- numbering in the hundreds 
-- that cannot now be displayed in the current museum for lack of space.

 A Russian passenger jet crashed this morning shortly after takeoff from the 
Siberian city of Irkutsk, apparently killing all 116 people aboard, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

VIOLENCE, ULTIMATUMS IMPERIL PEACE IN ULSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A peace initiative for Northern Ireland received a severe setback Sunday after 
increased violence in the province was followed by unyielding statements by 
Irish republicans and British Prime Minister John Major. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, Major gave the Irish Republican Army a "take it or leave it" 
ultimatum, referring to the peace proposal that he and Irish Prime Minister 
Albert Reynolds signed Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Major warned the IRA and its political arm, Sinn Fein, that they will face 
international isolation if they reject the proposal to end 25 years of violence 
in Ulster, as Northern Ireland is also known. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not entering into negotiations," Major said Sunday, a day after an IRA 
bomb blitz of stores in the Belfast region caused millions of dollars in 
damage. "The joint declaration lies on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in a Dublin newspaper Sunday, top Sinn Fein official Martin 
McGuinness condemned the British-Irish peace plan because it fails to commit 
Britain to a troop withdrawal and gives the Protestant Unionists in Ulster 
final say on the province's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid the prospects of the declaration, as far as republicans are 
concerned, to say the least are worthless," McGuinness said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it will take as long as three weeks before Sinn Fein officially 
responds to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the peace proposal, the London and Dublin governments will not 
officially meet with Sinn Fein or the IRA until three months after their acts 
of violence in Ulster ceased. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuinness' remarks, together with the firebombings and the killing of a 
British soldier in the province over the weekend, marked a hardening of the 
republican position. 
</P>
<P>
 In Belfast, republican sources said that IRA guerrillas decided to step up 
attacks on military and civilian targets to build public support for the 
withdrawal of the 20,000 British troops in Ulster. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, McGuinness said: "Our position remains what it has been in 
the past: The British should be out of here in the lifetime of a Parliament -- 
within five years." 
</P>
<P>
 But Major reaffirmed his "rock-solid" support for the Protestant Unionists' 
right to decide whether to remain part of the United Kingdom or unite with the 
Irish Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 And David Trimble, a leading Ulster Unionist member of Parliament, said that 
McGuinness' remarks confirm that the IRA does not want peace. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the British government should not be "strung along" while the 
IRA takes its time deciding when to release a formal response to the 
British-Irish proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have got their answer," Trimble said.

IN AFGHAN CAPITAL, FACTIONS BATTLE FOR STRATEGIC SITES; WARFARE: MORE THAN 600 
ARE WOUNDED IN THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF THE NEW YEAR. DOZENS ARE REPORTED KILLED.

 Feuding Islamic factions blasted each other with air strikes, rockets and 
automatic gunfire Sunday in a major battle for the presidential palace and 
other strategic sites in the shattered capital. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600 people, both civilians and soldiers, have been treated at three 
Kabul hospitals since the latest blood bath began in the pre-dawn darkness on 
New Year's Day. In addition, dozens were killed, and many of the wounded have 
not been able to reach hospitals, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 President Burhanuddin Rabbani's militia, which controls the largest chunk of 
Kabul, was trying to withstand an onslaught by the combined forces of Prime 
Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Abdul Rashid Dostum, an ex-general in the 
former Communist army. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six separate Islamic factions hold parts of the capital. Most or all 
were involved in the shooting, but none is considered capable of delivering a 
decisive blow in the 14-year-old war. 
</P>
<P>
 The militias had formed a coalition government after ousting the Soviet-backed 
Communist regime in 1992. But since then, they turned their guns on each other 
in a personal feud among their leaders, leaving an estimated 10,000 dead in 
Kabul and flattening entire neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbani's militia appeared to be clinging to the city's most crucial sites, 
including the presidential palace in the heart of Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
 But the palace and the sprawling grounds were hit repeatedly with rockets and 
artillery fire in the heaviest fighting in six months. The extent of the damage 
was not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbani's supporters claimed that they killed 200 enemy soldiers, wounded 300 
and captured 820 while suffering only 18 deaths among their fighters. However, 
the figures could not be confirmed and the parties regularly exaggerate their 
battlefield successes. 
</P>
<P>
 The civilian casualty toll was heavy. Most of the fighting was waged with 
rockets and artillery shells that are notoriously inaccurate. Many missed 
military targets and slammed into private homes and shops that had been 
shuttered. 
</P>
<P>
 The normally bustling streets of Kabul were empty except for the occasional 
tank and heavily armed soldiers making quick dashes from one side of the street 
to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Plumes of smoke rose into the winter sky. The city rumbled throughout the day 
as the rockets came crashing down. 
</P>
<P>
 Electricity, sporadic even in periods of relative calm, was off. International 
phone lines have been down for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport was closed, and state-run Radio Afghanistan stopped broadcasting 
Saturday after the fighting began. 
</P>
<P>
 Two shells hit the main military hospital, a rocket hit the operating theater 
of the Jamhuriat hospital and several rockets landed in the grounds of a third 
hospital. There were no immediate details of casualties.

GUNMEN ATTACK U.N. AID AGENCY IN SOMALIA

 Unidentified gunmen broke into a World Food Program compound in the southern 
city of Baidoa, killing one Somali and wounding another, U.N. officials said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.N. military official said it was premature to blame the Saturday 
night attack on Muslim extremists, but that U.N. analysts suspect the shootings 
may be part of a larger campaign against non-Muslim aid agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The official, who spoke on condition his name not be published, would not 
specify what information the United Nations possesses about threats by Muslim 
extremists.

DOLE SAYS RENO 'DRAGGING FEET' ON INQUIRY; ETHICS: GOP SENATE LEADER URGES HER 
TO NAME AN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL TO PROBE CLINTON'S LINKS TO FAILED S&L. SHE HAS 
BACKED USING CAREER PROSECUTORS.

<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno should stop "dragging her feet" and appoint an 
independent counsel to investigate President Clinton's possible links to a 
failed savings and loan firm in Arkansas, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's high time she did what she knows she should do," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the President's sake and for the sake of the integrity of the attorney 
general's office she should move," the Kansas Republican said on NBC-TV's "Meet 
the Press." He said Reno had "wasted a lot of time dragging her feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno has said that career prosecutors, and not a specially appointed counsel, 
should handle the case of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Assn., the failed 
thrift owned by Clinton friend James McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators are looking into the costly collapse of the S&L and 
whether any funds from the thrift were illegally diverted to Whitewater 
Development Corp., a real estate venture owned jointly by the Clinton family 
and McDougal when Clinton was governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Also being examined is whether any Madison Guaranty money was inappropriately 
routed to Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Muddying the waters, the file on the Clinton's Whitewater investment was 
removed from the office of White House lawyer Vincent Foster just after Foster 
killed himself last July. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents were believed to be missing until the White House disclosed that 
they were in the hands of Clinton's personal attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The President has since ordered the file turned over to federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole and other Republicans have criticized the Democratic-controlled banking 
and finance committees in Congress for playing politics in refusing to launch 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 But senior White House adviser George Stephanopoulos, appearing on ABC-TV's 
"This Week With David Brinkley," spoke Sunday of a "remarkable conversion" of 
Republicans now seeking to resurrect the lapsed special counsel law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that they sense that there might be some perceived political advantage to 
going after this, they're all for it all of a sudden," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP lawmakers, embittered by the drawn-out independent counsel investigation 
of the Iran-Contra affair during the Ronald Reagan Administration, have fought 
renewal of legislation reauthorizing the appointment of counsels. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanopoulos said the Whitewater issue was examined during the 1992 
presidential campaign and Clinton has now turned over to the Justice Department 
all documents related to the real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
 "No laws were broken. The Justice Department will show that, but there is no 
need at this time for an independent counsel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, also speaking on ABC, said there 
was "no question" that an independent counsel was warranted, and "the longer 
the Clintons avoid doing that, the more, frankly, people are going to suspect 
there is a reason they don't want an independent counsel."

SHIFT IN HISTORY: NATIONAL ARCHIVES MOVES; RECORDS: ARCHIVISTS ARE BOXING UP 
NIXON'S TAPES, KENNEDY'S WINDSHIELD AND BRADY'S PHOTOS. IT WILL TAKE YEARS TO 
TRUCK 1,300 LOADS TO A NEW SITE IN MARYLAND.

 Hate moving? Be thankful you're not the National Archives. 
</P>
<P>
 It is carting thousands of boxes and crates of precious historical items -- 
from rare Civil War photographs to Watergate tapes -- to a $250-million 
research building in College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 The move beginning today will take three years, require at least 1,300 
truckloads and cost $6.8 million, said Susan Cooper, spokeswoman for the 
National Archives and Records Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the 765,934 cubic feet of material will be placed in 2.3 million 
small, specially designed and cushioned containers so that the contents are 
protected from temperature fluctuations and humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 The items range from documents so old and fragile they can't be exposed to 
sunlight to the cracked windshield of the limousine President John F. Kennedy 
sat in when he was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
 The windshield will be wrapped in Styrofoam, put in a specially designed crate 
and transported along a special route to avoid potholes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Watergate tapes will be transported in armored cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many people facing a move, the National Archives didn't wait until the 
last minute to pack. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people who have already been working on this move for five years, 
full time," Cooper said. "And they will continue to work on this for another 
three years." 
</P>
<P>
 The movers will transport 7 million photographs, 11 million charts, maps and 
aerial photographs, 112,274 reels of motion pictures and 200,122 sound and 
video recordings, according to archivists. 
</P>
<P>
 The photograph collection includes pictures taken by Mathew Brady during the 
Civil War, work by Ansel Adams and hundreds of thousands of photographs taken 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items that will be on display at the new research facility will be 
many of former President Richard Nixon's records, documents on the Kennedy 
assassination and audiotapes from the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The building in College Park -- known as Archives II -- features the most 
advanced pollution and environmental controls and preservation technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine laboratories will allow archivists to use the latest document 
preservation and storage methods and even develop new ones, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paper records will be stored on mobile shelves that can be shifted 
electronically at a push of a button to provide access. Laid end to end, the 
520 miles of shelves would reach from the agency's downtown office to Ann 
Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The building can hold up to 2 million cubic feet of records, enough space to 
accommodate the acquisition of materials into the next century, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, more than a quarter-million cubic feet of material and documents 
-- including the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of 
Rights -- remain at the Archives' main building in Washington.

IF ONE CRAVES LITIGATION, D.C. IS PLACE TO BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you live in Utah or Indiana, relax. But watch your back in Washington, 
D.C., the worst place in the nation in terms of getting sued, according to a 
survey by Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Mexico and Nevada are not exactly havens from 
lawsuits either, ranking second through fifth on the magazine's list of 
litigious places, made available Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes reports that the greatest concentration of litigiousness -- lawsuits 
stemming from car accidents to medical malpractice -- is in the Northeast, 
while the Midwest and Rocky Mountain states have lower levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's ranking says the nation's capital is by far the worst place in 
terms of getting sued. Lawyers become involved in 61% of auto accidents in the 
capital, the average malpractice premium for an orthopedic surgeon is more than 
$25,000, and the city paid nearly $14 million to settle liability claims in the 
last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Detroit juries are six times more generous in their cash awards to 
plaintiffs who sue the city than juries in Phoenix, the median. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly two-thirds of car accidents end up involving lawyers in Maryland, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes devised the ranking by averaging such factors as the percentage of 
automobile accidents in which lawyers get involved, the average cost for one 
year's malpractice insurance for an orthopedic surgeon and the number of 
members of a state's trial lawyers association per 100,000 population.

NURSE'S AIDE WHO SAID SHE WAS ORDERED TO SWITCH BABIES DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nurse's aide who said a doctor ordered her to switch the name tags on two 
newborn babies has died of emphysema complications. 
</P>
<P>
 The babies left Hardee Memorial Hospital in 1978 with the wrong parents, 
triggering a four-year custody fight when one child died and the couple who 
raised her went looking for the other girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The other child was raised in Sarasota, Fla., as Kimberly Mays. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurse's aide, Patsy Webb, told CBS on Nov. 23 that she refused the order 
from Dr. Ernest Palmer to switch the babies' bracelets but noticed the next day 
they had been switched. Webb died Thursday at age 59. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said she remained silent for years because she did not want to lose 
health insurance coverage for her ailing child. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she finally spoke out in November because she knew she was dying. 
</P>
<P>
 The switch was discovered in 1988, and Webb said in a sworn statement the 
following year that she knew nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly, now 15, won the legal right last year to avoid any contact with 
Ernest and Regina Twigg, the biological parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Both families won multimillion-dollar awards from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer denied any role in the switch, and other hospital employees rallied 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hardee County Sheriff's Department decided not to open a criminal 
investigation, saying the statute of limitations had run out.

FEDERAL COST OF RUNNING WELFARE SOARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cost of running welfare programs is rising more than twice as fast as the 
number of people on the rolls, according to federal investigators who blame an 
overly complex and bloated bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 A draft report by the inspector general at the Department of Health and Human 
Services says the federal government spends $6 billion to $8 billion a year 
helping states deliver food stamps, Medicaid and monthly cash benefits under 
the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. 
</P>
<P>
 The HHS investigators said federal administrative costs increased by 43% 
between 1987 and 1991, from about $3.4 billion to $4.9 billion, while the 
number of recipients in the three programs increased on average by 18%, from 
53.3 million to 62.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The data do not support the contention that rising administrative costs are 
the result of expanded program responsibilities," the investigators say in 
their report, obtained by the Associated Press under the Freedom of Information 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also found that the federal government's share of benefit payments 
under AFDC, Medicaid and food stamps is growing quickly: from $45 billion in 
1987 to $79 billion in 1991, an increase of 74%. 
</P>
<P>
 The states and federal government generally split the administrative costs of 
welfare programs in half. The investigators say, however, the federal 
government cannot determine what it is paying for at the state and local level 
without a considerable investment in auditing and monitoring, and those costs 
would be prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report, the inspector general's office says the system the 
states use to charge the federal government for those administrative costs has 
"degenerated into a highly technical accounting and allocation maze." 
</P>
<P>
 That report also suggests that consultants are taking advantage of outdated 
federal policies to reap bigger payments for the states. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators say the system must be changed or administrative costs will 
continue their "accelerated growth and remain burdensome and costly to audit."

FIRE AT 1920S-ERA HOME FEATURED IN MAGAZINE CAUSES $175,000 DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 1920s-era Moroccan-style home featured in Sunday's Los Angeles Times 
Magazine was damaged in a fire that destroyed two rooms and vintage 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters arrived at the Silver Lake house about 6:30 p.m. and doused the 
blaze in about 30 minutes, said Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey.There 
were no injuries, and no one was in the house at the time. The cause is under 
investigation, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze was confined to two rooms on the second floor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-story house features a mosque-style dome and minarets. Inside, it has 
tiled walls and beamed ceilings. After the owner bought the home in 1989, he 
furnished it with vintage California pottery, Moroccan tables and old Persian 
and Turkish rugs, which were featured in a photo essay for the magazine's Style 
section. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neighbors approached firefighters with copies of the Los Angeles Times," 
Humphrey said. "The firefighters said, 'Sure enough, this is the place."' 
</P>
<P>
 The house sustained about $100,000 in damage, and $75,000 to its contents, 
Humphrey said.

 A motorist apparently impatient with a slower-moving car on Interstate 15 
fired a bullet into the vehicle, killing a young volunteer firefighter, 
authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmett Royston, 19, was riding in a Dodge Colt driven by his brother, Ian, 22, 
when he was shot to death about 1:45 p.m. Friday, said Deputy Mark Lohman of 
the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of a 1980s Cadillac rapidly approached the Royston car as it 
traveled in the fast lane of Interstate 15 in the Glen Avon area, about 50 
miles east of Los Angeles, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver of the Cadillac became impatient and pulled to the right of the 
Dodge into the No. 2 lane. The driver pointed an unknown type handgun at Emmett 
and fired one shot, striking him in the face," Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cadillac continued north on the freeway at more than 90 m.p.h. No arrest 
has been made, the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, Ian Royston drove his brother to the California Department 
of Forestry station in Glen Avon, where Emmett was a volunteer fireman. The 
wounded brother was taken to Riverside Community Hospital, where he was 
pronounced dead.

CUSTOMS INSPECTORS DRAINING SUSPICIOUS PROPANE RAIL CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After stopping a freight train suspected of involvement in smuggling across 
the U.S.-Mexico border, authorities were draining two propane tanker cars in a 
San Bernardino County rail yard Sunday in order to conduct a search. 
</P>
<P>
 The top suspicion is that the train carried drugs clandestinely across the 
border from Mexico, said U.S. Customs spokeswoman Bobbie Cassidy. But the 
laborious process of emptying propane gas fumes out of the tanker cars was 
expected to postpone the search until today or Tuesday, officials said, 
declining to give further details. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what we have yet," said Cassidy, who was unaware of any 
previous smuggling busts involving trains in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the contents of the tanker cars, there were numerous unanswered 
questions about the incident Sunday. The train crossed the border Thursday 
afternoon at Calexico, where customs inspectors determined that the supposedly 
empty cars were overweight, according to a law enforcement official who asked 
not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspectors put a hold on the cars, requiring them to clear further 
inspection before leaving the border area, but somehow a train ended up taking 
the cars north, according to the official. Investigators then scrambled to 
track down the train and bring the suspect cars to a Southern Pacific rail yard 
near Colton, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time they located them, they were in the (Colton) area," the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One informed source said the border inspectors determined an excess weight of 
about 6,000 pounds and that the train cars were suspicious because they lacked 
the usual identifying markers. 
</P>
<P>
 Customs officials declined further comment. A Southern Pacific Railroad 
official said the tank cars had been moved to a private repair facility nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday morning, firefighters were called to stand by during the process of 
"bleeding" volatile gas fumes from the tankers, according to a dispatcher for 
the Central Valley Fire District. He said firefighters left the scene Friday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, a propane tanker truck was involved in the biggest drug seizure in 
border history: Inspectors discovered about 7,700 pounds of cocaine hidden in 
the truck at the Otay Mesa commercial crossing. There have been periodic 
reports that trains are used in narcotics smuggling, according to law 
enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past several years, border law enforcement experts have expressed 
fear that powerful Latin American drug cartels will take advantage of the 
speeded flow of legitimate goods created by NAFTA to sneak narcotics shipments 
past overworked inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The cartels have expanded their use of trucking firms, food exporting 
companies and other businesses as fronts, according to experts.

UNEARTHING A HIDDEN PAST; ARCHEOLOGY: AFTER YEARS OF CONTROVERSY, NATIVE 
AMERICAN ARTIFACTS EXCAVATED FROM THE LOST VILLAGE OF ENCINO WILL BE ON 
DISPLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of the past decade, thousands of Native American artifacts recovered 
from the Lost Village of Encino, one of the costliest archeological excavations 
in state history, have been sitting in an Orange County warehouse, freed from 
the earth after centuries, but collecting dust in obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, however, the public will get its first chance to see the most 
significant pieces -- stone tools, shell beadwork and arrowheads -- when they 
are donated by an archeologist to two San Fernando Valley museums. Nancy 
Whitney-Desautels is celebrating the resolution of a series of controversies 
that have embroiled Native Americans, archeologists and the corporate 
developers of the site since the 3,000-year-old village was accidentally 
unearthed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The debates that have swirled around the finds have overshadowed their 
archeological importance, some scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was clearly a very important discovery for both the diversity and 
quantity of artifacts and also that so much of it was found intact," said Mark 
Raab, director of the Center for Public Archeology at Cal State Northridge. 
"But there hasn't been an extensive publication on it" in peer-reviewed 
archeological journals, he said, the key step in establishing scientific worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither the scientific community nor the public really know what's there, so 
displaying some of them should help." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney-Desautels said she hopes to deliver the first of the artifacts this 
month but arrangements with the museums have not been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift of about 10 pieces to the San Fernando Mission and San Gabriel 
Mission museums and the placement of other, larger artifacts -- probably at a 
state museum on Ventura Boulevard near the site of the find -- comes after 
Whitney-Desautels had refused for years to hand over the pieces until she was 
paid for her work by the company that constructed an office building on the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the settlement of a $1-million lawsuit against the developers in 1989 
and the completion of the cataloguing of most of the pieces, Whitney-Desautels 
said this month that she is ready to part with the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never intended to keep the artifacts, but a lot happened along the way," 
she said. "It's not really anybody's fault. The village was a surprise and 
there wasn't a lot of time to prepare for everything that was coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the recent history of the prehistoric village is a thoroughly modern 
story of cultural clashes, cost overruns, bankruptcy and even slow-growth 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, discovery of the village was simply the solution to a decades-old 
archeological mystery. For years, archeologists had attempted to find the ruins 
of the large settlement described in a 1769 diary kept by a member of the 
Spaniard Gaspar de Portola's expedition, the first Europeans known to have 
reached the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear that the village must have been somewhere in the vicinity of Los 
Encinos State Historical Park on Ventura Boulevard, where a spring that 
continues to flow today would have provided water. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the efforts of several researchers, no sign of the settlement was 
found, earning it the nickname the Lost Village of Encino. Many archeologists 
who had searched for it unsuccessfully, hampered by inexact Spanish maps, 
feared that recent urbanization might have irretrievably buried the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But in July, 1984, a construction crew accidentally solved the mystery. While 
demolishing a defunct restaurant on the southeast corner of Balboa and Ventura 
boulevards in preparation for construction of an office complex, the workers 
came across a few artifacts, leading eventually to the discovery of increasing 
numbers of them and then the skeletons of about 20 Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more than 2 million tiny artifacts and fragments of human and animal 
bone were found in the village, only a few thousand of the larger items are of 
real significance, Whitney-Desautels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those are mortars and pestles, milling stones, stone bowls and 
arrowheads and other projectile points. The presence of both Native American 
shell beads and Spanish glass beads suggests that the two groups engaged in 
trading before the village was abandoned for unknown reasons some time in the 
19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 During the dig, scientists also found the areas where villagers cooked, 
processed hides and made beads. 
</P>
<P>
 The village had a large burial site, where researchers dug up the bones or 
cremated remains of about 20 humans, 20 dogs and at least one bird. 
Whitney-Desautels believes the animals were used in sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
 Complying with state law that requires that such finds be examined and 
safeguarded by an archeologist, First Financial Group Inc., which was building 
the office complex, hired Whitney-Desautels. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Whitney-Desautels and First Financial negotiated a fee of $10,000 
to $20,000, but because the scope of the archeological work expanded as more 
and more artifacts and skeletons were unearthed, her excavations lasted almost 
eight months and the price eventually ballooned to $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 First Financial balked, firing Whitney-Desautels after paying her about 
$600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although First Financial did not return phone calls for this article, the 
company's vice president, Joel Shine, said at the time that the firm had gone 
beyond its legal requirements and refused to pay additional costs for the dig. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that real estate developers pay archeological excavation 
costs of up to .5% of the site's construction budget, which First Financial 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whitney-Desautels contended that the developer had also agreed to pay 
additional expenses for the excavation and preservation of the artifacts and 
said that she had paid $350,000 of her own money to complete the work. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1987, she filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. However, 
saying she had a "moral duty" to complete the work, she continued to sort, 
catalogue and preserve the pieces in the Newport Beach warehouse owned by her 
company, Scientific Resource Surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, she filed a lawsuit against First Financial which sought more 
than $1 million in compensation for labor, storage, attorney's fees and profits 
she maintained she would have earned if the developers had not breached their 
agreement with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, she placed a lien on the artifacts so First Financial could not 
get them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, representatives of Native American groups were also squabbling. 
Gabrielenos, Chumash and Fernandenos all claimed the village as the ancient 
dwelling place of their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandeno leaders maintained that the settlement is in an area they had 
inhabited for centuries. Chumash representatives cited reports by two 
consulting archeologists that found evidence of Chumash-style burials in the 
village. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whitney-Desautels said the artifacts she found were clearly the work of 
the Gabrielenos. The state Native American Heritage Commission also declared 
that the village had probably been inhabited by Gabrielenos. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, Native American remains belong to the groups representing 
descendants of the dead, as nearly as those can be determined. So, with the 
state commission backing them, the Gabrielenos won the right to reinter the 
bones, choosing the Los Encinos park, only half a block from the excavation 
site. On April 15, 1985, the park was closed to everyone else at dawn so a 
delegation of Gabrielenos could rebury the bones in a secret grave, its 
location known only to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounds of that rift have not healed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My great-great-grandmother owned that land, so I ask how it can be 
Gabrieleno?" said Rudy Ortega, 67, of San Fernando, who claims to be hereditary 
chief of the Fernandenos. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy reached Sacramento in 1985, when then-state Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Van Nuys), introduced legislation to set aside $11 million to buy land and 
build a museum to house the artifacts. A portion of that appropriation would 
have also helped First Financial pay Whitney-Desautels' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 But after state-hired archeologists concluded that the collection was 
insufficiently valuable to warrant its own museum, the bill stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins had to settle for a $195,000 appropriation to remodel the historic 
Garnier House in the Los Encinos park to house some of the artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Whitney-Desautels now says the museum at Los Encinos State Park will 
probably get only a selection of the artifacts, park manager Russell Kimura 
said he originally expected to receive as many pieces as Garnier House could 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought that we would get most of the larger pieces here," Kimura said. "I 
thought it had been arranged, but hopefully we can work something else out 
because this is something we'd like to be a part of." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, when a $35-million office building was planned for land across the 
street from the Lost Village site, an unusual alliance of Native Americans and 
slow-growth suburbanites opposed it, arguing that the area could contain 
additional artifacts and human remains. 
</P>
<P>
 After the developers, Katell Capretta Partners of Gardena, paid for an 
archeological survey -- which found no significant artifacts -- the city gave 
them the go-ahead to build. 
</P>
<P>
 With that battle ended, and large building complexes now covering both the 
excavation on the southeastern corner of Balboa and Ventura Boulevards and the 
northeast corner as well, attention turned back to Whitney-Desautels. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she had settled her lawsuit with First Financial in 1989 -- dividing 
ownership of the artifacts between them -- the pieces remained in her company's 
warehouse, where they were still being catalogued. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until this year that the work was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is still unclear where the majority of the artifacts will be placed, 
many who have been involved in the protracted battle believe the displays at 
the two museums will focus attention on the people who inhabited the area long 
ago -- and still do. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think that there aren't Indians in the San Fernando Valley 
anymore," said Ortega, the Fernandeno leader. "But I have 12 children, 69 
grandchildren and either 44 or 49 great-grandchildren, and they all live in the 
San Fernando Valley. Maybe by displaying these artifacts, we will remind people 
that we have been here a long time and plan to stay here."

CITY TO REVIEW POLICY AGAINST COYOTE TRAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan Klenner awoke Sunday to find a "snowstorm" of white feathers and the 
savaged carcasses of her last eight pet chickens strewn around the back yard of 
her family's Woodland Hills home -- the gruesome result, she said, of a 
nocturnal visit by prowling coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 The family called the Los Angeles Department of Animal Regulation for help. 
But the answer was the same as it was when two of the family's birds 
disappeared in separate incidents around Christmas: The city of Los Angeles is 
no longer in the coyote-trapping business. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, largely as a result of complaints by San Fernando Valley residents like 
Klenner, the city Board of Animal Regulation will begin reconsidering the 
6-month-old policy against trapping. The hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. at 
419 S. Spring St. in downtown Los Angeles. And on Jan. 24, the board will have 
a public hearing in the Valley on the controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the 54-year-old Klenner, who spent Sunday morning picking up what 
remained of the decorative animals she considered pets, the city's discussion 
is coming more than a little late. "I went out there and it was carnage," 
Klenner said. Had the city been able to place traps after the previous attacks, 
"this probably would not have happened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Animal Regulation had routinely responded to residents' coyote 
complaints, with officers providing and even setting the traps. But that ended 
in late June, when former Mayor Tom Bradley's departing animal board members, 
at the urging of animal rights activists, halted the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, animal control officers simply offer advice on how to prevent attacks and 
tell residents to contact government agencies that still trap coyotes in 
certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The current panel, with most of its members appointed by Mayor Richard 
Riordan, is free to set its own policy. But department officials and animal 
board member Lynne Exe, who has publicly favored a resumption of city trapping, 
doubt the current five-member board will change the policy, complaints from 
Valley residents notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it continues like this, there's going to be some severe damage to 
somebody," said city Animal Regulation Lt. Richard Felosky, who is in charge of 
the city's West Valley Animal Care and Control Center in Chatsworth. After 
hearing about Klenner's report Sunday, a frustrated Felosky said he favors 
trapping but is bound by city policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife activists have argued that the city should not be in the business of 
managing wild animals. They say the traps used to catch the coyotes -- although 
supposedly more humane than those used in the past -- can cause severe pain to 
the animals. In addition, one animal board member has estimated that it would 
cost the city about $100,000 a year to resume trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Klenner said she and others in her Woodland Hills neighborhood who 
have also lost animals to suspected coyote attacks want the city to reinstate 
trapping. In the 23 years that she, her husband and son have lived in their 
flatlands house, they always have kept animals but never had a coyote problem 
until this year, Klenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not legitimate to say we've moved into coyote habitat," she said. Animal 
control officials said the halt to city trapping, the abundance of food and 
small animals found in residential areas and the recent brush fires that 
consumed wildlands have combined to drive coyotes into Valley neighborhoods and 
spurred complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents Woodland Hills and last 
week pressed the department for the Valley public hearing, said she has been 
getting complaints from constituents. Chick expressed concern about the city's 
cost to resume trapping and added, "I'm not convinced yet that trapping is 
going to control the problem effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of stuff clouding this issue, emotions and fear," Chick said. 
And the councilwoman believes "one of the most effective ways" to avoid coyote 
attacks is for residents to take preventive measures, such as not leaving food 
out and keeping small domestic animals in fenced areas at night. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to her eight white silky chickens, small birds that have silky, 
hair-like feathers, Klenner said the coyotes had to scramble over two fences, 
including a five-foot chain-link that surrounded the corral where the birds 
roosted. From Saturday evening to Sunday morning, the family was home but heard 
no disturbance outside. 
</P>
<P>
 When she went outside Sunday morning, Klenner said, "from a distance, I saw a 
patch of what sort of resembled snow on the ground. And I knew instantly I had 
a lot of dead chickens." 
</P>
<P>
 Although other predators are known to kill chickens, Klenner said she is 
convinced that her birds' attackers were coyotes, even though she found no firm 
proof. 
</P>
<P>
 Klenner's son videotaped the scene Sunday morning and she took pictures to 
show to city officials. Klenner said that if she replaces the birds, she has no 
intention of keeping them in cages at night to ensure their safety. "That's not 
the way I choose to keep birds," she said.

STREET SMART: BABIES QUALIFY AS CAR-POOL PASSENGERS, BUT PETS DON'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Help! Please answer the question I ask myself every day as I enter the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Car-pool lanes are reserved for vehicles carrying two or more people, right? 
Is it legal to be in the car-pool lane when it is just my 14-month-old daughter 
and myself? 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, she is a person. However, does the law for car-pool lanes say you 
must have two or more adults in the car or just two or more people? 
</P>
<P>
 Renae Fernandez, Glendale 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Relax. You and your year-old daughter are not breaking the car-pool law. The 
rule is two or more people, with no age restrictions. "It can be a 1-day-old 
baby and herself," says California Highway Patrol Sgt. Ernie Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind, however, that you can't avoid a car-pool lane ticket if your 
only passenger has fur or feathers growing from it. "It cannot be a household 
pet," Garcia says. "Technically, pets are considered property, but infants are 
considered a person." 
</P>
<P>
 (We'll sleep better knowing that technically, babies are people, too.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even though you are driving lawfully, CHP officers say they hear some 
interesting excuses from solo drivers who are caught using car-pool lanes. One 
is the popular "Pets are people, too" argument, mentioned above. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, a pregnant woman driving alone argues that because she has a 
passenger inside her, she is a legal car-pooler. A sympathetic judge may 
dismiss the ticket after hearing this, but CHP officers say such decisions do 
not apply statewide. CHP officers can legally ticket a pregnant woman who 
drives alone in a car-pool lane, Garcia says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are those funeral home employees who argue that the body in the 
back of their hearse is the car-pool passenger. It won't wash, Garcia says. In 
the eyes of the law, only live commuting partners count. 
</P>
<P>
 One final note: Car-pool lanes throughout Southern California require two or 
more people per vehicle -- with one exception. That's the El Monte Transitway, 
a section of the San Bernardino Freeway that requires three or more people per 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 And what happens if you get stopped on this transitway while carrying one 
child and one potbellied pig? We'd rather not know. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm writing about a traffic problem that occurs outside the Van Nuys post 
office at Sherman Way and Haskell Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers who leave the post office lot on Haskell, intending to go east on 
Sherman Way, sometimes find it difficult to get into the left-turn lane at the 
corner. That's because this lane often fills up with cars that have just come 
off the San Diego Freeway exit, about a block north of the post office. 
</P>
<P>
 It would help if there were two left-turn lanes, rather than the single 
left-turn lane that is there now. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney Cohen, Encino 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You're in luck. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation has put together 
a plan to improve left turns at this intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who's mailed a package at this very busy post office knows that getting 
out of the parking lot can be a challenge. As you pointed out, the freeway 
sends lots of cars into the intersection, and the parking lot exit, so close to 
the corner, leaves very little room to maneuver across the lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the congestion, the city will revamp the southbound lane immediately 
next to the existing left-turn lane, says Tom Jones, a senior city 
transportation engineer. This second lane will be "left-turn optional," meaning 
you can turn left or go straight ahead. Northbound drivers will get a red light 
at this time to avoid collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has limited funds for such improvements, Jones says the work 
will be done in six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 And keep this in mind: The Van Nuys post office processes mail for the entire 
San Fernando Valley, and its back rooms operate around the clock. Beginning in 
April, this work will move to a new processing center near Santa Clarita, says 
David Mazer, a U.S. Postal Service spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys center will still sell stamps and provide other public services. 
But those big trucks that carry mail in and out, along with hundreds of 
processing workers, will no longer add to the traffic jams here. 
</P>
<P>

 Dear Street Smart:

 Until a few months ago, the traffic signals at two minor intersections along 
Magnolia Boulevard, just north of Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, only turned red 
when they were tripped by cars waiting to get through the intersection. I'm 
referring to the lights at Ranchito and Sunnyslope avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, these lights are set to turn red regularly, even if no car or pedestrian 
is waiting to cross. This impedes traffic. How can this situation be reversed? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The situation will be reversed, but you'll have to be patient. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit at both intersections is the detector, a device buried in the 
street. When a car arrives at the corner, the detector senses it and orders up 
a green light. When no cars are waiting, the signal on the cross street remains 
green for a longer period. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, a street maintenance crew accidentally damaged a detector on 
Ranchito, says Brian Gallagher, a city transportation engineer. City workers 
then set the signal to offer a green light at regular intervals so drivers on 
Ranchito would not be trapped behind an endless red light. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, city crews discovered that a detector was also broken on 
Sunnyslope. They set up a regular green-light sequence there, too. 
</P>
<P>
 These signals will again operate on a traffic-demand basis as soon as the 
detectors are fixed. Unfortunately, well over 100 detectors need repair 
throughout the city, and there's not enough money to immediately fix them and 
the city's other broken traffic devices. 
</P>
<P>
 The city sets priorities, and "fixing malfunctioning traffic signals is a 
higher priority than fixing broken detectors," Gallagher says. The Ranchito 
detector should be repaired within a month or two, the Sunnyslope detector in 
about six months, he predicts.

FIREFIGHTER INJURED IN CHRISTMAS TREE BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles firefighter was injured Sunday as he tried to extinguish a 
Christmas tree fire that caused $80,000 in damage to a Studio City home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old firefighter, a 12-year veteran of the Los Angeles Fire 
Department, injured his back while fighting the blaze at 11520 Decente Drive. 
He was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia, where he was 
listed in stable condition, Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was in the 2,500-square-foot house when the fire started at 11:22 a.m. 
It took 16 firefighters less than 20 minutes to extinguish the blaze, which 
caused $50,000 in damage to the structure and $30,000 damage to its contents.

ELECTRICAL PANEL BLAMED IN RESEDA FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire that damaged a Reseda cycle shop Saturday night, causing $220,000 in 
damages, was caused by an electrical problem inside the shop, according to the 
Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-five firefighters battled the blaze at Vick's Custom Cycle Shop at 17644 
Sherman Way for 40 minutes to prevent it from spreading to an adjoining shop, 
My Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was confined to the attic and mezzanine area of the cycle shop, Fire 
Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators determined that the blaze started in an electrical panel. 
There was $120,000 in damage to the structure and $100,000 in damage to the 
contents of the building.

JUBILEE CALLED THE TRUE 'INDEPENDENCE DAY' FOR BLACKS; CELEBRATIONS: EVENT 
MARKS THE SIGNING THAT ENDED SLAVERY. NAACP LEADER SAYS THE DOCUMENT OF 1776 
'DIDN'T HAVE OUR NAME ON IT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For African Americans who observe it, Jubilee Day is Independence Day, 
commemorating Jan. 1, 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln signed the 
Emancipation Proclamation, the document that freed the slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., executive director of the NAACP, which created the 
holiday about 15 years ago, hammered home that point Sunday as he spoke to a 
group of about 75 people who attended the 15th annual Jubilee Day celebration 
at the Greater Community Missionary Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our Declaration of Independence," said Chavis. "The one done up in 1776 
didn't have our name on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For community activist Ted Minor, such celebrations are instrumental in 
instilling pride among a people whose contributions have been largely ignored 
in the nation's history books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps to give us and our children a sense of personal dignity, and it 
helps further our culture and heritage," said Minor, who donned a green dashiki 
for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis' comments came after an arm-waving revival-like service at the small, 
stucco church tucked into the 11000 block of Norris Avenue in the heart of an 
African-American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis, who took over the leadership from Dr. Benjamin Hooks last April, 
challenged religious leaders and their congregations to carry the concepts of 
unity and brotherhood outside the church and into the streets as a method for 
curing social ills and furthering economic empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to leave a legacy for our young people to take hold," he told the 
crowd. "We have to lift them up because if we don't, who will?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take for granted your progress, you will lose it," he warned. "If you 
take for granted your life, you'll lose it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis also prodded the congregation to take greater responsibility for its 
neighborhoods and its children. He said they used to be a community 
responsibility but are now often left on their own in neighborhoods rocked by 
violence and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times things don't happen in our community because we're waiting for 
someone else," he said. "We have to take the initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 He endorsed projects that encourage people to turn in guns and urged citizens 
to come to the aid of the vast majority of young African Americans who are not 
connected with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by church leaders and local NAACP leaders, Chavis said he wants to use 
the network of more than 2,300 branch offices around the nation to broadcast a 
message about economic empowerment and cultural values to African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are groups who've come here since the Emancipation Proclamation and 
they're participating in our economy," said Chavis. 
</P>
<P>
 Under such a system, establishment of African American financial institutions 
would provide a solid base for business ventures and mainstream economic 
participation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step of the organization's economic push for blacks was seen in the 
"fair share" agreements of the early 1980s, contracts between the civil rights 
group and U.S. corporations to increase employment opportunities for African 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1950s, it was enough just to get a job -- we didn't care where," said 
William Gibson, chairman of the NAACP board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "But like anything else, our organization has evolved and matured, and today 
when I talk to a CEO about jobs, I'm not just talking about clerical work 
anymore," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis and other top NAACP officials are in Los Angeles for the taping of the 
27th annual Image Awards, which are held to recognize achievements by African 
Americans in the entertainment industry. Chavis and other officials had spent 
Sunday morning at the historic Second Baptist Church in South-Central Los 
Angeles.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: NAVY PILOT TEACHES DAREDEVILS TO GLIDE THROUGH THEIR 
AEROBATICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Watkins loves to see the test pilots from Edward Air Force Base arrive 
at his glider field in Llano. 
</P>
<P>
 They have a little swagger that seems to say, "This is going to be pretty tame 
stuff for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Watkins straps one of these Edwards jet jocks into one of his 
two-seater, aerobatic-ready gliders for a just-for-fun little joy ride. 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 minutes of a ride that seems to take a lifetime, the Edwards guy may 
look a little green. 
</P>
<P>
 He gets out of the glider, takes another look at Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins just grins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not pulling the five or six positive Gs that gets them," Watkins says. 
"They can do seven or eight positive Gs. They are used to that." 
</P>
<P>
 What is new to them are the 2 to 2 1/2 negative Gs that make you feel like 
you're being sucked out of the plane by the Mother of All Vacuum Cleaners. 
"That's a new experience," Watkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 (Positive Gs can be compared to the way gravity makes one feel heavier when 
hitting the top in a roller coaster. Negative Gs are the lighter sensations one 
has when hitting the bottom.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jet jocks are not the only ones who go on what he calls his Top Gun aerobatic 
spin. He offers the ride to the public, who for $60 get a few minutes of air 
time, a few minutes that you will never forget, according to Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
 If fun for you is flying upside down, end-over-end, inside-out, stalling and 
falling in a plane with no engine, this one's for you. 
</P>
<P>
 "How bad can it be?" asks Watkins innocently. "One of my best customers is a 
local 10-year-old girl who takes the trip about once every six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins owns and operates Crystal Soaring, located in Llano, about 15 miles 
east of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 He boards private gliders there, and also runs a school that teaches glider 
flying and aerobatics, as well as offering sight-seeing and aerobatic rides to 
anyone interested. 
</P>
<P>
 The $135 ride is the favorite and takes passengers up over the nearby San 
Gabriel Mountains where the view, on a good day, is clear to the Pacific, 
Watkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 But keeps this 71-year-old former Navy test pilot smiling are the aerobatic 
flights that he flies himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins is a California kid who was born in Pasadena and grew up in Alhambra. 
He is a U. S. Naval Academy graduate, Class of 1943. 
</P>
<P>
 Before going to flight school, he saw action in the Pacific as a lieutenant 
junior grade on the battleship Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was graduated from flight school, the war was over. 
</P>
<P>
 He became a naval test pilot, which is where he learned about thermal-powered 
aircraft. "The Navy used gliders to teach us how to get into and out of certain 
threatening situations," according to Watkins, who spent most of his military 
career jockeying around in high-flying hot rods with afterburners. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring from service, he went into the landscaping business in Virginia 
Beach, Md. "My dad had taught me about landscaping when I was a boy in 
California, so I decided that was what I would do," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he met and married his English-born wife, Monica, who had been a flight 
attendant for Pan Am for 20 years. They eventually got tired of winters in the 
East and moved west. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, we moved to Arizona, which was warm, but we were looking for something 
else," Monica Watkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, George saw an ad for Crystal Soaring in a flight magazine and we 
decided to have a look," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The glider field had been operational for 30 years, but, by then, she says, 
had become run down. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple bought it two years ago and set out to set it right. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in addition to the privately owned craft, they have eight gliders and 
three tow planes in residence as well as five pilots and/or instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have the only field in Los Angeles County offering aerobatic flying 
instruction, Watkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if you want to get your glider to do Cuban 8s, erect spins, loop-overs, 
Immelmanns and hammerheads, this must be the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins says he is currently tutoring three aerobatic students -- an 
orthopedic surgeon, an engineer and a Los Angeles Police Department forensic 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 He's looking forward to the day when his 10-year-old student has her pilot's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks she's a candidate, as well. It's a Mitzvah to Feed the Food Bank 
</P>
<P>
 At the recent bar mitzvah of 13-year-old Brian Finkelstein at Temple Aliyah in 
Woodland Hills, his parents, Allan and Bonnie Finkelstein of Calabasas, used 
cans of food instead of flowers for the table centerpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brian got his last hug and wish for a happy future, the cans were loaded 
in the family car and driven to a Reseda warehouse called Sova. From there, 
food is given out weekly to those in need. 
</P>
<P>
 The name Sova comes from the Hebrew word for a feeling of well-being and of 
being well-fed, says Jean Kaplow, director of Bay Cities Jewish Community 
Center, which manages the program. 
</P>
<P>
 For 11 years, Sova has been feeding the hungry, and every year the need and 
the volunteer staff grows, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplow adds that no one thought at the beginning of the program that this 
would be the way things would be. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we opened in Santa Monica in 1982, we thought we would be useful for a 
while, and then the need would fade away," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then we served about 100 people each month from our one location. Now we 
serve about 1,200 people a week from three different locations," Kaplow says. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest location is at 6027 1/2 Reseda Blvd. in Reseda. It opened in July. 
From there, food bags are given out each Wednesday between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. 
Staff members are volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no qualifying process for getting a food bag. If you are hungry, we 
want to give the food to you," Kaplow says. 
</P>
<P>
 The week the Reseda center opened, 50 people showed up for food bags. Now, 
several hundred show up each week, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 She says almost all the food is donated by individuals and organizations. 
Schoolchildren give fund-raisers. People bring in canned food. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplow says the best times, for her, come when she hears from those previously 
assisted who send a check and note that says, "You helped me, now I'd like to 
pass it on." Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, you can get a nose ring and butterfly tattoo, right after you 
start getting straight A's, graduate from law school and start sending money 
home."

MIKE PENNER: FOR SOME PLAYERS, GAME IS END OF AN ERA AT ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tale of two cities: 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, a rare sellout crowd at the Coliseum dances in the aisles, 
exulting in Jeff Jaeger's overtime field goal and a victory that sends the 
Raiders to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, a crowd of 39,147 -- bigger than the Freedom Bowl! -- dances in 
the aisles, exulting in T.J. Rubley's recording-setting 39th handoff to Jerome 
Bettis and a 20-6 victory over a quarterback-free zone known as the Chicago 
Bears, oblivious to the fact that their beloved Rams had just thrown away the 
No. 2 pick in the 1994 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodby, Heath Shuler, the touted "franchise quarterback" from Tennessee who 
doesn't expect to last until the fifth selection, where the Rams figure to pick 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodby, Trent Dilfer, too? The next-best quarterback on the draft board could 
go among the top three as well, which would leave the Rams to kick the tires of 
a few slightly used veterans (Chris Miller? Scott Mitchell? Mark Rypien?) and 
rue the day they decided to roll up two touchdowns and two field goals on the 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams and their fans did a lot of waving Sunday at Anaheim Stadium. 
Officially, it was Fan Appreciation Day, where lucky ticket holders were 
rewarded for their masochistic tendencies with such handsome parting gifts as a 
year's supply of ice cream and books of McDonald's gift certificates, the two 
staples of Bern Brostek's diet. But unofficially, it was Farewell To Rams Day, 
with many staples of the organization taking their final bows, whether they 
wanted to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Everett jogged through the tunnel that leads to the Ram locker room for 
the last time. His Anaheim career ended somewhere around Thanksgiving -- he 
took his final snap from center Dec. 5, 1993, in Phoenix -- and as Everett 
approached the tunnel, fans cheered him, possibly for having the good grace to 
step aside for Rubley. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett acknowledged the fans with a sheepish grin, a thumbs-up sign, even a 
hand slap or two. 
</P>
<P>
 What was going through his mind at that moment, one can only guess, because 
Everett's last postgame interview as a Ram was one of his shortest -- three 
words only: 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not today." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett could be going out, side by side, with his faithful favorite target, 
Henry Ellard, and his personal health insurance policy, Jackie Slater. They had 
shared some fine times together -- Slater stopping wild-eyed, snorting 
defensive ends cold in their tracks, buying Everett the split-second he needed 
to find Ellard isolated one-on-one in the secondary, time after time after 
time, until the watch finally broke in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard, 32 now, finishing his 11th NFL season, and Slater, 39, closing out his 
18th season, are unrestricted free agents. Both plan on playing next season, 
but where? Ellard and Slater are long in the tooth and long in the contract, 
two demerits in the eyes of the youth-leaning, economy-leaning Ram management 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to come back," Ellard said as he straightened the knot in 
his necktie. "I put in 11 years here, I'd like to stay here. But (the Rams) may 
have other plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the Rams may. Ellard led the team in catches (61) and receiving yards 
(945), but also led all Ram receivers in years on the planet. The Rams would 
like to get younger at the No. 1 receiver slot. Faster, too. Cheaper, better 
still. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater, meanwhile, spent Sunday afternoon in street clothes, the same way he 
has spent every Sunday since November, waiting for a torn pectoral muscle to 
heal. By training camp, it should be ready. Slater wants to be there. Rams 
Coach Chuck Knox wants him there, too, but Knox doesn't sign Slater's paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a money decision for the Rams -- and after 18 years in the 
organization, Slater knows what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 It could go either way, awaiting Hall of Fame bust or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, still a kid, refuses to consider any dark clouds on the horizon. 
Cutting off Slater before he hit the locker room exit, the rookie tailback 
wrapped a bear hug around Slater, let out a laugh and asked, earnestly, "You're 
comin' back, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna line it up one more time, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Slater smiled and said he hoped so, he hoped so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wouldn't want to come back and block for a guy like that?" Slater said as 
he headed out the door. "You'd give a lot of salt and sweat for that guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis is the future of this franchise. His 1,400 yards in his first season, 
his 39 carries Sunday -- these are just the beginning. The transformation of 
the Rams' offense from pass-first to run-first-second-and-third is under way, 
which bodes better for a veteran run blocker, such as Slater, than it does for 
a veteran pass catcher, such as Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck Knox has already expressed to me that he wants me back," Slater said. 
"I'm excited about that. We'll get down to working out all the wrinkles in time 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Based on my performance this year before the injury, I should be back playing 
for the Rams next season. I was very pleased with the season I had." 
</P>
<P>
 And Ellard? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got options," he said. "I'd like to play two or three more years. More 
than anything else, I'll be looking for a multiyear contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my stats speak for themselves. With everything that went on with our 
offense this year, playing with two quarterbacks with very different passing 
styles, I still had 61 catches. I'm happy with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ellard admitted to taking "a long look around" Anaheim Stadium Sunday 
because "it could be my last time in a Ram uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 He also shook hands with Everett. "We told each other, 'It's been a pleasure,' 
" Ellard said. "We've been through a lot of ups and downs together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think Jim can play in this league. He's a young guy with a strong 
arm. It's just a matter of him getting in the right situation. Put him in the 
right offense and he'll do well . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "He's ready for something new. He's ready for a change." 
</P>
<P>
 So are the Rams. The old gang, it isn't what it used to be. Breaking it up 
shouldn't be that hard to do.

RYAN PROVES THAT HE STILL PACKS PUNCH 
</P>

 Buddy Ryan punched Houston Oiler offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride during a 
sideline altercation Sunday night, giving a national television audience the 
ugliest manifestation yet of a feud that has been simmering all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, the fiery first-year Oiler defensive coordinator who has not hidden his 
disdain for Gilbride's run-and-shoot offense, appeared to exchange expletives 
with Gilbride shortly before halftime as the Oilers played the New York Jets, 
immediately after Oiler quarterback Cody Carlson lost a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbride took a few steps toward Ryan, who charged forward and struck 
Gilbride's cheek with his right fist. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were quickly separated, and the Oilers went on to win, 24-0, giving 
Houston its 11th consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difference in coaching philosophy in the heat of battle," Ryan told 
reporters after the game. "That's all I'll say about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbride declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there was another incident in the press box, apparently related to 
the one on the field, between receivers coach Charlie Baggett and quality 
control coach Frank Bush that was broken up by assistant general manager Floyd 
Reese. None of the three would comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ryan-Gilbride altercation occurred with the Oilers leading, 14-0, and 37 
seconds left in the first half. Instead of running out the remaining time, 
Carlson attempted two passes, losing the fumble on the second one. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan has been at odds with Gilbride from the beginning of the season, when 
Ryan was brought in to install his trademark intimidating, aggressive defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who calls Gilbride's offense the "chuck and duck," has publicly and 
privately blamed the Oiler offense for injuries to two key players: defensive 
backs Marcus Robertson and Bubba McDowell, both of whom were injured after 
Oiler turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buddy's an extremely emotional person on the sideline," said Jeff Fisher, who 
coached under Ryan in Chicago and Philadelphia and is now on the 49ers' 
defensive staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was around him for so many years that I was able to just let it pass. We 
once had a similar experience on the sideline, and he's the first one who 
addressed the team to say, 'Look, this is the heat of the battle stuff, and I'm 
going to react sometimes on the sidelines. I love you guys . . . and I'm going 
to react that way, so don't be shocked when it happens.' "

BOWDEN GETS LAST LAUGH IN POLLS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FLORIDA STATE IS VOTED NO. 1 
BY MEDIA AND COACHES, BUT NOTRE DAME IS A CLOSE SECOND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His Sunday morning photo session with the national championship trophy 
complete, Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden stepped to the podium, looked out 
into the crowd of reporters, many of whom had voted the Seminoles No. 1, and 
said, "I've been waiting a long time to say this: 'Men, I can't stand y'all.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And with that, Bowden let out a belly laugh, the kind that comes with having a 
USA Today/CNN coaches title in one pocket and an Associated Press title in the 
other. Bowden could afford to joke, especially since he no longer needed the 
weekly votes of the 62 media members or the 62 coaches who cast ballots in 
their respective polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seminoles claimed both shares of the national title, but it wasn't exactly 
a mandate. Of the 62 available first-place votes in the AP poll, once-beaten 
Florida State got 46, followed by No. 2-ranked Notre Dame with 12 and No. 4 
Auburn with four. If you are Bowden, so far so good. 
</P>
<P>
 But a look at the overall point totals revealed an electorate not entirely 
sure who truly was the best team in the nation: 12-1 Florida State, which 
squeaked past Nebraska, 18-16, in Saturday evening's Orange Bowl? Or 11-1 Notre 
Dame, which defeated the Seminoles during the regular season and defeated Texas 
A&M by three in the Cotton Bowl? Florida State earned 1,532 AP points, only 54 
more than Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 It was even closer in the coaches poll. There the Seminoles were rewarded with 
36 first-place votes and 1,523 points. No. 2 Notre Dame had 25 first-place 
votes and 1,494 points.  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess that (regular season victory against Florida State) didn't count for 
anything," Irish Coach Lou Holtz said from Dallas on Sunday morning. "Everybody 
said it was the Game of the Century. I guess it was the Game of the Century if 
the right team won." 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz went to bed late Saturday night thinking the Irish had earned at least 
half, if not all, of the national championship. In fact, after Notre Dame beat 
Texas A&M, the Irish players returned to their hotel and their fans cheered 
wildly when Scott Bentley's last-minute 22-yard field goal proved to be the 
game winner for Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think there was any possibility that we wouldn't win (the title) 
after what happened in '89," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Notre Dame ended the season 12-1, with its only loss coming at the 
hands of Miami, which finished 11-1 that year. Using head-to-head competition 
as the determining factor, the poll voters presented the national championship 
to the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz threw a fit back then, claiming that Notre Dame's season shouldn't be 
judged by the results of a single game. Of course, that was in 1989. Now, with 
his team in the exact opposite situation, Holtz has reversed his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reason, Lou Holtz is not always a popular coach with the media," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Texas A&M Coach R.C. Slocum: "Bobby is a grandfatherly kind of figure. I 
don't think you can find anyone in coaching to say a bad word about Bobby 
Bowden. There are some emotional feelings there. His teams are so close to 
winning it all every year, and they come up short. Your heart just goes out to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "So if it comes down to Bobby Bowden and Florida State or Lou Holtz and Notre 
Dame, there are coaches who will say, 'Let's give it to Bobby.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz might want to remember that Notre Dame entered Saturday's bowl game 
ranked fourth in both polls. And while the vote was closer among the coaches, 
the fact remains that his peers didn't think enough of the Irish to bump them 
above Florida State, despite the victory against the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, voters essentially were asked to make a choice between what was 
worse: Then-No. 1-ranked Florida State's seven-point loss to No. 2 Notre Dame 
at South Bend, or then-No. 1-ranked Notre Dame's 41-39 loss to visiting No. 16 
Boston College. Also included in the mix were bowl day performances. For 
instance, would it have made a difference had the Irish scored a more 
convincing victory against the seventh-ranked Aggies? And did it matter that 
Florida State's two-point victory came against a team rated higher than Texas 
A&M? 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden said he could empathize with Holtz, but after a 28-year wait, he wasn't 
about to decline the championship. "That's the way the poll works," Bowden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden wasn't afraid to do his part for the Seminoles. Taking advantage of the 
arbitrary and sometimes capricious poll system, the Florida State coach voted 
the Seminoles No. 1 and Nebraska No. 2 on his final ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe that was unfair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure was in marked contrast to his Orange Bowl postgame comments, 
when he said that Notre Dame, not Nebraska, was the second-best team in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the title is his, Bowden, 64, put an end to the rumors that he might 
resign. ESPN college analyst Lee Corso had suggested this very thing to the 
Seminole coach and later repeated the claim on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah, that don't interest me whatsoever," Bowden said. "I'd just like to coach 
as long as I can. I'm half serious about it, but after you retire, there ain't 
but one big event left." 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, Bowden will try to savor the weekend's big events -- a victory 
against a surprisingly tough Nebraska team on Saturday and a national title on 
Sunday. It won't be easy. Recruiting beckons. Holtz grouses. Critics continue 
to question the benefits of a system that features polls but no playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, Bowden will no longer have to carry the weight of never 
having won a championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I always felt is that one of these days my team would win a 
national championship," he said. "Yet I did realize I was running out of 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is simply running out of trophy space. It is a problem he can live 
with. The Final Polls

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS SEASON CAME DOWN TO A MISS-AND-HIT FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They dug in and said: "Please." Pawed the dirt. Clenched their fists. Crossed 
their fingers. Took their stances. Fanned out in formation, brothers in black, 
Lionel Washington, Eddie Anderson, Winston Moss, Howie Long, Joe Kelly, Anthony 
Smith, Todd Peat, Nolan Harrison, Aaron Wallace, Aundray Bruce and Derrick 
Hoskins, side by side, 11 angry men. "Please," they said to themselves, don't 
let our season be over. 
</P>
<P>
 Snap went the ball, smack went the kick and whoomp , there it wasn't. Eleven 
large Raiders disentangled from their men, whirled around and saw what they had 
prayed to see, a football kicked by Denver's Jason Elam floating to the wrong 
side of a Coliseum goal post. Dropping to his knees, Washington pounded the 
ground with his fists, his way of giving thanks. Moss punched the air. Harrison 
puffed up his chest and expanded his arms. Their season was alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Back stormed the Raiders, determined to win this thing now, determined not to 
let that damn John Elway or that damn Shannon Sharpe or any other damn Denver 
Bronco touch the football for at least another week. Onto the field jogged Jeff 
Hostetler, to transfer the ball to Denver's end of the field. Then onto the 
field jogged Jeff Jaeger, the kicker, and Jeff Gossett, his holder, to kick the 
ball right through the other goal posts and right into the AFC playoffs. And . 
. . whoomp , there it was, the lifesaver for Los Angeles, the super-saver, 
Jeff-propelled. 
</P>
<P>
 What began as the 500th game in the league history of the Raiders ended as one 
of their scariest and merriest, a truly cool, old-fashioned, American Football 
League kind of wild and crazy sucker, complete with 63 points, six touchdown 
passes, 671 passing yards, overtime, everything but Garo Yepremian or Franco 
Harris. Even the house was full, offering that rarest of rare sights, a Raider 
quarterback actually begging the crowd for quiet. Happy New Year, baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Davis, astoundingly calm, descended from his crow's nest afterward with a: 
"Magnificent effort by the guys. I knew we'd score." Which was a sight more 
than we knew, Al, babe, and more than 66,904 customers knew, more than a whole 
corral of Broncos knew and even more than most of his own employees knew, 
including even a hopeful romantic such as Jaeger, who chuckled and said he 
never had a doubt, ho, ho, ho. 
</P>
<P>
 He nailed it, Jaeger did, L.A.'s most consistent athlete, perhaps, pointing 
his foot toward its target accurately and hiding his acute anxiety beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was telling my wife, I've been on edge all week," Jaeger said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't the only one. Everybody in the stadium knew what was riding on this 
game, although only the ones with diplomas in quantum physics were able to 
compute the exact permutations that would put the Raiders in the playoffs. If 
the Dolphins lose by more than 27.9 points while the Steelers lose or tie or 
get lost on their way to the stadium while the Jets spin around three times and 
pin the tail on the donkey, then the Raiders qualify for the playoffs. 
Something like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning solved everything. And every man had a hand. If ever the Raiders 
gathered together as a unit and made a stand, this was the day. For they had 
more than their three Jeffs, far more. With the outcome of the overtime and the 
season on the line, there was Ethan Horton, struggling for an extra yard, 
refusing to go down, and there was Hoskins, taking no chances when a football 
finally got by Denver's Sharpe, giving him a whack just to be sure, and there 
was Gerald Perry, practically in a sumo deathlock with his man along the line 
of scrimmage, grappling over every inch of turf. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the scenes the players will be seeing this week in camp, where they 
will be preparing for Raiders-Broncos, Part II, rather than packing their 
belongings into cardboard boxes. Wait until the guys get another look at 
Alexander Wright waiting, waiting, waiting and finally springing to catch 
Hostetler's pass with no time -- none -- zero -- nada -- remaining in the 
season. What a touchdown this was, and what a toss by Hoss. "The highlight of 
my life," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another highlight they will enjoy will be that of Tim Brown, flapping his 
wings before the snap as though to get loose, putting a move on Tyrone Braxton 
that left him three steps behind, extending his arms in the end zone and 
snatching the ball high above his head, six points. He is the go-to guy teams 
need in football as much as they do in basketball, Tim Brown is. For a while 
there it was Hostetler-Brown versus Elway-Sharpe in a contest of Anything You 
Can Do, We Can Do Better. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the jerry-built backfield of Napoleon McCallum, that old 
salty dog, scraping off the barnacles and working hard for every yard, 
alongside Tyrone Montgomery, pushing himself and pushing forward for every 
precious inch, making runs that would have made his big brother Wilbert proud. 
It was this kind of effort, from unexpected sources, that even took the Broncos 
aback, as defensive back Dennis Smith had to concede when he said: "They just 
never gave up. They kept fighting. I never believed we could give it up like 
that, that they could score 33 points on us. Never." 
</P>
<P>
 They fought with words, Washington, Hostetler and others beseeching back judge 
Jim Poole to reconsider his decision to call a Raider receiver out of bounds. 
They fought with actions, Anderson saying after a hard day in the secondary, 
"We busted it out there today. I don't know what more we could have given and I 
don't know how much more we had left." 
</P>
<P>
 And they fought the NFL way -- with their feet. In this, the year of the field 
goal, Jaeger and his holder were so self-assured that on an earlier kick, 
Gossett gave Jaeger five before either of them looked to see where the football 
had gone. This is why Art Shell made reference to Jaeger as "the most 
determined individual I have ever been around," although, fact is, the coach 
could have said that Sunday about 45 or 50 individuals by his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger dashed from the field, hoisting his helmet triumphantly toward the 
crowd. After saying please, this was the best way a Raider knew to say thank 
you. It was a way of saying thanks for coming, and hey, let's all do this 
again, real soon.

BRONCOS REACH EVERY GOAL -- BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Denver Coach Wade Phillips tried his best to explain how the Broncos did 
nearly everything they wanted to do against the Raiders, but still lost 
Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get off to a good start by mixing things up on offense," said 
Phillips, whose team built a 27-10 lead late in the first half and a 30-13 lead 
early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to protect our quarterback (John Elway)," and the Broncos did not 
give up a sack after allowing seven in losing to the Raiders in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to stop their running game and force them into passing situations," 
and Denver gave up only 94 yards on the ground and forced Raider quarterback 
Jeff Hostetler to throw 41 times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, once the game went into overtime and we won the toss, we wanted to 
maintain possession and work the ball down the field," and the Broncos drove 52 
yards in six plays to the Raider 22 to start the overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
 So, how did the Broncos lose? "Basically, two plays killed us," Phillips said. 
"We didn't make the play on the last play of the game and then we didn't make 
the field goal when we had a chance to win the game in overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 In a game featuring many big plays, the two Phillips emphasized kept the 
Raiders' season alive and killed the Broncos' chances of opening the playoffs 
next week at Denver's Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The first one came with eight seconds left in regulation when Hostetler 
completed a touchdown pass to Alexander Wright over fallen Denver cornerback 
Charles Dimry to tie the score, 30-30. "If I could have made that play, 
obviously the game would have been different and we would have won," said 
Dimry, a seventh-year veteran from Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The next one came after two big overtime pass completions from Elway to Cedric 
Tillman that helped put the Broncos in position for a 40-yard field goal by 
rookie Jason Elam, who already had made three Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 With a chance to complete a perfect day, Elam's kick sailed wide left, setting 
up the Raiders' game-winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that I had hit it pretty good like I did on my other three 
attempts," said Elam, who had field goals of 52, 27 and 24 yards. "Then, I 
looked up and it went over to the left. I feel like I let everybody down. It 
was a very makeable field goal and I missed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Elam's miss gave the Raiders another chance, and they took advantage of it. 
They drove 49 yards in eight plays to the Denver 29, then Jeff Jaeger kicked 
his fourth field goal to win it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was nothing new to the Broncos. Jaeger also made a game-winning field goal 
to beat Denver in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jaeger beat us again," Phillips lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 As a reward for blowing this one, the Broncos get a return trip to the 
Coliseum on Sunday to play the Raiders in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great that we get to play them again," Phillips said. "I think 
that our whole team knows that we can beat them. But this time we'll know that 
we have to stop their passing game with Tim Brown and Hostetler. Brown just 
killed us today by making the big catches when they needed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown caught 11 passes for 173 yards and two touchdowns, and helped keep the 
Raiders close when it looked as if it would turn into a Denver rout. He caught 
three passes for first downs on the Raiders' 70-yard drive that sent it into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I didn't think they could drive on us and score," Phillips 
said. "They made every play they needed to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver (9-7) lost two games against the Raiders by a total of six points and 
has not won at the Coliseum since 1987. Next week, the Broncos will try again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things will be different next week," defensive back Tyrone Braxton said. 
"Just get your tickets."

QUARTERBACK GUESSING SEASON BEGINS FOR RAMS; FOOTBALL: WILL EVERETT RETURN? 
WILL RUBLEY BE THE ONE TO LEAD THE TEAM? NOTHING IS CERTAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a 5-11 record and their draft position in limbo, the Rams' season 
officially ended Sunday with a brief game of quarterback role reversal -- Jim 
Everett scrambling and T.J. Rubley sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Not on the field, but in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley, the starter, sat at his locker and answered questions after the Rams' 
20-6 victory over Chicago, while his backup, Everett, hurriedly packed his bags 
nearby and left Anaheim Stadium, perhaps for the last time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 In an exclusive post-game interview with The Times, did Everett have anything 
to say? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said, "not today." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett used those words to sum up the day, the season and perhaps even the 
past eight years with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 He was demoted six games ago in favor of Rubley, a ninth-round draft pick from 
Tulsa in 1992. The Rams had discussed releasing Everett earlier in the season, 
and it's still an option.  
</P>
<P>
 Everett's season ended Sunday unlike any other -- walking the sideline with 
his arms folded, wearing a baseball cap and greeting the offensive linemen as 
they came off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 It ended with Everett watching Rubley complete 18 of 28 passes for 213 yards 
and a touchdown against a Bears' defense ranked fifth in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 And it ended with the fans, many who had booed Everett earlier in the season, 
cheering and hanging over the railing to high-five him as he headed for the 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't quite the ending Everett or any of the Rams wanted -- at 5-11 
they took one step backward from last year in Coach Chuck Knox's rebuilding 
programs. And the team's collapse can be traced to Everett struggling through 
an 0-4 exhibition season, and his poor performances midway through the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim has had a lot of fond memories here, so I think it was tough for him," 
Rubley said. "We have tried not to hover over him, we let him have his space. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were me, it would be an emotional time." 
</P>
<P>
 Pending Everett's possible departure, it appears Rubley has control of the Ram 
offense -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will draft either fourth or fifth in April, and they might have a 
shot at taking Fresno State junior quarterback Trent Dilfer or Tennessee junior 
Heath Shuler, should they declare themselves eligible for the draft. Free 
agents such as Scott Mitchell, Chris Miller and Chris Chandler also are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has been consistent against Cleveland and Chicago the past two 
weeks, Rubley's future as the Ram starter is on somewhat shaky ground. Is he 
the Rams' starting quarterback of the future? 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't make that decision right now," Knox said. "He (Rubley) certainly is 
in the running." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley, insisting he wasn't ready to become a starter, reluctantly took over 
the offense in late October. After Rubley was sacked seven times in his debut 
at San Francisco, Knox yanked Everett out of the bullpen and started him in 
home games against Atlanta and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta intercepted two Everett passes in a 13-0 Falcon victory, and the 
offense was stuck in reverse against Washington until Rubley came in during the 
second half and threw a touchdown pass to Troy Drayton that gave the Rams a 
10-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley's performance that day earned him the starting job for the rest of the 
season, a position that left him feeling as awkward as a high school freshman. 
He failed to complete 50% of his passes in his next four starts, including a 
combined 10 of 28 against Phoenix and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 With rookie Jerome Bettis emerging as a Pro Bowl tailback, Rubley's most 
productive move on offense was to hand the ball off. As a passer, he was 
inconsistent, hitting Drayton for a touchdown in one game, then overthrowing 
him by 10 yards in another. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Rubley produced steady but not stunning numbers in his final two games, 
completing 42 of his final 60 passes (70%) for 507 yards with two touchdowns 
and two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't base my progress on the past two games because of the growing pains 
from the first three," he said. "That's experience. I'm just trying not to make 
the same mistake twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistakes Rubley no doubt will dissect during the off-season. A noted game-film 
junkie, Rubley plans to wear out the replay button on the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll watch a lot of films and break them down," he said. "I'll do some 
constructive criticism of myself and then move on."

<P>
 Only 35 fans turned out Sunday night to greet the West Virginia football team 
after its 41-7 loss to Florida in the Sugar Bowl the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised we even had any fans out here," sophomore tackle Vann 
Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the greatest fans in the country," offensive line coach Dave 
McMichael said. "They're loyal, good people. It's a shame we couldn't have 
played better. We shot ourselves in the foot."

 Said Edie Harper of Morgantown: "People supported them all through the year, 
but now where are they when they lose? Where are the true Mountaineer fans?"

FEDERATED BUYS SHARE OF MACY'S FOR $449 MILLION; RETAILING: IT HOPES TO 
EVENTUALLY MERGE THE TWO INTO A DEPARTMENT STORE GIANT. MACY'S CEO CALLS SUCH 
TALK 'PREMATURE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federated Department Stores Inc. said Sunday that it has bought a share of 
R.H. Macy & Co. with an eye toward eventually combining the two to become the 
nation's biggest department store company -- a scheme that Macy's chief 
executive quickly dismissed as "premature." 
</P>
<P>
 Federated said it closed a deal Friday with Prudential Insurance Co. of 
America to buy for $449.3 million half of the secured claim Prudential holds in 
the Chapter 11 reorganization of Macy's, the New York-based retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati-based Federated paid Prudential $109.3 million in cash, with the 
balance to be paid in three years plus interest, at a floating rate. Federated 
also took an option to buy the rest of Prudential's secured claim in Macy's 
within three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential's claim represents 15% of the overall debt in the Macy's 
reorganization. The insurance company had been Macy's largest single creditor. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated, which started the talks in the fall of 1993, said it negotiated the 
deal without Macy's knowledge. Federated's management told Macy's about its 
plans Sunday afternoon, Federated spokeswoman Carol Sanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive, said the purchase is 
a sound investment for Federated's shareholders and gives Federated a platform 
that could, with support of other creditors, lead to a combination of Federated 
and Macy's. 
</P>
<P>
 Questrom said Federated, which emerged in February, 1992, from two years in 
Chapter 11 reorganization, is aware that the complex bankruptcy process may not 
allow the two companies to combine. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's chairman and chief executive, Myron E. Ullman III, issued a statement 
Sunday saying the company was "not surprised there is interest in Macy's" in 
light of its progress in "restructuring the company and restoring it to 
financial health." But Ullman had no comment on Federated's plan for an 
eventual merger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Macy's has just begun the process of negotiating a plan of reorganization, so 
it is premature to discuss what implications today's announcement may have on 
the reorganization process," the statement said. "We look forward to working 
with all our creditors, who together have claims exceeding $6 billion, to 
arrive at a consensual plan of reorganization." 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's spokeswoman Laura Melillo said it was also too soon to comment on the 
potential impact of Federated's gambit on the Bullock's chain, a Macy's 
subsidiary that operates 20 stores in the western United States, many of them 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's had $6.3 billion in sales for fiscal 1993. The retailer operates 111 
Macy's and Bullock's department store branches, as well as I. Magnin, 
Aeropostale and Charter Club specialty stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated has $7 billion in annual sales, operating 219 stores in 26 states. 
Federated's store groups are Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus, the Bon Marche, 
Burdines, Goldsmith's, Jordan Marsh, Lazarus, Rich's and Stern's. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanger said it is premature to discuss what changes Federated would make if it 
acquired all of Macy's. Both companies are heavily concentrated in some 
markets, particularly New York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal makes Federated a creditor of Macy's. That allows Federated a voice 
in what happens to the privately owned Macy's as it tries to emerge from the 
bankruptcy reorganization it entered in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated's move represents a reversal of fortunes. In 1988, Macy's was an 
unsuccessful bidder to buy Federated. Federated, against its will, was bought 
that year by Canadian businessman Robert Campeau, before Campeau's real estate 
and retailing empire unraveled and sent Federated into Chapter 11. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Campeau takeover, Federated sold its I. Magnin and Bullock's store 
groups in California to Macy's.

SURVIVING BUT NOT THRIVING; COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE IS SHOWING SIGNS OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California's recession-weary commercial real estate market is slowly 
mending, analysts say, with vacancy rates inching downward and rents beginning 
to stabilize after a long plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of office buildings are also picking up as lenders slash prices to 
unload foreclosed properties and out-of-state investors look west for returns 
that are sometimes twice the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 About 28 large office projects worth a total of $450 million were sold in Los 
Angeles County in 1993, according to commercial broker Cushman & Wakefield, and 
half a dozen more deals worth nearly $100 million are in escrow. Only 23 
buildings, worth $292 million, were sold in all of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the WCT Building -- the triangular blue glass tower that has sat vacant 
and alone on the west side of the Harbor Freeway in downtown Los Angeles for 
nearly a decade -- was recently purchased by a group of optimistic investors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market is still paying a steep price for the excesses of the 1980s, 
when low vacancy rates and easy financing triggered an unprecedented 
construction boom and fast-rising prices attracted investors from around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really call our commercial market healthy," but it is getting 
better," said Richard Plummer, an investment broker in Cushman & Wakefield's 
downtown Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 Plummer said the Southern California market, like a hospital patient near 
death a year ago, "has been upgraded from 'flatline' to 'critical but 
improving.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even a modest rebound could have beneficial ripples, particularly in Los 
Angeles County, the state's most depressed area. New office tenants need 
furniture and equipment, places to eat and parking attendants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the rental market gets tighter, major new office projects are likely to 
appear -- a sight not seen in Los Angeles or Orange counties in more than three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, the two counties account for about two-thirds of Southern 
California's office space, and both are showing signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's office vacancy rate fell to about 18% in 1993 from 19.3% in 
1992, about in line with the national average, according to Grubb & Ellis 
Commercial Real Estate Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacancies are expected to drop another 1% in 1994 thanks to a modest pickup in 
demand and a dearth of major new construction projects, said Bob Bach, Grubb & 
Ellis' research director. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's vacancy rate stands at 19% -- down from 20% a year ago -- 
and is expected to drop to 18.5% in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But clearly, some parts of the basin's far-flung office market are faring 
better than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Building sales and rental rates are strongest in the Burbank area, where 
Disney Studios and other entertainment companies have been rapidly expanding 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacancy rates are dropping and rents are stabilizing in the huge downtown Los 
Angeles market, where landlords are offering space in newer buildings for about 
the same rent that tenants have been paying at older projects in other parts of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of downtown's newest business residents have come from the 
Mid-Wilshire area, a district still suffering from the 1992 riots that 
devastated nearby Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacancies also continue to climb in the South Bay, home to much of Los Angeles 
County's once-thriving aerospace business. 
</P>
<P>
 While the pickup in activity in downtown Los Angeles and Burbank is helping 
building owners in those areas, Bach said problems in Mid-Wilshire and the 
South Bay will hinder the entire region's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strong parts of the county just can't take off when there's so much space 
available in the weaker markets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although vacancy rates are still high enough to prevent most commercial 
landlords from raising rents, a handful of building owners are starting to cut 
back on the concessions they're willing to give new tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Overbuilding and high vacancies have pushed rents down more than 25% in most 
parts of Southern California over the past four years. To lure new tenants, 
landlords were forced to offer a variety of incentives -- from huge remodeling 
allowances to "signing bonuses" that put cash in the renters' pockets when a 
lease was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of those concessions are beginning to disappear as the market slowly 
tightens. 
</P>
<P>
 One year ago, insurance broker Willis Corroon signed a 10-year lease at a 
Glendale high-rise that locked in a $25-a-month parking fee for employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But only a month ago, brokers say, Home Insurance Co. agreed to pay $45 a 
month for parking spaces in the same building, and the owner can raise the fee 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Landlords in the stronger areas are beginning to make up some of the ground 
they have lost over the past few years," said Bill Boyd, a broker in the 
Glendale office of CB Commercial Group. "We should see rental rates start 
rising again by next fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts attribute the big increase in building sales last year primarily to 
the growing number of lenders who are cutting prices to unload their 
foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fire-sale prices have attracted investors from other parts of the United 
States, many of whom are betting on a California comeback to provide investment 
returns that far outpace those available in healthier markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The prolonged drop in commercial real estate values -- combined with a healthy 
dose of optimism about the market's future -- was the catalyst behind 
Taiwan-based Format Corp.'s recent purchase of the WCT Building at 1100 
Wilshire Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-rise, which has been virtually vacant since it opened in 1985, sits 
alone on the western edge of the Harbor Freeway and is a familiar sight to 
motorists as they cruise through downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately held Format paid about $18.5 million for the complex, which cost 
about $75 million to build a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was just too good of a deal for us to pass up," said Bob Caudill, the 
broker who represented Format and now has the task of trying to fill the 
37-story, 330,000-square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
 Caudill said he plans on marketing the complex under a new name, 1100 
Wilshire, because "the WCT name conjures up too many negative images." Slowly 
Healing 
</P>
<P>
 Vacancy rates for office space in all Southern California markets are dropping 
after years of mostly steady increases. The decline is expected to continue in 
1994, thanks to a gradual economic recovery and a dearth of new construction.

 Apple Computer Inc., after receiving a complaint from famed scientist Carl 
Sagan, has changed the internal code name for an upcoming model to "Butt-Head 
Astronomer" from "Carl Sagan," the San Francisco Chronicle reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagan asked the company to stop using his name after an article about the new 
computer appeared in MacWeek magazine, the newspaper said.

 The computer is one of three Apple models that will use the PowerPC 
microprocessor, which was developed by an alliance of Apple, Motorola Inc. and

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: QUESTIONS TO ASK AS THE NEW YEAR DAWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 1994. Do you know where your investment plan is? 
</P>
<P>
 While Wall Street is racking its collective brain trying to divine where stock 
prices and interest rates are heading this year, your task should be much 
simpler: Making sure you're positioned for any eventuality. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be far less difficult than you might initially suspect. If you stop 
worrying about what you don't know and just take care of the basics, investing 
-- at least, long-term investing -- becomes a fairly simple game. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new book, "Bogle on Mutual Funds," John Bogle, head of mutual fund 
giant Vanguard Group and a longtime champion of individual investors' rights, 
lists 12 commandments of investing. 
</P>
<P>
 The first one: "Never forget that investing is easier than it looks." 
</P>
<P>
 The second: "When all else fails, fall back on simplicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you're investing for the first time or looking to improve your 
existing portfolio's prospects, here are some basic questions to ask yourself 
as the new year begins: 
</P>
<P>
 * Do you have a plan? Rather than lose sleep worrying whether stock and bond 
markets are going up or down over the next 12 months, focus on your long-term 
goals. You should have some kind of investment plan for the future mapped out, 
either on paper or in your head. If you have a plan, the market's inevitable 
short-term gyrations won't freeze you into inaction. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, have you thought about how much you will be able to save and 
invest this year, realistically? Have you nailed down which investments you 
might like to buy (or buy more of)? 
</P>
<P>
 Are you prepared to make those investments -- in other words, have you done 
the necessary research? In the case of mutual funds, have you called the funds 
for applications and prospectuses so you have them on hand? 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming you are a long-term investor, probably the smartest thing you can do 
is to get on a dollar-cost-averaging plan, whereby you're investing small 
amounts on a monthly basis. That way, you needn't be concerned about market 
timing, and you're never at risk of investing too much at what turns out to be 
a market top. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're investing via your company's 401(k) retirement savings plan, you are 
already dollar-cost-averaging. Increase what you save via the plan, if 
possible. If you don't have a 401(k), many mutual fund companies will help you 
set up a regular investing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do you know what you own? Sounds simple. Yet many people accumulate 
investments over time, without thinking about how their entire portfolio fits 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Tally up your financial assets (including retirement accounts, but not 
including your home's value), then calculate what percentage is invested in 
stocks, in bonds, in short-term accounts (CDs, money funds) and in other 
investments. Does the mix make sense for you? 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the younger you are, the higher the percentage of your financial 
assets that should be invested in stocks at any given time -- because stocks 
offer the best long-term returns. As you age, more of your portfolio should be 
shifted to fixed-income investments, because those securities offer more 
stability along with regular income. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple rule of thumb is to subtract your age from 100. The resulting number 
is the percentage of your financial assets that should be in stocks; the rest 
should be either in bonds, short-term accounts or other assets, or a 
combination of them. (Note, however, that your personal situation may dictate 
having more or less in stocks than what the rule of thumb would suggest.) 
</P>
<P>
 * How diversified are your stock investments? With the U.S. market overall 
near record highs, you aren't diversified if your stock assets consist 
primarily of your employer's shares, or if you own just a single "growth-stock" 
mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a fund investor, many experts say you should own at least three 
distinctly different funds: one that invests primarily in stocks of major U.S. 
companies; one that invests mostly in smaller U.S. stocks, and one that invests 
in stocks overseas. There's virtually no excuse not to have at least three 
funds; nearly every major fund company offers those options, and minimum fund 
investments are mostly under $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 How you should allocate money among those three categories depends on how much 
risk you're willing to take. Aggressive investors might split that mix in 
thirds; more conservative types would probably limit the small-company and 
international funds each to 10% or 15% of their total portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 What if you're only beginning to diversify your stock fund dollars? Do it 
slowly, not all at once. For example, given the surge in international stock 
funds last year, they are vulnerable to a short-term selloff at some point this 
year, many pros agree. If you buy in slowly and regularly, you'll be assured of 
picking up shares during any selloff; if those markets keep rising all year, 
you'll be investing all the way up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do you have a hedge, should things go wrong? The U.S. bull market is 38 
months old, which is aged by historical standards. Likewise, interest rates are 
near 20- to 30-year lows, which suggests there is as good a chance of them 
rising this year as falling further, especially if the economy is robust. 
</P>
<P>
 So let's assume that rates move up, and that that sparks a selloff in U.S. 
stocks. Do you have a hedge -- an investment that might rise even as stocks and 
bonds slide, offsetting some of your loss? 
</P>
<P>
 For small investors, a hedge might be as simple as having 5% of your total 
portfolio in gold bullion (because gold, up 17% in price last year, could 
continue to benefit if investors take profits in stocks and bonds and look for 
an alternative.) 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Black, money manager at Delphi Capital in Boston, likes small U.S. 
energy stocks as a hedge. Oil sank in price last year, but if the economy is 
stronger than expected this year -- bad for interest rates, and possibly bad 
for many stocks -- energy prices could get a lift. Black likes such small 
exploration firms as Basin Exploration ($11.375 on Nasdaq) and Wiser Oil 
($17.50, New York Stock Exchange). 
</P>
<P>
 (Note also that many mutual fund companies offer funds that invest exclusively 
in natural resources companies. That's a way to bet on higher commodity prices 
in a strong economy.) 
</P>
<P>
 David Shulman, investment strategist at Salomon Bros. in New York, says that 
for most investors, "the best hedge is probably just to hold more cash than 
normal this year." That doesn't mean keeping 80% of your assets in a money 
fund. But it may mean holding 20% cash instead of 10%. A bigger cash hedge 
would offset a market decline -- and would assure that you have the money 
available to invest if stock and bond prices suddenly dive to bargain levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Could you live with a worst-case scenario? There are many reasons to think 
that 1994 will work out just fine for Wall Street -- that interest rates will 
rise slowly if at all, and that stock prices can advance (if fitfully) as the 
economy and corporate profits improve. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if the optimists are wrong? Could you sit through a classic bear 
market in stocks? 
</P>
<P>
 Count up the money you now have in stocks. If that sum suddenly lost 20% of 
its value, would it change your life? What about a 30% or 40% drop? 
</P>
<P>
 There have been 24 bear markets since 1897, and the average one has lasted 
14.5 months and sliced 34% off the Dow Jones industrial average, from peak to 
trough, according to the Chartist newsletter in Seal Beach. If you couldn't 
afford to see that percentage of your stock assets evaporate, then you should 
adjust your portfolio accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you sell some stocks and move the proceeds into cash. Maybe you don't 
want to invest more in the market until prices come down again, which they 
almost certainly will at some point. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Tsu, a certified financial planner at Professional Financial Advisors 
in San Juan Capistrano, reminds her clients that investors who bought at the 
stock market peak in August, 1987, waited two years to break even. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk to them and make sure they have at least that kind of time frame," 
Tsu says. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, bond investors should ask themselves how much of their principal 
value they're willing to sacrifice, should interest rates rise. Consider: A 
long-term Treasury bond that now yields 6.35% would lose about 10% of its value 
if market interest rates on new bonds rise to 7.35%. 
</P>
<P>
 You would still be earning your 6.35% on the older bond, regardless of what's 
happening with market rates. But if you can't stomach the idea of the bond 
itself being worth 10% less in price, then you should devise a plan to exit 
that investment well before it loses that much of its value. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the smart investor never buys a security without first asking: "How 
long am I planning to hold this? And what would cause me to sell?" A Checklist 
for Paranoid Investors 
</P>
<P>
 Is it time to sell stocks? Not yet, says market analyst Richard Eakle of Eakle 
Associates in Fair Haven, N.J. He has compiled a checklist of 20 indicators 
that tend to signal market tops. Of the 20, only two currently suggest a top is 
here, Eakle says. Here are 12 of his indicators (the other eight are more 
technical in nature). 
</P>
<P>
 * Does economic evidence indicate an approaching peak in the business cycle? 
NO 
</P>
<P>
 * Is inflation accelerating? NO 
</P>
<P>
 * Are corporate profits rising at an unsustainable rate? NO 
</P>
<P>
 * Are short-term interest rates on the increase? YES 
</P>
<P>
 * Has the Federal Reserve begun a more restrictive monetary policy? NO 
</P>
<P>
 * Is the stock market's aggregate price-to-earnings ratio near that of its 
previous cyclical peak? NO 
</P>
<P>
 * Are mutual fund cash reserves nearing historic lows? NO 
</P>
<P>
 * Have financial stocks peaked, only to fall off during successive rallies in 
recent months? YES 
</P>
<P>
 * Have markets exhibited successive rallies to previous highs, only to retreat 
without making substantive additional gains? NO 
</P>
<P>
 * Have corporate executives ("insiders") begun selling vs. buying their own 
stocks at a ratio exceeding 3 to 1? NO 
</P>
<P>
 * Is the number of NYSE issues trading above their 200-day moving averages 
nearing the historical danger level of 80%? NO 
</P>
<P>
 * Is private and/or professional investor sentiment markedly over-optimistic? 
NO

 Simplot Co. Buys Cattle Operation: An Oregon ranch believed to be one of the 
largest cattle operations in the nation has been sold to J.R. Simplot Co., an 
agricultural, food-processing and fertilizer company based in Boise, Ida.The 
Paisley-based ZX Ranch covers 73,000 acres of land, and has permits for grazing 
livestock on an additional 1.3 million acres of federal or private land. 
Simplot officials declined to reveal the price for the ranch, purchased last 
week from Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Tom Basabe, president of Simplot's 
agriculture group, said the company will continue cattle operations at the 
ranch, which produces about 10,000 head of cattle annually. Simplot employs 
about 9,000 people in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Annual sales of the 
family-held company average about $1.8 billion.

 Judge Says Former Penny Stock Dealer Should Pay $8.5 Million: U.S. Magistrate 
Richard M. Borchers recommended that Meyer Blinder pay the amount in damages to 
200 investors who claimed he defrauded them when he presided over Denver-based 
Blinder, Robinson & Co.The recommendation came in a lawsuit filed against 
Blinder, who is serving a 46-month prison term for racketeering, conspiracy and 
securities fraud. The recommendation must be approved by U.S. District Judge 
Edward Nottingham. Borchers said Blinder has 10 days to file a written 
objection. The investors say they lost money in two separate investment trusts.

Q & A: SAM M. INMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, INGRAM MICRO INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dean Takahashi, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not many would try to fill the shoes of Linwood (Chip) Lacy, who over eight 
years built Ingram Micro from a $100-million company to the world's largest 
distributor of personal computers and software with $4 billion in sales. But 
Sam Inman, 43, jumped at the opportunity. An ex-IBMer, Inman joined Ingram 
Micro in Santa Ana as president and chief operating officer in August. He'll 
replace Lacy, who received a promotion to the parent company in July as chief 
executive. Inman spoke with Times staff writer Dean Takahashi. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Computer distribution is not an easy business to understand. It's got its own 
jargon. When you meet someone new, how do you explain its workings to them? 
</P>
<P>
 I've had the problem in two dimensions. My friends and family ask me what is 
it that I really do. Others are business associates. I think that a growing 
number of people in the business world understand distribution better than I 
would have guessed. What usually helps is this vision of a pipe. At one end of 
the pipe are the computer manufacturers and vendors, from computer-maker Compaq 
Computer Corp. in Houston to software publisher Microsoft Corp. in Redmond, 
Wash. At the other end are the computer resellers, who sell the merchandise in 
the marketplace to the computer users. At the middle of the pipe is us. The 
concept of drawing product from the vendors and getting it to the resellers and 
getting information from the resellers back upstream to the vendors -- that's 
the way I describe what we do. We buy from the vendors and we supply it to 
resellers, who sell it to users. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Can you explain how rapidly the distribution business is changing? 
</P>
<P>
 I would say that computer distribution started entering a really rapid period 
of change and growth in 1989. The personal computer industry was growing 
rapidly. Secondly, as the profit margins at the vendor level and the reseller 
level became smaller, the resellers had a burning desire to get rid of the 
inventory and have someone else carry it because of cost and risk of 
obsolescence. They started moving the inventory upstream to the middle of the 
pipe. We carry the risk and provide the credit. Thirdly, most of the 
manufacturers, or vendors, started thinking about how they could get more 
product into the marketplace, how they could reach beyond traditional customers 
and their traditional sales force. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As far as executive or managerial challenges, what interested you in 
distribution? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what my wife kept asking me. I had been on one end of the pipe as a 
vendor in the personal computer business for almost two years. Quite frankly, I 
was interested in it because being in the middle of this equation, or pipeline, 
is the most exciting business. You're positioned very well to bring value 
upstream to the vendors and downstream to the resellers. I like that, and I 
like the pace of the PC industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chip Lacy has been described as energetic. Did you know you could work with 
him? 
</P>
<P>
 That's one way of describing him. You know how hard it is to take a job with a 
company you've only read about and interviewed with. My advantage was I had 
worked with this company as a business partner for a couple of years. I knew 
Chip and all the players here. Chip and I are different in a lot of ways and 
similar in a lot of ways. Where he had strengths, I had weaknesses and vice 
versa. And David Dukes, co-chairman, is a third dimension of it. He grew up in 
the reseller side of the pipe, and I grew up in the vendor side. That adds 
interesting perspectives to it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Did you come aboard with a particular plan to change the management style or 
strategy of the company? 
</P>
<P>
 No. It's a question I'm often asked. I did not. I'll tell you what my 
objective has been. I think it's a mistake for people to come into any 
organization with a preconceived notion of what the organization is. I also 
think it's a mistake to bring too much baggage from any place else and start 
applying it. I think it's a much more interesting personal challenge to take 
what you know and make changes to yourself that fit. I've tried to learn and 
listen for 90 days and see what I could apply that would make sense or help 
this company.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chip dominated the management style. Do you think that's why there was no 
chief operating officer before you? 
</P>
<P>
 I think one of Chip's strengths is that he knows what he doesn't know. I think 
that Chip was probably one of the people who realized that he needed a chief 
operating officer. I think that you have to pick the right kind of person with 
the right skill set. If you don't bring anything to the management team, then 
there is no room for you. I do believe that Chip's aggressive style could scare 
a lot of candidates away from a job like this. That didn't bother me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What technologies or classes of products will do well next year? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think personal digital assistants, or hand-held computers that serve 
as electronic calendars or messaging systems, will come into their own. They're 
not ready. Notebook and sub-notebook computers -- portable computers small 
enough to fit into briefcases -- will continue to grow fast. The high-end 
server products, which run corporate networks of computers, will grow in both 
the hardware and software markets. I also think the market will continue to 
grow because of the home computer boom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram is expected to hit sales of $5.4 billion next year. What is driving the 
growth? 
</P>
<P>
 The same things driving the industry: The demand for personal computers by 
corporate America and the home consumer; resellers wanting us to get products 
to market faster and hold their inventory; manufacturers wanting us to reach 
new markets for them. Some of the business ventures that we began to produce in 
1992 and 1993 should start to produce revenue for us, such as configuration 
services -- where we set up the computer for a custom software setting. We had 
a small configuration center and have expanded that. That is part of the whole 
outsourcing trend, something we can do more efficiently and cheaper than the 
resellers.

O.C. ENTERPRISE / JAMES M. GOMEZ: CAMPAIGN IDEA GIVES MAN OWN 'CABINET' POST; 
LAGUNA HILLS RESIDENT WAS INSPIRED BY CLINTON'S HEALTH CARE PLANS TO BEGIN 
CUSTOMIZING MEDICAL OFFICES FOR THE FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the 1992 presidential campaign raged on, Craig La Croix found inspiration 
where others heard only rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 La Croix, 33, had been looking to increase sales for his custom cabinetmaking 
business. He was experiencing a modicum of success with van conversion work, 
turning empty metal shells into luxurious, mobile dens by adding cabinets and 
carpeting to the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when La Croix, a former middle manager at defense and 
telecommunications companies, began listening to then-candidate Bill Clinton 
hammer away on the necessity for health care reform. Where some saw political 
posturing, La Croix saw potential profit. 
</P>
<P>
 From there came the birth of SMP La Croix Inc., a maker of customized dental 
and medical office cabinetry and furniture. The Laguna Hills resident 
accurately predicted that all the talk about health care reform would fuel an 
industry boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors and dentists receiving more patients would need to expand and improve 
their offices, he figured, and could use his expertise in creating and building 
ergonomically correct and efficient office environments, from desks and shelves 
to countertops and laboratory work stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a niche that was not really being fulfilled," La Croix said, adding 
that the majority of medical offices are equipped with prefabricated cabinetry 
and furniture. "And with all the talk about health care, I thought it was the 
time to make a move on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Through word of mouth, La Croix has steadily built up his small business over 
the past 18 months, bringing in $165,000 in 1993 -- that's up from $140,000 in 
revenue last year, which then included van conversion revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Samira Rami, an office manager for Westminster dentist Samuel Marcus, said her 
boss decided in February to revamp his front office and add much-needed storage 
space. He called La Croix, who worked after office hours to measure and install 
new gray-faced cabinets, a desk and a front counter. The job was completed 
within a week, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really a hard-working guy. He did a great job," said Rami, adding that 
Marcus was so impressed that he referred La Croix to several colleagues, which 
led to additional jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting a business during one of Southern California's most crushing 
recessions may not be an ideal strategy for a budding entrepreneur -- 
especially for those who are minorities such as La Croix, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
 "Access to markets and capital are two major problems for small business 
owners," said Aaron Lovejoy, a board member of the Orange County Black Chamber 
of Commerce. "It's particularly acute for minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting on a shoestring, even in the best of economic times, is tenuous at 
best, said Lovejoy, who owns UltraTech Resources Inc., a Santa Ana computer 
products distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 But La Croix is undaunted by the challenges. "It started with vanity, but I 
knew I could do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once an inventory manager for a subsidiary of Canadian telecommunications 
giant Northern Telecom Ltd., La Croix decided to abandon big business three 
years ago for the satisfaction of owning and managing his own business -- no 
matter how small. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the talents of local cabinetmakers on a per-job basis, La Croix started 
his van conversion business. He contracted with cabinetmakers at woodworking 
shops in Placentia, Santa Ana, Huntington Beach and Long Beach and began 
cranking out walnut, rosewood and teak cabinets for vans. 
</P>
<P>
 His idea of moving into dental and medical cabinets began when he did a series 
of storage cabinets for his ex-wife's dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, La Croix said he averages about two contracts a month, valued from 
several hundred to several thousand dollars. He said that's busy enough for a 
one-man operation. La Croix finds the clients, subcontracts the actual 
construction, then helps install the furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 In time, La Croix said he should have enough orders to hire full-time workers, 
and begin giving something back to the community in the form of wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovejoy suggested that La Croix soon must expand if he has any hope of 
survival. "The only way he is ever going to grow is to bite the bullet and get 
somebody to either work the projects or do the marketing for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovejoy also advised La Croix to aggressively seek out subcontracting 
agreements with contractors who work on hospital projects and large clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 After having a solid job with a corporate employer, La Croix is only just 
getting used to living hand-to-mouth, trading security for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't grow up poor," said the La Puente native, "but I wasn't rich either. 
So I know I can survive."

NEW INGREDIENTS FOR KARCHER ENTERPRISES BOARD; CORPORATION: MORE CHANGES OF 
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED THIS YEAR AS THE FAST-FOOD COMPANY TRIES TO REVERSE 
THREE YEARS OF SAGGING SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 52 years, there was no doubt that company founder Carl N. Karcher had a 
firm grasp on the chairman's suite at Carl Karcher Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Karcher, now 76, who ran the company, selected the directors and 
handled advertising as the Carl's Jr. pitchman. But given recent developments, 
Karcher Enterprises might have to install a revolving door on the chairman's 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 1, that handpicked board of directors ousted Karcher as chairman and 
replaced him with longtime friend and board colleague, Elizabeth A. Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-December, Sanders denied a report that she planned to resign as 
chairwoman during the company's annual meeting in June. But Sanders added that 
she would step aside if that was what a majority of board members wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a financially crippled Karcher gained an ally in Orange County 
businessman William P. Foley II, who headed an investor group that became the 
dominant force in the company and won two new board seats. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sanders talked about her future role, Foley volunteered that he was a 
"logical" choice to lead the company, although he previously had said he had no 
plans to take the top seat. Sanders acknowledged that Foley could be elected 
chairman easily if he wanted the post. 
</P>
<P>
 And who does Karcher -- who has since been invited back as chairman emeritus 
-- envision sitting in the office? "That's not something I'm going to talk 
about," said the man who typically offers an opinion on just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the speculation, some members of Foley's investor group wondered 
aloud if there was even a need to fill the chairman's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors at Karcher Enterprises will likely change during the 
coming year. After awarding seats to Foley and fellow investor Daniel D. (Ron) 
Lane, the company expects to see at least one board member resign during 1994 
-- possibly before the annual meeting in June. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only certainty for Carl's Jr. is that the new year will generate 
additional uncertainty -- not welcome news for a restaurant chain that is 
struggling to reverse a three-year sales decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises reported a $1.5-million profit for the third quarter that 
ended Nov. 1, but revenue continued to fall and sales at restaurants open for 
more than a year were off 7.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald E. Doyle, the company's president, hopes to reverse that slump by 
cutting corporate costs, trimming the chain's cluttered menu and introducing 
new entrees that are more likely to sate the public's appetite for better food 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle blamed the revenue drop on "recessionary factors" in California, where 
most of the chain's 649 units are. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics maintain that the company is generating profits by cutting costs 
faster than sales are falling. "You can only cut costs so much," said Andrew 
Puzder, Carl Karcher's personal attorney. "At some point, if sales don't go up, 
you'll be losing money." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle continues to have the support of a strong majority of the company's 
nine-member board. And Karcher and Foley support the cost-cutting move. 
</P>
<P>
 While the boardroom dispute at Karcher Enterprises has dominated Orange County 
business news pages, it's unlikely that the dispute will have a long-term 
impact on the chain's sales, said Miles Turpin, chairman of Grey Advertising, 
the Los Angeles-based advertising agency that recently won Karcher Enterprises' 
advertising account. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless product quality or service suffers, most consumers are not drawn into 
corporate tiffs, he said. That was the case when Turpin handled advertising for 
a Southern California company that declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone (at that company) was so sensitive about the bankruptcy, but all the 
market research showed that almost no one (outside the company) knew about it," 
Turpin said. "So often, these things that are traumatic for the company are not 
a big deal for anyone outside. Besides, Carl Karcher is back as chairman 
emeritus, so it should be a non-issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's big challenge is not only to provide "damn good fast food as it 
always has done, but to address concerns about prices," Turpin said. "People 
have always said the food tastes great. But in tight times, people are saying 
that (Carl's Jr. is) getting pretty expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Will Karcher Enterprises' founder return to his role as television pitchman 
for the Carl's Jr. chain, along with the company's Happy Star symbol? 
</P>
<P>
 Turpin and company officials have declined to comment on upcoming advertising 
strategies. But Puzder said the company founder is ready to do whatever he can 
to help reverse the sales decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations to determine Karcher's job description and salary are under way, 
and a resolution is expected in the next few weeks, Puzder said. 
</P>
<P>
 If revenue continues to fall, the new board will have to devise additional 
strategies that will help Carl's Jr. reclaim market share lost to stronger 
competitors such as McDonald's and Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
 Some restaurant industry observers maintain that Karcher Enterprises must add 
some new menu items, a prospect that could reopen the door to Karcher's plan to 
test-market Mexican-style food products from Anaheim-based GB Foods. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Karcher's demand that the company test-market Green Burrito brand 
products that ultimately led to the board dismissing the founder as chairman. 
Karcher has declined to say whether he intends to press the company to 
reconsider the Green Burrito idea.

NEW FIRM LEADS MARKET FOR BETTER MOVIE SOUND; FILM: WITH STEVEN SPIELBERG 
GIVING IT A BIG BREAK, DIGITAL THEATER SYSTEMS' SEPARATE CD FORMAT HAS A SHOT 
AT BECOMING THE STANDARD IN THEATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To start a new business in the closed, clubby world of Hollywood, you need 
money and connections. When Terry Beard developed a new digital sound format 
for movies, he had both. 
</P>
<P>
 Beard is a Caltech-trained engineer who spent 20 years inventing much of the 
stereo optical recording equipment used in movie production. He got a friend, 
who was also a friend of director Steven Spielberg, to help arrange a 
demonstration for Spielberg of a new movie sound system he invented called 
Digital Theater Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 As Spielberg watched and listened to scenes of his "Close Encounters of the 
Third Kind" in DTS, he was converted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was flabbergasted," Spielberg said. He recalls switching back and forth 
from the traditional soundtrack to DTS. "It sounded exactly like 70-millimeter 
six-track sound." 
</P>
<P>
 But Spielberg worried about one thing: The DTS format stores the movie digital 
sound track on a separate compact disc. If the disc became separated from the 
film, or failed, would his movie become a silent film? DTS argued that its 
system was fail-safe; if the digital sound track didn't work, the traditional 
analog sound track would kick in. 
</P>
<P>
 As Spielberg prepared the release of "Jurassic Park," the director told 
Universal Studios he wanted the sound track of his blockbuster-to-be in DTS. So 
Universal bought $4 million worth of DTS hardware to equip 1,000 theaters for 
the digital sound version of "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 It was DTS' big break. The dinosaur epic lent credibility to the format, and 
in July Spielberg bought a minority stake in Beard's Westlake Village-based 
Digital Theater Systems company, as did Universal Studios. Universal and 
Spielberg's production company, Amblin Entertainment, soon committed to release 
all their pictures in DTS. Spielberg's current film, "Schindler's List," is 
also using the format. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Beard, who is president of DTS, is competing with Dolby Laboratories Inc. 
and Sony to emerge as the dominant digital sound system for movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, Dolby, based in San Francisco, has been marketing its Dolby Stereo 
Digital sound for movies. Sony, parent of Columbia Pictures, TriStar and Sony 
Pictures Classics, is also competing with its Sony Dynamic Digital Sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolby said there is little difference in the sound quality between its system 
and DTS. But it believes the presence of its digital sound track on the film 
print, rather than on a separate disc, is an advantage. "There have been many 
examples of film technology in the past, such as the early talkies, where film 
and sound were on separate components. They can become separated," said Joe 
Hull, a spokesman for Dolby. 
</P>
<P>
 However, DTS claims that its system is safe, and that by using CDs for sound 
studios will save money when they dub their films for overseas markets, rather 
than having to have another film print made. 
</P>
<P>
 With the backing of Spielberg and Universal, DTS is gaining ground against its 
competitors. By the first week of January, DTS' digital sound equipment will be 
in 2,000 theaters worldwide, according to the company. That's compared to Dolby 
Stereo Digital's presence in 500 theaters worldwide. Sony won't officially be 
in the marketplace until spring 1994, but it has been testing its prototypes 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio and movie theater executives believe only one digital movie sound 
format will prevail and they predict a shake-out within two years. Exhibitors 
don't want to buy multiple pieces of equipment, so many are holding back to see 
which format becomes the standard.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're all searching for efficiency. This smorgasbord isn't acceptable," said 
Greg Rutkowski, vice president of western operation for AMC Theaters, the 
Kansas City, Mo.-based theater chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our philosophy is that digital sound and DTS will be the standard release 
format," said Bill Neighbors, DTS' vice president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the compact discs people listen to at home, digital movie sound tracks 
offer crystal clear tones delivered with the help of computer technology. Since 
CDs are impervious to wear and tear, the sound track doesn't have the hisses 
and pops associated with traditional movie sound. 
</P>
<P>
 With DTS' six-channel system, the film carries a time code to keep the sound 
track in sync with the movie. So far, DTS has had only a few instances in which 
the digital sound has cut out briefly, according to Neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors estimates that DTS will post sales of $6 million for the 10 months 
ending December 31. Next year, Neighbors expects sales to climb to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without its competitors, DTS must overcome bad memories left by the 
digital movie sound pioneer. In 1990, now-defunct Optical Radiation Corp., put 
its digital sound format on Walt Disney Co.'s "Dick Tracy" and Paramount 
Pictures' "Days of Thunder," plus a few other films. There were a few 
well-publicized incidents in which that digital sound track failed. And because 
there was no back-up, the movies went silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Once burned, Hollywood studios have been reluctant to sign on with another 
digital sound format. 
</P>
<P>
 But movie director Steve Kloves, who did "The Fabulous Baker Boys," saw a DTS 
presentation and liked it. So he pushed to use it in his Paramount film, "Flesh 
and Bone." So far, Paramount is approaching this on a picture-by-picture basis. 
"I like the digital sound system on "Flesh and Bone," said studio senior vice 
president Paul Haggar. "But that doesn't mean we won't use Dolby in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 New Line Cinema has signed on to release six pictures using the DTS process. 
"DTS seems to be trouble-free and it's relatively inexpensive for exhibitors," 
said Mitch Goldman, New Line president of marketing and distribution.

 Saudi Arabia Slashes Public Spending: Saudi Arabia, the world's largest 
exporter of crude oil, has announced it will cut public spending in 1994 to 
make up for losses in revenue caused by weakening crude prices. King Fahd 
projected government spending in 1994 at $42.6 billion, down from $52.5 billion 
set for 1993."The world economic conditions and surplus oil supplies have 
affected prices and imports from our country, so the (oil) prices dropped," 
Fahd said. "We expect the situation to change in the not-too-distant future if 
all (oil) producers sincerely cooperate, which we hope will be attained." That 
was a clear reference to an offer by Saudi Arabia and its five partners in the 
Gulf Cooperation Council to lower their oil output if other oil-producing 
nations did the same. The GCC nations are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the 
United Arab Emirates, Oman and Bahrain.

</P>
<P>
 Company: Wow!  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up: "I like coming up with new ways to make learning fun for other 
people. I particularly enjoy designing learning games and interactive learning 
software." 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs down: "As an independent consultant, I sometimes spend more of my time 
generating business than actually designing instructional programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Job description: An instructional designer develops the materials used to 
train employees. The job includes figuring out what the employees need to learn 
and how. It includes not only designing and writing the materials, but 
selecting the best learning method. This could be something as simple as a 
reference card, a workbook and an on-the-job trainer's guide, a group 
simulation, a custom video, CD-ROM or interactive multimedia software program 
designed for the particular skill being taught. Designers are responsible for 
all phases, from idea to completion, including evaluating the training results. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Next step: "I'd like to set up an innovative training department from scratch. 
I'd also like to become more involved in interactive educational software 
design." 
</P>
<P>
 Advice: "Join and become active in at least one professional organization. The 
scope of knowledge in this field is constantly changing and professional 
organizations help you to keep up." 
</P>
<P>
 Salary range: Salaried instructional designers in Orange County earn $30,000 
to $50,000 a year. Independent designers earn about $300 to $600 a day.  
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Those employed by corporations work standard office hours. Independent 
consultants often spend additional time during evenings and weekends completing 
projects and handling business aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Educational and training requirements: Most instructional designers have at 
least a bachelor's degree in education, education technology or communications. 
Larger firms often require an advanced degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected demand: Increasing. Technological changes and corporate restructuring 
have created an ongoing need for work force retraining. 
</P>
<P>
 Major employing industries: Medium- to large-size corporations, government 
agencies and nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information: Contact the Orange County chapter of the National 
Society for Performance and Instruction (NSPI) at (714) 962-7973 or the

 Patent Law Revisions OKd: The Legislature approved the changes, completing a 
package of improvements in the protection of intellectual property sought by 
Washington. Revisions in the law allow for better protection of patents in the 
food, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, extended patent terms and 
steeper fines for patent violators, said Robin Winkler, a U.S. patent attorney. 
The toughening of legal protection for patent holders under the new law marks 
the latest in a series of recent improvements in intellectual property 
protection by Taiwan after pressure from the United States.

 Report on '94 Waxes Pessimistic: The internal Mitsubishi Bank report predicts 
that Japan's faltering economy is likely to get even worse next year, Nikkei 
English News reported. The report, obtained by the Nihon Keizai newspaper, says 
its pessimistic forecast holds even if the government of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa is able to pass a tax cut and more public works spending. It 
says that overcapacity and low profitability developed in the heedless 
expansion of the late 1980s is still haunting the economy.

TRENDS FOR '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A look at some of the new and ongoing market trends that could affect your 
investment portfolio in 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 Can Last Year's Winners Repeat? For investors who like to bet on stock themes, 
the big winners in 1993 were companies whose fortunes rise with a stronger 
economy. With U.S. growth continuing to accelerate, the economy-sensitive 
groups remain the best bets for 1994, many Wall Street pros say -- though they 
allow for the possibility of some profit-taking in these groups some time in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's top stock group, according to Standard & Poor's Corp.'s rankings 
of 87 industry groups: hotels and motels. The average lodging stock shot up 
84.3% for the year. Big winners included Hilton Hotels, up 40% to $60.75 as of 
Friday; Promus Cos. (which owns Harrah's hotels), up 149% for the year; and 
United Inns, a Holiday Inns franchisee, which surged 232% to $7.875. 
</P>
<P>
 The lodging industry has finally begun to bounce back nationwide, as demand 
has slowly absorbed the glut of rooms built in the 1980s. "Hotel construction 
has finally tapered off while room demand continues to improve, boosting 
occupancy rates across all geographic, service and location sectors," Mark 
Manson, lodging analyst at DLJ Securities in New York, said in a recent report. 
"This trend paves the way for higher room rates and improved profits." 
</P>
<P>
 It also doesn't hurt that major hotel companies such as Hilton and Promus are 
heavily involved in gaming -- a business that remains red hot, and one in which 
the major players are likely to grab market share as weaker upstarts (such as 
the horde of small riverboat gaming enterprises) eventually fall by the 
wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-best stock group of 1993: gold mining companies, up 81.3% on 
average. Though inflation remains well under control, gold's price jumped 17% 
last year, to $390.80 an ounce by Dec. 31, as some investors sought a hedge in 
case the inflation outlook deteriorates. Rising jewelry demand for gold in the 
Third World also boosted the metal. Because gold mining stocks have sharply 
outperformed bullion's price, however, some analysts say the better bet now may 
be the metal rather than the stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among industrial groups, auto stocks rode surprisingly strong sales to new 
highs, semiconductor companies cashed in on the continuing computer sales boom, 
and diversified machinery companies (including Caterpillar and Deere) 
continually stunned investors with the magnitude of their earnings turnarounds 
after several dismal years. 
</P>
<P>
 William Dodge, investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, says 
U.S. industrial stocks still have life left, in part because so many foreign 
manufacturers are looking to locate plants on U.S. soil -- which should boost 
demand for machinery and other capital goods. "The domestic capital spending 
boom spurred by the 'Coming to America' of BMW, Volkswagen, Hitachi, Honda and 
Mercedes-Benz favors a broad range of producers of nuts and bolts, pumps and 
valves, compressors and electric switches," Dodge says. His favorite 
industrials include Emerson Electric ($60.25 now), General Electric ($104.875) 
and Ingersoll-Rand ($38.25). 
</P>
<P>
 What about 1993's losers -- primarily health care and consumer products 
stocks? Bargain hunters may think they're having a field day here, but many 
Wall Streeters remain cautious about the stocks, given the pending health care 
reform debate and consumers' unwillingness to pay brand name prices these days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Are Growth Stocks Still Vulnerable? Many high-flying growth stocks in the 
telecommunications and high-technology fields were hit by sharp selloffs in the 
fourth quarter. Greg Smith, investment strategist at Prudential Securities in 
New York, warns that the turmoil may not be over for those growth issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith figures it this way: Investors were willing to pay 50 to 100 times 
annual earnings per share for promising young growth companies in 1993 because 
the number of great earnings stories in the market was relatively small. 
Sliding interest rates for much of the year also lifted the upper range that 
investors were willing to pay for these stocks, because low interest rates mean 
investors have fewer decent alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the economy improves this year, Smith says, more companies will show 
significant earnings gains. Hence, "the idea of the relative scarcity of very 
high-growth companies' earnings is less compelling," he says. That means the 
stocks' stratospheric price-to-earnings (P-E) ratios will come down, Smith 
argues. "In such a period, high-growth companies can beat investors' earnings 
expectations and still watch their stocks go down because of shrinking 
valuations," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral: Be wary of paying excessively high P-Es, no matter how promising a 
company's prospects. (FYI: The current P-E on the average big name stock, based 
on estimated 1993 earnings, is in the 17-to-20 range, depending on whose 
estimates you believe.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Watch Inflation -- Not Commodity Prices: Prices of many basic raw materials -- 
from lumber to cotton to sugar -- surged last year, as demand (or perceived 
demand) outstripped supplies. Yet inflation at the consumer level remained 
under 3%. What gives? 
</P>
<P>
 Suresh Bhirud, market strategist at Bhirud Associates in Stamford, Conn., 
argues that competitive pressures are forcing many companies to eat commodity 
price increases rather than pass them on in the form of higher product prices. 
In part, that is what the powerful push to improve corporate efficiency has 
been preparing companies to do since the late 1980s, he notes. And that 
efficiency drive now has extended from manufacturers to retailers, who are 
locked in a heated battle for consumers' dollars.

 While prices of many commodities have jumped, Bhirud says, food and drink 
producers such as General Mills and Anheuser-Busch are actually cutting product 
prices, not raising them. Likewise, he notes, telecommunications companies are 
battling for market share by discounting like mad, and electronics retailers 
and home-furnishing retailers are doing the same. The bottom line, says Bhirud, 
is that investors shouldn't assume that a continuing rise in commodities will 
result in higher inflation that would wreak havoc with stocks and bonds.

 Many Insiders Remain Bullish: When corporate executives are heavy sellers of 
shares in their own companies, it's usually a bearish sign for the market. 
After all, who should know better than the insiders if their stocks are 
expensive or cheap relative to near-term earnings prospects? The good news as 
the new year dawns is that insiders aren't bearish, even though stock prices 
are at or near record highs, says Robert Gabele, whose Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., 
newsletter CDA/Investnet Insiders' Chronicle tracks insider transactions. "We 
continue to be intrigued by the number and dollar size of big insider purchases 
going on," Gabele says. "This high level of insider buys can hardly indicate a 
climate where fundamentals (of companies) are deteriorating." Top Stock Groups,

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: DON'T EXPECT ANOTHER YEAR OF BIG BOND GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, Wiles, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, specializes 
in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The investment forecasts are out for 1994, and many have a familiar ring: 
Bonds and bond mutual funds are likely to just "earn their coupons" over the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 What this literally means is that investors will continue to collect the 
promised interest, or coupon, payments on their bonds. Except for the small 
fraction of bonds that go into default, investors routinely collect these 
payments, so it is no big deal to earn the coupon. 
</P>
<P>
 What the phrase really means is that investors can't expect to reap more 
capital gains from dropping interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past dozen years, bond prices have appreciated as interest rates have 
fallen, padding the return for investors. But with rates now at much lower 
levels, bond fund investors can't presume that the capital gains tail wind will 
keep blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many bond fund managers concede that the riskiness of the bond market 
is rising, especially in view of the strengthening economy, which could add to 
inflationary pressures and thus put upward pressure on interest rates. As rates 
rise, the market value of existing fixed-rate bonds falls -- producing capital 
losses for bond owners rather than capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't necessarily mean you should abandon your bond fund holdings. 
These investments can add price stability to a stock portfolio. And unless 
interest rates rise sharply, the total return on intermediate- and long-term 
bonds -- their yield plus or minus any appreciation or depreciation in 
principal value -- probably will still beat the 2% to 3.5% yields available on 
Treasury bills, money market funds, certificates of deposit and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 But it does mean that an era of lower results on bond portfolios is around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, bond funds have averaged nearly 11% a year, including 
both interest income and capital gains and after expenses were taken out. 
</P>
<P>
 To put that into perspective, 11% is slightly better than the stock market's 
long-term performance and about twice as good as what bond investments have 
generated over most of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a danger that novice bond fund holders have grown complacent about the 
return potential on these products without understanding all the risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done a lot of consumer testing, and we've found that people don't 
understand the difference between total return and yield, and many think bond 
funds are insured by the FDIC," says Debra McGinty-Poteet, senior vice 
president and managing director of Bank of America's mutual fund division in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond funds, she notes, have been the preferred choice of bank customers driven 
out of savings accounts by the yield crunch. Yet stock investments, not bonds, 
are where people should park their long-term money for capital appreciation, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of further interest rate declines, the most promising area of 
the bond market heading into 1994 appears to be the municipal sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for tax-free bonds has intensified in the wake of higher personal 
tax rates under President Clinton. Yet supplies also surged to record levels in 
1992 and 1993, as cities, counties and state governments and their agencies 
rushed to refinance debt at attractive levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Munis didn't appreciate as much as other types of bonds -- namely 
Treasuries, to which they are often compared. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, municipals are even more attractive now relative to U.S. 
Treasury bonds than before the tax legislation was approved" in August, says 
Robert Dennis, manager of the Boston-based MFS Municipal Bond Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Munis represent "a classic investment opportunity" in the view of Sandy 
Lincoln, chief investment officer of Kemper Mutual Funds in Chicago. While 
demand is expected to remain heavy in 1994, the supply of new bonds could dry 
up considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 For fixed-income investors willing to venture into more aggressive areas, two 
good choices could be funds that hold lower-rated junk domestic bonds and 
European debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Junk bond funds have had three straight years of double-digit returns. They've 
been sparked by a sharp drop in the supply of newly issued bonds and by an 
improving economy and lower borrowing costs -- which have lessened default 
dangers. Even if investors only earn the coupon, they will be looking at 
returns of about 9% for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds with a large European bond exposure could do well if interest rates in 
those countries continue to drop. Les Nanberg, a senior vice president at MFS, 
believes European markets offer the best bond opportunities for 1994, as 
economic growth in Europe remains weak and interest rates stand at higher 
levels than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, 
has unveiled a brochure to alert savers that mutual funds don't carry federal 
deposit insurance -- even when sold by banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The free pamphlet, "Deposits & Investments: There's a Critical Difference," 
provides basic information on mutual funds and annuities, both of which are 
marketed at banks. It also offers tips for first-time investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The office has mailed brochures to all national banks. Investors can receive a 
copy by writing to the Consumer Information Center, P.O. Box 100, Pueblo, CO 
81002. 
</P>
<P>
 Bargain hunters would be unlikely to find a more depressed category heading 
into 1994 than the environmental funds. 
</P>
<P>
 These portfolios invest in companies that either clean up pollution or 
minimize it at the source. The funds have lagged the market for four straight 
years. A recent issue of the Value Line Investment Survey ranked environmental 
stocks No. 93 in timeliness of 97 industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
 It might still be early to buy these funds, but 1993's sharp rally in gold 
stocks showed that no sector remains prostrate forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity ((800) 544-8888), Invesco ((800) 525-8085), Kemper ((800) 621-1048) 
and Oppenheimer ((800) 525-7048) are among the fund families with larger 
environmental portfolios. Bond Performance in Perspective 
</P>
<P>
 Bond mutual funds had another good year in 1993 and have returned almost 11% 
annually on average over the past decade. But with interest rates lower today, 
such good performance may be difficult to match in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, bond investments have returned closer to 5% a year. This chart 
shows average annual results for major asset classes from 1926 through 1992. 
02,38,23 Investment Category Average Yearly Return Small stocks +12.2% Large 
stocks (Standard & Poor's 500) +10.3% Long-term bonds (U.S. governments) +4.8%

PUBLISHERS PROMISE PASSION BY THE PAGE; READING: THE NEW YEAR WILL BRING MORE 
SOUL-SEARCHING, NEW TALES ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS -- AND A BLESSED ABSENCE OF DIET 
BOOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stories where love truly triumphs . . . family sagas that actually make you 
want to read to the end . . . spiritual odysseys that are more than lite 
literature . . . fiction that grapples with tough and tender issues, like how 
three women rally around a fourth who is dying of breast cancer . . . a search, 
via the printed page, for a place called home. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers, take heart. The new year in books is upon us -- and it promises to be 
a time of renewed passion for the soul and rekindled joy in relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 In a variety of literary guises, values will be reassessed and reclaimed. 
Intellectual enlightenment will be possible for the ordinary mortal in the form 
of serious books that inform, without talking down. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps reflecting the Clintons' attempt to revise our health care system, 
books about all aspects of health are in vogue in this new literary year. But 
diet books are out. "Totally dead," said Barb Burg of Bantam Books in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1994 will also bring a raft of romantic fiction -- which publishers 
regard as a notch above romance novels -- publishing seems to have offered 
tacit approval to the fantasy of holing up with a mushy book and a bowl of 
bonbons. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, a small, sugary novel called "The Bridges of Madison County" made the 
Midwest sound downright sexy -- and in the process became a gigantic 
bestseller. The influence of Robert James Waller's fictional foray into the 
heartland will continue, said his publisher, Laurence J. Kirshbaum, who 
predicted that "what you will see is bringing books back to Iowa." 
</P>
<P>
 Many fiction writers who have inhabited the world of glitz "are looking to go 
back home," said Kirshbaum, president and chief executive officer of Warner 
Books in New York. "Demographers have always told us that everyone migrated 
from Iowa to California, and now they are migrating back." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Garwood's "Prince Charming," for example, a 1994 Pocket Books hardcover 
title, takes the standard romance recipe of a beautiful young Englishwoman who 
has been dumped by her heartless cad of a fiance -- and moves her to Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 But readers of fiction will also be exploring their diverse ethnic origins in 
1994. Again, it is the wild success of one such multi-generational saga -- Amy 
Tan's "The Joy Luck Club," published by Putnam's in 1989 -- that has sent 
publishers, and the public, scrambling for stories of ancestral struggle. "Rise 
the Euphrates," by Carol Edgarian, is frankly described by its publisher, 
Random House, as " 'The Joy Luck Club' for Armenians." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Dijkstra, the Del Mar-based literary agent who represents Tan, 
attributed the growing interest in multicultural fiction to a dual search for 
roots and gripping stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want stories," said Dijkstra, referring to her stable of hyphenated 
American authors, "and these writers are more in tune with stories" of their 
heritages. 
</P>
<P>
 Often epic in scope -- not to mention length -- these heroic accounts 
frequently become fodder for book clubs and reading groups, another exploding 
literary phenomenon in 1994. Brian Baxter, proprietor of Baxter's Books in 
Minneapolis, said literary gatherings are burgeoning in businesses, 
neighborhoods and churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're seeing people using books as a way to create relationships that we 
haven't had over the last two or three decades," Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an artificial society that they are creating, a community," he said. 
"They share the experience of a book -- and also of their own lives." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Baxter said such reading groups help fuel the demand for "very good 
fiction," Dijkstra, for one, worries that this is an endangered category. An 
onslaught of commercialism has produced "a real crisis in fiction right now," 
Dijkstra said. The novel of manners, as one example, is virtually extinct, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, she added, mainstream fiction targeted at women apparently is not 
selling as well as it once did. 
</P>
<P>
 At Random House, however, there are high hopes that "Talk Before Sleep," by 
Elizabeth Berg, will prove to be an exception. The story probes the frank 
intimacy and the fierce loyalty that mark women's friendships in the 1990s -- 
and shows how both are put to the test when one friend develops breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But a male writer who attempted a similar level of emotional candor might run 
into problems, Dijkstra said. Men in 1994, she maintained, "are in deep trouble 
in terms of fiction. What publishers want from men is thrillers -- and it's a 
tough world for a male writer if he's not Clancy, Koontz, Crichton or Grisham." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But men are not the only ones reading thriller books. Kirshbaum, at Warner 
Books, said a noticeable trend for the new year is "the muscularization of the 
novel in terms of female tastes." Partly as an educational effort -- a genuine 
attempt by women to understand the male portion of the planet, Kirshbaum said 
-- "women are reading more of these books. They are crossing over more into an 
area we used to think of as 'men's fiction.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Female readers are also showing a steady appetite for tough types of 
nonfiction. Dijkstra described two recent books she had sold -- "Why Good Girls 
Don't Get Ahead" and "The Book of the Woman Warrior" -- as "very, very 
aggressive" books. She predicted that the fierce tenor of the gender wars in 
books "is going to go on until the end of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 But people cannot live on conflict alone. Fortunately, said Lisa Johnson of 
E.P. Dutton in New York, there's sex to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're talking about trends for 1994, you're definitely talking about 
sex," Johnson said. A February title from Dutton, "Hot Monogamy" by someone 
whose actual name is Dr. Patricia Love (and a co-writer, with the less 
evocative name of Joe Robinson), should burn its way through the densest of 
brown paper wrappings. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Dutton will bring out Lonnie Barbach's "The Erotic Edge," a collection 
of lusty stories for couples. Soon thereafter, Dutton is publishing Eva 
Margolies' "Undressing the American Male," to be followed by "The Faux Gourmet: 
A Single Woman's Confessions on Food and Sex," by Juli Huss. 
</P>
<P>
 At just about the same time from Random House, there is "A Natural History of 
Love," by Diane Ackerman -- including a section of "sexual chic," or 
"perversion as fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Although sex is obviously nothing new, what distinguishes these books, Johnson 
said, is a "very '90s" focus on commitment. "These are sex books for nice, 
normal yuppies," she said. "What they're saying is you can stay with someone 
and still have passion." 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1994, passion pledges to have a variety of implications. Baxter, a 
longtime observer of the book business, said he is particularly impressed with 
the intensity -- passion, if you will -- that top executives are bringing to 
the search for books for their work forces. Some companies even set aside 
on-the-job reading time, Baxter said. Often, the recommended titles focus on 
psychology or on family issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're recognizing that books are one way to address the health and 
well-being of their employees," Baxter said. "You're seeing the work/family 
equation make its way into the bookstore." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Books about business will also have a new slant. Greed, for one thing, will 
not be venerated with quite the same wide-eyed adulation it has enjoyed for the 
last decade or so. Instead, books such as Hyrum W. Smith's "The 10 Natural Laws 
of Successful Time and Life Management" (Warner Books) will seek to combine 
personal growth and professional prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 And rather than blindly extolling the virtues of the American Dream, "The 
Force: A Year in the Life of a Sales Team" (Random House), by David Dorsey, 
will offer "an utterly convincing fly-on-the-wall account of how the American 
Dream manipulates the lives of seven men and women." 
</P>
<P>
 It may sound sappy to say it, conceded Ellen Herrick of Warner Books, but "I 
think it's a real serious trend, this whole values thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The new spin to values in books is that "people are not just talking about 
doing good, but being good," Herrick said. "I think people are desperately 
casting about for new directions." 
</P>
<P>
 Counterbalancing this sense of altruism, however, is an apparently unbridled 
appetite for celebrity books -- or what Kirshbaum calls "the book as National 
Enquirer special." 
</P>
<P>
 More reflectively, Harold Evans, the publisher of Random House, observed that 
in 1994, "the translation of the popular culture in the sense that it is 
represented by Rush Limbaugh or Howard Stern" will be sought by ever-growing 
numbers of readers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am always surprised by the quantities of people who want to read these 
books," Evans said. "There is something being said about American culture by 
these types of people that I myself can't fully fathom." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps, Evans said, 1994 will bring a reaction against "this vulgarity, 
this very, very narcissistic sort of publishing." 
</P>
<P>
 But conceding that he was feeling especially optimistic, Evans said: "I think 
that the common thread this year is books with a great deal of sympathy for 
mankind's predicament in them."

 There are lots of dry subjects, but water isn't one of them. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * If all Earth's water fit in a gallon jug, available fresh water would equal 
just more than a tablespoon -- less than half of 1% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earth has virtually the same amount of water today as it did when dinosaurs 
roamed the planet, but only 3% of the water is fresh -- and two-thirds of that 
is ice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some 4 trillion gallons of precipitation fall on the United States every 
day, but much of that disappears in evaporation and runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 * To produce a gallon of milk, a dairy cow must drink four gallons of water. 
But it takes double that amount of water to grow a single tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 * A healthy person can live for a month without food but will die in less than 
a week without fresh water. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States uses more water to produce electricity than for any other 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 * The typical U.S. household uses about 100 gallons of water per person per 
day, while two-thirds of the people in the world use less than 13 gallons each. 
</P>
<P>
 * Southern Californians are the nation's biggest users -- with the bulk of the 
water soaked up by irrigated fields.

COMPUTERS REDEFINING PUBLISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's "deadly dull and serious," conceded Harold Evans, the publisher of Random 
House, but in 1994, publishers will be "putting on our electronic skates." 
</P>
<P>
 What this means, for an industry devoted to words written on paper, is 
learning to love the CD-ROM. It means making peace with the possibility of 
"books" the size of a credit card. It means contracts that tell writers -- 
notoriously an obstreperous lot -- to submit their manuscripts on computer 
disks. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiouser and curiouser, say those who had secretly hoped the information 
superhighway might bypass their neighborhood. "It's a bit as if we suddenly had 
to catch up with the nuclear age," said John Sterling, editor in chief of 
Houghton Mifflin in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic reckoning raises the question of precisely what a writer 
creates. Once created, who owns "the work," as most contracts refer to any 
literary endeavor? How do writers and their publishers divvy up the rights to 
future technological adaptations? Who bears the cost of producing electronic 
editions? How are they safeguarded? 
</P>
<P>
 "All kinds of notions about what publishing is or is not are beginning to 
break down," Sterling said. "There's a real sense that the business just can't 
continue in its present mode. The old and familiar ways of doing business are 
just not good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 One great concern is that electronic wizardry will somehow make reading 
obsolete. Curling up with a hand-held computer is just not the same as flipping 
the pages of a beloved book. 
</P>
<P>
 But Evans said the unscientific research he has done in his living room 
suggests otherwise. His two young children, Evans said, spend hours with the 
animated-for-computer children's "books" that Random House has developed with 
Broderbund, a German publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 "My experience is that the kids, having played with the Berenstain Bears, want 
to go back to the book," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the factions within publishing that are not expressing terror at 
the electronic incursion are voicing hope that technological innovations will 
jolt the industry out of what many see as its current complacency. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have this frustration with, and despair about, the traditional 
publishing business," Sterling said. "There's a real concern that the way 
publishing has worked in the past is just not working anymore. And there's a 
hope that electronic publishing is going to be a panacea." 
</P>
<P>
 But so much of the electronic buzz continues to remain incomprehensible, even 
to those spreading it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wonderful thing is, you can say almost anything, and nobody knows if 
you're wrong," Evans said. ELIZABETH MEHREN

 English Channel Tunnel Fare Set: Motorists traveling through the tunnel 
between England and France may need something more than a sense of adventure. A 
fat wallet, for instance.The Sunday Times reported that the round-trip fare for 
taking a car through the tunnel will be about $240. From May to June and 
October to December a standard round-trip ticket will sell for about $240 per 
car, rising to $330 to $360 during the busiest tourist season, the newspaper 
said. The fares for the 31-mile Channel tunnel, nicknamed the Chunnel, would be 
slightly more expensive than those for much slower ferries, but low enough to 
plunge ferry operators into a fare price war, the newspaper reported. Passenger 
service will begin in May.

 Ex-IMF Secretary-General Dies: Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, a former head of the 
International Monetary Fund and top official in French economic policy, died 
Sunday, his family said.He was 81. The cause and place of death were not 
disclosed. A member of the French Resistance, Schweitzer survived a Nazi 
concentration camp and went on to a brilliant career in French and 
international finance after World War II. Through the 1950s and early '60s, 
Schweitzer served as the second vice governor of the Bank of France. In 1963 he 
began a 10-year stewardship of the IMF as secretary general. His father's 
brother, Dr. Albert Schweitzer, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952.

 Analyst review: "Downey Savings & Loan is performing well in spite of a slow 
economy, and has comparatively few non-performing loans at a time when other 
California institutions are having problems. It is now operating on a fully 
taxed basis, having lost the tax benefits it received from the 1988 acquisition 
of Butterfield Savings, so more is going out in taxes. It needs to concentrate 
on growing its assets, since it has too much equity and too much capital. Its 
CEO, Robert Kemper, recently announced retirement plans, and until a 
replacement is named, it is essentially a company in a holding pattern. 
Afterwards, however, I expect that it will embark on an aggressive growth 
strategy."

Corporate outlook: "The 1993 year was a good one for Downey and we look forward 
to the challenges of 1994. Clearly, the new year will be influenced by the 
direction of the California economy. However, we believe we have the controls 
and strategies in place to minimize any adverse effect the economy might 
otherwise bring."
