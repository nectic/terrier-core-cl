BRANCH TO SEEK REELECTION, HIS ATTORNEY SAYS; GOVERNMENT: THE COUNTY RECORDER, 
WHO HAS BEEN URGED TO RESIGN, INTENDS TO CONTINUE HIS CAREER, LLOYD A. CHARTON 
SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County Recorder Lee A. Branch, who has been urged by county officials 
to resign because of sexual harassment and physical abuse allegations, is 
expected to announce his candidacy for reelection next week, his attorney said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Lloyd A. Charton said his client has been searching for a campaign 
manager and expects to hold a fund-raiser next month in an attempt to win a 
fifth, four-year term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's gearing up the campaign," Charton said. "I think the (County Board of 
Supervisors) ought to stop interfering with his ability to do his job in an 
unfettered manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Branch, 57, who has held the office since 1978, has been reelected handily 
each term despite harsh public criticisms of office operations. He could not be 
reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Charton said Branch is intent on continuing his career in the office, a 
massive repository for the filing of documents largely dealing with real estate 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since late October, Branch has been the subject of a county investigation into 
claims by employees that his relationship with an administrator in the office, 
Nancy L. Smith, had caused serious morale and operational problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have also looked into claims that Branch had made lewd remarks 
to a female employee and that he had physically abused another worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch has acknowledged a relationship with Smith, but has denied any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who is on leave from her position as documents manager in the office, 
has also been accused of physically abusing an employee. She has denied any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have confirmed that she is expected to be recommended for 
transfer from the recorder's office to another county position. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, county officials have privately urged Branch to resign. And 
earlier this week, Supervisor Thomas F. Riley joined that call, saying that 
Branch's resignation would be "in the best interest of himself and his family." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I don't even know him," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the County Board of Supervisors has no authority to dismiss Branch, 
because he is an elected official. Short of a loss at the polls, the most 
serious punishment the county could level against the recorder is a censure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charton said the allegations against his client have no merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has done nothing wrong," Charton said. "We have considered these claims by 
employees and there is nothing there."

WANTED MAN STROLLS INTO SHERIFF'S OFFICE, CLAIMING AMNESIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Robert Joseph Moody walked up to a reception desk at the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department claiming to suffer from amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
 If Moody didn't know who he was, he quickly found out. He's a TV celebrity of 
sorts, a murder suspect featured in December on "America's Most Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Moody appeared Wednesday morning at a personnel office on the first floor of 
the Sheriff's headquarters in Santa Ana, saying he was "confused as to his 
identity," a sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A fingerprint search promptly identified him as the 34-year-old Tucson 
resident suspected of killing two women in separate incidents in November. He's 
being held without bail in the Orange County Jail. In several days or weeks, he 
may be extradited to Arizona to face murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest ended a manhunt of almost two months that spanned three states. The 
first killing occurred Nov. 15 when an acquaintance of Moody's, 33-year-old 
Michelle Page Malone, was found shot to death in her Tucson home. The second 
victim, 56-year-old Patricia Magda, a neighbor of Moody's, was found beaten to 
death in her Tucson home about a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 Moody stole Magda's car, which was later recovered at the home of Moody's 
former sister-in-law in Yuma, authorities said. Moody then allegedly tied up 
his former relatives Dec. 20 and stole their car, a gun and cash, said Sgt. 
Michael Downing, homicide supervisor for the Pima County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us that he said he was going to Mexico," Pima Detective Mike Ying 
said. "We knew we'd arrest him eventually, but I never thought it would happen 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 By tracing credit card receipts and following tips from viewers of "America's 
Most Wanted," police traced Moody's path, Downing said. He went from Yuma to 
Las Vegas to San Diego to Los Angeles, and back to Yuma and Las Vegas. 
Sheriff's deputies missed him in each city by a small margin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police came closer Jan. 4, when Los Angeles County sheriff's officers stopped 
the stolen car in a routine traffic stop in Lennox. The driver told deputies 
that Moody had loaned him the car, Downing said.  
</P>
<P>
 The driver also said Moody had bragged that he had been the subject of a 
segment of "America's Most Wanted," but the driver said he had dismissed 
Moody's story as bravado. 
</P>
<P>
 At the sheriff's station in Santa Ana, a spokesman said, Moody told 
investigators "he didn't know anything about himself before (Tuesday). He said, 
'You call me Moody, but I don't know anything about that name.' " 
</P>
<P>
 An Arizona sheriff's deputy said Moody was a former financial analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 His capture brought relief to Magda's family in Tucson, who had been living in 
fear since the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really glad he's not going to have the opportunity to do this to anyone 
else," said Nancy Royle, the victim's daughter-in-law.  
</P>
<P>
 Royle said she believes her mother-in-law, who had three children and five 
grandchildren, was killed for her car Nov. 24. The woman's assailant also stole 
her wallet, bank card and some money. Royle and her husband found Magda's body 
after she had failed to arrive at a Thanksgiving gathering at a relative's home 
in Utah.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's sickening," Royle said. "It's a terrible, terrible thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Royle said Magda, who worked at a title company, was a "charitable, giving, 
caring, wonderful person" who would help anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Her caring even extended to Moody, her neighbor. Although Magda did not know 
Moody well, she would listen with sympathy to his complaints about financial 
problems and about his daughter living out of state, Royle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very kind about speaking to him," Royle said. "At one point she 
brought him over some food because she knew he was hungry. She had even 
mentioned to a friend at work that she felt bad for him."

IRVINE STAFF THROWS A WRENCH IN EL TORO BOARD PLAN; COMMITMENT IN WRITING 
REQUESTED ON ANNEXATION; WIEDER SAYS CITY IS 'GETTING A LITTLE TOO HOGGISH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The plan touted as the best possible compromise in the political fight over 
the future of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station was thrown into question 
Friday when Irvine officials demanded that the Board of Supervisors put in 
writing the promises they say were made to the city during secret negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 An Irvine city staff report released Friday listed a host of written 
commitments the city is demanding from the county, including a "commitment to 
allow the annexation of (the base by Irvine) prior to January, 1999." 
</P>
<P>
 But given the county's reluctance so far to formally commit to that and other 
points -- verbally promising only "discussions" about a possible annexation by 
Irvine -- it was unclear late Friday whether the latest development was a deal 
breaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Councilman Barry J. Hammond, who helped negotiate the agreement, 
said the city has lost millions of dollars in potential tax revenue from being 
on the losing end of previous annexation disputes with the county, and is 
determined to not lose its battle to incorporate the 4,700-acre base within its 
city limits when the Marines move out sometime before 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get resolution on how we are going to move ahead" with annexation, 
Hammond said. "If we cannot get that, that's a deal breaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Mayor Michael Ward, however, took a less threatening stand, saying the 
city simply wants what he contends the county's negotiators already agreed to 
verbally: "Seriously talk to us to get annexation by a certain date." 
</P>
<P>
 The language in the staff report released Friday "may be toned down by the 
time it gets to the council" for a vote on Irvine's next move scheduled for 
Tuesday, Ward added. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner, one of the county's key negotiators, took time 
to study the Irvine staff report Friday, but declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, however, said she was "disheartened" that 
Irvine was pressing the annexation issue. Even though Irvine's message was sent 
out through a staff report, she said it would not have been written without the 
approval of the council leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are really causing the plan to go down the tubes. They are getting a 
little too hoggish," Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Working to hold the deal together, County Administrative Officer Ernie 
Schneider and Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. met late Friday afternoon 
and agreed to try to "clarify" the annexation issue before the council meets 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am prepared to recommend to the Board of Supervisors that we enter into the 
discussions on the process of annexation. Not that we are agreeing to 
annexation, but that we would enter into the discussions, as we would with any 
other jurisdiction," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine council members had been expected to formally endorse the compromise 
agreement Tuesday, and Schneider said he hoped that would still occur. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the city staff report released Friday, council members were being urged 
to send a letter to the supervisors asking for a written confirmation of their 
deal by Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiating points should be in writing, "so that future supervisors 
follow the procedure," Ward said. At least two of the five supervisors are 
expected to leave the board after the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 The annexation issue "is very important to us," Hammond said in a separate 
interview. "We want to make sure that we, as a city, are the ultimate decision 
maker and have the ultimate control over the areas that are in our sphere of 
influence and that are ultimately going to be in our city limits." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors purposely omitted the annexation issue from their motion last 
month when they approved formation of an El Toro planning board comprised of 
the five supervisors, three representatives from Irvine and one from Lake 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said after the board vote that they would not commit outright 
to Irvine's annexation of the base and other nearby land. 
</P>
<P>
 Having watched the county's tax base erode in recent years, primarily due to 
the formation of new South County cities, officials said the county will not 
give away the land without negotiating a share of the tax revenue expected to 
come from the land's redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said after his meeting with the Irvine city manager that the county 
cannot agree to annexation until after the base conversion plan is adopted. If 
the El Toro agency decides to turn the base into a commercial airport, then it 
has to remain under the county's control, and Irvine cannot annex the property, 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of a $300-million bond issue for the John Wayne Airport expansion 
required that if another airport was developed in Orange County, its operations 
could not compete with John Wayne, and the county would have to operate both 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider also said the county would negotiate a possible annexation agreement 
with Irvine if the city agrees to "put all tax revenues on the table," 
including property, sales and hotel occupancy taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed draft of the letter to be considered by the Irvine council states 
that the city's agreement to join the El Toro agency "was predicated upon 
confirmation by the (supervisors) on several important points which were not 
entirely identified as part of the (supervisors') action." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to seeking permission to annex the base, Irvine says it received 
the county's commitment on other key points, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * A provision that the El Toro board would adopt "impact criteria," so that 
any redevelopment plan cannot be approved unless it meets certain requirements 
designed to mitigate the impact on surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
 * The formation of a legally binding, three-tier "joint powers authority," 
consisting of a board of directors, an executive council made up of all 31 
Orange County cities, several South County communities in unincorporated areas, 
business groups and up to 10 advisory committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county had assumed that Supervisor Thomas F. Riley would serve as 
the agency chairman and Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez would be vice chairman, 
Irvine officials said both positions should "be shared" among the county, 
Irvine and Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine also wants the base conversion plan to be comprehensive, so that the 
necessary planning, zoning and environmental studies for the site are ready for 
approval by the county and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiated agreement "represents the final position of the city of 
Irvine," according to the staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 If an impasse develops, it could reopen once again the contentious debate that 
has raged for six months over which government agencies will plan the future 
use of El Toro, possibly to the benefit of the North County cities that have 
been denied seats on the governing board under the latest plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton warned recently that if the agreement with Irvine 
fell apart, the county would consider forming an 11-member planning board made 
up of the five supervisors, a city representative from each of the five 
supervisorial districts, and an 11th member chosen by the other 10 members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lake Forest City Council, which did not participate in the negotiations 
that led to the agreement, has refused to officially join the agency until it 
receives documents detailing the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 While several other cities have sought seats on the decision-making board, 
there is universal agreement that the county and Irvine are the two agencies 
that must be included if the plan is to win Defense Department approval, since 
they share land-use authority over the site.

A SAD CODA TO A SHORT LIFE; JUST BEFORE HIS DEATH,TEEN WROTE OF HIS HOPE TO END 
VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Just three weeks ago, 17-year-old Siriaco Gonzalez issued a written plea for 
an end to the gang violence that has been an everyday part of the neighborhood 
where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 In an essay that he completed for his Saddleback High School Family Studies 
class before Christmas vacation, Siriaco wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the greatest goals I want to achieve, not just in my life but in 
everybody's life, is to stop gang violence and increase the peace. Too many 
innocent people pay the price for individuals fighting for pride." 
</P>
<P>
 No one read it until Siriaco was dead -- the victim of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Nancy O'Connor sat down to read her student's essay the day after she 
learned that he had become Orange County's first 1994 homicide victim. The 
veteran educator said she was struck deeply by what Siriaco had written. 
</P>
<P>
 "This young man was more than just another teen homicide," O'Connor said 
Friday. "His dreams and goals were so ambitious and so full of hope. He was a 
young man with potential and a dream that is now gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Siriaco was gunned down near a stretch of Santa Fe railroad tracks on his way 
to school early Tuesday in a slaying that police suspect was gang-related. 
Siriaco was not a known hard-core gang member but was carrying a handgun when 
he was killed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a territory where there is a hard-core gang, and there may have 
been some kind of confrontation," Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said 
Friday. "He may have been at the wrong place at the wrong time." Police have no 
suspects in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Siriaco was buried Friday at Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Orange after a funeral 
service at St. Anne's Church attended by 500 people. The boy's mother, Vitalina 
Gonzalez, requested that her son's essay be read at his rosary service Thursday 
night as a message to teen-agers to give up gang life. 
</P>
<P>
 Siriaco, who for a time played soccer and ran track at Saddleback High, was a 
known graffiti tagger who had begun hanging with the wrong crowd for at least 
nine months before his death, according to police and those who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was different," said his brother, Jose, 24. "He wasn't involved in sports 
at school this year and he was behind in credits. But he said he never had any 
problems with anyone. Everyone in the neighborhood who knew him liked him." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Siriaco, who was enrolled in Saddleback High School's 
Independent Studies program, still hoped to graduate with his classmates in 
June, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of his teachers felt that he was trying to break away from the wrong 
crowd," O'Connor said. "He had a determination to graduate. He was taking 
independent studies for extra credits in addition to a full load of classes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the essay, which O'Connor gave to the boy's family the day after his death, 
Siriaco writes of his dream to receive his high school diploma: 
</P>
<P>
 "In June of 1994, if everything goes as expected, I will be walking up that 
aisle in the middle of the auditorium to shake our administrator's hand and 
receiving my high school diploma." 
</P>
<P>
 Siriaco also hoped to attend Rancho Santiago College and eventually own an 
auto repair business, and he wrote of getting married and having children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents were very sad when they read the essay," Jose Gonzalez said as he 
stood outside the family's home after the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were upset to know what his goals were and to know that he was not going 
to have a future. What made them most upset was what he wrote at the end about 
gangs and that he was the one to be killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Gonzalez said his family is still mystified by the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say he had a gun," he said. "We never knew he had a gun. Still, he 
wasn't the kind of guy who could shoot anybody, who could do what was done to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor, an educator in the Santa Ana Unified School District since 1964, 
said she had sensed that her student was caught between two worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an identified gifted student in junior high school," she said. "He 
expressed himself very well, was very prompt with his work and did a very good 
job. How could this happen to somebody with those dreams and goals? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the frustration, wondering what went wrong."

MARTINEZ REINSTATED AS CITY CLERK; POLITICS: OFFICIAL FIRED AFTER SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS WINS HIS JOB BACK WHEN COUNCIL DECIDES NOT TO PURSUE THE 
CASE. HE HAS FILED A CLAIM FOR $125,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Elias (Lee) Martinez, who was fired as city clerk in June, won his job back 
Friday when the City Council chose not to intervene, ending a widely criticized 
sexual harassment investigation that has been mired in the city bureaucracy for 
more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Martinez will return to his old office Monday morning with the sexual 
harassment charges against him formally dropped, several issues raised by the 
case will take longer to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials plan to review the allegations again to determine what went 
awry in the investigation and others have called for more clear-cut sexual 
harassment standards in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, meanwhile, has filed a claim against the city seeking more than 
$125,000 in back pay and attorney fees as well as other unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returns to work next week, Martinez said, he plans to call a staff 
meeting and pledge to the workers that he has no interest in retaliation 
against those who complained about him. He said he also intends to be more 
businesslike and less friendly in the office so he does not offend any workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't deny that I might have complimented a woman on her appearance," he 
said. "I compliment men too. But those statements were being taken out of 
context and used against me." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting City Clerk Nancy Russell, who was appointed to Martinez's position when 
he left, said the staff has discussed Martinez's return and will handle it 
professionally. Some of those who lodged the allegations said they intend to do 
their jobs and not let the past controversy interfere. 
</P>
<P>
 "My conscience is clear. I told the truth," said one woman. "If no one 
believes us, what can we do? If I see him, I won't say a thing. What's there to 
say?" 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, 55, rose from garage attendant to one of the city's highest posts 
only to see his 32-year city career abruptly terminated in June when the 
council fired him for creating a sexually charged atmosphere in the office. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began in October, 1991, when a clerk typist accused Martinez of 
rubbing her thigh while the two were alone at a restaurant and inappropriately 
touching her on two other occasions during the workday. As that case was being 
reviewed, other women in the office accused Martinez of ogling them and making 
inappropriate remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman said Martinez had stared at her breasts while he complimented the 
buttons on her blouse. Another said he asked her repeatedly if she knew how to 
whistle. A third said that Martinez called her on the telephone from across the 
office, complimented her dress and said he was looking at her. 
</P>
<P>
 After investigating, the city's Personnel Department transferred the main 
accuser to another city job and counseled Martinez on sexual harassment 
standards. The case appeared to be over. 
</P>
<P>
 But, unaware that anybody had talked to Martinez about the charges, the main 
accuser wrote an angry letter to Council President John Ferraro alleging a 
cover-up. Ferraro turned the letter over to then-Mayor Tom Bradley, who revived 
the investigation and eventually recommended that Martinez be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The council upheld that decision, after what officials described as agonizing 
closed-door debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the ordeal, Martinez maintained that a political dispute with 
Bradley prompted his termination. He appealed the June dismissal and last fall 
a city hearing examiner and the city's Civil Service Commission found no 
evidence of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing examiner, Nancy Roberts Lonsdale, said she found inconsistencies 
in the allegations by the women and doubted their accounts. The main accuser 
had been drinking during the alleged incidents and shortly before she reported 
them to superiors, Lonsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the commissioners agreed with Lonsdale and said Martinez had been 
railroaded. They criticized the city attorney's office for overzealously 
pursuing the case and ordered that he be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the council voted 8 to 7 not to review the commission's decision, 
marking the final chapter in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, concerned about the city's bungling of the case 
and the message it sends to women who have been harassed, said she will 
investigate the entire matter in the council's Personnel Committee in the 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will definitely have a chilling effect on other women coming forward," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joe Gelman, chairman of the Civil Service Commission, said the case smacks 
of "sexual McCarthyism" to him. The city has to put out clearer sexual 
harassment guidelines to prevent false harassment claims in the future, he 
said.

 "We have to make it clear that sexual harassment will not be tolerated but we 
have to define more clearly what sexual harassment is," he said. "Left unclear, 
everything can be sexual harassment. I would like to discourage false, 
exaggerated claims that can put someone like Lee Martinez through hell."

FBI PAPERS SHOW NOLAN WAS AN INFORMANT IN 1980S; ETHICS: INDICTED ASSEMBLYMAN 
SAID WILLIE BROWN WAS MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM. THE SPEAKER HAS DENIED ALL 
ALLEGATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Republican Assemblyman Pat Nolan, now under indictment on political corruption 
charges, acted as an FBI informant in the mid-1980s, providing agents with 
allegations that Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown manipulated the 
system to raise campaign money, according to documents obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In six conversations in 1985 and 1986, Nolan told FBI agents how the Speaker 
-- who was his political rival -- could swing the outcome of an issue by 
influencing the actions of nine or 10 Assembly Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan described the legislators, at least half of whom are still in the 
Legislature or other elective offices, as having "total disregard concerning 
the merits of (a) bill" adding that "their primary motivation is 'milking' 
campaign contributions" from lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 At their initial meeting at his Glendale office in October, 1985, Nolan, then 
the Assembly Republican leader, told the agents he was "willing to fully 
cooperate with the FBI and testify at trial if necessary," according to 11 
pages of confidential FBI notes of the conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan backfired for Nolan, who was then seeking to unseat Brown as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan, 43, is awaiting trial in March on corruption charges. Brown, who 
remains Speaker, has never been charged with a crime in connection with the FBI 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a San Francisco legislator, could not be reached for comment, but he 
told the San Francisco Chronicle: "In my review of this document, there's 
clearly nothing true except the correct spelling of some of the names. Frankly, 
my reaction is I'm just sorry for Pat Nolan." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan declined to comment. But in a statement released Friday, Nolan's office 
said the veteran Glendale legislator's actions show he "was one of the few 
people who as long ago as 1985 was trying to assist the government's inquiry 
into questionable practices in the state Legislature. Frankly, that's why the 
government's effort against him came as such a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, a federal grand jury indicted Nolan and Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) 
on charges of using their public offices to solicit illegal payments. Nolan, 
charged with six counts of racketeering, extortion, conspiracy and money 
laundering, is accused of soliciting a series of bribes from unidentified 
individuals seeking his support on bills before the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments grew out of a sting operation in which FBI agents posed as 
Southern businessmen seeking legislation to establish a shrimp processing plant 
in West Sacramento. The sting operation was already under way -- although it 
was not publicly known -- when Nolan began talking to the FBI. Both Nolan and 
Hill have pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 In face-to-face meetings and on the telephone with agents, Nolan sketched a 
picture of legislators motivated by the need to raise large amounts of funds to 
win reelection and stay in power. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan told the FBI that Brown was the "the hub of the wheel" in state 
politics. He contended that Brown was "particularly interested with legislation 
concerning gambling, liquor and exemptions from the Coastal Commission." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Brown would instruct certain lobbyists to "solicit campaign 
contributions or a 'fee' (that would be) directed to Brown's law firm." 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, Brown essentially offered to "split the fee" with Nolan, who was 
seeking help for a constituent trying to build a pizza parlor, according to the 
FBI notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan also described three Los Angeles-area state senators, including former 
state Sen. Paul B. Carpenter (D-Downey), as having reputations for being 
involved in "bag bills" and bartering their votes for political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a federal jury in Sacramento convicted Carpenter on a variety of 
corruption charges, primarily based on testimony of former state Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Van Nuys), who earlier was also convicted on corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Another senator would "normally barter his vote" on special interest 
legislation, Nolan told the FBI, adding "it was rumored" that the legislator 
"has a room full of gifts he received as a result of supporting 'bag bills.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan told investigators he had been contacted by then-Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa 
Clarita), a former Los Angeles police chief, who told him "he was frustrated 
and disgusted with the political process." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan said Davis told him "if he had three of his bunco people up here, he 
would clean it up."

EPA BEGINS STEPS TO PENALIZE STATE OVER SMOG PLANS; POLLUTION: ACTION AGAINST 
CALIFORNIA COMES EVEN THOUGH STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS ARE CLOSE TO A 
COMPROMISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Friday started the process of withholding 
federal highway funds and imposing other strict economic sanctions on 
California, Illinois and Indiana for failing to overhaul their state Smog Check 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the action proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the 
federal government on June 15 could freeze more than $1.5 billion a year in 
highway funds allocated for the three states unless their lawmakers adopt bills 
that improve their policing of automobile tailpipe emissions. California stands 
to lose as much as $800 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among state officials in Sacramento, reaction was swift. Top officials in the 
Wilson Administration and some members of both parties in the Legislature 
attacked the EPA, saying the federal action was tantamount to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Nichols, the EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, told 
The Times that the Clinton Administration "has no choice" under the Clean Air 
Act than to take the action. The EPA gave California a two-month reprieve to 
fix its program in November, even though the Clean Air Act requires states to 
have more stringent car inspection programs in place by January, 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 Nichols stressed, however, that she is confident that such dire action will be 
averted in all three states.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is every reason to expect that we will never impose these sanctions," 
Nichols said. "All we're doing now is starting a time clock, which will result 
in sanctions next spring if we don't get a bill passed. But I emphasize that I 
think we will get one before then. I really want to emphasize how very 
preliminary this action is." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal action comes at a time when a team of California legislators, Gov. 
Pete Wilson's aides and EPA officials say they are close to agreeing on a 
compromise bill that will be sent to the Legislature. The compromise is 
designed to clean up the worst exhaust-belching cars without putting 
California's 9,000 Smog Check stations out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 California's massive Smog Check program -- mandated by federal law and 
administered by state government -- requires motorists to have their vehicles 
tested every two years and repaired if limits on smog-causing gases are 
exceeded.  
</P>
<P>
 For years, the program has been criticized as being plagued by fraud and for 
failing to identify and fix the worst polluting cars. Although all sides agree 
that it needs fixing, the conflict between the federal government and state 
officials centers on how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the debate focuses on whether the same service stations that 
administer the tests should be allowed to continue handling repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), a leading negotiator, said the EPA's move 
toward sanctions could anger so many state leaders that it will short-circuit 
the progress that has made. 
</P>
<P>
 "EPA is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory," Katz said. "I don't see 
why the EPA feels the need to prove it's the biggest kid on the block. . . . 
Particularly for people who don't like the compromise, it could be a convenient 
excuse to go to war on this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Strock, Wilson's secretary for environmental protection, called the 
proposed sanctions "inexplicable" and a "foolish action by the federal 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Strock said the Wilson Administration now will have to "take a second look" at 
the proposed compromise because it raises "a question of good faith and even 
competence" of EPA officials in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we are very close to an agreement; we expected it as early as 
Tuesday. But now, with no reason I can understand, they imposed sanctions that 
are not required by law but lie fully with the discretion of the (EPA) 
administration," Strock said.  
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, one has to wonder if there is any point to continuing the 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), who authored a bill revamping Smog 
Check and has been trying for months to get state leaders to agree, said "the 
EPA has been very patient and cooperative with California to this point." 
</P>
<P>
 "The (sanctions) process still allows plenty of time . . . to reach agreement 
on an acceptable proposal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), co-author of the Clean Air Act, endorsed 
the move toward sanctions, calling it "a wake-up call to Gov. Wilson and the 
California Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups also applauded the EPA's action.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's overdue and we're happy to see them do it. It's a sign that the EPA will 
obey the federal Clean Air Act," said Gladys Meade, a longtime clean air 
advocate with the American Lung Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA will hold a public hearing on the sanction proposal March 3 at the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power. The final action by the EPA on whether 
to impose the sanctions will come May 15, and the penalties could go into 
effect a month later, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
 California is the furthest behind of the three states in overhauling its auto 
inspection program. The Indiana and Illinois legislatures, Nichols said, must 
make minor technical and funding revisions, while California's Legislature 
still must agree on a complete overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA believes that California should replace the thousands of privately 
owned Smog Check stations with a network of centralized test-only centers 
overseen by the state and equipped with sophisticated equipment. Cars that fail 
the tests would have to be taken to independent mechanics for repairs. The EPA 
says separating the inspections from the repairs is the best way to minimize 
fraud and clean up more exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson and most legislators want to retain the 9,000 independent stations 
and enhance the program with random roadside inspections using a technology 
called remote sensing to catch the worst polluters. They say the EPA's approach 
of test-only centers would inconvenience motorists and be less successful in 
targeting the dirtiest cars.  
</P>
<P>
 In the proposed compromise, 30% of California cars would undergo enhanced 
testing at the centralized stations, increasing to 60% in 1996 unless the state 
can prove the program of random roadside testing works. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols said some details are still being debated but that the compromise 
looks good to the EPA.

AUDIT REVEALS MISSPENDING IN RIOT RECOVERY PROGRAM; BUSINESS: MANY RECIPIENTS 
EITHER SPENT GRANTS IMPROPERLY OR GOT DUPLICATE AID AND FAILED TO REIMBURSE THE 
CITY. BUT THE AGENCY'S DIRECTOR SAYS FLAWS HAVE BEEN FIXED. 
</P>

<P>
 More than half of the $2.6 million that a city agency gave businesses for 
repairs after the 1992 riots was either spent improperly or not repaid as 
promised, or may have duplicated payments made by private insurance and other 
government agencies, an audit has found. 
</P>
<P>
 A complete assessment of the Community Redevelopment Agency program has not 
been possible, since a review of the 95 businesses given grants is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case of one grant recipient that received $70,000 has already been 
referred to the city attorney's office for a possible fraud prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle reviewed the agency's internal audit and declared 
its efforts to correct problems "lousy." In a letter to the CRA, Tuttle said 
his office was so concerned that it might seek to take over financial oversight 
duties for the semi-independent city agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate CRA audit reviewed a private security company hired to patrol parts 
of Hollywood, finding that the firm failed to provide the level of patrols 
promised and then overbilled the city $24,769. Tuttle again criticized the 
agency for not holding its employees accountable for failing to adequately 
monitor the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment Agency Administrator Ed Avila responded angrily to Tuttle's 
comments, saying that his organization had rooted out the irregularities itself 
and is following up aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, we have moved way ahead on this and been very responsive," Avila 
said. "In the normal scheme of things around City Hall you wouldn't have audits 
like this for two or three years. I don't know what (Tuttle's) motivation is. 
Maybe it is slow this time of year over there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Emergency Rehabilitation Grant Program was established by the 
redevelopment agency and City Council just days after the riots. Money was to 
be provided to reopen damaged businesses as quickly as possible. Although the 
money provided was described as grants, business people were told they would 
have to repay the money if they subsequently received payments for the same 
work from insurance or other government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Grants totaling $2.6 million were made to 95 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a new and innovative program," Avila said. "Because of our ability 
to react very quickly, we were able to open up 95 businesses within days of 
their applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you move quickly, you take the chance and risk that there may be some 
irregularities," he added. "With most government programs, the complaint is you 
can't get them to respond at all. . . . For the most part, these grants worked 
as intended." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the CRA's own audit completed in December, not all the money 
was spent as the recipients said it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 One business spent its funds on rent rather than repairs, others made 
improvements at locations not described in their grant applications and some 
bought equipment that was not to be found when CRA auditors came calling. A 
total of more than $200,000 was "overpaid" for these purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit also found that the riot victims later received $328,000 from 
insurance and the federal Small Business Administration for the same 
improvements that the CRA had already funded. That money, however, has not been 
repaid to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the CRA found that nearly $1 million in additional insurance payments 
and small business grants went to the businesses. But not enough information 
has been provided by the businesses or their benefactors to know if the money 
went for the same purposes as the city grants. If it did, the city would be 
entitled to further reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said the CRA has known for months that money was owed to it and failed 
to demand repayment in speedy fashion. But Avila said the CRA will fervently 
pursue the money it is owed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second internal audit, the CRA found that a private security firm hired 
to patrol Hollywood Boulevard and adjacent streets has overbilled the city 
almost $25,000 and not provided the level of service it promised. 
</P>
<P>
 While the amount of overbilling has been deducted from the CRA's ongoing 
contract with Patriot Security, the audit and a subsequent review by the 
controller's office paint a troubling picture of a program once touted as a 
model for increasing police services in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, the CRA unveiled the one-year, $750,000 contract with Patriot 
Security as a way of bringing more safety to Hollywood and stemming its exodus 
of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials at the company could not be reached Friday, the audit says 
they acknowledged the overbilling had occurred after reviewing records.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; DECISION POSTPONED ON MASSAGE PARLORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has postponed making a decision on an ordinance that would 
limit massage parlors to certain areas in the city after a massage therapist 
protested the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had planned to keep businesses offering "personal services" such as 
massage, acupressure and tattooing out of the town center area and to require 
those businesses to get a special permit.According to Director of Development 
Services Joyce R. Rosenthal, several massage and acupressure establishments 
have been fronts for prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sherry Hershey, a licensed massage therapist, said that legitimate massage 
therapists, who are licensed by both the state and the city, would be hurt by 
such an ordinance. Because they get most of their referrals from the doctors' 
offices and chiropractors in the town center, Hershey said, they too need to be 
located downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Illegal massage parlors don't care where they are located," Hershey said, 
"but legitimate massage therapists want to be where the chiropractors are -- 
where the clients are." 
</P>
<P>
 Town center refers to two areas set aside by the city for retail and 
professional businesses. It is more restrictive than other commercial zones 
because the areas are seen as "gateways" to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Murphy, a real estate broker representing the owner of a business in 
the town center area, said that massage therapists blend well with the mix of 
businesses there. He said massage therapists should be required to get a permit 
but should not be banned from the town center altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing Murphy and Hershey, the council asked Rosenthal to determine how 
and if the city can allow licensed massage therapists in the town center and 
keep unlicensed ones out. The ordinance will be reconsidered in two weeks.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; SCHOOL, CITY IN THE SWIM AT NEW POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Laguna Beach High School swimming pool, the city's only community 
pool, was officially dedicated on Friday and will open to the public today. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of a larger high school renovation project, the city has been without a 
pool for 18 months, meaning residents seeking a swim last summer had to take a 
dip in the ocean or drive six miles to the YMCA pool in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's water polo team, which put on a demonstration Friday during a 
ribbon-cutting ceremony, has for the past 1 1/2 years practiced in Laguna 
Hills. Despite the inconvenience, the team advanced to the California 
Interscholastic Federation playoffs in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it's been a challenge for our water polo team," Principal Barbara 
Callard said before Friday's ceremony. "The kids really deserve a medal for 
sticking to the program and doing as well as they did. They will be the 
official first group to be back in the pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Callard said the opening of the heated 75-by-82-foot pool gives her hope that 
the disruptive larger remodeling project -- which includes the construction of 
new classrooms and the renovation of the school's theater -- may soon end. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative completion date for $13-million project is mid-April. 
SchoolPower, the district's fund-raising arm, and the Capital Campaign, a 
private fund-raising organization, are helping to pay for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the pool, at Park Avenue and Manzanita Drive, is a joint 
project of the school district and the city at a cost of $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool, which features two diving boards and an attached wading pool, will 
be open for lap swimming from 7:30 to 9 a.m. today and for recreational 
swimming from 10:15 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge is $2 for a "drop-by" swim, or an annual pool pass can be purchased 
at the city's recreation department for $100. Half-year passes good from June 
through December cost $60. Children under 2 are admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also will offer special pool-related classes as part of its winter 
recreation program. For more information, call (714) 497-0716. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STATE'S FIRST PUBLIC CEMETERY SALE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what would likely be the first sale of a public cemetery to a private 
company in California history, the Orange County Cemetery District has accepted 
a bid of $31,000 for the 120-year-old Magnolia Memorial Park Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's board of trustees, hoping to shed the site's annual $30,000 
upkeep cost, this week agreed to sell the six-acre Garden Grove cemetery to the 
Omega Society of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia Memorial Park Cemetery, founded in 1874, is the smallest of four 
cemeteries controlled by the district, which has an operating budget of $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale must also be approved by the Board of Supervisors, which will review 
the issue in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 District General Manager Sam Randall said selling the parcel will help his 
agency weather state revenue losses that are projected to total $700,000 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our budget losses are really forcing us to downsize and streamline," Randall 
said. "Last year, the revenue shift cost us another $200,000, so these are 
sizable cuts, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
 Staffing cutbacks among the district's 20 employees and a shift toward 
contract work for landscaping maintenance are other tactics being used to 
soften the budget blows, Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 No plans are underway, but Randall said the district has not ruled out selling 
one of the remaining three public cemeteries in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 But while another sale would further lighten the fiscal burden, Randall said 
there is a reluctance by the district to surrender its historic properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like selling part of the family or a family heirloom," Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board expressed a certain sadness with the sale of Magnolia because some 
of our history and pride go with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia Memorial Park Cemetery, at 12241 Magnolia St., was known as 
Westminster Cemetery until 1969, when its name was changed to avoid confusion 
with the larger, private Westminster Memorial Park.

 Among its 3,800 graves are the burial plots of early Orange County pioneers 
such as the Lampson family. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the board of trustee members from the county's original cemetery 
district, founded in 1926, are also interred there. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall, who is also president of the California Assn. of Public Cemeteries, 
said his research shows this to be the first sale of a public burial ground to 
a private company. 
</P>
<P>
 While public cemeteries are allowed by state law to use only underground 
graves, privately owned sites are permitted to build mausoleums, making more 
profitable use of space. 
</P>
<P>
 There is room for about 1,000 ground grave sites at Magnolia Memorial Park 
Cemetery, Randall said. GEOFF BOUCHER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: AZUSA; PAROLEE DIES 
AFTER FIGHT WITH DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent parolee died after being hit with a dose of pepper spray and two 
Taser darts during a fight with deputies, a Los Angeles County sheriff's 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Gizowski, 25, died at Glendora Community Hospital about two hours after 
the Thursday afternoon confrontation, spokesman Rich Erickson said.An autopsy 
will be performed to determine the cause of death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies went to an Azusa address, Erickson said, after receiving a call from 
a woman who said Gizowski was acting strangely. Seven deputies found him on a 
living room couch yelling incoherently, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He immediately jumped from the couch and fought with deputies," Erickson 
said. "Deputies used pepper spray on the suspect, but it had no visible effect. 
Deputies used the Taser on Gizowski twice, but that had no effect, either." 
</P>
<P>
 After Gizowski was restrained, he had trouble breathing and paramedics took 
him to the hospital, the sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five deputies suffered injuries, including a dislocated wrist and knee. 
Gizowski also bit a sergeant on the face and ears, Erickson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gizowski recently served 28 months in prison for possession of narcotics for 
sale.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUDGE 
TEMPORARILY HALTS PALESTINIANS' DEPORTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge on Friday ordered a temporary halt to deportation proceedings 
against six Palestinians accused of supporting a terrorist group, issuing an 
injunction barring any action against the group by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians and two other defendants make up the so-called L.A. Eight, 
who have battled to remain in the country for seven years despite allegations 
that they provided support to the Popular Liberation of Palestine.Authorities 
say the group is involved in terrorist activities, but the defendants maintain 
that it supplies only humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In granting the three-month stay, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson said 
he wanted to give the six defendants an opportunity to prove their assertion 
that the government singled them out for selective prosecution, forbidden by 
the U.S. Constitution.  
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hoffman, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern 
California, said Wilson's order "confirms what we have said all along" about 
the political nature of the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're optimistic about being vindicated when the court finally resolves the 
issue later this year," Hoffman said.

 Just another day in L.A.: Eleanor Van Natta of Hawthorne found the 
accompanying checklist on a parking receipt lying in the street and -- good 
Samaritan that she is -- sent it along to us.

 Grateful living: We mentioned a Fox TV producer's search for people who have 
been mistakenly declared deceased. The show will be called, not surprisingly, 
"I'm Not Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted a phone call from author Ib Melchior, who read us this 1987 
blurb from a publication for book buyers: " 'Code Name: Grand Guignol,' by I. 
Melchior, publisher Dodd Mead, has been canceled due to the death of the 
author." 
</P>
<P>
 Melchior, who has written several subsequent books ("Case by Case" is his 
latest), suspects the error may have been made because his editor had just 
died. Oddly enough, Melchior's father, a famous opera singer, had a similar 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1967 I was sitting at a TV set with my father, Lauritz," he recalled, "and 
we heard an announcer say: 'We regret to inform you that the great Wagnerian 
tenor Lauritz Melchior has passed away.' My father called up the station and 
said, 'This is the corpse speaking. . . .' "

 Close but one banana: It's sad that Downey's Hopalong Cassidy Museum will 
close at the end of this month, as The Times reported Friday. But the shrine 
didn't even merit a "so long" from Sunset magazine, whose January issue pays 
tribute to "Southern California's most unusual museums." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Sunset confines its salute to the Banana Museum of Altadena (run by 
Ken Bannister a.k.a. Bananaster), the Ralph M. Parsons Insect Zoo at the L.A. 
County Natural History Museum and West L.A.'s Museum of Jurassic Technology, 
which has nothing to do with dinosaurs or Jurassic technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jurassic does boast such exhibits as "a horn that grew from a woman's 
head, a display devoted to the Deprong Mori bat . . . and a diorama of a 
Cameroon rain forest where crazed stink ants cling to vines."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; HOTEL AGREES TO PAY CITY BACK BED TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city and the Dana Point Hilton have reached an agreement on a plan that 
allows the hotel to pay overdue bed taxes, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a meeting of city officials and representatives of the nearly 2-year-old 
hotel earlier this week, City Atty.Jerry Patterson announced that the hotel had 
agreed to pay about $90,000 in back taxes, possibly within 30 days. He declined 
to comment on the specifics of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been an agreement reached," Patterson said. He said the exact 
amount the 197-room hotel must pay the city "depends on whether it is paid soon 
or over a couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement came five days after the city filed suit in Orange County 
Superior Court seeking $120,000 from the hotel for past-due taxes dating back 
to April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The city agreed to waive certain penalties if the hotel pays the back taxes 
quickly, Patterson said: "It's a good agreement for the city that gives (the 
hotel) a great incentive to pay early." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the back taxes nor interest was negotiable, and those funds must be 
paid in full, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city code requires each of the 15 local hotels and motels to add a 10% 
surcharge to its room rates for a transient occupancy tax, commonly called a 
bed tax. The revenue from the taxes are due to the city monthly, 20 days after 
the final day of the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 The city depends on bed taxes for more than a third of its nearly $11 million 
in annual revenues, according to city officials.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; FIRM HIRED TO DEFEND CITY IN FEDERAL SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week approved hiring a Los Angeles law firm to defend 
the city and 32 city employees, consultants and former and present council 
members in a federal suit filed by two residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, which was approved on a 4-1 vote, was necessary because City Atty. 
James L. Markman is named in the lawsuit, said City Manager Frank Benest, who 
also is named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we think that this action is without merit, we, of course, have to 
defend the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 William M. Vega and his mother, Marina Vega, claim the city and other 
defendants conspired to illegally acquire Marina Vega's Brea Boulevard 
properties for a highway widening and redevelopment project. They filed the 
suit Nov. 30 in U.S. District Court and are seeking more than $10 million in 
compensatory damages and $10 million from each defendant in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants' actions "were malicious, reckless, oppressive and motivated by 
evil intent," the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry L. Steering of the Melvin Belli law firm in Beverly Hills is 
representing the Vegas in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The law firm of Richards, Watson & Gershon will defend the city and the other 
defendants at a cost that could top $150,000 if the case goes to trial, Benest 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn E. Wiser, the only current council member not named in the suit, cast 
the dissenting vote to hire the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 She said city officials and employees should be represented by separate 
counsel and that consultants, which were hired by the city, should be 
represented by someone else because of possible conflicts among the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city may have rights against the other parties," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Benest said there is no conflict among the defendants and that hiring 
separate lawyers would double the cost. If a conflict is found, however, 
separate lawyers would then be recommended, he added.MIMI KO

EMPLOYEE NAMED ANIMAL REGULATION CHIEF 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-month search for an administrator at the Los Angeles Department of Animal 
Regulation has ended with the selection of Gary S. Olsen, a 24-year employee 
who has served as the department's interim chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Animal Regulation Commission selected Olsen this week after the top 
candidate for the job dropped out, citing concerns that Mayor Richard Riordan's 
Administration would collapse the department into the county Department of 
Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen, 50, will be paid about $90,000 a year. He will oversee a department 
that has been criticized for keeping animals under poor conditions and 
destroying pets before owners could claim them.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; SUSPECTS IN 
KILLINGS ARE HIDING HERE, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena police and the FBI say they believe both suspects still wanted in the 
fatal shootings of three teen-agers on Halloween night are hiding out in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI trailed Herbert McClain, 22, through four states before nearly 
cornering him in Kansas City, Mo., said Charlie J. Parsons, special agent in 
charge of the Los Angeles FBI office. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents believe that McClain returned to Pasadena, his hometown. "He is not a 
mental giant, and people commonly return home," Parsons said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The second suspect, Solomon Bowen, 22, is believed to have remained in hiding 
in Pasadena throughout the investigation, Pasadena Police Chief Jerry Oliver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 McClain and Bowen are suspects in the ambush-style murders of Steven Coats and 
Reggie Crawford, both 14, and Edgar Evans, 13, as the youths walked home from a 
Halloween party Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other suspects -- Lorenzo Newborn, 23; Aurelius Bailey, 19, and Karl 
Holmes, 19 -- were arrested by Pasadena police Dec. 23. The FBI joined the 
investigation Dec. 27, Oliver said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; EDISON STUDENTS GET EGGED ON BY PHYSICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kara Stokes, 16, practiced for her school's annual physics egg drop until 1:30 
a.m. Friday, dropping eggs from her rooftop. 
</P>
<P>
 Her work paid off later in the day at Edison High School when she cushioned a 
raw egg with about 20 marshmallows in an old coffee can that she had modified 
into a safe travel conveyance. 
</P>
<P>
 The can was dropped about 60 feet from a tree-trimming rig to a concrete 
landing area, and the egg survived intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Kara was one of about 180 students who participated in the egg-drop contest, 
an annual event that challenges students to devise ways to pack or suspend eggs 
in containers so they won't break. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of several special physics projects scheduled in the year to test 
real world application to textbook theories, said Steve Johnson, science 
department chairman at Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said about 60% of Edison's graduates take physics classes, reportedly 
one of the highest rates in the state. Physics is important because it helps 
students prepare for a technological society, he said. In Friday's experiment, 
the students learned practical aspects about gravity, force, aerodynamics and 
velocity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Biagi, 17, wrapped his egg in transparent plastic and placed it in a 
small box stuffed with popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make it as light as possible so it would slow down the speed," he 
said. "The only weight was the egg. I've been thinking about it for a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Biagi's egg made a soft landing and didn't crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison Principal Brian Garland said that in the egg-dropping contest, students 
are "doing something directly related to the classroom, but packaged in a way 
that they really enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some met with profound success, and some met with scrambled eggs." ROBERT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; DISTRICT OKS SCHOOL BOUNDARY CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the objections of about 20 angry parents, the governing board of the 
Garden Grove Unified School District approved high school boundary changes for 
the 1994-95 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting Tuesday, the Board of Education unanimously approved 
the changes, which are designed to balance the student populations at 
overcrowded campuses with those that have surplus classroom space. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes only affect about 290 students entering high school next year at 
the ninth-grade level and do not affect students currently attending high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of parents, students, staff and teachers proposed the changes last 
year, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until May 1, parents whose children are affected by the changes, particularly 
those who have other children in high school, may request that their children 
stay together. Having children at two high schools would affect parents' 
transportation scheduling and students' after-school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Those applications will receive priority over other transfer requests, 
although space limitations may require that a lottery be used to decide which 
requests are granted, said Andrew McTaggert, assistant superintendent for 
secondary education. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Tuesday meeting, several parents complained that the district excluded 
them from the decision-making process by failing to notify them of proposed 
changes. They also feared there would be insufficient space to accommodate all 
the siblings requesting transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although trustees acknowledged before the vote that the changes would be 
inconvenient for some, they said they were intended to benefit the greatest 
number of students. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what school your child goes to, (he or she will) still get a 
similar education," Trustee Joyce T. Johnson told the crowd. "We'll try to 
please everyone, but pleasing everyone is not the easiest thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students living in the existing Rancho Alamitos High School attendance 
area will attend Pacifica High School next year. They include those who live in 
the area bounded by Orangewood Avenue to the north, Garden Grove Boulevard to 
the south, Beach Boulevard to the east and Western Avenue to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease crowding at Santiago High School, some students now living in that 
attendance area will be shifted to two other campuses. Those living in the area 
bounded by Hazard Avenue to the north, 1st Street to the south, the Santa Ana 
River to the east and Harbor Boulevard to the west will attend Los Amigos High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Students residing in the area bounded by the Garden Grove Freeway to the 
north, Hazard Avenue to the south, Newhope Street to the east and Euclid Street 
to the west will go to Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Students living in the Garden Grove attendance area who will attend Rancho 
Alamitos include those who live within the area bounded by Katella Avenue to

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; MEETING TO DISCUSS CLEARED RIGHT-OF-WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last of the rusting tracks were removed from a 1.3-mile railroad 
right-of-way in 1984. And for most of the last decade, Northwood village 
residents and city officials have been debating what to do with the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to transform the undeveloped land into a park will take a major step 
forward with a community meeting this morning to discuss how to design the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will take place at 9 a.m. at Sierra Vista Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be moderated by Lawrence Halprin, a noted San Francisco landscape 
architect who volunteered his time for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who live along the narrow strip of land hope the meeting is the 
first step in developing a park complete with a trail for walking and perhaps 
bike riding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited that we are finally at this point," said resident Ann 
Cleland, who lives next to the Northwood Abandoned Railroad Right of Way, or 
NARROW. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will give residents a chance to discuss ideas for the park with 
Halprin, and take a tour of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials aren't sure how much it will cost to develop the site, but the bill 
is expect to run more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do with the right-of-way has been the subject of much debate over the 
last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents opposed one proposal to make it part of a regional bike trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of having residents buy chunks of land next to their homes was also 
ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 The city settled on a plan for a "linear park" with a path running through it. 
</P>
<P>
 The land is an average of 65 feet wide, so Cleland doubts a playground or 
exercise circuit would fit in it. The right-of-way runs from Culver Drive to 
Jeffrey Road and is lined by homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleland said some residents are concerned about protecting the safety of 
pedestrians who must cross major streets such as Yale Avenue when walking the 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue likely to be discussed at the meeting is security and privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most homes that back up against the right-of-way are separated by walls, but 
the interiors of some homes remain visible.SHELBY GRAD

WILSON, LATINO LEADERS DISCUSS IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and a delegation of Latino officeholders seeking to improve 
the quality of debate over immigration met Friday and found themselves in 
agreement on at least two important issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and the elected officials from Los Angeles agreed on the need for 
greater economic development in the home countries of immigrants and on the 
importance of retaining civilian control of U.S. borders, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other issues -- the right to U.S. citizenship of children born to illegal 
immigrants and providing publicly financed health care and education to illegal 
immigrants -- remained in dispute between the governor and the Latino 
officeholders, all Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 However, representatives of the governor and PRIDE -- Proponents for 
Responsible Immigration Debate and Education -- called the private, 65-minute 
session in Wilson's office helpful in establishing a dialogue over immigration 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 PRIDE is made up of local, state and federal elected officeholders from Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Legislature's 
Latino Caucus, termed the meeting "historic and a success. The governor 
indicated he wants and is open to more information. He welcomes more meetings." 
Beth Miller, a Wilson spokeswoman who attended the early evening meeting, 
called it an "excellent beginning to a good dialogue" even if the two sides did 
not reach agreement on all issues. 
</P>
<P>
 PRIDE was recently organized to promote a higher level of public debate over 
the emotion-charged immigration issue during this election year.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose here is to promote a reasonable debate and discussion on public 
policy as it affects the undocumented and (legal) immigrants," Supervisor 
Gloria Molina of Los Angeles County told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Other participants included Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, Councilman Mike 
Hernandez and Assemblywomen Martha M. Escutia of Huntington Park, Hilda Solis 
of El Monte and Grace Napolitano of Norwalk.

COUNTY MAY EXCLUDE PERKS FROM PENSIONS; BENEFITS: RETIRING OFFICIAL WILL GET A 
YEARLY PAYOUT ABOUT $35,000 MORE THAN HIS SALARY. MOLINA WANTS CHANGES IN THE 
CALCULATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is set to decide next month 
whether to eliminate a rule that allows fringe benefits to be counted as part 
of compensation when calculating an employee's pension. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of pension reform has received renewed scrutiny recently with the 
disclosure that because of the fringe benefit rule, public works Director 
Thomas A. Tidemanson will be able to retire in March with a yearly pension that 
is about $35,000 more than his annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to Supervisor Gloria Molina said Friday that she is working on several 
motions to revise pension rules, including one that would prevent the kind of 
lucrative deal that Tidemanson will receive. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have is an individual who did put in his time and who is a good 
employee but is able to walk away with more money than he was making (with the 
county). That rubs people the wrong way," Molina spokesman Robert Alaniz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said she too believes that reforms must be 
instituted, but cautioned that changes will have to be negotiated with employee 
unions and may land the county in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to remember that people gave up certain things to get current 
benefits, so there will have to be careful review," she said. "But we do have 
to move forward with a new method of calculating benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled to consider pension reforms at its Feb. 8 meeting. 
Among items that will probably be discussed is a report by the county Citizens 
Economy and Efficiency Commission, which also recommended limiting pension 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Tidemanson, 61, announced this week that he is retiring after more than 38 
years of county service. He has served as director of the Department of Public 
Works since 1985 at an annual salary of $157,586. Under current rules, 
Tidemanson will be able to count more than $36,000 in fringe benefits -- 
including a $6,000 car allowance -- as salary when calculating his pension. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, under his retirement plan, Tidemanson is eligible to receive 
about 99% of his highest annual salary, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule was implemented in 1991 by former Chief Administrative Officer 
Richard B. Dixon and led to a so-called pension-spiking scandal when it was 
determined that the change would cost taxpayers $265 million to $400 million 
over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting uproar led to Dixon's retirement under pressure in February. A 
taxpayers group also sued to block the pension rule but a judge dismissed the 
suit.

ERIK MENENDEZ'S TESTIMONY ON SEXUAL IDENTITY REVIEWED; TRIAL: JURY TAKES NOTES 
WHILE LISTENING TO DEFENDANT'S EARLIER DESCRIPTION OF CONFUSION ABOUT HIS 
ORIENTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Erik Menendez's jury was read back testimony Friday about his "confused" 
sexual orientation, an issue that emerged late in the Menendez brothers' murder 
trial as prosecutors suggested that it might provide a motive to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, in its 15th day of deliberations, sent a note asking to hear "all 
testimony about or allusions to Erik's homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the jurors then took copious notes of Erik Menendez's testimony that 
he was "real confused" about his sexual identity, that his father called him 
"faggot" and that his mother gave him a deadline to get a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 As the testimony was read back, Erik Menendez, 23, sat silently, showing no 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his brother, Lyle Menendez, 25, are charged with murder in the Aug. 20, 
1989, shotgun slayings of their parents, Jose Menendez, 45, a wealthy 
entertainment executive, and Kitty Menendez, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers admit the killings but said they fired in fear after years of 
physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Prosecutors contend that the brothers 
killed out of hatred and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing arguments Dec. 15, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lester Kuriyama suggested 
that Erik Menendez is gay, and that his sexual orientation -- not molestation 
by his father -- fed the family friction that led to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 If Erik Menendez is gay, Kuriyama said, that would explain how he could have 
described for jurors various sex acts that he testified his father forced him 
to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors pressed throughout the five-month trial for permission to explore 
the sensitive issue at length. But defense attorneys fought any explicit 
references to homosexuality, with Erik Menendez's attorney, Leslie Abramson, 
calling the tactic "disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 Without explaining why, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg 
limited the prosecution's questioning, though he did allow Kuriyama to offer 
his theory during closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the testimony read back Friday, Erik Menendez denied he that he is a 
homosexual, but said -- during Sept. 29 questioning by Abramson -- that he was 
confused because of the alleged molestation.  
</P>
<P>
 His father also taunted him, calling him "faggot," he said, so he imagined a 
retort in his own mind: "Then what the hell are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Erik Menendez said, "made it sound worse than death to be gay," 
and once ordered him to find a girlfriend within a few months -- which, he 
said, he did. 
</P>
<P>
 In other testimony read back Friday, jurors heard how Beverly Hills 
psychologist L. Jerome Oziel described for the Menendez brothers the difference 
between premeditated murder and a killing committed in the heat of passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Oziel, who testified for the prosecution, said Lyle Menendez then indicated 
that they had killed with premeditation. But jurors also heard Lyle Menendez's 
testimony that he never said that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lyle Menendez jury worked through a 17th day of deliberations without 
asking any questions.

'BEVERLY HILLS 90210' STARS HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT; ENTERTAINMENT: VAN NUYS 
COURTROOM IS CLOAKED IN SECRECY AS TV CREWS SHOOT MYSTERY-MARRIAGE EPISODE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Department A of the Van Nuys Superior Court, a palace of paperwork where 
civil cases are assigned out to judges, there usually is little noticeable 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday morning -- cloaked in intense secrecy -- a drama was being 
played out in the courtroom's chambers. Was it about a verdict in the Menendez 
brothers' murder trial, or the sentencing of "Super Freak" singer Rick James on 
drug and assault charges? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. The television show "Beverly Hills 90210" was shooting a marriage 
scene, and Dylan, Brenda and company were present as a member of their clique 
tied the knot for an upcoming show. The episode will be the final chapter in 
the season's big mystery: Who got pregnant? 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to keep that plot twist under wraps abounded: in the hallway leading 
to the courtroom stood a seemingly endless line of security guards. Three long 
black tarps hung from frames to block public view of the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, curious attorneys and courtroom clerks gossiped and snooped on 
the proceedings, acting remarkably like the show's mostly teen-aged fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason Priestley (who plays Brandon Walsh) looks real good," said court clerk 
Ann Papa, hoping for an autograph. "He's short though." 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys seemed less than impressed with the cast of the popular 
teen-age soap opera. Several, seeing all the movie trailers outside the 
courthouse, assumed that the jury had reached a verdict in the Menendez trial. 
Others knew what was up, but still got it only part right. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're shooting Beverly Hills 90275," said one man, when asked what the fuss 
was all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Before filming inside Presiding Judge Robert M. Letteau's courtroom, crew 
members had made cosmetic changes to make it look more like a courtroom. They 
placed fake wood paneling throughout and covered the clocks with California 
State seals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said that the pea-green paint reflected badly on the female characters," 
Letteau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Letteau arranged for his two daughters, Lara, 23, and Loren, 14, to sit in on 
the shoot along with friend Amy Park, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Erving Hudes was scheduled to settle a case in Letteau's courtroom 
Friday, but said he was not annoyed by the change in plans. Hudes now had a 
story to tell his 12-year-old daughter, Kristine. "When she hears that I was on 
the set of 90210, she'll go gaga," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the show's security measures, most fans around the courthouse 
agreed that any discriminating 90210 watcher will easily guess who is getting 
married. 
</P>
<P>
 And just who is pregnant? According to the court clerks, it's Andrea 
Zuckerman, played by Gabrielle Carteris, who is pregnant in real life (big 
surprise). She's marrying the character Jesse. The episode is scheduled to air 
Feb. 9.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; COUNCIL OKS $258,000 FOR ALLEYWAY REPAIRS

<P>
 Alleys off Beach Boulevard between Manchester Boulevard and Franklin Street 
are in such bad shape that the City Council this week approved spending 
$258,000 to repair the narrow drives behind businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The council awarded the construction contract to Nobest Inc. of Garden 
Grove.To pay for the alleyway rehabilitation, the city will use federal grant 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, approved by the council last November, will involve paving the 
deteriorated public alleys and installing gutters to improve drainage. The 
ramps and driveway accesses on both sides of Beach Boulevard will also be 
paved. 
</P>
<P>
 On the east side of the boulevard, improvements will be made from Manchester 
Boulevard to Franklin Street and, on the west side, from just north of 5th 
Street to Franklin Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction will be done in segments to minimize any inconvenience so that 
customers and employees will still have access to businesses and homes, said 
Nabil S. Henein, deputy city engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements are expected to start Jan. 24. Notifications of the construction 
schedule will also be sent next week to business owners and residents, Henein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to be completed by the end of March, weather 
permitting.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; RECYCLED WATER TO BE USED IN PRIVATE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By May, a 22-acre private park is planned to be the next greenbelt in the city 
to be sprinkled with recycled water. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to conserve potable water supplies, the city has taken part in an 
Orange County Water District program to use recycled water for landscaped 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the Fountain Valley Recreation Center area of Mile Square Regional 
Park and the park's golf course are irrigated with the reclaimed water. Plans 
are to hook up the David L. Baker Golf Center to the system by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Valley's recreation area, on the north and south sides of Slater Avenue 
between Ward and Euclid streets, is owned and maintained by the Green Valley 
Homeowners' Recreation Assn. The housing development, built more than 20 years 
ago, has 1,048 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 To get Green Valley's irrigation system on-line with the recycled water 
program, the City Council this week approved spending up to $10,000 to install 
connecting pipelines, which are projected to cost $40,000. The council also 
decided to advertise the project for bids. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district will pay $30,000 of the construction cost, said Wayne S. 
Osborne, director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne said the homeowners' association has already spent $10,000 to make 
changes in the park's existing irrigation system to allow the use of recycled 
water. Such work included disconnecting drinking fountains from the irrigation 
system and installing smaller sprinkler heads to avoid over-spray on sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne said the city's initial $10,000 cost would be more than offset by 
projected annual revenue of about $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Osborne said recycled water reduces the demand for the city to 
buy potable water, which is more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Moss, Green Valley's recreation grounds and maintenance manager, said 
another advantage is that fertilizer is not needed with recycled water since it 
has nitrate, which is used as a fertilizer. DEBRA CANO

 After more than a year without a permanent school superintendent, the Orange 
Unified School District may hire one by the end of February, according to a 
tentative timetable released by school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 With the election of four new board members, the district has recently stepped 
up its recruiting efforts for the top administrative job and expects to 
interview between three and five candidates in early February, according to the 
timetable.The school board, which will make the final selection for 
superintendent, has not interviewed any candidates yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lee Newcomer, an educational consultant hired by the district to expedite 
the superintendent search, will discuss the criteria for the superintendent 
spot at a school board meeting Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 During a special meeting of the school board Wednesday, trustees expressed 
concerns about investigating the past of potential superintendent candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody has any skeletons in their closet or any problems, you will know 
about it from me," Newcomer said. "I'm a real bearcat on that." MARTIN MILLER

CLAIMS AGAINST STATE FILED IN CRASH FATAL TO 2; TRAFFIC: DAUGHTERS OF DEAD 
COUPLE AND FRIENDS SAY DR. RONALD JOSEPH ALLEN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LICENSED 
FOR DRIVING OR PRACTICING MEDICINE. 
</P>

 A Laguna Beach doctor who collided head-on with a car carrying a Mission Viejo 
family, killing both parents, should not have possessed a driver's license nor 
a medical license, according to claims against the state filed by the family's 
daughters and other survivors of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ronald Joseph Allen, 31, crashed into the Minzey family as they returned 
from a softball game on July 11, 1993. The parents, Noreen and Mark, were 
killed instantly, and one daughter was critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was later charged with second-degree murder and driving under the 
influence of both drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 29, the Minzeys' daughters, Karie, 11, and Shelbie Minzey, 15, filed a 
$30-million claim with the state charging that both the California Department 
of Motor Vehicles and the Medical Board of California should have acted sooner 
in revoking Allen's license to drive and to practice medicine, said their 
attorney, Daniel W. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Two friends of the Minzeys, sisters Danielle Rodriguez, 12, and Jacqueline 
Rodriguez, 24, also survived the accident and have filed similar claims with 
the state, according to the offices of their attorney, Garry Moorhead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rodriguezes, who were in the Minzey car, were treated and released from 
UCI Medical Center the day of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen had been arrested in June on suspicion of public intoxication and 
resisting arrest. As a result, his driver's license had been revoked. But 10 
days later, he got a temporary license from the DMV. To get it, authorities 
allege, he failed to disclose that his Illinois driver's license had been 
revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson also alleged that the DMV "issued a temporary license to a person who 
had already had his license revoked by court order. The DMV violated the court 
order."  
</P>
<P>
 But a DMV spokesman said Allen was driving with an invalid license. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that can be substantiated with the evidence at hand," DMV 
spokesman Bill Madison said. Allen did not have "driving privileges in the 
state of California at the time of the accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's medical license was temporarily suspended in August. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson said that Allen's medical license had allowed him to obtain the 
amphetamines he had allegedly taken on the day of the fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical Board spokesperson Candis Cohen, who saw the Rodriguezes' claim 
Friday, said: "The Medical Board rejects the claim that it is in any way 
responsible for the injuries of the Rodriguez sisters. Dr. Allen chose to 
ingest drugs and alcohol and then drive. We dispute the idea that any earlier 
action against his medical license would have prevented this tragedy, which is 
solely his responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen awaits trial in Orange County Jail. He faces up to life in prison if 
convicted.

MAJOR RELIGIOUS GROUPS CONTINUE TO LOSE MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the high-stakes game of denominational musical chairs, the big winner of 
the '90s may be no church at all. 
</P>
<P>
 A new study on religious mobility in America has found that many Americans 
have given up the religious tradition they grew up with and not replaced it, or 
have turned to another form of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholics and conservative Protestants are the most loyal, but even large 
segments of their memberships are showing increasingly marginal ties to their 
denominations, researchers say in the latest issue of the Review of Religious 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
 The social pressure to belong to an organized religious group, which reached 
its height in the 1950s, doesn't seem to apply. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become quite acceptable these days to be nothing throughout your life," 
said C. Kirk Hadaway of the United Church Board of Homeland Ministries. "It 
doesn't really matter what you are anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In the study "All in the Family: Religious Mobility in America," Hadaway and 
sociologist Penny Long Marler of Samford University in Birmingham, Ala., looked 
at religious switching patterns from 1973 to 1990 based on General Social 
Survey interviews collected by the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 In that period, conservative Protestants, such as Southern Baptists and 
members of the Assemblies of God, surpassed Catholics as the group most likely 
to stay in the religious tradition they were raised in. In surveys from 1988 to 
1990, 83% of adults raised as conservative Protestants said they remained 
conservative Protestants, compared to 81% of Roman Catholics who stayed in the 
Catholic Church. The percentages were nearly reversed in surveys taken from 
1973 to 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent survey, liberal Protestants including Episcopalians and 
Presbyterians were least likely to stay within the denominational family, with 
only 63% of individuals surveyed between 1988 and 1990 saying they remained 
liberal Protestants. The loyalty rate for moderate Protestants was slightly 
higher at 67%. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the net effect of religious switching, Hadaway found that all 
the nation's major religious groups lost members. The net loss ranged from 1% 
for conservative Protestant groups to 16% for moderate Protestant groups, which 
included the United Methodist Church and other denominations that have endured 
dramatic membership losses in the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Protestant denominations lost 2%, and the Catholic Church experienced 
a net loss of 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 The big gains from religious switching came in the "other" and "none" 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an 86% increase in individuals switching to no religious affiliation 
in the surveys from 1988 to 1990. Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and Christian 
Scientists had a net gain of 33% through religious switching. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociological trends such as the decline of the traditional family, one of the 
"bread-and-butter" constituencies most likely to pass on the faith to future 
generations, increases the gravity of the challenges faced by the nation's 
largest churches, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current situation poses serious problems and concerns for all 
denominations," Marler and Hadaway say. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologists Benton Johnson of the University of Oregon and William McKinney 
of Hartford Seminary said the study findings are consistent with other research 
indicating the loosening of religious ties in the newest generations. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney said there are signs that mainline Protestant denominations, such as 
the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the United Methodist Church, which were 
hit with the first wave of steep membership declines showing the weakness of 
"inherited religion," are starting to address the issues of passing on the 
faith to future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on updating church hymnals, developing statements of faith and involving 
congregations in major church policy pronouncements instead of developing them 
on high from national headquarters indicate "a new kind of realism" among 
mainline congregations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hadaway and Marler appear to be less optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 They say mainline churches have tended to rely on the children of members and 
the hope that dropouts will return when they marry, but at the same time have 
neglected church school "and other aspects of religious socialization that 
could help translate those hopes into reality."

 INTERVIEW WITH THE CATHOLICOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His Holiness Karekin II, the Catholicos, or pope, of the Armenian Apostolic 
Church, began a three-week pontifical visit to California on Tuesday. In an 
interview this week with Times religion writer Larry B. Stammer, Karekin, 62, 
spoke about the threat of secularism, cultural issues for Armenian Americans, 
and the possibility of reunification with the other major Armenian Orthodox 
body, the Armenian Church of North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some excerpts from the interview: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Are there problems that confront young parishioners that are unique 
or more acute here? I'm thinking in terms of materialism or the secular society 
intruding upon the spiritual life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: That is one of my continuous concerns in the last few years -- the 
growth to extreme degrees of the secularizing tendency in the world. Now young 
people are naturally affected by this movement and I find it quite normal. . . 
. In this world the secular aspects of our life are quite logical. We do not 
live somewhere between here and the heavens, but we live here on this Earth. I 
consider, theologically speaking, the world being part of God's creation and 
therefore the world is for men and women. . . . What I am not finding so 
healthy is that there is now a tendency of absolutizing the worldliness, the 
secular concept of life -- that life is nothing else or nothing more than being 
conditioned by the criteria of time and space on this world. . . . I am 
concerned with the absence of God-consciousness. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q How does the church in this post-modern age speak to people? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A To put it simply as I can, the church is saying to all the people, young and 
old, the one clear message, namely that God became man for the sake of man and 
the world. . . . The church is saying to the people: You cannot be yourselves 
in your truest and highest and most authentic image without having in you the 
spark of God's presence, because you are created with that image of God. 
Therefore, this (Christmastime) is a time of cleansing of that image from the 
spots of extreme worldliness and sinfulness in which we human beings are so 
often tempted to become victims. Christmas for me is the mirror of God in which 
we look once more to find ourselves, and that mirror is such a mirror in which 
we cannot deceive ourselves. We cannot see our image distorted because the 
image is above our capacity of manipulation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Do you see the church universal, not only the Armenian Apostolic Church, as 
successfully communicating that (message)? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A I must confess, not sufficiently. There are, of course, attempts which I 
value very much. But we also, sometimes in the church, have become part of that 
secular interpretation of life of the Christmas message. Many of our 
parishioners, including clergy and also those more directly involved in the 
church, are very much taken up with the worldly aspects of the celebration. But 
now I must add that there are signs of a renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q America has the reputation -- perhaps sometimes more myth than real -- of 
being the great melting pot. Some people think a better metaphor would be salad 
bowl, in that people maintain their distinctive cultural identities while still 
being part of a whole. Is it a concern of yours that as Armenian Americans are 
assimilated into the majority culture, that some of the old ways and rich 
heritage will be lost? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A First of all, I don't like either of the terms -- melting pot or salad bowl. 
I like a more poetic word: mosaic. A mosaic is a colorful picture in which all 
colors are maintained, but the colors do not speak for themselves. The colors 
speak in their relationship with one another in what we call in the artistic 
world an aesthetic understanding, the harmony. Here you have the harmony. . . . 
That is Americanism -- the sense of belonging to an entity without which all 
the communities would lose their real strength and power. . . . We have had 
always in our history a diaspora but not to this extent. Therefore, sharing our 
identify with another identity is part of our historical experience and it has 
not been detrimental to us when it has been maintained in the right 
perspective. . . . I would say that (in) America . . . our Armenian people . . 
. have their own special color. I don't know how valuable that is. That is up 
to the American nation to judge. But personally I feel that it is like playing 
the part of the flute in the orchestra of American life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q You mentioned the diaspora. Do you see now with the collapse of the Soviet 
Union and the beginnings of independence on the part of the former Soviet 
republics that the diaspora can be reversed, that people may return to their 
homelands? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A I feel that with the new conditions in Armenia, with the hardest conditions 
that have been created since Armenia proclaimed its independence, these 
conditions are not conducive for the Armenians in the diaspora to return or to 
be repatriated to their motherland. But more important than that -- and I 
insist on this -- the Armenians in the diaspora . . . have been so much 
integrated into the life of their new countries that humanly speaking, 
psychologically speaking, economically speaking, practically speaking, I don't 
see that it would be such an easy movement for most of them to think of 
repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What are the prospects within the two branches of the Armenian Church of 
reunification of the two administrative bodies, which already share one liturgy 
and one theology? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A I wouldn't speak at this stage of reunification, but close rapprochement, 
unreserved collaboration and a process of association in which the oneness of 
faith, liturgy and the spiritual unity are given concrete expression. 
Administrative unification is a difficult process. I am not saying impossible, 
but difficult, given the circumstances of our historical development on the one 
hand and the present-day uncertainties in our Armenian life and unresolved 
problems yet within our motherland and also the diaspora. I would like to add 
at the same time that the last five years have given us greater hope for 
accelerated and enlarged extensive collaboration. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What do you think of the decision by the Vatican and the state of Israel to 
establish full diplomatic relations? What meaning does it have for the rest of 
the Middle East? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A It surely is an important event that will affect, to a certain extent, the 
whole area, including the Christian churches. But this is a beginning. It is 
not yet a final act as I understand it. We look forward to seeing how the 
Vatican will maintain the balance between its relationships with Israel and its 
relationships with the Arab world. . . . I felt some kind of uneasiness among 
the Muslims. But if it is rightly interpreted and rightly conducted in the 
future I think it may have also something that can be a benefit to the whole 
area -- to the Jews, Muslims and Christians.

GRATEFUL SURVIVOR VISITS HER RESCUERS AT FIREHOUSE; ACCIDENT: NICHOLE LEEANN 
MILLER, WHO SEVERED HER JUGULAR VEIN, BRINGS FLOWERS AND BREAD FOR THE 
PARAMEDICS WHO RUSHED HER TO THE HOSPITAL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old woman who severed her jugular vein in a freak accident last 
month visited a county firehouse here Friday to thank the paramedics who helped 
save her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to thank these guys for all they did for me," said Nichole Leeann 
Miller, who brought a bright bouquet of flowers and a basket of bread to show 
her gratitude to the men who were summoned from their beds in the pre-dawn 
hours of Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was greeted with hugs by paramedics Eric Leverenz and Skip Hawkins, who 
administered intravenous solutions and rushed her by ambulance to Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the paramedics and firefighters at the firehouse on Del Obispo 
Street gave Miller a tour of the facility, a hamburger lunch and a T-shirt 
signed by the paramedics who came to her rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Leverenz, who had visited Miller in the hospital, said that "for most of the 
calls we go out on, the outcomes are not so good. When they come back to say 
'thank you' it is very gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said that her neck, which shows a small scar after emergency surgery to 
close the blood vessel, still hurts. She said she has had "a few good cries" 
since she woke from surgery and realized how close she came to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, who lives in Wisconsin with her grandparents, had been staying 
with her father, Wayne, in Dana Point during the Christmas holiday. Family 
members said Nichole had been suffering from a chest cold and got up from the 
living room sofa, where she had been sleeping, about 5:30 a.m. to drink a glass 
of water. 
</P>
<P>
 But then she fainted, dropped the glass and fell on the shards, which sliced 
into her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Miller's fiancee, Suzie Breedlove, was praised last week by medical 
personnel for slowing Nichole's profuse bleeding by applying pressure to the 
gaping wound with her hands and a towel, and for dialing 911. 
</P>
<P>
 But Breedlove, who accompanied Nichole to the firehouse Friday with Nichole's 
father and grandmother, said the paramedics were a welcome sight that traumatic 
morning. Wayne Miller said when he heard the fire engine coming, he ran outside 
to flag it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did do our part, but without (the paramedics) I don't know I would have 
lasted another minute," said Breedlove, who is a laboratory technician at 
Saddleback Memorial Medical Center in Laguna Hills.

YOUTHS AT BAPTIST CONVENTION PLEDGE CHASTITY TILL MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a thousand teen-agers at a Baptist convention signed cards vowing to 
remain virgins until marriage, joining other youths nationwide who have taken 
similar pledges of celibacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virginity is the greatest gift you can give your future mate," Seth 
Rodriquez, 17, said last week to cheers from other teen-agers at the Southern 
Baptist State Youth Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriquez was one of about 1,200 convention-goers who signed "True Love Waits" 
cards, pledging themselves to God and promising to remain chaste. 
</P>
<P>
 Other churches and organizations have joined the program. By July the 
coalition hopes to gather 500,000 signed pledges for display in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Prall, youth pastor at El Toro Baptist Church, said he sees the campaign 
as a way to get youths thinking about the sacredness of their sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to get them to make sexual choices now instead of waiting until 
they're in the back seat of a car," he said.

 A Los Angeles Jewish children's museum Sunday will open its newest exhibit, 
called "My Family's Roots and Routes." 
</P>
<P>
 My Jewish Discovery Place Children's Museum of Jewish Community Centers Assn., 
which has been visited by more than 10,000 children and adults since it opened 
a year and a half ago, is an interactive, experiential museum geared toward 
teaching Jewish values.  
</P>
<P>
 The latest exhibit focuses on the family, as well as immigrant journeys to 
this country, said Esther Netter, museum executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "In celebrating immigrant cultures from around the world, it has both a 
specific Jewish message and also a very universal one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit will include an eight-foot-tall Statue of Liberty made with 12 
interactive cubbyholes. Each will be filled with a re-creation of an 
immigrant's memento, such as a grandmother's pearl necklace, a baby quilt or a 
pair of candlesticks. Each item will have an immigrant's story attached to it.  
</P>
<P>
 Additional highlights include a time travel machine to Spain in the 1400s, 
flight simulation to Israel and a dollhouse synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the museum, children are encouraged to touch, put on costumes and 
to become part of the exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Families and children that come become their own teachers," Netter said. 
"Through their imagination, they visit Ellis Island, they talk to life-size 
dolls and hear their experience, they put their feet into shoes from around the 
world. It demands, in the best sense, the use of one's imagination and creative 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortuna Ippoliti, 42, a docent at the museum, said she appreciates the center 
for "filling a spiritual void. I didn't know anything about my religion; now 
I'm learning, and I can pass it on to my daughters." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit opens at 1 p.m. on Sunday, and the day's events will include a 
concert by children's musical entertainer Robbo, storytelling and 
face-painting. Tickets are $8 in advance, $10 at the door, and $5 for 
grandparents. 5970 W. Olympic Blvd. (213) 857-0036.

GATES SAYS HE'S CONSIDERING RUN FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates said Friday that he has been strongly 
encouraged to run for lieutenant governor and will weigh the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know for sure," Gates said in response to a question."I was recently 
approached by some very concerned people. I'm seriously trying to sit down to 
consider it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates made the statement after he addressed about 100 members of the South 
Orange County Chamber of Commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 Gates, 54, has been in charge of the Sheriff's Department for nearly two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Political experts have said that several voter surveys already have shown 
Gates as a potential front runner, ahead of candidates who said have announced 
their intentions to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Republicans who intend to seek the nomination include state Sen. Cathie 
Wright of Simi Valley, and Assemblyman Stan Statham of Oak Run. Controller Gray 
Davis, a Democrat, has said he will seek the Democratic nomination for 
lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates must decide by Feb. 9 if he will run or seek reelection as sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days ago, Sonny Bono, former Palm Springs mayor, dropped his plan to 
seek the GOP's nomination for lieutenant governor. Bono reportedly has shifted 
his interest to running for Congress.

NOT ALWAYS A LOVE MATCH; SPORTS CELEBRITIES ARE INCREASINGLY THE TARGETS OF 
NON-SPORTING NUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Athletes are among the most publicly accessible of celebrities -- their job is 
to compete regularly before thousands of screaming fans. It is such 
accessibility that on occasion has made famous performers the open targets of 
people both deranged and violent. 
</P>
<P>
 This vulnerability was evident Thursday in the shocking assault on U.S. figure 
skating champion Nancy Kerrigan in Detroit. Kerrigan, who had just stepped off 
the ice after a practice session, was injured by a man who struck her across 
the legs with what appeared to be a metal rod. As a result she will miss the 
U.S. Figure Skating Championships this weekend and perhaps a chance at an 
Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault is frighteningly reminiscent of an incident last April in which 
Monica Seles, at the time the No. 1-ranked women's tennis player, was stabbed 
in the back by a spectator at a tournament in Germany. It appears that the 
attack on Kerrigan, like that on Seles, was intended to keep the athlete out of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Thursday's incident has again raised the question of whether 
security at sporting venues is adequate. The issue is significant especially in 
the contexts of the coming Winter Olympic Games and the World Cup Soccer 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Several steps could be taken immediately to make athletes at least slightly 
safer: tighter standards for admission to practice sessions, more closed 
sessions, more security guards. But the larger issue of violence in the United 
States and elsewhere cannot be answered with such simple and obvious actions; 
only fundamental changes in society hold the promise of a remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time in the not-so-distant past when fans could literally reach 
out and touch sports heroes, who basked in the adulation. Sadly, the day may be 
nearing when athletes automatically recoil rather than reach for those 
outstretched hands.

THE WEST AND BOSNIA: WHAT NOW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last April the U.N. Security Council voted to establish "safe areas" around 
Muslim enclaves threatened by Serb forces in Bosnia. But according to the 
commander of the U.N. peacekeeping forces, although a minimum of 7,500 troops 
was needed to implement the resolution only 2,000 were ever sent. Belgian Lt. 
Gen. Francis Briquemont resigned in protest last week as Serbian forces outside 
Sarajevo renewed their shelling of the ravaged city. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe's attempt to restore peace to the Balkans has been, in recent months, a 
British-French effort with the British leading the diplomacy and the French 
commanding the troops. Lord David Owen, representing the European Union, has 
served as principal mediator among the warring parties. Gen. Jean Cot is in 
charge of the overall 26,000-member U.N. Protection Force. Within that force, 
Briquemont and before him French Lt. Gen. Philippe Morillon, who was forced out 
for excessive boldness, have commanded the 12,000-member peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
 Their indignation seems to be having a belated and unexpected impact in Paris. 
French Foreign Minister Francois Leotard is reportedly seeking the support of 
the Clinton Administration for a military intervention on behalf of the 
besieged towns of Tuzla and Srebenica. And new calls are being heard for NATO 
air strikes against Serbian mortar positions around Sarajevo -- action that the 
West once promised in the event of a strangulation of the Bosnian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord Owen, meanwhile, has warned the combatants -- above all, the vulnerable 
Bosnians -- that if they do not accept his latest peace plan the U.N. troops 
may withdraw. Owen's view, apparently shared by British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd, is that the Clinton Administration has sabotaged the peace 
process precisely by holding out the vain prospect of such an intervention as 
the French may now propose. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen has said, "If George Bush had won the American elections last year, then 
the war in Bosnia would have been over long ago." Oversimplifying slightly, 
then, the choice between Leotard and Owen is the choice between up and out. But 
what does Bosnia want? 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia, needless to say, would welcome a military rescue. Failing that, 
however, the arms embargo of Bosnia must go. It has been defended on two 
grounds: first, that it would prevent the violence from spreading; second, that 
without this demonstration of neutrality the Serbs might turn on U.N. forces. 
If and when the U.N. peacekeepers withdraw, those arguments, always weak, will 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, they have already collapsed. The violence has already spread. The 
Serbs are already attacking the U.N. forces. Whether or not French President 
Francois Mitterrand proposes military intervention to President Clinton at the 
European summit in Brussels, surely the two can agree that there remains no 
reason why the Bosnians may not arm for their own defense.

LEGALIZING DRUGS AND REDUCING CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Correlating the messages presented in two articles in The Times, Dec. 21 
(View's "Fear Is Starting to Run Our Lives" and Commentary's "How Legalization 
Would Cut Crime," by Steven B. Duke), underscored my long-held belief that 
legalizing some drugs, i.e., marijuana and cocaine, could bring about better 
control of the substances while reducing the crime and violence that have taken 
over our society, just as the legalization of alcohol stemmed the criminal 
dealings created by Prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is so controversial that I doubt that present Administration 
officials dare give credence to thoughts of legalization, but it would be 
courageous of them to follow Surgeon General Dr. Joycelyn Elders' suggestion of 
at least beginning to research the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Legalization doesn't mean no restrictions; I would think the same guidelines 
of acceptability that have been established for beer, wine and hard liquor 
would apply to any use/abuse of a legalized drug. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Duke's commentary reaches conclusions through logic that is confounding to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 While it may be true that the criminalization of drug usage has increased the 
costs of hallucinogens to their users, his conclusion that less expensive drugs 
would decrease the crime rate is illusory. 
</P>
<P>
 If a "druggie" needs a fix, whether it costs $20 or $200, it is probable that 
the money to pay for it will be coming from the sale of someone else's stolen 
property. Let us be realistic; it is unlikely that Duke honestly believes that 
the hard-core drug users are paragons of virtue who are gainfully employed, 
contributing members of our society. 
</P>
<P>
 He states that we "could expect somewhat more use of . . . drugs and . . . 
drug abuse" (if we legalize drugs). Somewhat? Is that like being a little bit 
pregnant? 
</P>
<P>
 How do I teach my children that drug use is unacceptable behavior if society 
condones it? It is already difficult enough discouraging cigarettes and booze 
-- thank goodness that they taste awful the first time you try them. However, 
drugs can have a euphoric effect the first time you use them. If society 
legalizes the use of hallucinogens, then it will have to be prepared to pay the 
consequences: decreased productivity of our work force, deterioration of the 
public's health, babies born dependent on drugs, and more deaths due to driving 
under the influence.

 * Duke states "that drug prohibition is responsible for much of the crime in 
this country is beyond dispute," and he makes reference to "crimes that are 
prohibition-caused." Really? Is he saying that if I commit a drug-related 
crime, it's not my fault? That I am not responsible for my own actions? 
Nonsense! Put the blame for criminal behavior where it belongs -- on the 
criminal.

<P>
 * Of all the syndicated cartoons that you could have selected to feature on 
the Commentary Page for Dec. 26, why the Mike Peters inanity? Comparing one's 
use of a chemical substance with violent crimes against others is perverse and 
dishonest. Worse, I fear that this blatant lack of parallelism may not be 
noticed by the large number of people who have never seriously thought about 
the problem. Because of the simplistic power of cartoons, I can imagine many of 
your readers mindlessly nodding in agreement with this nonsense as if it 
settles the debate. If you selected this cartoon to "balance" the well-reasoned 
essay by Steven Duke, the illogicality of Mike Peters utterly fails to present 
whatever arguments there may be for the "other side" of the drug legalization 
issue.

 I hate to burst his bubble, but I've had doubts for years. While I don't know 
who killed President Kennedy, I have every right to reject the Warren 
Commission's lone assassin theory and will continue to have doubts about it so 
long as evidence surrounding the case continues to be suppressed.

ENDANGERED TIGER AD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am writing to protest the irresponsible and sensationalized advertisement 
in your newspaper (Dec. 27) by the Endangered Species Project of Earth Island 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The photo of a bound tiger shown in the ad was taken at Tainan in 1984. Since 
then, no incident of this kind has taken place in Taiwan due to strict laws 
governing wildlife protection. To publish an obviously outdated picture and to 
mention this rare case misleads your readers about the reality of wildlife 
concerns in Taiwan today. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past several years, the people and the government of the Republic of 
China have done a good job in heightening awareness on the importance of 
protecting endangered species. Importing and exporting tiger products are 
strictly banned by the ROC wildlife conservation laws. Moreover, these laws are 
rigorously enforced. Anyone caught dealing in endangered species faces a stiff 
fine and prison sentence. Taiwan has demonstrated its commitment to endangered 
species protection by publicly incinerating illegal wildlife products. These 
drastic measures are certainly not the actions of a country weak on wildlife 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The ROC on Taiwan is one of the leaders of wildlife protection in Asia. It 
works closely with international conservation groups such as the United Nations 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Last year, 
Jorgan Thomsen of the Trade Records Analysis for Flora and Fauna in Commerce 
(TRAFFIC) even wrote a letter complimenting Taiwan on its efforts in 
controlling the trade of endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger parts have long been considered by the Asian people to have healthful 
medical properties. We think the most effective way to change this cultural 
belief is through education. Therefore, environmental protection has become a 
main subject in our school curriculum. More importantly, most people on Taiwan 
have committed themselves to wildlife conservation for the sake of our future 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, we need to absorb knowledge and experience from conservation 
organizations such as Earth Island Institute. However, a vicious attack on my 
country can only break the hearts of my people, who deserve appreciation for 
their efforts.

MAKING THEM AN OFFER THEY SHOULDN'T REFUSE; WHY EVERYBODY LOVES PACKARD BELL 
ELECTRONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California faces the prospect of losing yet another established, successful 
computer company to some other state. But the determined efforts not only of 
the City of Palmdale but of Los Angeles County and state officials just might 
succeed in persuading Packard Bell Electronics Inc. to stay in the Golden 
State. They say they are pulling out all they stops to show that California can 
be competitive and just as hospitable to business as any other state. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a good show so far. This team effort has produced a package of 
incentives likely to be as attractive as any offered to Packard Bell 
Electronics by Palmdale's chief competitors, Salt Lake City and Portland, Ore. 
The private company has outgrown its Chatsworth facility, where 1,500 people 
are employed. Since March the state Trade and Commerce Agency's Red Team has 
been working to identify other potential sites in California for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan's office was originally involved in trying to keep the 
facility in Los Angeles -- of which Chatsworth is a part -- but it couldn't top 
the offer put on the table by Palmdale, in northeastern Los Angeles County. 
Packard Bell Electronics is expected to pick a site by next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A message for Beny Alagem, chairman, president and chief executive of Packard 
Bell Electronics: Here's why you should keep the nation's fourth-largest 
personal computer maker in California: 
</P>
<P>
 * Most of the Chatsworth plant's 1,500-member work force already lives within 
commuting distance of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 * Palmdale is offering a free site, worth $7.5 million, in its redevelopment 
zone. The area also has been designated as a new foreign trade zone, which 
would entitle Packard Bell Electronics to breaks on duties. The city will also 
issue roughly $10 million in tax-exempt bonds. The proceeds -- enough to build 
a new factory -- would go to your company if you pledge as security for 
repayment the land you got at no cost. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles County on Tuesday granted Packard Bell Electronics $12,500 in 
property tax breaks annually for five years, the maximum allowed under a new 
state law. The county also is offering low-interest construction loans of 
unspecified sums. 
</P>
<P>
 * A tax credit on new equipment is available. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gov. Pete Wilson has personally asked you to stay. We urge the Legislature 
to speed action on a bill to designate Palmdale as an enterprise zone. If that 
happens, Packard Bell Electronics would receive a tax credit of $19,000 over 
five years for every employee hired. The company could also be eligible for 
reduced electricity rates in an enterprise zone. 
</P>
<P>
 This sort of state and local teamwork has paid off before, most recently last 
November when Lego Systems Inc. decided to locate its first U.S. family 
amusement park in Carlsbad, north of San Diego, instead of in Virginia's Prince 
William County. The park, scheduled to open in 1999, should produce $76 million 
annually in sales. Construction will generate a onetime economic bonanza of 
$185 million for the region and create more than 800 jobs. That's no small 
potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping Packard Bell Electronics also would mean new jobs -- about 1,000 to 
1,500 more at the production facility alone, not to mention jobs in 
construction and support services. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal computer business is tough and competitive. California can help 
Packard Bell Electronics meet the challenges of its industry and, at the same 
time, Packard Bell can help California.

2 MEN ARRESTED IN THEFT, EVADING POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men who snatched clothing from a Mervyn's Department Store and then led 
police on a high-speed chase on the San Diego Freeway during rush hour were 
arrested after they rear-ended another car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began about 5:30 p.m. at the Mervyn's at 7777 Edinger Ave., after 
two men grabbed men's clothes, ran to a pickup and got on the freeway at Beach 
Boulevard, said Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Larry Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair headed south, got off the freeway at Brookhurst Street in Fountain 
Valley but made a U-turn and returned to the freeway going north. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the truck got off the freeway at Magnolia Street and struck a car 
at Foxglove Avenue. The driver and passenger then surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Eric Vasquez, 24, of Westminster, and Richard Ray Sandoval, 24, of Lake 
Elsinore were arrested on suspicion of burglary, evading police and drug 
possession, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found $500 in men's clothing and 3 1/2 grams of methamphetamine powder 
packaged in bindles, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were taken to the Huntington Beach Jail, where they were held on 
$10,000 bail each.

said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Bernard Nolan, 25, of Riverside was sentenced to 16 months in state 
prison on four charges of impersonation and three charges of grand theft 
stemming from his claims that he was offensive tackle Darryl Ashmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan, wearing Rams jerseys and an NFL jacket, opened a checking account and 
rented a pager in the name of Ashmore, whom he resembles, according to the 
Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan also frequented nightspots in Orange County, Long Beach and Palm Springs 
where he presented himself as the Rams star to gain the confidence of his 
victims. He stole jewelry from women and took money from men for bogus NFL 
merchandise or promises of game tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The crimes occurred between September, 1992, and February, 1993. The 
investigation began after a victim saw the real Ashmore in a newspaper 
photograph and called the Rams offices. Ashmore was unaware of Nolan's 
activities, authorities said.

FISHERMEN ORDERED TO PULL GILL NETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years after voters approved an initiative outlawing gill nets in 
California waters, commercial fishermen have been ordered to pull the nets from 
the sea, the measure's supporters announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), author of the 1990 ballot measure, said 
a San Diego County Superior Court judge this week rejected pleas by the fishing 
industry for a temporary reprieve from the ban, which went into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen and other backers of Proposition 132 -- which sought to protect sea 
lions and other marine mammals that can get snagged in the nets -- also 
predicted that they will win a legal challenge by gill net fishermen that goes 
to trial April 1 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nets are out of the water, and for that we are very, very happy," Allen 
said at a Capitol news conference. "This is a great day for marine mammals." 
</P>
<P>
 But fishing industry officials said the fight is far from over and said the 
ruling Thursday by Judge Arthur W. Jones does not foretell the outcome of the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see what he said yesterday as having much bearing on what he'll 
decide in two months," said Peter H. Flournoy, attorney for the gill net 
fishermen. "Without question we'll ultimately prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 The fishermen contend that their opponents have overstated the effect of gill 
nets on dolphins, sea lions and whales in an effort to camouflage their true 
aim: to clear the ocean of the commercial fleet so sports anglers have a free 
run of the seas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially what the sportfishermen want is their own playground in Southern 
California without commercial competition," said Diane Plescher, manager of the 
California Seafood Council. In the meantime, she said, consumers will be hurt 
by the ban, which will reduce the amount of fish caught locally by 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill net fishermen are destined for ruin, said Donna Panto of the Los Angeles 
Commercial Fisherman's Assn. Shortly after voters approved the proposition, 
state officials counted about 500 gill net fishermen in California. Today, the 
number stands at a little more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's devastation -- that's absolutely what it means," she said. "Many of 
these people have have dedicated two decades of life into this, and they're out 
of work." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 132 backers note that the measure includes a buyout plan to 
compensate fishermen hurt by the ban. Moreover, they say any effect on the 
seafood market is far outweighed by the positive impact on marine mammals, 
birds and coastal fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although commercial fishermen note that the state's sea lion population has 
increased in recent years, the proposition's supporters contend that many 
species of marine mammals are only just beginning to re-establish themselves 
after severe declines. 
</P>
<P>
 They also argue that the gill nets were stripping shallow coastal waters of 
many species of fish that eventually would have disappeared.

FREEWAY MONORAIL IS BEST TRANSIT OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Transit for the San Fernando Valley has been a contentious issue for nearly 
a decade. In June, 1990, Valley voters favored the freeway monorail by a 5-1 
margin over the more costly subway. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the battle lines are drawn by special interests, not by cost 
and logic. The Ventura Corridor will shape the growth and prosperity of the San 
Fernando Valley and Ventura County for decades to come. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times opinion piece (Dec. 5) expressed a preference for a Ventura Boulevard 
subway. However, the assessment neglects an important consideration: A subway 
through the San Fernando Valley is a system that taxpayers can't afford. 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority research has revealed that the subway 
cost will exceed the monorail cost by more than $1 billion. Along with being a 
more cost-effective transit solution, monorail: 
</P>
<P>
 * Serves millions of passengers annually worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 * Operates in Japan at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Will withstand major earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Has never experienced a passenger fatality. 
</P>
<P>
 * Will be built on existing rights of way without any additional cost to 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoids contact with San Fernando Valley's high water table and methane gas 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Does not require expensive 24-hour ventilation or underground lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Will not require the hauling of 2.2 million cubic yards of earth by 90,000 
truck trips through Valley neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The subway system is swallowing up your transit dollars at a rate of over $330 
million per mile -- a transit system fraught with delays and cost overruns from 
construction to operation. Why would this be preferred by Valley residents? 
</P>
<P>
 Quite simply, a monorail can be built quickly and without the disruption to 
the community that has been experienced by businesses along Wilshire Boulevard, 
where many have been forced into bankruptcy and where the quality of life has 
been severely diminished. This is why the San Fernando Valley voted 
overwhelmingly to support the monorail. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley deserves the very best, environmentally safe transit 
system to unlock congestion and eliminate its pollution. A Ventura Freeway 
monorail will do just that.

SCHOOL BOARD VOTE A BARRIER TO REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Shame on Burbank School Board members Joseph Hooven and Elena Hubbell for 
voting against the John Muir Middle School request for staff development time. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't they read anything about education reform? Reform can't happen without 
teachers' having time to talk to other teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Education's plan, "Second to None," calls for 
schools to provide planning time for teachers. Muir's students would have 
benefited from the creative teaching methods their teachers could have 
developed during those two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't shout school reform and expect it to happen by magic. Effective 
change takes time and planning. Everyone loses when school boards care more 
about the vote than about education.

DEALING WITH THE COYOTE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Just how does Bruce Bialosky (Valley Commentary, Dec. 26) suggest coyotes be 
trapped? Much research by the professionals has already been done on trapping. 
Padded leg hold traps? I think not! They are cruel and do not discriminate 
between coyotes, deer, bobcat, household pet cat, household pet dog or 
household child! 
</P>
<P>
 Shall we also eliminate raccoons and opossums, which have also assimilated 
beautifully to the pressure of the urban development, both north and south of 
Ventura Boulevard? 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners with gardens would dearly love to rid them of rabbit and deer. 
Shall we trap them as well, or would the elimination of Bambi and Thumper make 
the issue unpopular and/or more cruel? How about the homeowners with expensive 
Koi ponds? Shall we kill off the raccoons? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the coyotes were here first! We, much later! Therefore, it is our 
responsibility to protect our privately owned pets as well as our children! 
</P>
<P>
 The solution to this problem may be found in education and the subsequent 
application of what we have learned, not the eradication of a species. 
Cohabitation is most certainly possible. 
</P>

<P>
 * Thank you for Bruce Bialosky's compassionate and comprehensive article. 
</P>
<P>
 As he pointed out, it is sad that a decision which has such a serious impact 
on public safety was made by both the Animal Regulation Commission and the City 
Council based on the number of votes that were (loudly) represented within the 
powerful "humane" community, rather than on a common-sense approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the very knowledgeable and competent people who had effectively 
protected our communities until that time were portrayed as barbarians bent on 
the destruction of these creatures. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 We have created an environment where, unfortunately, wildlife (including our 
friend the coyote) has lost its fear of humans. This is dangerous to both 
people and animals. Coyotes are extremely intelligent and have quickly learned 
that it is much easier to obtain "fast food" in someone's dumpster or yard 
(including their domestic pets) rather than running it down in the brush areas. 
Also, their traditional victims -- deer, rabbits, etc. -- have sensed the 
safety of being closer to the human community and draw their predators into our 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 We need a balanced approach to this problem, and it is no great mystery. The 
county responds to complaints regarding coyote invasion by setting traps and 
monitoring them. The mere presence of these threats to their freedom generally 
causes the coyote to retreat farther back into the wild lands. 
</P>
<P>
 There are parallels between coyotes and domestic dogs and cats. A larger food 
supply creates larger litters. We control this by spaying and neutering our 
personal pets. We have destroyed most of nature's methods of doing so with the 
coyote. 
</P>
<P>
 We are all part of the "humane community." We need to be humane to all living 
things. This can be done by creating a balanced living environment with 
selective trapping to set up parameters that will recondition the coyotes to 
return to a neutral field, naturally reduce breeding and safeguard pets and 
small children (for many of us our pets are our children) who also have a right 
to life.

TOUCHING TRIBUTE TO A SLAIN OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I have been a Los Angeles County deputy sheriff for over 17 years. On Dec. 
7, I attended the funeral of Oxnard Police Officer James O'Brien.It was a sad 
day, the kind I have experienced far too often bidding farewell to other slain 
police officers. The tributes paid to him by his fellow officers showed what a 
great policeman he was and the compassionate and caring father he lived to be. 
</P>
<P>
 But I would also like to salute the caring citizens of Ventura County. All 
along the procession route from the church to the cemetery was something that 
truly touched me. I had never seen anything like it in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred citizens had taken time out of their day to stand at 
intersections and freeway overpasses to salute Officer O'Brien. Some waved the 
American flag, and others held homemade signs acknowledging his contribution to 
the city of Oxnard and the county of Ventura. Caltrans employees and various 
utility company workers stood by with their hands on their hearts as we went 
by. Parents came with their children to wave in support. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers from all over the State of California witnessed this support 
and surely must realize how truly lucky all of Ventura County Law Enforcement 
are to have these citizens. I salute them.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN IN CALABASAS ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * My family and I live in the new Warmington development on Paseo Primario in 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 We moved from Van Nuys to Calabasas three months ago because we were seeking a 
semi-rural, low density environment with a low crime rate. Now it appears that 
the very character and attractiveness of Calabasas is about to be radically 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, twice a day, the overwhelming number of cars that exit Parkway 
Calabasas and Valley Circle contain people who live in the Calabasas area, have 
a financial interest in property in Calabasas, and desire to keep the area in a 
fashion reasonably related to the way it was when they moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Kilroy development presently under consideration is adopted, the 
overwhelming number of cars and respective occupants that exit Parkway 
Calabasas and Valley Circle will not be residents of our community, will not 
have an interest or desire to maintain the integrity of our community. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic will become overburdened, and the increase will not come from 
residents; it will come from a transient population coming in and out of our 
community. Just imagine the traffic flow and density on the freeway ramps and 
on Calabasas road with the multi-screen theater as now desired by the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Of special concern will be the teen-age and young adult transient population. 
Once the movies let out for the evening, especially on weekends, imagine what a 
tempting target the residential community will be for taggers and thieves!  
</P>
<P>
 Are we willing to trade the relative safety and security of our community for 
the slight increase in tax revenue that the proposed Kilroy plan is claiming to 
generate? I think not. The community will already be harmed by the present 
Kilroy plan; why add further insult to existing injury? 
</P>
<P>
 Why does this residential community need to be transformed into an industrial 
park? Are we prepared for even more vacant office space and "For Lease" signs 
posted along Calabasas Road? Haven't we all seen the great number of shops and 
stores in the Valley malls and strip centers going out of business and closing 
up? Calabasas is not immune from such blight. 
</P>
<P>
 We all know that money talks. We all became acutely aware of the loud voice 
money has in political decisions, as evidenced in the recent political 
corruption trials involving (former) state Sens. Alan Robbins and Paul 
Carpenter and lobbyist Clay Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the hope of the vast, vast majority of homeowners in Calabasas that the 
money of the Kilroy development does not speak louder than the voices of the 
concerned residents who oppose this expanded project. 
</P>
<P>
 To the non-resident developer, this expansion is just a way of making more 
money; to us this area is not our home!

PREGNANT DRIVER, FETUS SURVIVE FLIP OF CAR INTO DITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A pregnant woman whose car flipped, hurling her into a freeway drainage ditch, 
suffered a fractured pelvis, broken ribs and arm and major head injuries, but 
she and her fetus survived, highway patrol and hospital officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Maribel Franco, 35, of Santa Ana was driving home from work about 2:30 
a.m. when she apparently fell asleep at the wheel, CHP Officer Rick Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her car ran into the right shoulder of the northbound San Diego Freeway north 
of Westminster Avenue, flipped, slid down an embankment and landed in a 
concrete drainage ditch, Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her injuries, she crawled out of her car and managed to wave at 
oncoming traffic for rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all those injuries, that's pretty incredible," CHP Officer Denise 
Quesada said. 
</P>
<P>
 A tow truck driver saw Franco waving at 6:30 a.m. and stopped to help, Quesada 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster Fire Department then airlifted her to Long Beach Memorial 
Hospital, where she was admitted in critical condition. By Friday afternoon 
Franco's condition was upgraded to fair and doctors believed she and her 
4-month-old fetus would survive, said Lori Brandt, a hospital spokesperson.

MAN GETS MAXIMUM TERM FOR RAPE, STABBING; VIOLENCE: THE 56-YEARS-TO-LIFE 
SENTENCE REFLECTS THE HORRIFYING LEVEL OF VIOLENCE IN THE ANAHEIM ATTACK, A 
PROSECUTOR SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old man received the maximum prison sentence allowable Friday for 
raping a young woman and stabbing her with a kitchen knife in her house, a 
block from his own home in Anaheim.  
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Padilla assaulted the 20-year-old Anaheim woman last July, a 
prosecutor said, after the woman's husband and two housemates had left for work 
in the morning.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard L. Weatherspoon sentenced Padilla 
to 54 years to life in prison for the attack, although Padilla had just one 
prior conviction, for purse-snatching. Padilla could be paroled after 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got the maximum sentence because the level of violence was just so 
horrifying," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jo Escobar. Padilla was convicted of 
attempted murder, robbery, burglary and four violent sex crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla entered the woman's house through a window and confronted her with a 
12-inch knife while she was in bed, Escobar said.  
</P>
<P>
 After removing the woman's jewelry, Escobar said, Padilla made her perform 
oral sex and sodomized and raped her at knifepoint.  
</P>
<P>
 When he had finished assaulting her, Escobar said, Padilla grabbed the woman 
and said: "Let's go." When she asked where, Padilla replied in Spanish, "To 
hell" and plunged the knife into her abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman collapsed to the floor and feigned death, Escobar said. When Padilla 
pressed the knife into her hands, apparently to make her wounds appear 
self-inflicted, he felt a pulse, so he opened one of her eyes and sprayed hair 
spray into it to make her react. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ensuing scuffle, Padilla plunged the knife through the woman's neck and 
fled, Escobar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police identified Padilla because he left fingerprints on a bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Jim Apple, who represented Padilla, said he believes 
Padilla should go to prison. "But I don't believe he deserves to spend the rest 
of his life there," Apple said. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla's older brother, Tony, sadly told the court: "He tried to do his best 
(in life). . . . We're very sorry this happened."

RAIL STATION MOVE CALLED TOO COSTLY; TRANSIT: COUNTY REPORT SAYS MCA'S REQUEST 
TO RELOCATE SITE CLOSER TO CITYWALK COULD INCREASE PROJECT PRICE $41 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County transportation planners said Friday that it would be too 
expensive and time-consuming to grant a request by MCA, the entertainment 
giant, to move the site of a Metro Rail station onto Universal Studios to 
better serve the company's popular CityWalk attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving the subway station onto the studio grounds would increase the 
$420-million construction bill by as much as $41 million and cause a 21-month 
delay, according to the report by the staff of the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheduled July, 2000, station opening would be delayed until April, 2002, 
if the station is relocated from its proposed site on Lankershim Boulevard near 
Ventura Boulevard to a location beneath the Hollywood Freeway near Cahuenga 
Boulevard, according to the MTA report. 
</P>
<P>
 And because the MTA faces a projected $126-million deficit next year, the 
staff report recommended that the relocation plan be rejected unless new 
construction funding is found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the financial shortfall facing the MTA at this time . . . staff 
cannot recommend the diversion of funds from other rail capital and operating 
budgets to fund the relocation of the Universal City station," according to the 
report by David Mieger, MTA project manager for the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary study of the relocation plan released last month estimated that 
it would increase construction costs by $72 million and delay the opening by up 
to three years. Since then, MCA and county transportation officials have worked 
together and with outside consultants to come up with more accurate figures. 
</P>
<P>
 An MTA committee is scheduled to discuss the report Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since August, MCA has been pressing transportation officials to relocate the 
station to better serve patrons of the amusement park. And MCA has hinted that 
if the station is not moved, it will withhold $6 million in property assessment 
fees -- which the company is legally entitled to do. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA officials have insisted that the relocation would not increase the cost of 
the station because the new location would eliminate the need to buy private 
land for station parking. 
</P>
<P>
 They also argued that the new location may increase ridership by 27% -- or 
4,250 riders -- on a typical day, and 78% -- or 12,000 riders -- on peak summer 
days, bringing in more fare money for the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Although MCA representatives still do not agree with the county's new 
estimates, they now agree that the move will increase the station's cost and 
delay the project. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA spokeswoman Christine Hanson said her company's consultants believe the 
move will increase construction costs by about $21 million and delay the 
project by 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, she said MCA still supports the move and is willing to work with 
transportation officials to find new funding sources to make the move 
affordable for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "MCA is planning to work to further close these gaps," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said MCA and county transportation officials agree that the move has its 
benefits, such as the possibility of increasing ridership and eliminating the 
need to buy the homes of about 200 residents to make way for parking space. 
</P>
<P>
 Another advocate of the relocation is Ronni Rice, a representative of about 60 
condominium owners who live near the site of the proposed Lankershim Boulevard 
station and fear the impending construction noise and dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the cost increase and construction delay, Rice said the condo owners 
at Universal Park and Terrace on the Park want the county to continue studying 
the relocation plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people want to see the station relocation because it makes more sense," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But county Supervisor Yvonne Braithwaite Burke, a member of the MTA, said she 
would not support the relocation unless MCA is willing to pay the cost of the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supervisor Burke has always felt that as long as MTA does not have to pay the 
difference, she would be supportive of moving the station," said Mike Bohlke, 
Burke's transportation deputy. "But she doesn't feel the MTA should pay the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Ed Edelman, also an MTA member, said he would like to study the 
relocation idea further before deciding one way or another on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that the MTA doesn't have the money it used to and people in the 
Valley are hungry for transit," he said. "But we also have to decide what makes 
best sense for transit riders."

RELIGION/JOHN DART; BURGEONING CHURCH TO GREET QUAYLE; LANCASTER: THE FORMER 
VICE PRESIDENT WILL SPEAK AT SUNDAY'S DEDICATION OF THE $3.3-MILLION FACILITY. 
THE REV. PAUL CHAPPELL'S BAPTIST CONGREGATION HAS GROWN FROM 13 TO 1,600 IN 
SEVEN YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven years ago, a young Baptist preacher arrived in the Antelope Valley to 
form a congregation, beginning with 13 people who first met in an old building 
in downtown Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 This Sunday, the Rev. Paul Chappell, now 31, and a congregation that averages 
1,600 adults and children in attendance each Sunday, will dedicate a new, 
$3.3-million church facility with former Vice President Dan Quayle as pulpit 
guest speaking on family values. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancaster Baptist Church is probably Antelope Valley's largest Baptist 
congregation, and is among the three or four largest churches of any kind in 
the high desert valley, Chappell said in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor said that he could only speculate why Quayle responded favorably to 
his written invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any political clout," Chappell said. "I'm sympathetic to the 
viewpoints of the religious right on abortion and other social issues, but I'm 
not involved in any coalitions or running off to Sacramento every other week." 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell said that Quayle may have heard about his fast-growing church from 
members or other pastors. "I know he's preached for a few friends of mine" 
around the country, Chappell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several months ago, I wrote him a letter saying he had taken a lot of abuse 
(on defending traditional values), but that I wanted to thank him for being 
faithful to his commitments," he said. "I added, 'By the way, we built a new 
church and would be honored by your presence at the dedication in January.' We 
got a call the following week." 
</P>
<P>
 The church is also sponsoring a Sunday morning community breakfast featuring 
Quayle. "We expect between 300 and 400 people," said Chappell, adding that, 
contrary to an earlier report, not all 400 of the $100 tickets distributed 
through community leaders have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell said he could not discuss the amount of Quayle's honorarium. The 
pastor said he was hoping ticket sales will cover the cost of sponsoring the 
community breakfast. "This is not a fund-raiser for the church," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor said that the breakfast appearance was scheduled to accommodate 
residents who might prefer to hear Quayle speak outside a church service 
setting. But, in addition, services in the new 1,000-seat sanctuary, which 
opened the first week of December, are already packed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were full last Sunday and most of our members have to sit in the overflow 
areas to make room for visitors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mediterranean-style building sits on a 20-acre lot at 4020 E. Lancaster 
Blvd., about four miles east of its former downtown site. The $3.3-million 
cost, nearly half of which is paid off, includes street development expenses 
and $150,000 in city permits, Chappell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's master plan calls for either expanding the present sanctuary's 
seating capacity or building a larger one on the same land, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be another year before expansion plans are outlined. "We want to give 
our members a breather on raising money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chappell received his pastoral training at Pacific Coast Bible 
College in San Dimas, which is aligned with the fundamentalist Baptist Bible 
Fellowship, the pastor and his congregation are independent Baptists 
unaffiliated with any denomination. He had been an assistant pastor at a 
Baptist church in Santa Clara before coming to Lancaster with initial support 
from other independent Baptist churches. 
</P>
<P>
 In accounting for the congregation's rapid growth, Chappell credits 
"Christ-centered" teaching, the receptiveness of many previously "unchurched" 
residents new to the Antelope Valley, generous members and "what we like to see 
as God-honoring faith." 
</P>
<P>
 When in 1988 the church held its first fund-raising banquet for a new church, 
40 families gave a total of $50,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next Monday morning, I drove by what is now our lot and saw a for-sale 
sign that had just gone up that day," Chappell said. The $50,000 was just 
enough for a down payment, he said.

COURTROOM DRAMA; JUSTICE IS UPSTAGED AS 'BEVERLY HILLS, 90210' STEALS SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Department A of Van Nuys Superior Court, a palace of paperwork where civil 
cases are assigned to judges, there usually is little action. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday morning -- cloaked in intense secrecy -- a great drama was 
played out in the court chambers. Was it the verdict in the Menendez brothers' 
murder trial? The sentencing of "Super Freak" singer Rick James on drug and 
sexual-assault charges? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. The television show "Beverly Hills, 90210" was shooting a marriage 
scene, and Dylan, Brenda and company were present as a member of their clique 
tied the knot for an upcoming episode. The show will be the final chapter in 
the season's big mystery: Who got pregnant? 
</P>
<P>
 Extreme attempts to keep that plot twist under wraps abounded. In the hallway 
leading to the courtroom stood a seemingly endless line of security guards. 
Three long, black tarps hung from frames to block the stars from public view. 
And in this, the most public of places, passersby were told they could not 
speak in the hallway during live shots. 
</P>
<P>
 As crew members unloaded equipment outside the courthouse at 7:30 a.m., one 
security guard even followed a Times photographer wherever he went, opening an 
umbrella in front of his camera each time he tried to take a picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, curious attorneys and courtroom clerks gossiped and snooped on 
the proceedings, acting remarkably like the show's (mostly) teen-age fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason Priestley (who plays Brandon Walsh on the show) looks real good," said 
court clerk Ann Papa, wandering around the set with fellow clerk Lisa Chaney 
hoping for an autograph. "He's short though." 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys, however, seemed less than impressed with the cast of the 
popular teen-age soap opera. Several, seeing all the movie trailers outside the 
courthouse, assumed that the Menendez jury had reached a verdict. Others knew 
what was up, but still got it only part right. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're shooting 'Beverly Hills 90275,' " said one man when asked what the 
fuss was all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that helps support the tax base is all right with me," said another. 
</P>
<P>
 Before filming inside presiding Judge Robert M. Letteau's courtroom, crew 
members had made cosmetic changes to make it look more like a real courtroom. 
They placed fake wood paneling athroughout and covered up the clocks with state 
of California seals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said that the pea-green paint reflected badly on the female characters," 
Letteau said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's producers said they would be willing to leave the paneling after 
the shoot, although Letteau figured that might be a fleeting improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks great," he opined, "but I'm afraid it's all going to peel away in 
about a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Letteau arranged for his two daughters, Lara, 23, and Loren, 14, to sit in on 
the shoot along with friend Amy Park, 23. The girls were the only non-crew 
members allowed into the '90210' inner sanctum. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Loren Letteau described the actors as "really friendly," but she 
acknowledged they had not fulfilled their promises -- even to the judge's 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They promised us photographs and then they left," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Erving Hudes was scheduled to settle a case in Letteau's courtroom 
Friday, but he was not annoyed by the change in plans. Letteau, and the case, 
had moved down the hall, and Hudes had a story to tell his 12-year-old 
daughter, Kristine. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just dies for this show," he said. "When she hears that I was on the set 
of '90210,' she'll go gaga." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the security measures, as word of the shoot spread around the 
courthouse, most people agreed that any discriminating '90210' fan will easily 
guess who is getting married. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew right away," said clerk Kim Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 And just who is pregnant? According to court clerks, it's Andrea Zuckerman, 
played by Gabrielle Carteris, who -- big surprise -- is pregnant in real life. 
She's marrying a character called Jesse, whom she met while he was tending bar 
at a birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode is scheduled to run Feb. 9.

TOWER PROTESTERS BLOCK WORKERS, MARSHALS; OJAI VALLEY: A TEMPORARY HUMAN 
BLOCKADE IS SET UP AFTER A JUDGE ALLOWS ACCESS TO THE DISPUTED RADAR STRUCTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ojai Valley protesters blocked federal work crews and U.S. marshals from 
reaching a new mountaintop radar tower for 2 1/2 hours Friday afternoon, 
disbanding only after local law enforcement officers warned of their imminent 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50 residents of the upper Ojai Valley set up the human blockade after a 
federal judge approved the condemnation of a roadway that federal workers need 
to gain access to the National Weather Service's radar tower under construction 
on top of Sulphur Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors opposing the completion of the radar tower, which will emit 
low-level radiation when operational, have tried to halt construction through 
legal challenges to the government's right to use a private roadway to the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 In a countermove to void the challenges, the National Weather Service on 
Friday persuaded a federal judge to allow the government to seize the roadway 
under its powers of condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the ruling, federal workers hauling a 75-ton crane arrived at 
the work site under the escort of 14 officers with the U.S. Marshals Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal crew and escorts were met by 50 irate residents and children, 
holding up signs and blocking their way while booing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find this a little intimidating when the government sends in all these guys 
who are six feet tall and over 200 pounds to make sure they can get into the 
site," said Virginia Loy, a member of the Environmental Coalition of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the marshals' presence, the protesters held their ground, parking 
their cars along the narrow roadway and standing in the way of the trucks. An 
official with the U.S. Marshals Service said as long as the protesters stayed 
off federal property they were out of federal jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not here to cause any problems," said Charlie Almanza, chief deputy in 
charge of the contingent from the U.S. Marshals Service. "The government now 
owns the driveway and we're here to make sure the people allow us to get the 
truck through." 
</P>
<P>
 Almanza said the federal officers were dispatched immediately after the court 
decision to allow federal seizure of the access roadway owned by Agnes Baron. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so cold that they can do that to an 86-year-old lady," said Kenny 
Fuller, whose property abuts the radar site. "Just take her property when they 
see fit."  
</P>
<P>
 Fuller and other neighbors of the weather radar tracking station stood in the 
road and waited for the marshals to take action. One protester yelled, "How 
would you like this in your back yard?" Others tried to hand the federal 
officials literature detailing protesters' complaints over the tower, which 
they believe emits potentially harmful levels of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 At dusk, seven Ventura County sheriff's deputies arrived, followed by three 
others from the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters disbursed when the deputies and CHP officers, who have 
jurisdiction on local land, told those in the blockade to end their civil 
disobedience or risk arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's heartbreaking," said Patti Givner, whose husband, Dale, is the attorney 
who spent Friday morning trying to stop the government action. "I thought we 
had rights and that the government would never do anything like this. I don't 
understand how they can do this to their own citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers representing the neighbors opposed to the radar tower said the 
government was trying to complete the project before the local residents could 
file another lawsuit to halt construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing the Environmental Coalition of Ojai, actor Larry Hagman 
and other upper Ojai Valley residents said one federal lawsuit is scheduled to 
go to court Monday. The suit is challenging the project on the grounds that the 
government failed to do the proper environmental reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to get it operational because they think once it get operational 
the protests will diminish," said Fred Blum, a San Francisco-based attorney 
representing the coalition. "It's typical government overkill and its typical 
of their behavior on this project." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Givner said Blum's lawsuit was a second chance for the protesters to stop 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't lost," he said as the protesters made way for the crane to pass to 
the construction site. "We'll be back to fight another day."

WILSON'S FEE HIKE PLAN FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ATTACKED; EDUCATION: VENTURA 
COUNTY STUDENTS SAY COSTS WILL BE PROHIBITIVE. OFFICIALS FEAR DROP IN 
ENROLLMENTS AND LOSS OF FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A proposal by Gov. Pete Wilson to hike community college fees by $7 per unit 
could force many financially strapped Ventura County students to postpone or 
even cancel their dreams of higher education, local community college students 
and district officials said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 "For some students who are barely making it out there, this could be it," said 
Ramiro Hernandez, 22, a television production student at Oxnard College, who 
himself gets by on a state grant. "I could only manage it through receiving 
more financial aid, but I don't know how much money (the state) has left."  
</P>
<P>
 The fee increase is part of Wilson's $55.4-billion spending plan for the next 
fiscal year, which he announced at a news conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor proposed raising community college fees from $13 to $20 per unit, 
a change that could go into effect by the fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials raised student fees last spring from $6 to $10 per unit for 
students without bachelor's degrees and $50 per unit for students with 
bachelor's degrees. The fees were increased again last fall from $10 to $13 per 
unit for students without bachelor's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 After the most recent fee hike, enrollment dropped by an average of 12% at the 
Ventura County Community College District's campuses in Moorpark, Oxnard and 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 District board President Allan Jacobs predicted another drop of up to 10% next 
fall if the state levies the higher fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is very short-sighted on Wilson's part," Jacobs said. "I think, 
ultimately, you are doing damage to the economy. Students who need to get 
retrained will not be getting the education they need because of the 
(prohibitive) fees." 
</P>
<P>
 District trustee Timothy Hirschberg said he hopes the trustees will band 
together to oppose the fee hike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really distressed," Hirschberg said. "It's not in the interest of the 
colleges or the communities they serve, and it's not in the interest of 
California to shut the door in the face of people trying to get their foot in 
the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, alarmed by the colleges' plunging enrollment, district officials 
launched a countywide advertising campaign to attract students back to the 
campuses, replete with shiny buttons and brightly colored posters. College 
officials are particularly concerned about maintaining enrollment, because if 
the figures drop below those set by the state for full funding, the district 
could lose money. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Jan. 6, 1994, pre-enrollments for the spring semester had dropped only 
1.5% from what they had been on Jan. 6, 1993, said district Chancellor Thomas 
Lakin. Registration officially begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the relatively small decline in pre-enrollments, the district 
could lose up to $5 million from its $63-million budget if this spring 
semester's enrollment fails to surpass last year's, Lakin said. Further 
enrollment loss next fall could cost the district another $2 million to $3 
million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's proposed fee hike would make up more than one-third of a proposed 
3.4% budget increase that Wilson would award the community colleges under his 
budget for 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local district trustees, however, scoffed at the proposed increase, 
saying that extra funds from the state always seem to be targeted at specific 
programs that do little or nothing to ease the district's economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Wilson's going to give us extra money, it's going to be categorical," 
Hirschberg said. "When they give us extra money, they always tell us how to 
spend it." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, though, nothing is set in stone -- or law -- and district 
officials and students vowed to fight the fee increases all the way to the 
Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenn Woodward, 46, a history student at Ventura College, said he hopes the 
threat of a fee hike will propel angry students into organized, campus 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will have to work more, which means I have to cut back on study hours to 
afford to go to school," said Woodward, who works about 20 to 30 hours a week 
as a cabinetmaker. "In a sense, they're cutting into my education because 
they're making my education more difficult to obtain."

PROPOSED HEALTH SHIFT STIRS CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling Gov. Pete Wilson's $55.4-billion budget proposal a "complicated 
scheme," Ventura County officials said Friday they are skeptical of the 
governor's plan to shift $5.4 billion in health and welfare programs from the 
state to local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wilson's proposal would give local government more control over mental 
health, welfare and other health and social programs, county officials said the 
governor's spending plan could leave the county without adequate funds to cover 
the program costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we are able to have some kind of guaranteed revenue, everything is up 
in the air," Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg: "The concept of giving 
more local control is very sensible. But we could be left with a very serious 
problem in funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Wilson's plan, health and social programs would become a 
"revenue-neutral transaction," accomplished by shifting sales and property tax 
funds from the state to the counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Local governments would receive the revenue from a half-penny of the current 
statewide sales tax, worth about $1.5 billion annually, plus money from the 
Vehicle License Fee fund, about $740 million. They also would receive some 
additional property tax money. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wittenberg said he is concerned that the caseload of people receiving 
health and social services would increase at a faster rate than the revenue 
sources -- leaving the county scrambling to come up with funds to pay for the 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has the possibility of short-funding us," Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon said he was also skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened in the past, when they transferred programs to us, is that 
we have never gotten enough money to take care of the additional costs," Mahon 
said. "I'm not really optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor John K. Flynn said the county should give Wilson's plan a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the governor's proposal is outstanding," Flynn said. "The governor 
sounds like he is trying to reduce the massive state bureaucracy. That's what 
the local people said they've wanted for years. Anyone who is nay saying this 
is not being true to principle." 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Bohannon, the county's legislative lobbyist, said she hopes to make it 
clear to legislators that Ventura County cannot take over health and welfare 
programs without sufficient funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It behooves us all to give it a chance and try to make it work," Bohannon 
said. "The end result should be better service to clients, the better use of 
tax dollars and a diminishing of the state bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they were pleased that Wilson's budget did not again 
propose sharp cuts in local funding. Last year, Wilson's budget moved $2.6 
billion from cities and counties to public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that the governor has recognized he cannot continue to take from 
cities to make up for state shortfalls," said Lin Koester, Simi Valley's city 
manager. "We don't intend on letting our guard down. We'll be watching closely 
over the next few months as it (the budget proposal) works its way through the 
legislative process." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton called the budget "a great start." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than the way we started last year," Stratton said. "Most of us 
will be happy just to be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thousand Oaks officials were less optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I'm not impressed with many of the initiatives that have come from 
the state," Thousand Oaks Mayor Elois Zeanah said. "I can understand residents' 
concerns about government in general, and how we're spending taxpayer money. 
The answer is to have a more efficient government." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Alex Fiore scoffed at Wilson's claim that counties 
would be able to fund their new responsibilities with the half-cent sales tax 
and vehicle licensing fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an impossible situation," said Fiore, a 30-year veteran on the 
Thousand Oaks council. "The governor seems to think the half-cent sales tax is 
some kind of a windfall, but I don't believe that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the burden for funding health and social services will fall 
on counties, Fiore predicted that cities also would soon feel the effects of 
California's cash crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always manages to get down to the cities," Fiore said. "We've lost money 
since the state budget crisis hit, and yet the cities have caused none of it."

RESTAURATEURS ASK CITY TO SNUFF OUT BAN ON SMOKING; VENTURA: THE GROUP SEEKS 
RECONSIDERATION OF THE COUNCIL'S PRELIMINARY APPROVAL. A FINAL VOTE IS 
SCHEDULED MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A group of restaurateurs are urging some Ventura City Council members to drop 
a smoking ban that received the council's preliminary approval last month but 
comes up for a final vote on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurateurs have been calling on some council members, asking them to 
reconsider their decision to outlaw smoking in all restaurants and businesses, 
with the exception of bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan tentatively adopted by the council Dec. 21, restaurants that 
have bar areas can allow smoking at the bar only if the bar is walled off from 
the restaurant and has a separate ventilation system. Patrons seated in patios 
or other outdoor tables would be permitted to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurateurs oppose the ban, saying it would drive off customers and would be 
too costly to add the required walls and ventilation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't afford to make those kind of changes," said Michael Wagner, owner of 
Andria's Seafood restaurant at Ventura Harbor. Wagner said about 40% of his 
customers smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsmoking advocates said they would be upset if the council backed away from 
its preliminary approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should pass the law," said Dr. Theodore Hostetler, a pulmonary 
physician who spoke in favor of the ban last month. "It would be breaking a 
pledge to the community for a few." 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurateurs have been circulating petitions against the smoking ban, and 
some have written letters to local newspapers objecting to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, a group of about 10 restaurateurs met with Mayor Tom Buford 
and Councilman Greg Carson to press their case. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford, an ex-smoker, said he has not changed his mind about the ban. But 
Carson said he was swayed by some of the restaurateurs' arguments and may 
attempt to modify the ban Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be a costly endeavor for businesses," Carson said. "They could 
build a wall and do everything that's asked of them, but what's to say that 
another council won't come in two years later and ban smoking entirely?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 2 last month to adopt the ordinance, which would 
restrict smoking in virtually all businesses and restaurants, but allow it in 
outdoor seating areas. Councilmen Jim Monahan and Jack Tingstrom -- staunch 
pro-business supporters -- dissented, saying the law would be hard to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members said they are more concerned about the hazards of 
secondhand smoke and have not heard any arguments from restaurateurs persuasive 
enough to swing their support to a less restrictive ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a public health issue," Councilman Gary Tuttle said. "How can you change 
your mind on public health?" 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steve Bennett, who supported the ban, said he has received a few 
letters from residents opposed to the smoking ban, but has not changed his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm willing to listen to what they have to say Monday night," Bennett said. 
"I haven't finished listening." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be considered unusual if council members Monday backed away from 
their previous decision, city staff said. The final vote on any ordinance is 
usually a formality and attracts little comment from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ban was discussed last month, however, two restaurateurs showed up to 
speak against it. They were outnumbered by about a dozen nurses, physicians and 
other anti-smoking advocates who spoke in favor of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the busiest two weeks in the restaurant business," said Brian 
Brennan, manager of the Chart House. "People celebrate a lot during the 
holidays and they go out. We heard about it at the last moment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan, who spoke against the ban when it was tentatively approved, said 
whether to ban smoking should be left to restaurateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an encroachment into business," Brennan said. "Don't we have the option 
to decide what happens within our four walls?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some restaurateurs said they favor the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Smith, owner of Rosarito Beach Cafe, said his waiters and waitresses are 
concerned about secondhand smoke, and patrons are required to light up in the 
outdoor seating area. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Ponce, who owns the Ventura Spaghetti Company, said if he is required to 
declare his entire restaurant nonsmoking, he doubts he would run into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel that many people would come in and insist on smoking," said 
Ponce, a smoker himself. "I don't see what all the fuss is about." 
</P>
<P>
 If the ban is given final approval Monday, it would be effective in April.

BACK-TO-BASICS SCHOOL PROPOSED FOR VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to answer some conservative critics of public education, the Ventura 
schools' chief is proposing a back-to-basics school with a strict dress code, 
mandatory homework and required volunteer work by parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Unified School District Supt. Joseph Spirito will ask the school board 
Tuesday to convert one of the district's 17 elementary schools to a stricter, 
no-frills educational setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who send their children to the school would have to sign a contract 
agreeing to volunteer at the site at least three hours per week and to ensure 
that their students spend a certain amount of time every day doing homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Children at the back-to-basics school would also have to abide by a strict 
dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 "No shorts, no sandals, no halters, no tank tops, no boys wearing earrings," 
Spirito said. And no jeans or T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls would wear dresses or long pants, while boys' attire would be restricted 
to collared shirts and slacks. Even teachers would be asked to limit their work 
wardrobe voluntarily to dresses for women instructors and ties and jackets for 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees said they support the superintendent's proposal. But Trustee Diane 
Harriman added that she would not have wanted to work at such a school when she 
was a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would find this kind of atmosphere too restrictive for me," said Harriman, 
who taught English for 30 years at Balboa Middle School and Buena High School. 
"But it may be just what a lot of parents would like." 
</P>
<P>
 The school would be only the third back-to-basics institution in Ventura 
County. Simi Valley already has established such a program at Vista and Hollow 
Hills fundamental schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Spirito got the idea for the back-to-basics school during last fall's campaign 
against the Proposition 174 school voucher initiative, when he listened to its 
supporters' complaints about the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of voucher supporters, public schools need to become safer, 
stricter and more focused on teaching reading, writing and arithmetic, Spirito 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents also want choice, he said, echoing a key theme of the pro-voucher 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The back-to-basics school would answer all these concerns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board gives its support to the proposal Tuesday, Spirito said, the next 
step would be to choose a principal and a school site. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the district will not pay to bus students to the school, Spirito said 
he hopes to find a centrally located school that is accessible to families from 
around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is seeking a school where most of the parents with children already 
there would agree to the volunteering requirement and to the more structured 
educational setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a site is chosen, parents at that school who don't agree with the 
stricter standards can have their children bused to the next nearest school at 
district expense, he said. Teachers will also have the option to switch out of 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Spirito said he envisions opening the back-to-basics school in the fall or in 
1995 at the latest, with 300 to 400 students and 30 to 40 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one elementary school may ask that it be chosen for the 
back-to-basics experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Atmore, principal of Montalvo School, said she and her teachers have 
begun discussing the proposal and will soon broach the idea to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Montalvo already emphasizes teaching the basics of reading, writing and 
arithmetic, she said, but it may be difficult for students at the 
kindergarten-through-fifth-grade school to adjust to Spirito's dress code, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the things may be too restrictive for my community," she said. "My 
boys wear Levi's." 
</P>
<P>
 But one parent who said she would consider sending her child to the new school 
said she is particularly excited about the proposed dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrie Torres, a legal secretary, said her 13-year-old daughter is in the 
program for gifted students at Balboa Middle School, where she is doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 But she would consider sending her 8-year-old son, now at a private Baptist 
school, to the back-to-basics institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at schools without strict dress codes put too much energy into 
planning their outfits and noticing what their classmates are wearing, Torres 
said. "It takes away from what they're supposed to be learning."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; STREET NAME CHANGE WOULD HONOR BISHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The street was Bishop Benjamin Crouch's first pulpit. Those who remember him 
think it only fitting that a street should be his memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioners of the Christ Memorial Church of God in Christ are starting a 
campaign to rename a 1.5-mile section of Vaughn Street from Foothill Boulevard 
to San Fernando Road after their congregation's founder, who died Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch started the congregation in 1951 and for more than 40 years was 
considered an important local leader in the African American community, with 
national recognition as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Congregation members hope to gather thousands of signatures, and have been 
circulating petitions among local congregations, through the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People and hand to hand, said Sandra Crouch, 
daughter of Bishop Crouch and a Grammy-award-winning gospel singer with her 
twin brother, Andrae. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement has gained popularity quickly, largely because of Crouch's 
reputation as someone who was at home on the streets where he started his 
career, said Andrae Crouch. 
</P>
<P>
 "He actually preached on the streets," he said. "We would go out with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch also was known for his leadership abilities during tumultuous times 
such as the civil rights movement, the Watts riots and Rodney G. King beating. 
Last month, another congregation dubbed his father "The Rock of the Valley" 
during a service in his honor, Crouch said. To others, especially those who 
lacked a father, he was simply "Papa Crouch," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "He touched the lives of a lot of people," said the Rev. Arthur Broadous, 
program director of the Pacoima Community Youth Culture Center. "It's a legacy 
to where he started." 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch began his career in Val Verde, preaching to convicts, drug addicts and 
the ill, as well as broadcasting on radio and television. He started the Christ 
Memorial Church in the garages of area residents. Gradually, he gathered a 
congregation and in the 1960s built a church at Vaughn Street near Glenoaks 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing Vaughn Street's name may not be an easy task. The City Council has to 
make the change, and can do so on its own or in response to petitions from 
property owners only, according to city codes. Owners who are against the 
change can petition in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadous said he was unsure how many signatures have been gathered. He and 
other organizers will be visiting property owners along Vaughn Street to enlist 
their support, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody that we've talked to so far is in support of it," Broadous said. 
"We haven't heard a negative voice, so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadous said he will present the petitions to Councilman Richard Alarcon, 
whose district includes that section of Vaughn Street, and who chairs the 
Public Works Committee of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon could not be contacted for comment Friday. GEOFFREY MOHAN

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MATH WHIZ DRAWS POSTER FOR SCIENCE FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talented at math, 17-year-old Todd River had planned to go into computer-aided 
design until last year, when he took his first art class and discovered how 
much he liked freehand drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the Channel Islands High School senior won a poster contest for this 
year's Ventura County Science Fair, beating out students from around the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning the contest was exciting, Todd said, but he doesn't need special 
honors to get satisfaction from his art. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm done with a piece and I like it a lot and other people like it, I'm 
just real happy with myself," he said. "I just see something I want to draw and 
I try to make it as realistic as I can. I'm a perfectionist." 
</P>
<P>
 Prints of Todd's winning entry will be used around the county to advertise the 
fair, which will be held April 19 to 21 at the Ventura County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the nonprofit Ventura County Economic Development Assn. and the 
Ventura County superintendent of schools office, the annual event is open to 
students in the sixth through 12th grades from both public and private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to awarding first place to Todd's poster, organizers gave second 
place to Brian Kay, a seventh-grade student at Colina Intermediate School in 
Thousand Oaks. Third place went to Emma Nieva, who is in the 11th grade with 
Todd at Channel Islands High. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd said the hardest part of designing his poster was choosing what to draw. 
Knowing that the purpose of the poster is to encourage students to enter the 
fair, Todd decided to use objects to represent various fields of science, such 
as a leaf to signify botany and a picture of the Earth for environmental 
science. For zoology, he drew a monkey and a lizard. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came to physics, Todd chose a person: Albert Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of physics," Todd said, "I think of him." MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; FIELD OF POLICE CHIEF CANDIDATES CUT TO 
4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A special search panel interviewed 10 candidates Friday for the job of Simi 
Valley police chief, narrowing the field to four men who will be considered to 
replace Chief Lindsey Paul Miller when he retires Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell declined to identify any of the candidates, 
saying only that they included people from inside and outside the 109-officer 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Each candidate underwent 40-minute interviews by a panel made up of a police 
chief and city manager from outside Simi Valley, a schools official, and a 
representative of the city's business community, Sedell said. The panelists' 
identities are being kept secret so they cannot be pressured by city residents 
or anyone else with an interest in the outcome, Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police union President Sgt. Gary Collins was allowed to sit in on the 
interviews as an observer and will offer concerns and recommendations next week 
to City Manager Lin Koester, Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four finalists chosen Friday will be notified Monday that they are to 
return for another round of interviews, Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koester, Mayor Greg Stratton and Mayor Pro Tem Judy Mikels plan to interview 
the four Friday, and Koester will make the final decision on who becomes the 
new chief, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of those 10 that were interviewed today had very strong command 
experience as sworn law enforcement officers," Sedell said. "And we believe 
that the four the oral board have referred for further interviews are truly 
well-qualified candidates for the position of police chief." 
</P>
<P>
 The city first advertised the post in November, shortly after Miller announced 
he would be ending his 32-year police career, which included 12 years as Simi 
Valley chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager's office received 51 applications for the job, Sedell said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PROGRAM TO HELP RESIDENTS FIND JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welfare recipients, former drug abusers and people who have been without a job 
for over a year can get help finding work through a new federal job-training 
program, officials said this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The program is designed to aid Ventura County residents who are at least 22 
years old and have multiple barriers to employment, said Aram Saroyan, 
spokesman for the Job Training Policy Council of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who may qualify is encouraged to apply, Saroyan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although funded with federal dollars through the Job Training Policy Council, 
the employment program will be run by CALTAC, an Oxnard job training and 
placement firm. 
</P>
<P>
 CALTAC will hold workshops three times a week to teach participants ways to 
land a job, including preparing resumes, filling out applications and 
succeeding at job interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Job searchers can also use CALTAC's office to create resumes on a computer, 
phone potential employers and fax other information, Saroyan said. The program 
will also reimburse an employer for up to half of a participant's salary for a 
six-week training period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Job Training Policy Council is a federally funded, nonprofit organization 
that provides employers in the county with a trained work force, Saroyan said. 
It will oversee $7 million in job training funds in Ventura County this year. 
</P>

 A panel of government officials will be available to answer questions about 
maintenance and security for the proposed 15-acre lake in the Hansen Dam 
Recreation Area at a community meeting Monday evening sponsored by the Lake 
View Terrace Improvement Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the city Recreation and Parks Department and the Army Corps of 
Engineers are expected to attend, in addition to Los Angeles City Councilman 
Richard Alarcon and representatives of Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and Congressman Howard Berman (D-Panorama 
City). 
</P>
<P>
 Groundbreaking for the new lake in the west end of the recreation area is 
expected in June, said Rose Castaneda, administrative assistant for Berman. The 
federal government has approved more than $5 million to improve the Hansen Dam 
property, which is owned by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want something really nice and we want them to tell us how they will do 
it," said Eileen Barry, board member of the Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The community meeting is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at the Lake View Terrace 
Recreation Center at 11075 Foothill Blvd., Lake View Terrace. STEPHANIE STASSEL

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; COUNCIL MAY HEAR LANDFILL GAS PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan that would allow a private partnership to siphon off methane gas from 
the Lopez Canyon Landfill could be ready to go to the City Council this month, 
according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed methane-energy plant was approved by the Los Angeles Board of 
Public Works last September, and sent to the city administrative office for 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The methane, a byproduct of decaying trash, is percolating through the soil of 
the dump, which is slated to close in 1996. The malodorous gas, long the bane 
of area residents, is being collected and burned off. Lopez Canyon Energy 
Partners hopes to harness that wasted energy to generate electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city administrative office's approval of a lease agreement with the 
city had to be put on a back burner because the office is tied up preparing the 
city's overall budget, said Richard Hart, principal administrative analyst for 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the budget, to be honest, it's not on the top of my priorities," said 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the partnership changed some elements of the proposal, including 
its proposed lifetime and some of the equipment, said Hart. The project will 
extend over 30 years, instead of 20, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The equipment changes, prompted by the Air Quality Management District, are 
aimed at improving the efficiency of the plant, said Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 The city administrative office wants to be sure the project can be viable and 
profitable because the city will buy energy from the plant, as well as collect 
royalties from other energy sales, said Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 A city Bureau of Sanitation official said the nearly four-month lag in getting 
the proposal before council seemed unusual, but predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering this is budget time and they're putting the budget together, I 
can understand it," said Mike Miller, assistant director of the bureau's Solid 
Waste Department. GEOFFREY MOHAN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; HOOVER HIGH BINGO PROPOSAL CALLED OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All bets are off on a booster club's proposal to hold bingo games as a way to 
raise money for Hoover High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents in the Purple Circle Booster Club backed away from the idea after 
failing to gain support from the Glendale Board of Education earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Boosters for Hoover High had hoped board members would consider establishing a 
policy to allow bingo as a fund-raising activity in the Glendale Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 But during its Tuesday night meeting, the board voiced strong opposition to 
bingo. No votes were required because the issue was presented only for 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed that there were no open minds for trying something new, 
of giving (bingo) a chance," said Ellen Walley, secretary for the Purple Circle 
Booster Club. "We've got to find new ways to find money for the schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the board members equated bingo with gambling and felt boosters should 
use other creative methods to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just philosophically opposed to it," said board President Jane M. 
Whitaker, who also doesn't favor the state lottery system.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is not my concept of a way for money to be raised for students. I don't 
like the message it sends," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Lynda Rocamora said she empathized with the fund-raising 
difficulties of nonprofit groups during a slumping economy and would be more 
open to the boosters' proposal if bingo games were held off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocamora, whose daughter attends Hoover High, was also concerned that such 
events are known to attract smokers. The district has a no-smoking policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents at Hoover High supported bingo games, which are allowed as 
fund-raisers in nearby school districts in Burbank, South Pasadena and Temple 
City. TOMMY LI

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; TRIAL IS REQUESTED IN GADFLY-SHOVING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Both sides are now bracing for a trial in the lawsuit against a Burbank school 
board member who allegedly shoved a notorious gadfly into a door at a meeting 
more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank lawyer David Romley, representing self-described "Gadfly from Hell," 
Melvin Perlitsh, said he filed a request this week with Glendale Superior Court 
Judge Charles Stoll for a trial in the suit against William S. Abbey, vice 
president of the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 A court-appointed arbitrator last month ruled in favor of Perlitsh, saying he 
was owed $1,800, which Romley said was about what the medical costs were from 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that would be enough money to settle it," said Romley, who in 
rejecting the arbitrator's decision is seeking $45,000 in punitive damages 
against Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
 In the October, 1992, incident at a school board meeting, Perlitsh and Abbey 
got into an argument during which Abbey is alleged to have shoved Perlitsh into 
a door as they were leaving the room. Perlitsh's arm was injured, which Romley 
said had just recently been operated on. The suit was filed in February. ED

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OKLAHOMA MAN TO HEAD AIDS CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AIDS Care, a nonprofit agency that offers support services to Ventura County 
residents with AIDS and HIV, has hired an Oklahoma man as its new executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifton Justice, a theatrical director and fine arts administrator, will take 
charge of the agency Jan. 17 under a one-year contract, said Janiece Bulgin, 
president of AIDS Care's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgin, who said Justice was chosen because of his fund-raising abilities and 
experience in developing community support for the groups he has headed, said 
she hoped Justice will stay with AIDS Care for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping that this will be a long-term affair," Bulgin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice will succeed Edie Brown, whose resignation became effective at the end 
of the year. Brown stepped down from the executive director's post because of 
her perception that the agency, which last year had a $300,000 budget, needs a 
director who is more effective at fund raising, Bulgin said. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS Care, which was founded in 1988, is an advocate for AIDS and HIV clients 
and provides education to the community. "AIDS Care is kind of a misnomer," 
Bulgin said. "We're not a hospital. We have caseworkers who provide client 
services, operate support groups and a food bank, refer people to confidential 
testing and to medical, legal and dental services." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice, 38, recently moved to Southern California from Tulsa, Okla., where he 
founded and worked with arts-related nonprofit groups, including the Actors 
Theatre of Tulsa and the Fort Smith Symphony in Fort Smith, Ark. He said he 
raised $1 million during the past 10 years on behalf of the groups he has 
directed. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice said he has worked as an AIDS volunteer in the past and has had 
friends affected by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "AIDS Care is an organization I can get very excited about," Justice said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LOS PADRES FOREST; 9 CONDORS IN WILD STAY CLOSE TO ROOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All nine California condors in the wild are staying close to the remote Santa 
Barbara County cliff where they were released last month, avoiding the hazards 
of civilization that killed four of their cousins in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Four older birds in the group that were transferred to the Lion Canyon site 
from the Sespe Condor Sanctuary in Ventura County have not ventured farther 
than a mile from the new roost, said Marc M. Weitzel, project leader for the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife's Condor Recovery Program. 
</P>
<P>
 And the five younger birds have not flown farther than half a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists had feared that the older birds would take off by themselves or 
eventually lead the younger birds on a trek back to their old home in the Sespe 
sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, the strategy is working," Weitzel said. "They are all roosting as a 
unit. The older birds have flown off for a while, but they come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzel said biologists are feeding the condors calf carcasses near the 
release site to encourage them to stay close. The older birds may also stay 
close because of the presence of the younger birds, who cannot yet fly long 
distances, Weitzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only time will tell" whether they will stay close, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five young birds that had never before flown in the wild and one of the Sespe 
birds were released in Lion Canyon on Dec. 7. To prevent the older birds from 
forming a group and heading home to the Sespe, releases of the other three were 
staggered over the next three weeks. The last bird was released Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists chose the remote Lion Canyon area in Los Padres National Forest in 
hopes that the birds will stay away from civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two were released into the wild in January, 1991, at the Sespe 
Condor Sanctuary. In December, 1992, six more birds were released. 
</P>
<P>
 Between October, 1992, and November, 1993, four of the birds had been killed 
through collisions with power lines or poles or by poisoning from antifreeze. 
</P>
<P>
 The release effort is the key to a $15-million plan to bring the giant 
vultures back from the brink of extinction. The next group of zoo-bred birds is 
scheduled to be released in December.JOANNA M. MILLER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: GTE TO LAY OFF 19 AREA WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GTE California said Friday it will lay off 514 workers -- including 19 in 
Ventura County -- in response to increasing competition, technological 
advancements and the sluggish state economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19 local workers facing layoffs involve one supervisor, five cable 
splicers, one mechanic and three frame maintainers in Thousand Oaks; five cable 
splicers, one frame maintainer, and one mechanic in Oxnard, and one clerk and 
one frame maintainer in Camarillo, a company official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable splicers fuse the loose ends of cables, and frame maintainers complete 
service orders, said Daniel Smith, a spokesman at GTE California headquarters 
in Thousand Oaks. The majority of laid-off employees are cable splicers and 
frame maintainers, whose jobs the company has been able to perform with 
advanced technology at less expense, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the layoffs is increased competition in the local telephone 
market, Smith said. GTE California provides local and regional long-distance 
service and data communications to 3.1 million customers in 330 communities, 
mostly in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The recessionary economy has also hurt the company, cutting in half its phone 
business growth rate since the late 1980s, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE said it would provide job-transfer opportunities where possible. Affected 
employees who do not find another job with GTE will receive pink slips March 7, 
along with severance pay packages and job-search assistance, Smith said.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: VALLEYWIDE; MORE RESIDENTS HELP POLICE FIGHT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of San Fernando Valley neighborhoods working with police to fight 
crime nearly doubled in 1993, according to figures released Friday by the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's pillar of community-based policing -- the Neighborhood Watch 
program -- increased the number of neighborhood block captains in the Valley 
from 1,674 to 3,330 between January and December of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased," said Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy, who praised former 
Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker, his predecessor, for the increase. "I think it 
shows a tremendous dedication to improve the quality of life in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 In community-based policing, block captains organize Neighborhood Watch 
meetings among neighbors. They then take information on criminal activity from 
these meetings to a police community representative, or PCR. 
</P>
<P>
 This person then presents these concerns to the local police station's senior 
lead officer, who meets with his captain to plan strategy to eliminate the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "In conjunction with this increase in Neighborhood Watch programs and the 
activities of officers in the Valley, we've had an overall 6.3% decrease in 
repressible crime in the Valley," said Polic Lt. Joseph Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said "repressible crimes" include robbery, burglary, theft from a motor 
vehicle and grand theft auto. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest increase among all five Valley police divisions occurred in Van 
Nuys, where the number of block captains tripled from 250 at the beginning of 
the year to 762. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the credit was given to Senior Lead Officer Joe Losorelli, who became 
the first Valley officer to organize Neighborhood Watch captains for all the 
blocks in his area. 
</P>
<P>
 "He set a high standard for the rest of the senior lead officers to follow," 
said Pomeroy. 
</P>
<P>
 All other Valley divisions reported increases in block captains in 1993. 
Devonshire jumped from 350 to 804; Foothill increased from 333 to 403; North 
Hollywood rose from 316 to 366, and West Valley had the most block captains in 
the Valley, climbing from 425 to 992. JEFF SCHNAUFER

 It's being billed as a super bowl of another sort. 
</P>
<P>
 Couch potatoes are expected to turn out en masse for the first National 
Football League Air-It-Out flag football tournament at Pierce College this 
weekend. About 25,000 people are expected to attend the two-day competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Flag football is a variation of professional football played with modified 
rules. Instead of tackling opponents, players try to pull one of two flags 
attached to a belt worn by each player. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives weekend couch potatoes an opportunity to get out to play ball," said 
Rodger Bailey, national project director for the flag football tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition is open to people of all ages and abilities, ranging from 
college football players to "armchair quarterbacks," those who sit in front of 
their television set and flip the remote control, said Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 However, dubbed the "super bowl of flag football," the event is for spectators 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Described as a football festival, events will include a field goal kicking 
contest where fans can test their skills. There is the Fastest Man Challenge 
where spectators can measure how fast they run compared to the records of 
professional football players. 
</P>
<P>
 The prerequisite stadium food -- hot dogs, hamburgers, french fries and soft 
drinks -- will be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandise from one of the major sponsors, Champion, will be sold along with 
NFL products. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-minute games will be played simultaneously on more than 20 miniature 
football fields. For the $100 entry fee per team, each of the five players 
receives a T-shirt and gets to play three games. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 teams have preregistered to compete in the tournament. The 
winner will play the winning team from the UC Irvine competition, scheduled for 
next weekend. The winner of that game will receive an all-expenses-paid trip to 
compete in Boca Beach Club in Florida. Proceeds will go to local charities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you never had a chance to play in the NFL, you can come out and play for 
the NFL 4-on-4 Flag Football," said Bailey. CHAU LAM

 A top state official has reappointed Oxnard School District trustee Mary 
Barreto to a council that advises state Department of Education officials on 
policy issues dealing with ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto was appointed this week by acting state Supt. of Public Instruction 
William Dawson to serve a third consecutive year on the 14-member Advisory 
Council on Hispanic Affairs.She is the only representative from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The council meets three times a year to discuss a range of issues that in the 
past have included the state's policies on bilingual education, the voucher 
proposal and the criteria for the hiring of teachers, a state official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful experience," Barreto said of her time on the board. "I 
really feel the board makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Barreto said the board will play a role in the selection of a new 
state superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's first meeting will be in mid-March. MATTHEW MOSK

<P>
 The superintendent of a tiny school district outside Camarillo has been 
selected to travel around the United States to inspect schools nominated for a 
national education honor. 
</P>
<P>
 The U. S. Department of Education has named Dennis J. Convery, superintendent 
of the Mesa Union School District in Somis, as one of about 75 site visitors 
for the federal Blue Ribbon Schools Program. 
</P>
<P>
 As a site visitor, Convery will be assigned to travel to three schools 
nominated by their states to become Blue Ribbon schools. 
</P>
<P>
 His job will be to verify that the institutions have test scores, attendance 
records and other marks of academic performance matching their claims in their 
applications to the federal Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Convery, who also served as a site visitor from 1998 through 1990, said he 
became involved with the Blue Ribbon Schools Program after Mesa Junior High 
School -- one of the two schools in the 350-student Mesa district -- received 
the honor in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in the early 1980s to help quell growing criticism of public schools, 
the Blue Ribbon Schools Program has honored more than 2,000 of the nation's 
110,000 public schools for academic excellence and strong community 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Convery said his willingness to volunteer for the program stems from his 
belief in the program's importance to schools recognized as Blue Ribbon 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great pat on the back to the teachers and employees," he said. "It 
stays with you for a long time. It verifies the things you're trying to do for 
kids." MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; CAR PASSENGER, 15, IS SHOT IN THE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 15-year-old boy was wounded when someone shot at the car in which he was 
riding, Santa Paula authorities said Friday. Police said the incident was 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was hit once in the back with a .45-caliber bullet that passed through 
the car's trunk, the back seat and the front passenger's seat where he was 
sitting. He was listed in stable condition Friday in the intensive care unit at 
Santa Paula Memorial Hospital, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred just before 6:30 p.m. Thursday on the Palm Street 
on-ramp to California 126. The boy was riding in a car driven by Jose Diaz, 18, 
when three bullets -- two .45-caliber bullets and one .22-caliber round -- 
pierced the back of the car. Police found a fourth shell casing lying nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who said the youth and Diaz were refusing to cooperate with the 
investigation, have made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're following up a couple of very, very weak leads," said Sgt. Gary 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the physical evidence indicates that the shots were fired either by 
two people standing near the on-ramp or riding in a car chasing Diaz and the 
boy.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have found no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall said the 15-year-old and Diaz are considered active members of a 
Santa Paula gang. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the boy was shot in the stomach at close range with a .38-caliber 
revolver during a fight with two other gang members. The bullet passed through 
his abdomen but did not strike any other vital organs, Marshall said. JULIE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; EX-PLANNER IS FINED $2,000 FOR LATE FILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Fillmore planning commissioner was fined $2,000 this week by the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission for filing her 1990 
economic-disclosure statement more than 14 months late. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecelia Corl, who left the commission in June, said the fine was unfair and 
that she cannot pay it because she's bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can try to collect, but I have no assets, no interest accounts and no 
money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanette Turvill, a spokeswoman for the state commission, said, "She can't use 
her bankruptcy to hide from the fine. We can wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Corl admitted missing deadlines, but said she was preoccupied with the affairs 
of her failing family machine-shop business at the time.  
</P>
<P>
 "I admit I made a mistake by not filing in a timely manner, but at the time, 
that was the least of my worries," she said. "I was busy trying to save a 
60-year-old business from going under."  
</P>
<P>
 The FPPC statements are used to ensure that public officials list their 
economic interests in companies they may regulate to avoid any conflicts of 
interests, Turvill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no conflict of interest in this case," Turvill said. "She just 
failed to report. This was not a high priority for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Turvill said that Corl was repeatedly sent notices that she missed deadlines. 
After missing her final deadline, a $10-per-day fine was assessed until it 
reached the $2,000 maximum. Corl said she never knew that there was a potential 
she would pay a $2,000 fine, but Turvill said that ignorance was not a defense 
in this case. She said the forms clearly outline the obligations to file the 
forms on time. 
</P>
<P>
 While the state levied $1.8 million in fines in 1993, most public officials 
file on time.  
</P>
<P>
 "We still have 98% of the public officials completing the forms" on time, 
Turvill said. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; PINE MOUNTAIN ROAD SECTION IS CLOSED

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U. S. Forest Service has closed Pine Mountain Road north of Ojai to all 
vehicle traffic because too many drivers are ignoring basic safety rules, 
officials said this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The narrow strip of road, which intersects California 33 about 35 miles north 
of Ojai, has on weekends become congested with as many as 200 cars heading for 
the snow in the Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cars get stuck, traffic is snarled and we get a lot of fender-bender 
accidents and confrontations," Ojai District Ranger Linda Riddle said. "It's a 
real mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Many drivers have been ignoring basic safety rules and driving along road 
shoulders and around barriers in the Pine Mountain Campground, Riddle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreation area is still open to skiers, sledders and others who want to 
park safely along California 33 and walk the two miles to the campground. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they would monitor the road and reopen it when it becomes safer 
for vehicle traffic, which is not expected to be before spring. For more 
information, call the Ojai Ranger District at 646-4348. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT AS ARCHEOLOGY DOCENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the native Chumash people, the Santa Monica Mountains held food, shelter 
and medicine. For today's youngsters, those same wooded hills hold wonder and 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold Creek Docents, a group that helps children grasp the large lessons of 
history and nature the mountains offer, is looking for volunteers to help guide 
children through those lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children are able to go through four of the different plant communities 
on the trail," said Jo Kitz, president of Mountains Restoration Trust, which 
oversees the docent organization. "Each of the plant communities was very 
important in producing food and medicine for the Chumash to be able to live 
quite comfortably." 
</P>
<P>
 Archeology docent training sessions begin on Jan. 17, said Kitz. Subjects 
include fire ecology, Chumash culture, geology, rock identification and how to 
interpret information learned on the mountain trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people like to take the class just for education for themselves," 
said Kitz. "But we are really looking for people to help with the docent work." 
</P>
<P>
 Docents work with children from public and private schools from Los Angeles 
County and Ventura counties and Oxnard.  
</P>
<P>
 The children go on ecology hikes and help recover, clean and sort artifacts 
from the soil. They learn about the artisanry of the highly skilled Chumash. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the program won the Take Pride in California Award from the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation and the Governor's Historic Preservation 
Award.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; ROBBER SOUGHT AFTER STORE CLERK IS SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police continued to search for a man who shot and wounded a clerk during a 
robbery at a Northridge record store, detectives said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk, Jony Parker, is in serious condition at Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center with a bullet wound to the upper torso, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives are looking for the gunman and a second man who witnesses told 
police drove the suspect away from the Music Plus record store at 8876 Corbin 
Ave. after the attack Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have described the suspects as males in their early to mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred about 11:45 a.m. when a man walked into the store, 
brandished a pistol and told Parker to give him money, said Los Angeles Police 
Detective Mike Brandt. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker handed over money from a cash register, but the man shot him anyway, 
Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the attack, the gunman got into a small white car outside the store and 
was driven away by the second man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are not sure why the robber shot Parker or how much money he 
escaped with. 
</P>
<P>
 There were several people inside the store at the time, but many customers 
were unaware there had been a robbery until after the gunman fled, Brandt said.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 167 ABANDONED CARS EARN A MAN HONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You can park your car in front of Morris Pichon's house, but just make sure 
you don't let it sit there too long. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday Pichon received a commendation by Los Angeles City Councilman 
Richard Alarcon for turning in 167 abandoned cars in his neighborhood over the 
past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, who also praised the efforts of city parking enforcement officers, 
said he was particularly grateful for Pichon's help because abandoned cars have 
been a longstanding problem in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, 1993, more than 4,350 cars have been reported abandoned in 
Alarcon's northeast Valley district, resulting in 469 cars being towed away and 
impounded, the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 52-year-old Lake View Terrace resident has been turning them in one at a 
time by calling 1 800-ABANDON, a number operated by the city's Bureau of 
Parking Enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm only doing what I think every good citizen should do and that is 
participating in local government," he told the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Pichon said that after he was laid off from his job in the aerospace industry 
in July he had a lot of time on his hands and decided to put it to good use. 
</P>
<P>
 But why target abandoned cars? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small personal passion," he said. "I just can't stand the sight of 
them." HUGO MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: FORUM TO ADDRESS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three San Fernando Valley congressmen and two other lawmakers from the region 
will be the featured guests at a forum on the effect of illegal immigration on 
the Valley's business climate, it was announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Already confirmed to attend the Jan. 19 seminar, sponsored by the Valley 
Industry and Commerce Assn. and the Latin American Business Assn., are 
Reps.Howard Berman (D-Panorama City), Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) 
and Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), said VICA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled to attend are Reps. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Xavier 
Becerra (D-Los Angeles), Kevin McCarthy from the Rand Corp., and Ronald Tasoff, 
an immigration attorney. "We want to hear what the impact of illegal 
immigration is on Valley businesses," said Bill Kenney, co-chairman of VICA's 
federal legislation committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to identify some of the problems -- if there are ones -- and then 
take a look at some of the pending legislative proposals to see if they address 
the problems we find," Kenney said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the forum, Kenney said VICA members will decide what positions the group 
should take on a dozen immigration proposals now pending in Washington. In 
April, VICA leadership will go to the nation's capital to present local 
lawmakers with the organization's legislative wish-list. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum will be held at the Warner Center Hilton from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
Jan. 19, and it will be open to the public. Non-members of VICA and the Latin 
American Business Assn. will be asked to pay a $30 attendance fee. JOHN SCHWADA

GIRL AWARDED $2 MILLION IN MOLESTATION LAWSUIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 12-year-old girl was awarded more than $2 million Friday in a civil lawsuit 
against her godfather, who was sentenced last year to three years in prison 
after pleading guilty to molesting the child. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge in Lancaster awarded Desiray Bartak $1 million general 
damages, $1 million in punitive damages, $1,000 in medical and special damages 
and $35,000 in future medical damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray, who said she decided to go public with her identity in the hope that 
she could encourage other child victims to pursue civil court cases against 
their abusers, sued Richard Streate, 30, on grounds of child sexual abuse, 
sexual battery, assault, emotional distress and negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Allred, Desiray's attorney, said she believes Desiray's civil case is 
the first of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who was 10 at the time Streate molested her, wrote a letter to 
Allred 15 months ago detailing the incidents and asking for the attorney's 
help, Allred said. At a January, 1993, news conference announcing her civil 
suit, Desiray said her father did not believe her when she told him that 
Streate, his childhood friend, had attacked her.

 "It's so other children will come forward," the girl said last year. "That's 
why I'm doing this. And to have parents realize it does happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray blamed Streate for her nightmares, loss of sleep and thoughts of 
suicide. She also changed schools, saying that once other children found out 
about the incident, she was taunted and told that the molestation was her 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "Desiray took this action because she believes that children who are abused 
should not be terrorized into silence by their abusers," Allred said. "Instead, 
wherever possible, they should learn their rights, break the silence and fight 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 This also marked the first case that Allred, a widely known feminist attorney, 
argued alongside her daughter, attorney Lisa Bloom. "It was a mother and 
daughter on behalf of another mother and daughter," Allred said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allred said that whether Desiray is able actually to collect the money from 
her abuser, a former construction worker and the married father of four 
children, is not the most important part of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "She feels that her rights have been vindicated," Allred said.

POTENTIAL SUCCESSOR VOWS SUPPORT FOR ROBERTI IN RECALL BATTLE; POLITICS: 
ASSEMBLY'S BARBARA FRIEDMAN WILL WAIT FOR REGULAR VOTE RATHER THAN OFFER 
HERSELF AS A REPLACEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman, widely viewed as the leading candidate 
to succeed embattled state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), said Friday she 
will wholeheartedly support Roberti's effort to defeat a recall campaign 
leveled against him by anti-gun control activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm supporting Sen. Roberti in whatever way I can," Friedman said in an 
interview. "He's played an incredibly valuable role on the gun-control issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, risking the ire of the forces lined up against Roberti, said she 
wants to expand existing gun-control measures, but offered no specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood Democrat added that she would not place her name on a 
recall ballot as a candidate to replace Roberti. If Roberti were recalled in a 
special election that could be held as early as April, his successor would be 
picked from a list of candidates appearing on the same ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Friedman said she would wait for the regular election cycle to run 
for Roberti's seat. Because of term limits, Roberti, recall or not, will be 
leaving office by year's end. The regular primary election to fill his seat 
will be held in June, with the general in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But by waiting, Friedman could be put in the awkward position of having to run 
against an incumbent -- that is, whoever won the recall election. "That's a 
theoretical possibility," Friedman acknowledged Friday. But it's not a factor 
that will govern her planning, she said. She will make a final decision on 
whether to run for Roberti's seat later this month, Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's political problems surfaced dramatically this week with the 
announcement that supporters of a recall drive against the state Senate leader 
had submitted 45,000 signatures to the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-Roberti forces need only 20,000 valid signatures to force a recall 
ballot -- and the registrar has already certified 10,000 as valid out of 17,000 
reviewed, spokeswoman Grace Romero said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's advisers are not optimistic that a recall can be avoided. Thursday, 
Roberti held a news conference to announce that he was prepared to fight "with 
every ounce of my being" against "the bully boys" and "wackos" of the anti-gun 
control movement sponsoring his recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall supporters, however, claim their gripe against Roberti goes beyond his 
1989 support for legislation banning the sale of military-style semiautomatic 
assault rifles. They accuse Roberti of being a soft-on-crime carpetbagger and 
of condoning political corruption in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall fight has begun to take the form of a national referendum with the 
disclosure Thursday that gun-control activist Sarah Brady, wife of James Brady, 
the presidential press secretary severely injured in the 1981 assassination 
attempt on Ronald Reagan, has vowed to throw her formidable national 
organization behind Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady's group, Handgun Control Inc., was the driving force behind last month's 
federal mandate of a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti aides expect a tough fight if the recall goes to a ballot test, 
because highly motivated special-interest groups often prevail in low-turnout 
special elections. 
</P>
<P>
 All this raises the prospect that Friedman, who represents the southern half 
of Roberti's Senate district in the Assembly, might face a tougher battle than 
expected in her bid to succeed Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the only person to commit to running in the recall election is Dolores 
White, who finished fourth in the 1992 vote that gave Roberti leadership of the 
20th Senate District. 
</P>
<P>
 But political observers expect other candidates to quickly enter the field 
should the recall qualify for the ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 There were also signs Thursday that although the recall forces are united in 
their desire to oust Roberti, they may split over his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned by reporters, recall leader William Dominguez said he would not 
endorse White, a Republican. "I'm a Democrat, and I don't want a Republican 
representing this district," said Dominguez, chairman of the Coalition to 
Restore Government Integrity, the ad-hoc group behind the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the potential pitfalls of declining to run in a recall election, 
Friedman is not without considerable political resources should she find 
herself running against an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43-year-old assemblywoman can expect the backing of the Howard 
Berman-Henry Waxman political machine, a group with a formidable following in 
the liberal and Jewish communities, and support from organized labor. Before 
her election to the Assembly in 1991, Friedman was a labor union official and a 
top aide to Los Angeles Controller Rick Tuttle.

WACHS PROPOSES GUN CONTROL REWARD PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joining a parade of city officials trying to reduce gun violence in the city, 
Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs on Friday proposed a $600 reward for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone illegally possessing 
or firing a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 While other programs often reward legal gun owners for giving up a firearm by 
offering money or theater tickets in exchange for weapons, Wachs said his plan 
targets those guns most likely to be used in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is aimed at people who break the law," he said at a news conference 
prior to introducing his proposal to the City Council, which is expected to 
consider the program next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state and federal agencies regulate gun sales and registration, 
Wachs' proposal is the latest in a series of efforts by Los Angeles city 
officials to restrict the possession of guns in a city plagued by gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, about 77% or 1,639 of the 2,116 homicides reported to the the Los 
Angeles County coroner's office were the result of gunshot wounds. That is a 
slight increase from 1991 when about 72% of the homicides were caused by 
gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the law that I'm proposing is not a panacea, it is something that can 
be done in Los Angeles and it is something that can be done today," Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other city efforts to clamp down on guns in the past few years include a ban 
on the sale of military-style assault weapons and plans for the city to host a 
nationwide gun control conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Ticketmaster launched a guns-for-tickets exchange that netted 412 
handguns, rifles, shotguns and assault rifles. The program, which was called a 
success by elected officials and police, provided movie, theater and sporting 
event passes in exchange for any gun, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike that program, Wachs said his reward plan will only target those who 
illegally possess or fire guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditional buy-back programs go to a lot of people who may have a gun in the 
closet for 10 years and then decide to bring it out when they find out they can 
get some money for it," he said. "That's not the kind of gun that is likely to 
be used in a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs said his reward program was not offered in response to any particular 
shooting incident but was an idea that came to him as he was thinking about the 
general problem of gun proliferation in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman said he has no idea how many illegal guns would be confiscated 
or how much the total program would cost the city. He said he is still studying 
ways to provide the reward without having to identify the person who collects. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Marvin Braude, a strong advocate of gun control and chairman of the 
City Council's Public Safety Committee, said Wachs' idea may have some merit 
and is worth considering. But he said he would like to convene at least two 
conferences on gun control to study all the options to see which can most 
effectively reduce gun proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is worth talking about and thinking about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the National Rifle Assn. supports penalties for those who illegally 
carry guns, a spokesman said the group has no position on Wachs' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Helsley, the NRA's state liaison in Sacramento, criticized the 
recent series of gun control efforts in Los Angeles, saying city officials 
erroneously believe gun control is the same as crime control. 
</P>
<P>
 He said city officials should concentrate on other ways to fight crime, such 
as keeping habitual criminals behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that what we are dealing with is frustration and the inability to 
address the real problems," Helsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Lt. John Duncan said he has not read Wachs' proposal and 
could not comment on the LAPD's position. Proposed Gun Control Measures * Last 
month, Councilman Marvin Braude suggested the city host conferences on gun 
control with representatives from other large cities nationwide. The motion was 
adopted 13 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * In November, Braude suggested the council lobby the Legislature to give 
local government power to enact local gun control laws. He also instructed the 
city attorney to identify what powers the city can use to clamp down on gun 
sales. His ideas are under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 * In October, 1992, the City Council voted 12 to 1 to approve an ordinance 
placing new restrictions on the construction of gun stores. The law requires 
public hearings before permits are issued for new gun shops. 
</P>
<P>
 * In November, 1991, Councilwoman Rita Walters proposed a system of 
registering guns and restricting the sale of ammunition. The city attorney has 
determined that regulation of gun sales and weapons registration is preempted 
by the state. So Walters is now studying a plan to require police permits to 
buy ammunition.  
</P>
<P>
 * In May, 1990, the City Council adopted a law banning the sale of ammunition 
seven days before New Year's Eve and the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 * In February, 1989, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky proposed a ban on the 
sale of military-style assault weapons in the city. The ordinance was passed 
unanimously but was later preempted when a similar law was enacted statewide.

SHOOTING SPREE IS SAID TO HAVE TARGETED 3 PEOPLE; THOUSAND OAKS: COURT IS TOLD 
WOMAN ACCUSED OF FIRING AT BUILDINGS KNEW SOME OF THE RESIDENTS. TRIAL IS 
ORDERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A 45-year-old woman accused of shooting up homes, vehicles, a church and a 
school in Thousand Oaks during a drunken rage knew at least three of the people 
whose homes were hit and may have targeted them, according to court testimony 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 During a preliminary hearing for Kathleen Ann Quinn, an investigator testified 
that Quinn once rented a house from one of the residents and was at least a 
casual acquaintance of two others. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, investigators had said they believed the Dec. 12 shooting spree 
was random. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing Friday's testimony, Municipal Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. said 
there was sufficient evidence to order Quinn to stand trial in Ventura County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19 criminal counts against Quinn, a messenger-service saleswoman, range 
from shooting at inhabited dwellings to drunk driving. No one was injured by 
the gunfire, but she is accused of firing into houses inhabited by children. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, authorities declined to speculate on Quinn's motive for 
allegedly firing at the homes of former friends, saying the reason would come 
out in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Matthew R. Findlay, who arrested Quinn at 9:45 the night of the 
shootings, testified Friday that he was patrolling the area near Los Robles 
Regional Medical Center after getting a call about drive-by shootings in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy said he spotted the suspect's car and saw the driver point a rifle 
out the window and fire at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 After Findlay turned on his overhead lights, Quinn emerged from the car 
unarmed, but told deputies to "go ahead and shoot me," Findlay testified. 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies attempted to arrest her, Quinn became belligerent and had to be 
forced to the ground by one of the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was she combative?" asked Quinn's lawyer, attorney Jenny Scovis of Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Findlay answered. "She was kicking and yelling while on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Joseph F. Braga, who is investigating the case, said he interviewed 
Quinn about two hours after her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very despondent, very depressed," Braga testified. "She was crying 
and seemed to be in a bit of a disarray." 
</P>
<P>
 After first denying the shooting, Quinn confessed after being reminded that a 
deputy had witnessed her sticking the gun out the window of her Ford Probe and 
firing at the hospital, Braga said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she was shooting at Christmas lights and residences that had 
Christmas trees," Braga testified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said Quinn told him she was despondent because she was in the middle of a 
divorce. She also told him that life had not been treating her fairly, Braga 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After consuming an undetermined amount of wine, Quinn "just loaded up her gun, 
put it in the car and started shooting," Braga testified. Her blood-alcohol 
level was found to be .15, nearly double the limit state law allows while 
driving, according to Braga. 
</P>
<P>
 Under direct examination by Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger A. Inman, Braga said it 
took some people several days to realize that their dwelling had been shot. One 
woman heard a shot that night but did not check her house until reading about 
the incident in a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal was inside La Reina High School on Janss Road when it was fired 
on, but school officials did not notice until the next day that a bullet had 
bounced off the school's metal front door. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident at another home had gone camping the night of the shooting and did 
not report that his motor home had been hit by a bullet until Dec. 27, more 
than two weeks after the incident. The man found the bullet inside the motor 
home and it matched Quinn's gun, Braga testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn was released from jail 16 hours after the shooting on $5,000 bail. She 
missed her next court date because she had checked herself into a hospital for 
psychological counseling. She was rearrested at the Woodland Hills facility 
Dec. 21 for failure to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 29, she pleaded not guilty in Municipal Court to the 19 counts. She is 
now free on $50,000 bail. Judge O'Neill set her Superior Court arraignment for 
Jan. 21.

FORMATION OF TASK FORCE TARGETING MAJOR DRUG CASES CONSIDERED; LAW ENFORCEMENT: 
COUNTYWIDE EFFORT WOULD DEPART FROM LOCAL DETAILS THAT FOCUS MAINLY ON 
STREET-LEVEL ACTIVITY. BUT OFFICIALS CAUTION THAT RESOURCES ARE THIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County law enforcement officials are studying the possibility of 
forming a countywide narcotics task force that would target major drug cases 
too complex and time-consuming for individual departments to tackle alone. 
</P>
<P>
 If formed, the task force would be a departure from local narcotics details, 
which focus mainly on street-level cases and neighborhood complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, a countywide task force would go after major dealers who supply 
larger quantities of drugs -- multiple ounces of heroin, kilos of cocaine and 
pounds of methamphetamine, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials familiar with the idea say they support the concept of a task 
force to target big-time traffickers. But they caution that practical 
considerations may outweigh possible benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that impacts drug investigations is going to be helpful," Sheriff's 
Sgt. Arnie Aviles said. "It's just a tough time trying it now because funds are 
so short and resources are very thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just hoping there's a feasible way for us to come together and do 
something with this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the county's top police officials and the district attorney formed 
a committee to study the idea of a task force. That committee met once in 
December and will meet again Wednesday at the Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in support of the task force," said Ventura Police Sgt. Bill Bogner, who 
sits on the committee. "But it's very, very early and whether it's ever going 
to evolve is anybody's guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, others say the fact that the county's top police officials have agreed 
to look at the concept is a step forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us in narcotics enforcement for years have seen the need for this," 
said Sgt. Mike Matlock, who supervises Oxnard's drug detail. "We're just happy 
now that there's a possibility that it could come to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard, where much of the county's drug activity occurs, is strongly behind 
the task force idea. But the whole county would benefit from it, Matlock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding and manpower are the biggest hurdles to establishing a task force. But 
there also must be agreement on a chain of command and the types of cases to be 
worked. Another issue is whether the task force would be permanent or assembled 
on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Once those issues are settled, the departments must agree on practical 
details, such as where the task force would be headquartered. 
</P>
<P>
 Countywide drug task forces have been assembled before, but not since the 
1970s, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a task force in quite a number of years," said Aviles, who is 
on the committee. "It's like starting from the ground up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say that if the task force is formed, they hope it will be 
permanent and include at least eight to 10 officers pooled from all or most of 
the county's agencies. State and federal agencies would work with the task 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 The individual agencies would continue to work street-level sales in their 
jurisdictions and benefit from the task force working larger cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Matlock said while it is important to respond to complaints of street-corner 
drug dealing, such tactics do little to stem the overall flow of narcotics into 
a community. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're just putting out little fires," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, a task force could focus on more complex cases that require 
enormous amounts of surveillance time. One example was the May 27 pre-dawn raid 
on nine Oxnard houses that led to the breakup of a sophisticated drug ring that 
shipped cocaine from Oxnard as far north as San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 That operation was part of a larger assault that concluded a three-year 
undercover investigation by federal and local agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet other Ventura County police officials question whether local agencies 
should spend time and money going after major drug dealers at a time when 
budgets are tight and detectives are being reassigned to the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something to be said for working the real big guys, but sometimes 
it's kind of like drilling for oil. You can put a lot of money down a dry 
hole," Undersheriff Richard Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an expensive proposition and it takes a lot of time that might be better 
utilized . . . on a different level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been no formal countywide task force since the 1970s, 
police agencies throughout the county work together frequently on narcotics 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department has operated a task force of its own in past years 
that has included representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
Drug Enforcement Administration, California Highway Patrol and Santa Paula 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Santa Paula will not assign an officer to work full time with the 
Sheriff's Department because of a shortage in its patrol division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our manpower was such that we had to bring an officer back and put him out on 
the streets," Santa Paula Police Cmdr. Bob Gonzales said. "Those are our 
immediate needs."

PRESERVING GENETIC DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest "Dangers of Narrowing the Field" (Column One, Dec. 23). 
The article correctly raises concerns over the loss of genetic diversity. It is 
a significant issue requiring attention. However, to preserve germ plasm that 
does not have an immediate use requires money. Commercial agriculture operates 
on a narrow margin. Universities with colleges of agricultural sciences have 
also been under serious financial pressure for several years. At the time when 
universities are needed to do more, they have fewer resources with which to 
accomplish tasks. Preserving genetic diversity is one such timely issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article tends to overlook, however, that a highly efficient agriculture 
is perhaps the best defense against environmental degradation. Where people 
have adequate supplies of nutritious and economically priced food, there is 
little reason for them to burn forests or intrude into other fragile 
environments in an attempt to feed their families. The development of 
high-yielding strains of both plant and animal varieties has made possible an 
abundance of quality food. 
</P>
<P>
 The university, within the limits of its funding base, is proceeding to 
develop sustainable technology that helps address the problem. One of our 
distinguished alumni, Lyle McNeal, director of the Navajo Sheep Project in 
Utah, has done wonderful work in attempting to preserve and improve the 
Navajo-Churro sheep. All such endeavors, however, have largely been funded 
through private sector resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems raised must be addressed. It will require dollars. In times of 
financial duress, it is the long-range need that is forgotten in terms of 
immediate survival.

 * Your fascinating story on the dramatic decline in the variety of 
agricultural animals and crops drove home the importance of preserving 
biodiversity. It is our ticket to a livable future. 
</P>
<P>
 This country has been the pioneer in saving species. Twenty years ago Congress 
passed the Endangered Species Act. A number of species have made dramatic 
comebacks since the act protected them, including the bald eagle, California 
gray whale, whooping crane, and peregrine falcon. Unfortunately, these success 
stories have been drowned out by controversies over the Stephens kangaroo rat 
and the northern spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
 Biodiversity is important for many reasons in addition to our planet's food 
supply. More than 25% of our nation's pharmaceuticals are derived from natural 
substances -- many of them from obscure plants and animals that have names that 
might sound strange. Taxol is derived from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, 
which logging companies used to burn as "trash" only three years ago. Now, it 
turns out to be an effective treatment for breast and ovarian cancer. Not only 
do such products save lives, they provide financial benefits to their 
manufacturers and others in the production chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Endangered Species Act is up for reauthorization. It should be 
strengthened. A bill that would do just that (H.R. 2043) has 100 co-sponsors, 
including 19 from California. Anyone who believes we ought to save species -- 
whether for moral or selfish reasons -- should let Congress know.

RACIST FLYERS FOUND IN WESTLAKE HIGH SCHOOL LOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks school officials on Friday found racist flyers stuffed into 
lockers at Westlake High School, less than a month after the same literature 
was distributed to hundreds of lockers at Simi Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar flyers have been found hidden in products at stores from Thousand Oaks 
to southern Los Angeles, officials say. While the materials appear to be 
protected by the First Amendment, police are investigating whether they can be 
connected to a growing number of hate crimes in Southern California, officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, police are pursuing misdemeanor assault charges against Allan 
E. Carlson, 30, of Glendale, who is suspected of putting the flyers into 
lockers at the high school the evening of Dec. 16. Carlson allegedly punched a 
custodian who told him to leave campus, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, police have said they could not prosecute him for distributing the 
flyers because they are protected by the Constitution's guarantee of free 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson also is awaiting trial in Los Angeles County on misdemeanor vandalism 
charges for allegedly stamping a racist message into blank notebook tablets at 
a store in Covina last August, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake High School administrators reported Friday's incident to police after 
students brought the materials to them, said Fred Van Leuven, director of 
secondary education for the Conejo Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We notified all other schools in the district to be on the lookout for the 
same type of activity," Van Leuven said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers advocate driving minorities from the United States, saying they are 
breeding so fast they threaten to overrun the white race. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers conclude with a phone number in the 818 area code to call for more 
information. The phone number leads to a recording that claims affiliation to 
the White Aryan Resistance, or WAR, a white separatist group. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Leuven said he did not know when or how many of the flyers were left in 
lockers at the school. The materials could have been distributed the night 
before, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it's offensive," Van Leuven said. "From our standpoint, it's 
unacceptable and we take it very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's detectives who investigated the Westlake High School 
incident said it wasn't clear whether the person who distributed the flyers had 
an otherwise legitimate reason to be on campus, said Sgt. Bruce Watlington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if it's a student with a right to be there, or someone who just 
walked onto school grounds, or an employee, or who it was," Watlington said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NONPROFIT GROUPS BID FOR $75,000 IN GRANTS; 
SANTA CLARITA: THE CITY COUNCIL ON TUESDAY WILL CONSIDER 32 REQUESTS FOR 
PORTIONS OF THE MONEY EARMARKED FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thirty-two nonprofit groups have applied for portions of a $75,000 grant 
offered by the city to help community service efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very impressed with the high caliber of grant applications we 
received and how much is actually being done in the community," said Rick 
Putnam, city director of parks, recreation and community services. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita established the annual program in 1990, shelving it during 1992, 
when funds went for recreation activities at the Santa Clarita Valley Senior 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been high interest in the Community Services Grant Program's return. 
Putnam and Santa Clarita City Council members Jo Anne Darcy and Jan Heidt 
reviewed the 32 applications and have recommended funding 21 of the requests, 
at a cost of $50,750. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire council is scheduled to consider the requests Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggested allocations include $5,000 to the Assn. to Aid Victims of Domestic 
Violence for a family violence protection project, $5,000 to the Boys & Girls 
Club for after-school programs at Emblem and Sierra Vista schools, $3,000 to 
the Samuel Dixon Family Health Center for expanded hours, $2,500 to the Santa 
Clarita Valley Food Pantry for two computers, and $2,000 to the Cedarcreek 
Elementary School PTA for landscaping improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining $24,250 will either carry over into the 1994-95 budget year for 
the program or be used to cover late expenses that meet the spirit of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have a way of coming up after the grant (program)," said Gail Foy, 
public information officer.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY HALL SHUTDOWN EVERY OTHER FRIDAY URGED; 
SANTA CLARITA: THE COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO 
EMPLOYEES' STAGGERED SCHEDULING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City offices would shut down every other Friday under a proposal to be 
considered by the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees proposed the scheme as an alternative to staggered schedules that 
now leave city offices half-staffed on Mondays. City department heads say the 
current system slows productivity and makes it difficult for residents to 
contact city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita placed employees on modified schedules two years ago to help 
meet standards established by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
The AQMD requires companies with 100 or more employees to reduce the number of 
trips they make in cars to work by encouraging car-pooling or alternative 
transportation, such as public transit or bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita has about 185 full-time employees. Under current scheduling, 
they work 80 hours over nine days rather than 10, with every other Monday off. 
</P>
<P>
 With half of the staff absent the first day of each week, it is often 
difficult for those who are working to perform their duties as they try to 
cover for missing employees, according to staff members. It is also a problem 
when supervisors and their employees work alternate Mondays.  
</P>
<P>
 "Frequently, when a member of the public calls or comes in to City Hall for 
certain services on that Monday, they find that the person or persons they need 
to see are not available," Assistant City Manager Ken Pulskamp said in a report 
to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is both difficult and confusing to explain to the public that staff works 
an 80-hour period while the appearance under our current system is that they 
are frequently missing from their posts." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the new schedule would shut down city offices every other Friday 
and extend their hours other days from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The move would 
also better align city schedules with Los Angeles County Public Works, Regional 
Planning and other offices that are closed every Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in City Hall supports the proposed change, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jan Heidt warned about the public perception that city employees 
would be working fewer hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes against my grain to think we wouldn't have the city open five days a 
week," Heidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the new schedule would take effect in February or March.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PARENTS ARGUE AGAINST ALL-YEAR CAMPUS; 
EDUCATION: THEY SAY RESTRUCTURING OLD ORCHARD ELEMENTARY'S SCHEDULE WILL HARM 
BILINGUAL, CLUSTERING AND OTHER PROGRAMS. THE SWITCH IS PLANNED FOR JULY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of parents and teachers have asked that Old Orchard Elementary School 
remain on a traditional schedule, saying the planned switch to a year-round, 
multitrack system in July will harm bilingual, clustering and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the year-round program, students are assigned to a track in which they 
alternately attend school for 60 days and have 20 days off. The four tracks are 
staggered so only three groups of students are on campus at one time, boosting 
a school's capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall School District trustees in May decided to move Old Orchard to a 
year-round schedule. Initially designed for 650 students and expanded to hold 
770 with the addition of portable classrooms, Old Orchard now has 783 students 
and enrollment is expected to continue growing. Its capacity would expand to 
accommodate 924 students under year-round multitrack. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say staggered scheduling is a better solution to overcrowding 
than portable classrooms because it takes pressure off the packed library, 
cafeteria, playgrounds and restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 residents debated the question Tuesday, with most in the crowd 
opposing the year-round plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents noted that Old Orchard won't have enough trained teachers to 
offer bilingual education in all four tracks, saying it effectively segregates 
minority students. Many predicted that the clustering program, in which 
students are grouped by ability rather than age, would also be difficult to 
continue if students are split into tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we may be overcrowded in the cafeteria, in the library or on the 
playground. But I don't send my children to school to use the library, play on 
the playground or eat in the cafeteria," parent Lauren Goetz said. "I send them 
to school to receive a quality education." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley Canyon and Valencia Valley elementary schools abandoned traditional 
schedules in July, and speakers associated with those campuses said the change 
has been a positive one. 
</P>
<P>
 Chazell Wilson is a teacher at Wiley Canyon, while her children attend Old 
Orchard. She said the program has significantly reduced overcrowding and 
improved student performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees will decide on Jan. 25 if Old Orchard will go year-round as 
scheduled.

MICKELSON SAVES FACE FOR YOUTH; REGULAR TOUR: HE SHOOTS A 68 AND PASSES SENIOR 
LEADER STOCKTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Much of the talk the last two days has been about senior Dave Stockton scoring 
better than the players on the regular PGA Tour in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second round of the $1.5-million Mercedes Championships, the youngest 
player on the course put an end to the talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-hander Phil Mickelson, from San Diego, overcame erratic tendencies to 
shoot a four-under-par 68 Friday at La Costa Resort and Spa for a 36-hole total 
of 138. 
</P>
<P>
 A birdie at the long, tough par-four 18th put Mickelson, 23, at six under par, 
one shot ahead of Stockton -- who remains the senior leader -- and one ahead of 
three others in the regular tour event. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Couples, regaining control of his game on the back nine; Fiji's Vijay 
Singh, among the co-leaders after the first round; and Grant Waite of New 
Zealand are at 139. Couples birdied Nos. 11, 12 and 17 to post a 70 to go with 
his 69 in the first round. Singh bogeyed the last hole to wind up with the same 
figures. Waite shot a 69 after his first-round 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Davis Love III also shot a second-round 69 and is tied with 
Billy Mayfair at 140. Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite are among four players at 141. 
At the halfway point, there are 16 golfers within five shots of the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's neat that the seniors are doing so well," said Mickelson, who 
won the Buick of California event at his home course, Torrey Pines, just down 
the road to get into this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize until today that the seniors were playing from the same tee. 
I had always been curious about how they would stack up with us. I had always 
heard they played shorter courses. But they are not that far behind us. I think 
it's great." 
</P>
<P>
 Until he surprised everyone while still a student at Arizona State and won at 
Tucson to qualify for the then Tournament of Champions of 1992, Mickelson had 
played only one round at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that easy to get on," Mickelson said. "So, I don't know why I am 
doing so well. I really haven't played since Thanksgiving time, when I was in 
Japan. I spent last week skiing in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, taking time off is a blessing. While gliding down the slopes my 
mind is on golf and the changes I want to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not concerned with winning tournaments as much as I am with improving my 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the other guys on the regular tour are like me. We're erratic this 
early in the year." 
</P>
<P>
 On the first five holes of the second round, Mickelson had two birdies and two 
bogeys. But on the 398-yard eighth hole, he started to warm to his task. He had 
three birdies in a row, then had another at No. 13 before the eight-foot putt 
on the last hole put him in front of everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples and Singh figure to pressure Mickelson. Couples, saying he felt better 
after battling flu, rallied on the back nine. Singh, the long hitter who has 
moved from Fiji to London, has been playing brilliantly for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite, who was one of four players to shoot a 68 Friday, also figures to be in 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time early in the day it seemed that Greg Norman might be ready to take 
charge. He surged to five under par going to the 180-yard 11th hole. But he hit 
his tee shot into the water and started a drop to finish at 143. 36-Hole 
Leaders at La Costa

 Top 10 reasons why Florida State was voted No. 1: 
</P>
<P>
 10. NCAA tabled proposal mandating drug testing for poll voters. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Avoid Bowden family strife, which would have occurred if Terry had won 
national championship before Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Florida State played an NFL-type schedule (although those ACC teams look a 
lot like Tampa Bay and Indianapolis). 
</P>
<P>
 7. Under Title IX, Notre Dame had already filled its quota of national 
championships for the next 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 6. The grace, wit and charm of Scott Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Under proposed NFL rule change, head-to-head tiebreaker is abolished in 
favor of coach's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Could not let USC be the only team to win championship on phantom 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Notre Dame championship would have ruined ending to Oliver Stone's upcoming 
movie, "FSU." 
</P>
<P>
 2. Voters felt compelled to give Lifetime Achievement Award to Bobby Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Just kidding . . . there is no good reason.

 I love to see Notre Dame lose, especially when the losses are extremely 
painful. One of my greatest thrills was on Nov. 28, 1964, when Rod Sherman of 
USC caught a touchdown pass that enabled the Trojans to steal a national 
championship and unbeaten season from Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 For Notre Dame to lose the national championship to Florida State (after the 
Irish had beaten the Seminoles) is the most perfect kind of pain that could be 
inflicted upon Notre Dame's alumni and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't happen to a nicer bunch.

 C'mon, Gene Wojciechowski. Your rationalizations don't hold water. Sure Holtz 
reversed himself from 1989. What coach wouldn't go to bat for his team? 
Everyone knows you either love Notre Dame or hate them, a part of the mystique 
of any great team.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm willing to place a good wager that most of the same coaches and writers 
who voted for Miami in 1989, when head-to-head competition was the tiebreaker, 
reversed their position and rationalized like you in favor of Florida State. 
Bowden won because he's a nice guy. The Irish got the shaft.

 Lou Holtz and his team should be commended for a fine season. For 12 Saturdays 
they battled their opponents on the field amid accusations of Holtz's program 
betraying its ideals to win. The Fighting Irish persevered and showed what true 
champions are. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be interesting to see if Florida State can do the same next season, 
when the new best-seller hits the streets in August: "Wearing the Tarnished 
Ring: How Florida State Won Its First National Championship."

VIEWPOINT / LETTERS; AS IF BRUINS DIDN'T GET ENOUGH BADGERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Never was I so embarrassed as a lifelong UCLA guy as I was when I walked into 
the Rose Bowl and saw there were large numbers of fans in red in every section. 
What became immediately clear was that literally thousands of mercenary UCLA 
"fans" had sold out their team for a few dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 I shouldn't have been surprised. The same thing on a much smaller scale 
happened a few years ago when Fresno State came into Pauley Pavilion for an NIT 
game. The sort of person who sold his ticket, who claims to be a Bruin fan, is 
the same sort who calls for the coach's neck if the team loses two games in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 These Judases , and you know who you are, should simply have declined the 
opportunity to purchase Rose Bowl tickets so that Bruins who actually wanted to 
support the team could have filled those seats. 
</P>

 Bruin players on the sideline and on the field tried to get the UCLA student 
section to start cheering during the Rose Bowl, but this would have been 
impossible because more than half of the student-section seats were occupied by 
Wisconsin fans. I was surprised that the halftime card stunt was even possible. 
</P>
<P>
 No fewer than a dozen scalpers were by the Pauley Pavilion ticket windows on 
Friday (Dec. 31), offering as much as $270 for each student ticket. Each ticket 
was stamped with "UCLA STUDENT ID REQUIRED," but Rose Bowl and UCLA officials 
did not even ask for student identification at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything has its price, and UCLA student spirit is $270.

 What a day New Year's was for visiting Wisconsin fans, who escaped sub-zero 
weather to see the Rose Bowl played under a comfortable Southern California 
sun. But, hey, Bruin fans, why drive all the way to Pasadena when you can watch 
the game from the comfort of your living-room couch? 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because your team needed you. 
</P>
<P>
 As a UCLA alumnus, the lack of fan support was more disappointing to me than 
the loss of the game. In a stadium that should have been dominated by blue and 
gold, there was enough red clothing to cover the state of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 We scoffed at the Badger fans' nickname, but I'd rather be a Cheesehead than a 
couch potato.

 All we've read about and heard on TV for three days is, "Oh, those poor 
Wisconsin fans." The simple, honest, hard-working Badger fans have been taken 
advantage of by the evil, sick, pathetic citizens of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 We are UCLA season-ticket holders and have been for 10 years. As such, we were 
able to get tickets at face value, $46. They weren't our normal seats, however, 
and we wound up sitting in the north end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did we know, our seats were two rows behind the Wisconsin student 
section. These poor, simple, honest fans never sat down the entire game. In 
fact, they stood on their seats all game. Any suggestion to sit and allow fans 
sitting behind to observe the game was met with obscene gestures and profanity. 
After each UCLA celebration (there weren't many) Badger fans threw garbage and 
insults at UCLA fans. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never seen fans as obnoxious and unruly in 10 years. Let's quit feeling 
so sorry for these people.

 For years, Jim Healy has used brain surgeons when he refers to USC's football 
team. After UCLA's performance in the Rose Bowl (especially Wayne Cook), I 
think it is only fitting to refer to the Bruin football team as nuclear 
physicists.

 The sale-demise of KMPC is certainly no surprise to the longtime L.A. radio

 Only Jim Healy was a consistent high spot. Doug Krikorian had a little pizazz, 
but he was eventually pushed out. The political correctness of having Paola (uh

fanatic, like myself.

LOYOLA ENDS STREAK WITH A NEW LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount's basketball players, accustomed to losing close shaves, were 
proudly wearing them Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing their first game with Marine-style buzz cuts, the Lions routed 
Buffalo, 93-77, at Gersten Pavilion to post their first victory of the season 
and end a 19-game losing streak, the longest among NCAA Division I teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we win, after each game, I'll keep giving haircuts," said redshirt 
freshman John Anthony, Loyola's barber. "It pulled us together. None of us were 
down, but it made everything a little lighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most relieved was Coach John Olive, whose team had not won since Jan. 
30 of last season and had lost its previous three games by a total of seven 
points, including two in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice for the kids because so much was being made of the streak," Olive 
said. "These kinds of things get magnified. It's good to get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior forward Wyking Jones led Loyola (1-9) with a career-best 32 points, the 
most scored by a Lion in two seasons under Olive. Sophomore center Ime Oduok 
added 15 points and pulled down a career-best 22 rebounds, the most by a Lion 
since Hank Gathers had 27 in the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola took control by outscoring Buffalo, 22-7, in the last 10 minutes of the 
half to open a 39-27 lead. Jones scored 12 of his 20 first-half points during 
the run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions opened the second half with a 14-4 surge, taking a 53-31 lead on 
Anthony's three-point basket with 15:32 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo (4-9), losing for the eighth time in nine games, was led by guard 
Modie Cox, with 24 points.

NBA ROUNDUP; CHILLY CELTICS LOSE FIFTH IN A ROW AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Boston Celtics were cold again in the old building where they once were so 
tough to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Cavaliers weathered the Boston Garden's frigid conditions and 
rolled to a 99-85 victory Friday night, ending a nine-game road losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics, who lost no more than five home games in three of the last eight 
seasons, dropped their fifth in a row at Boston Garden -- one short of the 
franchise record set in 1948-49 -- to a team that had the NBA's second-worst 
road record.  
</P>
<P>
 The cold didn't stop Bobby Phills from scoring a career-high 20 points for the 
Cavaliers. He made 10 of 12 shots in only his eighth start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so cold in here I couldn't feel my hands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 110, Minnesota 103 -- Danny Ainge made up for injuries to Charles 
Barkley and Kevin Johnson and Dan Majerle's one-for-14 shooting by scoring a 
season-high 34 points, leading the Suns at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ainge made four of six three-pointers and scored 10 points in the final 5:33. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley suffered a strained tendon in his right knee when he landed 
off-balance after an alley-oop pass in the first quarter. He returned in the 
second quarter, but left with 4:46 to play in the half and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson sat out his second consecutive game because of a bruised right shin. 
Neither injury is believed serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 99, Washington 92 -- Scottie Pippen scored 25 points, including the 
go-ahead basket with 1:50 to play at Landover, Md., as the Bulls beat the 
Bullets for the 12th successive time. 
</P>
<P>
 Horace Grant had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Bulls, who outscored 
Washington, 7-0, in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 110, Utah 104 -- Glen Rice scored 13 of his 27 points in the fourth 
quarter as the Heat won for the first time at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Rony Seikaly added 17 points for the Heat. Miami has won three consecutive 
games and ended a string of seven consecutive losses at Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 84, Denver 76 -- David Robinson and Dale Ellis made key baskets 
down the stretch as the Spurs held the Nuggets scoreless in the final 3:58 at 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs, defeating the Nuggets for the seventh consecutive time dating to 
last season, built a 19-point lead just before halftime, then had to survive a 
second-half Nugget rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 100, Portland 85 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 26 points and Kevin 
Willis had 19 points and 17 rebounds at Atlanta, leading the Hawks to their 
fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 20th victory in 23 games for the Hawks, who built double-digit 
leads with a 15-4 spurt in the first quarter and an 18-4 burst in the third 
before withstanding a fourth-quarter rally by the Trail Blazers with a 14-3 run 
in the final 3:17. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 103, Dallas 93 -- Dana Barros scored 10 of his 26 points during a 
decisive 13-6 fourth-quarter run at Dallas as the 76ers dealt the Mavericks 
their 15th consecutive home defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Weatherspoon had 25 points and 14 rebounds, Jeff Hornacek scored 23 
points and rookie Shawn Bradley blocked a career-high nine shots for the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 102, Sacramento 93 -- Shawn Kemp scored nine of his 19 points in the 
final four minutes as the SuperSonics held off the Kings at Seattle their 14th 
victory in 15 home games. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Lionel Simmons' eight consecutive points, the Kings trailed only 88-85 
with 3:53 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics answered with a 12-5 run led by Kemp, who capped the spurt 
with a reverse two-handed dunk for a 100-90 lead with 1:37 remaining.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Francis scored with five seconds to play in overtime Friday night, giving 
the Pittsburgh Penguins a 4-3 victory over the Buffalo Sabres at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Francis' second goal of the game and capped a comeback by the 
Penguins.Francis had scored on the power play at 14:51 of the first period to 
put the Penguins ahead, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Patterson and Joe Mullen also scored for Pittsburgh. Yuri Khmylev scored 
twice for Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very tough loss," Sabre Coach John Muckler said. "They gave us all 
kinds of chances and we didn't score. We just couldn't put them away." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton 6, Quebec 4 -- Defensemen Dave Manson and Igor Kravchuk scored 42 
seconds apart to highlight a four-goal third period to rally the Oilers at 
Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Rice and Jason Arnott also scored in the third period for the Oilers, 
who trailed, 3-2, midway through the period. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 4, Florida 1 -- John MacLean scored a pair of first-period goals to 
lead the Devils at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the fourth in a row for the Devils and their seventh in nine 
games. The victory also improved their record within the Atlantic Division to 
11-6. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was Florida's second in a row after a five-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 6, Calgary 2 -- Pierre Turgeon had two goals and an assist, 
and Jamie McLennan stopped 23 shots in his NHL debut at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended a four-game losing streak for the Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Turgeon, who recorded his first multi-goal game since Nov. 21, scored his 
second of the game at 10:12 of the third period, converting a pass from Tom 
Kurvers to give the Islanders a 5-2 lead.

top-ranked and nationally recognized Calvary Chapel and second-ranked and state 
respected El Modena, the Eagles were heavily favored. 
</P>
<P>
 But few figured this heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of a standing-room-only crowd, defending State champion Calvary 
Chapel walked off with a 45-12 victory, and left a dazed El Modena wondering if 
the gap between the county's first and second-ranked teams is really that 
great. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we'd do better than 12 points," said Juan Alvarez, the Vanguards' 
135-pound wrestler who was undefeated before his 4-3 loss to Mauricio Mora. 
</P>
<P>
 But Calvary Chapel (10-0) got pins from Burt Pierson, Joe Calavitta, Dane 
Valdez and Eli Coon in four of the first five classes -- it won on a technical 
fall by Shane Valdez in the other -- and El Modena (18-1) couldn't stop the Big 
Church Boyz Machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of classes we figured we'd win and they got pins," El Modena Coach 
Alan Clinton said. "You get that snowball effect and it's hard to come back 
from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has heard all about the Valdez brothers, freshman sensation Calavitta, 
Mora and others. But it was the unknown Eagles whom he applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed by John's kids who never get the press," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids such as Coon, who was losing by as many eight points at 130, before he 
scored on a reverse and turned it into a pin against Daniel Amaya at 5 minutes 
30 seconds, to give Calvary Chapel a 29-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm usually not as solid as the rest of the team, but I'm working on it," 
Coon said. "Coach told us never to give up. Once he started getting tired and I 
felt (the pin), I wasn't going to let it go." 
</P>
<P>
 After Mora's narrow victory in one of the featured matches, El Modena won its 
first points when David Wells pinned Joe Pierson at 34 seconds in their 
140-pound match. At 145, Chris Jaime was an 8-5 winner against Danny Robinson 
to pull the Vanguards to 32-9. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the 12-8 decision by the Eagles' Josh Holiday over Aaron Santana in 
a key matchup at 152, El Modena trailed 35-9, and were technically eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured we'd beat them, and I thought it would be closer," Calvary Chapel 
Coach John Azevedo said. "But we're nationally ranked and El Modena isn't at 
that level."

PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; CENTURY CAN'T HIT ITS FREE THROWS; 
TRABUCO HILLS WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Century won the chess match against visiting Trabuco Hills, but lost the 
free-throw shooting contest badly and wound up losing the game in overtime, 
57-54, Friday in the Pacific Coast League opener. 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth-ranked Centurions played Coach Greg Coombs' slow-down game to near 
perfection and were patient against fifth-ranked Trabuco Hills' zone. But when 
it came time to shoot free throws, the Centurions didn't have a clue -- making 
only 11 of 27, including six for 20 in the second half and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Trabuco Hills (13-4, 1-0) made 22 of 27 from the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terrible," Coombs said of his team's troubles at the line. "We have a 
very young team with five sophomores. But we have to do a better job (at the 
line). There's no excuse for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Century's most costly misses came at the end of regulation as it clung to a 
four-point lead in the last 1 minute 30 seconds. Hector Negrete and Gabe 
Aguirre missed front ends of one-and-ones that could have put away Trabuco 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our work cut out for us," Coombs said. "We let them off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills forward John Paisley helped take his team off the hook with his 
second-half play. Paisley scored 13 of his 15 points after intermission and 
grabbed a team-high nine rebounds. A three-point play by Paisley brought the 
Mustangs to within 51-50 at 1:52. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Karnoff's free throw with 1:28 left tied the score at 51-51, but Century 
(14-3, 0-1) could have won the game in regulation had Ike Harmon's eight-foot 
baseline jumper gone in. Instead, his shot curled around the rim and came out. 
</P>
<P>
 Century missed three of four free throws in overtime; Trabuco Hills sank six 
of seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills also got a boost when Thomas Harmon (15 points, six rebounds) 
fouled out late in regulation. Harmon's inside post game was the main reason 
Mustang Coach Rainer Wulf had his team play zone defense throughout much of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of respect for Thomas," Wulf said. "He's very difficult to 
defend. We were in a gimmick defense where we had two guys on Thomas every 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills dared the Centurion guards to take any shot they wanted outside 
eight feet, but they rarely accepted the invitation, often holding the ball for 
minutes at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted it to be a slow-down game," Coombs said. "We just missed a lot of 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Pacific Coast League games: 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia 46, Costa Mesa 42 -- Zack Richardson scored 14 points, including 
three three-pointers, for Estancia (10-6, 1-0). Ryan Steck had 16 points, 16 
rebounds and seven assists for Costa Mesa (6-9, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills 57, Laguna Beach 40 -- Jessie McDonald scored 21 points and had 
10 rebounds, and Jason Charles added 12 and nine assists for host Laguna Hills 
(6-8, 1-0). Gordon Osborn scored 18 points to lead Laguna Beach (4-11, 0-1).

RESEDA IS READY FOR ROUGH STUFF; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: CROSS SCORES 20 AS 
REGENTS MOVE TO 13-0 WITH 72-63 WIN OVER PHYSICAL CHATSWORTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Battered, bloodied, bowed, bruised. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Trenton Cross may carry a souvenir from Reseda High's 72-63 victory over 
Chatsworth in a Northwest Valley Conference opener on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a not-so-subtle reminder of exactly how rough the game was. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was physical," said Cross, who suffered a nasty cut when he got socked 
under his right eye. "I still can't really see out of this eye. It's still 
blurry." 
</P>
<P>
 When his Cross-eyed vision gets back to 20-20, the Reseda guard will see that 
he scored 20 points and that the Regents (13-0, 1-0 in league play) are still 
undefeated. Interesting that Reseda Coach Jeff Halpern used the word "focused" 
about three times in his spirited postgame interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are tough," Halpern said, his voice rising to a crescendo. "They 
don't back down to anyone. We could not let them come into our house and 
intimidate us." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth (8-7, 0-1) had a pronounced height advantage, but it didn't help 
beyond the first quarter. The Chancellors raced to an 11-5 lead with inside 
muscle, but Reseda reserve Patrick Galan helped even the score -- and more. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, Galan scored all seven of his points and took some 
rebounding pressure off center Roderick Jones. What's more, Galan hit a 
three-point shot from midcourt at the halftime buzzer to give Reseda a 33-24 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a real backbreaker," Halpern said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thereafter, Reseda put the game on the backs of its guards. Cross and 
backcourt buddies Archie Williams and Damon Bailey combined for 50 points -- 
and 14 of the Regents' 18 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With Reseda holding a 40-33 lead with 4 minutes 15 seconds left in the third 
quarter, Williams (19 points) scored inside to start an 11-4 run. Jones, a 
transfer from Chatsworth, scored twice in the mini-burst and made sure everyone 
knew about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was into (the game), big," said Jones, who outscored opposing center Eddie 
Miller, 14-8. "It felt so good to get 'em back." 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda led by as many as 14 points in the fourth quarter, but Chatsworth made 
it close with a 16-6 run to pull to within 63-58 with 2:02 remaining. 
Chatsworth missed its next three shots, however, and Reseda made eight of 12 
free throws down the stretch to hold the Chancellors at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing, because the Reseda pep band had started playing "We Are the 
Champions" with 4:19 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big lift," Jones said. "People said we hadn't beat nobody big. But 
we can play with anybody in the 3-A (Division), the 4-A or wherever."

BAILEY'S BURST POPS HARVARD'S BALLOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of the game Friday night, Harvard-Westlake High basketball fans 
serenade Loyola's UCLA-bound guard Toby Bailey with chants of "overrated." 
</P>
<P>
 They might want to rethink that opinion now. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey took over in the fourth quarter, breaking open a close game and leading 
the Cubs to a 62-53 Mission League victory at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was Harvard's first of the season after 13 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to take the shots," said Bailey, who scored 24 points. "The team 
looks to me to be the man. I needed to do something to change the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines took a one-point lead into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey spent the first three minutes of the quarter on the bench to be rested 
for the stretch run. Neither team could score while Bailey was out. 
</P>
<P>
 He started with a layup that gave the Cubs (9-5, 4-0 in league play) their 
first lead since early in the third quarter, 47-46. Then he assisted on Todd 
Edwards' layup. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey followed with another layup while being fouled. After a jumper by 
Bailey's younger brother, Moose, Loyola led, 53-46, with three minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final moments, Bailey added a pair of highlight-film baskets on a 
reverse layup and a driving layup in which he cut around three defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really a great athlete," Wolverine guard Scott Garson said. "His 
presence is felt just like any other great player. That's why he's going to 
UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey scored eight points in the fourth quarter after not making a 
significant impact for the first 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, the chants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard them," Bailey said. "I could understand why they were saying it. I 
wasn't having too good a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey's strong fourth quarter helped the Cubs put Harvard (13-1, 3-1) in the 
loss column after a surprising start that included championships in the Covina 
and Faith Baptist tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Garson led Harvard with 16 points and six assists. Freshman Jason Collins had 
11 points and three blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 His twin brother, Jarron, scored 10 and grabbed a team-high 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half was tight throughout, with neither team leading by more than 
four after the Wolverines erased a quick 6-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead would change hands four times in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola pushed its lead to four late in the second quarter when Edwin Canady 
scored eight consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard led most of the third quarter, pushing its advantage to as many as 
seven points, but Loyola surged late in the quarter while Jason Collins was on 
the bench with three fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs pulled to within one as the fourth quarter began, setting up Bailey's 
heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got the best of us this time," Garson said. "Hopefully, we can get him 
back at their place."

SOUTH COAST LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; JUNIOR VARSITY COACHES FIGHT AFTER GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fight broke out between coaches after a junior varsity basketball game 
between Mater Dei and Dana Hills Friday night at UC Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior varsity assistants Jason Quinn of Mater Dei and Dennis Dickens of Dana 
Hills had to be separated by campus police after Quinn appeared to punch 
Dickens.Dana Hills varsity players, who were warming up at the time, charged 
the bench and had to be restrained, as did several fans who attempted to come 
out of the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred after Mater Dei's 75-47 victory. Witnesses said Dana 
Hills coaches complained to Mater Dei coaches that the Monarchs had run up the 
score, and an argument ensued. It grew more intense, and Quinn charged Dickens, 
throwing a punch before the two fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mater Dei official claimed Dickens made a derogatory remark before the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no arrests, and officials from both schools met after the game to 
investigate the matter. CHRIS FOSTER

PUNSALAN AND SWALLOW WIN TITLE AFTER ROCA AND SUR WITHDRAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local favorites Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow of Bloomfield Hills, 
Mich., won the dance competition in the U.S. Figure Skating Championships 
Friday night at Joe Louis Arena after defending champions Renee Roca and Gorsha 
Sur withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teams were tied for first place after Tuesday's compulsory dances, but 
Roca and Sur, of Colorado Springs, Colo., skated their original dance the next 
day only two hours after Roca broke her left wrist in a practice collision with 
two other skaters and dropped to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors decided afterward that the wrist required surgery because it had not 
set properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, I'm right-handed," Roca said. "I'm going on vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 She and Sur, a Russian defector, would not have been eligible for the one 
dance berth available to the United States in the Feb. 12-27 Winter Olympics in 
Norway because he is not a citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they plan to continue competing together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're going to start teaching judo," Roca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Punsalan and Swallow, who were married last September, earned the Olympic 
berth Friday night before a crowd of 8,687 with their first-place, free-dance 
program, which they skated to music from "The Mambo Kings." RANDY HARVEY

SPEEDSKATING / U.S. OLYMPIC TRIALS; TRAILING BLAIR IS NO DISGRACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following Bonnie Blair has been a habit for Chantal Bailey since she was a 
year behind Blair in high school in Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bailey didn't mind trailing Blair at the U.S. Olympic long track 
speedskating trials Friday, not when her second-place finish in the second 
staging of the 1,500-meter race won her a berth on the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, 28, is a former figure skater who took up speedskating six years ago. 
Her time of 2:09.02 was far off Blair's 2:04.85, but she is impressed by 
Blair's feats rather than daunted by them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking, 'Wait for me, Bonnie,' " joked Bailey, who barely missed 
qualifying for the 1992 team in the 1,000-meter race. Bailey could also qualify 
for the 1,000 at Lillehammer -- she was second to Blair in the first two 
1,000-meter races last weekend -- and she won the first go-round of the 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "To see that kind of time inspires me," Bailey said. "I look up to her a lot 
in that race and to what she has accomplished. . . . This is 23 years of 
dreaming of being an Olympian. I can't believe I actually made it." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, three-time gold medalist, has set track records in each of her seven 
races at the Pettit National Ice Center. Her time of 39.59 seconds in the 500 
was .17 seconds faster than her time last weekend, and her 1,500 time of 
2:04.85 was 1.65 seconds faster than her first race. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal was to skate under 2:06," she said. "I skated a solid, consistent 
race. . . . That's a real good time. I'm really happy with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair is not a certain she will enter the 1,500 at Lillehammer because it is 
scheduled between the 500 and the 1,000, her favorite races. "With the way 
she's been skating, it would be hard to turn down that race now," said her 
coach, Nick Thometz. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Jansen won the third running of the men's 500 in 36.44 seconds, his ninth 
consecutive time of 36.7 or faster. He also won the 1,500, in 1:56.49, but his 
coach, Peter Mueller, said Jansen hasn't decided whether to compete in the 
1,500 at Lillehammer. Jansen wants to concentrate on the 1,000 and 500 because 
Mueller said the latter race is one Jansen can't lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he skates a solid race, they won't beat him," Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Zuckerman of Milwaukee and Michelle Kline of Wauwatosa, Wis., finished 
third and fourth, respectively, in the women's 1,500 and probably will make the 
Olympic team. Their qualification is in doubt only because the U.S. team is 
limited to eight entrants in the women's races. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Mills of Evanston, Ill., finished second in the men's 1,500, ahead 
of Brian Wanek of Mequon, Wis., and Dave Tamburrino of Saratoga Springs, N.Y. 
Ten U.S. men can compete at Lillehammer.

OAK PARK'S BID RUNS AFOUL AT SANTA CLARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Clara is a school rich with basketball tradition. Championship banners 
proudly hang throughout the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Lou Cvijanovich said his team was an underdog against Oak Park, it was 
quite a statement from a man in his 36th season of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Clara's trademark man-to-man defense and poor free-throw shooting by 
Oak Park helped the Saints emerge with a 49-39 nonleague victory Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what anyone says, (when) a 13-1 team takes on a 7-7 team, we're 
the underdog," Cvijanovich said after his team improved to 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
 When Oak Park jumped to a 10-2 first-quarter lead, Cvijanovich's fears appears 
well-founded. However, Santa Clara held Oak Park to five points in the third 
quarter and the Saints took a 27-24 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Troubles at the foul line spoiled any chance of an Oak Park rally. The Eagles 
hit only six of 25 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were terrible, miserable, whatever, from the line," Oak Park Coach Bob 
Hall said. "Against Moorpark we hit 22 of 26, then tonight, this happens. It 
was the difference in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Williams had 16 points to for Oak Park, and Ryan Garth added 11. Santa 
Clara, which had three starters foul out, was led by Jeff Pena with 12 points, 
and Kevin Collins contributed 10. BRYAN RODGERS

INTEREST IN SZYK SHOW GROWS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Following publication of the article (on the exhibit in Placentia of works by 
Polish manuscript illuminator Arthur Szyk, "Illuminated by Arthur Szyk's Work," 
Dec. 24), I have received telephone calls from San Francisco, New York, Boca 
Raton and many other places around the country. Readers in Orange County read 
the article and sent it to their friends and relatives.I have also received 
several calls from local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Placentia Library reports visitors from Riverside, Corona and other cities 
outside Orange County. Rita Chemers of Chemers Gallery, who was mentioned in 
the article, also reports many telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The library has extended the exhibit until Jan. 31. Szyk's World War II 
cartoons will be added to the exhibit this week. His cartoons are collected 
around the world and were very popular. 
</P>
<P>
 During the war, they appeared in many newspapers, and magazines, including 
Collier's and Esquire. In the archives, I find mention of a survey carried out 
by Esquire. The findings were that Szyk's cartoons were favored by the troops 
over the "pinup" girls! These pages now sell for $35 and $50 each!

 Thank you.

CRITIC SHOULD GET REAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than once during his tenure as a Times film critic, Kenneth Turan has 
proven that he has absolutely no idea what he's writing about in his reviews. I 
thought he had reached his pinnacle with his review of "Mrs. Doubtfire," in 
which he lambasted Robin Williams for growing as an actor (and thus providing 
further proof to my theory that those who cannot do, write reviews).I thought 
as much, that is, until I read his review of "Philadelphia" ("Bittersweet 
'Philadelphia,' " Dec. 22). 
</P>
<P>
 My objection has nothing to do with his opinion of "Philadelphia" but, 
instead, with his comment concerning the lead character's (Tom Hanks) family. 
In Mr. Turan's words, Hanks' character "has the kind of idealized support 
circle only people in the movies seem to manage. His parents are totally 
supportive, as are his siblings and their spouses." So, in the gospel according 
to Kenneth, if it happens in the movies, it can't be real. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, Mr. Turan, wake up and smell what you're writing. . . . I have 
friends who suffer from AIDS, including two who have died, and I have seen what 
it means to them to have the love and support of parents and family members. 
For these people, that "support circle" you speak so cynically of in your 
review is what keeps them going day today. 
</P>
<P>
 But, wait, why am I telling you this? If you're as omnipotent as you make 
yourself out to be, this should all be old news. Although no one who read your 
review of "Philadelphia" would know this. So, maybe it's time for you to drop 
the jaded film critic facade and admit that things aren't quite as hopeless as 
you wish they were.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'MAN'S' STORY OF INJUSTICE STILL RETAINS POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Nothing but a Man" (Monica 4-Plex, Saturdays and Sundays at 11 a.m.), one of 
the finest portraits of African American life ever made, never reached the 
audience -- or racked up the Oscar nominations -- it richly deserved when it 
was released in March, 1965.  
</P>
<P>
 It succeeds as a damning portrait of social injustice because it is first of 
all a work of art -- the unpretentious kind that's warm and real and doesn't 
call attention to itself.Director Michael Roemer and writer-cameraman Robert 
Young realized that in depicting the timeless story of a nice young couple just 
starting out, they didn't need any obvious symbolism or added message to convey 
the evils of racial inequality. 
</P>
<P>
 When Duff Anderson (Ivan Dixon) forsakes the freedom of an all-black railroad 
crew to marry a preacher's daughter and schoolteacher (Abbey Lincoln), he must 
deal with relentless humiliation by whites in his new job at a lumber mill in a 
small Southern town.  
</P>
<P>
 In telling Duff's story the filmmakers come to the inescapable conclusion that 
it is not possible for most blacks to live in the United States with dignity, a 
truth that sadly applies by and large 30 years after the film was made.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'VERMONT' A PAEAN TO VANISHING WAY OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Vermont Is for Lovers" (at the Sunset 5 Saturdays and Sundays at 11 a.m.) is 
as endearing as it is slight. Essentially, it's an improvised, low-budget -- 
try $80,000 -- romantic comedy that allows its maker, John O'Brien, a 
Harvard-educated part-time sheep farmer, to say as much about his hometown, 
Tunbridge, Vt., as it does about wedding jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 George Thrush and Marya Cohn play a pair of 30ish New Yorkers named George and 
Marya, who decide to get away from the big city to get married; they've known 
each other for two years and have lived together six months. They've settled on 
Marya's aunt's home in Tunbridge, but no sooner have they arrived in this most 
pastoral of settings then they start squabbling. George is an impassioned 
architect fascinated by old structures, but Marya soon groans, "No more covered 
bridges." 
</P>
<P>
 Wisely, they decide to give each other some space, but when George continues 
his tour of the area alone while Marya visits with her perceptive aunt (played 
by O'Brien's mother, Ann) we discover that Marya in fact could have reason to 
think twice about what she's getting into with George. He's not a bad guy, but 
he can be such a jerk, a bit smug and patronizing to the locals.  
</P>
<P>
 However, George Thrush the actor is terrific on his feet. In effect he 
interviews the various citizens he encounters. That they're doubtlessly 
familiar to O'Brien and that Thrush knows how to keep the ball rolling prevents 
the non-professionals from seeming self-conscious to a degree that's amazing. 
"Vermont Is for Lovers" demolishes the stereotype of New Englanders being 
distant and close-mouthed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrush mainly asks about the secrets of successful marriage, but gradually we 
get a larger picture, of a region superficially unchanged for a couple of 
centuries but actually on the verge of losing its ancient farmlands to 
increasing housing developments. On one level, one that's of special importance 
to O'Brien, the film is a document both of an endangered area and of O'Brien's 
neighbors, many of them elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrush and Cohn are as poised as they are natural, and so is Ann O'Brien -- so 
much so that it's hard to realize that we're watching a fictional narrative. 
And O'Brien the cinematographer has made "Vermont Is for Lovers" look as good 
as the story he tells so well.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'TIME' A MEDITATION ON MORTALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ross McElwee is a documentarian of a very special sort. Although he's made 
movies about subjects like Cape Canaveral and the Berlin Wall, his flair is for 
the kind of self-examining "personal" film that, to the untutored eye, 
resembles a home movie. "Sherman's March," his surprise art-house success seven 
years ago, was made on the heels of a breakup with his girlfriend as he 
followed the route of Sherman's march on Atlanta. The film was engagingly 
desultory and sweet-spirited and became a cult hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The cult hasn't really gone to his head. "Time Indefinite" (at the Laemmle's 
Sunset-5 for an indefinite weekend run) doesn't try to canonize McElwee's 
latest exploits. It simply follows his life in the recent past as he attends a 
family reunion in Charlotte, N.C., is married, and endures a series of 
unforeseen sorrows. 
</P>
<P>
 What starts out as a jaunty, dawdling jape becomes a kind of meditation on 
mortality. But McElwee doesn't make you wince at his seriousness. His 
bafflement at what is going on in his life is a genuine, unadorned response to 
tragedy; you don't feel as if he's exploiting his ill fortune. (For a 
self-documentarian like McElwee, that would have seemed really smarmy.) And 
there's an element of mystery in what he does. He keeps the camera going in his 
movies during all manner of events -- from his meeting a blind date to 
accompanying his wife to the gynecologist.  
</P>
<P>
 He's aware, as his friend Charleen tells him, that he's using the camera as a 
way to deny reality, and yet for McElwee movie-making is also a way of 
heightening experience. (That's what makes him a true filmmaker.) He is rarely 
observed by us in this film -- he exists primarily in voice-over narration -- 
and yet he's the consciousness of everything that we see. "Time Indefinite" is 
a one-of-a-kind movie because McElwee himself seems one-of-a-kind. 
</P>
<P>
 'Time Indefinite' 
</P>
<P>
 A First Run Features release. Directed, produced, filmed, sound recorded and 
edited by Ross McElwee. Running time: 1 hour, 57 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Times rated: Mature. Times guidelines: includes female nudity and a 
gynecological exam.

RESPONDING TO GATES' MOST RECENT DEPARTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm so disappointed that Chief Daryl Gates is leaving KFI radio ("Daryl Gates 
on Show's End: 'I Have Real Mixed Emotions,' " Dec. 30). He brought a touch of 
class to a station that tends to cater to the crude and sleazy at times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chief was always so gracious and charming to his callers, even those who 
were rude and insulting. I used to wish he would tell some of them where to go, 
but he was always such a great gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope Chief Gates accepts one of the television offers. He's so handsome; it 
will be nice to see him as well as hear him.

CESAR ROMERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All I heard was "Romero" as I turned on the radio. "No, it can't be," I 
thought. "Romero, dead at 86," the announcer continued.Why couldn't I believe 
that Cesar Romero was dead? Because every time I saw him I saw a very youthful, 
handsome man who got better as he aged! 
</P>
<P>
 As an entertainer, I had the pleasure of seeing him at functions at which I 
was engaged to sing. He was so popular with everyone connected with show 
business that a party without him was not a party. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was a star, he was simply a down-to-earth human being. To me, 
Cesar Romero was a very special person who will be greatly missed.

DICTEROW'S SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed reading your recent profile of violinist Harold Dicterow, his family 
and his many years of service to the Los Angeles Philharmonic ("47 Years of 
Playing 2nd Fiddle," Dec. 28). As past concertmaster of the L.A. Doctors 
Symphony Orchestra -- to whose charitable activities the Dicterow family has 
contributed artistic services -- I've long felt that such articles have been 
overdue, since Los Angeles boasts one of the richest concentrations of fine 
musicians in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the musician-artist such as Harold Dicterow who provides the muscle and 
esprit de corps of every musical organization. Nobody said it better than 
Leopold Mozart, who wrote to his son during rehearsals of "Idomeneo" (Dec. 25, 
1780): 
</P>
<P>
 "For I know your style of composition -- it requires unusually close attention 
from the players of every type of instrument; and to keep the whole orchestra 
at such a pitch of industry and alertness for a least three hours is no joke."

THE JAZZ SINGER

<TEXT>
<P>
 To answer Leonard Feather's questions, "Where have all the great jazz singers 
gone?" and "Where are the new jazz singers coming from?" ("We Need a Unique 
Stylist, Not a Clone," Dec. 25), the finest female jazz singer I know of is 
alive and well and right here in Southern California.Her name is Stephanie 
Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience is held spellbound as soon as the first notes are sung. But she 
doesn't just sing a lyric -- she gets inside of it and lives it. 
</P>
<P>
 She sings in Los Angeles and Orange counties, often accompanied by Dave 
Mackay, at such places as Leows Santa Monica, Lunaria, Jazz Bakery and others.

WHAT HUMANS CAN DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Gritten's "Growing Into the Role" (Jan. 6) contains wording I feel 
compelled to address. In his article on actor Ralph Fiennes, who plays Nazi 
work-camp commandant Amon Goeth in Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List," 
Gritten says, "It is almost impossible to square his demeanor with that of Amon 
Goeth, a man capable of randomly shooting Jewish prisoners with a rifle from 
the balcony of his villa overlooking the work camp." 
</P>
<P>
 As Maya Angelou has said, "I am human, therefore nothing human is beyond me." 
The point is that it was not what the Nazis were "capable" of doing (or what 
the world was capable of ignoring), it was what was done. Gritten would have 
more accurately served had he noted that Goeth was a man who randomly shot 
Jewish prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 The distinction between what we are capable of and what we actually do is an 
important one that lies at the heart of the unfathomable questions that 
surround the Holocaust.

BARNEY'S NEW CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If they weren't so pathetic, I would be laughing at the charges made by the 
Rev. Joseph Chambers, a Free Pentecostal pastor who thinks the kid's show 
"Barney & Friends" fosters a belief in the occult and promotes pedophilia and 
homosexuality ("Barney, a Dinosaur Demon? Pastor Says He's Too New Age," View, 
Dec. 24). These charges are even more preposterous than the charge from similar 
circles that "Sesame Street" characters Bert and Ernie are a gay couple. 
</P>
<P>
 What the right-wing fundamentalists really object to is not Barney and "Sesame 
Street" but the fact that they're carried on PBS, the network that the right 
loves to hate. They dislike such current-events shows as "Frontline," which is 
often critical of government policies and action, especially during the Reagan 
Administration, and such science shows as "Nova" and "Nature" that treat 
evolution as scientific fact. Attacking these children's shows is their way of 
getting even.

PRENATAL CARE CUT URGED FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson proposed Friday to end prenatal health services for illegal 
immigrant women and shift some money to prenatal and well-baby care programs 
for low-income California families. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the plan, which is contained in Wilson's proposed 1994-95 budget, 
reacted with anger and surprise, saying Wilson was pitting one group of needy 
pregnant women against another. They predicted a legislative fight over 
Wilson's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is a major policy shift for Wilson, who has always argued that 
the health benefits of prenatal care pay for themselves because unhealthy 
mothers and babies pose huge potential costs for the health system. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous studies have shown that prenatal care -- including counseling on 
nutrition, warnings about the dangers of substance abuse and standard medical 
checkups -- can reduce the risk of low-weight babies and premature deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-born children of illegal immigrant women are U.S. citizens and thus 
the responsibility of the state, which must pay medical and other expenses. 
Delivery costs for low income women are paid by the state because it is 
regarded as emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
 Long and expensive stays in pediatric intensive care and children born with 
learning and other disabilities are some of the problems linked to inadequate 
prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Administration officials claim that there is not enough money to 
pay for prenatal care for all needy women. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance officials estimate that the state would save $92 million by canceling 
prenatal care for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money saved by cutting off care to illegal immigrants would be 
used to shore up another prenatal program, Access for Infants and Mothers, 
which provides prenatal and well-baby care for uninsured Californians. Created 
by Wilson, AIM has been so popular that it is expected to cut off enrollment of 
new women Feb. 1 unless it gets an infusion of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he will ask the Legislature to pass emergency legislation to end 
payments to illegal immigrants in time to meet the Feb. 1 cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Nelson, a spokeswoman for the state Health and Welfare Agency, said: 
"In this budget there are a lot of tough choices. When you are looking at the 
choice between providing prenatal care to legal residents who are low income 
versus undocumented immigrants, the choice is clear." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "The governor has made the choice that what we need to do is make 
sure the people who are legally in the state have access to these kinds of 
services versus providing them to undocumented immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's plan took longtime budget watchers by surprise. "It is hard to 
understand. These prenatal programs have always produced huge savings. It 
really is penny-wise and pound-foolish," said Marjorie Swartz, a consultant 
with the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, where about two-thirds of the state health care dollars 
going to illegal immigrant care wind up, the proposal could have a major 
impact. Prenatal services for thousands of women could be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Kersey, who operates a maternal and child health advocacy program in Los 
Angeles, said she was surprised because prenatal programs had always been part 
of Wilson's health policy agenda, called Healthy Start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked. The state just spent millions of dollars on outreach programs to 
pull people in, and now that they have it up and running they want to cut out a 
major portion of the population they were trying to serve," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Wilson) is setting himself up for a big fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Wanglin, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services, said that if state funding stops, the county would try to keep the 
program running anyway because it has proven to be cost effective. "It means we 
will have to eat it. We will go on providing care," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's budget also foresees a sharp drop in revenues in a special health 
fund built up by a surtax on cigarettes and tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
 California hospitals, which this year received $146 million in tobacco tax 
grants, would receive about $18 million less statewide. That money has been 
earmarked to help hospitals defray the costs associated with treating uninsured 
or underinsured patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials say the tobacco tax revenues have played a big role in 
allowing them to keep emergency rooms and trauma centers open.

JOBLESS RATE DIPS TO 6.4%; STATE'S LEVEL RISES SLIGHTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. unemployment inched down to 6.4% in December, from a revised 6.5% in 
November, giving the gradually improving national economy its lowest jobless 
rate in nearly three years, the federal government reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate bucked the national trend, edging up to 8.7% from 
8.6% the month before, yet analysts saw signs that the deterioration of the 
state economy is easing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping for the economy to stabilize by the spring, and at this point, 
the odds are looking pretty good," said Ted Gibson, an economist for the 
California Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of 1993, California's jobless rate averaged 9.2%, its worst showing 
since 1983, when the average was 9.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobless rate statistics were accompanied by a separate report, the 
government's closely watched survey of employer payrolls, that showed a 183,000 
increase in jobs nationally last month. While the employment increase fell 
below the expectations of many economists and investors, analysts said it still 
reflected a steady recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the moderate job gain calmed fears on Wall Street that the 
inflation-wary Federal Reserve would act soon to raise interest rates to keep 
the economy from overheating. Relieved investors pushed up the prices of both 
bonds and stocks, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 16.89 points 
to close at 3,820.77. 
</P>
<P>
 If job growth nationally had been much stronger last month, "the Federal 
Reserve would have been very, very nervous" and probably would have moved to 
boost interest rates, said Joseph A. Wahed, chief economist for Wells Fargo 
Bank in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The current breadth and pace of the recovery, Wahed added, "is exactly what 
the doctor ordered." 
</P>
<P>
 Katharine Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, noted that 
the nation's job growth came despite layoffs at many of the nation's large 
corporations. "This is cheering news in light of the major restructuring 
occurring in the economy," she said in testimony before the Joint Economic 
Committee of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of the newly created jobs, however, has been a continuing concern 
among economists, and December's figures did not erase those worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the new jobs came in the service sector, including temporary positions 
and lower-paying jobs in such areas as the retailing and restaurant trades. 
Only 2,000 of the new jobs came in manufacturing, generally a higher-paying 
segment of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many economists had expected the economy to add about 220,000 jobs, 
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich lowered Wall Street's expectations Thursday 
when he took the unusual step of predicting an employment gain of between 
160,000 and 200,000. His remarks triggered a rally in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a Clinton Administration spokesman acknowledged that investors may 
have believed that Reich based his prediction on inside information, but he 
noted that the labor secretary had not seen the report in advance. 
Nevertheless, the spokesman expressed regret over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6.4% in December, U.S. joblessness hit its lowest level since January, 
1991, when it was 6.3%. November's jobless rate originally was reported as 
6.4%, too, before being revised to 6.5% to account for seasonal trends. 
</P>
<P>
 The national unemployment rate has been on a downward trend since June, 1992, 
when it hit a recessionary peak of 7.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's next unemployment report, due out Feb. 4, could show a higher 
level of joblessness even if the labor market improves this month. A new 
government questionnaire and revised data-collecting techniques taking effect 
this month are expected to boost the reported unemployment level by about 
four-tenths of a percentage point, Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
 For hard-hit California, economists were encouraged by the relatively small 
employment loss -- 3,400 jobs -- reported in the December payroll survey. Over 
the entire year, California lost 151,100 jobs according to the survey, 
amounting to nearly 13,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the state would have squeezed out a small employment increase in 
December if it had not been for the loss of 4,300 jobs in durable goods 
manufacturing, a figure reflecting continued layoffs in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also were pleased that the state's jobless rate, which fell 
dramatically in November from 9.8% in October, edged up only slightly in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, California's jobless rate remained the highest among the 11 big states. 
Next came New York, at 7.6%, and Michigan, at 7.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobless rate for Los Angeles County -- a figure generally considered 
volatile by economists because of the relatively small sampling on which it is 
based -- fell to 8.9% in December from 9.4% in November. The county rate, which 
peaked in February at 11.2%, has declined three months in a row and compares to 
a jobless level of 9.8% in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 December's jobless rate for the county reflected employment of nearly 3.97 
million, up 33,000 from the month before but down from 44,000 from a year 
earlier. The number of people out of work totaled 387,000, a decline of 23,000 
from November and 50,000 from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay D. Horowitz, a labor market analyst for the California Employment 
Development Dept., attributed the employment gain mainly to temporary Christmas 
season hiring by retailers. He described himself as "cautiously optimistic" 
that the local economy is on the mend, but said the improvement in the December 
figures "is largely the result of the holiday season." 
</P>
<P>
 The local figures, unlike the national and state statistics, are not adjusted 
for seasonal trends. 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; SCIENCE OF POWER AND WEAKNESS; IN THE NAME OF THE COLD WAR, 
RESEARCHERS TOOK THE DISADVANTAGED AND MADE THEM SUBJECTS OF RISKY RADIATION 
TESTS. QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT THE GOALS, THE GREED AND THE HUMANITY.

<P>
 They feared the threat of atomic war, of hostile superpowers firing nuclear 
missiles over the horizon, forever changing the lives of innocent civilians. 
But they never expected the radiation to come from their own government. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Inupiat of northwest Alaska, it came from the caribou, who got it from 
the lichen, which absorbed it from the radioactive debris scattered across the 
tundra by scientists. For a group of cancer patients in Cincinnati -- mostly 
poor, mostly black -- it came in the form of "treatments" administered by an 
eminent researcher in radiation. For children at the Fernald School for the 
Mentally Retarded, it came along with their breakfast cereal, served up by 
researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 From Alaska to Boston, one of the Cold War's most chilling legacies is finally 
coming to light, dragged into the open by the very agency that zealously 
safeguarded the nation's nuclear secrets for decades. At the direction of 
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, her department has vowed to "come clean" on the 
human radiation experiments conducted under the sponsorship of the federal 
government over nearly three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the shocking crudeness of some of the experiments lies another 
injustice: The subjects of the government's secretive studies were not just 
guinea pigs in a series of potentially lethal experiments. Many were drawn from 
the ranks of society's dispossessed, either by virtue of their race, age, 
income or intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, some were victims twice over: Already socially disadvantaged, they 
were used by a government and medical establishment that appeared to value 
science and prestige and military supremacy more highly than the rights of 
individuals on the fringes of society. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture that is emerging is one that, as a government scientist familiar 
with the testing put it in 1950, "has a little of the Buchenwald touch" -- a 
reference to the Nazi concentration camp in which grotesque experiments were 
conducted on prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1945 until the mid-1970s -- years of concern about the Soviet Union's 
military intentions -- the federal government underwrote a number of 
experiments that involved exposing human subjects to highly radioactive 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
 In several experiments, scientists injected toxic plutonium into gravely 
injured hospital patients. In another, they exposed indigent cancer patients to 
whole-body radiation 10 times more powerful than that recommended as treatment 
for leukemia. They dangled prison inmates' testicles in irradiated water, and 
served poor pregnant women a drink containing radioactive iron filings. 
Although the research proceeded independently at different times and in 
different places, all of it ultimately was financed with tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 As the government and the scientific community scour files for evidence of 
such experiments, they are confronting ethical issues as old as the Hippocratic 
oath and as recent as the Nuremberg Code of 1947, which articulated 
international standards of informed consent. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, O'Leary has discussed details of only one of the experiments. Others 
have come to light as a result of congressional hearings or independent 
investigations. Altogether, information involving more than 30 experiments has 
been disclosed, and government officials acknowledge that many more are likely 
to be unearthed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those cases for which specific information is available, roughly a dozen 
involve subjects drawn from the ranks of the disadvantaged. Ruth Faden, a 
medical ethicist at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University who will chair the 
review panel created by O'Leary, said "it would not be surprising" if the full 
body of experiments was to show a significant pattern of abuse of vulnerable 
and dispossessed people. "There is a pattern already existing" of such abuses 
in experiments outside of the area of radiation studies, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, most of the experiments were conducted at a time when far less 
was known about the long-term hazards of radiation exposure, and they are being 
judged by far more sophisticated standards than were available to scientists at 
the time. Even so, the revelations raise disturbing questions about the 
subjects chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the researchers understand that some of their experiments might be 
ethically questionable? Some of the principals have defended the studies as 
reasonable and necessary in light of the apparent threat of nuclear warfare. 
Today's critics say the choice of subjects suggests scientists knew even then 
that their research might not stand up to public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best evidence," said Stanley Chesley, an attorney involved in several 
radiation compensation cases, "is that they were doing it to poor and black 
people. You didn't see them doing it at the Mayo Clinic." 
</P>
<P>
 Did they know their experiments might harm their subjects? A 1963 memorandum 
obtained by The Times suggests that in at least one case, scientists strongly 
suspected that it would. 
</P>
<P>
 Neatly hand-printed at the bottom of a proposal to irradiate the testicles of 
some Northwest prison inmates are the words of Dr. Charles W. Edington, a 
radiological expert who later participated in the study: "I'm for support at 
the requested level, as long as we are not liable. I worry about possible 
carcinogenic effects of such treatments." 
</P>
<P>
 Were prospective subjects made to understand the known or likely effects of 
the proposed procedures? And if so, did they have a realistic option of 
declining? In several cases, the answer clearly appears to be no. 
</P>
<P>
 Faden said the independent panel established by O'Leary will focus on the 
standards used in choosing subjects and on the extent of informed consent by 
participants. In examining those issues, Faden said, members will consider 
whether Cold War anxiety -- the sense of military urgency that clearly prompted 
support for many studies -- is a valid excuse for any abuses that occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 In the view of some medical ethicists, that question already has been 
answered. "We heard that defense, and heard it loudly at the Nuremberg trials, 
and we rejected it," said Arthur Caplan, author of "When Medicine Went Mad: 
Bioethics and the Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
 "It just won't wash to invoke it now. In fact, I find it an even less 
persuasive defense now, because these people didn't experiment on themselves or 
their families. They said, 'Let's round up the insane, the inane, the disabled, 
debilitated and vulnerable, and experiment on them.' They rounded them up and 
put them on the altar of the Cold War," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the experiments already documented by congressional studies and 
independent investigators, a few follow the tradition of scientists 
experimenting on themselves, their colleagues and even their loved ones: In one 
study at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico, 57 consenting 
adults -- including the wife of the principal investigator -- were fed tiny 
spheres of radioactive material to see how quickly it would pass through their 
intestinal tracts. 
</P>
<P>
 But as investigators comb the scattered records of government-sponsored 
experiments, they may find a disproportionate number of anonymous subjects who 
were disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them were pregnant women who sought free health care at the Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center in Tennessee. In 1945 and 1946, doctors at Vanderbilt 
gave 751 women in the later stages of pregnancy a radioactive tonic to see how 
they would metabolize radioactivity and to determine safe levels of radiation 
exposure. The doses -- 30 times higher than normal environmental radiation -- 
were not considered safe at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years starting in 1961, researchers at MIT injected 20 subjects, ages 
63 to 83, with radioactive Radium-224 and Thorium-234. The subjects, drawn from 
the Age Center of New England, had volunteered to participate in "a variety of 
research projects on aging," according to a 1986 report. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time the search for victims takes investigators to the edges of 
American society, it is taking them to the pinnacles of medicine and academia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important field of investigation today is that of attempting to 
understand and mitigate the possible effects of nuclear warfare upon human 
beings," Eugene Saenger, the University of Cincinnati radiologist who conducted 
whole-body radiation experiments on low-income subjects, told an interviewer in 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a person who takes the defense of our country very seriously," Saenger 
was quoted as saying in "The Great American Bomb Machine," a book by Roger 
Rapoport. "I think it is important to find out the kind of things we are 
learning in this study."  
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't they put their bodies where their patriotism was instead of 
applying for grants from the Atomic Energy Commission?" asked Arjun Makhijani, 
president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, a watchdog 
group. "This whole thing was about power and money. That's why it was easy to 
use subjects who were disempowered." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials believe the government's far-flung program of radiation 
experimentation, often involving unwilling or unwitting subjects, may have left 
an indelible mark on the lives of about 800 people and their families. And 
those numbers could swell as the Energy Department combs through about 32 
million pages of information -- a stack of documents three miles high -- 
related to the nuclear weapon and energy program. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next several months, the search will take federal investigators into 
prisons -- considered by medical ethicists today to be one of the most 
questionable venues for medical experiments. It will reach into nursing homes 
and schools for the mentally disabled, into busy city hospitals where the 
nation's poor are treated without charge, and into Native American communities 
scattered throughout Alaska and the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the experimental subjects -- like a group of comatose brain cancer 
victims injected with uranium -- were critically ill at the time that doctors 
proposed untested radiation treatments on them. Others, like the Inupiat of 
northwest Alaska, were so perfectly adapted to their frigid environment that 
scientists were interested in determining whether white soldiers could handle 
the cold as well as the Inupiat. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others belong to groups placed under the extended guardianship of the 
government, making it much easier to monitor the results of experimentation 
over an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we were used as guinea pigs," said Ray Koonuk, an Inupiat from 
Point Hope, near where scientists in 1962 seeded the tundra with as much as 10 
curies of radioactive debris. In the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor accident 
of 1979, by comparison, approximately 15 curies of radioactive material far 
less toxic than that apparently used in Alaska was said to have been released 
into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we just didn't have very much knowledge of what was going on in the 
outside world, what kind of chemicals were in the bombs. We feel taken 
advantage of," Koonuk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other subsistence hunters in the Point Hope area, Koonuk hunted and 
gathered bird eggs in the unmarked experimental area with his grandfather, who 
is dying of cancer, and with a friend who died of cancer at 36. After the issue 
was raised last spring by Alaskan lawmakers, the Clinton Administration 
promised to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just frustrated and scared, asking, 'Am I next?' " said Koonuk. 
"There's no trust any more in the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, since the revelations began emerging in early December, the sense of 
fear and distrust seems to have spread as insidiously as radioactive fallout 
after a nuclear blast. The Energy Department's switchboards have been jammed 
with about 10,000 calls per day. Many of the calls are from people who probably 
received standard medical radiation treatments in recent decades but fear they 
may have been subjects of additional tests without their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Their suspicions are understandable: At the time the experiments were 
conducted, many subjects were told little or nothing about the scientific 
objectives and possible effects. At the University of Cincinnati, many 
terminally ill subjects in one experiment were told that an experimental dose 
of full-body radiation was part of their "treatment." Since patients in the 
study had a median IQ of 87, it is unclear whether further explanation of the 
study's risks -- if any -- would have satisfied modern-day standards of 
informed consent. An IQ of 100 is considered to be average. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1946-47 study conducted at the University of Rochester in New York, six 
patients were injected with increasing doses of a radioactive concoction in an 
effort to determine what levels of radiation would damage the kidneys. One 
patient was homeless and consequently "agreed willingly to enter the metabolic 
unit for special studies," according to study reports. And three subjects were 
alcoholics -- one of whom was admitted to the study while in a "hallucinatory 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 Most subjects received little or no recompense for their participation: In 
1957, the Eskimos and Athabascans of northern Alaska -- few of whom even spoke 
English at the time -- received an apple and an orange for allowing Army 
doctors to inject radioactive Iodine-131 into them. 
</P>
<P>
 For a decade starting in 1963, 131 state prisoners in Washington and Oregon 
penitentiaries were paid $5 per month to allow scientists to irradiate their 
genitals. The bizarre experiment was designed to gauge what levels of radiation 
exposure soldiers, astronauts and nuclear production workers could tolerate 
without reproductive side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 James Daughterty, a prisoner who participated in the experiments, told a 
researcher in 1980 that the money "meant an awful lot at the time," when, 
without income, he had no cigarettes and none of "the little necessities." 
</P>
<P>
 "You hate to be without toothpaste or anything," Daughterty told researcher 
Arnold Levinson, whose notes are on file at the Center for Investigative 
Journalism in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades later, the Clinton Administration is considering the possibility 
of providing compensation to some of the victims -- at levels far above the 
cost of toothpaste and cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts warn that a comprehensive program of compensation for experiment 
victims could involve payments of hundreds of millions of dollars, increase 
cynicism toward the government and open a Pandora's box of demands from those 
who feel they are victims of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration officials insist the issue could be a political boon -- a 
sure-fire way to expose the wrongs of past administrations and a dramatic 
demonstration of President Clinton's "putting people first" philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Energy Secretary O'Leary has said that without a massive effort to 
flush out such nuclear secrets, there will be no redemption for the government 
-- or her department -- in the jaded eyes of American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have got to restore the ability of the government to do good things," said 
Dr. Tara O'Toole, the assistant energy secretary for environment, safety and 
health who is overseeing the review of the experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means trust, and that means we have to be honest and tell the truth 
about what happened," O'Toole said. "We are not under any illusion that this 
will be easy or pleasant, but I don't see any alternative. This is the right 
thing to do."

VIACOM, BLOCKBUSTER TO MERGE IN PARAMOUNT BID; BUSINESS: COMPANIES WILL SWEETEN 
CASH OFFER IN AN ATTEMPT TO DERAIL QVC TAKEOVER OF ENTERTAINMENT GIANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a cliffhanger worthy of a Hollywood box office hit, Viacom Inc. and 
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. agreed to merge Friday as part of an 
eleventh-hour gambit to derail a marriage between QVC Network and Paramount 
Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed merger -- the result of marathon negotiations over the last 
three days -- Viacom-Blockbuster said it will sweeten the cash portion of its 
bid to $105 a share, or a total of $6.5 billion, for 50.1% of Paramount's 
stock. The move was the most dramatic yet in the 4-month-old takeover brawl for 
the entertainment giant that includes Paramount Pictures and Simon & Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also one of the most extraordinary actions in U.S. corporate history. 
Analysts on Friday were scratching their heads to determine the ramifications, 
since there appears to be no precedent for two companies as large as Viacom and 
Blockbuster merging in order to facilitate a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom, which owns MTV and Nickelodeon, and Blockbuster -- the highly 
profitable home video giant -- valued their stock-swap merger at $8.4 billion, 
based on Friday's closing stock prices. If they succeed in acquiring Paramount, 
it would create an entertainment behemoth with a stock market value of $26 
billion, annual revenue approaching $10 billion and about $1.4 billion a year 
in cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite raising the cash offer for Paramount, the total value of the deal is 
estimated at about $9.7 billion. Many traders and analysts reacted angrily to 
the new bid because even though its cash portion tops QVC's $92-a-share bid, 
the overall value of the Viacom-Blockbuster bid is lower than QVC's offer of 
$9.9 billion. Complicating the takeover battle is the fact that the stock 
prices fluctuate daily. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the merger agreement initially set off confusion on Wall Street over 
whether the Viacom-Blockbuster bid would reset the clock another 10 days or 
whether some Paramount shareholders would go ahead with plans to offer their 
shares to QVC, the home shopping channel headed by former Hollywood mogul Barry 
Diller. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount said Friday its board would meet next week to consider the 
Viacom-Blockbuster bid. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC on Friday charged that Viacom's new offer violates bidding procedures 
previously agreed to by the parties in the Paramount fight. On those grounds, 
QVC's lawyers held that Viacom's new offer does not "trigger a new round of 
bidding," implying that QVC might seek a legal challenge to the latest move. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC said it will decide over the weekend about extending its tender offer, but 
one source close to the company said it had no plans to raise its bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viacom-Blockbuster merger would create a colossus in its own right, 
regardless of whether it wins Paramount. Indeed, some industry observers 
believe Viacom Chairman Sumner M. Redstone is getting an insurance policy in 
Blockbuster should his bid for Paramount fail. Blockbuster Chairman H. Wayne 
Huizenga, meanwhile, is said to be motivated by a need to expand beyond his 
core business of video stores, which many believe have a limited future. 
</P>
<P>
 Some on Wall Street, however, questioned whether Blockbuster had erred by 
essentially putting itself on the market by agreeing to be acquired by Viacom. 
Since Blockbuster is technically incorporated in Delaware and the company has 
agreed to give up control to Redstone, then based on recent Delaware court 
rulings Blockbuster is required to begin auctioning itself off to the highest 
bidder, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Viacom on its own was offering $85 per share for 51% of Paramount, 
compared to $92 per share from QVC. Both companies also were offering a package 
of securities for the remaining 49%.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that the "blended value" of the revised Viacom-Blockbuster 
offer -- the combined value of cash and stock -- was less than QVC's tender 
offer currently on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lower bid," said Furman Selz analyst John Tinker. "But it's a greater 
proportion of cash. So QVC will probably have to increase its cash portion a 
little bit. The real issue is Viacom and Blockbuster now have another 10 days 
to figure how far they really want to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Reiff, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., said that "there is no 
question that Viacom has a higher cash bid. But it's only 50% of the company. 
So the real value is in the back end, and we'll know about that next week when 
trading begins again." 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom class A stock fell 88 cents to close at $46.13 in trading Friday on the 
American Stock Exchange, while Viacom class B stock fell $1.75 to close at $41. 
Paramount rose 75 cents to close at $79.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, and 
QVC climbed $1.25 in over-the-counter trading. Blockbuster closed at $28.38 a 
share, down $1.50, on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading in Viacom and Blockbuster stocks was halted before the announcement 
was made Friday afternoon, making it difficult for analysts to calculate the 
value of the new bid based on market reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the merger agreement, Blockbuster shareholders will receive 0.08 of a 
share of Viacom class A stock, 0.60615 of a share of Viacom class B stock and 
one "variable common right" for each share of Blockbuster that is convertible 
to class B shares. 
</P>
<P>
 If Viacom-Blockbuster is successful in acquiring Paramount -- the merger is 
not contingent on the tender offer -- Blockbuster has agreed to invest an 
additional $1.5 billion in Viacom through the purchase of Viacom class B 
shares. The companies said that will provide Paramount shareholders a richer 
cash reward without diluting their stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom's Redstone, who previously said that the bidding for Paramount had 
reached "Never, Never Land," defended the decision to raise the cash portion of 
the offer Friday on the grounds that the extra money was coming from its merger 
partner, Blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Viacom has not had to add one more cent from our last offer in order to 
increase the cash component," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone said the proposed merger builds upon Viacom and Blockbuster's shared 
vision of becoming a broad-based entertainment giant for the anticipated 
technological revolution in interactive television and video on demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone would still control about 60% of a merged Viacom and Blockbuster, and 
would hold about 30% of the equity. Blockbuster's Huizenga would apparently 
take a secondary role. 
</P>
<P>
 Unclear is what role, if any, Paramount Chief Executive Martin S. Davis would 
play in a combined Viacom-Blockbuster-Paramount entity. Although Davis had been 
tagged to become chief executive officer under a Viacom-Paramount merger, there 
was no mention of him in the Viacom-Blockbuster announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis "understands the situation a lot, and whether there is a role for him to 
play is something we will give a lot of thought to," Redstone said. "But no 
matter what the outcome, (Viacom chief executive Frank Biondi) will be C.E.O." 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of a full-scale merger, first raised last summer, came up again in 
late December, according to sources, with talks led by Huizenga and Blockbuster 
Vice Chairman Steven Berrard on Blockbuster's side and Redstone and Biondi on 
Viacom's side. Berrard and Biondi talked briefly about the deal over the 
holidays in Arizona, where both happened to be vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations rose to a frenzy this week, continuing nonstop from Wednesday 
until the deal was signed Friday afternoon. Most participants got little or no 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult issues eventually came down to control and price, as they 
do with most mergers. In an interview, however, Berrard declined to single out 
any specific hurdle, saying much of the time was spent on "mechanical and 
procedural" issues over what type of Viacom shares Blockbuster stockholders 
would receive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Huizenga is taking a back seat to Redstone, an unusual move for 
the Florida entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 Some executives who know Huizenga well said they were surprised that he would 
do that, and suggested it might not be so easy for Huizenga and Redstone to 
work side by side because of their strong personalities. But Berrard said the 
two get along very well. 
</P>
<P>
 While Redstone will have more than 60% of the voting control of the combined 
company, Blockbuster shareholders will own about 60% of the equity and about 
50% if the Paramount deal goes through, Berrard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in Hollywood have speculated that the Viacom deal amounts to an 
acknowledgment by Blockbuster that its video-rental business -- however 
profitable it is now -- has a limited life with technological advances on the 
horizon that would allow movie watchers to call up vast numbers of films from 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster's Berrard, however, said the fear of becoming obsolete was not a 
motivating factor.

</P>
<P>
 Viacom-Blockbuster and QVC are both offering cash amounts for 50.1% of 
Paramount stock and packages of securities for the remaining stake. Because the 
packages of securities are tied to each bidder's stock price, they fluctuate in 
value as the stock prices change. But the cash component represents a fixed 
value for Paramount's shareholders. Although the current QVC bid is valued at 
$9.9 billion against Viacom-Blockbuster's new offer of $9.7 billion, the cash 
component of the Viacom-Blockbuster offer is 14% higher than QVC's cash bid.

 Gov. Pete Wilson proposed a $55.4-billion state budget Friday that would slash 
aid to the poor and shift new responsibilities for health and welfare programs 
from the state to local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he wants to boost funding for prisons -- to keep pace with the 
increasing number of inmates -- and give the public schools enough money to 
keep up with enrollment, if not inflation. Community college and university 
students would face fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget would not raise taxes. It includes the modest tax breaks Wilson has 
proposed for new businesses and families earning less than $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a constitutional requirement that he present a balanced budget, 
Wilson's spending plan has a $3-billion hole, which he hopes to fill with a 
massive, unprecedented infusion of aid from the federal government. Most of 
this is money Wilson says the state pays for services to illegal immigrants, 
which he argues is a federal obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 If that money does not materialize by June, Wilson will have to raise taxes or 
find spending cuts totaling nearly 8% of his general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Epstein, President Clinton's liaison for California issues, said Clinton 
sympathizes with Wilson's concerns. But Epstein said the Administration and 
Congress are constrained by a deficit-reduction law that requires every federal 
spending increase to be offset by a reduction elsewhere in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any expectation that there's going to be large new amounts of money is pretty 
unrealistic in light of the tight federal limits we're living under," Epstein 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said his spending plan reflected problems caused by the state's 
"deepest, longest depression" since the 1930s. California, he said, has lost 
870,000 jobs since May, 1990, and 170,000 in the past year. At the same time, 
school enrollments, prison population, and welfare rolls have been growing. 
</P>
<P>
 By relying so heavily on the uncertain prospect of federal assistance, the 
Republican governor, in an election year, in effect is pointing the finger at 
the Democrats who control Congress and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he is counting on receiving about $600 million more in increased 
federal aid for welfare and Medi-Cal, the health program for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also said he wants the federal government to reimburse the state 
for the cost of educating the 400,000 illegal immigrants he says are in the 
public schools, and for the cost of providing emergency medical care to the 
undocumented population and imprisoning illegal immigrants convicted of 
felonies in California. The total immigration tab would come to $2.3 billion, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the federal government has never acknowledged responsibility for those 
costs and, based on recent votes in Congress, seems unlikely to do so now. 
Wilson last year asked for $1.45 billion but the state received just $324 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's argument that the money California spends on immigrants would be 
better spent on the state's legal residents has been used in Washington to 
defeat his proposals for more federal money, Epstein noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it was presented in the Congress last year is that you're taking 
money away from programs for legal U.S. residents throughout the country to pay 
for illegal residents in a handful of states," Epstein said. "That's obviously 
not popular if you're from Montana or Idaho." 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, Wilson has postponed much of the state's budget debate until May, 
when he will present a revised plan that considers more recent economic trends 
and reacts to any signals Washington sends about its intention to aid the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Constitution requires the Legislature to pass the budget by June 15. 
The fiscal year begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Most legislative leaders, who have been trying to keep good relations with 
Wilson, ducked questions about his budget on Friday. Assemblyman John 
Vasconcellos, the Santa Clara Democrat who is the Assembly's lead budget 
writer, said the governor was unrealistic in his reliance on federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the fantasy flies," Vasconcellos said. "I'll do all I can to support 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, questioned by reporters, refused to say what he would propose if the 
federal government failed to come through with the money he says California 
deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have to make decisions that nobody wants to make," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor added: "The entire budget is dependent on getting immigration 
aid. We are making no bones about that fact. We are insisting on what is not 
just equity, it is a necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he expects California to join a lawsuit that the state of Florida 
intends to file against the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 If enacted as Wilson proposes it, the state's general fund budget would 
decline from $39.3 billion this year to $38.8 billion next year, a 1.4% drop. 
But year-to-year comparisons are distorted by the proposed infusion of federal 
money and the shift of programs to local government. Both actions would show up 
on paper as reductions in state spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The real cost of the services Wilson is proposing -- ignoring the funding 
shifts -- is about 7% greater than what the state is spending this year, 
according to figures supplied by the Finance Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Capitol, business groups applauded Wilson's budget while advocates 
for social programs criticized the spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry McCarthy, president of the business-backed California Taxpayers Assn., 
said Wilson's budget is a good one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It proposes changes that are designed to improve the economy while increasing 
accountability for the delivery of essential government services," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children Now, a group that lobbies for programs for the young, said Wilson's 
proposal goes against his stated desire to stress preventive programs that will 
save the state money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The budget fails to sufficiently invest in programs that can lift children 
out of poverty and provide the foundation for them to become healthy, 
contributing members of society," said James P. Steyer, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest winner in Wilson's budget is the state prison system, which would 
get a 10% increase -- about $335 million -- to handle a 7% jump in the number 
of inmates. Wilson wants to hire 3,215 more guards and support staff and open 
two new prisons in the San Joaquin Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 The governor also proposed a $2-billion prison bond measure, which would go to 
the voters either in June or November. The money would pay for the construction 
of six new state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 That proposal drew opposition from Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of 
Fresno, usually a strong ally of the governor. He said his GOP colleagues 
believe the state has too much debt already. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are unanimously opposed to any bonds for any reason," Maddy said. He 
proposed that the state rethink its policy of building prisons to house inmates 
one to a cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's budget also includes funds for about 130 new Highway Patrol officers 
and training for the first of 500 CHP officers he wants to hire and assign to 
help local police in high-crime communities. 
</P>
<P>
 These new hires still would leave the state with far fewer officers than when 
Wilson took office in 1991, his Finance Department said. Because of unfilled 
vacancies, the number of CHP officers is expected to drop from about 6,140 in 
1991 to 5,550 by the end of the current fiscal year June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 For schools, Wilson proposed enough money to keep spending from state and 
local tax dollars at the current level of about $4,220 per student. But the 
schools would lose ground to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's budget calls for a 54% fee increase for community college students, 
from $13 to $20 per unit. California State University officials already were 
planning a 24% increase, from $1,440 a year to $1,782. The system's chancellor 
has said that fee increase should stand even though Cal State would get less 
under Wilson's budget -- a 3.9% increase -- than it had counted on. 
</P>
<P>
 University of California President Jack W. Peltason said Friday that he was 
"grateful" to Wilson for a 3.2% increase, although it was far short of the 8% 
he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up the difference, UC officials said they will ask the Board of 
Regents later this month to approve a $620 fee increase on all university 
students, who now pay an average of $3,727 a year. They will also ask approval 
for a $2,000 "differential" fee on students who will enroll next fall in 
professional schools for medicine, law, veterinary medicine, dentistry and 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is also seeking a $1.6-billion bond measure to build elementary and 
secondary schools and a $900-million bond measure to finance construction of 
new university buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In health and welfare programs, Wilson revived proposals the Legislature has 
rejected each of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor proposed cutting welfare grants by 10% July 1 and another 15% six 
months later. He wants to stop giving more money to families that have 
additional children while already on welfare, and he would end payments to 
able-bodied adults after two years, a concept Clinton also is considering. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson hopes to save about $460 million a year with these proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also recommended eliminating a host of health services to poor 
adults, including dental care, psychological counseling, podiatry, and 
chiropractic and acupuncture services. This would save the state $151 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also proposed to accelerate a shift in the relationship between state 
and local government. He said his proposal would give counties more incentives 
to save money on health and social programs by giving them more of a share of 
the fiscal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the counties run the biggest welfare program -- Aid to Families 
With Dependent Children -- but pay for less than 5% of its cost. Wilson would 
increase that to nearly 25%. Similarly, in Medi-Cal, the health program for the 
poor, the county share would go from zero today to about 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson proposed giving the counties what he said would be enough additional 
money to pay for their increased share of these costs in the coming year. After 
that, the counties would face higher costs as the programs grew or save money 
if the programs shrunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also proposed repealing a key part of Proposition 117, the so-called 
Mountain Lion initiative passed by voters in 1990. Wilson said the $30 million 
annual fund for purchasing wildlife habitat was a drag on the budget the state 
can no longer afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Ralph Frammolino in Los Angeles and Carl Ingram in 
Sacramento contributed to this story. How the Money Is Spent 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a detailed look at Gov. Pete Wilson's proposed 1994-95 California 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Education (K-12 and Community Colleges). $18.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 There is enough money to allow elementary and secondary schools to keep up 
with expected increases in enrollment, but the funding would not allow school 
districts to keep pace with rising salaries and higher costs for books and 
materials. Community college students would see a 54% fee increase -- from $13 
per unit to $20. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Health and Welfare. $14.3 billion 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has called for a variety of cuts in health and welfare programs. He 
wants to reduce welfare grants to poor families -- cutting them by 10% July 1 
and another 15% six months later. He also is trying to eliminate a number of 
services available under Medi-Cal, the state and federal program providing 
health care to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Higher Education. $4.6 billion 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State system and the University of California campuses would get a 
slight increase in state funding. However, students and their families can 
expect sizable fee increases again next year as the universities try to find 
new sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Business, Transportation and Housing. $4.5 billion 
</P>
<P>
 There would be another year of small increases for this umbrella agency, which 
includes CalTrans, the department responsible for building and maintaining the 
state's network of roads and freeways. Wilson is proposing a larger increase 
for the California Highway Patrol -- adding officers to help local police. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Corrections. $3.9 billion 
</P>
<P>
 The governor is calling for a 6.6% increase in state funds for operating 
prisons and Youth Authority facilities. Wilson is also supporting the 
"three-strikes-and-you're-out" proposal that would give life sentences to 
repeat, serious offenders. He is asking for a $2 billion bond measure to build 
new prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Aid to Local Government. $3.1 billion 
</P>
<P>
 This amount includes a variety of taxes and fees collected by the state and 
passed on to local governments, such as a share of motor vehicle license fees. 
As a separate measure, Wilson wants to shift $1.1 billion in property taxes 
from schools to cities and counties for a variety of services. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Natural Resources. $1.8 billion 
</P>
<P>
 The governor is calling for an overall 3% increase for the agency that 
oversees parks, fish and game, conservation programs and water project 
operations. But not all programs fare as well as others. The parks and 
recreation budget, for example, would get a lesser amount next year under the 
Wilson proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 8. State and Consumer Services. $729 million 
</P>
<P>
 A moderate increase is proposed to run a variety of state licensing and 
consumer protection programs. Also included is the budget for the state 
Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of General Services, which 
manages public office buildings and vehicle fleets. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Environmental Protection. $577 million 
</P>
<P>
 The California Environmental Protection Agency faces an overall 9% fund cut 
under the governor's plan. The agency is responsible for the regulation of 
pesticides, cleanup of toxic dumps and reduction in air and water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Tax Relief. $438 million 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the governor and Legislature agreed to eliminate renters tax 
credits -- cash refunds for low-income taxpayers who live in rental units. But 
a variety of programs remain in place, such as the property tax exemption for 
homeowners. Proposed Spending

ELLIE NESLER GETS 10 YEARS IN COURT KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK ARAX and PATTY FULLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tuolumne County judge sentenced Ellie Nesler to 10 years in prison Friday 
for gunning down her son's accused molester in court last spring, calling the 
killing an execution showing a "high-degree of viciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 Nesler, 41, who has breast cancer, showed no emotion as Superior Court Judge 
William G. Polley pronounced what is considered a "midterm sentence." She faced 
a maximum 16 years. She will be eligible for parole in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Polley granted Nesler 15 minutes with her two children. Then bailiffs shackled 
her and led her out the back door of the courthouse to a van. She was asked by 
reporters if the sentence was fair. "Yeah," she smiled slightly. "It was fair." 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted Nesler in August of voluntary manslaughter in the death of 
35-year-old Daniel Driver, a killing that drew worldwide attention and turned 
the gold-miner's daughter into a symbol for some people besieged by crime. The 
jury determined that the single mother was legally sane when she walked into 
the Old West-style courtroom in April and shot Driver as he sat shackled at the 
defense table. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesler and her attorney, J. Tony Serra, pleaded for leniency during a 
four-hour hearing Friday, citing her advancing cancer and the welfare of her 
two children, ages 12 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't undo what I did," she told the judge. "But I don't condone what I 
did. If you send me away for a short period, I could make it. But if I'm 
sentenced to a long period I would rather die. . . . Please, your honor, give 
me a chance to give something back, to give to the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Serra asked the judge to set his client free on probation. "There's nothing 
good about this case. It's all a tragedy," he said. "The only way to make sense 
out of this is allow her to go out on probation. . . . If she dies in prison, I 
think the legend of Ellie Nesler will only be greater." 
</P>
<P>
 Polley rejected those arguments. "This crime, in fact, was an execution. The 
defendant knew full well the penalty when she shot Daniel Driver and she 
intended to pay that penalty." He called Serra's request for probation 
inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing took place April 2 during a break in a preliminary hearing to 
determine if Driver would stand trial on charges that he molested Nesler's son, 
then 6, and three other boys at a Christian camp in 1988. Driver had spent 
three months in Santa Clara County Jail in 1983 for child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, Nesler told authorities that she feared he would be set 
free without a trial. "Maybe I'm not God but I'll tell you what, I'm the 
closest thing to it," she told authorities. "I just felt he should be dead so I 
played judge and jury." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence marked perhaps the final chapter in one of the most sensational 
and resounding criminal cases in the colorful history of this Mother Lode 
region. In the days after the killing, Nesler was praised as a heroine 
frustrated by the judicial system and acting out of concern for her son, whom 
Driver allegedly threatened to not testify in the molestation case. 
</P>
<P>
 A multitude of journalists, talk show and TV movie representatives swooped 
down on this rustic area, which served as backdrop for "High Noon" and other 
Hollywood Westerns. Two banks set up Nesler defense funds and shops and 
honky-tonks along Main Street collected cash in big glass jars. T-shirts and 
bumper stickers proclaimed "Nice Shooting, Ellie." Calls of support poured in 
from across the country and Canada, Italy, Spain and Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood got cold feet when it was revealed that Nesler was on 
methamphetamine at the time of the shooting. Even some of her local support 
began to wane as Nesler seemed to bask too much in the publicity of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 During her trial, Serra argued that Nesler would have never shot Driver had 
she not been pushed over the edge by a series of fast-moving events that 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 First, her son could not stop vomiting in anticipation of testifying against 
Driver, who once allegedly threatened to kill the boy and his mother if he told 
anyone about the molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then as Driver was led into the courtroom by sheriff's deputies, he reportedly 
smirked at Nesler and the boy. Nesler lunged at Driver and had to be held back 
by family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, another mother who had testified earlier against Driver told Nesler 
in the hall outside the courtroom that her testimony and the testimony of her 
child was weak and that Driver "was going to walk." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Nesler, according to Serra, filched a palm-size small-caliber 
semiautomatic from her sister's purse, which was hanging unattended in the 
court hall, went back into the courtroom and emptied the pistol, missing only 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors argued that Nesler was making good on a promise of vengeance she 
had uttered many times over the three years it took for the case to get to 
court. "She meant to, expected to, intended to kill Daniel Driver," prosecutor 
Jo Graves argued. "We're talking about the murder of a man in custody in 
handcuffs." 
</P>
<P>
 The probation report said Nesler showed no remorse for the killing and would 
probably do it again. A Stanford doctor has said that Nesler has a 50% chance 
of surviving five years with chemotherapy. But the cancer is so far advanced 
that a mastectomy would not be effective.

THOUSANDS IN MEXICO MARCH TO BACK INDIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON and JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of workers, peasants and students marched through the Mexican 
capital Friday demanding an end to the military force used to fight Indian 
guerrillas who are threatening to spread their rebellion beyond the remote 
hills of southern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, already badly shaken by 
the uprising that has claimed more than 100 lives, now faces mounting political 
protest over the decision to launch a vigorous ground and air assault against 
the rebels. Human rights and church officials fear civilian casualties, and 
there have been reports of apparent extrajudicial executions of suspected 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatista National Liberation Army, as the rebels call themselves, claimed 
responsibility for toppling two electrical towers late Thursday night in the 
states of Michoacan and Puebla, south of Mexico City. Officials confirmed the 
damage Friday but said power was not interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 As new details emerged about their origins, the Zapatista rebels vowed to wage 
their self-proclaimed "war" against the Mexican government in the capital and, 
in communiques faxed to newspaper and wire service offices, invited followers 
to join in acts of sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for the rebels spread to Los Angeles, where hundreds of demonstrators 
gathered noisily but peacefully Friday night in front of the Mexican Consulate 
in the Wilshire District to condemn the Mexican government's tactics in putting 
down the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hills surrounding San Cristobal de las Casas in the southern Chiapas 
state where the violence began New Year's Day, government troops in helicopter 
gunships and armored personnel carriers continued hunting rebels who have 
largely retreated from the towns they first occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of soldiers conducted house-to-house searches in San Cristobal, 
while sporadic air attacks continued to be reported near the towns of Tenejapa 
and Cancuuc, the seats of the two poorest townships in impoverished Chiapas.  
</P>
<P>
 The most deadly armed rebellion in Mexico in decades has cast a rare -- and 
perhaps unwanted -- spotlight on this country's military, traditionally the 
silent partner in Mexican government. With an estimated 12,000 troops deployed 
to fight the rebels, the army has been thrust into the unfamiliar role of 
guerrilla warfare. And with that comes unfamiliar scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army has been a taboo subject here. Now there are public questions about 
the role it is playing, what human rights violations have been committed, who 
is the army accountable to," said Mexican political scientist Denise Dresser. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this will lead to greater questions about the Mexican government itself." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Central America, where armies traditionally exert control over 
civilian authorities, Mexico's military and civilian powers operate under an 
agreement whereby the army submits to civilian order but the government does 
not interfere with military internal affairs. The army is rarely criticized in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military does not want to be the fall guy for the failure of civilian 
political decisions that were made or not made," said Roderic Camp, a political 
scientist at Tulane University who has written on the Mexican military. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therefore the civilian leadership has to move very gingerly in terms of what 
it asks the military to do and what restrictions it places on the military to 
carry out those functions." 
</P>
<P>
 The army killed dozens, perhaps hundreds, of students in a demonstration in 
1968, but not since a movement led by Lucio Cabanas in the southern Sierra 
Madre range in the early 1970s has the Mexican army had to fight guerrilla 
warfare. For nearly eight years, Cabanas rallied rebels in Guerrero state 
before he was slain by the army. 
</P>
<P>
 For image-conscious Salinas, who has used most of his five years in office to 
portray Mexico as modernizing democracy and reliable trade partner, the 
surfacing allegations of human rights abuse pose yet another public relations 
headache. 
</P>
<P>
 The president took great pains in a nationally televised speech Thursday night 
to praise the army in the face of those reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army and the state security forces are fulfilling their responsibility 
according to the law," he said, denying that troops would attack civilian 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 But his comments did little to assuage the mostly leftist demonstrators who 
marched Friday down Mexico City's La Reforma boulevard, chanting for an end to 
the "massacre" in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the protesters, estimated at about 6,000, said they did not support 
the rebels' use of violence but said they agreed fully with the demands of 
land, political freedom and social justice that the rebels say they are 
fighting for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are showing solidarity with the political protest," said Jose L. Ortiz, a 
56-year-old Nahuas Indian who walked near the head of the march. "If the people 
in Chiapas reached this extreme (of violence), then it is because of the 
political errors of this government and past governments. These people have 
been ignored for centuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of the protesters carried banners supporting the Zapatista rebels, 
including one that bore a portrait of Emiliano Zapata, the revolutionary war 
hero whose name the rebels have borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles march, 400 demonstrators marched along the sidewalk outside 
the consulate, chanting "Viva La Revolucion" and waving signs proclaiming "Stop 
the Massacre of the Maya." Costumed performers danced to the beat of a drum. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no response from the consulate, which was closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, the government's attorney general's office said autopsies had 
been completed on 30 bodies recovered at Ocosingo, scene of the heaviest 
fighting. Reporters had discovered bodies at Ocosingo with signs of having had 
their hands tied behind their backs and with single shots to the head. But the 
government's examiners concluded that only one of the dead might have been the 
victim of an illegal execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials Friday did not address the signs that the rebels may have a larger 
network than first thought, as the destruction of the electrical towers could 
suggest. In addition, the literature distributed by the organization is 
sophisticated, apparently using offset printing, photos and colors. 
</P>
<P>
 All along, however, Salinas and his aides have insisted that rather than an 
indigenous movement, the Zapatista army is controlled by non-Indian 
"professionals" who have received help from Guatemalan or Salvadoran leftists. 
</P>
<P>
 However, researchers who live in San Cristobal said that after talking to the 
rebels when they invaded, they believe most of them are from eastern parts of 
the state that were jungle a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they were tired of not being listened to, tired of repression," 
said Ron Nye, an anthropologist who has worked in southern Mexico for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels are mainly the descendants of Tzeltal Indians who were resettled to 
the Lacandon Rain Forest 25 years ago, he said. Their parents were landless 
peasants who rented farms or worked for cattle ranchers in the area around 
Ocosingo, about 50 miles northeast of San Cristobal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has seen the Lacandon as an escape valve," said Nye, who is 
also an organic agronomist. "They were given land, but they were not given 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 With no other alternative, they turned to the slash-and-burn farming that they 
had used in the highlands, said Will Hoffman, cultural projects coordinator at 
Casa Na Bolom, a research center in San Cristobal. In the delicate jungle, the 
effect was devastating. The thin layer of jungle topsoil was soon destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the situation has worsened as the price of coffee, one crop 
they could grow, has plummeted and the government has removed farm price 
supports as part of its free market economic reforms, Nye said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nye bristled at government statements that the peasants were fooled into the 
uprising by foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is racist to say that the Indians were tricked," he said. "They are much 
more aware of the risks than the government is giving them credit for, at least 
publicly." 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials said they have arrested 106 suspected rebels.

VIACOM, BLOCKBUSTER UNVEIL SURPRISE MERGER; BUSINESS: TWO COMPANIES MAKE AN 
EXTRAORDINARY MOVE IN LAST-MINUTE BID TO TAKE OVER PARAMOUNT INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a cliffhanger worthy of a Hollywood box office hit, Viacom Inc. and 
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. agreed to merge Friday as part of an 
eleventh-hour gambit to derail a marriage between QVC Network and Paramount 
Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the proposed merger -- the result of marathon negotiations over the 
last three days -- Viacom-Blockbuster said it will sweeten its bid to $105 a 
share, or a total of $6.5 billion, for 50.1% of Paramount's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was the most dramatic yet in the 4-month-old takeover brawl for the 
entertainment giant that includes Paramount Pictures and Simon & Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also one of the most extraordinary actions in U.S. corporate history. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts on Friday were scratching their heads over the ramifications, since 
there appears to be no precedent for two companies as large as Viacom and 
Blockbuster merging in order to facilitate a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom and Blockbuster valued their stock-swap merger at $8.4 billion, based 
on Friday's closing stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 If the companies succeed in acquiring Paramount, the resulting three-way 
merger would produce a company with a staggering market value of $25 billion 
and revenue of about $10 billion. The new company would generate about $1.4 
billion a year in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the merger agreement created a furor on Wall Street over whether 
Viacom-Blockbuster had put forth a substantially new bid that would reset the 
clock another 10 days in the Paramount bidding, or whether shareholders should 
begin tendering the stock immediately to QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, QVC on Friday charged that Viacom's new offer violates the bidding 
procedures previously agreed to by all the parties in the Paramount fight. 
</P>
<P>
 On those grounds, QVC's lawyers contended that Viacom's new offer does not 
"trigger a new round of bidding." 
</P>
<P>
 QVC's advisers are expected to make a decision about extending that company's 
tender offer before the weekend is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street traders on Friday were already speculating that BellSouth Corp., 
one of QVC's backers, might help QVC raise its bid by upping its investment in 
the home shopping channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Viacom and Blockbuster's merger announcement was draped in the 
virtues of combining one of the largest cable-TV companies with the premier 
home video retailer in the country, analysts said it was really driven by 
Viacom's need to align itself with a partner that has the financial wherewithal 
to prevail in the Paramount takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Viacom on its own was offering $85 per share, and QVC was offering 
$92 per share, for 51% of Paramount's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies were also offering a package of securities for the remaining 
49%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts immediately responded by noting that the "blended value" of the 
revised Viacom-Blockbuster offer -- the combined value of cash and stock -- was 
less than QVC's tender offer now on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lower bid," Furman Selz analyst John Tinker said. "But it's a greater 
proportion of cash. So QVC will probably have to increase its cash portion a 
little bit. The real issue is Viacom and Blockbuster now have another 10 days 
to figure how far they really want to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Reiff, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., said that "there is no 
question that Viacom has a higher cash bid. But it's only 50% of the company. 
So the real value is in the back end, and we'll know about that next week when 
trading begins again." 
</P>
<P>
 Trading in Viacom and Blockbuster stocks was halted before the announcement 
was made Friday afternoon, making it difficult for analysts to calculate the 
value of the new bid based on market reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the merger agreement, Blockbuster shareholders will receive 0.08 of a 
share of Viacom class A stock, 0.60615 of a share of Viacom class B stock and 
one "variable common right" for each share of Blockbuster that is convertible 
to class B shares. 
</P>
<P>
 If Viacom-Blockbuster is successful in acquiring Paramount -- the merger is 
not contingent on the tender offer -- Blockbuster has agreed to invest an 
additional $1.5 billion in Viacom through the purchase of Viacom class B 
shares. The companies said that will provide Paramount shareholders a richer 
cash reward without diluting their stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone, who previously said the bidding for Paramount 
had reached "Never Never Land," defended the new higher bid on the grounds that 
the extra cash was coming from Blockbuster and not Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Viacom has not had to add one more cent from our last offer in order to 
increase the cash component," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone would still control about 60% of a merged Viacom and Blockbuster and 
hold about 30% of the equity. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the proposed merger builds upon the companies' shared vision of 
becoming a broad-based entertainment giant for the anticipated technological 
revolution in interactive television and video-on-demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster Chief Executive H. Wayne Huizenga would apparently take a 
secondary role. 
</P>
<P>
 Unclear is what role, if any, Paramount Chief Executive Martin S. Davis would 
play in a combined Viacom-Blockbuster-Paramount entity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Davis had been tagged to become chief executive in the event of a 
Viacom-Paramount merger, there was no mention of him in the Viacom-Blockbuster 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis "understands the situation a lot, and whether there is a role for him to 
play is something we will give a lot of thought to," Redstone said. "But no 
matter what they outcome (Viacom Chief Executive Frank Biondi) will be C.E.O." 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of a full-scale merger first came up in late December, according 
to sources, with talks led by Huizenga and Blockbuster Vice Chairman Steven 
Berrard on Blockbuster's side and Redstone and Biondi in Viacom's side. 
</P>
<P>
 Berrard and Biondi talked briefly about the deal over the holidays in Arizona, 
where both happened to be vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations reached a frenzy this week, continuing nonstop from Wednesday 
until the deal was signed Friday afternoon, about 2:30 EST. Most participants 
got little or no sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult issues eventually came down to control and price, as they 
do with most mergers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, however, Berrard declined to single out any specific hurdle, 
saying much of the time was spent on "mechanical and procedural" issues over 
what type of Viacom shares Blockbuster stockholders would receive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Huizenga is taking a back seat to Redstone, a place the 
entrepreneur has virtually no familiarity with. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, no specific succession plan has been put in place spelling out 
what Huizenga's role would be upon Redstone's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some executives who know Huizenga well said they were surprised that he would 
do that, and suggested that it might not be so easy for Huizenga and Redstone 
to work side by side because of their strong personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berrard said the two get along very well, and he discounted any potential 
friction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chemistry between the two of them is what made this happen," Berrard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Redstone will have more than 60% of the voting control of the combined 
company, Blockbuster shareholders will own about 60% of the equity, Berrard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One question is whether there would a conflict in the ownership of 
professional hockey teams, because Huizenga owns the Florida Panthers and 
Paramount own the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 National Hockey League rules prohibit owners from having more than one team. 
</P>
<P>
 Berrard downplayed any conflict, saying that the Panthers are a personal 
investment of Huizenga's that would be separate from Paramount's ownership of 
the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in Hollywood have speculated that the Viacom deal amounts to an 
acknowledgment by Blockbuster that its video-rental business -- however 
profitable it is now -- has a limited life with technological advances on the 
horizon that will allow movie watchers to call up vast numbers of films from 
home.  
</P>
<P>
 Berrard, however, said the fear of becoming obsolete was not a motivating 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology, as far as we are concerned, is a long way out. This merger had 
nothing to do with a fear of technology. If anything, we're excited to think we 
can build our business and also be involved in technology," Berrard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berrard said that the companies, even without Paramount, see a number of 
business opportunities together. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Berrard said, Blockbuster now controls Discovery Zone, an 
indoor play center for children that could benefit by linking up with Viacom's 
Nickelodeon children's channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster's more than 3,000 stores would also help Viacom market products 
related to its MTV and Nickelodeon channels, he said.

 Researched by ADAM S. BAUMAN / Los Angeles Times Next Moves in Bidding War 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed merger between Viacom and Blockbuster gives Viacom the financial 
firepower to up its ante for Paramount. But the deals are far from concluded. 
Here's a look at what may lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidding: QVC has until Jan. 21 (10 working days) to make a new offer. 
</P>
<P>
 And more bidding: Under Paramount's bidding rules, Viacom and Blockbuster 
would have another 10 days to top a higher QVC offer. 
</P>
<P>
 And more meetings: Paramount directors will meet next week to consider the 
latest Viacom/Blockbuster offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Decision time: Paramount shareholders decide individually which suitor to 
tender shares to. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile: Blockbuster and Viacom shareholders vote on the merger of the two 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Approvals: Regulatory clearances, such as from the Federal Communications 
commission, are sought.

AFFLUENT CITIES HELP THEIR NEIGHBOR TURN BACK CRIME; POLICE: OFFICERS FROM 
NEARBY DEPARTMENTS AND THE CHP MAKE EAST PALO ALTO A LAW ENFORCEMENT MODEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not long ago, drug dealers armed with automatic weapons controlled the streets 
of this small, poverty-stricken community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department -- understaffed and ineffective -- was paralyzed by 
investigations into brutality and corruption. By 1992, violence was so rampant 
that East Palo Alto was branded the murder capital of the nation, with 42 
killings in a city of fewer than 24,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In adjoining cities such as Palo Alto and Menlo Park, affluent residents found 
spent bullets in their yards and talked of building traffic barriers at key 
intersections to hold back what they saw as a tide of ghetto crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a remarkable transformation, East Palo Alto has become a model of 
intensive policing and regional cooperation that some leaders hope can be 
adopted in high-crime neighborhoods elsewhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 A continuing police crackdown using officers donated by Palo Alto, Menlo Park, 
San Mateo County and the California Highway Patrol has cut the homicide rate in 
East Palo Alto by 86%. Two years ago, there were eight slayings on one block 
alone; in 1993, there were six killings in the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
 In his State of the State Address this week, Gov. Pete Wilson praised the 
joint effort and proposed training 500 new CHP officers who could be sent in 
the same fashion to other communities racked by violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swift response and a united community worked in East Palo Alto, and it can 
work around our state to reduce the fears felt by too many Californians," the 
governor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the East Palo Alto campaign were pleased by the governor's 
recognition of their efforts but uncertain how well their program would 
translate to larger communities, such as Los Angeles. The long-term answer, 
they stressed, is not just locking up criminals but attracting businesses, jobs 
and training. 
</P>
<P>
 During the police crackdown, East Palo Alto has tried to create a new civic 
atmosphere and embarked on an economic development program. With the help of 
Palo Alto and Menlo Park, the city has sponsored a summer program for children, 
put in new park playground equipment, fixed potholes, cleaned up vacant lots 
and towed away 1,600 junked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always said the solution is not just police," said East Palo Alto 
Mayor Sharifa Wilson. "The overall concern is to get to the root of the 
problem. We have to figure out a way to bring money into the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Others note that most crime-ridden communities do not have prosperous 
neighbors like Palo Alto and Menlo Park willing to donate police officers, 
resources, equipment and staff time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an analogy here of what could be done in South-Central (Los 
Angeles)," said Menlo Park City Councilwoman Gail Slocum, a former Los Angeles 
attorney who played a pivotal role in the effort to aid East Palo Alto. "The 
problem is, they don't have Palo Alto next door. Would people from Pasadena 
really help? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Wedged between San Francisco Bay and the wealthy Palo Alto and Menlo Park, the 
2 1/2-square-mile community of East Palo Alto has long been the outcast of the 
San Francisco Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Before World War II, it was known as Runnymede and was the center of a utopian 
experiment in chicken farming. After the war, with widespread redlining by 
lenders and real estate agents, blacks settled in the low-income community. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely over a mile from Stanford University, the city's main commercial strip 
became known as Whiskey Gulch and was a popular spot among Stanford students 
because it was the closest place to buy liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of neglect by San Mateo County government, the community voted to 
incorporate as a city in 1983, but rejected a ballot measure to change its name 
to Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
 With no supermarket or bank and few jobs available, the drug trade has 
flourished in recent years. Like the Stanford students who once came for 
alcohol, narcotics users drive to East Palo Alto from surrounding cities to buy 
drugs from young men sell their wares on the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Police trace much of the recent surge in violence to drug deals. In 1992, they 
note, 16 of the 42 people slain in East Palo Alto were outsiders who had 
apparently come in search of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also has been beset by gang violence as the town has grown more 
racially diverse, setting off rivalries between different racial groups and 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 When the number of homicides soared to 42 in 1992 -- twice as many as in each 
of the previous four years -- leaders of neighboring communities were shocked 
into action. Elected officials in Menlo Park and Palo Alto recognized that 
crime transcended city lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bullets don't know any boundaries," said Slocum, who used to hear gunfire 
routinely at her home in Menlo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 By chance last year, the mayors of all three cities were women -- Wilson, 
Slocum and Palo Alto Mayor Jean McCown. Unlike their male predecessors, they 
were able to break down much of the hostility between the cities that had grown 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 An important part of their cooperative plan was that East Palo Alto officials 
make the decisions, whether it was in running the multi-agency police force or 
in implementing an economic development plan. With that understanding, the two 
wealthier cities assigned staff members to help East Palo Alto, solicited 
private donations and, in the case of Menlo Park, donated an old street 
sweeper. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first step, they agreed, was to beef up the police force, which at 35 
officers was so understaffed it could not put more than three officers on the 
street at a time. Officers spent most of their shifts running from crime to 
crime, ignoring all but the most violent incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have enough to suit up a team," said Capt. John Sterling. "It was 
like we were playing six-man football against the Forty-Niners." 
</P>
<P>
 Palo Alto donated four officers; Menlo Park provided two. Later, the San Mateo 
County Sheriff's Department brought in 18 deputies and the state assigned 12 
Highway Patrol officers. In all, the outside officers more than doubled the 
strength of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highway Patrol took over traffic enforcement in the city, freeing other 
officers to tackle more serious crimes. For the first time, motorists in East 
Palo Alto started getting pulled over in routine traffic stops. And during the 
last nine months of 1993, the CHP made 724 drunken driving arrests -- more than 
all the driving-under-the-influence arrests in the city's history, Sterling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the direction of newly appointed East Palo Alto Police Chief Burnham 
Matthews, the multi-agency force has tried to pick its targets, forming special 
teams for rapid response and conducting surveillance of suspected drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of federal agents, it conducted a drug sting that resulted in 85 
arrests in two days. Another 95 people were arrested in a sweep of suspects 
with outstanding warrants. And a handful of criminals were put away on federal 
weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews and Sterling, who worked together in Oakland as police lieutenants, 
also have tried to instill a more professional attitude in the East Palo Alto 
Police Department. On New Year's Eve, for example, officers usually hid in 
their cars under freeway overpasses while residents went on a shooting spree. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two New Year's celebrations, however, every available officer has 
been assigned to duty, ordered to keep a high profile and to respond quickly to 
any sounds of gunfire. This New Year's was the quietest in years, Sterling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a lesson in the East Palo Alto experience for other cities, 
Sterling said, it is to focus on small neighborhoods, balancing a heavy police 
presence with economic development and community improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law enforcement alone is not the answer," he said. "It's the immediate first 
step."

 "We came here for a better quality of life, not for ideology, and when that 
quality goes so will we," said Tzvika Levy, 33, a civil servant who lives with 
his wife and their three children in Karnei Shomrom, a Jewish settlement of 
4,970 about 20 miles northeast of Tel Aviv in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are thousands of families living across the 'green line' (the old 
demarcation between Israel and Jordan) for ideological reasons, but there is a 
not insignificant nucleus who moved to the occupied territories simply for the 
quality of life," Levy added. "Most would rather leave now than wait five 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion surveys conducted among settlers show 30% of the 30,000 families are 
willing to leave for adequate compensation. Levy said his informal canvass of 
residents in his own and nearby settlements suggests the proportion may 
actually be half. Political scientist Ehud Sprinczak at Hebrew University has 
put the ultimate total at perhaps 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Nachman, mayor of Ariel, one of the largest West Bank settlements with a 
population of 12,900, acknowledged that the number of families planning to move 
is increasing because of the uncertainty over the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's completely natural," said Nachman, who is also a Parliament member from 
the opposition Likud Party. "People feel that the government has left them 
without any security, has abandoned them and is endangering their very lives. 
It's natural some people think that before the ship sinks they should jump 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring it "inconceivable that Jews would live under an Arab government," 
Nachman advocates a series of Israeli and Palestinian sectors in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, so that each group could live in autonomy and the Jewish 
settlements could be linked together amid the 2 million Palestinian residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such a resolution, Nachman predicted all 144 Jewish settlements -- 
even those founded in a religious and Zionist reclaiming of the biblical Land 
of Israel -- will go. 
</P>
<P>
 But leaders of the settler movement, determined not to yield territory they 
view as Israeli, consider such talk defeatist. They are pushing plans to double 
the number of settlements and recruit more families for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movement to the territories is much greater than the movement out despite 
the 18-month-old freeze on new housing and construction," said Moshe Feiglin, 
head of This Is Our Land, a new group based in Karnei Shomrom, where Levy 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many settlers are discussing the amount of compensation they would need to 
resettle within Israel -- perhaps $50,000 a person. The government is beginning 
to make its own confidential estimates, which reportedly run from $5 billion to 
$10 billion, of what it might cost to move the settlers and rehouse them. 
</P>
<P>
 Yossi Katz, a Parliament member from the ruling Labor Party, has drafted 
legislation calling for compensation for any Jewish resident of the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip who wants to leave. He says he gets scores of telephone calls 
and letters each day inquiring when the plan will take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to leave the territories now and not wait five years until there 
is a final resolution of their future," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knesset, Israel's Parliament, rejected a Likud bill this week on 
compensation based on similar legislation for Israeli settlers evacuated from 
the Sinai Peninsula when it was returned to Egypt in 1982. It acted at 
government insistence the bill was premature and would upset negotiations with 
the Palestine Liberation Organization.

LATIN AMERICA; CHILE'S POLITICAL PRISONERS PUT AYLWIN ON SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free the freedom-fighters, the left demands. Don't turn the terrorists loose, 
the right protests. 
</P>
<P>
 President Patricio Aylwin is caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearing the end of his four-year term, Aylwin faces some of his hardest 
decisions yet on the tough issue of what to do with "subversives" convicted for 
violent crimes under the former dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
 When Aylwin took office in March, 1990, almost 400 Chileans were in jail for 
politically motivated offenses under the Pinochet regime. Presidential pardons 
and commuted sentences have helped whittle that number down to 11. But some of 
the last cases are the most controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 In his latest act of leniency, just before Christmas, Aylwin freed a Communist 
guerrilla who had been sentenced to 35 years in prison by a military court for 
a 1986 robbery-ambush in which a member of Chile's Carabineros police force was 
killed. Aylwin, acting with his legal authority, commuted the sentence to exile 
in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 "As if Carabineros did not have a right to life and to justice," protested the 
policeman's mother. Such protests have reverberated loudly in the Chilean news 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most criticized aspects of the current government's performance 
has been its policy on pardons," said an editorial Wednesday in the 
conservative daily newspaper El Mercurio. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Aylwin has commuted the sentences of 18 leftists convicted of violent 
political crimes, exiling them to Europe. More than 150 other political 
prisoners have received pardons and are free in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most controversial pending requests for pardons are those of three 
men serving life sentences for an attempt to assassinate Pinochet in 1986. He 
escaped, but five of his bodyguards were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-Pinochet Sen. Eugenio Cantuarias has warned that pardons for those 
prisoners would "necessarily affect" the "climate of trust that should exist 
between the armed forces and civilians." Although Pinochet gave up government 
power in 1990, he remains commander of the army. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who favor release of all political prisoners argue that most of them 
already have served long terms and that many did not receive fair trials in 
military courts. They say the pardons contribute to peace and reconciliation in 
a country that was violently divided. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftists claim that violence used to resist the dictatorship was legitimate. 
Former rebel Belinda Zubicueta, pardoned in October, declared that she had been 
"unjustly jailed all these years for exercising my legitimate right to 
rebellion against a dictatorship that imposed state terrorism in our country." 
</P>
<P>
 Chile's private Commission for the Defense of the People, which provides legal 
aid to political prisoners, does not condone acts of terrorism but pushes for 
pardons on the grounds that the 16-year military regime was a period of serious 
human rights violations, arbitrary rule and abnormal judicial processes.  
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult for Aylwin to ignore that kind of reasoning when it comes from 
political allies such as the Socialist Party, which was brutally persecuted 
early in the military regime and now shares power with the president's 
Christian Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics argue that crimes in which blood was shed should not be "rewarded" 
with leniency.  
</P>
<P>
 Aylwin's justice minister said last week that the president will not leave any 
of the pending requests for pardons unresolved when he hands over power in 
March to his elected successor, Eduardo Frei. Even if Frei is spared having to 
deal with those requests, however, others are expected to arise. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of the former regime's political prisoners who now are free on 
recognizance still have charges pending against them, as do many rebels who 
fled military rule and now plan to return. If they are convicted, Frei will 
face the issue of whether to pardon them. Leaders' Lingering Problem 
</P>
<P>
 The question of what to do with political prisoners is a prickly matter that 
spans three changes of the nation's leadership. Gen. Augusto Pinochet 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 400 Chileans were in jail for "subversion" when former dictator stepped 
down in 1990. Three had tried to assassinate him. President Patricio Aylwin 
</P>
<P>
 Aylwin has pardoned most political prisoners or commuted their sentences. But 
11 controversial cases remain unresolved. Eduardo Frei 
</P>
<P>
 President-elect takes office in March. Aylwin has vowed to resolve all 
requests for pardons by then. But others may arise.

WHITE HOUSE REPORTEDLY PLANS PUBLIC HOUSING FUNDS CUT; BUDGET: ABOUT $2 BILLION 
WOULD BE DIVERTED TO OTHER PROGRAMS WITH HIGHER PRIORITIES IN THE CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration is planning to cut more than $2 billion from 
several longstanding federal public housing programs in an effort to free more 
funds for higher priority initiatives endorsed by the White House, sources here 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the tight fiscal constraints it is facing, the White House has been 
forced to reduce funding for an array of programs in the 1995 budget that it 
will present to Congress next month. But one Administration source acknowledged 
that slashing outlays for public housing could have a devastating impact 
because it would "hurt the most needy" Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money likely would be redirected toward other programs that 
provide rental assistance for the poor and housing for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 As negotiations continue over the shape of the 1995 budget, sources in 
Congress and the Administration said that Clinton is likely to cut funding to 
$2.6 billion from $4.6 billion for the primary federal programs that create 
public housing units and renovate old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious and significant setback for the programs and for the 
people who use the progued that the planned cuts are inconsistent with the 
President's oft-stated goals of helping people get off welfare, creating jobs 
and improving the lives and opportunities of poor Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inconsistent for the Administration to say it's going to get people off 
welfare, improve education for low-income Americans and improve health care for 
poor Americans when they're not providing stable housing situations for people 
to live in," said Cushing Dolbeare, president of the National Low-Income 
Housing Coalition. "Without more housing available, it is inconceivable to me 
that that President can achieve his other promises." 
</P>
<P>
 Without stable housing, people on welfare will not be able to concentrate on 
getting the training they need to get jobs, she said. Thousands of construction 
jobs for creating and renovating public housing will be lost. The lack of 
stable housing makes obtaining good health care for yourself and your family 
almost impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Cavanaugh, general counsel for the Council of Large Public Housing 
Authorities, warned that as a result of the cuts, people who depend on public 
housing will have even more deplorable living conditions and more public 
housing units will become too dilapidated to be occupied. Currently, 100,000 of 
the 1.4 million public housing units are empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many public housing tenants will suffer poor living conditions longer and the 
lamentable vacant units in public housing will remain vacant," Cavanaugh, who 
is a lobbies Congress for the council, said. "It has to be seen as an awful 
blow to Secretary Cisneros' strong efforts to make conditions better for people 
in public housing." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavanaugh said his sources in Congress confirm the same cuts to public housing 
programs as specified by the Administration official.

 The Clinton Administration is planning to cut more than $2 billion from 
several longstanding federal public housing programs in an effort to free more 
funds for higher-priority initiatives endorsed by the White House, sources here 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the tight fiscal constraints it is facing, the White House has been 
forced to reduce funding for an array of programs in the 1995 budget that it 
will present to Congress next month. But one Administration source acknowledged 
that slashing outlays for public housing could have a devastating impact 
because it would "hurt the most needy" Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money likely would be redirected toward other programs that 
provide rental assistance for the poor and housing for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 As negotiations continue over the shape of the 1995 budget, sources in 
Congress and the Administration said Clinton is likely to cut funding to $2.6 
billion from $4.6 billion for the primary federal programs that create new 
public housing units and renovate old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious and significant setback for the programs and for the 
people who use the programs," the Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The official, who asked not to be named, conceded he was disclosing the 
information before the proposal becomes final in hopes that pressure from the 
public will persuade the Administration and Congress to leave the funding 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for some of the proposed cuts, the Administration is expected to 
request increases for programs that create housing for homeless people to $1.2 
billion from $823 million, sources said. And it wants to almost double money 
spent on vouchers used by low-income people to rent privately owned housing 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 But the official warned that, by decreasing the number of public housing units 
available, the Administration could end up confounding its efforts to decrease 
the number of homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that one of the main problems leading to homelessness is 
the lack of affordable housing," the official said. "These cuts would decrease 
the number of affordable housing units available, thereby creating more 
homeless. It makes a bad situation worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals would be part of the President's $1.5-trillion budget for fiscal 
1995, which begins next Oct. 1. Although Clinton is not expected to unveil the 
budget until Feb. 7, details involving specific programs targeted for cuts or 
increases are already emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Management and Budget had planned to eliminate funding for one 
public housing program, and signficantly reduce another. But the proposal 
created "high anxiety" within the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD Secretary Henry G. Cisneros appealed to the White House and was able to 
win assurances that the cuts would not be as large as originally planned.

NATO CHIEF UPBEAT ON MEMBERSHIP PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner declared Friday that he believes Russia 
and other Eastern European nations will accept a plan that would eventually 
admit the former Communist states as members. 
</P>
<P>
 Such acceptance would guarantee a success for next week's summit meeting of 
the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- and for President Clinton's 
first European appearance as leader of the Western alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO summit meeting in Brussels next Monday and Tuesday will result in 
approval of the controversial "Partnership for Peace" program, Woerner said, 
which offers to East European nations, including Russia, closer military ties 
with the West and the prospect of eventual NATO membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Clinton will travel to Eastern Europe after the summit to reassure 
various leaders, including those in Moscow and Ukraine, Woerner predicted that 
the summit results will satisfy most of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Other European officials have suggested that Clinton must demonstrate 
leadership qualities at Brussels and sell the new plan to East European leaders 
if NATO is to have a serious future as an alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 In Warsaw on Friday, American envoys and Polish leaders met to try to win 
support for the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 As an incentive for Poland to accept limited NATO membership, one of the U.S. 
delegates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. John Shalikashvili, said the 
alliance is willing to hold joint exercises with Polish forces in Poland, the 
New York Times and The Washington Post reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Partnership for Peace is the centerpiece of the NATO summit -- considered by 
many the most important in its 45-year history because of the complexity of 
creating a new role for the organization by offering East Europeans a security 
blanket without offending Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Europeans insist that they need NATO's security guarantees to pursue 
democratic, free-market policies unhindered by Russian threats. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russia objects to an extension of NATO's protective borders alongside the 
former Soviet Union, creating what Moscow says is a new line dividing East and 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 Woerner, a former German defense minister, said he believes that opening the 
door to future NATO membership for East European nations -- including Russia 
and former Soviet countries such as Ukraine -- could resolve the current 
alliance argument as to NATO's new role in the wake of its success during 40 
years of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 But he admitted that some East European leaders "might not be fully satisfied" 
-- or might even be disappointed by -- the NATO offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Partnership for Peace plan does not set a definite timetable or specific 
set of guidelines for full NATO membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Woerner, in a telephone interview with American correspondents in London, Bonn 
and Washington simultaneously, was asked whether Bosnia-Herzegovina would 
belatedly be included on the summit agenda. He said the French had asked to 
discuss the problems of the U.N. peacekeeping and humanitarian force there. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, he said U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali held a private 
conference with the U.N. commander in the former Yugoslavia, French General 
Jean Cot, who complained that the military force is ill equipped to act 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Woerner said he favored a stronger Western reaction to the bloody events in 
former Yugoslavia but that NATO had not been called upon by the United Nations 
to provide one. Nevertheless, the secretary general said NATO is still prepared 
to launch air strikes against warring factions in Bosnia -- if requested to do 
so by the U.N. Security Council.

ISRAEL FREES 101 PALESTINIANS IN GOODWILL MOVE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel released 101 Palestinian prisoners Friday as a goodwill gesture ahead 
of the resumption of talks with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 A government official said the delay in implementing Palestinian self-rule in 
the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho was eroding support 
for the peace accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had approved a campaign to 
bolster public support at home for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds at the Nahal Oz checkpoint sang nationalist songs as the freed 
prisoners -- all due to be released at the end of the month in any event -- 
entered Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the peace deal was signed in September, the PLO has demanded Israel 
release all of the 12,000 Palestinian prisoners it holds. Israel has already 
released about 600 prisoners.

ALBRIGHT CONDEMNS 'MURDEROUS' SHELLING OF SARAJEVO; BALKANS: U.S. ENVOY TO U.N. 
WARNS SERBIA OF CONTINUED SANCTIONS AND ISSUES A CAUTION TO CROATIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, on Friday 
condemned the "murderous bombardment" of Sarajevo by Bosnian Serbs and put all 
combatants on notice that blocking aid will be considered a war crime. 
</P>
<P>
 As she wrapped up the highest-level American visit to the former Yugoslavia 
since war broke out in 1991, Albright repeated warnings that stiff U.N. 
sanctions against Serbia will continue as long as Serbian rebels imperil 
Bosnian civilians, and she confirmed that an embargo has also been threatened 
against Croatia if it worsens Bosnia's suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 The message sent by Albright's three-day tour of Croatia was one of staunch 
American support for humanitarian work in the ravaged Balkans and an intention 
to see justice brought to those responsible for atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put all parties on notice that the United States firmly believes that 
preventing or hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid in this conflict 
should be investigated by the prosecutor for war crimes," Albright told 
reporters as she prepared to leave for Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States will not support the easing or the lifting of sanctions by 
the Security Council if, for example, Serbian elements obstruct that work, nor 
will the United States recognize any amnesty for war criminals," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, Albright visited the scene of a mass grave in Serb-occupied 
eastern Croatia, in the village of Ovcara, where at least 200 Croats are 
believed to be buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she discussed sanctions against Croatia in her meeting with Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman, the U.N. envoy said she had. She said she insisted 
that he use his influence with Bosnian Croat nationalists to ensure that they 
comply with cease-fire and safe-passage accords they have signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tudjman "is very much aware of the concern of the United States about actions 
of the HVO," Albright said, referring to the Bosnian Croat army. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council imposed sanctions on the Serb-ruled remains of the 
Yugoslav federation in May, 1992, in punishment of Belgrade's arming and 
instigating of Serb rebels who encircled Sarajevo with artillery and have been 
laying siege to the capital for 21 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Croats turned against their former Muslim allies in the defense 
against the Serbian siege more than a year ago, aided by heavy artillery and 
troops sent by Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 The international community has repeatedly raised the prospect of sanctions 
against Croatia but appears fearful of strengthening the hand of nationalist 
extremists, as has happened in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 While Albright made a point of noting all parties have thwarted life-saving 
relief work, she singled out Serbs for particular criticism more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need evidence that the Bosnian Serbs are using all of their influence to 
guarantee free passage" for relief convoys, she said in an interview with 
Croatian television. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking note of the intensified shelling of Sarajevo this week, in which at 
least 40 civilians have been killed, Albright said she favors tightening 
sanctions on Belgrade as long as the Serbs persist with their aggressive 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. policy in Bosnia has become a major issue ahead of a summit of the 
16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization next week, especially after 
appeals by France for more direct military involvement of U.S. troops in 
Bosnia.

ARRESTS MADE IN S. AFRICA RACIAL ATTACKS; VIOLENCE: NINE WHITES HELD IN MURDERS

 Police announced breakthroughs Friday in two recent racial attacks, arresting 
nine white men accused of murdering and mutilating blacks and arresting a fifth 
black militant allegedly involved in a brutal assault on a mostly white Cape 
Town bar.

 Although more than 13,000 people have been killed in political violence since

paramilitary groups clearly motivated by racial hatred are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 The two attacks last month sent waves of rage and fear across this nervous 
nation, especially since the bloodletting is expected to grow as the country 
braces for its first democratic elections next April. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cape Town, police said they had arrested a fifth member of the Pan 
Africanist Congress, a radical black nationalist group that refuses to renounce 
its armed struggle against the white-ruled government. The group's guerrilla 
wing has claimed responsibility for the bloody Dec. 30 attack on the Heidelburg 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 PAC leaders denied involvement, however, and denounced the five arrests as 
"pure political gangsterism" designed to "rig the elections long before they 
start." 
</P>
<P>
 Opening fire without warning, five black gunmen sprayed the crowded student 
pub with assault rifles, tossed a nail-studded grenade that did not explode and 
left three women and one man dead. Five others were wounded, including a 
university student who may be paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Raymond Dowd, a police spokesman, said investigators had also dug up 
a buried cache of weapons Friday, including four grenades with nails glued to 
them to increase their lethality, a 9-millimeter pistol and ammunition for R-4 
assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 He said forensic and ballistic tests will be conducted to determine whether 
the cache is linked to the Heidelburg pub shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said Wednesday that ballistics tests on 
some of the 90 bullets fired into the bar had already proved a "direct link" 
between the assault rifles used in the massacre and those fired during a 
similar terrorist attack last July at Cape Town's St. James Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven worshipers in the church's multiracial congregation were shot to death 
or killed from exploding nail-studded grenades, and more than 50 people were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent progress into the Heidelburg bar shooting was overshadowed, 
however, after a 14-year-old black youth was shot in the back and killed and 
four others were wounded during a botched police raid on a PAC political 
meeting late Thursday in Cape Town's Guguletu township, a PAC stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 Dowd said police fired rubber bullets and birdshot after a chanting mob of 
angry youths pelted them with stones and tried to free nine young men who had 
been placed in a police vehicle. The nine were released after questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patricia de Lille, a PAC leader, said heavily armed police had fired 
without provocation and set dogs on the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 She insisted that police used live ammunition, not rubber bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate case in Johannesburg, police said they had arrested nine white 
men for allegedly forcing two cars filled with blacks off a rural road west of 
the city early on Dec. 13. Two men and an 11-year-old boy were shot to death, 
and four others were seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the survivors were found inside a vehicle that had been set ablaze. 
Both had been stabbed, and their ears had been cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 The terrified survivors told police that the killers spoke Afrikaans and wore 
camouflage fatigues, except one man dressed in black. Black boots and uniforms 
are worn by the Iron Guard, a neo-Nazi unit that protects Eugene TerreBlanche, 
leader of the white supremacist Afrikaner Resistance Movement. 
</P>
<P>
 TerreBlanche denied involvement.

CUOMO TO SEEK FOURTH TERM AS N.Y. GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, positioning himself as a crime-fighter and 
tax-cutter, announced Friday that he would seek a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by one of the most durable figures in the Democratic Party -- who 
tantalized the nation with his deliberations over whether to seek the 1992 
presidential nomination -- was widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Cuomo told President Clinton that he did not want to be considered 
as a possible Supreme Court justice. But in his careful lawyer's style, he left 
the door open to being a candidate for another seat on the nation's highest 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that Cuomo's popularity is lower now than at any previous time he 
has sought office. But the 61-year-old governor, who possesses formidable 
rhetorical and campaign skills, still runs ahead of potential contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 If reelected, Cuomo would be the longest serving New York governor since 
George Clinton occupied the executive mansion in 1804. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this moment of possibility, I will ask the people for one more opportunity 
to serve them -- an opportunity to complete the job of building the strong, 
peaceful, prosperous future they deserve," Cuomo said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been and continue to be other opportunities for me in life," the 
governor said. "But none are more important or compelling to me than the 
mission I have been charged with as governor. I want to finish the job I have 
begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't need polls to tell me at this moment the people are concerned and 
angry," Cuomo continued. "But I know I can help the state again. I know what 
needs to be done because I've done it before." 
</P>
<P>
 In his state of the state speech Wednesday and again on Friday, Cuomo sketched 
the outline of his campaign. Some Democrats in the Legislature grumbled that by 
stressing tax cuts, tough gun control measures, hiring more state troopers and 
welfare programs featuring work, he sounded more like a Republican than a 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a message designed to undercut many of the issues Republicans plan to 
use against him in the election. The stark speech was deliberately short on 
soaring, graceful language, normally a trademark of the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a time for sweet recitations," Cuomo told the assembled 
lawmakers. "Shakespeare said it best: Action is eloquence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is tragically obvious that the thing that must concern us first and most 
at this moment is the people's safety," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 A November poll by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion showed Cuomo's 
approval rating had fallen to 34.4%, and about 60% of the state's voters did 
not want him to run again. But 57.3% of those polled believed Cuomo had 
generally been a good governor since first taking office in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-ambassador to France Evan G. Galbraith announced Tuesday that he would seek 
the Republican nomination. The field is expected to grow with interest by other 
potential contenders, including former GOP state chairmen Richard M. Rosenbaum 
and J. Patrick Barrett.

ABORTION RIGHTS GROUP EXPANDS FOCUS, STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Abortion Rights Action League, the 25-year-old organization that 
acts as the political arm of the abortion rights movement, announced Friday 
that it is expanding its focus to encompass a wide range of reproductive issues 
and that it will become increasingly active in local politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the shift in emphasis by the renamed National Abortion and 
Reproductive Rights Action League reflects the changing dynamic of the abortion 
debate, now that an Administration that supports abortion rights is in power in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems we face as an organization is that a complacency is 
setting in," said Kate Michelman, president of the organization, which claims a 
quarter-million members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala promised in a 
speech to the group that obtaining universal abortion coverage will remain an 
important element in the Clinton Administration's fight to revamp the nation's 
health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in Congress have warned that the Administration risks losing the entire 
health care battle if it insists on including abortion in the package of health 
benefits guaranteed to every American.

FORUM FOCUSES ON VIOLENCE AMONG BLACKS; CRIME: RAINBOW COALITION'S CONFERENCE 
URGES AFRICAN AMERICANS TO TAKE ACTION ON THE ISSUE. NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS ARE 
PROPOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thin young woman, her voice shaking with emotion, arose Friday near the 
end of a forum on violence in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous speakers had put the blame on many things -- childhood neglect, 
entrenched racism, poor education and leadership failure -- for the explosive 
fratricide in African American neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard it all before," sobbed Tyrene Wilson, a 20-year-old resident of a 
crime-ridden Washington neighborhood. "I'm scared to go out of my door. My 
brother was shot in the head -- I don't know for what. I don't think I'll see 
the year 2000. I need help and I am afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Her poignant plea clearly moved the conference of national leaders of black 
organizations and community activists, who had spent most of the day hearing a 
much more academic discourse on problems of violence in the black community. 
The gathering was convened by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition to 
consider what can be done about violence within the black community in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's organization, joined by the Congressional Black Caucus and other 
groups usually more concerned with legislation than homicide, has focused on 
violence because of its profound impact on African Americans. The meeting here 
was part of a national campaign to induce black people to take action on the 
issue in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 "What once was a crisis, a problem, has turned into a condition," Jackson 
said. "Nearly half of all murder victims are black. More blacks kill each other 
each year than were killed in the entire history of lynchings." 
</P>
<P>
 The causes and proposed solutions offered by participants in Friday's 
conference widely varied. New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy said that his 
city's spending for prosecution and prisons has shot up in recent years from $3 
million to $30 million annually, forcing cuts in social services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know the solutions -- early childhood education works," Barthelemy 
said. "An extra $3 billion a year will get every eligible child in Head Start." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rahin Jenkins, representing a Muslim organization that works with 
prisoners, said the nation is confronted with a generation of angry black men. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's racism -- pure and simple," Jenkins said. "All this crime isn't 
black-on-black crime. Somebody is providing our kids with these weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrist Frances Welsing was cheered by some in the audience when she 
said: "People taking us off the course of talking about racism are doing the 
worst violence of all. . . . We must talk about the cause of the problem or 
otherwise we'll participate in digging our grave." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank McNeil, an alderman from Springfield, Ill., was more pragmatic. Jobs 
must be provided for men coming out of prison if they are to support themselves 
and their families, he said, adding: "McDonald's won't even hire ex-offenders 
right now -- that's the reality." 
</P>
<P>
 And Efia Nwangaza, an attorney from Greenville, S.C., rejected Jackson's 
viewpoint that there are too many guns in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 "To suggest that we should lay down our arms, that we should unilaterally 
disarm, is suicidal," she said. "It's the measure of our insanity that we'll go 
along with the Brady bill (which imposes a five-day waiting period for handgun 
purchases) or any bill that interferes with our right to defend ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who once fought segregation in the South and became a disciple of Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr., said he sees the issue as taking back the moral high 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victims must rise up and demand a change," he said in a luncheon speech. 
"We must change our own ways first. . . . In cities across the country, we want 
to rouse a movement to demilitarize our streets . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson renewed his call for the federal government to spend less on military 
programs and more on social welfare programs for distressed urban areas. But 
the thrust of his message, which has become controversial in the black 
community, was self-improvement. He asked 100 churches in 100 cities to rescue 
10 troubled black youngsters from lives of crime, averting prison and moving to 
self-reliance for 100,000 youth a year. 
</P>
<P>
 One new program in the anti-violence campaign was outlined by Rep. Maxine 
Waters (D-Los Angeles), who said that record companies have contributed $17 
million for a yearlong effort to help 5,000 young black men from some of Los 
Angeles' worst neighborhoods achieve self-reliance through a combination of 
counseling, education and training. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that those from 17 to 30 years old would be targeted by the Black 
Women's Forum of Los Angeles for the "LA 17-30" program to encourage them to 
turn away from crime and dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will include the Crips and the Bloods, the Eight Treys and the Five 
Deuces," she said at a Friday afternoon forum, referring to some of Los 
Angeles' largest gangs. The participants, who will be enrolled in vocational 
education, job training programs or community colleges, will receive $50-a-week 
stipends to pay for transportation and other expenses. Case managers, working 
closely with those enrolled in the program, will be responsible for helping 
them join mainstream society.

ARKANSAN SAYS HE ORDERED HALT TO CLINTON LOANS; INQUIRY: EX-BANKING 
COMMISSIONER WAS TROUBLED BY LENDING BY MCDOUGAL'S INSTITUTION TO THE STATE'S 
BUSINESS AND POLITICAL LEADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former state banking commissioner says that in 1983 he ordered a small 
Arkansas bank run by James B. McDougal to stop making loans to then-Gov. Bill 
Clinton on the grounds that the loans were part of a troubling pattern of 
lending to high-powered members of Arkansas' business and political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin Jackson, the state banking commissioner and a Clinton appointee, said 
the loans to prominent out-of-towners could threaten the stability of the tiny 
bank in Kingston that had confined itself largely to its own community until 
taken over by McDougal, Clinton's partner in the now-controversial Whitewater 
real estate development project. 
</P>
<P>
 Records indicate that Clinton's borrowings from the Bank of Kingston helped 
finance his investment in Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Records also suggest that McDougal's response to Jackson's order was to shift 
the bulk of financing for the Whitewater venture to his savings and loan, 
Madison Guaranty, which operated under far less stringent regulatory oversight 
than commercial banks did. Little Rock-based Madison is now the subject of a 
federal grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons have defended their involvement with McDougal. They have said 
they were purely passive investors in the money-losing Whitewater project and 
had no knowledge of the questionable financial activities at the failed thrift 
or at Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson's statements and the records suggest that Clinton was warned early 
on of regulators' concerns about financial practices at a McDougal lending 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he spoke personally to the governor about the matter after he, 
joined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. officials, issued the loan 
crackdown to the Bank of Kingston. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted for comment, White House official Bruce Lindsey said the banking 
commissioner's action would not have been a red flag to Clinton about 
McDougal's financial practices. Making loans outside a bank's local area was 
"not close to the edge" in terms of legal banking practice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, he said, breaking with McDougal and getting out of Whitewater in 1983 
would have been more questionable than staying in. "In 1983, Whitewater was a 
losing venture. . . . To have disengaged or walked away would have constituted 
receiving favorable treatment from whomever bought them out or let them out. 
Once Whitewater became a losing venture, the Clintons believed they were 
stuck." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton loans from the Kingston bank totaled at least $30,000, according 
to records, and were at or near the maximum amounts the bank was allowed to 
lend to any one individual, according to Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he told Clinton that "you may be hearing from your friends," and 
explained why he had moved to stop McDougal. Clinton told Jackson not to worry 
about political fallout from the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson did not specifically mention to Clinton that Clinton's own loans were 
a concern in the matter. "I didn't think I had to," recalled Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years after the bank regulators' warning at the Bank of Kingston, 
McDougal's Madison Guaranty S&L failed and was seized by the federal 
government, costing taxpayers $47.6 million. The Clintons maintained a share of 
Whitewater until 1992, when they sold their interest to McDougal. They have 
said they lost $69,000 on the investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department is now investigating allegations that the thrift's 
funds were siphoned off for private uses and investments. Republicans in the 
House and Senate also have called on Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to appoint a special 
prosecutor to handle the investigation. On Wednesday, the White House said that 
President Clinton's attorney would begin turning over Clinton's personal 
records related to Whitewater to federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal bought the bank in Kingston, a town of 200 people about 25 miles east 
of Fayetteville, Ark., in October, 1980, along with other Clinton confidants 
and members of Arkansas' political elite, including Jim Guy Tucker, who is now 
the state's governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the purchase, records show, he began using the bank to finance 
Whitewater Development, a venture he and the Clintons had established in 1978 
to develop and sell resort property in the Ozark Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Records obtained from former McDougal business partners show that Whitewater 
had a checking account at the Bank of Kingston that was used by both the 
Clintons and McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1983, a bank examination by state regulators first raised questions 
about the loans to Whitewater and Clinton. Jackson and two officials from the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation met with McDougal and the bank's board of 
directors soon after the examination to express their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he was concerned that the bank was being stretched beyond its 
reasonable scale by loans to important figures like Clinton, executives of 
major corporations like Wal-Mart and Tyson Foods, and other McDougal friends. 
</P>
<P>
 So Jackson, supported by the FDIC officials, told the bank board not to extend 
any more credit outside of the bank's "natural trading area" in the region 
around Kingston. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the local directors, a good old boy who was not part of McDougal's 
management group, called out and asked me if that meant they couldn't loan any 
more to Bill Clinton," recalls Jackson. "He was testing me, because he knew I 
was appointed by Clinton. And so I said it did, that political leaders should 
be treated like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said that a formal order was then issued, directing that the 
out-of-town loans be called in for full repayment within 18 months. "We figured 
if we just told them without putting it in writing, they might forget," Jackson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Barr, a spokesman for the FDIC, said that the agency does not comment on 
confidential meetings between FDIC officials and banks. Bill Ford, the current 
Arkansas bank commissioner, also said that he could not comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr added, however, that such a written directive would be highly unusual. 
"I've complained to banks about out of town lending, but I never felt the need 
to issue a written directive about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he stopped Clinton in the hallway of the state capitol to tell 
him that he had moved against McDougal's bank. "I wanted him to understand what 
I had done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was relieved by Clinton's response on the matter. "The governor put 
his arm on my shoulder and said 'Marlin, don't worry about the politics. I want 
you to be the best banking commissioner you can.' He could not have been more 
supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jackson, who had been appointed banking commissioner by Clinton just a few 
months earlier, the incident was an important test of whether Clinton would 
allow him to operate independently as a regulator. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank records obtained by The Times show that Clinton repaid the balance on the 
loans from the Kingston bank beginning Sept. 30, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Clinton paid off more than $20,000 of the Whitewater loan by 
taking out a loan from the Security Bank of Paragould, Ark. -- a bank on the 
other side of the state owned by banking commissioner Jackson. Jackson insists 
that he had put the bank in a blind trust when he was appointed commissioner 
and was unaware until years later that Clinton had borrowed money from his 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who resigned as commissioner in 1987 and is now chairman of the 
Worthen National Bank of Conway, Ark., says he believes that tough lending 
rules imposed by the state prompted McDougal to shift the focus of his 
operations from his commercial bank to his savings and loan, Madison Guaranty, 
in order to take advantage of the more lax regulatory environment for thrifts 
that ultimately led to the nationwide S&L crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've often thought that the reason he began using Madison Guaranty (the S&L) 
was because he had found that he couldn't do what he wanted with his bank," 
observed Jackson.

BEREAVED CLINTON COMFORTS HIS BROTHER, VISITS FRIENDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton spent Friday visiting with family and friends as hundreds of 
mourners from around the country gathered for the funeral today of his mother, 
Virginia Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 15-minute morning visit to the funeral home, Clinton was seen 
comforting his tearful half brother, Roger, 37, as the pair left the home. 
Clinton, wearing a brown leather jacket, put his arm around his weeping younger 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 With them at the Gross Funeral Home for a private viewing was Mrs. Kelley's 
husband, Richard Kelley, a former food broker. A public viewing followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton oversaw final preparations for the funeral, received friends and pored 
over old family albums. Mourners, many carrying covered dishes, visited the 
Kelleys' three-bedroom lakeside house throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The President took an hourlong trip around Hot Springs with three high school 
friends, walked through their now-closed high school, and drove through 
neighborhoods he knew in his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seems to be bearing up pretty well," said White House spokesman Jeff 
Eller. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Kelley, 70, died in her sleep early Thursday after a long battle with 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and 13-year-old Chelsea Clinton arrived from 
Washington on Friday afternoon with more than 30 friends from Washington. Among 
them were White House Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty, presidential 
counselor Bruce Lindsey and associate Atty. Gen. Webster Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of an expected crowd of more than 1,000 people, the funeral will take 
place in the Hot Springs Convention Auditorium. Three Methodist ministers will 
conduct the ceremony: Dan George, pastor of the Grand Avenue Methodist Church 
of Hot Springs; Dr. John Miles, pastor of St. James Methodist in Little Rock, 
and Joe Wilderson, pastor of First United Methodist Church of Malvern, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will fly back to Washington this evening. As scheduled, he will leave 
tonight for Brussels, to begin a nine-day European trip from there.

RENO REJECTS GOP DEMANDS FOR PROSECUTOR; LAW: SHE RESPONDS TO DOLE'S SUGGESTION 
THAT WHITE HOUSE IS RUNNING CASE IN WHITEWATER AFFAIR. SHE SEES DISRUPTION OF 
JUSTICE DEPT. PROBE. 
</P>

<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno on Friday formally rejected Republican demands to name 
an outside prosecutor to investigate the Whitewater affair, saying it would 
disrupt and delay the Justice Department's ongoing probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to suggestions by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) that the 
White House -- not the Justice Department -- was running the case, Reno said 
career prosecutors are conducting it and that she has "ultimate responsibility" 
for its outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reno left open the possibility that she might seek court appointment of an 
independent counsel in the supersensitive case if Congress restores the law 
authorizing such appointments next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department inquiry involves the Clintons' investment in Whitewater 
Development Corp., an Ozarks mountain property deal formed as a partnership 
with longtime Arkansas friend and political ally James B. McDougal and his 
wife, Susan. The agency also is looking into the circumstances of the 1989 
failure of McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, which cost taxpayers at 
least $47.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegations have been made that Madison Guaranty and McDougal improperly 
diverted funds from the savings and loan into the Whitewater project and to 
retire a Clinton campaign debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate letter to Rep. James A. Leach (R-Iowa), who also urged 
appointment of a special counsel, Reno reiterated her position that career 
Justice Department prosecutors assigned to the Whitewater case had the 
appropriate power to conduct the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "No witnesses and no documents are beyond their authority," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also rejected suggestions by Leach and others that by the time a 
court-appointed prosecutor could be named and act, the statute of limitations 
covering possible violations on the part of any principals in the Whitewater 
case could expire. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, Congress extended the statute of limitations on bank fraud -- 
one of the laws underlying the probe -- from five to 10 years, a Justice 
Department aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, White House counselor David R. Gergen decried as 
"cannibalism" Republican attacks on President Clinton over the Whitewater 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen, in a CNN interview, said that Republican charges of a cover-up in the 
case were "outrageous," particularly coming while the President was in Hot 
Springs, Ark., for the funeral of his mother, Virginia Kelley, who died 
Thursday of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is the decency that we once had?" Gergen asked in a television 
interview. "We are tearing ourselves apart. There is a cannibalism that's loose 
in our society in which public figures, such as the Clintons, could try to come 
to this town to do something good for the country and then they get hammered 
away even though they're trying to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen added: "There is no attempt here to withhold documents from the proper 
investigative authorities, and if it comes to a special prosecutor or whatever 
. . . I will guarantee you the Clintons will fully cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, in a letter to Reno on Friday, suggested that the Justice Department was 
failing to maintain proper independence in the probe and allowing the White 
House to dictate the handling of the case. He said the only way to ensure the 
integrity of the process was to name an outside prosecutor to oversee it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again," Dole wrote, "I urge you to exercise your statutory authority to 
appoint a special counsel to ensure that the Whitewater allegations receive a 
thorough and independent review. It is in the President's interest for you to 
stop hiding behind the fact that the Independent Counsel Act has not been 
reauthorized." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole suggested seven possible candidates for the job: Griffin B. Bell and 
Benjamin R. Civiletti, who were attorneys general during former President Jimmy 
Carter's Administration; former U.S. attorneys Michael Baylson, Anton R. 
Valukas and Dan K. Webb; former counsel to President Ronald Reagan, A. B. 
Culvahouse; and Robert S. Bennett, a top criminal defense lawyer in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole told Reno that "nothing less than your credibility and the credibility of 
the Administration are at stake here." 
</P>
<P>
 In her letter to Dole, Reno said any counsel she named on her own authority 
"would not be regarded as truly independent, and would be subject to the same 
criticisms leveled at special counsel appointed by the previous attorney 
general." 
</P>
<P>
 She presumably was referring to former Atty. Gen. William P. Barr's 
appointment of Frederick B. Lacey in October, 1992, to investigate Justice 
Department and CIA actions related to the case of $5.5 billion in illegal loans 
to Iraq by the Atlanta office of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats criticized the appointment, contending that Barr should have 
distanced the Justice Department from the probe by seeking appointment of a 
full-fledged independent counsel under the law which later expired.

PENTAGON OFFERS SOME DISMISSED GAYS A CHANCE TO SEEK REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon said Friday that it will permit homosexuals dismissed from active 
duty since the Defense Department announced its revised gays-in-the-military 
policy last February to seek reconsideration of their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision also will allow those affected to return to active duty while 
their cases are being heard, rather than having to continue serving in the 
standby reserve, where they have been forced to give up pay and seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the new guidelines will apply only to those who simply 
disclosed that they are homosexuals. They will not affect those dismissed for 
having committed homosexual acts, which are prohibited by both the old and new 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The action is designed to ease the burden for gay men and lesbians whose cases 
have been "caught in the pipeline" while the new, permanent rules concerning 
gays in the military are being drafted. Preliminary regulations were issued on 
Dec. 22. Final rules will come on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, in a companion move, the Pentagon also urged local military 
commanders to postpone any new cases involving possible discharge of 
homosexuals until the final rules take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, a federal appeals court here agreed to reconsider the issue of 
whether the Pentagon's previous ban on gays in the military is constitutional, 
reopening a plea by a former Naval Academy midshipman who was expelled because 
he is a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 The action at least temporarily negates an earlier ruling by three of the 
court's judges that the government must grant the midshipman, Joseph C. 
Steffan, an officer's commission. But legal experts said that the outcome is 
unlikely to affect the government's new policy on gays. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's decision affecting pending cases was timed to head off a possible 
separate court ruling on a request by former Navy Lt. Tracy Thorne for 
reconsideration of his discharge case. Thorne was dismissed from active duty in 
May after declaring that he is a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said they estimated that only five other former active-duty 
service personnel might be affected by Friday's decision. Two other 
acknowledged homosexuals who were transferred to the standby reserve have won 
court orders returning them to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The permanent regulations essentially continue the Pentagon's longstanding ban 
on homosexual activity but prohibit "witch hunts" against suspected gays and 
mandate more humane handling of such cases.

WARY HOMEOWNER KILLS SCOTTISH VISITOR IN HOUSTON

<P>
 One of two visiting Scottish businessmen winding up a night on the town was 
shot to death early Friday as he and his companion pounded on doors in an 
upscale neighborhood and were mistaken for burglars, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A homeowner, fearing that the men were trying to invade his house from his 
back yard, opened fire on the pair, fatally wounding Andrew Peter Devries, 28, 
of Aberdeen, Scotland, authorities said.The other man was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The men apparently were going door to door in the Memorial neighborhood, 
seeking assistance to get back to their hotel, police spokesman Alvin Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the intoxicated state they were in, it scared the neighbors," said Larry 
Hoffmaster, a police investigator at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston has seen a recent rash of kick burglaries, where thieves kick or beat 
down doors in the middle of the night, tie up the residents and assault or rob 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the case would be referred to a grand jury without charges against 
the homeowner, Jeffrey Agee, 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Devries and his companion, Sidney Graves, 42, also of Aberdeen, had been in 
Houston for only a day, police said. Reports from Scotland indicated that 
Devries worked for Nowsco, an oil service company based in Aberdeen.

DEAL COULD BE ON THIN ICE ON NHL FRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If a three-way merger of Viacom Inc., Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. and 
Paramount Communications Inc. came to pass, one potentially complicating side 
issue would involve professional hockey franchises and the National Hockey 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount owns the New York Rangers hockey team (as well as the New York 
Knicks of the National Basketball Assn.).Meanwhile, Blockbuster Chairman H. 
Wayne Huizenga owns the Florida Panthers of the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Rangers are corporate-owned and the Panthers are privately held, 
legal questions may be raised about conflicts of interest in the ownership of 
the two hockey teams. 
</P>
<P>
 A Blockbuster company official said Thursday they had "looked into it" and 
found no problem with the ownership issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brian Burke, NHL senior vice president, said in a telephone interview from 
New York late Friday: "The NHL has a provision which prohibits ownership of 
more than one hockey club. Certainly this is a case which should properly be 
referred to our legal staff because the specifics would have to be examined 
before an official NHL determination could be made." Adam S. Bauman

A BLOCKBUSTER OF A DEAL FOR VIDEO MAGNATE; MERGER: ENTREPRENEUR HUIZENGA HAS 
PULLED OFF A HUGE ONE. BUT CAN HE HANDLE TAKING A BACK SEAT TO VIACOM'S 
CHAIRMAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the $8.4-billion acquisition of his Blockbuster Entertainment 
video-rental chain by television and theater giant Viacom Inc. -- and the 
possibility of a nearly $10-billion acquisition of Paramount Communications 
Inc. waiting in the wings -- H. Wayne Huizenga has made the big deal Hollywood 
has been expecting of him for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected plot twist: Huizenga is the seller, not the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential three-way merger could result in a company with a staggering 
market value of $26 billion, and revenue approaching $10 billion. The new 
company would generate about $1.4 billion a year in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining Viacom, Blockbuster and Paramount would create an entertainment 
giant capable of producing, televising and distributing via videocassette 
thousands of entertainment programs, from such films as "The Firm" and the 
classic "High Noon" to such popular phenomena as "Beavis and Butt-head" and 
"Ren & Stimpy." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Hollywood executives said they are uncomfortable with the deal and plan 
to have lawyers look at any potential antitrust issues should New York-based 
Paramount become part of a three-way merger. One scenario sketched by a major 
Hollywood lawyer would be for studios to seek some sort of federal consent 
decree assuring them that they will have equal access at Blockbuster stores. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blockbuster Vice Chairman Steven Berrard said that the deal shouldn't 
cause anyone in Hollywood to worry. "I don't think it should really matter. We 
need to buy everybody's product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some analysts and executives expressed surprise that Huizenga would 
make the deal, taking what is one of entertainment's hottest companies in Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla.-based Blockbuster and folding it into New York-based Viacom, 
the entertainment concern behind such ventures as the MTV and Nickelodeon cable 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, several investors and analysts raised the question of whether 
Blockbuster, in agreeing to be acquired by Viacom, is now "in play," meaning 
that other bidders are now free to try to top Viacom's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 And they also ask whether a successful entrepreneur such as Huizenga, who will 
be vice chairman of the combined Viacom/Blockbuster, will soon get restless 
working under such a dominant executive as Viacom Chairman Sumner M. Redstone, 
who will have 61% voting control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine Wayne working for anybody. This has to be a partnership 
of some kind," said one executive who works frequently with Huizenga. 
</P>
<P>
 One top studio executive noted that Redstone, 70, doesn't share power easily, 
adding: "Sumner is always the boss everywhere. If you want this to happen, you 
take a back seat to Sumner Redstone." 
</P>
<P>
 No specific succession plans have been put in place spelling out what 
Huizenga's role would be upon Redstone's retirement. One analyst suggested, 
however, that Huizenga may well have a verbal understanding that he will 
eventually run the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Huizenga, 56, was flying back to his home in Fort Lauderdale on Friday night 
and could not be reached. But his top deputy, Berrard, said that Redstone and 
Huizenga plan to work as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chemistry between the two of them is what made this happen," Berrard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others said they are not that surprised Huizenga would strike a deal, 
being at heart a businessman who happens to be in the entertainment field, 
unlike Redstone, whose heart is very much in the business. Eventually, 
Huizenga, whose net worth Forbes pegs at $670 million, can easily walk away if 
he is unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, they add, Huizenga is taking advantage of a unique moment to get 
a decent price for Blockbuster. Redstone needs Huizenga to complete his 
career-capping deal for Paramount. And Blockbuster's video-rental business has 
yet to feel the impact of potential technological changes such as systems that 
will allow television viewers to electronically call up vast numbers of movies 
from home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's getting a price today that might not be there tomorrow," a prominent 
entertainment lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential management difficulties abound, as they usually do in big mergers. 
The deal would bring together two powerful executives in Redstone and Huizenga, 
said Warren Bennis, a professor of management at USC. (Paramount Chief 
Executive Martin S. Davis is similar in style, although the emerging consensus 
is that Davis would probably be the odd man out in a three-way merger.) 
</P>
<P>
 Before getting into the video-rental business, Huizenga built his fortune in 
garbage. Starting out with one truck, Huizenga would rise before dawn to 
collect garbage for his customers. He eventually built it into Waste Management 
Inc., the biggest trash hauler in the country, getting out of the business in 
the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a chance 1987 visit to a fledging video chain called Blockbuster at the 
request of a friend that led him into the business. Huizenga -- who admits that 
he rarely watches videos and whose favorite film is the classic "Sound of 
Music" -- took a look at the numbers and smelled opportunity. Huizenga built 
the company into a firm so dominant that the revenue from its stores exceeds 
the revenue of its next 300 competitors combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood has long wondered when Huizenga would make a big move, looking at 
him to use Blockbuster's ample supply of cash to make a major acquisition, even 
a studio. Instead, Huizenga has been building a series of small to mid-size 
deals, such as buying interests in Spelling Entertainment and Republic 
Pictures, buying the Music Plus chain of stores and acquiring the Florida 
Marlins baseball franchise and the Florida Panthers professional hockey 
franchise. Profile: H. Wayne Huizenga

REV. ALFRED BOEDDEKER; FOUNDER OF SOCIAL PROGRAMS IN BAY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Alfred Boeddeker, founder of St. Anthony's dining room, has died at 
age 90. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeddeker died Jan. 1 after suffering a heart attack several weeks earlier and 
a mild stroke just before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeddeker, a Franciscan priest, opened the dining room doors on Oct. 4, 1950, 
after discovering that when people using food vouchers went to receive their 
meals, they were handed food through the restaurants' back doors. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day, the dining room served 350 meals. Today, volunteers serve an 
average of 2,100 meals a day. 
</P>
<P>
 From the dining room sprouted several other programs for the city's 
downtrodden, including educational programs, a health clinic and housing for 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeddeker was born in San Francisco and baptized at St. Boniface Church. His 
family moved to Oakland after the 1906 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 18, he joined the Franciscans as a novice at St. Elizabeth's Friary in 
Oakland. He studied further in Santa Barbara and was ordained a priest in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeddeker worked at the Old Mission Santa Barbara and St. Raphael Church in 
Goleta and went on to teach theology. 
</P>
<P>
 He taught at the Franciscan Theologate in Santa Barbara for 15 years and then 
returned to San Francisco as pastor at St. Boniface in 1949. He retired as 
executive director of the St. Anthony's Foundation in 1980.

 Tree-lined streets exploded into infernos today while thousands of people 
jammed into cars with their belongings and fled huge brush fires raging in the 
suburbs of Sydney, Australia's biggest city. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of houses were feared to be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 130 fires were blazing today along the 750-mile eastern seaboard of 
New South Wales state. Witnesses reported seeing flames 80 feet high and walls 
of fire miles long racing through bush land. Police said they suspect that 
arsonists set more than half the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, three people were killed in the fires.

PROPOSALS WOULD SLASH FAMILY WELFARE BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking a page from President Clinton's welfare reform plan, Gov. Pete Wilson 
joined a growing list of governors Friday who are proposing that able-bodied 
adult recipients be limited to two years of cash benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In a renewed assault on welfare costs, the Republican governor presented the 
Legislature with spending proposals that, in addition to imposing time limits, 
deeply cut cash benefits, provide tough new tools for fraud detection and put 
aid restrictions on teen-age mothers. The reductions are aimed at Aid to 
Families With Dependent Children, by far the largest welfare program. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's proposals would produce $460 million in savings in the $2.7-billion 
AFDC budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the recommendations borrow heavily from the governor's Proposition 
165, a welfare plan that was soundly defeated by voters in 1992. But this year 
Administration officials said they hope to succeed in the Legislature because 
several of the governor's proposals previously rejected by lawmakers now 
parallel programs being considered by Clinton's welfare reform task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Two proposals that Wilson again included in his budget are getting attention 
in Washington: eliminating benefits for children born to mothers on welfare and 
for teen-agers who do not reside with their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he was recommending steep cuts in grants in an effort to control 
costs, encourage adult recipients to work and curtail growth of the welfare 
rolls. His cuts would reduce grants by 10% beginning July, 1994, and by an 
additional 15% in January, 1995, for all families that included an able-bodied 
adult. The cuts would be offset somewhat by an increased allotment of food 
stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 For a typical family of three -- a mother and two children -- the maximum 
monthly cash grant would eventually drop to $464, the least California has paid 
since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's attempts to impose reductions of similar magnitude in previous budget 
years have been rejected by the Democrat-controlled Legislature, although 
lawmakers have approved smaller cuts in each of the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Wilson's plan, beginning in 1996 all able-bodied adult recipients who 
had collected benefits for a combined 24 months would be cut from the rolls. 
Their children would still receive benefits and the entire family would qualify 
for medical aid and food stamps. State officials estimated that the time limits 
would apply to about 39% of the caseload, or 479,000 families. Similar limits 
are being considered in Vermont and Iowa and have been enacted in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Services Department Director Eloise Anderson said the Republican 
governor's proposals reflect a nationwide move to redesign AFDC to promote the 
work ethic. "We have to look at AFDC as a program to help you work. The 
philosophical basis for AFDC is no longer to help a mom stay home with her 
kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates for the poor called the proposals punitive. "Perhaps the 
governor is trying to make the streets safer because he knows his welfare plan 
will mean more families will be living in them," said Jamie Court, associate 
director of Harbor Interfaith Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the national welfare proposals, Court said, Wilson's plan did not 
include some programs that would make the transition off welfare easier. He 
said that for many families to move off welfare, they would need job programs, 
subsidized child care and in some cases community service jobs. Declining 
Welfare Grants 
</P>
<P>
 California's maximum monthly cash grant for a family of three receiving 
assistance under the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program continues 
to decline sharply. 03,12,07,11 YEAR GRANT % DECLINE Aug. 1989 $694 Sept. 1991 
$663 4.4% Nov. 1992 $633 4.5% Dec. 1992 $624 1.3% Sept. 1993 $607 2.7% July 
1994 $546 10% * Jan. 1995 $464 15% * * Proposed in 1994-95 spending plan. The 
January cut would apply only to families in which there is an able-bodied 
adult.

STATE WOULD SHIFT MORE SOCIAL SERVICES TO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson proposed Friday accelerating changes in the relationship 
between state and local government by shifting more money to counties annually 
and delegating control over a vast array of social services. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the Legislature, Wilson's transfer of state money would total 
more than $5 billion and amount to about 13% of the $40-billion state general 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials and some Democratic lawmakers lauded the concept of giving 
counties more power, but were skeptical that Wilson's budget would give them 
the money needed to carry out the major new duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're optimistic at this point," said Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, chairwoman of 
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. "This restructuring should provide 
counties with greater accountability and flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor took a first step toward delegating authority to local government 
in 1991, when he directed that counties take control over much of the care for 
the mentally ill, and transferred $2 billion to help cover the costs. The $2 
billion for mental health is part of the $5.4-billion shift contemplated in the 
latest proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Also counted in the $5.4 billion is $1.4 billion from the extra half-cent 
sales tax approved by voters in November in Proposition 172 for local law 
enforcement and firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the governor proposed that the state pick up $387 million more of 
the cost of operating courts, and allow counties to keep almost $300 million in 
fines and property forfeitures. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson declared that the realignment in 1991 was a success, and wants to 
extend it to include welfare, health care for indigents, foster care, in-home 
support services for disabled people and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get better results," said Finance Director Russell S. Gould, 
who as head of the Health and Welfare Department engineered the first 
realignment. "As we release and take away some of the mandates . . . we'll have 
more flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The shift of money to counties represents a reversal from a year ago when 
Wilson's budget moved $2.6 billion from cities and counties to public schools. 
Once last year's budget was approved, the governor appointed a committee to 
study ways to change the state-county relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a much more complete proposal, looking at the whole program and 
resource relationship of local government and state," Gould said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal contemplates that the state will provide the necessary money 
through a combination of sales and property taxes. The proposal includes 
shifting $1.1 billion in property tax funds now earmarked for public schools. 
Wilson promised to make up for any shortfall in schools with other state money. 
</P>
<P>
 To help counties obtain more revenue, the governor is offering counties $25 
million to improve their property tax collection systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The state would shift $1.88 billion to pay for mental health, welfare, 
Medi-Cal and other social service programs. The county's share of Aid to 
Families With Dependent Children, the main welfare program, would be raised to 
22.8% from 5%. Counties also would pick up an 11.5% share of the cost of 
Medi-Cal, the health care program for poor people. Local governments now pay no 
part of Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Counties could cut their welfare costs -- and hang onto the savings for other 
programs -- by taking a harder line on eligibility, and by providing job 
training to recipients in order to move them off the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the proposal can take effect, legislators and Congress would have to 
make changes in state and federal law granting counties more authority over 
welfare. Details also must be worked out for dividing the money among 
California's 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor acknowledged that the plan's success will depend on his ability 
to persuade the federal government to pick up the multibillion-dollar cost of 
illegal immigrants and refugees living in California. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, convinced that they can operate social service programs more 
efficiently than the state, long have called on Sacramento to give them the 
money and authority over welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County was especially hard hit by the property tax shift to 
schools last year, having lost more than $500 million. County officials said 
they are seeking assurances that as program costs escalate, the state would 
provide additional money. 
</P>
<P>
 "These entitlement programs are high-growth programs," said Jerry Roos, Los 
Angeles County budget director. "We need to look closer to make sure the 
revenue will be there."

SACRAMENTO FILE: BILL SEEKS TO BAN HIGHER PRICES BASED ON GENDER OF CONSUMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legislation to prohibit merchants from charging more money for goods or 
services based solely on a person's gender was among the first bills introduced 
in the 1994 legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame), author of the measure (AB 2418), 
said research shows that women are routinely charged higher prices than men 
when they buy an automobile, or pay for a haircut or dry-cleaning services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women in California often pay more than men for the same goods and services," 
Speier said. "It's time that these economic acts of discrimination are rung up 
as no sale." 
</P>
<P>
 ASSEMBLY 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Introductions 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy Commission: AB 2468 by Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) would 
abolish the state Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission as 
advocated by Gov. Pete Wilson in his State of the State speech for a savings to 
taxpayers of an estimated $40 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gang Member Trials: AB 2441 by Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) would 
allow street gang members as young as 12 who commit crimes to be tried in adult 
courts. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Legal Bills: AB 2467 by Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) would 
bar the use of public funds to pay judgments against elected officials sued for 
trying to influence judicial proceedings. The legislation stems from $1.2 
million in damages that Los Angeles County was ordered to pay as the result of 
charges that Supervisor Mike Antonovich tried to influence the outcome of a 
lawsuit.

TEEN-AGER GETS 10 YEARS FOR BRUTAL LAGUNA BEACH ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Juan Capistrano teen-ager was sentenced to 10 years in prison Friday and 
a co-defendant was ordered to serve one year in jail for brutally attacking and 
nearly killing a Costa Mesa man who they believed was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey denounced the attack as 
"savagery," and refused requests to grant more lenient sentences to Jeff 
Michael Raines, 19, and San Clemente resident Christopher Michael Cribbins, 23. 
Defense attorneys had tried to portray the Jan. 9, 1993, assault as the act of 
immature boys whose attempt at macho behavior went awry. 
</P>
<P>
 Loc Minh Truong, 55, was found unconscious on a desolate stretch of Laguna 
Beach, his left eye severely damaged and protruding from its socket and a rock 
lodged three-quarters of an inch into the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Truong can no longer walk without assistance and expects to spend several 
years in therapy to regain the ability to perform the simplest tasks. Truong, 
who did not attend the sentencing, says he is not gay. 
</P>
<P>
 The beating, which occurred in a tiny enclave that has traditionally served as 
a haven for Orange County homosexuals, sparked an outcry from gay rights 
advocates, politicians, police and others. 
</P>
<P>
 It also served to underscore the fear that many Orange County gays and 
lesbians say they endure as a result of their sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 After the court hearing, during which Raines apologized for his actions, gay 
rights activists praised the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very satisfied," said an Anaheim woman who had followed the case. 
"Justice happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy also followed the case after prosecutors agreed in August to a 
plea bargain that exposed Cribbins to just a one-year jail term but could have 
sent Raines to prison for 11 years. Gay rights advocates at the time said they 
feared that the plea bargain and potentially disparate sentences would result 
in lenient terms that would send a message that gay-bashing was not a serious 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Such concerns prompted Laguna Hills attorney Eric P. Lampel, who has no direct 
involvement in the case, to organize a campaign that produced more than 3,000 
letters to Dickey demanding tough sentences for Cribbins and Raines. 
</P>
<P>
 Letters came from as far away as New York, Colorado and Chicago. A letter from 
the Laguna Beach City Council was included. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dickey's response prompted additional controversy. He asked the Orange 
County district attorney's office to consider prosecuting Lampel on a 
misdemeanor charge of improperly seeking to sway his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Friday that they have not completed their inquiry into that 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Truong has filed a civil lawsuit against Raines and Cribbins, seeking 
unspecified damages for lost wages and his hospital stay.

GREAT COVER-UPS: UNRAVELING THE MYSTERIES OF HOUSEHOLD LINENS; WRAP UP LASTING 
LUXURY WITH SMART SHOPPING AND CARE OF SHEETS, DOWN COMFORTERS, TOWELS AND 
TABLECLOTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARESA ARCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given that sheets, tablecloths, and towels are part of every household, one 
would think that buying and caring for these familiar items would be a snap. 
Not so. The large array of linens available is staggering and can be confusing. 
Is it better to buy Egyptian cotton sheets or cotton percale? How high should 
the loop on a towel be for maximum absorption? And just how long should a 
tablecloth drop over the side of a table? 
</P>
<P>
 The differences in the types of bedding, dining and bath linens are not just a 
matter of style, but of quality and price. At the top end, the highest quality 
-- and priced -- linens are imported from Europe. Coveted for the use of 
natural fibers and fine workmanship, linens from Italy, France and Germany have 
a reputation for being the best. But their cost is often prohibitive to the 
person in need of everyday sheets, towels and table coverings. Linens made in 
this country -- usually from domestically grown cotton -- may not be as 
luxurious as top-line imports, but there are linens that come close and at a 
fraction of the price. 
</P>
<P>
 January is traditionally a good time to shop for linens because so many 
retailers have white sales. But with all the choices, it can be difficult to 
decide what to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the basics about linens: SHEETS 
</P>
<P>
 Only in the past few decades have sheets become available that are wrinkle 
resistant and so don't need ironing. Because of improved cotton strains and 
weaving techniques, as well as chemical treatments, most sheets rarely need 
pressing. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the new technology came a little less comfort, according to the pros. 
Many sheet manufacturers use formaldehyde and other chemicals to treat the 
sheets and make them wrinkle-free. "You can really smell it when you take them 
out of the package," said Sandra Tobin Marx, owner of Between the Sheets in 
Newport Beach. Her shop only carries European-made linens that have not been 
treated with chemicals. "People buy our sheets because they are softer and more 
comfortable, and they're not laying their faces on fabric soaked in 
formaldehyde." 
</P>
<P>
 The trade-off for softer sheets without wrinkle-free treatments is that they 
must be ironed or professionally laundered. There is also an enormous 
difference in price. 
</P>
<P>
 Thread count and cotton type are the criteria used to price sheets. Thread 
count refers to how many cotton threads per inch are used to weave the fabric. 
The more threads, the softer and smoother the sheet. Muslin comes in at a 
160-thread count; at 180 the fabric is called percale , standard now for 
sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even carry muslin sheets anymore because percale can be made so 
cheaply now that you can buy percale at muslin prices," said Gino Fabbricatore, 
Orange County district manager for Mervyn's.  
</P>
<P>
 The same is true for sheets made of cotton/polyester blends. Although there 
are still discount shops that sell them, the price for 100% cotton sheets has 
come down so much in the past decade that there is little savings in buying 
blends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cotton breathes better and is softer than a blend. And with the price only a 
dollar or two more, people buy the cotton sheets," said Wade Mathieson, 
assistant manager of Bed Bath & Beyond, a national chain of discount retail 
stores with a location in Huntington Beach. "Everything now is percale and 
permanent press, until you get into the top end." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheets considered top-end have anywhere from a 200- to 600-thread count and 
will be made of either Pima or Egyptian cotton. Egyptian cotton is considered 
the best. Originally from Egypt, it is now grown mainly in Europe. It is the 
longest of cotton fibers and the strongest. Pima and supima are cottons grown 
in Arizona and are considered second only to Egyptian cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 European-made bed linens are considered superior because of the complex 
weaving process used to make the sheet, according to Tobin Marx. "It's a much 
slower weave, and the Egyptian cotton makes a finer thread, so you have a sheet 
that almost feels like silk. American cotton does not have the same long, 
stable yarns, and so, even though you can get a 300-count Pima cotton sheet, 
it's just not the same animal." 
</P>
<P>
 Cost is also considerably different between Pima and Egyptian cotton sheets. A 
king size Pima sheet will run about $85; one made from Egyptian cotton can cost 
anywhere from $150 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cost is not keeping some from buying the more expensive sheets. 
"People are becoming more demanding (of) their bed linens," Mathieson said. "I 
think it has a bit to do with the recession. Instead of going to France or 
wherever, they are staying at home and putting more money into their 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now carry supima cotton sheets at 300 count; 18 months ago the top we 
carried was 280 count." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheets made from these more expensive cottons are said to last longer than 
percale if they are cared for properly. If they are not professionally 
laundered, care must be used not to wash them in too harsh a detergent or to 
dry them in too hot a dryer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most (laundry) products off the shelf will eventually cause fibers to 
disintegrate," said Jeannette Tromanhauser, co-owner of La Belle Maison in 
Santa Ana. "We recommend Planet and never (using) chlorine, which also eats 
away at fibers. Borateem or Snowy bleach can be used, because they whiten 
without the sheet having to soak too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobin Marx also recommends Cheer, which carries the approval of the American 
Cotton Council. "Never boil the sheets. A warm cycle is sufficient to clean 
them. And don't dry them until you can smell the fibers burning." DOWN 
COMFORTERS 
</P>
<P>
 "Down is probably the most misunderstood product on the market," Tobin Marx 
said. "In America you're allowed to call a comforter 100% down when it has 70% 
down and 30% can be feathers, including the quill and shaft." 
</P>
<P>
 Feathers weigh more than down -- the term for the fine, insulating bird 
feathers -- and are more rigid. "They make a comforter pokey and heavy. So when 
people compare down comforters by weight, they must look at the amount of down 
that is in it, not the total weight," Tobin Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
 Down is coveted for its lightness and heat retaining properties. Birds use 
their down feathers to insulate against the cold by fluffing them up and 
trapping air between their bodies and the down. Their bodies heat the air, thus 
forming a barrier to cold. 
</P>
<P>
 A down comforter works in the same way: the greater the percentage of down 
feathers, the lighter the comforter and the better its insulating capabilities. 
There is no way to get a comforter made from 100% down unless your grandmother 
is sitting at the kitchen table sorting the feathers. But a top quality, 
commercially made comforter will have only 5% of its weight from feathers other 
than down. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is also important, because down needs to be able to trap air. A 
comforter using baffled-box construction is considered the most efficient and 
is the most expensive. In this style, thin mesh runs along all edges, allowing 
air to flow through the comforter. Less efficient and less costly is channel 
construction, which constricts air flow into channels instead of letting it 
circulate throughout the comforter. 
</P>
<P>
 The type of down used is also important. Down imported from China is cheaper 
and has less insulating power. "Hungarian or Polish goose down is the best 
because the weather is colder and the geese are bigger and need down feathers 
with a lot of loft," Tobin Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loft is the feathers' ability to fluff up and trap air. It's the same reason 
down comforters can be compressed and still bounce back to their original size. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a good comforter you don't have the oppressive weight of blankets, and 
you can leave it on 52 weeks a year," Tobin Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caring for a down comforter is easy, according to Tromanhauser, as long as it 
is done properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Because down cannot be washed, a cover should always be used on the comforter 
to protect it. It is also a good idea to shake out the comforter every day, 
allowing it to bounce back from being crushed during the night. Don't lie on 
the comforter. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a year, hang it out in the sunlight to allow perspiration to evaporate. 
"Once every 10 years have it opened and sterilized. It costs only about 30% of 
buying a new one," Tobin Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
 A top quality comforter can cost more than $1,000 but will last decades if 
cared for well. TOWELS 
</P>
<P>
 In evaluating towels, the things to consider are size, thickness and density. 
</P>
<P>
 Towels are made of varying grades of cotton based on the length of the fiber 
and how it is cleaned when it is harvested. Longer fibers make for a stronger, 
more durable cloth. Cotton is either carded or combed, referring to how it was 
cleaned when it left the field. Carded cotton is the lowest grade and makes a 
rougher, less absorbent towel. Combed cotton means the cotton was thoroughly 
gleaned of any leaves or twigs before being spun into thread. It makes a 
softer, more absorbent towel. 
</P>
<P>
 Towels that are white or natural in color are more absorbent because dyes used 
to color cotton are heavy and block water take-up, according to Mathieson. 
</P>
<P>
 Top of the line towels are usually made from Pima or supima cotton and are at 
least 27 inches wide and 57 inches long. They will also have more loops per 
square inch, and the threads will be twisted, which increases absorbency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The loops are what defines terry cloth," Fabbricatore said. "When the threads 
are twisted first, then looped, it gives more area for the water to be 
trapped." 
</P>
<P>
 The more loops, the thicker the towel. Another type of towel is a velour, in 
which one side is terry and the other has been sheared to make it seem velvety. 
The velour side is not absorbent, Fabbricatore added. 
</P>
<P>
 A bath towel can be purchased for as little as $2, but that will be a small, 
less absorbent towel. Better towels will run about $9, with top quality going 
for $20 or more.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider how a towel will be used before deciding on the quality you want. If 
it is going to be hung for decoration rather than everyday use, a less 
absorbent, less expensive towel is probably sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Towel experts offer an additional word of advice: Never put fabric softener in 
the wash cycle with your towels. It will make them less absorbent. TABLECLOTHS 
</P>
<P>
 A true linen tablecloth is made from flax, a tall slender plant. Damask refers 
to a linen cloth with a Jacquard pattern that is woven into the cloth and gives 
it a glossy sheen. Jacquard is a type of weave similar to the brocade that 
Marco Polo brought to the Western world from China in the 13th Century. The 
higher the texture of the Jacquard, the better the quality. 
</P>
<P>
 But pure linen, which is expensive, is not the only fabric for tablecloths. 
Table linens can be found in materials ranging from silk to polyester. Cotton 
is the most common and considered one of the best choices. 
</P>
<P>
 However, permanent press cotton is not necessarily the best choice for a 
tablecloth. "One of the biggest problems with permanent press is if there is a 
spill, it can become permanent. The chemicals used to make a cloth permanent 
press also make stains harder to remove," Tobin Marx said.  
</P>
<P>
 It is easier to remove stains from cotton and linen, and they are said to wear 
better than synthetic materials. "People make the mistake of packing up their 
fine linens and only using them for special occasions. But cotton is nothing to 
be afraid of and should be used every day," Tobin Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
 Never store linens in plastic as that can lead to deterioration and 
discoloration, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Before buying a tablecloth, make sure you know the exact size of the table. If 
the cloth doesn't fit right, it will look skimpy or be a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want it to fall anywhere from eight to 12 inches over the side," 
Tromanhauser said. "You don't want it to drag on the chair seat."

DIG IN; VOLUNTEERS GET TO KNOW ALL THE DIRT WORKING IN O.C.'S GARDENS

<P>
 Fullerton Arboretum needs a few good gardeners. So do UCI Arboretum, Sherman 
Gardens, the Environmental Nature Center, the Niguel Botanical Preserve and the 
Hortense Miller Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 These Orange County public gardens are feeling the pinch of the recession 
every bit as much as businesses. Like commercial enterprises, they, too, have 
had to cut back on staff and work twice as hard to attract customers. Though 
most public gardens do not charge entrance fees, all increasingly rely on plant 
and gift shop sales and other profit-generating activities to compensate for 
declining donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Public gardens, however, have one big advantage: volunteers. Unpaid assistants 
keep their garden gates open, say these institutions.  
</P>
<P>
 Rick Montenegro, assistant director of the Fullerton Arboretum, is emphatic 
about volunteers' importance. "Bottom line, we couldn't get along without 
them," he says. "I can't stress that enough. We couldn't do what we do without 
them. We need them."' 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers at the gardens say they receive more than gratitude in exchange for 
their unpaid services. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the experience is akin to going to gardening school. There are 
things to be learned by experienced gardeners looking for larger landscapes and 
for beginning or dormant gardeners looking for some dirt to sink their hands 
into. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, being in the atmosphere of a garden is a reward of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A botanical garden is a good place to find out what a happy plant looks like, 
an unhappy plant looks like and what makes the difference," says Jane 
Whitefield, nursery technician at the Fullerton Arboretum. "Novice gardeners 
could learn a lot here." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are exposed to a range of gardening basics, according to Laura 
Donahue, volunteer coordinator at the UCI Arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tasks are different every week, so you learn a lot of things -- propagating, 
potting, transplanting, grooming and general garden care," she says. "Though 
our plants are specialized (endangered South African species), the techniques 
apply to any garden situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardeners of some experience can gain more detailed knowledge, volunteers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine Mabey of Laguna Hills, who donates a few hours to UCI Arboretum 
every week, describes herself as "already a keen gardener," but says she is 
learning new skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning about propagating," she says. "Other than watching my mother 
stick a geranium cutting in the ground now and then, I knew nothing about it. 
It's fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
 For those interested in plants from a more academic point of view, docent 
training offers an education in botany. At the Hortense Miller Garden, 
Fullerton Arboretum, Environmental Nature Center and Sherman Gardens, 
volunteers are given academic instruction in six- to 12-week programs before 
undertaking guide duties. There are also opportunities for continuing 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For those who like having a flower bed filled with plants their friends have 
never even heard of, working in a public garden can provide exposure to the 
cutting edge in plant development. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Arboretum, for instance -- which has a very solid propagation 
program and generates significant revenues from its plant sales -- is always on 
the lookout for new species that will be well-suited to this climate and area 
landscaping needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are plants you won't find at commercial nurseries," Whitefield says. 
"We look for the unusual. We specialize in drought-tolerant species, plants for 
difficult places -- like steep hills -- and we propagate a lot of natives." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to knowledge of bulbs, volunteers at UCI Arboretum are able to 
stay ahead of the pack. Spraxis, Ixia and Watsonia are becoming increasingly 
well-recognized as good spring bulbs for Southern California gardens, but there 
are dozens of other less-known South African bulbs (some extinct in the wild) 
that are equally suitable locally. Helping propagate these bulbs lets 
volunteers learn more about them. 
</P>
<P>
 With any luck UCI Arboretum will also soon be propagating South African 
herbaceous plants.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have seeds from some fabulous South African perennials that have great 
landscaping potential for Southern California," says Brad Carter, arboretum 
curator. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter would like to find a qualified volunteer to lead a program focusing on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And, on a more social note, where better than an arboretum to find a friend 
who goes to amusement parks to see the plants? 
</P>
<P>
 "When my horticulture friends and I go to Disneyland, we ooh and ah over the 
plants, not the rides," Donahue admits. "It drives other people crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every volunteer is quite so plant-obsessed, but people who enjoy working 
in public gardens do tend to be an earthy, unpretentious, nurturing lot, 
according to Anna Pistole of Newport Beach, a longtime volunteer at Sherman 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know a soul when I moved here from Arcadia 13 years ago," she says, 
"but I've made some wonderful friends through Sherman Gardens. It's a warm, 
friendly place, and camaraderie develops naturally." 
</P>
<P>
 The work environment is also a big part of the draw to volunteering at public 
gardens. Volunteers use similar phrases to describe this enticement. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel so removed from the cares of the world," says Ginny Worthington of 
Laguna Beach, describing the Hortense Miller Garden. "It's so serene here." 
Worthington is head of the docent program at the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "A wonderful site," says Michael Lindsey of Laguna Niguel regarding the Niguel 
Botanical Preserve, where he puts in many hours. "It's at the top of a hill 
with a nice view of Saddleback Mountain and Crown Valley. It's very peaceful 
working out there with the birds and butterflies." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Cook of Newport Beach, chairman of the Sherman Gardens' docent program, 
describes it as "an oasis of tranquillity and beauty." Adds Cook: "The only 
thing difficult about working there is leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer duties at public gardens can be as simple and straightforward as 
weeding and pruning. But for those with creative or administrative talents that 
are being neglected or under-utilized, these institutions are eager to put 
those to use too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Nature Center in Newport Beach, for example, could use 
creative people to help develop educational curriculum and displays, according 
to Debra Clarke, naturalist/administrator. "We could use a grant-writer, too," 
she says. "And we'd love to have someone help us design a video." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Arboretum has 18 flower beds to manage; it would be more than 
willing to give over plant design and maintenance of some of them to talented 
volunteers, Whitefield says. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistants with construction, handyman and landscaping abilities are coveted 
by all these institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever talent you have, we can utilize it," says Montenegro at the 
Fullerton Arboretum. "Come in and talk to us; we'll find something interesting 
for you to do."

ADOPT-A-PARK PROGRAMS LET HANDY HELPERS PICK A SPOT 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County's 17 regional parks are as understaffed and short of funds as 
are its public gardens, and they also welcome volunteer help. 
</P>
<P>
 In April the county formalized its Adopt-a-Park program to add focus to those 
efforts. "Our program is modeled after the Caltrans's Adopt-a-Highway program, 
which has been incredibly successful," says Kathie Matsuyama, senior landscape 
architect at the county's Environmental Management Agency. "The idea is to make 
the opportunities for volunteerism more visible and give volunteers more 
recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone benefits under the program, says Tim Miller, manager of Orange 
County's regional parks. "The county accomplishes things we couldn't do 
otherwise because of lack of funds and staff," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 The eight miles of trails at Peters Canyon Regional Park, opened in April of 
1993 and built entirely with volunteer labor, are a good example. "The public 
gets an improved system. And individuals gain a sense of ownership," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they've spent hours out there building a trail, they're going to get on 
anyone's case who's defacing it. They have a vested interest in it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are three components to the county program: Adopt-a-Beach, Adopt-a-Trail 
and Adopt-a-Park.  
</P>
<P>
 The beach portion of the volunteer program is primarily devoted to coastal 
clean-up projects. The trail portion has a natural volunteer support base in 
its users, Matsuyama says. If bicyclists, hikers and equestrians want trails, 
they have to help maintain them, says Jim Meyer, a member of the bicycle club 
SHARE and founder of the Trail Council. "Counties are never going to be have 
the budgets to do it by themselves again." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Adopt-a-Park portion of the program that offers garden-minded 
volunteers the greatest number of possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects can be one-time -- such as painting a park bench -- or ongoing. A 
Girl Scout troop, for instance, maintains a rose garden at Craig Regional Park 
in Fullerton, and Sea and Sage has assumed maintenance responsibility for 
sections of native vegetation in Irvine Regional Park that it urged the county 
to plant to provide additional bird habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to have a garden club help us with planning and planting a rose 
garden at the Modjeska House," Matsuyama suggests. "Or people to create and 
construct interpretive displays. We need tree planters, nature guides, zoo 
helpers." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 17 regional parks is different, Miller says. "Some are highly 
developed; others are mostly wilderness, and some have historical interest. 
Volunteer opportunities vary according to the nature of the park." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller suggests visiting your local regional park and looking around to see 
how it could be improved and then getting involved. The rangers all have lists 
of projects ready for volunteers to undertake, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And volunteering at a regional park is the next best thing to inheriting 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public owns the parks, but most people don't feel that way," Miller 
explains. "Volunteers do. For them, ownership is real." Volunteering at Orange

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: ENERGY-SAVING BULBS CAN BE A BRIGHT IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I'm looking for ways to cut my electric bill, and I'm interested in 
those "energy-saving" light bulbs. They claim to give the same amount of light 
with less wattage, but will they last as long as a regular bulb? 
</P>
<P>
 G.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "Brand-name energy-saving bulbs are a good deal," says Tom Becker of 
Harbor Lites in Costa Mesa. "You can replace a 75-watt bulb with the 52-watt 
version and get about the same amount of light, and it should last as long as a 
regular bulb. You may also want to consider fluorescent bulbs. A 13-watt 
compact fluorescent will give you as much light as a 75-watt bulb, which can 
add up to a big savings if you're replacing a lot of bulbs in your home." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have an odd problem that we've noticed periodically over the past few 
months. In our upstairs bathroom, the toilet hasn't been flushing completely. 
I've tried using a plunger to clear it, but it's still slow. Also, some 
mornings there's a puddle of water around the toilet and the bowl is very full, 
as if it overflowed during the night. Any ideas on what could be causing this? 
</P>
<P>
 T.R. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 A: "I don't think it's overflowing from the bowl," says Rod Albright of 
Albright Plumbing & Heating Supply in Los Alamitos. "About the only way that 
can happen is if the outlet were completely blocked and you pulled the handle. 
I think the water you're finding in the morning is coming from the tank. A good 
way to test this, as long as you don't have carpeting in the bathroom, is to 
add some food coloring to the tank at night. If the next day you find colored 
water on the floor, you'll know it's from the tank. The coloring will also make 
it easier to find the crack where the water's coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've recently seen walls that have been painted or coated in a way to make 
them look like marble -- varying shades with white veins going through it. 
Would that be a difficult project to do at home? 
</P>
<P>
 D.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 A: "There are kits available to create a marbling effect that are relatively 
easy to use," says Joe Ragsdale of Color Center in La Mirada. "They're 
lacquer-based and made up of two parts. You have two spray cans of different 
lacquers. You spray one on and let it dry, then spray on the other, which 
creates the veining." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have an old cherry table that still has a very good finish. At a dinner 
party recently some drops of hot candle wax fell on the table and cooled there. 
I've left them on there because I'm afraid I may damage the table trying to 
scrape them off. How can I remove them without causing damage? 
</P>
<P>
 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 A: "You may want to try taking a small bar glass and put it in the freezer," 
says Bob Espeland of Espeland Furniture Repair in Orange. "After the glass is 
frozen, place it on the wax spots for a few minutes. This should harden the 
drops to the point where they can be pulled up." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'm going to put a towel/handle bar in my shower-bath, which has ceramic 
tile on the walls. What's the procedure to drill through tile? 
</P>
<P>
 T.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 A: "The biggest mistake most homeowners make when drilling through tile is 
they don't use the right bit," says tile installer Dave Stastman of Santa Ana. 
"You need to use a diamond-tipped or some other type of bit designed for 
delicate masonry use. With a variable-speed drill, start out slowly to make an 
indentation and then speed up and evenly apply pressure to create the hole you 
want."

ARCHITECTURE; JEFFERSON'S DREAM REALIZED IN MONTICELLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN BRUNSKILL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Architecture is my delight, and putting up and pulling down, one of my 
favorite amusements." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Thomas Jefferson, father of American architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by the celebration of the 250th anniversary of the great statesman's 
birth in 1743, a traveling exhibition draws attention to his achievements as an 
influential and inventive architect. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition, which opened in Manhattan and is scheduled to travel to 
Cambridge, Mass., and Washington, D.C., focuses on what was literally closest 
to home for Jefferson: the house he built at Monticello. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that should be phrased houses, because Jefferson spent nearly 40 years 
putting up, pulling down, then putting up again this very personal dream palace 
in Charlottesville, Va., that was also a laboratory for experiment. He called 
it "my essay in architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition was designed "to give people an opportunity to see the process 
of Jefferson's thinking about architecture, by which he comes to building this 
important structure," said Nancy Davies, director of the Octagon Museum, 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows you the sources he saw and how he applied them to his own house," 
said Davies, who helped organize the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition gives plenty of evidence of his hands-on involvement with his 
project -- at least 30 of his original drawings, manuscripts and notebooks, 
enthusiastically specifying everything down to the last nuts-and-bolts details. 
</P>
<P>
 A central feature of the house, its dome -- the first neoclassical dome in 
America -- is re-created as part of the installation in the Equitable Gallery 
in mid-town Manhattan. Visitors can walk into and under a model of the dome's 
wooden framing scaled to three-eights full size, placed for display on 
classically simple pillars evoking the building's style. 
</P>
<P>
 The architect's practice is brought to life with displays of the professional 
tools the self-taught Jefferson used -- his protractor, divider and parallel 
rule. Beside these are paint-color patches, wooden roof baluster and bracket, 
and metal-ornament details from the house. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1764, Jefferson inherited from his father's estate nearly 3,000 acres of 
land in what is now Albemarle County, Va., and four years later he began his 
building project. He chose a site on top of a small mountain -- monticello in 
Italian -- with a view he loved. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1779 all the rooms in the original plan were built and habitable. But 
Jefferson's tour as American minister to France opened up other visions of 
architecture from European countries. He came back with a host of new ideas and 
started on lengthy, and costly, renovations to Monticello. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Jefferson's European sources are documented in the exhibition -- 
period maps, drawings and books, many referring to the architecture of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 A computerized video presentation conjures up the whole sequence of the 
house's evolution -- vividly telescoping decades of change, from 
ground-breaking through complex phases of construction and reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Another video glides through sunlit rooms on a tour of the house, dwelling on 
detail, passing through interiors in the elegant neoclassical style Jefferson 
so much admired and introduced into the later phase of the building's 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Large-scale color photos show Monticello as it is today: in polished and 
shining condition after a checkered history that's included periods of neglect 
and financial difficulty. The exhibition features drawings made by the Historic 
American Buildings Survey that are part of long-range preservation plans for 
Monticello as a historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 The house isn't only a national treasure -- it's also the only American home 
ever named to UNESCO's World Heritage List, along with such monuments as the 
Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's professionals haven't overlooked Jefferson's achievements. There on 
the wall among other exhibits hangs the handsome Gold Medal awarded 
posthumously to him, earlier this year, by the American Institute of 
Architects. It's their highest award. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson looked for and obviously found satisfaction in the place in his own 
lifetime. "I am as happy nowhere else, and in no other society, and all my 
wishes end, where I hope my days will end, at Monticello," he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The exhibition "Thomas Jefferson and the Design of Monticello" has been 
jointly organized by the American Architectural Foundation at The Octagon and 
the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation at Monticello. 
</P>
<P>
 It is scheduled to travel to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Museum 
in Cambridge, Mass., from Feb. 10 through April 24 and the Octagon 
(architecture museum) in Washington, D.C., from July 28-Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Monticello is owned and operated by the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, 
a private, nonprofit organization formed in 1923 to buy, preserve and maintain 
the home as a national monument to Jefferson.

 Here are some of the volunteer opportunities at six public gardens in Orange 
County: Arboretum 
</P>
<P>
 On Associated Road at the northern end of the Cal State Fullerton campus, 
Fullerton. Call: (714) 773-3579.  
</P>
<P>
 With more than 20 acres under cultivation, the Fullerton Arboretum is the 
county's largest public garden. It also offers the greatest variety of 
volunteer opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 For hands-in-the-dirt experience, there's the plant propagation program or 
grounds maintenance chores. No gardening background is required. The arboretum 
will provide all training. More experienced gardeners could take on 
developmental roles -- helping create the new children's or herb garden 
sections, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature guides are always needed to conduct garden tours. More docents for the 
Heritage House (the Victorian residence on the arboretum grounds) would also be 
welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
 The arboretum's gift shop is inaugurating a program of growing plant material 
specifically for sale at the shop. Volunteers are needed to help maintain this 
garden, dry the plant materials and/or craft them into wreaths and swags.  
</P>
<P>
 Assistants with construction or electrical backgrounds would be prized, and 
the arboretum can always use more help at weekend plant sales and special 
events. UCI Arboretum 
</P>
<P>
 On Campus Drive near Jamboree, Irvine. Call: (714) 856-5833. An exhausting 900 
hours of volunteer work goes into preparing for the UCI Arboretum bulb sale in 
August, a major fund-raiser for the facility. Lifting, cleaning, packaging and 
labeling bulbs are part of the workload.  
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed year-round for general garden care. 
</P>
<P>
 Persons with grading or other landscape skills can assist the arboretum in 
making the area around the gazebo a more wedding-worthy site. 
</P>
<P>
 The arboretum is also trying to increase its visibility by scheduling more 
public events and will need volunteers to manage them. Sherman Gardens 
</P>
<P>
 At East Coast Highway and Dahlia Avenue, Corona del Mar. Call: (714) 673-2261. 
Volunteers find docent duty at this oasis so attractive they tend to serve long 
terms; turnovers do occur regularly nevertheless, and new docent training 
programs are offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are also needed to staff the gift shop, host the luncheons it 
serves to Friends of the Gardens two afternoons a week and help plant, groom 
and maintain its many annual beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardeners with expertise on the care of roses, bromeliads, orchids and cactus 
and succulents -- all among the Sherman Gardens' collections -- are also being 
sought to take over maintenance responsibilities for these sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Roberts, garden director, says handyman talents would also be welcome. 
Environmental Nature Center 
</P>
<P>
 1601 16th St., Newport Beach. Call: (714) 645-8489. This 2 1/2-acre nature 
center is a very popular field trip destination for students. Staff and docents 
guided more than 6,000 students through its nature trails last year. But the 
center would like to do more. It has to turn down class tour requests due to 
lack of staff; with more docents, that wouldn't be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are also needed to help with after-school science classes, to help 
maintain the trails and to weed and groom the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Creative assistants are desired to help develop educational programs and 
design interpretive displays. Niguel Botanical Preserve 
</P>
<P>
 29751 Crown Valley Parkway, Laguna Niguel. Call: (714) 362-4300 and ask for 
the Niguel Botanical Preserve Voicemail; leave your name and phone number. The 
Niguel Botanical Preserve is a 20-acre demonstration and testing garden for 
drought-tolerant plants. Because it is especially important that 
drought-tolerant plants have an opportunity to develop their root systems 
before the winter rains, fall is a particularly busy time at the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 A native plant propagation program, scheduled for inauguration this spring, 
will also require additional volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The small but dedicated group, the Friends of the Preserve, would welcome 
assistance in planting trees and shrubs. The Hortense Miller Garden 
</P>
<P>
 In Boat Canyon, Laguna Beach. Call: (714) 494-1391. This 2.5-acre garden 
carved into the hillside near the crest of Boat Canyon is the creation of one 
master gardener, Hortense Miller. It was not damaged in the Oct. 27 fire that 
burned the surrounding area. Miller, now in her 80s, has put 30 years into the 
creation of this garden, and the property demonstrates the unique beauty of a 
fully matured garden -- a rare sight in Southern California, where property 
typically changes hands frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 The docent program, led by Ginny Worthington, conducts tours through the 
property three days a week. More tours guides are needed. SHARON COHOON

CONSUMER AWARENESS; REDUCE ODDS OF BEING VICTIM OF REPAIR CHEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you have a home appliance on the blink, choosing the best place to take 
it for repairs isn't always easy. It's important to have confidence in the 
person or shop doing the work, because there are plenty of ways to take 
advantage of repair customers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most common ploys, says Alan West, a certified electronics 
technician who teaches consumer electronics at Moberly Area Vocational 
Technical School in Moberly, Mo., is to surprise a customer with a large bill, 
leaving him or her the choice of either paying the high tab or not leaving the 
item in the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Other deceptive practices are replacing parts unnecessarily or charging for 
new parts never installed. Although there's no scientific way to find an honest 
and competent shop, West has several suggestions to reduce the odds of becoming 
a victim of appliance repair cheats. 
</P>
<P>
 First, you need to decide where to take your equipment to be fixed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask friends, co-workers and neighbors for recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure your repair person is a certified electronic technician or CET. 
Most technicians who have earned this national certification display the 
document on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask to see the service shop. If it's tidy and clean, with modern-looking 
equipment, odds are you're in good hands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find out if they guarantee their work -- a typical guarantee is two years on 
parts and 30 days on labor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider going to a nearby vocational or technical school. The repair work 
may take longer, but because you pay the school, the students have nothing to 
gain by cheating you. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've chosen a shop, take the following precautions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Before you take your equipment to be repaired, find out what it would cost 
to replace it with a new model. If you're going to spend more than about 70% of 
the price of a new VCR to get the old one fixed, you're probably better off 
kicking in a little extra to get the new one with the manufacturer's warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find out how long it will be before someone at the shop can look at your 
equipment. If it's going to be months before they even open up your CD player, 
you may want to take it elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be as specific as possible when describing the problem. Otherwise the 
technician may concentrate on a TV picture that appears too blue, not realizing 
that intermittent sound failure was the reason you brought the set in. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask if there's a minimum bench charge or a minimum hourly rate. If the shop 
charges $10 an hour, but there's a three-hour minimum, you're out at least $30 
no matter how easily your item is repaired. Also find out its definitions of 
minor and major labor. Frequently "minor" labor is anything that doesn't 
require parts, but you don't want to be charged for major labor just because 
your VCR needs a $2 fuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask the service person to call you with an estimate before any work is done, 
and remember that the shop usually has some leeway. If you're given a wide 
price range, don't simply give the green light, because you can bet the final 
bill will be at the high end of that range. Instead, you may want to give them 
a limit: "If it's $40 or $45, go ahead and fix it." If the estimate seems to be 
on the high side, consider asking for a more extensive guarantee on the labor 
-- say, 90 days instead of the usual 30. If the serviceman balks at that, or 
the estimate sounds downright outrageous, think about getting a second opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have the job done and feel you have been ripped off, put your 
complaint in writing to the repair shop. Include photocopies of any receipts 
and as many details as possible. If you don't get a satisfactory response, 
contact your local Better Business Bureau.

 BACK TO SCHOOL: Steve Stenstrom, Stanford's record-setting quarterback from El 
Toro High, says the National Football League will have to wait: He announced 
Friday that he will use his final season of eligibility for the Cardinal rather 
than turning pro a year early. . . . "I've still got some things I want to 
accomplish here," says Stenstrom, a 1989 Times All-County selection. He says 
another year of college football might help make him a first-round NFL draft 
pick.

 LESS GRAY? The Orange County League of Women Voters is already at work on its 
New Year's resolution: to get more -- and younger -- members. There are about 
100 members in the nonpartisan group designed to assure an informed electorate. 
But only a few of them are younger voters. . . . "As one of our members put it, 
the menopause group is well-represented," says League spokeswoman Bobbie 
Corbett. "What we need is a lot of young blood -- men as well as women -- so we 
can keep this thing going."

 GAINING FAME: Weiland, who grew up in Huntington Beach as Scott Weiland 
listening to punk rock bands, is finally being recognized for his own rock 
efforts. He's lead singer for Stone Temple Pilots, whose song "Plush" was 
nominated for a Grammy this week for "Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal." . 
. . . Weiland's known by fans partly for his fuchsia-dyed hair, but also for 
supporting feminist causes. The band's breakthrough single, "Sex Type Thing," 
is a strong statement against date rape.

 WIDER TV: It's not likely to cut into the ratings for Beavis and Butt-head, 
but KOCE-TV, the Huntington Beach-based public television station, is adding 
"The Black Entrepreneur: On Location" to its lineup tonight at 5:30. . . . . 
The half-hour show takes a look at small-business successes by African 
Americans across the country. Says a KOCE-TV spokeswoman: "We are constantly 
looking for chances to serve a wider audience."

BANKRUPTCY JUDGE OKS IRVINE FIRM'S MERGER PLAN; RESTAURANTS: FOODMAKER AND TWO 
PARTNERS WILL ACQUIRE RESTAURANT ENTERPRISES GROUP IN A RECAPITALIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Clearing the way for what would be the largest coast-to-coast chain of 
sit-down Mexican-style restaurants, a bankruptcy judge in Delaware on Friday 
approved Restaurant Enterprises Group Inc.'s reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a complicated recapitalization to be completed later this month, Foodmaker 
Inc. in San Diego and two investment partners will acquire Irvine-based REG, 
which operates the El Torito Mexican restaurant chain and the Carrows and 
Coco's chains. REG, in turn, will acquire Foodmaker's 237 Chi-Chi's 
Mexican-style restaurants, most of which are in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 REG, which will be renamed Family Restaurants Inc., will end up with 682 
full-service family and Mexican restaurants in 34 states. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything went according to schedule," REG President Norm Habermann said 
Friday. "We had the plan confirmed as expected, and we hope to have the final 
recapitalization plan done by the latter part of the month." 
</P>
<P>
 REG intends to sell about $400 million in notes to retire old debt and to pay 
for the Chi-Chi's acquisition. "The market environment is pretty darned 
favorable for those bonds, so we think it will move forward smoothly," 
Habermann said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recapitalization calls for substantial new capital to be invested by 
Apollo Advisors L.P. in New York, Green Equity Investors L.P. in Los Angeles 
and Foodmaker, which is also the parent company of the Jack-in-the-Box 
fast-food chain. REG will remain in Irvine after the recapitalization is 
completed, and Foodmaker President Jack Goodall will become REG's chairman and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 REG's reorganization is designed to restructure remnants of $737 million in 
debt generated by a 1980s leveraged buyout. 
</P>
<P>
 REG filed its bankruptcy plan on Nov. 23 after it was cleared by substantially 
all of its creditors and shareholders. The Chapter 11 filing was made in 
Wilmington, Del., where the company is incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately held REG reported more than $500 million in revenue for the first 
nine months of 1993.

TRW IN JOINT VENTURE TO FOUND MEXICAN CREDIT REPORTING FIRM; FINANCE: CONSUMERS 
MAY BENEFIT AS RETAILERS HAVE THEIR FIRST CONVENIENT DATABASE FOR ASSESSING 
LOAN RISKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest sign of the growing use of credit among Mexican consumers, TRW 
Inc. on Friday announced a joint venture with a small group of Guadalajara 
business leaders to start what is likely to become Mexico's first consumer 
credit reporting company. 
</P>
<P>
 D. Van Skilling, general manager of TRW Information Systems & Services, 
declined to disclose TRW's investment in the new company, called Comcred. But 
TRW will have a 20% stake in the Guadalajara-based concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Pablo Gerber, the principal Mexican investor, said Comcred will cost "several 
tens of millions of dollars" to get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are having to start from scratch," Gerber said in a telephone interview. 
The 40-employee company plans to offer its services within 18 months, after 
compiling millions of reports on Mexican consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Trans Union Corp. and the Assn. of Mexican Banks have signed a letter 
of intent to form a joint venture that will provide electronic credit 
information, TRW said it has a definitive agreement after two years of 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally a pay-as-you-go society, Mexico has no computerized network for 
banks and retailers to share information about potential customers' financial 
reliability. While credit cards proliferated with the dramatic growth in the 
economy in the past decade and the privatization of banks, the relatively few 
Mexicans with access to credit have had to pay interest rates ranging from 30% 
to 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 The high rates reflect creditors' attempts to make up for their inability to 
distinguish good risks from bad ones. Many banks nonetheless have been stung by 
defaults. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, the Mexican government has moved aggressively to increase 
competition among banks and make credit more accessible to consumers and 
business, including eliminating the law prohibiting the sharing of customer 
information outside the banking system, increasing the number of licenses for 
banks and inviting foreign banks back to Mexico after a 50-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Mexican and American banks and retailers will benefit greatly from this 
service," Skilling said. "Obviously, it provides additional incentive for 
American banks and other businesses to expand to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to buy now and pay later "lubricates the economic system," said 
John Graham, a University of California, Irvine, School of Management professor 
who specializes in international business. "Credit cards will do a lot to make 
things work more efficiently in Mexico and to help consumers purchase products 
with greater ease." 
</P>
<P>
 Skilling said access to a quick and thorough investigation of potential 
customers' credit will lower high financing costs in Mexico. "It will enable 
companies to make better credit decisions, thereby reducing their risk and 
driving interest rates down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerber, who owns a furniture store chain in Mexico, said he and other 
retailers in the country will benefit greatly from the credit rating service. 
"Now we have to make a series of calls to a number of banks before issuing 
credit. But with a credit bureau, we will have the answer in seconds," he said.

IN FAR EAST, YEN HEADS SOUTH; RETREAT FROM POSTWAR HIGH GIVES HOPE TO JAPAN'S 
EXPORTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After surging to a postwar high last year, the yen lost a lot of its steam 
this week, giving Japanese exporters hope of relief from the brutal hammering 
they took as the currency rose about 20% against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The yen traded at about 113 yen to the dollar this week -- its weakest level 
in nine months. In trading here Friday, the yen closed at 112.48 to the dollar; 
in New York, it closed at 111.90. Last year began with a relatively weak yen 
and strong dollar. That is, it took about 125 yen to buy a dollar. But the 
exchange rate came close to 100 yen to the dollar in August. At less than 110 
to the dollar, Japanese companies selling products overseas saw their profits 
decline and lost market share because their goods were too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers believe the current retreat of the yen is likely to continue, 
boosting exports and helping to revive the stagnant Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's troubled automobile industry would be one of the biggest beneficiaries 
of a weaker yen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The yen situation was totally absurd" in 1993, Toyota Motor Sales USA 
President Shinji Sakai told reporters gathered this week for the North American 
International Auto Show in Detroit. "It's starting to finally settle down." 
</P>
<P>
 It is far from clear, however, which way the yen will go. The weakening so far 
is still not enough to make life easy for Japanese exporters. In a Japanese 
government survey last year, only 21 of 527 companies said they could make 
money on exports with the yen stronger than 110 to the dollar. But most 
exporters said they would be comfortable with the yen in the range of 115 to 
120 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts say such a weakening is unlikely. "Washington will never allow 
the dollar to rise above 115 yen," said Shokichi Takumori, senior analyst at 
Sakura Bank. "Their target range may well be 105 to 115 yen. The dollar will 
probably not come anywhere near 115 yen for a while yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese economic growth is a key policy goal of the Clinton Administration, 
because it would create greater demand for U.S. exports to Japan. But the 
United States wants Japanese growth encouraged by expansionary fiscal policies, 
such as tax cuts and public spending that promote domestic demand, not 
export-led growth supported by a weaker yen. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen put at least a temporary brake on the 
yen's weakening with a speech Wednesday at the Brookings Institution in 
Washington, in which he warned, "Allowing the yen to slide is not an acceptable 
way out of recession for Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see Japan's (trade) surplus reduced significantly, and this will 
require strong domestic demand in Japan, more open markets, and exchange rates 
that reflect the underlying cost competitiveness of Japan and its trading 
partners," Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura quickly took issue with Bentsen, 
noting that the dollar has been gaining against other currencies as well. 
"Exchange rates are a reflection of economic fundamentals," Takemura said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forces pushing a further weakening of the yen include expectations of higher 
interest rates in the United States and lower interest rates in Japan, which 
makes holding dollars relatively more attractive than yen. Also, Japan's 
worldwide trade surplus has begun to shrink, which eases economic pressures for 
the yen to strengthen. 
</P>
<P>
 Other, more political factors, could push the yen the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 The bilateral U.S. trade deficit with Japan remains severe: $6.1 billion in 
October, the latest month for which figures are available. Little progress has 
been made in "framework" trade talks on further market-opening measures in 
Japan, which are intended to ease the imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the seven-party coalition that controls Japan's government has been 
unable to agree on a package of economic stimulus measures, which, by promoting 
more rapid recovery, might help pull in more U.S. imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers believe Washington could try to force the value of the yen 
upward if it appears the Japanese government is ineffective in reducing the 
bilateral trade surplus by other means. The Yen's Declining Value The Japanese 
yen, which surged to post-World War II record against the dollar in August, has 
weakened considerably in recent days - good news for Japanese exporters who 
havve seen products decline because of the strong currency.

MEDAVOY OUT, CANTON IN AS TRISTAR PICTURES IS SHAKEN UP; STUDIOS: LATTER WILL 
ASSUME CONTROL OF THE OPERATION WHILE CONTINUING AS CHAIRMAN AT COLUMBIA. SONY 
OWNS BOTH. 
</P>

<P>
 Hollywood was rocked by a double dose of management upheaval Friday, when 
Tristar Pictures Chairman Mike Medavoy resigned and Columbia Pictures Chairman 
Mark Canton was promoted to a new position running both studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Medavoy's departure had been anticipated in industry circles for months. While 
the Tristar chairman struck pay dirt recently with "Sleepless in Seattle" and 
"Cliffhanger," he had frequently butted heads with executives at the studio's 
parent company, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and was known to be unhappy in the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Medavoy abruptly announced his resignation to Sony Pictures 
Chairman Peter Guber this week, after spending the holidays considering his 
options. Guber then elevated Canton to a consolidated post managing both 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
 While Canton is personally close to Guber and had been rumored to be in line 
for the job, the news still surprised some industry observers, who assumed that 
his star had fallen with the summer debacle "Last Action Hero" and the recent 
disappointment of "Geronimo: An American Legend." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be an exciting opportunity," Canton said of his job. "I 
also like to work 24 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Canton's new title is chairman of the Columbia Tristar Motion Picture 
Companies, which puts him on an equal footing with Motion Picture Group 
President Jonathan Dolgen. Company sources say Canton will handle most creative 
decisions under the new structure, while Dolgen will continue to manage the 
business side. They will share responsibility for choosing a movie slate, with 
Sony President Alan J. Levine acting as the mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine said Sony never seriously considered going outside the studio to 
replace Medavoy, despite rumors to the contrary. He added that he's "very happy 
with the quality of the talent we have in Columbia and Tristar and their 
ability to lead us in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Sony executives also expressed optimism that the new lineup will help 
stabilize the company, which has been racked by management turnover in recent 
years with the departures of Sony Pictures Co-Chairman Jon Peters, Columbia 
Pictures Chairman Frank Price and now Medavoy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar confidence-building move, Guber and his senior executives 
recently announced that they had also renewed their contracts with the company, 
a division of Japan's Sony Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was Medavoy's last day on the job. Studio sources say that while 
Tristar is on track now, he never fully recovered from a dismal 1992, in which 
the studio's output slowed to a trickle. The veteran studio executive, who has 
been involved with Academy Award-winning pictures such as "Amadeus" and 
"Platoon" during his career and who had a year remaining on his contract, said 
he chose to leave now in order to go out in the most "dignified" way. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, I came here to do a job, and I did it as best I could," he said. 
"Now it's time to take a short break and figure out what I want to do next." 
</P>
<P>
 Medavoy said he expects to lay low for a while as he considers his options. He 
did not ask for a production deal as part of his exit package. Friends 
speculated that Medavoy could resurface in a senior executive position at 
another company. He denied rumors that he will take a political job, despite a 
history of activism in the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the restructuring brought mixed reactions on Sony's Culver City lot. 
By handing the combined studios to Canton, some speculated, Sony will avoid the 
sort of massive ripple effect that usually accompanies high-level management 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 But some people also questioned whether the Canton-Dolgen partnership can 
last, based on past friction between the two over spending decisions. Others 
see Dolgen, who is known for being fiscally conservative, tilting the company 
toward cheaper, less adventurous movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dolgen will be very cautious," said one person. "And that's not Mark's 
style." 
</P>
<P>
 Canton denied the two have any problem working together. He also said he 
expects all of the senior executives at the two studios to remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, Canton and Dolgen will manage 25 to 30 films a year. Sources say 
Tristar's development slate is the stronger of the two as of now, because 
Columbia only recently appointed a new production chief, Lisa Henson. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia's upcoming releases include "I'll Do Anything," "My Girl 2" and 
"Wolf." Tristar has on tap the nationwide release of "Philadelphia," "Guarding 
Tess" and Threesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia's biggest hit last year was "In the Line of Fire," which was produced 
by Castle Rock Entertainment. Its biggest bomb was the now infamous "Last 
Action Hero." 
</P>
<P>
 At Tristar, Medavoy enjoyed his greatest success last year with "Sleepless in 
Seattle" and "Cliffhanger," which was produced by Carolco Pictures. His bombs 
included "So I Married an Ax Murderer" and "Manhattan Murder Mystery."

PACIFIC BELL TO CUT 10,000 JOBS; COMMUNICATIONS: THE COMPANY SAYS IT IS GIRDING 
FOR A NEW ERA OF TOUGH COMPETITION IN PROVIDING LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Pacific Bell, continuing to pare down to become more competitive, said Friday 
that it will slash its work force over the next four years by an additional 
10,000 jobs, including 3,000 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic cutbacks are necessary in order for the company to become more 
nimble in its pricing of services as cable companies, long-distance providers 
and others swarm into its markets, said Philip Quigley, Pacific Bell's 
president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will improve customer service, meet our customers' need for lower prices 
and further prepare us for expanded competition," Quigley said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable television companies, which already have much of the needed 
infrastructure in place, long have lobbied for entry into the local phone 
market. Earlier this week, long-distance company MCI Communications Corp. 
announced plans to build a network to allow it to compete for local service. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission recently proposed that most 
telecommunications markets be opened to any and all comers within three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Pacific Bell cuts, on top of 9,500 made since the beginning of 
1990, will bring the San Francisco-based phone company's payroll to 42,000 by 
the end of 1997. That is significantly less than half its 95,700 level at the 
close of 1983, just before it became an independent local telephone utility. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell said it will set up a reserve of $576 million in the fourth 
quarter to cover costs of the staff cuts and planned changes in corporate 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, it will take a onetime charge of $89 million to cover costs 
related to the spinoff of its wireless companies, as well as a refund to 
customers for cellular research and development costs that was ordered by the 
PUC. 
</P>
<P>
 As with job reductions since 1990, the company said it hopes to achieve most 
of the cuts in management and union ranks through early retirements and 
voluntary departures sweetened by severance packages. However, some layoffs of 
managers are expected, officials said. The company said it is too soon to say 
how Southern California or other regions will be affected, because the job 
reductions will be mostly voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell also said it plans to streamline many of its outmoded business 
practices. A recent revamping of one process brought together in one location 
employees responsible for installing Centrex phone systems in businesses. As a 
result, those systems are now being installed in one to three days, instead of 
up to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been a large organization," said Bill Downing, vice president and 
chief financial officer. "Over time, processes became ineffective." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other near-term moves, the company will postpone management pay 
increases and require managers for the first time to contribute to their health 
plans beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven R. Yanis, telecommunications analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New 
York, said the job cuts at Pacific Bell are comparable to those at other 
regional Bell operating companies. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that they are "inevitable because of technology and competition." 
Improved technologies and automation of functions such as collect calling and 
information have displaced thousands of workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers stand to benefit from the increased efficiencies and cost savings, 
noted Peter Pitsch, Washington-based director of the telecommunications project 
at the Hudson Institute, a think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real upside to this," he said. "Consumers will pay less and get 
higher-value services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like (the North American Free Trade Agreement). You can lament the fact 
that jobs will be lost, but the whole idea of free markets exists here as 
well," Pitsch said. "Ultimately, consumers are better off." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Pacific Bell must take these steps. "Otherwise, people, once 
they have a choice, will go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America, District 9, which 
represents 39,000 Pacific Bell employees, said cuts had been expected. In 
recent contract negotiations, noted Vira Milirides, the union has focused on 
ways to make the transition easier for employees. A $9-million program covered 
by Pacific Bell pays to retrain workers for other fields, she said, and "a lot 
of people are taking advantage of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, GTE California, which provides local phone service in parts of 
Southern California, announced plans Friday to cut its 14,000-member work force 
by 514 management and hourly positions. A Pared Down Pac Bell 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of 1983, when AT&T was ordered to divest its regional telephone 
operating companies, Pacific Telephone & Telegraph, the forerunner of Pacific 
Bell, had more than 95,700 employees. One month later, the California company 
had slimmed to 78,653.

 GTE Gets Reprieve on Cerritos Video Service: GTE Corp. said a federal appeals 
court has allowed it to continue to offer video programming to its in-franchise 
customers in Cerritos, pending judicial review. The stay by the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco was granted until the court can 
rule on an earlier GTE appeal challenging the constitutional right of the 
Federal Communications Commission to prevent GTE from offering video 
programming. On Nov. 19, GTE filed a petition challenging the FCC's rescission 
of the company's authority to continue operations in Cerritos.

 Market Overview * News of unexpectedly weak employment growth in December sent 
30-year Treasury bond yields tumbling, pushing prices sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks rallied to a third straight record close, energized by a booming bond 
market. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 The long-term bond's yield plunged to 6.22% from 6.34% on Thursday. It's 
price, which moves in the opposite direction, staged its biggest one-day rally 
in nearly three years, leaping 1 5/8 points, or $16.25 per $1,000 in face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond market strategists said the phenomenal one-day surge could signal an 
important shift in credit market sentiment. Enthusiasm for buying bonds has 
wilted in recent months on perceptions that the economy grew briskly last 
quarter, paving the way for an inflationary climate that could hurt the value 
of fixed-income investments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday's report from the Labor Department apparently convinced many 
Treasury market participants that bonds once again are a good investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the long-term bond's yield fell that much was Feb. 19, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department reported that non-farm payrolls increased by a seasonally 
adjusted 183,000 in December. That was substantially lower than the 225,000 to 
250,000 gain many economists had expected. Indeed, some bond traders expected 
up to 300,000 more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickolas Kinas, a government bond trader at Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York, 
said the market's powerful surge Friday demonstrated a pent-up demand for bonds 
after months of bearishness. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher rates on newly sold securities can hurt the value of already-sold 
bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 2.875%, down from 3.125% on Thursday. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Computer-guided program buying late in the session augmented the advance on 
Wall Street that carried the Dow Jones average up 16.89 to 3,820.77, its third 
closing high in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow finished 66.68 points ahead for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks also moved ahead, and the Nasdaq composite added 2.53, rising 
to 782.94 and ending the week up 6.14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading was heavy and remained above 300 million shares on the New York Stock 
Exchange for a fourth straight session. NYSE volume came to 324.92 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Board had its second-busiest week ever as more than 1.696 billion 
shares changed hands. That ranks behind the 2.3 billion shares traded in the 
1987 week that contained the Oct. 19 crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really following the bonds and the belief the economy is in good 
shape," said Gregory Nie, analyst at Kemper Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclical and interest-sensitive stocks, such as auto makers and financial 
service companies, benefited most. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Citicorp gained 1 to 37 7/8, JP Morgan rose 1 1/2 to 69 1/8 and Braintree 
Savings added 1 3/8 to end at 13 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 At the market's close, Viacom Inc. said it and Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. 
were merging and that Viacom increased to $105 a share the amount it would pay 
in cash to Paramount Communications Inc. shareholders for 50.1% of Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before trading in their shares was halted ahead of the announcement, Viacom 
was off 7/8 to 46 1/8, Paramount was up 7/8 to 79 1/4 and Blockbuster fell 1 
5/8 to 28 1/4. Rival bidder QVC Network was also halted and was up 1 1/8 to 40 
5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among auto makers, Ford gained 7/8 to 64 1/2 and GM rose 3/4 to 57 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advanced Micro Devices gained 1/8 to 18 3/8 after the company reported 
unexpectedly low fourth-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rite Aid rose 1 1/2 to 18 5/8. The drug retailer announced a restructuring 
that involves focusing on its core business and closing money-losing stores. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merck gained 1/2 to 37 1/8 after the stock's investment rating was raised to 
"buy" from "hold" by the brokerage Nomura Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 * Golden West Financial has reportedly been exploring the possibility of 
acquiring California Federal Bank. Its stock ended up 4 1/2 at 43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas trading, Mexico City's Bolsa index plummeted 59.14 points, or 
2.2%, to close at 2,625.03 on nervousness that the guerrilla activity in the 
southern state of Chiapas could spread to other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>

 Ford Workers to Share in Profits: Ford Motor Co. said about 150,000 U.S. 
employees will receive profit-sharing payments based on the auto maker's 1993 
financial performance.The average amount of the payments will be announced to 
employees in February, and checks will be distributed in March, the company 
said. Analysts expect Ford to show a profit of more than $2 billion for 1993, 
up from a 1992 record loss of $7.4 billion, which included $6.9 billion in 
accounting charges. This is the eighth year Ford has shared profits with its 
U.S. employees since the first payout in 1983.

 Consumers Continue Borrowing Binge: Borrowing shot up again in November as 
Americans financed a holiday buying binge at stores and auto 
showrooms.Borrowing rose at a 10.6% annual rate and followed a 12% rate 
increase in October, the biggest in six years, the Federal Reserve Board said. 
The latest rise, the sixth in a row, brought outstanding debt to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of $783.1 billion. The pickup reinforces other evidence 
that economic growth surged at the end of the year as low interest rates 
encouraged consumers to finance cars and home-related goods such as furniture 
and appliances. Analysts are warning that growth may drop somewhat in the 
current quarter as consumers take a breather to pay bills.

 Apple Plans Newton for Corporate Users: The company will unveil a more 
powerful version of its Newton hand-held computer for corporate customers in 
the next few months, an Apple Computer Inc. official said at the Consumer 
Electronics Industry show in Las Vegas. Apple's Gaston Bastiaens said about 50 
companies are already testing the Newton.The Newton, introduced in 1993, is a 
portable, pen-based device that offers a variety of scheduling and 
communications functions. Handwriting recognition technology is one of its key 
features. The new product will be more expensive than the current Newton, whose 
prices start at about $700. Bastiaens said Apple will be looking to market the 
Newton in the brokerage, medical and insurance fields for mobile sales forces.

 Diceon Layoffs: Diceon Electronics Inc., a maker of computer circuit boards, 
said Friday it will lay off about 160 employees, 80 of whom work at the 
company's Irvine headquarters. All operations and administrative departments 
will be affected by the 14% reduction in Diceon's 1,130-person work force, 
Chief Executive Officer Peter Jonas said.The layoffs will result in a one-time 
charge of about $600,000 for the three months ended Dec. 31. That quarter's 
results will be announced at the end of January, the company said. "We hope 
this action will turn things around and get us back to profitability," Jonas 
said. For its 1993 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, Diceon reported a loss of 
$16.3 million, or $3.18 a share, on sales of $99.2 million. And in December, 
the company was de-listed from the Nasdaq market because of insufficient 
capital. Its stock now trades at about 25 cents a share over the counter. The 
other employees to be laid off by the company work at offices in Mountain View 
in Northern California and in Nashua, N.H.

O.C. JAZZ / BILL KOHLHAASE; CREATIVITY AND VISION MAY FIND LESS ROOM AT THE INN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The proving ground for jazz -- the place where styles develop, fresh 
statements are struck and innovations are made -- has traditionally been the 
nightclub. But if current trends persist, there'll be little of that in Orange 
County during 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there'll be plenty of concerts featuring respected names in wide and 
wonderful settings. But as good as many of these performances promise to be, 
you can bet they will chronicle history rather than make it. Jazz, like any art 
form, needs a laboratory where experiments can be conducted, good or bad. And 
that's exactly what we'll lack. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the live jazz at Maxwell's in Huntington Beach, dropped midway in 
1993? Artists including saxophonist Buddy Collette, pianist Cedar Walton and 
singer Lorez Alexandria extended their craft in an intimate and responsive 
setting. Maxwell's offered a chance to see singer Cheryl Bentyne perform in a 
way that transcended, and was more personal than, her work with Manhattan 
Transfer. Pianist Frank Strazzeri brought his harmonically ambitious WoodWinds 
West ensemble into the venue, and it delivered with one of its most 
improvisationally inspired sets.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Vinnie's Ristorante in Costa Mesa, where musicians such as 
Supersax alto man Lanny Morgan and Gene Harris quartet guitarist Ron Eschete 
combined talents with a rhythm section that often featured bassist Luther 
Hughes and pianist Joe Massimino in unrehearsed jam sessions, the musical 
equivalent of a circus high-wire act. Vinnie's dropped music in December. 
</P>
<P>
 O.C. has always lacked a venue, similar to Catalina Bar and Grill in 
Hollywood, that brings in New York-based acts to display their cutting-edge 
ways. But the loss of spaces like Maxwell's and Vinnie's -- clubs that mined 
the deep, long vein of the local musical scene -- is a tough strike indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead, this year we'll be feasting on jazz-rock bands and world-beat 
ensembles with albums charting on Adult Contemporary radio playlists. There's 
nothing wrong with that. But a steady diet of this gruel will leave us 
hungering for something more substantial. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Coach House, which last fall had to cancel one of its two planned 
performances from young tenor sensation Joshua Redman and guitarist Pat Metheny 
because of slow sales. Coming attractions include cross-cultural guitar duo 
Strunz & Farah on Jan. 21, the back-beat banjo band of Bela Fleck & the 
Flecktones Jan. 23, fusion all-star ensemble Fourplay on Jan. 25 and 
eyebrow-arching saxophonist Dave Koz on Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Mucho Gusto in Costa Mesa will continue to place the emphasis on Latin, 
electric and blues bands. And Randell's in Santa Ana continues to offer bands, 
both fusion and straight ahead, with ongoing engagements where they can polish 
their sounds. Randell's will continue to feature other, mostly electric and 
crossover bands, on Saturdays, as well as a healthy dose of the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 There will, however, be some opportunities to hear straight-ahead sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County saxophonist Eric Marienthal, known for his ongoing stint with 
pianist Chick Corea's different bands as well as a series of fusion-oriented 
albums under his own name for the GRP label, brings in an acoustic quartet to 
play standards at the tiny Studio Cafe in Balboa every Wednesday (currently 
scheduled through March). This engagement, which has run on-and-off for some 11 
years, finds Marienthal, backed by ace drummer Paul Kreibich among others, 
cranking in a way that doesn't surface in more rhythmically accessible formats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cafe Lido in Newport Beach continues to provide mainstream experiences in 
an intimate setting. Trumpeter Ron Stout's regular Sunday afternoon jam 
sessions at the Lido are packed with the stuff jazz is made of: musicianship, 
mental acrobatics and chance-taking improvisation. (Stout's quintet also plays 
every other Tuesday at the Lido.) 
</P>
<P>
 And the chance to see conguero Poncho Sanchez and his Latin jazz band perform 
in such close quarters, as they will Jan. 23, is not to be missed. Remember, 
Sanchez was the closing attraction at last year's Playboy Jazz Festival at the 
Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Bobby Haynes, who books the music at Spaghettini in Seal Beach, says 
he'll continue to bring in a variety of acts, including mainstreamers. "I like 
to schedule groups that play standards and straight-ahead, music that's 
familiar to people, rather than bands that play all original material," he 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
 But until some damn-the-torpedoes entrepreneur opens a club with a serious 
booking policy, it will be large-scale concerts filling the need in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Performing Arts Center's jazz series, which brought such acts as the 
Toshiko Akiyoshi Big Band to Segerstrom Hall in 1993, continues Feb. 25 with 
bassist Charlie Haden's much-lauded Quartet West with saxophonist Ernie Watts. 
Young-lion trumpeter Roy Hargrove and his combo will open. The center promises 
other concerts in 1994, but no bookings have been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts will offer concerts with 
popular appeal, including Bela Fleck with Strunz & Farah on March 25-26, 
pianist George Shearing and vocalist Joe Williams on April 16 and singer Bobby 
McFerrin and his Hard Chorale on May 7. If these acts aren't exactly on the 
cutting edge of jazz, they are at least representative of its best showmen. 
</P>
<P>
 A venue that will present one of jazz's new direction, the Pan-American 
movement that combines musicians and their traditions from a variety of South 
and Central American countries, is the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library. 
The library's Multicultural Performing and Visual Arts Series, endangered last 
year when the county cut its funding, will continue to present a wide array of 
styles and musicians, including Brazilian guitarist and composer Dori Caymmi, 
guitarist Juan Carlos Quintero, Japanese flutist and taiko drummer Kenny Endo 
and Colombian-born saxophonist Justo Almario. 
</P>
<P>
 But the library, which has presented mainstream jazz in the past, will steer 
clear this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demand for straight-ahead jazz is just not there," says Jose Aponte, 
program director at the library. "We just can't present it because financially 
it's not viable." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Weissman, acting general manager of KLON-FM, which has teamed past 
summers with the Hyatt Newporter to present the Jazz Live at the Hyatt series, 
sees Orange County as a place where mainstream jazz is popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Orange County audience is very enthusiastic about jazz," she said. "We 
try to do events all over the Los Angeles geographical area. But the Orange 
County audience is very responsive." 
</P>
<P>
 Though an agreement has not been finalized for the series in 1994, Weissman 
said the station looks forward to working with the hotel once again. Here's 
hoping that plans proceed apace.

TIRED OF DODGING SLINGS AND ARROWS; POP: IT'S BEEN TEMPTING FOR DRAMARAMA'S 
JOHN EASDALE TO BREAK UP THE LARGELY LUCKLESS BAND, BUT HE'S DECIDED TO STICK 
IT OUT AWHILE LONGER. 'I'M STILL ON THE FENCE' ABOUT THE GROUP'S FUTURE, THE 
O.C. RESIDENT SAYS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Dramarama to be, or not to be? 
</P>
<P>
 John Easdale, who has the ultimate say in the question, has spent the past few 
months pondering it, back and forth, like some indecisive Hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramarama's singer and main songwriter says he is willing to make one last 
stand with the long-running band in hopes of finally reversing its outrageous 
fortune in the music marketplace. After releasing five good-to-excellent albums 
since 1985, Dramarama can claim a staunch following in its home territory of 
Southern California, but not the national audience needed to sustain a career. 
</P>
<P>
 On its most recent album, "Hi-Fi Sci-Fi," Easdale and band took arms against a 
sea of troubles. They played thunderously and sang with desperate intensity 
about such slings and arrows of the rock 'n' roll life as drug addiction and 
the tendency of rock's business apparatus to dash a musician's hopes and stunt 
his sense of self-worth. Career-wise, it didn't do much good: While the band 
was out touring last fall, its record company, Chameleon, was going out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Easdale, 32, to weigh his options as he sits in his own Elsinore 
-- actually a modest apartment in a quiet section of La Habra, where a 
supportive wife and three cute, blond daughters form a welcome alternative to 
the wacked-out royal Danish court, not to mention the less-stable precincts 
that many a rocker inhabits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the tour wound down in November, Easdale said, he had decided that 
Dramarama had run its course; that the band had been around too long without a 
breakthrough and, however unjustly, was being perceived as old news by radio 
programmers and other gatekeepers of the music marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been meeting with some apathy, just because we've been around for so 
long," said Easdale, a good-natured, earnest but fundamentally shy man who 
tends to look off in the distance as he speaks. "We're not the flavor of the 
month, the flavor of the year. We're just around. Radio thrives on new things." 
</P>
<P>
 So Easdale had pretty much decided to disband Dramarama. He would stick with 
Chris Carter, the Dramarama bassist who produces the band's albums with 
Easdale, and together they would try to establish a new band. As keen observers 
of the rock scene (they have co-written a regular review column for BAM 
magazine), the duo was well aware of the succession of creative '80s and '90s 
rockers who had switched bands and managed to reap commercial benefits without 
betraying their artistic standards: the Pixies metamorphosing into Frank 
Black's solo career and the Breeders, Belly springing forth from Throwing 
Muses, Cracker from Camper Van Beethoven and Bob Mould reaping sweeter returns 
with his new band, Sugar, than with his old one, Husker Du. But Dramarama had 
one more round of shows to play, a New Year's swing through its home region 
that included club dates in Bakersfield, Ventura and Los Angeles, and ends 
tonight with two performances at the Coach House. The fans' response has 
persuaded Easdale not to give up on Dramarama just yet; at the Whisky on Jan. 
1, he announced from the stage that the band was not breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a loving reception from people," he said, puffing at the latest 
in a succession of Marlboro Lights. "It was amazing. So we're going to give it 
another shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is for Easdale to write four or five new songs (he has finished two 
so far), to record them with the band in demo form and to hope that a new 
major-label record deal results. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dramarama's future seemed bright in 1986 when its song "Anything, Anything 
(I'll Give You)" off the group's "Cinema Verite" album, became a hit on KROQ. 
Inspired by such fruitful sources as the Rolling Stones, Mott the Hoople and 
David Bowie, the band had formed during the early '80s in Wayne, N.J., where 
Easdale, Carter, guitarists Peter Wood and Mark (Mr. E) Englert and adjunct 
member Tommy Mullaney all grew up. The only personnel change has been on drums, 
where Blondie alumnus Clem Burke took over after the recording of the 1991 
release "Vinyl" (the group's original drummer was Jesse). 
</P>
<P>
 The band members moved to Los Angeles in the wake of the KROQ success and 
quickly found a loyal audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramarama had some trouble following up that initial breakthrough. Failure to 
get a label deal led to a brief breakup in 1988, but by '89 the band seemed to 
be on track when it signed with Chameleon and began to build a national cult 
following with the album "Stuck in Wonderamaland." 
</P>
<P>
 "Vinyl" and last year's "Hi-Fi Sci-Fi" were both extremely strong bids to 
secure Dramarama's place in the rock world. When the former failed to do that, 
you could tell from Easdale's songs on the latter that lack of success was 
tearing at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Senseless Fun," from "Hi-Fi Sci-Fi," vented his anguish over having to serve 
the demands of Muse and market. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a nutshell, that song is what the whole thing is about, and where we're 
still at," Easdale said. "At first, it's just love of music. Now, you're in the 
business and trying to make a living off it. It takes away some of the magic, 
but hopefully you don't lose the innocence and love of it. In the end, you do 
it because you love it. I'd still write songs and sing and play guitar, even if 
it was only for myself. It's what I do, what I've devoted my life to." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a fearsome side to that kind of devotion, which Easdale captured 
in "Work for Food," a fictionalized vision of one possible future he sees for 
himself: the rocker who winds up forgotten, economically bereft and psychically 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of guys who put all their faith and hope into the (assumption) 
that they're going to make it, and they don't. I'm kind of like that. I 
bypassed finishing college, and never got any training for a career." 
</P>
<P>
 Easdale isn't asking for riches or stardom; in fact, he frankly admits that he 
lacks the stage charisma of the born-rocker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wanted to be famous," he said. "I just want to make a living, pay the 
rent and feed and clothe the kids. Otherwise, I'd swallow my pride and lower my 
standards and write songs that, instead of being songs I deeply feel and care 
about, are songs my sister, who has pretty mainstream tastes, would like." 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle to overcome drug dependency is a theme that Easdale said he felt 
compelled to write about on "Hi-Fi." He handled it powerfully, and from 
shifting perspectives, in such songs as "Prayer," "Don't Feel Like Doing Drugs" 
and "Right On Baby Baby." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid, (taking drugs) was something you did for fun on a weekend," 
he said. "Then, over time, it became something you did on a daily basis, part 
and parcel of life. With a family, it doesn't work. It was hard for me to come 
to grips with that. When it came time to say, 'Enough's enough,' it was a real 
struggle. It had become more a part of my daily regimen, like cigarettes or 
food -- a very powerful thing. I've had to bury two very good friends who 
passed away as a direct result (of drug abuse). Without getting too personal, 
it was on my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A nervous laugh enters Easdale's voice as he talks about the pressures now 
confronting him, and the Hamlet-like choice he faces in deciding whether to 
lower the curtain on Dramarama's career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still on the fence about what's going to happen," he said. "I hope I'll 
come up with some good songs for the band and it will all work out fine. (The 
recent shows) gave me the initiative to at least give it a shot. I think (the 
other members) would understand if I wanted to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of scary to think of doing something else. A lot of times, 
(what's) familiar is more comfortable. Staying with the band might be a 
cowardly thing to do. But these shows were really good, and I felt there was 
some life in it."  
</P>
<P>
 In the face of all this uncertainty, Chris Carter did what a courtier at 
Elsinore might have done: He consulted an astrologer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had a guy do my chart for the first time," the upbeat bassist said 
over the phone from his home in Studio City. "Apparently Mercury is in the best 
place ever for a Virgo, and John, Pete and me are all Virgos. This could be a 
good beginning of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't put much faith in horoscopes, but that'd be nice," Easdale said, when 
told of Dramarama's apparently clean bill of astrological health. "I could use 
all the luck I can get." 
</P>
<P>
 * Dramarama plays two shows tonight at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano: a semi-acoustic set at 8 and an electric set 
at 10:30. Factory opens both shows. $19.50. (714) 496-8930.

MUSIC REVIEW; RATTLE BRINGS 'DAMNATION' TO LIFE

 Since the last two Los Angeles Philharmonic presentations of "La Damnation de 
Faust" -- in 1973 and 1980 -- took place outdoors at the Hollywood Bowl, it 
made much sense, for this first week of subscription concerts in 1994, to bring 
Berlioz's "dramatic legend" inside, to the welcoming acoustic of the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, it was a good idea to entrust this revival to the enthusiastic 
leadership of Simon Rattle, returning to our orchestra Thursday night after an 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old conductor from Liverpool, now music director of the City of 
Birmingham Symphony, has displayed here a number of times his penchant for 
making lengthy works seem rational and coherent, even brief. He did as much at 
the first of three performances (ending Sunday afternoon) of "Damnation." 
</P>
<P>
 The work has been staged as an opera, sometimes even successfully, yet it 
remains a piece eminently effective in a concert setting where the audience can 
picture its own inner, visual representations of earthly delights, of 
Pandemonium, of Heaven and of creatures inhabiting these locales. 
</P>
<P>
 With often exquisite soft-playing by the Philharmonic, a rich palette of 
choral sounds from the Los Angeles Master Chorale and high-quality singing from 
the principals -- Frederica von Stade, Vinson Cole, Gilles Cachemaille and 
Hector Vasquez -- the sound-scape this time around could match even the most 
fervid visual imaginings. 
</P>
<P>
 At their most impressive, massive musical climaxes -- of the kinds called for 
in this score -- are the result of contrast, and depend on how quietly the 
symphonic and/or choral apparatus can op erate. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, the Philharmonic and L.A. Master Chorale excelled at both ends of 
the dynamic spectrum, without approaching inaudibility at the one extreme or 
raucousness at the other. The Chorale's long tradition of stylish Berlioz 
singing, one begun decades ago under the guidance of the French-born Roger 
Wagner, has been reinstated under the leadership of current director Paul 
Salamunovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Stade, as expert, poignant and text-conscious a Marguerite as she is in her 
more famous operatic roles, dominated the second part of the performance, 
producing touching music through radiant tone and subtle word-pointing; only 
occasionally did her high notes emerge more dry than limpid. 
</P>
<P>
 As Faust, Cole husbanded his abundant resources of tone cannily and became 
vocally expansive when appropriate. Cachemaille's many virtues include a 
healthy baritone sound capable of heft or slenderizing, a seductive 
word-delivery and the uncluttered intelligence to make every vocal utterance 
part of an elaborate but direct characterization. Vasquez utilized his brief 
opportunity as Brander to maximum effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, several of the evening's best moments came in the orchestral playing: 
a transparent, pristine yet solid re-creation of the "Marche Hongroise"; as 
delicate and multifaceted a Dance of the Sylphs as can be imagined; any number 
of inspired solo lines from our Philharmonic principals. Rattle gets the credit 
-- for making it happen, or for letting it happen. Either way, the achievement 
is real. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week: Mahler.

LA CADENA DEPORTIVA PRIME TICKET; 15 HOURS OF SPORTS, 7 DAYS A WEEK -- IN 
SPANISH; TELEVISION: THE CABLE NETWORK IS TRYING TO GAIN VIEWERS WITH A 
REGIONAL, MEXICAN AMERICAN EMPHASIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 La Cadena Deportiva, the nation's first Spanish-language sports cable network, 
is attempting to change the way Latinos watch television. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last decade, cable television has become a staple in the lives of 
more than 50% of Southern Californians. But Southern California Latinos, as a 
group, have not embraced cable with the same enthusiasm, according to cable 
company executives -- primarily because there was little programming in 
Spanish, other than the Spanish-language broadcast stations that they could 
already watch without the benefit of a cable hookup. Only about 15%-18% of 
those Southern Californians who subscribe to cable are Latino, according to 
research compiled from Nielsen ratings -- less than half their representation 
in the overall population. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at La Cadena Deportiva (the Sports Network), a regional service 
launched by the English-language Prime Ticket sports cable network in November, 
is trying to change that statistic. 
</P>
<P>
 So are a few other basic cable channels that have recently cropped up, such as 
MTV Latino and CNBC's all-Spanish news channel. There is also "HBO en Espanol" 
among pay channels, which offers 70% of its films dubbed in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 But because those services are national in scope, some cable operators believe 
La Cadena Deportiva is better suited to Southern California Latinos and those 
in the Southwest United States in general because it is a regional service and 
has a Mexican American orientation in recognition of that group's heavier 
representation among Latinos in this part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the cable industry has done with regard to Spanish-dominated households 
is avoid them," said Paul Laredo, controller of Buenavision Telecommunications 
Inc., an East Los Angeles cable company that recently added the sports network 
to its 54-channel service. "Since 1982, when we launched our cable service, 
we've been searching for Spanish-language programming, and there's been very 
little. La Cadena is particularly targeted to Southern California. It's done 
with predominantly Mexican-type Spanish, and it really seems to fit the needs 
of Southern California Latinos. That's why we're promoting the heck out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The network offers 15 hours a day of sporting events, seven days a week. Since 
soccer and boxing are the "sports of passion" for many Latinos, said Richard P. 
Ramirez, vice president and general manager of La Cadena Deportiva, the network 
carries two soccer matches a day, from Mexico, Argentina and other Latin 
American countries, and boxing matches from all over Latin America as well as 
the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 About 40% of the service features American sports with Spanish-language 
announcers, including Los Angeles Lakers basketball games and hockey featuring 
the Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim's Mighty Ducks. There is also football, 
baseball, tennis, volleyball and golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel executives face significant hurdles. They must first persuade cable 
companies to carry the service, which is difficult because most systems are 
already full. Then they have to persuade Latinos that cable is worth signing up 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 14 cable systems have signed on so far, reaching about 130,000 Latinos in 
Los Angeles and San Diego counties. "There is a severe shortage of channel 
capacity, and that is part of the reason why this service is not on everywhere 
right now," said Roger Werner, Prime Ticket president. He believes the picture 
will brighten as more systems rebuild to expand the number of channels they can 
offer.  
</P>
<P>
 And Ramirez thinks La Cadena Deportiva can be used by cable operators as a 
marketing tool to lure the Latino subscribers they've had difficulty reaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be positioned as an acquisition tool," he said. "To use an analogy, 
we are the Marines that storm the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Art Reynolds, vice president of marketing for Cox Cable in San Diego, said 
he's already experiencing the impact with the sports network, MTV Latino and 
GEMS, a service originating from Venezuela described as the "Hispanic Lifetime 
Channel" and targeted primarily to women. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hearing from customers that they like it a lot," Reynolds said of La 
Cadena Deportiva. "Virtually everything (available in Spanish) up to now has 
been fairly similar. This is distinctive, and we think it will be very 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the draws of the service has been hockey, which before this had never 
been translated into Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hockey's a brand-new sport for Latinos," said Rodolfo Hernandez, one of La 
Cadena Deportiva's hockey announcers. "They didn't know anything about hockey 
and now they love it." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the announcers have had to coin new expressions for the game -- 
approved during lengthy staff meetings -- because some hockey terms don't have 
Spanish translation. Penalty box, for example, is translated to caja de 
castigos (box of punishment) or congeladora (freezer). 
</P>
<P>
 Why bother to cover sports that don't traditionally have big followings among 
Latinos? 
</P>
<P>
 "We do the (American) sports that are expensive to produce because the 
research said that Latinos don't want to be viewed as second class," Ramirez 
said. "There's cognizance of Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson throughout the 
globe, and to hear original Spanish telecasts with announcers who know the game 
and the teams and follow the players is a great experience. People want to 
learn about the games. They really want to become bicultural, and part of that 
bicultural experience, particularly for the male, has to involve 
sports."SPANISH LANGUAGE

Q&A WITH JOHN BEARD; AT CHANNEL 11 NEWS, 'IT JUST FEELS BETTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How many minutes of Michael Jackson's alleged sex scandal does it take to 
degrade a local newscast? For John Beard, the mustachioed broadcaster who 
anchored the news for 13 years at KNBC-TV Channel 4 before jumping in disgust 
to KTTV-TV Channel 11 last month, the answer was 16.  
</P>
<P>
 Other factors besides Jackson mania certainly prodded Beard to beg out of his 
$950,000-a-year contract at KNBC in favor of Fox-owned KTTV and a 50% pay cut. 
Channel 4, for example, had hired Paul Moyer as its primary anchor the previous 
year and bumped Beard from his high-profile 11 p.m. job. He also balked at 
Channel 4's recent policy of making some anchors pull double duty as reporters. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But Beard, 45, made no secret in recent months that he thought KNBC had turned 
to sleaze, tease and irresponsibility in its quest for ratings. In a memo made 
public when he departed, he admonished management: "If you call it news, make 
sure it is. (Example: 16 minutes of Michael Jackson isn't.)"  
</P>
<P>
 But on the very night Beard sat down for this interview about just what kind 
of news he considers worthwhile, KTTV led its own 10 p.m. newscast with 12 
minutes of, you guessed it, Michael Jackson.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Are things really any different here? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Every day there are arguments in the newsroom: Which way do you go? Do 
you have one reporter do Michael Jackson in a minute and a half or do you have 
five guys do it in 12 minutes? One will get you a bigger audience. One is a 
more responsible way. I don't always win, but I feel I'm closer to the 
consensus here at KTTV than I was over there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is that why you asked out of your contract? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't want to get into a brick-throwing thing, but, of course, part of 
why I came here is because I didn't like what was going on over there. What 
they do here is closer to what I believe should be done: more straightforward, 
less sensational, more balanced, more professional. It just feels better. I 
don't think I'm idealistic; I'm not Ed Murrow. But a lot of people get all of 
their information and news from television, and as long as television cuts 
corners and focuses on the most titillating thing, then we are doing a 
disservice to the viewers. These are the people who drive things and buy things 
and vote based on what they learn from television. It's a huge responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So what should you be providing each night? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think you should try to give them as much as you can about what is 
important. I'm not saying you ignore a story like Michael Jackson, but maybe 
you just cover it when there is a distinct news development. At the same time, 
I know there is a bias toward stories that are more dynamic in a visual way. A 
spectacular piece of video of one of those racing boats crashing will be 
(placed) higher in the show than it should be. It only affects one or two 
people, but it's likely to be teased and showcased as a hook to get people to 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So should that kind of story and all the blood-and-gore stuff be downplayed 
in favor of news about City Hall? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Here's the problem. Ideally a newscast would have what happened today in 
city and county government and in Sacramento and in Congress and over at the 
U.N. and on the medical front, but nobody is going to watch that if that's all 
there is. So there has to be a mixture. But, at the same time, you can't have 
the car-chase channel just because people will watch a car chase for hours and 
call their friends and tell them it's on. I understand the forces at work here. 
I don't think anyone will successfully put on a newscast locally that is 
"MacNeil/Lehrer," which is a damn shame. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is that what you'd like to see? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, but it won't work from a financial standpoint. I once advocated that 
we stop doing sweeps series. And we tell our viewers about ratings periods and 
why they see series on lesbian nuns and all that in sweeps, but explain to them 
that we won't play that game because we don't do that deviant kind of 
sensational stuff like the competition does. "We do news, and if you want that, 
you know where to go." I ran it past the guy in charge and he said, "I could do 
that, and we would get beat and they will then replace me with a guy who will 
go back and do what makes money." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So what's the answer? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Balance. You can give them a little bit of sweetener, some spice, but you 
have to do your job and give them what is important first. Let's take crime. If 
you come into the city and watch local news, you will be afraid to go outside. 
What you see on TV is such a distortion. I'd like to see specific crime covered 
less, and sociological or environmental causes of crime explored more. But 
that's difficult. It's much easier to point the camera at what's loud and noisy 
than to put together some think piece. But it's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: These are sort of big questions of news philosophy that are dictated from 
on high. What is your role as anchor in all of this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Continuity and context. A writer or reporter might work on several stories 
a day. One day they're writing about a crime bill and the next about a 
breakthrough in cancer and the next, Michael Jackson. The anchor has the 
advantage of seeing every story evolve over time and can shape and change his 
copy so that viewers get some context and understand why it's important and how 
it's related to other events. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much do you find yourself changing and shaping things each day? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not so much. One of the things I wanted when I came here was editorial 
control, and I didn't get that. But there is input. I'm not the main voice. I'm 
a voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When KNBC brought in Moyer, you weren't the main guy anymore. Here, you 
are. Is that important to you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I never felt I was the focus of the news department over there even before 
Moyer. It's not something I felt I needed. It was more a matter of philosophy. 
Maybe the Moyer thing was a component, but it was a small part. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: KTTV still trails KTLA Channel 5's news at 10 p.m. in the ratings by a wide 
margin. Do you think you will beat them? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (KTLA anchor) Hal Fishman is No. 1 for a reason. He's a solid, trusted guy 
and he's been there for a long time. So if we beat Hal Fishman, it will be 
because we have damn good product on the air. It isn't going to be easy. A lot 
of people have tried to beat Hal, and he's still up there sitting pretty 
comfortably. But I think we can do it by doing a better job. By doing the 
stories that are important to people, the stories of record that people should 
know about. But, at the same time, knowing you have a young audience on Fox, 
you put in some stories that appeal to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Like what? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm not talking about doing tie-in things where you do a "Beverly Hills, 
90210" star deal. But, maybe, after giving them the important news of the day, 
you give something that happened in music. You can't cut corners and just try 
to get the kids to watch, because then you lose the core news audience. 
Everyone of every age ought to be able to watch the show on any night, get the 
important news of the day and find something that relates to them in addition. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you see happening in this city in terms of local news 
responsibility? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's hard to say. Maybe it's going to degenerate even further at some 
stations with all this flash and trash, and hopefully you will also have a more 
solid approach on other stations. Maybe that is healthy. The ratings pressure 
is immense and you are always going to have somebody willing to cut corners and 
do what I consider irresponsible unless there is some kind of community 
backlash or advertiser boycott or something like that. But, if it makes money, 
it will thrive somewhere. I'd just prefer to do something else.

POP BEAT: US3: THE MIX IS BOILING; THE ENGLISH GROUP'S BLEND OF JAZZ CLASSICS 
AND RAP IS CRITICIZED BY PURISTS, BUT ITS 'HAND ON THE TORCH' IS BRINGING IN 
NEW FANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There's no love lost between the English jazz-rap group Us3 and jazz purists. 
</P>
<P>
 "They simply hate us," Us3's Mel Simpson says of the hard-core jazz fans who 
fume at the band's slightest tampering with the classics. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known for the single "Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)," Us3 is high on the 
purists' hate list because its style incorporates sections of jazz classics 
from legendary Blue Note Records and uses that music as a background for rap. 
To the purists, Us3's sampling, the foundation of its "Hand on the Torch" 
album, is pure desecration. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of them told me that what we're doing is like tearing pages out of the 
Bible," says Simpson, 35, who started the group with his partner Geoff 
Wilkinson, 32, two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson wants to clear up a misconception. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're jazz fans too -- fierce jazz fans," he insists. "Purists act like we 
have no love or respect for jazz. On the contrary, we love it and know it very, 
very well. The difference between us and purists is that we don't think jazz 
should we protected and kept in a jar on the shelf. We like to see it evolve 
and blend with other musical forms." 
</P>
<P>
 Like rap, which Simpson and Wilkinson both love. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz and hip-hop have so much in common -- rap has its roots in scat-singing, 
which is a jazz form," Simpson explains. "The rhythms of rap blend so well with 
the rhythms of jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Us3 certainly isn't the first act to blend rap and jazz -- Digable Planets, 
Greg Osby and Guru, among others, have done it too. But none sample the 
classics as extensively as Us3, which is on Blue Note, the jazz label that's 
been around for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have access to that entire catalogue -- which must be driving the purists 
mad," Simpson says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite purists' opposition, the album is selling away. Tom Evered, Blue 
Note's marketing vice president, reports that sales have topped 180,000 -- not 
bad for an album by an unheralded new group that doesn't neatly fit any radio 
format. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz stations aren't playing it, but it first got airplay on alternative 
radio and has since moved to (Top 40 and black) stations and done fairly well 
there," Evered says. "This certainly isn't the kind of hit we're used to, but 
we figured the record had a good chance to catch on." 
</P>
<P>
 When Blue Note first contacted Us3 in England early last year, it wasn't to 
talk about a record contract. The group had used Blue Note music on an 
independent single, "The Band Played the Boogie," without clearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted them to get the record off the streets," Evered recalls. "But the 
record was so good we saw there was money to be made with this group, so we 
eventually signed them." 
</P>
<P>
 A classically trained keyboard player, Simpson is also a producer who runs a 
London studio. He teamed with jazz-buff pal Wilkinson to make "The Band Played 
the Boogie" using an English rapper. For the Blue Note album they hired two 
Brooklyn rappers, Rahsaan and Cobie Powell, and Jamaica native Tukka Yoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put together the music, using both samples and original music, and they 
write their own raps," Simpson says. 
</P>
<P>
 One aspect of the success of the album -- also a hit in Japan and parts of 
Europe -- particularly thrills Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Note people tell us that young music fans who weren't really into jazz 
have been buying Blue Note classics because of our record," he says. "We're 
really doing our part to keep jazz alive -- in spite of what the purists 
think."

 Wally George, punk rocker? 
</P>
<P>
 The irascible right-wing TV talk show host will be the master of ceremonies 
for an upcoming night of punk rock at the Ice House in Fullerton, and word is 
he'll even be singing with one of the bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "Wally George's Outrageous Rock Shindig," the concert Jan. 28 will find 
George presiding over a bill of five grass-roots Orange County bands: Sublime, 
Guttermouth, Nuckle Brothers, One Eye Open and Game Face. The show's promoter, 
John Pantle, said that his band, the Nuckle Brothers, will serve as George's 
backup for a rendition of the blues chestnut "Kansas City." 
</P>
<P>
 Pantle said George will feature the bands on his "Hot Seat With Wally George" 
program on KDOC Channel 56 as a prelude to the concert. Advance tickets are on 
sale at Bionic Records in Huntington Beach, Cypress and Fullerton. Information:

 Boss Song: Pop star Bruce Springsteen says he agreed to write the opening song 
to the movie "Philadelphia" to help the film's message of tolerance and 
compassion for people with AIDS reach a broad audience. "(Director Jonathan) 
Demme called me and said, 'I made this picture and I want it to play in the 
malls,' " said the singer. "I'm some salt on the steak." Springsteen, whose 
song is called "Streets of Philadelphia," added: "I think the picture is great, 
and there's an audience waiting for it. The country is waiting for something 
that's going to address these questions of tolerance and of how people are 
going to live together in the future." STAGE

best picture Oscar, will be presented for the first time in Dolby Stereo and 
using new prints struck from the original negative. The film, which stars Jon 
Voight and Dustin Hoffman, will open Feb. 24 at the two theaters where it first 
played for over a year: the Mann Bruin in L.A. and N.Y.'s Baronet. MUSIC

 Plea for Help: American opera star Barbara Hendricks, who gave a New Year's 
concert in Sarajevo, appealed Friday to President Clinton to "stop the 
barbarism" in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Arkansas native urged the President to 
visit Sarajevo. "One can never be prepared for the reality of everyday life 
here," she said in a letter to Clinton and U.N. Secretary-General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali. "You must see it with your own eyes." TELEVISION

 Fox Goes Local: Fox Broadcasting Co. announced that beginning Jan. 31, its 
affiliates will temporarily present their own choice of programming in the 
network's beleaguered late-night time period (11 p.m.-midnight). The affiliates 
will resume network broadcasts upon the launch of a new Fox late-night program. 
Since the demise of "The Chevy Chase Show" last fall, Fox has been airing 
repeats of "In Living Color" and "Code 3" in the time period.

 * 'Homicide' Ratings Soar: Robin Williams fired up the ratings Thursday night 
on the second-season premiere of NBC's Emmy Award-winning series "Homicide: 
Life on the Street." The acclaimed cop drama, which did not catch on with 
viewers last season, received an 18 rating and 28 share of the audience, 
according to overnight Nielsen Media Research ratings. "Homicide" soundly beat 
its competition: ABC's "PrimeTime Live," which had a 13.7 rating, 22 share, and 
CBS' "Second Chances," which scored a 7.1 rating, 11 share. For the 29 markets 
measured, one ratings point equals 476,572 homes.

 * Post-Super Bowl Fare: NBC will air episodes of its Tuesday evening sitcoms, 
"The Good Life" and "The John Larroquette Show," immediately following its 
telecast of Super Bowl XXVIII on Jan. 30. The post-game slot, considered a plum 
because of the huge built-in audience, has often been used for series 
premieres. NBC opted against debuting a show this year, instead trying to give 
wider sampling to the two first-year comedies, which find themselves in 
difficult time periods. QUICK TAKES

UA THEATERS OFFICIAL CALLS SHOOTING 'ISOLATED CASE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 An official at United Artists Theaters on Friday defended security measures at 
the nationwide chain, a day after a woman watching "Schindler's List" was shot 
and wounded by a man sitting behind her in the audience at a downtown San Diego 
movie theater. The shooting touched off panic among many patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very isolated type of case," said Ray Nutt, vice president of 
corporate operations. "There isn't anything I foresee that United Artists could 
have done to prevent this situation." He declined to discuss what security 
measures were being employed but said there were no plans to install metal 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred during scenes of graphic Nazi violence in the critically 
acclaimed Steven Spielberg film on the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the suspect as James Michael Kirby, 45, of San Diego. Kirby 
was arrested late Thursday afternoon in the San Diego-area community of La Mesa 
for driving erratically. Police said that a routine check of his name showed he 
is the owner of the gun used in the theater shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were unsure of the shooter's motives. Irene Kirby, the mother of the 
suspect, said Friday that she was with her son when the gun went off and that 
the shooting happened accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she and her son were separated during the pandemonium that followed 
the gunfire but met up later at their car and left the mall without meeting 
with authorities. Her son was alone when he was arrested about four hours after 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the shooting could have been accidental, San Diego Police Lt. Jim 
Collins said simply: "The man has been charged with assault with a deadly 
weapon and will remain in custody." Jail authorities noted that Kirby's bail 
was increased on Friday afternoon to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, new details emerged Friday about the alleged shooter. Phillip Gay, 
a sociology professor at San Diego State University, told The Times on Friday 
that he was the target of a death threat Kirby made against him during the 
recently concluded fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay had given Kirby a failing grade in a course titled "Sociology of Mass 
Communications and Popular Culture." He said the student telephoned him and 
said: "I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to intimidate me. Well, 
let me tell you your days are numbered." 
</P>
<P>
 Gay said he reported what he perceived as a death threat to the school's 
campus police department, which launched an investigation that was then 
curtailed when the professor declined to pursue the matter further. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus police offered Gay bodyguard protection and urged him to report the 
matter to the San Diego Police Department, but he chose not to, saying he 
feared the attention it would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 "But having read what happened in the movie theater, I'm sorry now that I 
didn't pursue the matter further," Gay said. "If they had at least contacted 
him, he would have known somebody was watching him, was aware of his behavior. 
. . . If I had it to do over again, I'd follow through on a complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Collins said Friday that his department was pursuing the professor's 
allegation. Collins said Kirby remains in custody in San Diego County Jail, 
booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said Kirby fired a single round from a .38-caliber handgun that 
penetrated the back of the seat in front of him and critically injured 
40-year-old secretary Ellen Campbell. After hours of surgery, her condition was 
upgraded to serious early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said the shooting occurred at the moment in "Schindler's List" when a 
wave of gunshot executions to the head was occurring in scenes that depict the 
Nazis' brutal liquidation of a Jewish ghetto in Krakow, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish leaders and officials at Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment said that 
until there was more information, it was too early to speculate if the shooting 
was a hate-generated crime or if the violence on the screen could have moved 
someone to violence in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a gang-type movie," said Marvin Levy, a marketing consultant for 
Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, referring to a genre that has led to violent 
incidents at theaters in the past. "If ever there was a film totally different 
from that, it certainly is this." He said that at some theaters, moviegoers 
have actually remained silent in their seats -- as if in a church -- as the end 
credits roll by because of the emotional tug of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said 
there have been no reports elsewhere of "Schindler's List"-related incidents of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, theater officials said they believed their security was sufficient 
to protect its patrons, although they would not spell out what that security 
entailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if they would ever install metal detectors like those used at airports 
to prevents guns from being brought onto airplanes, UA Vice President Nutt 
said: "No, I think that takes away from the entertainment experience. United 
Artists certainly doesn't have plans to install metal detectors." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, some patrons on Thursday criticized the company for not 
shutting down the theater at the popular Horton Plaza shopping mall downtown 
after the shooting. Movies such as "The Pelican Brief," "Sister Act 2" and "The 
Air Up There" continued showing even as police investigated the shooting scene, 
and "Schindler's List" resumed shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a decision to continue showing the film," UA's Nutt said. "There was 
really nothing to it. I believe this was a very isolated incident. . . . It's 
very rare that we have something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 United Artists has 420 theaters around the country, with 2,300 screens. 
</P>

NO 'BADGES' AT IRVINE BARCLAY -- TOUR IS CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 El Teatro Campesino has canceled its national touring version of Luis Valdez's 
"I Don't Have to Show You No Stinking Badges!" which was due Feb. 16 at the 
Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told they have encountered financial difficulties and because of that 
could not go on with their national tour," Irvine Barclay President Douglas C. 
Rankin said Friday.The production was to have been part of the Irvine Barclay's 
1994 theater subscription series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northern California-based company, which is headquartered in San Juan 
Bautista, could not be reached. A recorded message Friday afternoon said its 
office was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for California Artists Management in San Francisco, which 
booked the national tour, confirmed that it had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Teatro Campesino production was a revival of Valdez's 1986 play. 
Valdez, who founded the company, is perhaps best known for "Zoot Suit." 
</P>
<P>
 A new play of his, "Bandido," is scheduled to have its world premiere June 9 
at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. "I don't think our production will be 
affected by this development," Taper spokesman Ken Werther said Friday. "There 
has been no indication of that to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Rankin said the Irvine Barclay would be mailing notices of the cancellation 
today and would be offering refunds. The other production in the Irvine Barclay 
series -- "Gray's Anatomy," a monologue by Spalding Gray -- is still expected 
at the theater May 1 for a one-night engagement.

JAZZ NOTES: NEW YEAR PROMISES SLEW OF FIRST-RATE RECORDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray burning up "The Chase," Gene Ammons and Sonny 
Stitt locking horns on "Blues Up and Down" -- these are two examples of classic 
musical collaborations between ace tenor saxophonists. 
</P>
<P>
 The teaming up of Joe Lovano, perhaps the top young veteran tenorman, and 
Joshua Redman, the hottest rising star of the saxophone, promises to be another 
timeless matchup. On Lovano's "Tenor Legacy," the pair play tunes such as "Love 
Is a Many Splendored Thing," Monk's "Introspection" and David Raksin's "Laura." 
The album, due out next month from Blue Note, features a crack rhythm section 
of pianist Mulgrew Miller, bassist Christian McBride and drummer Lewis Nash. 
It's but one of what promises to be many first-rate releases in the first few 
months of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Things get rolling this month with the Contemporary Piano Ensemble's "The Key 
Players" (DIW), a project devised by pianist James Williams that is dedicated 
to the late Phineas Newborn Jr. and that finds that Memphis native performing 
in a four-piano group that also includes Harold Mabern, Mulgrew Miller and 
Geoff Keezer.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the elder statesman of piano, Hank Jones, making a rare 
appearance with his younger brother, drummer Elvin Jones, on "Upon Reflection" 
(Verve), which spotlights the music of yet another Jones, their late great 
brother, trumpeter and composer Thad. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy Tyner's "Journey" (Verve) is the big band follow to his Grammy winner of 
last year, "The Turning Point." Due out this month, "Journey" is highlighted by 
a remake of the splendid Tyner composition "Peresina," which fans of the 
pianist recall from his outstanding late '60s Blue Note album "Tender Moments." 
</P>
<P>
 In February, you can look for a new session by bassist Charlie Haden's Quartet 
West, as the leader, pianist Alan Broadbent, saxman Ernie Watts and drummer 
Larance Marable continue their investigation of music of the '40s and '50s, 
such as Bud Powell's "Celia," as well as contemporary originals. Also set for 
February release is English saxophonist Andy Sheppard's Blue Note debut, 
"Rhythm Method," an album that showcases ace trumpeter Claude Deppa on 
distinctive, rhythmically punchy numbers by Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian singer-composer Milton Nascimento's "Angelus" (Warner Bros.) will 
also hit the streets in February. The album features cameos from saxman Wayne 
Shorter, pianist Herbie Hancock and singers James Taylor and Peter Gabriel. 
Also in a Brazilian vein is Sarah Vaughan's "I Love Brazil," a long unavailable 
Pablo album finally being reissued, and including two bonus tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianists Kenny Barron and Tommy Flanagan both have Verve releases on the 
schedule. Barron's "Other Places" spotlights vibist Bobby Hutcherson and 
tenorist Ralph Moore, while Flanagan's "Lady Be Good . . . For Ella" is a 
tribute to Fitzgerald, by the pianist who served as her accompanist for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 March marks releases by Branford Marsalis, Terence Blanchard, the Miles Davis 
Tribute band and John Scofield and Pat Metheny. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis' Columbia album, which remains untitled, will be the saxophonist's 
version of a hip-hop/jazz album, with input from pianist Kenny Kirkland, 
drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts and rapper DJ Premier from the group Gangstar. In 
contrast, Blanchard will explore an earlier era on "In My Solitude: The Billie 
Holiday Songbook" (Columbia), his fat, sassy trumpet tone accompanied by a 
string section. 
</P>
<P>
 Another look at jazz past, but with a modern viewpoint, will be "A Tribute to 
Miles Davis" (Qwest/Reprise), featuring Shorter, Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, 
drummer Tony Williams -- who all played with Davis at one time -- and trumpeter 
Wallace Roney.  
</P>
<P>
 Critic's Choice: Benny Green comes to town next week, appearing at Santa 
Monica College at noon on Tuesday, and beginning a six-day stand at Catalina 
Bar & Grill that night. As he'll be working with bass great Christian McBride 
and drummer Kenny Washington, expect nothing less than first-rate trio jazz.

ART REVIEWS; A VISIT TO AN EXPANDED NOTION OF PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "About Place," a group exhibition at the Municipal Art Gallery and the Junior 
Arts Center is among the first of the interim year projects sponsored by the 
biennale "LAX: The Los Angeles Exhibition." As far as large-scale "theme" shows 
go, this one is about as wide open as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
 The art assembled here deals with an expanded -- indeed, elastic -- notion of 
place: in terms of memory, fantasy, history, light, space and time. (This is 
only a partial list.) Surprisingly, it works -- not because of an intelligible 
curatorial vision, but because the quality of the eight individual 
installations is, on the whole, quite high. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few exceptions. Lilla LoCurto and William H. Outcault's 
interactive installation attempts to dramatize the inevitably flawed nature of 
communication. Their piece, however, is interesting only on a theoretical 
level. Practically, it is untenable, as it hinges upon the simultaneous 
participation of three visitors, leaving most unaccompanied viewers frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Nishio's "Meta-Tation Gym" -- a simulated aerobics studio complete with 
mats, towels and T-shirts embossed with queries about existential crisis -- is 
operatic in terms of its ambitions, but bogged down by equal parts glibness and 
triteness. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise consumed by a taste for the operatic is Erika Suderberg's darkened 
chamber filled with illuminated paving stones, each collaged with images and 
texts. It conjures the cemetery, as well as the grid-like structure of urban 
space. It is, however, also overblown and thin. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the installations, by contrast, sacrifice neither conceptual rigor 
nor poetry. Linda Hudson's whispered evocation of the perspectival logic of the 
gallery is emblematic. A gazing ball, a transparent image and hundreds of 
mirrored squares trap, reverse, erase and expand the light that carves the 
cruciform space. As in her finest work, Hudson reconciles asceticism and 
luxury, geometry and seduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline Stella Sanchez's poetry is more absurdist. Like peregrinations within 
the mind's (crossed) eye, a massive circle of drawings on the floor wanders 
between doodled molecules and precise spatial renderings. In the center of all 
this rises a crown dripping with mushrooms, painted a neon yellow, like a sty 
on the eye or a ghost in the machine. Hanging on the wall is a single painting 
in the same neon yellow -- a retinal afterimage, perhaps, or more likely a 
mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 T. Kelly Mason's installation eschews mirages, and engages directly with the 
history of Olive Hill, where Barnsdall is located. As such, it is a model of 
site-specific work. A large, free-standing wall leaning against the gallery 
wall creates a triangular niche filled with abstract drawings based on 
architect Frank Lloyd Wright's hollyhock motif. This is the protected space of 
reverie and creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, a series of self-consciously complex flow-charts attempts to make 
into science Wright's individualist philosophy and patron Aline Barnsdall's 
demands on behalf of the community. This is the public sphere of rationality 
and compromise. For Mason, architectural space has its own realities; yet 
perhaps more important, it is a frame for psychological, sociological and 
ideological space. Mason's notion of "place" is both literal and metaphoric, 
private and expansive.

 Compulsion to Repeat: Upon first glance, it seems as though Rodney Graham has 
pulled off a perfectly wicked Donald Judd imitation: a horizontal, shelf-like 
structure in gleaming blue lacquer on wood, as unexpressive an object as they 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look reveals a copy of Sigmund Freud's "Jokes and Their Relation to 
the Unconscious" sandwiched into the sculpture. Judd's literalist space is 
assaulted by the mind's messy, metaphoric depths; or, alternately, Freud's 
living treatise is forever trapped within the fossilized space of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Freud, Graham is enamored of all species of perversity and only the most 
elegant of systems. His work, currently on view at Angles Gallery, enacts 
Freud's notion of "the compulsion to repeat," transforming this compulsion into 
a game in which Graham is always the winner, always in control. 
</P>
<P>
 One knows, of course, what Freud would say about this particular kind of 
delusion, but Graham pays no mind. No text is sacrosanct to him, not even 
Freud's Standard Edition, into which he once slipped his own, four-page insert. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, it is C. R. Mueller's translation of George Buchner's obscure novella 
"Lenz," which Graham subjects to his eccentric systematics. Graham discovered 
that in the first few pages of the story there are two occasions of the phrase 
"through the forest." By typesetting the first 1,434 words of Mueller's 
translation so that they fall on five justified pages, with the first 
occurrence of the phrase falling at the end of Page 1, and the second 
occurrence at the end of Page 5, Graham creates a textual loop in which Page 5 
may be forever joined to Page 2 thus short-circuiting the text and condemning 
poor Lenz to wander the snowy forest in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham's "Machine for Reading Lenz" is a wood-and-brass mechanism in which the 
five pages are pressed between pieces of hinged glass, which can be spun on 
their axes, as self-contained as a globe. Typical of Graham's work, the 
"Machine" is hysterical, claustrophobic, yet inviting. Indeed, Freud once noted 
that hysterics (as well as impostors) love to draw others into their delusional 
systems.

NBC EXTENDS LENO'S 'TONIGHT' CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jay Leno got a vote of confidence from NBC Friday as the network announced 
that it has extended his multiyear agreement to continue hosting "The Tonight 
Show," with a pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield praised Leno, saying he had 
performed well in the crowded and competitive late-night field, which is now 
led by CBS' "Late Show With David Letterman." He said that ratings for "The 
Tonight Show" are as strong as before Letterman joined the 11:35 p.m. fray. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Pasadena, Littlefield declined to be specific about 
Leno's contract, saying simply, "We had an option coming up in March and we sat 
down and we decided to keep going for several years." Leno, however, indicated 
that the extension was for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno said he felt that the competition from Letterman and from "Nightline's" 
Ted Koppel had made him and his show better. "I feel looser. We're doing more 
comedy, more remotes and lots of different things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NBC also announced that it will continue the popular "Perry Mason" mystery 
franchise even though star Raymond Burr passed away last year, with guest stars 
brought in to take the lead defense counsel role. The first of these will be 
Hal Holbrook, portraying a former associate of Mason's who returns to the law 
firm to defend a murder suspect. The movie will note that the Mason character 
has died, Littlefield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the network said it has acquired the exclusive rights from Republic 
Pictures to the classic 1946 film "It's a Wonderful Life" and will begin airing 
it as a holiday perennial in 1995. The movie, which stars Jimmy Stewart, will 
be broadcast in the original director's cut and in black and white, NBC said, 
and will not be presented on any other broadcast service. 
</P>
<P>
 Littlefield also disclosed that the Friday night drama series "Against the 
Grain," about a high school football coach and his family, had been canceled 
because of low ratings. In development as possible series for next season are 
projects starring Ralph Macchio, Shawn and Marlon Wayans, Patty Duke, Melissa 
Gilbert and Cicely Tyson.

TEEN GETS 10 YEARS IN O.C. 'GAY BASHING' CASE; COURTS: HIS CO-DEFENDANT 
RECEIVES ONE-YEAR JAIL TERM. JUDGE SAYS NEAR-FATAL ASSAULT WAS 'CLEARLY A HATE 
CRIME.' 
</P>

<P>
 Ending a hate crime case that outraged Orange County's gay community, a judge 
Friday ordered a San Juan Capistrano man to serve 10 years in prison and 
sentenced his co-defendant to a year in jail for a near-fatal assault on a 
Costa Mesa man they believed was homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey denounced the assault as 
"savagery" and refused requests for lenient sentences for Jeffrey Michael 
Raines, 19, and San Clemente resident Christopher Michael Cribbins, 23. Lawyers 
for the pair had tried to portray the Jan. 9, 1993, attack on Loc Minh Truong, 
56, as the act of immature boys whose attempt at macho behavior went awry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is clearly a hate crime," Dickey said before a courtroom crowded with 
nearly 60 people, more than half of whom were Raines' relatives and friends. 
"This crime was planned ahead of time, and it involved excessive violence and 
viciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 Truong was found unconscious on a desolate stretch of Laguna Beach, his left 
eye severely damaged and protruding from its socket, and a rock lodged 
three-quarters of an inch into the back of his head. Truong can no longer walk 
without assistance and expects to spend several years in therapy to regain the 
ability to perform the simplest tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 The beating, which occurred in a small enclave that has traditionally served 
as a safe haven for Orange County gays and lesbians, sparked an outcry from 
gay-rights advocates, local politicians, police and others. 
</P>
<P>
 It also served to underscore the fear that many Orange County gays and 
lesbians say they endure as a result of their sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Truong, who did not attend Friday's sentencing, has said he is not gay. He has 
filed a lawsuit against Raines and Cribbins, asking for unspecified damages for 
lost wages and the cost of his hospital stay. 
</P>
<P>
 During a two-hour sentencing hearing, Raines hung his head as he apologized 
for his crimes. Earlier, Raines' priest and two family friends testified on his 
behalf, describing him as a polite, church-going youth who never showed signs 
of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really, truly sorry for everything that happened," said Raines, who 
spoke in a low voice and appeared near tears. "I can't do anything to overcome 
what happened. I can only express my guilt and remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a man. I have to accept responsibility. I ask all of you to forgive me 
and have mercy on me," Raines said, adding that he was raised in the Catholic 
faith to love all those around him and vowed to follow those teachings again. 
"That's how I'm going to be the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Raines blinked his eyes and braced himself, as if for a blow, when Dickey 
sentenced him. After being led away to a holding cell near the courtroom, 
Raines could be heard crying loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach City Councilman Robert F. Gentry, who is gay, said in a telephone 
interview that the sentences handed down Friday were appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pleased that the severity of the sentence matches the severity of the 
act and does indeed send a message that people cannot attempt to kill people 
just because of who they are. And so I applaud the judge's decision," Gentry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two women who described themselves as "proud lesbians" from Anaheim attended 
the hearing and said they were "satisfied" with the sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Raines, Cribbins and several other young men were drinking and hanging out 
that night nearly one year ago when Raines suggested the group "beat some fag 
up," according to court records. While the other men eventually backed away 
from joining the attack, Raines and Cribbins went after Truong, the records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Raines, who nearly beat Truong to death, pleaded guilty in August to attempted 
murder, assault and an allegation that the attack was a so-called "hate crime." 
Cribbins, who started the attack by pushing Truong but then ran away, also 
pleaded guilty to assault and committing a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Denise Gragg, who represented Cribbins, said her client 
was also deeply remorseful for his crimes. Gragg asked the judge to fan "the 
ember of humanity" glowing in Cribbins by sparing him a stretch in jail, where 
he will be influenced by other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dickey gave Cribbins a yearlong jail sentence and placed him on five 
years' probation -- an unusually long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Gragg and Raines' defense attorney, Frederick McBride, told Dickey that 
the defendants were immature boys who had false impressions of how a man must 
prove himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another example of male adolescent violent posturing," said McBride, who 
described his husky client as "a boy in a man's body." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig McKinnon disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It boils down to a simple case of hatred," McKinnon said. Raines "had a dark 
evil side, a hatred, a hatred of homosexuals that boiled over and exploded like 
a volcano." 
</P>
<P>
 Raines' parents refused to comment after the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 One teen-ager who said he attends church with Raines said Raines did not 
deserve a harsh sentence because he is "a very kind and caring person. He is a 
real humane person who didn't hate homosexuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Gay rights activists, who had feared the defendants' guilty pleas would result 
in lenient terms, praised the sentences handed down by Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
 Such concerns had prompted Laguna Hills attorney Eric P. Lampel, who has no 
direct involvement in the case, to organize a campaign that ultimately produced 
more than 3,000 letters to Dickey demanding maximum sentences for the two 
defendants. Letters came from as far away as New York, and a letter from the 
Laguna Beach City Council was included. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dickey responded by asking prosecutors to consider charging Lampel with 
the misdemeanor crime of improperly seeking to sway the judge's decision. 
Prosecutors said Friday they have not completed their inquiry into that matter. 
Lampel, who did not attend the hearing, said in a telephone interview that he 
believes the sentence sends the appropriate message. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to know that this kind of behavior is not acceptable in Orange 
County," he said.

O.C. TO GET BACK FUNDS, CONTROL UNDER PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON and MARK LANDSBAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in three years, the release of the state budget proposal 
did not produce an immediate cry of fiscal distress from Orange County leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, an unusual atmosphere of encouragement greeted the release Friday of 
Gov. Pete Wilson's plan to give local governments more authority and money to 
manage critical services. 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of this optimism is a budget plan that would actually transfer 
$1.1 billion in local property taxes back to the counties, a stark reversal in 
policy and fortunes from previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 The state would also pick up a larger share of funding for trial courts, about 
$387 million more statewide, under Wilson's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the promise of more financial support, the governor is asking 
local governments to take on more responsibility in managing an array of social 
service programs, from welfare to child foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the fact that the state is not proposing a tax shift from the counties 
is a major victory," County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said Friday 
after returning from a late-night briefing at the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't predict what the Legislature is going to do, but the governor is out 
of the gate with us. The practice of balancing the budget on the backs of the 
counties can't go on. There just isn't any (money) left." 
</P>
<P>
 Praise for the governor's plan was more mixed among local educators and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson has promised to give public schools enough money to keep pace 
with enrollments, a proposal to increase student fees at community colleges and 
state universities was not winning many plaudits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fees have more than doubled since I started back to college as a 
returning student two years ago," said Jan Clutter, a 51-year-old single mother 
and Orange Coast College student. 
</P>
<P>
 "The increase in the fees twice in the last two years has made financial aid 
even more crucial. If (Wilson is) intent on increasing the fees, he's got to 
find some way to increase grants, scholarships and financial aid." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Jerry Keating, spokesman for Cal State Fullerton: "About all we can say 
at the moment is the budget clearly portends another lean year for the 
university and yet another round of student fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, given the slowness of the recovery of California's economy, we are 
thankful for what the governor has proposed." 
</P>
<P>
 But local government leaders were expressing the most relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairman Harriett M. Wieder noted that 
Wilson's promises for counties and cities fall in an election year when the 
governor will be looking for support from all quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the timing is great," Wieder said. "People don't like the status quo. 
People don't like the way government runs right now. I'm glad the governor is 
moving to give us more responsibility for program management, but they have to 
give us the money too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson plan is based on a general restructuring of how basic services are 
delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 For counties, the state is proposing that local governments assume more 
management and operational responsibility for indigent health care, mental 
health services, alcohol and drug programs, in-home support services and child 
foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 A key to that offer, however, is the governor's promise to provide $2.8 
billion to counties to fund those new responsibilities. About $350 million of 
that total would pay for local job retraining programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $741 million would be distributed to local governments to pay for 
costs associated with the remaining social service programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Friday that it was too early to know how much of the funding 
would flow directly to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, it looks like we're not going to have to bail out the 
state," Schneider said. "All in all, the news is pretty favorable." 
</P>
<P>
 But the scenario painted by Wilson's budget depends on the state receiving 
federal grants to fund those social services and a Legislature sympathetic to 
years of budget hardship in counties and cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, members of the Orange County state legislative delegation quickly 
pledged their support for Wilson's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunity is there and the challenge is on the Legislature to make this 
a reality," state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) told supervisors at a 
briefing Friday. "It is a bold plan that has tremendous merit in giving more 
authority to local governments. It's probably the most dramatic change in 
government structure since I've been in the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson said the increased authority should give counties added incentive to 
see that the programs run efficiently and within the budgets allocated for 
their administration and operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson acknowledged, however, that much of the proposal hinges on the 
federal government's decision to keep millions of dollars flowing to California 
to fund needed programs and to compensate for the influx of new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, California received just $324 million of the $1.45 billion Wilson 
requested from the federal government for the cost of educating the 400,000 
illegal immigrants he says are in the public schools, providing emergency 
medical care to the undocumented population and imprisoning illegal immigrants 
convicted of felonies here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have a close relationship with the federal government," Bergeson 
said. "This is one of the few budgets I can get excited about. The opportunity 
is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) said he would also work to ensure 
that counties get the authority and money promised by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of opportunity is in giving you more flexibility in administering these 
programs," Pringle told supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 On local college and university campuses, however, endorsements for the budget 
plan were harder to find. 
</P>
<P>
 While the governor has promised to pump millions of dollars more into the 
state's community colleges and two university systems, much of that cost is 
expected to be passed onto students in the form of increased fees. 
</P>
<P>
 For the University of California system, the governor's budget promises a 3.2% 
increase, the first state funding increase for the system in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 But later this month, the UC Board of Regents is expected to consider a 
proposed $620 general student fee increase per year. At the California State 
University system, student fees next year are expected to go up by about $300 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 3.2% increase represents the best possible outcome given the state's 
fiscal situation," said L. Dennis Smith, UC Irvine's executive vice chancellor. 
"I don't know that the governor could have done any better for us at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of other demands for state funds," he said. "I think this is a 
ray of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the proposed student fee increase, Smith said students would be paying 
"about one-third of the cost of their education, with the state paying over 6% 
of the cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Community college students are also certain to help finance a 3.4% increase in 
funding from the state, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Community College District Chancellor William Vega said he was concerned 
that the state has placed too much emphasis on building prisons, at the expense 
of education. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't educate our Californians so they are capable of leading 
productive lives, we will only increase the number of homeless and criminals," 
Vega said.

 DISARMING IDEA: The trouble with those "tickets (or toys) for guns" programs 
that have erupted everywhere is that they get the wrong guns, figures L.A. 
Councilman Joel Wachs. So instead of the carrot, Wachs proposes using the stick 
-- a $600 reward for reporting possessors of illegal guns (B4). . . . Those 
tickets and toys "go to a lot of people who may have a gun in the closet for 10 
years," he said. "That's not the kind of gun that is likely to be used in a 
crime."

<P>
 HIKE TO SPAGO: MCA's attempts to get a Metro Rail stop put next to its 
CityWalk in Universal City appear doomed. County transportation experts 
conclude that would delay already advanced plans for a stop nearby by 21 months 
and boost costs by as much as $41 million -- more than the strained budget 
could tolerate (B1). . . . Final say goes to the MTA.

 ICY FEAR: A Canoga Park skater, who was on the ice in a nearby arena when 
defending women's champion Nancy Kerrigan was attacked at the U.S. Figure 
Skating championships in Detroit, says she won't be looking over her shoulder 
during the finals today -- although nobody would blame her (C10). . . . . "I'm 
not really worried," said Natasha Kuchiki, 17 (above). "Some people are a 
little crazy in the head." 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD EATS: Best restaurants in the Valley will always be a matter of dispute 
and (ahem) taste, but the 5,200 volunteer Zagat critics name two local spots in 
the list of Southern California's 20 most popular: Saddle Peak Lodge in 
Calabasas made 16th and the Cheesecake Factory in Woodland Hills 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 DECEPTIVE GRACE: He makes it look simple, but very little has been easy for 
Brooklyn McLinn, CSUN's basketball team leader and hot scorer (C10). . . . In 
CSUN's last eight games, the fifth-year senior averaged 15.5 points, connecting 
on 24 of 46 shots from three-point range. T. W. McGarry

WILSON PLAN EMBRACES SOME PROJECTS IN VALLEY; BUDGET: THE LARGEST SHARE OF 
LOCAL FUNDS -- $25 MILLION -- IS PROPOSED FOR CSUN TO UPGRADE SEWER, UTILITIES 
AND COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even with austerity replacing pork-barrel politics in hard times, Gov. Pete 
Wilson's proposed budget includes a number of modest goodies for the San 
Fernando Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest chunk of cash slated for capital improvements in the Valley is 
headed for Cal State Northridge -- that is, if lawmakers agree to Wilson's 
1994-95 budget when it's thrashed out in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus will get $25 million for the unglamorous purpose of upgrading its 
sewer, central plant, utilities and communications facilities and to remove 
asbestos from the engineering building. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mission College, Wilson has proposed $2.3 million to equip the school's 
new learning resource center -- a library project that has been under 
development for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 And Antelope Valley Community College stands to gain $2.8 million that Wilson 
earmarked for road construction so the northern part of the school can be 
connected to the rest of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 At Glendale College, Wilson proposed spending $615,000 for a 3,000-square-foot 
addition to the fine arts lab, while College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita 
stands to gain nearly $4.5 million for its fine arts library, new labs and 
classrooms. The bulk of that money -- $3.4 million -- is pegged for 
construction of a fire break and access road around the perimeter of the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, whose activities are financed mostly 
through voter-approved bond funds, received a slight boost in funding in the 
governor's budget -- just enough to cover a 5% raise for state employees, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's budget gives the conservancy $629,999, a bit more than the $610,000 
it received from the state's 1993-94 budget. But the key source of funding for 
the conservancy to buy up parklands is a bond measure that allocates $10 
million annually through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the smaller Valley allocations in Wilson's spending plan -- but 
apparently among the most welcome -- is $256,000 earmarked for a new emergency 
communications center at the San Fernando Police Department facility. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said the Police Department's network of amateur radio operators 
have been holding their weekly emergency communications drills in the basement 
of the dilapidated former police station. Now, if the Legislature approves 
Wilson's budget, the volunteers will move to an addition to be built onto the 
department's station house.

GILL NET FOES SEE RULING AS VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years after voters approved an initiative outlawing gill nets in 
California waters, commercial fishermen have been ordered to pull their nets 
from the sea, the measure's boosters announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), author of the 1990 ballot measure, said 
a San Diego County Superior Court judge rejected pleas this week by fishermen 
for a temporary reprieve from the ban, which took effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen and other backers of Proposition 132, which sought to protect sea lions 
and other marine mammals that become snagged in the nets, predicted they would 
win when a legal challenge by gill net fishermen goes to trial April 1 in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nets are out of the water, and for that we are very, very happy," Allen 
declared during a Capitol press conference. "This is a great day for marine 
mammals." 
</P>
<P>
 But fishing industry officials said the fight is far from over, confidently 
predicting that the ruling Thursday by Judge Arthur W. Jones does not presage 
the outcome of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see what he said yesterday as having much bearing on what he'll 
decide in two months," said Peter H. Flournoy, attorney for the gill net 
fishermen. "We'll ultimately prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 The fishermen contend the proposition's boosters have consistently overstated 
the effect of gill nets on dolphins, sea lions and whales in an effort to 
camouflage their true aim: to clear the ocean of the commercial fleet so sports 
anglers have a free run of the seas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially what the sports fishermen want is their own playground in 
Southern California without commercial competition," said Diane Plescher, 
manager of the California Seafood Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, she said, consumers will be hurt by the ban, which will 
eliminate 4 million pounds of fish annually -- 30% of the local catch that goes 
to market. The ban will virtually eliminate locally caught California halibut, 
white sea bass, near-shore shark, barracuda, yellowtail and white croaker. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the demands, fish will be shipped from Mexico, where gill nets are 
still used, Plescher said. "The irony of this whole thing is it's putting our 
small independent fisherman out of business, yet the public will continue to 
demand white tablecloth species like halibut and white bass." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after voters approved the proposition, state officials counted about 
500 gill net fishermen in California. Today, the number stands at about 100 -- 
and now those fishermen are being forced out of California waters while they 
await outcome of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 While commercial fishermen contend marine mammal populations in California 
waters are healthy and expanding in size, the proposition's boosters argue that 
many species are only now beginning to re-establish themselves after severe 
declines. During 1986-87, state Fish and Game officials counted more than 6,000 
sea lions and harbor seals caught in nets. 
</P>
<P>
 They also argue that the gill nets were stripping shallow coastal waters of 
many types of fish that eventually would have disappeared had not the 
proposition intervened. Of the fish snagged in the nets, 70% have no commercial 
or economic value because of their size or type, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen our ocean decline from one of the world's premier fishing grounds 
to what it is now -- a desert," said Michael Von Quilich of the San Diego Rod & 
Reel club.

OIL SPILL ON PUERTO RICO BEACH IMPERILS TOURIST INDUSTRY; ENVIRONMENT: ABOUT 
750,000 GALLONS SPEW OUT WHEN A BARGE RUNS INTO A REEF AND TANKS RUPTURE. 
CONTAINMENT EQUIPMENT IS EN ROUTE TO ISLAND. 
</P>

<P>
 About 750,000 gallons of heating oil spilled into the sea after a barge ran 
into a reef just offshore Friday, blackening about a mile of golden beaches and 
theatening to disrupt the island's tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't believe it. I walked down here just ready to lay in the sun. 
This is terrible," said Betty Sue Cooper of Dallas, looking woefully upon the 
Caribe Hilton beach, where the sand was coated with slimy black oil. The water 
glimmered black. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morris J. Burman barge, carrying more than 1.5 million gallons of oil, was 
being pulled past San Juan to Antigua by a tugboat before dawn Friday when a 
line snapped and the barge crashed into the reef. Some of its nine tanks 
ruptured, sending heavy black oil gushing into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pedro Rossello called the spill "a catastrophe" and said he hopes a quick 
cleanup could soften the blow to the island's tourism industry. The spill 
apparently did not affect Atlantic and Caribbean resorts outside San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
 At an evening news conference, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said 
that the barge had spillled about 750,000 gallons into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency workers laid floating barriers to limit the damage to a mile-long 
strip of the Atlantic coast, while helicopters roared overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 High waves pounded the barge, wedged in shallow water in a reef 300 yards 
offshore, raising fears it could break up. Oil spill specialists and heavy 
equipment were en route. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coast Guard Cmdr. Robert Ross, coordinator for oil spill response in San 
Juan, said a barge with a pump was being brought in to remove the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner and Coast Guard 
Commandant J. William Kime flew in to inspect the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The barge is continuing to lose cargo into the water," Ross said, adding that 
it was "entirely likely that more damage could occur to the barge." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sides and the main deck were intact, Ross said the damage to the 
bottom and the internal bulkheads was not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels near palm-lined Escambron beach sent their visitors by bus to other 
resorts on the island for the day and shifted guests to higher floors to escape 
the nauseating fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said she had just arrived Thursday night but said she might go to the 
Bahamas instead. Others decided to go elsewhere in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you stay on the beach if you can't go to the beach?" said Joel 
Klarreich of New York, who was ending a week's vacation Friday with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad we're leaving," Lynn Klarreich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Receding tides widened the ribbon of blackened sand, and some oil oozed into 
the Condado Lagoon, normally a haven for kayaks and sailboats. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Cmdr. Edwin Stanton, coordinator of port operations for San Juan's marine 
safety office, said the fumes pervading the capital of this U.S. commonwealth 
presented a health hazard to people with lung problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The crippled vessel held less than one-sixth the amount that spilled in 1989 
from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound. There was no early 
estimate of the cost of cleanup efforts, and Ross refused to speculate on the 
cause of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fish, wildlife, marine life is going to be affected. They're going to die," 
said Jose Burgos, duty officer for Puerto Rico's civil defense agency.  
</P>
<P>
 The barge was built in 1976, the Coast Guard said. Preusch said the cargo, No. 
6 heavy oil, is commonly used for heating.

 The Raiders' playoff game against the Broncos on Sunday was a little less than 
7,000 tickets shy of a sellout late Friday, according to Raider executive 
assistant Al LoCasale. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL had granted the Raiders a two-day extension to sell out the 
67,800-seat Coliseum, but if the stadium is not sold out by 1 p.m. today, the 
game will be blacked out in Los Angeles.

PEELER HELPS LAKERS RALLY TO BEAT THE CLIPPERS, 111-108; PRO BASKETBALL: HE HAS 
26 POINTS AND A CAREER-HIGH NINE REBOUNDS AS AN 11-POINT DEFICIT IS OVERCOME. 
</P>

 No matter what bad things have happened to the Lakers already and what bad 
things will happen the rest of the way, no matter the problems scoring and 
rebounding, no matter the losing streaks, they will always have something 
positive from 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 They will always have the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "And no matter what," Laker Sedale Threatt said, "you want to be the best team 
in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers guaranteed that much Friday night, when Anthony Peeler had 26 
points, a career-high nine rebounds and a couple of big plays down the stretch, 
and Vlade Divac added 15 points and 16 rebounds in a 111-108 victory over the 
Clippers at the Forum to clinch the season series after only three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the Clippers was motivation enough, but more was forthcoming. Coach 
Randy Pfund getting ejected with 8:49 left in the third quarter inspired his 
players. Clipper Mark Jackson going into his signature jiggle only increased 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a lot of confidence against us," Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said. "We 
played a great basketball game at times, but at the end, they smelled blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning for only the second time in 20 games when trailing entering the fourth 
quarter, the Lakers rallied from an 11-point deficit in the third period to 
take the lead when Peeler intercepted Jackson's careless pass and went in alone 
for a slam dunk with 3:57 remaining. When the Clippers went back ahead, it was 
Peeler again who made the big play, making a three-pointer from the right side 
over a charging Danny Manning with 25 seconds left for a 108-106 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him coming at me," Peeler said of Manning. "But I also could hear 
Sedale (Threatt) yelling, 'Shoot it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So he did. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers brought the ball upcourt, then called a timeout with nine seconds 
remaining. Their shot at a tie was Manning's 13-footer from the baseline, which 
fell short off the rim. Doug Christie got the rebound, was fouled immediately 
and made both free throws for a 110-106 lead with three seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
 A layin by Manning with 1.9 seconds remaining closed the gap to 110-108, 
before one free throw by Elden Campbell gave the Lakers their final margin of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to avoid a season-long four-game losing streak, the Clippers used a 
14-0 run to take a 48-38 lead late in the second quarter. When Mark Aguirre 
finished the half with two more baskets for the Clippers, including a 
three-point play with the help of a free throw, the the Clipper lead was 53-42. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre was a big factor, scoring 14 points off the bench to complement Ron 
Harper's 15. But so was the Clippers' committing only five turnovers, after 
having 17 in the same stretch the game before against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Lakers, who began the night committing the second-fewest 
turnovers in the league at 14.5 per game, had 12 in the first half. The 
Clippers converted that into 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 59-49 when Pfund was ejected for the second time as Laker coach, 
courtesy of two technicals from Ted Bernhardt in rapid-fire succession. The 
first was for arguing a non-call when Manning blocked Nick Van Exel's drive, 
and the second came when Pfund went to midcourt to briefly go face to face with 
Bernhardt before heading to the locker room. Laker-Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers on Friday signed guard Harold Ellis, replacing Henry James, who 
was waived the day before. Ellis, who watched the game in street clothes from 
the bench and is expected to be in uniform tonight against the Miami Heat at 
the Sports Arena, was the Clippers' final cut of training camp. He then joined 
the Quad City Thunder of the CBA and averaged 21.4 points and a league-leading 
2.9 steals before being brought back. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the Lakers were vindicated in keeping James Edwards as a 
third-string center while cutting Kurt Rambis and Trevor Wilson, even if it 
meant ignoring Edwards' wish to be waived or traded to somewhere he could play. 
With Sam Bowie sidelined for at least six weeks after arthroscopic surgery, 
Edwards has become the backup to Vlade Divac. "I don't look at it at that 
standpoint," Laker Coach Randy Pfund said of being vindicated. "But we have 
talked all along about how you've got to be real careful at the center 
position. There's not a lot of guys out there with the experience of James 
Edwards." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper guard Ron Harper said he hopes to visit his doctor, John Bergfeld, in 
Cleveland during the upcoming six-game trip to get a second opinion on his 
sprained left little finger. X-rays have confirmed the sprain, which kept him 
out of practice Thursday. . . . Clipper Mark Jackson played in his 500th game.

SPOT EXPECTED FOR KERRIGAN ON U.S. TEAM; FIGURE SKATING: SHE IS FORCED TO 
WITHDRAW FROM OLYMPIC TRIALS BECAUSE OF INJURY SUFFERED IN ASSAULT, BUT 
PROBABLY WILL GO TO NORWAY ANYWAY IF SHE CAN RECOVER IN TIME.

 While police expanded their search for the man who assaulted Nancy Kerrigan, 
she withdrew Friday from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships because of leg 
injuries suffered in the attack the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though she is not competing in the championships, which serve as the 
trials for next month's Winter Olympics in Norway, U.S. Figure Skating Assn. 
officials said their rules allow them to give her one of two berths reserved 
for U.S. women if she is fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, my focus is just to get healthy and, hopefully, if I'm chosen for 
the Olympics, to get ready for that because I've worked so hard," said the 
24-year-old Kerrigan, the defending champion and 1992 Olympic bronze medalist. 
"I've never worked so hard in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 With the woman who began this week as the overwhelming favorite watching from 
a well secured private box high above the Joe Louis Arena rink, 19 skaters 
performed in the opening phase of the competition, aware that they are probably 
vying for only one Olympic berth. 
</P>
<P>
 After the technical program, which accounts for one-third of the final score, 
a former national champion, Tonya Harding of Portland, Ore., is leading; Nicole 
Bobek of Colorado Springs, Colo., is second; Michelle Kwan of Torrance is 
third, and Elaine Zayak of Monsey, N.Y., is fourth. Zayak, the 1982 world 
champion, is making her return to amateur competition. 
</P>
<P>
 If those skaters, or their coaches, have complaints about the possibility of 
Kerrigan going to Norway without having competed in the national championships, 
they did not voice them to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This happened because of no fault of Nancy's at all," said Frank Carroll, who 
coaches the 13-year-old Kwan at Lake Arrowhead's International Ice Castles 
Training Center. "It's a tragic thing, and it would be more tragic if they 
discarded her if she was capable of going and skating well." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's coach, Evy Scotvold, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy is the top-ranked skater in our country," he said. "If she can heal in 
time for the Olympic Games, we cannot let a vicious criminal assault . . . take 
someone off the Olympic team. If she can go, she has to go. Otherwise, we are 
honoring that attack." 
</P>
<P>
 The 45 members of the USFSA's international committee will meet after 
tonight's freestyle program to rule on Kerrigan. If they follow precedent, she 
and the winner here will join the Olympic team, and the runner-up will be 
designated as an alternate in case Kerrigan cannot prove fitness by Jan. 31. 
That is the deadline for the U.S. Olympic Committee to submit figure skating 
entries for the Feb. 12-27 Winter Games. The women's competition is scheduled 
Feb. 23 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahlon Bradley, an orthopedic surgeon who examined Kerrigan on Friday, said 
she will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging test Monday to determine whether 
there is cartilage damage to her injured right knee, but, if it is negative, he 
predicted that she will be able to return to the ice in her Cape Cod, Mass., 
training rink in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether she could be fit for the Olympics, he said, "We're optimistic 
about that possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The X-rays taken Thursday revealed no fractures, but there was swelling in the 
knee overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision not to skate (Friday) was made by the medical staff based on 
pain, lack of motion and lack of strength in the knee," Bradley said. "She 
would have been unable to do any of her elements." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, who was limping when she arrived for an afternoon news conference, 
said she tried to convince her doctors that she could skate Friday but was 
unable to perform even simple strength tests they devised for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the attack, which occurred while she was walking toward a dressing room 
after finishing an afternoon practice at Cobo Arena, Kerrigan said she turned 
when she heard a commotion and saw a man charging toward her. But she said she 
did not get a good look at him before he took "one good whack" at her knee with 
"a long black stick." 
</P>
<P>
 The man broke a locked plexiglass door to escape and was still at large Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very optimistic, personally, that we'll catch him," said Detroit's deputy 
chief of police, Benny Napoleon. But he acknowledged that there were no 
suspects and that only one eyewitness had seen the man face to face. 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon said that videotapes of the practice session taken by spectators were 
being reviewed in the hope that police could spot a man who fit the description 
they have. He added that they are exploring leads in Oregon, Texas and Ontario, 
Canada, as well as Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan said that she is "paranoid" about the chance of another attack but 
acknowledged that she will not be able to avoid the spotlight as long as she is 
among the world's leading figure skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be kind of hard for me to be less of a public person," she said. 
"Since this happened, I've been on the news every half hour. So if people 
didn't know me before, they do now." 
</P>
<P>
 One newscast showed a videotape of her writhing on the floor after the attack 
and asking, "Why me?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Why anybody?" Kerrigan said Friday. "That's what I should have been asking."

UNABLE TO GENERATE MUCH IN THE WAY OF STABILITY, FAN SUPPORT OR EVEN OFFENSE, 
THE NFC CENTRAL CHAMPIONS HAVE MANY WONDERING . . .; WHAT DRIVES DETROIT?

<P>
 They are champions of football's most enduring and revered division, the NFC 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
 It is two days before their first-round playoff game against a longtime rival. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension in the Detroit Lion locker room is palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I find out who did this, they are going to pay!" tackle Lomas Brown 
shouts. 
</P>
<P>
 A prankster has tied Brown's helmet and jersey to his locker. He is furiously 
trying to get them unknotted before practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't just happen during the playoffs," he sighs. "This is all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 In another part of the room, the defensive linemen are preparing for their 
weekly game of "Pile-on." 
</P>
<P>
 After practice, they will order Lamar Leachman, the defensive line coach, to 
stretch out, face up, on the turf. The five or six of them will pile on him 
until he screams for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 Leachman is 59 and has bad knees. He will definitely scream for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to kill him, of course," lineman Marc Spindler says. "If we 
kill him, then we have to get up and run." 
</P>
<P>
 On a wall near Spindler is a picture of a grossly overweight man. Over his 
head, somebody has stuck a mug shot of guard Dave Richards. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming out of Richards' mouth are the words, "Just eat, baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Under that picture is a list of what players supposedly wanted for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 One entry reads, "Jason Hanson -- Winnie the Pooh Blanket." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson, the Lion kicker who led the NFC in scoring, shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I don't hit anybody, they kid me about being a girl," he says. "Then, 
during kick-blocking practice, I'll kick one low, get somebody right in the 
face -- accidentally, of course." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You play on this team," Richards says, "you have a thick skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Kramer walks triumphantly into a horde of cameras. He is probably the 
starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been anointed by Coach Wayne Fontes as the permanent starter and has 
held that role for the last four weeks, all of which means nothing on a team 
whose starting quarterbacks have the average life span of a haircut. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Peete was the permanent starter at the beginning of the season. A month 
later, Andre Ware took over, played well in his first game and was made the 
starter for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Three quarters later, he was benched. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to Peete, who started three games, received his vote of confidence, then 
was demoted to third string. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strangest thing about all this is that you don't go from first to second 
string on this team," Peete says. "You go from first to third. Then back to 
first. Then third. Then first. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Or you simply get fired, which is what happened to offensive coordinator Dan 
Henning with a month left in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it has been left to Kramer, once so low he could only have played if 
the other two quarterbacks had been maimed, to lead the Lions today against the 
Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer has been so good in the last month -- eight touchdown passes, two 
interceptions -- that he is no longer receiving phone calls from the team 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Only on the Lions is this a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the year, when the Lions were about to announce that Ware was the 
starter, Kramer found the following message on his answering machine from owner 
William Clay Ford: "Andre, give me a call, I've got good news." 
</P>
<P>
 Only on the Lions. Only here. Only now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange," Richards says. "The other day I was telling my wife that I 
thought we could have won more games -- and yet I can't believe we won 10." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's strange. The Lions have won the Central Division title two of the last 
three seasons, but few seem to understand who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Even fewer understand how they did it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans know they have running back Barry Sanders, but Sanders hasn't played in 
five weeks because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans know they have a distinctive looking coach, but Fontes is most often 
compared to Fred Flintstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans know they play football on Thanksgiving, but this season they had only 
two more points than turnovers in an embarrassing loss to the Chicago Bears, 
10-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two championships in three years, baby," Fontes said. "When people ask about 
us, I just say, 'Two out of three.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But how? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the fans. This is the only team in the NFL with more starting 
quarterbacks than season-ticket holders. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely because of their 80,368-seat stadium -- the league's largest -- only 
two home games have not been blacked out locally. Even today's playoff game did 
not sell out. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the offense. The Lions ranked 24th in total offense, and only three 
teams in the NFL have given up more sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be their schedule, which was stacked with poor teams after their 
last-place finish in 1992? 
</P>
<P>
 Of their 10 victories, only two were over playoff teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The best team they played, the San Francisco 49ers, beat them, 55-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody said we weren't the best team in the division, but the bottom line 
is, we won the thing," linebacker Chris Spielman said. "Last I looked, nothing 
else matters but wins and losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Except nothing with this team is as simple and straightforward as a bottom 
line. The Lions do not have one personality trait, but several: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They have Fontes' unorthodox coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 After the loss to the 49ers, he stunned the players by announcing that they 
would not have to watch the game films. He even gave them an extra day off. 
</P>
<P>
 "And even if we have to play the 49ers in the playoffs, we ain't watching that 
film. It's terrible," Fontes said. "The 49ers played a bunch of other games. 
We'll watch them." 
</P>
<P>
 His stability helped him guide the team through recent tragedies -- the death 
of lineman Eric Andolsek and the paralyzing injury suffered by lineman Mike 
Utley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fontes' emotional reactions at other times led to what the players call 
"musical quarterbacks" and the firing of Henning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know some people look at what's happened here this year and think we're in 
total disarray," Fontes says. "I do a lot of things that aren't done in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I ask you, look at what has happened after every move. Look where we are 
now. My moves might not be normal, but they work." 
</P>
<P>
 -- They have Spielman's ability to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 The scruffy Spielman is famous, not merely for being one of the league's best 
inside linebackers, but for wearing other's clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day, everything he wore was borrowed, from a faded T-shirt to an 
old hunting jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once threw an old pair of San Diego Chargers sweat pants in the garbage, 
holes in the knee, crotch missing," Richards said. "Next day I come in, 
Spielman's wearing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like the Lion offense, which replaced the irreplaceable Sanders with 
castoffs Derrick Moore and Eric Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 With Moore the starter in three games and Lynch in two, they have combined for 
139.6 total yards per game. Sanders averaged 120 yards in the Lions' first 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the two young players have avoided locker room grief. When reporters 
surround Lynch, other players chant, "Lynch mob! Lynch mob!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- They have Kramer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kramer is told that it is a miracle he is starting, he solemnly shakes 
his head. He has his own idea about miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, he skipped two weeks of training camp, ruining his chances of 
moving higher than third string, because he was back home in Southern 
California, caring for his seriously ill infant son. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffen Kramer is fine now and is always there in mother Marshawn's arms when 
Erik looks up in the stands during games. 
</P>
<P>
 But for several weeks after his birth on June 24, Griffen battled a serious 
staph infection that caused him to be temporarily bloated, misshapen and close 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer's eyes still tear when he talks about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate a lot of things now that used to slip by me," he said. "I have 
become more focused. I see things differently." 
</P>
<P>
 As do his teammates, both in crazy ways and in ways that have helped them 
endure. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that is their secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "You play on this team long enough, you develop a scar," Spielman said. 
"Nothing gets through that scar."

OH, BROTHER; YOU CAN BET THAT BRONCO TIGHT END SHANNON SHARPE WISHES HE HADN'T 
MADE THIS WAGER WITH STERLING, WHO LED THE NFL IN RECEPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a rivalry born soon after they were. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it was simple competition for brothers Sterling and Shannon Sharpe. Who 
could mow the lawn the fastest? Who could take the trash out the quickest? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the stakes got higher. Who could catch more footballs? In high school. 
In college. In the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, the stakes rose to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the bet between Sterling, the 28-year-old wide receiver of the Green 
Bay Packers, and Shannon, the 25-year-old tight end of the Denver Broncos, to 
be won by the brother who caught the most balls in the 1993 regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt early on in the year that I would have an opportunity to beat him," 
Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling, coming off a season in which he caught an NFL-record 108 passes, 
surpassed that with 112. Whenever the Packers needed yardage, they had Brett 
Favre throw to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon, after catching a career-high 53 passes last season, increased that to 
81 this season, third best in the AFC and the most by a Bronco in 28 years. 
Lionel Taylor caught 85 in 1965, the days of the wide-open American Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 But long before Shannon finished the regular season in spectacular fashion, 
catching six passes for 115 yards and two touchdowns last week against the 
Raiders, he had settled up with his brother, paying him $5,000 about seven 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably would have kept the bet on, but the thing was, it was just getting 
more publicity than either one of our accomplishments was," Shannon said. "I 
think it was starting to become a distraction because when people wanted to 
talk to us, they wanted to talk about -- actually just talk to me because he 
doesn't really talk to the media -- they wanted to talk about the wager." 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling's silence with reporters is mute evidence of the different course the 
brothers have taken to reach the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing three sports at Georgia's Glennville High, Sterling went on to 
South Carolina, where he caught 74 passes for 10 touchdowns in one season and 
wound up as the Packers' first-round draft choice in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon's route was much lower in profile. He, too, attended Glennville High, 
but then, because of academic requirements, wound up at small Savannah State 
College in Georgia. He was drafted by the Broncos in 1990 in the seventh round. 
</P>
<P>
 The expectations for Shannon were far different than for Sterling. So was the 
pressure. And therein lies the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a first-rounder and, in his first year, he didn't put up all-world 
numbers," said Shannon of Sterling, who still caught 55 passes for 791 yards 
his first year, a great season for some. "They questioned whether he had 
breakaway speed. They questioned his toughness. They questioned a lot of other 
things about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next year, he comes back and leads the league in receiving and, all of a 
sudden, he's the greatest thing since sliced bread. Everybody wants to talk to 
him. . . . Well, hey, he's not so soon to forget after you said all those bad 
things about him. . . . I don't think he'll ever really forgive them for what 
they said about him. I don't think he'll ever talk to the Green Bay media." 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon is readily accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really had a problem with the media in Denver, with the exception of 
this year (when) they said some things I didn't really like," he said. "They 
never really said anything derogatory, but I guess they couldn't. I mean, I was 
a seventh-rounder. If I came in and I was a flop, so what? 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in and gradually worked my way up to be one of the better tight ends 
in the league, so they can only say good things about me." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's plenty to say. At 6 feet 2 and 230 pounds, Sharpe has the size to 
play tight end, but he also has enough speed to roam downfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Raider safety Eddie Anderson, who tried to catch Sharpe last week 
when quarterback John Elway hooked up with his favorite target on a 54-yard 
touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
 In that game, Sharpe also caught a one-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sunday, the Raiders will get to see him again in their wild-card playoff 
game at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the first game of the season, Sharpe wrote, "Time has come" on the 
shirt he wears under his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed it has. He might not be the best pass catcher in his own family, 
but he has become Denver's clutch receiver and one of the best in the AFC and, 
barring injury, figures to stay at that level for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's a pretty safe bet.

TEACHER FACES EX-PUPIL; PRO FOOTBALL: CHIEFS AND SCHOTTENHEIMER ARE MATCHED 
AGAINST STEELERS AND COWHER, A FORMER CHIEF ASSISTANT, IN WILD-CARD GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Driving home after last Sunday's game, Coach Marty Schottenheimer of the 
Kansas City Chiefs pondered the possibility of the Chiefs playing the 
Pittsburgh Steelers in a wild-card playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 Schottenheimer reasoned that it would be an uncomfortable situation, given 
that he had groomed Steeler Coach Bill Cowher. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowher played linebacker for three seasons under Schottenheimer in Cleveland, 
and was an assistant coach under him for seven seasons at Cleveland and Kansas 
City before taking the Pittsburgh job in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were driving home and I told my wife (Pat), 'On the one hand, I wanted to 
see Billy get in (the playoffs),' " Schottenheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But on the other hand, I don't really want to play against him because of our 
relationship. Then I figured, 'Nah, let him get in and then let us go do 
battle.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Schottenheimer gets the matchup he both wanted and didn't want when the 
Steelers (9-7) meet the Chiefs (11-5) today at Arrowhead Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Will it be emotional for Cowher? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm past all that," he said. "It's good to go back to Kansas City and see 
some old friends. We'll take care of business and then get out of town." 
</P>
<P>
 Schottenheimer stressed defense and forcing turnovers for years, and it didn't 
fall on deaf ears with Cowher, whose Pittsburgh defense has made it an art 
form. So it should come as no surprise if the Chiefs and the Steelers score 
lower than the sub-20-degree temperature expected at kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the Chiefs have Joe Montana, the quarterback with enough Super Bowl 
rings to make a set of brass knuckles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Kansas City tailback Marcus Allen led the AFC with 15 touchdowns, 
including 12 by rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 But consider that Pittsburgh has the AFC's top-ranked defense, holding 
opponents to 283.2 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers have forced 11 more turnovers than they have given up, tying them 
for third in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 They feature two of the league's best linebackers in Pro Bowl selection Greg 
Lloyd, who has 111 tackles and six sacks, and Kevin Greene, the former Ram whom 
the Steelers signed as an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene is fifth in the conference with 12 1/2 sacks but has been slowed by a 
bruised knee. Cornerback Rod Woodson, the league's defensive player of the year 
with 95 tackles and eight interceptions, will play despite a strained 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have people like Lloyd and Woodson, you're going to match up against 
anybody you play," Schottenheimer said. "They have excellent speed and 
quickness." 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City's defense, which surrenders 298.2 yards a game, fourth-best in the 
AFC, is led by defensive end Neil Smith, who leads the league with 15 sacks. 
Smith is a Pro Bowl selection, as is Derrick Thomas, who has struggled this 
season after moving from outside linebacker to defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be up against a Pittsburgh offense that has scored more than two 
touchdowns in a game only once in its last seven games. Quarterback Neil 
O'Donnell has passed for a career-high 14 touchdowns but has been inconsistent 
at times. The Steelers' leading receiver is a tight end -- Eric Green with 63 
catches for 942 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Steelers will be without their best offensive weapon, tailback Barry 
Foster, who underwent ankle surgery late last month. Leroy Thompson has played 
well in place of Foster, gaining 763 yards in 205 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foster's absence obviously hurts them," Schottenheimer said. "But Thompson is 
an excellent back who has great quickness and speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss of Foster, Pittsburgh has recovered from an 0-2 start, 
including a 27-0 loss to the Rams, to reach the playoffs for the second 
consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Steelers win today, they will play at Buffalo in the next round. A 
Kansas City victory would send the Chiefs to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Schottenheimer is 3-7 in playoff games, and the Steelers are 6-0 against the 
Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium since 1974, including a 27-3 defeat last season, 
one of Schottenheimer's worst losses as the Chiefs' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a loss the Chiefs' fans won't soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
 All week, Kansas City TV stations have replayed footage of the Pittsburgh 
bench celebrating late in the game, with Foster, Woodson and Green laughing, 
joking and mocking the fans' tomahawk chop.

BULLETS' STEWART SHOT, STABBED BY INTRUDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Stewart, a second-year forward for the Washington Bullets, was shot and 
stabbed by four intruders who broke into his Relay, Md., home early Friday and 
tied him up. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart was taken to the Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore. Dr. Roy A.M. Myers, 
who treated Stewart Friday, said he will recover fully from his wounds. He was 
released after treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 A Baltimore County police spokesman said the intruders ransacked the home 
where Stewart was sleeping and fled after shooting the 25-year-old athlete in 
the neck and stabbing him in the thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the intruders specifically targeted Stewart. They could not 
determine Friday morning if anything was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were called to the home at 4:30 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said Stewart was shot in the back of the neck, with the bullet entering 
from the left side of the back of the neck and missing his spinal cord by one 
inch. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet went through the neck, requiring the doctor to simply clean out the 
wound and let it drain. Stewart's neck will be stiff for a while, but he will 
have no permanent disability, Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was extremely lucky neither injury was fatal or permanently damaging," 
Myers said. "I can't imagine anything more terrifying than being assaulted in 
your own home. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment he's doing fine (emotionally), but who knows how he'll be when 
he goes home and relives everything that happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The thigh wound, about one inch deep, required only a few stitches, Myers 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, a 6-foot-8, 230-pound forward, was awaiting surgery on a broken foot. 
He broke his right foot in a summer-league scrimmage in August and has played 
in only three games this season. He was activated early last month, but again 
was placed on the injured list Dec. 27 after re-breaking the foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked, dismayed," Bullet Coach Wes Unseld said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand random acts of violence that go on, and sometimes it's 
surprising that guys like him and guys like me aren't targeted more. It's a big 
relief to everyone here that he is going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Merle Scott, Stewart's agent: "He's fine physically. Emotionally, it's 
going to be some time. Right now we're just getting over the physical part." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Steve Doarnberger of the Baltimore County police said the suspects broke 
in by shattering a sliding door in the back of the house. They then pulled 
Stewart from his bed to the floor, bound his hands and feet and shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 Doarnberger said police believe the men knew where Stewart lived and that it 
was not a random robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't be that specific on a motive," said Doarnberger, adding that there 
was no obvious sign of property being stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullet guard Bent Price said: "It's a scary thing now to be in the public's 
eye. I don't know any other reasons behind this and why they got to Larry, but 
it's an awakening thing for us as players and his teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart left the hospital without commenting on the incident. Doarnberger said 
Stewart could not describe his assailants, but did say that four men were 
involved.

MORNING BRIEFING: HORSE RACING SUFFERS LOSS OF A FIRST LADY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Horse racing lost one of its most loyal $2 bettors when Virginia Kelley, 
President Clinton's mother, died early Thursday. Kelley made her first visit to 
a track in 1941, hit an $84 daily double at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark., 
and became a frequent racegoer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the beautiful animals, I love to see the great athletes ride them and 
I love the wonderful people I meet at the track," Kelley once said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Pat Day's wife, Sheila, designed Kelley's mink-cuffed gown for the 
President's inaugural ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley visited Santa Anita and Del Mar last year and last March she threw out 
the first ball for a jockey-celebrity softball game in Arcadia that raised 
money for the Don MacBeth Memorial Jockey Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Kelley: Asked how much she bet at the races, the President's mother said, 
"Not a lot. I like to come often, and I wouldn't be able to do that if I bet." 
When asked if the President ever bet the races, she said, "He wasn't a gambler. 
When he was a teen-ager, I took him to the track and he lost $4 and never got 
over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the NBA record for highest scoring average in a regular 
season? 
</P>
<P>
 Remember him?Dan Devine and Al Onofrio both had success at Missouri in 
coaching against high-profile football coaches such as Bear Bryant, Bo 
Schembechler, Woody Hayes and John Robinson, but can you believe what Devine 
said after the hiring of Larry Smith as the new Missouri coach?

 "We both agreed that in a big game we would much rather play any of the 
above-mentioned coaches than Larry Smith because of his ability to get 
superhuman efforts from his teams."

 Double victory: California quarterback Dave Barr was asked by San Francisco 
Examiner writer Edvins Beitiks if he had succeeded in getting a date with an 
Iowa cheerleader after the Bears' 37-3 Alamo Bowl victory. Barr's reply: "We 
won the game on and off the field."

 High praise: International basketball observers generally consider Arvidas 
Sabonis of Lithuania the best of the European players, even though he has never 
tried playing in the NBA.

 Charles Barkley played against the 7-foot-4, 300-pound center in Europe and 
told Hoop magazine editor Alex Sachare: "He's really hard to move. I tried to 
knock him out of position with a forearm, and I almost knocked the wind out of 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Claus: The trade of Jim McKenzie from the Hartford Whalers to the Dallas 
Stars came at an opportune time for the Stars' left wing -- shortly before 
Christmas. When McKenzie received a 20-inch color TV with a built-in VCR, plus 
an expensive garment bag, from the Stars, he noted: "This sure beats the 
clock-radios we used to get in Hartford."

 Trivia answer: Wilt Chamberlain, with 50.4 points while playing for the 
Philadelphia Warriors in 1961-62.

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; FOR NOW, THESE AWARDS MUST SUFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until the NFL gets wise and sanctions one set of postseason awards -- the 
Retired Players Who Still Have Bad Haircuts Assn. will be announcing their MVP 
any day now -- we will only report on those awards requiring integrity, heart 
and the ability to do something really silly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ours, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 * PLAYER OF THE YEAR: Emmitt Smith, who wins games when he should be in 
hospitals and loses them by simply not showing up. 
</P>
<P>
 If Smith didn't carry the ball more than once, the Dallas Cowboys didn't win. 
They were 12-1 with his full-time services, 0-3 without. 
</P>
<P>
 * DANCE OF THE YEAR: After intercepting a pass against the San Francisco 
49ers, linebacker Clay Matthews of the Cleveland Browns did an Elvis 
impersonation. 
</P>
<P>
 * END ZONE DANCE OF THE YEAR: Marcus Allen of the Kansas City Chiefs. After 
each of his 15 touchdowns, he did what every player should do. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 * FIGHT OF THE YEAR: David Lang of the Rams vs. Adrian Cooper of the 
Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang wins the award, not because of the punch he landed on Cooper, but because 
he was on the sidelines wearing street clothes when he threw it. 
</P>
<P>
 * COACH OF THE YEAR: Jack Pardee of the Houston Oilers, who accepted calls on 
his radio show all season from fans who screamed at him that he should quit or 
be fired. Neither happened. Thank goodness. 
</P>
<P>
 * COACHING DECISION OF THE YEAR: Dan Reeves of the New York Giants discovered 
that his players had been sneaking out of their team hotel on the night before 
home games, some for as many as 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of increasing security, he canceled everyone's reservations and 
now the players are allowed to sleep in their own beds. This unexpected show of 
rationality by a coach worked for all but . . . well, see next award. 
</P>
<P>
 * NAP OF THE YEAR: Lawrence Taylor of the Giants fell asleep on the bench 
during the second half of a home game against the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 * FREE AGENT OF THE YEAR: Allen, for what was gained by his new team . . . and 
lost by his old one. 
</P>
<P>
 * KICKER OF THE YEAR: Jeff Jaeger of the Raiders defeated the Denver Broncos 
with a last-second field goal in which the ball traveled 53 yards sideways . 
</P>
<P>
 * MISS OF THE YEAR: In a span of three quarters against the New Orleans 
Saints, kicker Roger Ruzek of the Philadelphia Eagles missed three conversion 
kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 No other kicker in the NFC missed as many as three all season. 
</P>
<P>
 * HEAD HUNTERS OF THE YEAR: The Houston Oiler defense knocked the opposing 
starting quarterback out of action nine times in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * UNBELIEVABLE SCORES OF THE YEAR: The Rams defeated the Oilers, 28-13, and 
the Steelers, 27-0. 
</P>
<P>
 * PENALTY OF THE YEAR: On a last-second play in which the New York Jet 
offensive line was told to allow the Cincinnati Bengals a safety, a member of 
that line was called for holding. 
</P>
<P>
 * SHOWCASES OF THE YEAR: The Broncos' 27-21 victory over the Chiefs last 
month. The Patriots' 33-27 overtime victory over the Miami Dolphins last 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game was a duel between NFL legends John Elway and Joe Montana. The 
second was a showcase for the man who should one day replace them, Drew 
Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
 * INJURY OF THE YEAR: Powder from the officials' gunshot at halftime of a 
Dolphin-Chief game landed in the eyes of Dan Saleaumua of the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Saleaumua's eyes were flushed in the trainer's room, and he returned in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 * QUESTION OF THE YEAR: One day after Saleaumua's injury, Carl Peterson, Chief 
general manager, phoned the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this age of advanced technology, tell me, why do we still have referees 
shooting guns?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 * POOR TIMING OF THE YEAR: Harold Green said that Dave Shula was the worst 
coach in Cincinnati Bengal history, then the Bengal runner had perhaps the 
worst season by a full-time running back in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 Green rushed for 589 yards in 215 carries, a 2.7 average. He is the first back 
in league history to carry 200 or more times in a season and not average three 
or more yards. 
</P>
<P>
 * ROOKIE OF THE YEAR: Jerome Bettis of the Rams. If Rick Mirer truly wanted 
this award, he never would have become a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 * LOST ROOKIE OF THE YEAR: Curtis Conway of the Chicago Bears missed a team 
plane to Minneapolis because he could not find this country's busiest airport, 
Chicago's O'Hare Field. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, he later found the end zone often enough to give the Bears a 
couple of victories. 
</P>
<P>
 * AUDIBLE OF THE YEAR: "Peter, Peter, Peter." 
</P>
<P>
 That is what members of the Cowboys' field-goal defense team shouted after 
Pete Stoyanovich's attempt was tipped on Thanksgiving Day in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The call means, "Don't touch the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Lett knows that now. 
</P>
<P>
 * MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE YEAR: Before a punt play in the second half of last 
Sunday's showdown between the Cowboys and the Giants, coaches yelled for the 
Giants' regular defense to get off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The call for that is, "Safe, safe, safe." 
</P>
<P>
 But members of the Giant defense heard, "Stay, stay, stay." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants had to call a timeout and later did not have enough timeouts to go 
for a touchdown from the Dallas 22-yard line in the final seconds of 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 They settled for a tying field goal, then lost the game, NFC East Division 
title and home-field advantage in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 * MEDIA TYPE OF THE YEAR: In his part-time role as a TV commentator, Spencer 
Tillman questioned the loyalty of several Oiler teammates during summer 
contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamar Lathon, one of those players, later attacked Tillman during a scrimmage. 
MILLER TIME 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams fail to land a top quarterback in this spring's draft -- the 
Redskins could take Trent Dilfer, and Heath Shuler might return to Tennessee 
for his senior year -- they will be the leading candidates for the services of 
next spring's marquee free-agent quarterback, Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 No quarterback combines excitement and propensity for injury as does Miller, 
who threw 26 touchdown passes for the Atlanta Falcons in 1991, but has played 
in only 11 games since. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams would be Miller's first choice, and he should be their choice if he 
can prove during a March workout that he has recovered from reconstructive knee 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris wants to go to the West Coast, on grass, in an offense that suits his 
style," said Frank Bauer, Miller's agent. "Ernie Zampese (the Rams' offensive 
coordinator) runs that kind of offense." 
</P>
<P>
 With all other free-agent quarterbacks, there are bigger question marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Chris Chandler recover from a lost season on the Phoenix bench? 
</P>
<P>
 Can Scott Mitchell play outside the Don Shula system? 
</P>
<P>
 The most intriguing longshot would be future free agent Rodney Peete, who is 
obviously unhappy in Detroit and would love to return to the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit insiders worry that he has lost his toughness. A change of scenery has 
a funny way of fixing those things. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really makes me bitter is that they changed the offense, but then didn't 
give me a chance to run it," Peete said of his benching by the Lions, who are 
on a roll under Erik Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer, born and raised in Southern California, will also be a free agent, and 
no quarterback in the league is hotter. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what happens in the postseason, he will have a tough time forgetting 
that the Lions have never shown complete confidence in him. There are a few 
teams that would.

ST. LOUIS IS TRYING TO MAKE ITSELF ATTRACTIVE TO RAMS OR PATRIOTS; FOOTBALL: 
AFTER NFL AWARDS SECOND EXPANSION FRANCHISE TO JACKSONVILLE, MIDWEST CITY GEARS 
UP TO LAND AN EXISTING TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 St. Louis city and county officials were stunned and disappointed in November 
when the NFL chose Jacksonville as its second expansion franchise over St. 
Louis, which offered the nation's largest television market without an NFL 
team, a new, domed stadium and an attractive financial incentive package. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was little time to mope around, because St. Louis' expansion effort 
was quickly transformed to a relocation effort, with the New England Patriots 
and Rams their primary targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's renewed hope here," said Larry Mooney, chief of staff for St. Louis 
County, which is negotiating the lease for the new stadium. "We have no real 
priority between the Patriots and Rams, we just hope to attract a team 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation concerning the Rams' departure has centered primarily on 
Baltimore, which seems to be offering the most lucrative deal -- a $165 
million, 72,000-seat, 108-luxury-box stadium; $1 rental fee per game, and all 
revenues from tickets, luxury boxes, parking and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mooney believes St. Louis, which has been without pro football since the 
Cardinals left for Phoenix in 1988, is offering a comparable, if not better, 
package. The sales brochure for the Gateway Football Partnership Group, headed 
by Columbia, Mo., businessman Stan Kroenke, includes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A $258-million, 70,000-seat domed stadium, jointly financed by the city, 
county and state, that is already under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 -- All concession, in-house advertising, luxury box and club seat revenues go 
to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The St. Louis Convention and Visitors Commission, which will manage the new 
stadium, will foot the bill for all game-day expenses (ticket takers, ushers, 
concession employees, security personnel, utilities, etc.). That could save a 
team up to $75,000 per game. 
</P>
<P>
 A St. Louis team would have to pay $250,000 in rent per year, but that 
averages out to about $31,000 per game, or less than half of what a team would 
spend on game-day expenses in another stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still feel we're the best market for a pro football team," Mooney said. 
"Unfortunately, we didn't have a unified St. Louis community effort (during the 
expansion process). There were too many conflicts between the St. Louis NFL 
Partnership and Gateway Partnership groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Financing for the NFL Partnership, headed by Anheuser-Busch distributor Jerry 
Clinton, fell apart in October, just before the expansion votes. The Gateway 
Group emerged with strong financial backing in late October, but infighting 
among the leadership groups seemed to scare off many NFL owners, who cast their 
final expansion vote for Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups are still in the hunt for NFL teams, and both reportedly have made 
contact with the Rams. The Gateway group appears to be concentrating its 
efforts on the Patriots, but if a $700-million Megaplex project for the Boston 
area is passed by Massachusetts legislators, the Patriots will stay in New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has reportedly had the more serious talks with the Rams, and he 
announced Dec. 31 that he had secured $100 million for the purchase and 
relocation of another team. If the Patriots remain in New England, the Gateway 
group would likely step up its effort to lure the Rams.  
</P>
<P>
 "St. Louis has more than one iron in the fire," Mooney said. "We have an 
extremely attractive offer and are very interested in attracting a team."

MADDEN DENIES COMPLETING DEAL TO JOIN ABC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Madden might eventually end up in ABC's "Monday Night Football" booth, 
replacing Dan Dierdorf, but Madden said Friday that reports that a deal has 
already been completed were not accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't decided on anything, and I won't until after the season," Madden 
said from his apartment in New York."This is the fun part of the season and I 
want to enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Post reported that Madden's arrival at ABC is a "mere formality," 
and USA Today said that Madden had recently agreed to a $2.5-million-a-year 
deal with ABC after rejecting a $4-million offer from Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard those numbers from anybody, so that tells me the source for 
these stories is an outsider who doesn't really know what is going on," Madden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these things start out as speculation and the next thing you know 
it's being reported as an announcement. I'm just saying we are a lot of steps 
away from that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying not to think about it (his future), but it's hard because people 
keep calling you up and telling you what they've read. Or they fax it to you." 
</P>
<P>
 A clause in Madden's contract with CBS gives him an out if CBS has no 
football. Asked if he might stay at CBS if it were to get involved in a new 
league, Madden said, "I don't know. I really don't. I might. It would be 
another option to look at." LARRY STEWART

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; NO OFFENSE: JETS FIRE COACH COSLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Jets fired Coach Bruce Coslet on Friday and replaced him with 
defensive coordinator Pete Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we talked on Monday, I didn't think we'd go this way," Jet General 
Manager Dick Steinberg said."But it became obvious there was a difference about 
the offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said he didn't count on Coslet's refusal to give up running the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believed in himself," Steinberg said, "but he was told when he first came 
here to develop an offensive coordinator or bring one in." 
</P>
<P>
 Coslet was hired by the Jets four years ago based on his successful offense at 
Cincinnati. The Jets were 26-38 during his tenure and never had a winning 
record, although their 8-8 season in 1991 got them into the playoffs. They lost 
their first playoff game, 17-10, to the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets were 7-4 this season, but then lost four of their final five games. 
In the final six games, the Jets scored only three touchdowns and 36 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll, meanwhile, coached a defense that produced two shutouts -- 6-0 
against New England and 3-0 against Washington -- and ranked second overall in 
the AFC and eighth in the NFL at 294.5 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Also fired were three offensive assistants -- tight end coach Paul Alexander, 
special team coach Al Roberts and receiver coach Chip Myers. Defensive line 
coach Greg Robinson is expected to be promoted to defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pro Bowl tackle Jumbo Elliott's season ended when he was put on injured 
reserve by the New York Giants because of back problems. . . . The Kansas City 
Chiefs put cornerback Dale Carter on injured reserve because of a broken arm, 
and signed free-agent defensive lineman Keith Traylor.

SANDERS IS THE KEY FOR LIONS; PRO FOOTBALL: WITH MOORE AND LYNCH INJURED, 
DETROIT NEEDS RUNNING BACK AGAINST THE PACKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The question facing the Detroit Lions today is one that would make most teams 
squirm. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when coaches study films until their eyes are red and their wives 
are strangers, is it really possible for one NFL team to defeat another one 
twice in a span of six days? 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" asked defensive lineman Marc Spindler of the Lions. "Happens all 
the time in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining that theme, the Lions will try to shut out a group of big swingers 
who have as many strikeouts as hits in their first-round playoff game today 
against the Green Bay Packers at the Silverdome. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first meeting between these two Central Division rivals, Green Bay 
outgained Detroit in total yardage, 404-205, and won, 26-17. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week in Pontiac, the Lions forced Packer quarterback Brett Favre into 
throwing four interceptions and his teammates to fumble four times in a 30-20 
Lion victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, Barry Sanders, the Lions' standout running back, played in the 
first game but sat out the second because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 He practiced this week and is expected to try to play today for the first time 
in six weeks. With both backups, Derrick Moore and Eric Lynch, injured, he is 
needed more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll wait for Barry until five seconds before the game. He is that important 
to us," Coach Wayne Fontes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packer defense, ranked second in the NFL, will be tested at least as much 
by their quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Favre threw a league-high 25 interceptions and constantly put his defense in 
difficult positions by refusing to take a sack. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing this, the Lions' sixth-ranked defense blitzed often Sunday and will 
probably challenge him to adjust today. 
</P>
<P>
 If he does, perhaps making fullback Edgar Bennett as much of a target as 
record-setting Sterling Sharpe, the Packers could have a reversal of fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Favre says he doesn't believe that one team can be beaten by another twice in 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did some things last week that surprised us," he said. "I think there 
will be changes."

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; RUNNING BACKS FINALLY IN PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took 16 games, but the Raiders finally have the three-back rotation they 
wanted in fullback Steve Smith and tailbacks Nick Bell and Tyrone Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 When they play Sunday in an AFC wild-card game against the Denver Broncos, 
Montgomery will be the starting tailback, with Bell coming in on third-down 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raiders got rid of Marcus Allen, Eric Dickerson and Gaston Green 
before the season, they had hoped Bell would be their main running back. But 
that plan never developed because of early-season injuries to Bell and the 
emergence of rookie Greg Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 With Robinson still sidelined because of a knee injury, Montgomery will start 
his first game after rushing for 44 yards in 13 carries in a 33-30 overtime 
victory over Denver last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a childhood dream for me," said Montgomery, the younger brother of 
former NFL running backs Wilbert and Cle Montgomery. "To start in a game with 
such magnitude -- I can't think of this being a big playoff game. I have to 
look at it as just a regular game." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the Raiders will start Montgomery, who played wide receiver in 
college, is that his speed and versatility are a problem for Denver's slow 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, who has rushed for 180 yards in 67 carries, will come in on third downs 
because of his size to help pass block for quarterback Jeff Hostetler. Bell 
also is a solid receiver out of the backfield with 11 catches for 111 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fans picking up tickets at will call for Sunday's game should arrive early 
because of a late rush of ticket sales. Long lines are expected. The will-call 
booths will open at 9:30 a.m., with the Coliseum gates opening at 11 a.m. for 
the 1 p.m. game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Rocket Ismail's status still questionable because of a neck injury, the 
Raiders might activate Daryl Hobbs to fill in at wide receiver. Alexander 
Wright will take Ismail's place on kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Tampa Bay Dec. 19, Wright had his best game as a pro with two 
touchdown catches and 104 yards receiving. But the next week at Green Bay, 
Wright was held without a catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week against Denver, Wright had only two catches for 16 yards before 
catching the touchdown pass that sent the game into overtime. LONNIE WHITE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ohio State basketball Coach Randy Ayers broke his right ankle on Friday when 
he fell on ice outside St. John Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayers underwent surgery Friday night at Ohio State Medical Center. Christopher 
Kaeding, an orthopedic surgeon, inserted a plate and several screws into Ayers' 
ankle. The coach will remain in the hospital a day or two, Kaeding added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayers fell as the team was boarding a bus for the airport and a flight to 
Madison, Wis., for today's game against Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dave Cecutti will coach the team in Ayers' absence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayers should be able to accompany the team to Ann Arbor, Mich., for Thursday's 
game against Michigan, Kaeding said.

SANTA ANITA; CARDMANIA WILL GET A CHALLENGE IN SAN CARLOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In two of the last three years, victory in the San Carlos Handicap has 
signaled success in the Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Farma Way began a four-race Santa Anita winning streak in 1991 with a victory 
in the seven-furlong San Carlos and culminated the run in the $1-million Big 
'Cap. Last year, Sir Beaufort completed the same parlay. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer David Bernstein would love to continue that trend with The Wicked 
North. The 5-year-old son of Far North will begin his year against Breeders' 
Cup Sprint champion Cardmania and five others in the $109,900 San Carlos today. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well late this afternoon, owner Philip Hersh's horse will be 
pointed toward Santa Anita's richest race. Before the Big 'Cap, there would be 
a start in either the San Pasqual Handicap at 1 1/16 miles on Jan. 22 or the 
San Antonio Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything points to a big effort by The Wicked North in the San Carlos. He 
hasn't run since finishing second to Memo in the Smile Handicap on Nov. 6 and 
has a history of running well after a layoff. The Kentucky-bred has also 
trained well, capped by a five-furlong workout in 57 1/5 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's coming up (to the San Carlos) exceptionally well," Bernstein said. "He 
needed some time off after (the Smile) because he'd run two weeks before in the 
Washington, D.C., International. With the shipping and everything, he lost some 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's put the weight back on and he was feeling really good (Monday)." 
</P>
<P>
 A winner of five of his 11 starts, The Wicked North's only off-the-board 
finish in his last 10 races was in the D.C. International. He finished seventh 
of eight in the mile race over a yielding turf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had rained heavily and the course was extremely soft and deep," Bernstein 
said. "We've run him twice on off tracks (he was a distant third behind 
Bertrando in the slop in the San Fernando), and we won't do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wicked North has handled nearly everything else he has been asked to do. 
</P>
<P>
 A winner against 1992 Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Thirty Slews in the Bing 
Crosby Handicap last Aug. 1 at Del Mar, The Wicked North will try to do the 
same to Cardmania, the 7-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, he won the Breeders' Cup, so he'll be tough," Bernstein said. "The 
way I look at the race, Davy Be Good will be in front, (The Wicked North) will 
be just off the pace, then we'll try to hold off Cardmania. I would think that 
would be the scenario." 
</P>
<P>
 Winless in his first 10 races of 1993, Cardmania ended his slump with a 2 
1/2-length victory in the Ancient Title Handicap, 20 days before he rallied to 
beat Meafara by a neck in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 8-year-old Cox's Ridge gelding does make it three consecutive victories 
today, he will become the first 1993 Breeders' Cup champion to win since that 
day. Brocco was beaten by Valiant Nature in the Hollywood Futurity and the 
now-retired Kotashaan was defeated in the Japan Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardmania, who has only two recorded workouts since Nov. 6, is winless in five 
tries at seven furlongs, with two seconds and a third. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to run very well," trainer Derek Meredith said. "He's fit and he's 
training well." 
</P>
<P>
 With the scratch of Arrowtown, the other San Carlos starters are Exemplary 
Leader, who won a turf sprint on opening day; Portoferraio, who won only one of 
14 last year; Davy Be Good, Charts and Monde Bleu. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The career of Music Merci, a multiple-stakes winner, might be over. 
</P>
<P>
 Being prepared Tuesday for a possible start in the San Carlos, the 8-year-old 
gelding suffered pulled ligaments in his right front ankle while working five 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's comfortable, but his future is indefinite," trainer Bill Spawr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beset by injuries and ailments throughout his career, Music Merci finished 
sixth in his last race, the Breeders' Cup Sprint. He has won 12 of 35 and 
earned $1,500,710. His stakes victories include the Del Mar Futurity, Illinois 
Derby, San Rafael Stakes, Malibu Stakes and the Palos Verdes Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Market Booster, who was eliminated at the start of the Yellow Ribbon Stakes in 
her American debut, is the high weight at 120 pounds for the $111,800 San 
Gorgonio Handicap on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now trained by Wayne Lukas, the 5-year-old Green Dancer mare won five of 17 in 
Europe and has trained well for her first start since finishing ninth in the 
Yellow Ribbon on Nov. 14. Chris McCarron will ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the entrants for the 1 1/8-mile race are Skimble, third behind 
Flawlessly and Toussaud in the Matriarch; Gumpher, Dior's Angel, Lyin To The 
Moon, Hero's Love, Miss Turkana, Suivi, Miatuschka and Shooting The Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Wayne Lukas says there continue to be encouraging signs in the 
condition of his son, Jeff. "He's very definitely still in a coma and it's a 
very, gradual long process," he said. "But he's trying to come out of it a 
little bit. He lapses in and out, moving his hands and opening his eyes, but 
he's making good progress." Jeff Lukas has been in a coma since being run down 
by Tabasco Cat in the Santa Anita stable area on Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye will begin a five-day suspension Sunday after having been 
disqualified on Top Of The Sky in Wednesday's seventh race. . . . Ron McAnally 
ended a 22-race slump beginning the meeting when Sun Finger won the fifth race 
on Friday. . . . Trainer Bob Baffert was fined $300 for a medication violation.

ORANGE LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; SAVANNA'S RALLY STOPS WESTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BARZILAI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't pretty, but the Savanna boys' basketball team will take Friday 
night's 50-46 victory over host Western in an Orange League opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna (7-7, 1-0 in league) trailed for most of the game before taking the 
lead with a little over four minutes left, when Dan Avila converted a 
three-point play with a free throw, giving the Rebels a 42-41 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Western makes you look bad," Savanna Coach C.D. Snider said. "They run their 
offense so well, that if it wasn't for Dan Avila, I don't know what would have 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Avila scored seven points in the fourth quarter, and finished with 10 points 
and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Western (8-6, 0-1), which beat Savanna last Thursday, 57-46, took a 26-22 lead 
at halftime, and increased the lead to 35-25 with a 9-3 run to open the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Rebels countered with a 10-2 run, cutting Western's lead to 37-35 
entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to run the ball and they didn't," Snider said. "They were able to 
get some runs and so were we, but they just played their offense so well." 
</P>
<P>
 Western held the ball for nearly two minutes to open the fourth quarter before 
Paul Lindemeyer hit a jump shot. Lindemeyer finished with 11 points and eight 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference down the stretch, though, was Savanna's free-throw shooting, as 
the Rebels converted on all seven attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very proud of that," Snider said. "That is where you win big games and 
championships." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Wilson led Savanna in scoring with 14 points; the Pioneers were led by 
Neil Hensley's game-high 18 points, along with Brandon Brennan's 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a huge victory for us," Snider said. "It gives us a great start to 
the league season, and we're usually not comfortable playing here." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia 67, Anaheim 55 -- Brandon Harvey scored 24 points and Frank Henderson 
21 for Magnolia (1-0 in league) in its league opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia 53, Brea-Olinda 48 -- Valencia (7-8, 1-0) won its league opener 
behind Erik Jackley's 12-point effort.

AYLSWORTH HOLDS CLINIC FOR WESTLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Steve Aylsworth was a child, his father took him throughout the Southland 
in search of the best basketball competition available. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was for Aylsworth to improve his game while learning to cope with 
pressure. And thanks to those often-difficult lessons on playground blacktops, 
Aylsworth is now playing teacher to Westlake High's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore guard came off the bench to score 32 points -- including the 
clinching basket -- in the host Warriors' 57-52 Marmonte League victory Friday 
night over Thousand Oaks, the three-time defending league champion. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a scare late in the fourth quarter, however, when Thousand Oaks 
senior forward Jason Hartman suffered a neck injury and lay motionless on the 
floor for a few minutes. Hartman, who led the Lancers with 17 points and 15 
rebounds, walked off the court under his own power with about 18 seconds 
remaining and applied an ice pack to the back of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the play on the court remained the story -- Aylsworth's play in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the man! He's the man!" Warrior forward Billy Miller shouted in 
excitement at the final buzzer. "I told him before the game that this was going 
to be his night. He was awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Aylsworth, who entered the game with about six minutes remaining in the first 
quarter, scored 16 of his team's 22 points in the fourth quarter as Westlake 
improved to 8-2, 2-0 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thousand Oaks leading, 52-50, Aylsworth made a shot from the top of the 
three-point arc with 3 minutes 16 seconds remaining to give the Warriors a lead 
they would not relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
 The shot capped a fierce fourth-quarter rally for Westlake, which trailed, 
45-35, at the end of three. Aylsworth's performance was especially timely 
because Westlake's big men, Miller and center Erik Bentz, were in foul trouble 
throughout the evening and both fouled out in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really used to coming off the bench, so at first I just wanted to 
come in and help run the offense," said Aylsworth, who did not score in the 
opening quarter. "But when we were down late in the fourth, I knew it was now 
or never, so I put up the shots and they went in." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, which went undefeated in league play last season, dropped to 
9-5, 0-2. Kevin DePiazza scored 11 points for the Lancers.

ATTACK FAILS TO RATTLE KUCHIKI; VIOLENCE AGAINST ATHLETES: CANOGA PARK PAIRS 
SKATER SAYS SECURITY AT U.S. CHAMPIONSHIPS COULD BE BETTER BUT SHE IS NOT 
WORRIED BY KERRIGAN INCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Natasha Kuchiki says she won't be looking over her shoulder today during the 
final day of the U.S. Figure Skating championships at Joe Louis Arena in 
Detroit. But no one could blame her if she did. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchiki, 17, a former national pairs champion and a resident of Canoga Park, 
was stunned along with the rest of the figure-skating world Thursday by the 
attack by an unknown assailant on Nancy Kerrigan, the defending women's 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are a little crazy in the head," Kuchiki said Friday by telephone 
from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchiki was on the ice with partner Rocky Marval of New Egypt, N.J., competing 
in the senior pairs technical program when Kerrigan was attacked while heading 
to her dressing room at an adjacent arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan announced Friday that she would withdraw from the competition because 
of a knee injury suffered in the attack. However, Kuchiki said she will not let 
the attack affect her quest for an Olympic berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The security here is OK, but it's not great," Kuchiki said. "It could be 
better. But I'm not really worried at all. This shouldn't affect us at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchiki and Marval, who became Kuchiki's partner in September, finished fourth 
in Thursday's technical program. The duo must place third in the overall 
competition to qualify for the U.S. Olympic team for next month's Winter Games 
in Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying, Kuchiki said, will require a near-flawless performance in today's 
freestyle program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll need just a clean program and we're going to skate the best we can 
skate," Kuchiki said. "I think we have a good chance. It's been going really 
good. We've been pressed for time, but we've been cramming four or five years 
of skating into four months. It's hard at times, but every day it's getting 
better and better." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchiki returned to pairs skating last summer after competing on an individual 
basis for a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with then-partner Todd Sand of Thousand Oaks, Kuchiki placed sixth in 
the 1992 Olympics in Albertville, France, after winning the 1991 U.S. 
championships and placing third in the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 After a disappointing eighth-place finish in the '92 World Championships, 
Kuchiki and Sand parted ways and Sand later hooked up with Jenni Meno of 
Westlake, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Sand and Meno placed first in the technical program in Detroit. Kyoko Ina 
(Guttenberg, N.J.) and Jason Dungien (Troy, Mich.) placed second. Karen 
Courtland (Whippany, N.J.) and Todd Reynolds (Houston) finished third.

CHATSWORTH DUO DENIED ELIGIBILITY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three former Faith Baptist High baseball players seeking athletic eligibility 
at City Section schools met with different fates Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardship petitions of Chad Evanson and Mike Jimenez were denied, while 
Clint Marcus was granted eligibility.All are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus attends El Camino Real. Evanson and Jimenez are enrolled at Chatsworth. 
All three claimed financial hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Evanson, Chad's father, said he was told by City Section Commissioner 
Barbara Fiege that his annual income is sufficient to pay the tuition at a 
private school. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez, who couldn't be reached for comment, received the same news. Fiege 
also could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really confusing and frustrating," Wayne Evanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Evanson criticized the City for a series of delays that three times 
resulted in failure to reach a final verdict on his son's eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision was first expected last fall, but was delayed because of a backlog 
of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Evansons said they have scheduled a Jan. 22 meeting to appeal the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez was contending for a starting outfield position. Evanson, a 
right-hander, was expected to be the team's No. 3 pitcher. STEVE ELLING

PREP NOTES: PACIFICA MOVES KENNEDY GAME TO AVOID BINGO NIGHT

 Because of the following the Pacifica boys' basketball has suddenly developed, 
its Garden Grove League game next week against Kennedy is being moved from 
Wednesday to Thursday night. Wednesday also happens to be bingo night at 
Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica Coach Bob Becker said the school could not handle the bingo and 
basketball crowds on campus the same night.Bingo fans have always been rather 
intense at Pacifica, but until this season the basketball fans were largely 
apathetic. However, Pacifica is 10-1 this season and ranked sixth in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fast-paced style of play is rather infectious," Becker said. "We've got 
people keep coming back for more after they see us play."

 The Costa Mesa-Estancia girls basketball showdown took on added significance 
Thursday night when it was announced before the game that a spare rib dinner at 
a local restaurant would be awarded to this year's series winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa won the first meeting, 52-51, in overtime. Estancia can still win 
the rib dinner if it defeats Costa Mesa by more than a point in the final 
meeting. Also on the line is the prestigious Lady Bell Trophy, which was rung 
by players on both teams before Thursday's game. DAVE McKIBBEN

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: COACH ALSO GETS HER KICKS PULLING STUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neezer Tarleton, Notre Dame High girls' soccer coach, spent her off-season 
crashing through windows and getting blown up by explosives -- not to mention 
getting tackled by Jerry Seinfeld's eccentric TV neighbor, Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarleton has worked as a stuntwoman since landing a small role in the movie, 
"A League of Their Own," and was kept particularly busy in 1993. She recently 
worked in six movies, including the not-yet-released "Naked Gun 33 1/3." 
</P>
<P>
 And in a fall episode of "Seinfeld" set at the U.S. Open tennis tournament, 
Tarleton briefly appeared as tennis star Steffi Graf. In the episode, Kramer 
(Michael Richards) gets a job as a tournament ball boy. During Graf's match, 
Kramer runs onto the court during play to retrieve a ball and inadvertently 
knocks down Graf (Tarleton). 
</P>
<P>
 Tarleton appears only for a few seconds and her face is not shown -- but her 
legs are. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stunt coordinator said, 'The only requirement they have is that you have 
to have athletic looking legs,' " Tarleton said. "It's the only interview I've 
ever been confident going into." FOOTHILL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 One Man's Opinion 
</P>
<P>
 So which team should be No. 1 in college football, Florida State or Notre 
Dame? Who better to ask than Hart tight end-linebacker John McLaughlin, who was 
being recruited by both schools until last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Florida State," McLaughlin said. "I got to say Notre Dame wouldn't want to 
play Florida State again. They'd be afraid Florida State would whup up on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fighting Irish, who beat Florida State, 31-24, on Nov. 13, could finish 
ahead of the Seminoles in a recruiting battle for McLaughlin, however. Florida 
State stopped recruiting McLaughlin last week because the Hart standout said he 
wanted to stay closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After losing his top two players to graduation, Hart basketball Coach Mike May 
knew his team would need a different style this season. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer could the Indians rely on the scoring of standout forwards Matt 
Steffe and David Sanders, so May laid the groundwork for the transition during 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians (16-1) took over the top spot in The Times' regional poll this 
week after defeating City Section power Manual Arts, 67-55, in the championship 
game of the Hart tournament last week. Hart, which also won the Beverly Hills 
tournament, lost its only game Dec. 4 to Santa Barbara, 71-61, in the 
championship game of the Simi Valley tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are probably pretty surprised at what we're doing but I'm not," 
said May, who is in his second year. "We played well in the summer, so I 
thought we would be strong again." NORTHWEST VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 Swan Song Blues 
</P>
<P>
 The envelope, please. 
</P>
<P>
 The early hands-down winner for area underachiever of the year is . . . San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having three three-year lettermen back from last season -- in which 
the Tigers advanced to the City Section 3-A Division semifinals -- San Fernando 
(6-8) can't seem to get it together. 
</P>
<P>
 So Coach Dick Crowell is taking it all apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait till you see who starts (tonight)," Crowell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowell is threatening to bench several key players for tonight's Northwest 
Valley Conference opener with Cleveland in an attempt to light a fire under the 
team, which he says refuses to practice with intensity. When the team shows up 
for practice at all, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowell said he called a series of practices during the holiday break and had 
no more than six players show up at any session. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Javy Ramos, an All-City pick who averaged 17.5 points as a 
junior, is struggling to find the range from the perimeter, once his offensive 
strength. Ramos, the North Valley League's most valuable player last season, is 
averaging 12.2 points and seems reluctant to shoot from outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told him that shooters shoot their way out of slumps," Crowell said. 
"The last game, he wouldn't shoot at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning front court starters Jerome Elliott and Barry McWright also have 
been inconsistent, Crowell said. Elliott, though, has raised his point 
production from 14.1 points a year ago to 15.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowell, who is resigning at season's end, said this isn't the way he 
envisioned things in his final campaign. In fact, he stuck around the past two 
seasons so he could reap the fruits of the senior trio. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, it hasn't been as fun as I thought," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week Taft Coach Jim Woodard, who watched Reseda beat Grant in the 
final of the Birmingham tournament, predicted the Regents might finish the 
season unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda Coach Jeff Halpern didn't take this compliment, well, lying down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're breaking out the hip boots," Halpern cracked. "I'm carrying a big 
shovel for all the bull. It's a war of psychology and we see it as exactly 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don't wish Granada Hills boys' soccer Coach Pete Mabie luck by saying, "Break 
a leg." It might happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Highlander players sustained broken legs during the first four days of 
practice last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, we practice hard," Mabie quipped, to ease the pain. "But the nurse got 
very tired of running down to the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The three players -- Julio Vasquez, Shane Oren and Keith Evans -- all have had 
their casts removed and could return within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Granada Hills goalkeeper Nevin Smith is recovering from a broken 
thumb, and Evan Bernstein likely will miss the remainder of the season because 
of a knee injury. FRONTIER LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 12 Years, No Rust 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the 12-year itch. Calabasas girls' basketball coach Steve Padaro, who 
coached the Coyotes from 1977 to 1981 and guided the Coyotes to a Southern 
Section runner-up finish in 1981, is back at the Coyotes' helm after a 12-year 
layoff. 
</P>
<P>
 A social studies and business teacher since leaving coaching a dozen years 
ago, Padaro contented himself with supervising players in his physical 
education classes. But a coaching vacancy in the fall prompted school 
administrators to ask Padaro to return to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 He accepted a couple weeks before the season began and led the once-hapless 
Coyotes (3-17 last season) to six victories in their first nine games. His 
chief task: Raising his players' self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "They still see themselves as, 'We're Calabasas and we're going to get our 
butts kicked,' " Padaro said. "They don't believe they're as good as they are." 
</P>
<P>
 But that attitude is changing, thanks to Padaro and standout forward Melissa 
Krolik, who averages more than 20 points and 15 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our next goal is to win a league game," Padaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas, which posted only one league victory last season, opens league play 
today against Santa Paula.

<P>
 The Moorpark boys' soccer team, which competes in tiny Division V, is playing 
like a giant. The Musketeers have won 14 of 16 matches, including convincing 
victories over Buena, Notre Dame and Chaminade, and won the Royal tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Russo and Brody Trejos each has 12 goals and seven assists. Paul Dojo and 
Curtis Silverest each has eight goals and six assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Musketeers' heady start has them wishing in vain for a matchup with nearby 
Division I power Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys want to play Royal really bad," Coach Mike Scanlon said, "because 
our guys know they can beat them." MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Life Goes On 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks girls' basketball team figured to experience a drop-off from 
last season, after losing Marion Jones, the state Division I player of the 
year, to graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a young team that needs a lot of playing time to eliminate a lot of the 
young mistakes," Coach Chuck Brown said of his Lancers (10-4). "But our young 
players like (sophomore guard) Nicky LaSala and (freshman forward) Jen Detmer 
have begun to play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Those players will have a chance to learn from Jones this weekend. Jones is a 
starting guard for fifth-ranked North Carolina and the Tar Heels' game against 
Northwestern will be nationally televised today. Around the Leagues. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * L.A. Baptist's Landon LaPack, who is averaging 18 points a game, set a 
school record by making six of seven three-point baskets against Nordhoff in 
the Fillmore tournament. Teammate Jeff Baumsteiger set a school record with 12 
of his team's 32 steals against St. Bonaventure. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last month's Bell-Jeff tournament was a festive affair for the fabulous 
Baker Brothers of Burbank. Senior Brian Baker made the all-tournament team for 
the varsity and his sophomore brother Matt was selected the most valuable 
player of the junior varsity tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * How's this for a youth movement? Brenda Escobar, a freshman forward, leads 
the Alemany girls' soccer team in scoring with eight goals. Escobar skipped a 
grade prior to high school and is only 13. The Indians' other forward, Alison 
Clapp, is also a freshman, and has three goals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rachel McSorley has led the Nordhoff girls' basketball team to 10 wins in 
its first 13 games, including victories over Hart and defending Division III-AA 
champion Inglewood Morningside. McSorley, a 6-foot-3 senior, averages 17.5 
points and eight rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Newbury Park girls' basketball team has three players averaging in 
double figures in points: Kara McKeown (10.9), Jann Thorpe (10.7) and Julie 
Wastell (10.6). The trio has powered the Panthers to a 11-2 record, both losses 
coming to Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Hart girls' basketball team, defending Foothill League champions, 
appears to have turned around after starting 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the Indians' top six players missed those games, but after they 
returned, Hart won eight of 11. Point guard LaCresha Clark averages eight 
points and five assists.

HAGINS ENROLLS AT SAN DIEGO STATE; BASEBALL: STANDOUT CATCHER, WHO WAS RELEASED 
FROM LETTER OF INTENT TO ARIZONA STATE, WILL BE ELIGIBLE THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephan Hagins, a former standout catcher for University High who filed a 
lawsuit against Arizona State over the school's refusal to allow him to play 
baseball because of a heart-valve condition, has enrolled at San Diego State 
and will be eligible to play for the Aztecs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagins, who dropped his suit in December in exchange for ASU releasing him 
from his letter of intent, had hoped to play at Pepperdine and also was 
considering Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pepperdine officials, apparently leery of taking a risk on a 
student-athlete with a heart condition, backed off. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the last moment, they decided to avoid the situation," said Hagins, who 
batted .507 and earned Times All-Orange County honors at University in 1993. "I 
don't know what happened. I really liked Pepperdine, but I'm excited about 
going to San Diego State. I've heard good things about their program, and I 
hope I can help them win a national championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Smith, a Newport Beach attorney who handled the suit against ASU, said 
Hagins has received clearance from the Collegiate Commissioners Assn. to play 
this season. Most student-athletes have to sit out a year after transferring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagins expects to begin practicing with the Aztecs Jan. 18. He said his 
application for admission has been approved, and he will receive an 85% 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward, not backward," said Hagins, who took some batting 
practice at Corona del Mar High Friday and has been lifting weights for two 
weeks. "The whole (ASU situation) is behind me now." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagins began running into roadblocks last summer, when UCLA Medical Center 
cardiologist Joseph Perloff, after examining Hagins, strongly advised him to 
"desist from competitive sports." Perloff deemed Hagins' aortic stenosis -- 
which involves a defective heart valve that can be clogged over a period of 
time -- to be worse than previously diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagins, who had been medically cleared to play throughout high school, 
underwent an aortic valvuplasty to clear the aorta Aug. 11, but ASU, fearing 
for Hagins' health and possible litigation should he suffer a catastrophic 
injury, didn't allow him to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagins filed suit Nov. 29, claiming the school's actions constituted handicap 
discrimination under federal law, and eventually settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagins said he received medical clearance from Dr. Patrick Bergin, a Eugene, 
Ore., cardiologist, in December, and San Diego State Coach Jim Dietz said 
Hagins has been cleared by team physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really that big a deal," Dietz said. "We already have kids playing 
here with heart conditions. One young man on my team has a bad heart murmur, 
but I'd rather not say who it is because it might affect him in the draft. I 
don't know why (Arizona State) made such a big deal out of it."

ANGELS OFFER CONTRACT TO FREE-AGENT RELIEVER OLSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels offered free-agent bullpen stopper Gregg Olson an incentive-laden, 
multiyear contract proposal that would make him one of their three highest-paid 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Moorad, Olson's agent, was presented with a proposal Friday that would 
pay Olson close to $3.5 million if he stays healthy in 1994.The offer was made 
by Angel President Richard Brown, General Manager Whitey Herzog and assistant 
Bill Bavasi in a one-hour meeting at Anaheim Stadium, and discussions are 
expected to continue next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've put together a beginning package," Bavasi said, "and we'll talk again 
next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson, who earned $2.35 million last season and became a free agent Dec. 20 
when the Orioles did not tender a contract to avert salary arbitration, also is 
being pursued by the Braves, Blue Jays and Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson, who saved 29 games last season with a 1.60 earned-run average, is 
expected to be offered incentive-laden deals by each of the interested clubs

 Rite Aid to close 200 Stores: The Pennsylvania-based retail chain, which has 
2,681 drugstores, said it will also sell its auto parts, book and dry cleaning 
outlets and buy back 22 million shares of stock.The actions will prompt a 
charge against earnings of $149.2 million, the company said. Rite Aid earned 
$23 million during the same quarter in 1992. Sales were $1.08 billion, up from 
$1.01. Like other drugstore chains, Rite Aid has been buffeted by health care 
cost-containment efforts in the private and public sectors, said analysts, who 
generally approved of the restructuring plan.
