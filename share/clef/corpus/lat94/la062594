MINISTER QUITS IN ANGER OVER MEXICO ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Interior Minister Jorge Carpizo MacGregor resigned Friday in a move that 
undercut the credibility of this nation's planned presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am more than angry, I am indignant and disillusioned," he wrote to 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in a resignation letter in which he accused 
politicians of lies and libel in connection with preparations for the Aug. 21 
vote. "One has to know when to leave. That moment, for dignity and conviction, 
has arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas refused to accept the resignation. He said in a statement that talks 
with Carpizo -- a former attorney general and chairman of the government human 
rights commission -- will continue through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether Carpizo ultimately resigns, the political salvo he fired Friday 
"is a serious blow to the whole electoral process," analyst Jorge Castaneda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico is in the midst of its most closely contested election in more than six 
decades. Analysts have insisted that clean elections may be the most critical 
means to diffuse the growing threat of social unrest. In the last year, Mexico 
has suffered a peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, the 
assassination of the leading presidential candidate and a rash of kidnapings of 
prominent executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpizo's appointment to head the Interior Ministry -- which has been the 
government agency traditionally blamed for questionable or unscrupulous 
electoral conduct -- was considered the best guarantee of a fair vote in a 
country where election fraud has been so endemic as to almost become part of 
the national folklore. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because integrity has been Carpizo's main political asset. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carpizo, who vowed Friday to never again accept a political appointment, 
said he could no longer work impartially with one Mexican political party 
because of actions by one of its sectors. He did not specify which party. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Mexican stock exchange, investors reacted quickly to news of Carpizo's 
resignation. The Bolsa stock index, which had been down 20 points before the 
news hit, plunged to a loss of 55.66 points for the day, to 2,187.27. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party, or PRD, an outspoken opposition party, immediately blamed 
each other for Carpizo's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRD -- whose presidential candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is widely 
believed to have lost the 1988 presidential election because of fraud -- has 
been highly critical of measures that officials have proposed to prevent 
electoral wrongdoing in the August presidential vote. 
</P>
<P>
 PRD activists earlier this month applied for and received duplicate voter 
credentials, then showed them publicly to prove just how easily the system 
could be duped. Election officials responded by filing legal action against 
them. In its statement, the ruling party called on the PRD to "get rid of its 
confrontational attitude and to avoid obstructionist actions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cardenas, after speaking to a business conference in southern Mexico, told 
reporters that he believed that Carpizo had "meant the ruling party" had 
prompted his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, divisions within the ruling party have also grown evident as its 
presidential candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, publicly attacked former Mexico City 
Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis for failing to get a peace agreement with rebels in 
Chiapas. Camacho Solis, whom many consider a proponent of more democracy, 
resigned. "With that, Zedillo's supporters became determined to seat him in the 
presidential chair," said economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O. 
</P>
<P>
 Other opposition parties released statements urging Salinas not to accept 
Carpizo's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican election officials have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on voter 
registration rolls and an accreditation system, as well as a sophisticated 
computer setup to count votes. 
</P>
<P>
 All this effort has been aimed at averting a national embarrassment similar to 
what occurred in 1988: While opposition candidate Cardenas was in the lead, the 
computerized national vote-counting system suspiciously crashed; Salinas went 
on to win the contest by the narrowest margin ever accorded a PRI candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides concerns about elections, analysts have said it was critical to have a 
politician of Carpizo's integrity in the Interior Ministry because of the 
agency's involvement in other delicate issues: The ministry, for example, is 
overseeing the controversial investigation into the assassination of 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, which is being conducted by a 
special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans have already expressed grave doubts as to whether the investigation 
will fairly determine Colosio's killer.

JAPAN'S HATA RESIGNS AS PREMIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing a no-confidence motion he admitted he could not defeat, Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata resigned today and said he would "entrust my future" to 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, elected prime minister only eight weeks ago, said he is stepping down to 
avoid a general election that he said would have thwarted political reforms 
enacted last March after a five-year struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing a prime minister in the lower house also would enable Japan to send a 
leader not threatened by an ouster to the annual Group of Seven economic summit 
in Naples, Italy, July 8-10, he noted in a televised news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata's dramatic decision was made less than an hour before a plenary session 
of the lower house was scheduled to vote on a no-confidence motion submitted 
Thursday by the Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had lost the vote, Hata would have had to dissolve the lower house and 
call snap elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan cannot afford a monthlong hiatus in politics" that such a series of 
events would have caused, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the balloting for a new prime minister would occur was not immediately 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata's declaration that he would "entrust my future" to Parliament meant he 
was not ruling out running as a candidate again. 
</P>
<P>
 But his chances of reelection appeared uncertain. With no party holding a 
majority, another coalition will be needed to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, who led Japan's first minority administration in decades, said he would 
bow to the Parliament's decisions in naming a new government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our most urgent task is to form a stable government," Hata said. "I want to 
avoid a political vacuum by every means." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa was forced to host the Group 
of Seven economic summit in Tokyo in the middle of a campaign for a general 
election that he called after the lower house passed a no-confidence motion 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, along with Ichiro Ozawa, his chief strategist -- both of whom bolted the 
Liberal Democrats to appeal for political reform -- led the rebellion against 
Miyazawa. A subsequent election in July sealed the end of the Liberal 
Democrats' 38-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two days ago, Hata said he was willing to resign -- but at that time, he 
made the offer on the assumption that the Socialist Party, which bolted his 
coalition April 26, would support him for reelection. On Friday, the Socialists 
withdrew that assurance, precipitating consultations and bargaining that 
continued until early today.  
</P>
<P>
 Wataru Kubo, the Socialists' secretary general, informed Ozawa on Friday 
afternoon that his party would not again support Hata, reneging on more than a 
month of declarations that Hata's "voluntary" resignation would provide a 
face-saving prerequisite for the party's return to the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa immediately withdrew the offer of Hata's resignation and went to the 
prime minister's office. Nearly 10 1/2 hours later -- at 3:30 a.m. today -- 
Ozawa emerged, saying only that consultations with the Socialists "are not over 
yet." He refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon talks suggested that Ozawa opposed Hata's decision to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hata announced his resignation less than eight hours later, Socialist 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a news conference that his party "at the 
moment, is not thinking of a Socialist-Liberal Democrat coalition." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said consultations with Hata's coalition parties should be 
continued and expanded to include the splinter New Party Harbinger of Masayoshi 
Takemura, who served as chief Cabinet secretary in the coalition government 
until the departure of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in April. 
Although the New Party Harbinger voted for Hata as prime minister, it refused 
to join his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama noted that the current session of Parliament is scheduled to end 
Wednesday. If negotiations on a new coalition cannot be completed by then, he 
said, his party would support extending the session for a short period to 
permit election of a prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialist leader agreed with Hata that a stable government with majority 
support is needed to cope with a host of issues facing the nation. A Socialist 
return to the coalition, by itself, would give the ruling group a razor-thin 
majority of only one seat in the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists' departure from the Cabinet in April left the coalition with 
only 37% of the seats in the lower house. Only the necessity to enact Japan's 
1994 budget -- which passed the upper house Thursday -- forestalled a challenge 
to Hata at that time.  
</P>
<P>
 Murayama's specific reference to the New Party Harbinger suggested that the 
Socialists might back Takemura as Hata's successor. But he did not rule out 
backing Hata. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Democrats on Friday suggested that they would be willing to support 
Murayama as prime minister, with their own leader, Yohei Kono, as vice premier 
in a coalition between the two parties that have been at each other's throats 
since 1955, when both came into existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the offer was sincere or merely an attempt to thwart the Socialists' 
reunion with the coalition was unclear. No Socialist has been touted as a prime 
minister since 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the party gradually has shed its Marxist ideology and advocacy 
of a socialist economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But it still maintains friendly relations with Communist North Korea, 
advocates strong government subsidies for welfare and favors reducing defense 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Its opposition to an opening of Japan's rice market and its refusal to support 
an increase in a 3% consumption tax plagued Hosokawa during his eight months in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Socialists and the Liberal Democrats have condemned what they call 
"arbitrary, high-handed" decision-making by Ozawa. But they are united on few, 
if any, other policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura is an archenemy of Ozawa, Hata's strategist. While Ozawa supports 
Japan playing a larger role in international politics and U.N. peacekeeping 
efforts, Takemura advocates Japan assuming the posture of a "small country that 
sparkles," shying away from both overseas military activities and a global 
leadership role

JUDGE, IN STUNNING MOVE, VOIDS GRAND JURY PROBE OF SIMPSON; COURTS: JURIST SAYS 
PANEL HAS BECOME AWARE OF POSSIBLY PREJUDICIAL MATERIAL AND SEALS ALL RECORDS. 
PRELIMINARY HEARING IS SET FOR THURSDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FOR; RICHARD SIMON, ; RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a stunning and apparently unprecedented legal development in the O.J. 
Simpson double murder case, the supervising judge of the Los Angeles Superior 
Court on Friday stripped the grand jury of its role, closing off a possible 
indictment of the jailed football legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Cecil J. Mills ruled that some people on the 23-member panel had "become 
aware of potentially prejudicial matters" -- presumably tapes of emergency 
calls to 911 in which a man identified as Simpson is heard screaming 
obscenities after kicking in the door of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson's home. 
Mills issued the order after O.J. Simpson's attorney Robert L. Shapiro filed an 
unusual motion to halt the secret legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the unique circumstances of a compelling case blanketed in media 
attention -- and saying he must "protect the due process rights of Mr. Simpson 
and the integrity of the grand jury process" -- Mills ended the panel's 
involvement in the case, sealed all related records and ordered jurors not to 
discuss any details about the case learned in five days of closed-door 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest, extraordinary turn in the 13-day saga that has captivated the 
nation means that Simpson, who has been charged with two counts of murder, will 
proceed to a preliminary hearing scheduled to begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervising judge, who took the unusual step of personally intervening in 
proceedings under the purview of other jurists, said he acted after conducting 
a personal inquiry, apparently interviewing grand jury members. In nationally 
televised proceedings in which Simpson made his third court appearance this 
week, Mills said he found that jurors had been exposed to possibly prejudicial 
information "not officially presented to them by the district attorney."  
</P>
<P>
 One juror who requested anonymity acknowledged that he heard tapes of the 911 
calls while watching TV at home, and he believed that other jurors had too. But 
he said the tapes were never brought up in the jury room, or among fellow 
jurors in casual conversation, at least in his presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be surprised if there weren't any who did not see it," he said. "The 
only way you could avoid it was not watch TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills' action followed a morning hearing in another court where Shapiro cited 
erroneous reports about a bloody ski mask supposedly found at the crime scene 
as an example of law enforcement creating innuendo about his client, who has 
pleaded not guilty.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark acknowledged in court Wednesday that no such 
mask was recovered. But on Friday she disclosed that "a blue knit cap was 
found" at the foot of one of the victims outside Nicole Simpson's Bundy Avenue 
townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark accused Shapiro of grandstanding for holding numerous news conferences 
and trying to win sympathy for the ex-football star by having his friend Robert 
Kardashian read what appeared to be a suicide note June 17, while Simpson was a 
fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 With the case continuing to play out in the free-for-all jury room of public 
opinion as well as the staid courts of law, both sides put a favorable face on 
Friday's developments. Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti called a news conference to 
insist that the dismissal of the grand jury was not a setback for his office. 
"I don't see any loss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the balance of victory Friday clearly appeared to be Simpson's. His 
lawyers had been angling to avoid a grand jury indictment, which would preclude 
a speedy preliminary hearing where witnesses and evidence could be challenged. 
Shapiro and his team want to gauge the strength of the case against the 
46-year-old actor and sports commentator, who stands accused of killing his 
Nicole Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman in a knife attack the night 
of June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased the judge agreed with our position," Shapiro told 
reporters packed in the hallway outside Mills' courtroom. "We look forward to 
finally presenting this evidence in a public courtroom . . . to hearing live 
testimony under oath from the witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Later at a news conference, Garcetti said that in his 25 years in the district 
attorney's office, he had never heard of or seen the recusal of a grand jury. 
He insisted that he initiated the process that led to Mills' order, saying he 
did not learn of Shapiro's motion until half an hour after his meeting with 
Mills on Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said he went to the supervising judge about the same time Shapiro 
filed his motion because he was concerned about the pervasiveness of the 
coverage in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did this because I'm interested in justice," Garcetti said. "I wanted to be 
sure the grand jury proceeding was going forward fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was particularly concerned about heavy coverage of the chilling 
tapes of the 911 calls, even though grand jurors had been told not to view, 
listen to or read any reports about the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti acknowledged that he had another motive as well. If the grand jury 
issued an indictment, and later it was revealed that members had been exposed 
to prejudicial information, it could undermine the indictment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro declined to discuss Garcetti's portrayal of the events. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is scheduled to be disbanded Thursday, when its term expires. 
The judge's order applied only to the Simpson case; the panel presumably will 
be allowed to conclude any pending work on other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 At times Friday, the already remarkable case appeared to be careening through 
a new zone of confusion and miscommunication. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, who heard the arguments on Shapiro's motion 
at a morning hearing, was not aware that Judge Mills, at that very moment, was 
holding another hearing to determine if the grand jurors knew things about the 
case that had not been formally presented to them by the district attorney's 
office, Garcetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito and Mills did not return calls to their offices seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing before Ito, Simpson's team went on the offensive. Shapiro 
accused prosecutors of misconduct in releasing information that he contended 
prejudiced grand jurors, including the release of the tapes of calls to 911.  
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, everything that was said on the tape . . . would be inadmissible," 
Shapiro argued. In court papers, Shapiro went on to cite other examples of what 
he called "prejudicial and improper expressions of personal opinions by 
prosecutors, and uncorrected false and misleading descriptions of evidence 
uncovered in the investigation of this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro recounted Clark's categorization of Simpson as the sole murderer and 
Garcetti's speculation that the former football star might admit killing his 
ex-wife and her friend but would claim a defense similar to that of the 
Menendez brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district attorney's office has improperly released, and massive publicity 
has been given by the media, to inadmissible evidence in this case, the best 
example of which was the massive airing on virtually all television and radio 
stations in Los Angeles of the 911 tape," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before any charges were brought or conclusive tests could be run, the public 
was made aware of bloodstains on driveways, matching blood types, bloody gloves 
and the alleged weapon that was revealed to be a military shovel that was later 
dismissed and called a knife, which has never been found," Shapiro argued in 
papers filed with the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson defense co-counsel and constitutional law expert Gerald F. Uelmen, 
appearing at Shapiro's side in Ito's courtroom, said "the barrage of publicity" 
surrounding the Simpson case has been "unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clark said the district attorney's office had done nothing improper. 
"Robert Shapiro has lost no opportunity to exploit coverage in this case to get 
sympathy for his client," she said. "He has been no stranger to the spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
 Famed defense attorney F. Lee Bailey said Friday that Shapiro and Uelmen 
consulted with him before filing the motion to dismiss the grand jury. Bailey 
said the first case cited was a 1966 case he handled, Sheppard vs. Maxwell, 
involving Dr. Sam Sheppard. In that case, Bailey said, the prosecution 
"repeatedly made evidence available to the news media that was never offered at 
trial." 
</P>
<P>
 What Shapiro argued Friday, Bailey said, was that "it's just as bad to do that 
with a grand jury as with a trial jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also has consulted Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz on the case, 
Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over the release of the tapes, which has prompted outraged 
calls from the public to police and prosecutors, also continued. Garcetti said 
he was surprised by the release of the tapes and disagreed with City Atty. 
James Hahn's decision to comply with news media requests under the state Public 
Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to Hahn's office indicated that there had been some miscues. 
They said the city attorney's office -- before authorizing the tapes' release 
-- thought that police had spoken with officials of the district attorney's 
office, and determined that the tapes of calls to 911 would not be used in the 
current murder investigation, and could therefore be released. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we thought that had been done, that this had been run by them and 
that the D.A.'s office had no problem with the release of the materials," said 
a source within the city attorney's office. "I think we were given bad 
information by the LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the Police Department tartly declined to join in the 
finger-pointing. "James Hahn's office can blame it on whoever they want to 
blame it on," said Lt. John Dunkin, an LAPD spokesman. "The Los Angeles Police 
Department has no further comment on the matter." 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, police sources angrily placed the blame on their counterparts 
in the district attorney and city attorney's offices. One said that police were 
vehemently against releasing the 911 tapes despite media pressure. The source 
said police officials asked the district attorney's office to give them a good 
reason not to release them -- such as the ongoing murder investigation -- but 
said prosecutors supported their release. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said that someone from the LAPD informed Deputy Dist. Atty. David 
Conn that the department planned to release reports from past incidents 
involving Nicole and O.J. Simpson. Garcetti said no mention was made of the 
explosive audiotape, and said Conn referred the police to the city attorney for 
advice on what they should release. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti did not fault Conn's actions in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of the tapes -- one from an incident in 1989, the other from 1993 
-- also triggered speculation about why law enforcement authorities had 
retained them, and whether they were part of some ongoing investigation of 
Simpson's turbulent relationship with his wife, which had prompted many 
domestic dispute calls to police over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 But police and city officials said Friday that under the city's records 
retention schedule, audiotapes of emergency calls to 911 must be saved for a 
minimum 15 months before they can be reused. So the tape-recording of an 
October, 1993, call from Nicole Simpson was in department storage, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape documenting her call during a 1989 incident came not from the Police 
Department, which had destroyed its copy, but from the files of the city 
attorney's office, which keeps case records for a minimum of five years, 
department representatives said. The incident recorded was prosecuted by city 
attorneys, resulting in Simpson pleading no contest to spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand juror interviewed by The Times could not say whether the tape had 
any impact on his colleagues, but said it had no effect on him. "But I didn't 
understand it except you could hear him shouting in the background," the juror 
said. "The quality of the tape was poor." 
</P>
<P>
 The juror said that grand jurors were not admonished by their deputy district 
attorney adviser not to watch TV. "We weren't warned against it. . . . They 
told us not to watch any programs about the grand jury activities. This was 
just news. It was a surprise to us when it came on." 
</P>
<P>
 The juror would not say how close the jury was to an indictment, nor would he 
offer his opinion on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the evidence presented to the jury, the juror declined to discuss 
any specifics, but said: "Almost everything that the jury knows has been 
reported in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say if you read the papers, you know everything the grand jury 
knows." 
</P>
<P>
 The juror said that he was not polled by the judge before his decision to 
dismiss the jury. But the jury said that the judge's order was read privately 
to the jury before being read in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real relief to be off the case," the juror said. "The character of the 
case was so distasteful." Asked why, he said: "Because they were vicious 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad it's over."

SHOWS THE STATE CAN RETAIN JOBS. THE CHAIN WAS OFFERED A PACKAGE OF FINANCIAL 
INCENTIVES.

<P>
 Marking an important symbolic victory for California's efforts to keep 
businesses from leaving the state, Taco Bell Corp. announced Friday that it 
will keep its headquarters in Irvine, rejecting aggressive overtures from 
states all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Offered half-price on its office rent and a $4-million remodeling package by 
its hard-pressed Japanese landlord, Taco Bell said it would stay in the same 
12-story headquarters in Orange County that it had earlier declared to be too 
small for its expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement, which will preserve 1,000 jobs in Southern California, 
followed a concerted effort by state and local officials to keep one of Orange 
County's best-known corporations from leaving the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are delighted," Gov. Pete Wilson said. "We think that is very, very good 
news, first and foremost because this is a very good and aggressive company 
with very realistic but very exciting plans for future growth. They are also of 
symbolic importance in that we are specifically trying to woo corporate 
headquarters in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's plan to stay brought cheers and high fives from the employees and 
full-time contract workers who gathered in the huge employee restaurant to hear 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding to stay put, Taco Bell executives turned aside a lucrative offer 
from Texas and a personal sales effort by its governor, Ann Richards. The Texas 
package included $10 million in tax breaks as well as the standard fare: no 
income tax, inexpensive land and less onerous government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell, which had been offered dozens of sites in California, Texas and 
Georgia, also said it shelved well-publicized plans to build a campus-like 
complex of low-rise buildings with 400,000 square feet of space and room to 
grow 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican-style, fast-food chain negotiated the rent reduction and 
remodeling package from its landlord, Shuwa Investment Corp., according to a 
Shuwa spokesman. Taco Bell said only that it was too expensive to build a new 
headquarters elsewhere in Orange County or in Texas, where it had been eyeing 
property in the north Dallas suburb of Plano. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's decision came despite a legislative committee's rejection 
earlier last month of a bill that would provide tax credits to large 
corporations that moved in or expanded. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said that 
lawmakers remain optimistic about pushing through some corporate relief this 
year, a factor that may have helped to persuade Taco Bell to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major victory . . . more symbolic than actual," Brown said. "If we had 
lost them, it would have just been another nail in the coffin. We're slowly but 
surely reversing the perception that companies ought to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials also were elated about the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Mayor Michael Ward said the decision shows that "the political winds in 
California have changed, and leaders are realizing that they not only have to 
court business to move to the state, but they also have to court those who are 
already here to remain." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees, nervous about their jobs, were generally jubilant over the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an emotional thing that's been hanging on forever," said Tim Johnson, 
who designs the signs and image of Taco Bell restaurants. "The rumor mill has 
been rampant, and so there's a great deal of relief now." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Tapas, an administrative specialist for Taco Bell, said she almost 
cried when she heard the news. "It would've broke my heart if we left," she 
said. "My family is from Sweden and they love coming out here. The first thing 
they want to do when they visit is go to Taco Bell." 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell decided that the "economics of building a new facility just didn't 
make sense in today's environment," John E. Martin, Taco Bell's chief 
executive, said in prepared remarks Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing regional slump in the real estate market has wreaked havoc on 
Shuwa. The beleaguered Tokyo-based real estate investment company had borrowed 
heavily to expand its portfolio of properties in the 1980s, at the height of 
the market. It simply could not afford to lose a major tenant, and offered Taco 
Bell rock-bottom prices that cut the rent more than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell, which now occupies 280,000 square feet in the high-rise and a 
smaller adjacent building, may later be able to lease up to four additional 
floors in a nearby building. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell quietly began its search for a new headquarters a year ago. The 
company wanted to build its own corporate headquarters -- preferably a series 
of interconnecting low-rise buildings arranged in a campus-like atmosphere with 
room to grow to 600,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The company gathered a team of experts, including the Cushman Realty Corp. and 
Gensler & Associates architects, to search the nation for a new site. 
</P>
<P>
 By late fall, the team was concentrating on sites in and around Atlanta and 
Charlotte, N.C., as well as Orange County and Dallas-Fort Worth. The Orange 
County sites included the Irvine Spectrum, Rancho Santa Margarita and two 
locations on either side of UC-Irvine, one promoted by UCI and the other by the 
Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of March, the search had been limited to the Irvine Spectrum and 
the Legacy business park in Plano. 
</P>
<P>
 A last-ditch effort by California was mounted March 28 in a meeting at Irvine 
City Hall. It was the biggest gathering of local and state officials and 
business leaders to meet with Taco Bell officials. Gov. Wilson three days 
earlier had talked with Martin by telephone urging him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said later that until that meeting, the company was "this close" to 
moving to Texas, but California officials "got religion" and began to offer 
inducements to keep the company here.  
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Eric Bailey in Sacramento and Debora Vrana in Costa Mesa 
contributed to this report. Ringing Up Profits 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell has had steady success during the last five years. During that 
period, net sales nearly dobled while operating profits increased 131%. Net 
sales and operating profits, in millions: 
</P>
<P>
 Net Sales: $2,901.3 (1993) 
</P>
<P>
 Operating Profits: $253.1 (1933) Market Diversity 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell has proved a a hit both at home and over the border. During the 
1988-93 period, average domestic sales per unit leaped 57%. And worldwide 
system sales more than doubled. Average unit sales in thousands, worldwide 
sales in billions: 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic Unit Average: $925 (1993) 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide Sales: $3.9 (1993) Restaurant Growth 
</P>
<P>
 Mirroring its increased sales and profits, Taco Bell has continued to open 
more restaurants in the last five years, increasing the number 68%. 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 4,921 Nibbles and Bits 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell accounted for more than 70% of the domestic Mexican-style fast food 
restaurant market last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the company's $ 3.9 billion worldwide sales $3.8 billion was in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 1993 worldwide sales increased $441 million over 1992 figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the increase in 1993 net sales and operating profits resulted from $89 
million in sales of additional restaurant units.

DOLLAR TUMBLES AS BID TO BUOY CURRENCY FALTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a day of financial turbulence and political finger-pointing, the dollar 
tumbled Friday, as an alliance of 17 nations failed in its bid to buoy the 
beleaguered U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, stocks plunged and bond yields jumped amid fears that the Federal 
Reserve would have to raise interest rates to make the dollar more attractive 
-- which could slow U.S. growth and hurt company profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Central banks of countries as large as Germany and as small as Portugal teamed 
up to buy billions of dollars in their rescue effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a brief, midmorning recovery, the greenback wilted further, 
prompting criticism of President Clinton's leadership and fears of higher 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe Ireland defending the U.S. currency?" said William V. 
Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds in New 
York. "Things are bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 62.15 points Friday, the sharpest 
one-day fall in almost three months. The dollar finished the day at 1.58 German 
marks, its bottom for the year, and 100.42 yen -- slightly above its post-World 
War II low reached earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the search for blame, the rising U.S. trade deficit and prospects of faster 
growth overseas were among the explanations offered Friday by economists. Yet 
political symbolism -- in America and overseas -- may be the driving force 
behind the dollar's current unpopularity with investors, analysts also said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's foreign policy leadership has caused many currency traders to 
downgrade the dollar. Unsatisfactory U.S. trade squabbles with Japan and China, 
an appearance of White House indecision on North Korea and other problems all 
were cited Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensitive to the symbolism of a teetering national currency as well as the 
economic risks it raises, Clinton maintained Friday that the dollar was somehow 
moving in the opposite direction of the healthy U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a development that is puzzling a lot of economists because our 
economy is performing so well," the President told KMOX Radio in St. Louis by 
telephone from Air Force One. "In a funny way the currency values are running 
in the opposite direction of economic strength." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Administration critics seized on the unsettling financial news. Sen. 
Pete V. Domenici (R-N. M.) described the dollar's travails as a "global vote of 
no confidence" in Clinton Administration policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I, among many others, attribute this recent precipitous drop in the dollar to 
a worldwide lack of confidence in U.S. leadership that threatens prospects for 
sustained future U.S. economic growth," he said in a Senate speech. 
</P>
<P>
 One economist, who asked not to be named, offered a more blunt appraisal: 
"Wall Street despises Clinton, because he's a Democrat. There's some of that 
going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the explanation may be found overseas, according to some experts. The 
view that Japan's government may soon fall again has lowered expectations that 
Japan will settle trade disputes with the United States anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, the appearance of weak governments in Japan and the United 
Kingdom takes credibility away from central bank efforts to stabilize the 
dollar and emboldens speculators to gamble that the dollar's plunge will 
continue, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying how can these weakened governments support the dollar?" 
said Sullivan, pointing out the price tag for Friday's rescue operation may be 
in the $4-billion range. "They know there isn't the political will to do this 
on a sustained basis." 
</P>
<P>
 The symbolic benchmark of 100 yen-per-dollar has become a key battle line 
between speculators and central bankers in recent days. The line was breached 
briefly on Tuesday before the dollar edged back upward. The dollar also flirted 
with 100 yen in early Friday trading. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Fed, which is responsible for protecting the nation's currency, this 
is a major headache. 
</P>
<P>
 If massive dollar purchases prove insufficient to prop up the currency, the 
central bank will face increasing pressure to do so by boosting interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 And such rescue efforts are dubious. Just last month, for example, a concerted 
effort to buy dollars, perhaps in the $5-billion range, combined with a German 
interest-rate cut to calm the markets, but only temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated investments more lucrative to 
investors, thus strengthening the currency. Yet further rate hikes would also 
slow the U.S. economy, which is already cooling off from the hectic pace of 
growth in late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dilemma for the Fed is clear," said Carol A. Stone, an economist at 
Nomura Securities International in New York. "You don't want to make conditions 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other reasons why the Fed would rather not raise interest rates to 
protect the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens the next time the dollar is weak?" asks Richard D. Rippe, chief 
economist at Prudential Securities. "The Fed would be inviting speculation that 
it might tighten again." 
</P>
<P>
 The slumping dollar poses a dilemma for Wall Street as well, where the Dow 
industrial average plunged 139.84 points for the week -- or 3.7% -- to close at 
its lowest finish since May 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, the current economic climate, which features moderate growth and 
next-to-no inflation, would be a prescription for happy investors. Yet rising 
interest rates this year have hammered bond values -- and stock prices have 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
 That pattern was evident Friday, as the 30-year U.S. Treasury issue dropped 
more than 1 1/4 points, or $12.50 per $1,000 face amount; its yield jumped to 
7.52% from 7.4% Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the short run, uncertainty is the dominant issue," Rippe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar began falling early Friday, sliding against the Japanese yen in 
overnight trading to 100 yen, a nearly 50-year low. Shortly after the U.S. 
markets opened for business, the central banks rushed in with large purchases, 
intended to catch speculators off guard and alter the dollar's course for the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed, Germany's Bundesbank and central banks of Japan, the United Kingdom, 
France, Canada, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, 
Portugal, Norway, the Netherlands, Ireland and Spain all reportedly 
participated in the rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the banks' efforts spread through trading rooms at about 9:30 a.m., 
and the dollar rallied for about 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 By midday, however, it lost its momentum and began to drift sideways or lower, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if the episode was unresolved on Friday, few observers were confident that 
the central banks could prevail over the currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd have to do it (buy dollars) on a much larger scale than they did 
today, and I think they'd have to keep doing it repeatedly next week," said 
Bruce Steinberg, an economist with the Merrill Lynch investment firm in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer term, economists said, recoveries in Japan and Western Europe will pick 
up steam, meaning that the demand for U.S. exports will surge -- shrinking the 
U.S. trade deficit -- and the dollar is likely to edge upward once more. 
</P>
<P>
 Short term, however, many were betting on a lower dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the central bank version of the World Cup -- and they're losing," 
Michael Strauss, chief economist at Yamaichi International (America), told 
Reuters.

SUPREME COURT STRENGTHENS RIGHTS OF PROPERTY OWNERS; DEVELOPMENT: RULING LIMITS 
GOVERNMENT POWER TO DEMAND LAND IN EXCHANGE FOR BUILDING PERMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, strengthening the property rights of developers and 
homeowners, put new limits Friday on the power of public officials to seek a 
share of land in exchange for granting a building permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing officials to blithely demand that a property owner give up part of 
his land for such purposes as building a bike path, preserving a wetland or 
creating "open space" violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that "private 
property (shall not) be taken for public use without just compensation," said 
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, speaking for a 5-4 majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see no reason why the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment, as much a 
part of the Bill of Rights as the First Amendment or Fourth Amendment, should 
be relegated to the status of a poor relation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling is the third since 1987 in which the justices have tilted the law 
toward protection of property rights. It marks a setback for environmentalists 
and public officials, especially in California, where developers have been 
pressured to set aside land for the public, whether to walk on the beaches, 
hike in the mountains or enjoy city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, officials tell developers that, before they can build a new 
high-rise office tower or suburban housing tract, they must give up some land 
for parks, schools or jogging paths. California Fish and Game officials have 
sought to protect wildlife, for example, by requiring developers to set aside 
two acres of their land in exchange for building on one acre. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's opinion, the high court did not outlaw these "exactions," but 
instead made it harder for public officials to justify their demands. Rehnquist 
said officials bear the burden of proving that the exactions are needed to make 
up for the impact of expanded development. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling did not provide firm guidelines for determining when officials have 
gone too far. But even if there is "no precise mathematical calculation" for 
such decisions, Rehnquist said, officials must at minimum make "an 
individualized determination" to show that taking the land is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will keep them (officials) honest," said James Burling, an attorney for 
the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento, which defends property rights. "It 
says the government cannot get whatever it wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Other legal experts said the ruling will have its greatest impact behind the 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Municipal land-use regulation has become a bargaining process between the 
developer and the city. And this decision gives a little more leverage to the 
developer," said Washington University law professor Richard J. Lazarus, who 
represented the city of Tigard, Ore., in the case decided Friday. "The city 
can't just make unilateral demands." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years ago, the high court ruled that the California Coastal Commission 
had gone too far when it demanded that James and Marilyn Nollan allow the 
public to walk on their beachfront in Ventura in exchange for getting a 
building permit to enlarge their house. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Justice Antonin Scalia labeled the commission's demand "an 
out-and-out plan of extortion." However, his opinion in Nollan vs. California 
failed to explain precisely when public officials cross the line and violate 
the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest case began in 1989 when Florence Dolan announced plans to nearly 
double the size of her A-Boy Plumbing supply store on Main Street in Tigard, 
outside of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, concerned about possible flooding and increased traffic in the 
downtown area, demanded that she give up a piece of property as "a greenway" 
along a creek behind her store. They also sought an extra 15-foot strip to 
extend a bike and walking path. These exactions amounted to about 10% of 
Dolan's property. 
</P>
<P>
 She refused the city's demand and filed a lawsuit. Oregon state courts sided 
with the city and ruled that its demands were reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court disagreed. City officials failed to show there was an 
"essential nexus" between the extra burden caused by Dolan's expanded store and 
the benefits of the exactions. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling (Dolan vs. Tigard, 93-518) won praise from property rights 
advocates. This was "a clear and simple case of government-sponsored 
extortion," said Nancie Marzulla, counsel for Defenders of Property Rights, a 
Washington legal group. If the city wants land for a bike path, it should pay 
for it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strong dissent that he read from the bench, Justice John Paul Stevens 
said the ruling encourages "the federal judiciary (to) micromanage" delicate 
disputes involving the potential risks of floods, earthquakes, traffic 
congestion and environmental harms. 
</P>
<P>
 In his view, "the public interest in averting (such harms) must outweigh the 
private interest of the commercial entrepreneur," said Stevens, whose dissent 
was joined by Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice David 
H. Souter dissented separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cheered big business by ruling that state judges must review the size of 
punitive damage verdicts (Honda vs. Oberg, 93-644). Judicial review is "a 
safeguard against excessive awards," the court said on a 7-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon is the only state where judges have no authority to review the size of 
punitive verdicts. The high court reversed a $5-million punitive verdict 
against Honda and said that the company is entitled to have that verdict 
reviewed for being arbitrary and excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruled that police officers do not have to stop questioning a suspect if he 
makes an uncertain request to speak to a lawyer (Davis vs. U.S., 92-1949). 
</P>
<P>
 On a 5-4 vote, the justices upheld the murder conviction of a sailor who, 
during a long interrogation, commented: "Maybe I should talk to a lawyer." If 
he had asked for a lawyer, the questioning would have stopped.

BLACKS' HEART DISEASE RATES TIED TO ARTERY CONSTRICTION; HEALTH: BLOOD VESSELS 
RETURN TO NORMAL SIZE MORE SLOWLY THAN IN WHITES, STUDY FINDS. IT MAY LEAD TO 
NEW TREATMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first physical explanation of why African Americans are prone to high 
blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and strokes has been announced by 
researchers who say the findings may open the door to the development of new 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 University of Georgia scientists found that arteries from black patients with 
severe heart disease were unable to return quickly to normal size after they 
had constricted in response to stress or medications. This relaxation is 
impaired, they found, because cells lining the arteries do not produce 
chemicals that stimulate enlargement. 
</P>
<P>
 The sustained constriction increases blood pressure, places extra stress on 
the heart and increases the risk of a vessel rupturing, Dr. Randall Tackett 
reported Friday at the Ninth International Interdisciplinary Conference on 
Hypertension in Blacks, held in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks have a 27% higher death rate from heart disease than whites and are 
twice as likely to die from stroke.  
</P>
<P>
 Tackett's team made the discovery using leftover artery tissue from heart 
bypass recipients to test the arteries' ability to relax. Similar, as yet 
unreported results from a team in New York that used a different technique 
support Tackett's findings, suggesting that researchers may be well along the 
road to explaining the high rate of hypertension and related diseases in 
blacks.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Tackett's findings, the researchers say they now will be able 
to test and develop medications to see which are most effective for blacks. And 
an understanding of the mechanism should make it possible to design highly 
specific new agents targeted at blacks' hypertension, they added. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tantalizing, extremely interesting finding whose significance is in 
its promise" for drug development, said Dr. Stevo Julius of the University of 
Michigan. "But we cannot take it as a resolution of the issue," he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "This helps to explain a number of things that previously seemed 
unexplainable," said Dr. Jan L. Houghton of the Albany Medical College in New 
York. In particular, she added, it shows that the high rate of hypertension and 
related disorders in blacks is "a public health problem, not just a 
sociological problem." Some researchers have previously suggested that the 
susceptibility of blacks to the disorders is socioeconomic and cultural, 
reflecting lack of access to physicians, failure to take prescribed medicine 
and similar factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the difference in blood vessels between blacks and whites is most 
likely genetic in origin, Tackett said, "we can't say that (this is proved by) 
our particular study at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Studying the problem in the laboratory has been extremely difficult because 
there are no animal models that distinguish between races, and ethical problems 
forbid most experimentation on humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent two years identifying tissues that we could use in such studies," 
Tackett said. "Our first idea was to use placental tissues from local 
hospitals," but blood vessels in the placenta are different from those 
elsewhere in the body, he said. That would also exclude males from the study. 
Blood vessels from people killed in traffic accidents were also rejected 
because the tissues would deteriorate in the time required to procure them 
after death. 
</P>
<P>
 Vessels from coronary artery bypass operations, in which a blood vessel from 
the leg is used to replace clogged vessels near the heart, seemed like a good 
possibility. But the supply is limited because, as studies have documented, 
blacks have had much less access than whites to expensive procedures such as 
bypass surgery. Nevertheless, Tackett's team found two cardiovascular surgeons 
in nearby Augusta whose patients included a large number of blacks. Because the 
operations are scheduled in advance, a team member could be present at the 
hospital for the surgery, collect the leftover tissue, and rush the 100 miles 
to their Georgia laboratory to perform tests. 
</P>
<P>
 They used tissue from 60 whites and 22 blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tests, Tackett's group exposed the artery tissue to a drug that caused 
it to constrict, then applied other drugs that would normally cause it to 
relax. Tissues from whites uniformly relaxed rapidly in response to the drugs, 
whereas those from blacks relaxed much less during the same period. With the 
drug acetylcholine, for example, blacks' vessels became only 19% larger during 
the same time in which whites' vessels became 34% larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, biochemical tests showed that the impairment occurred because the 
cells that line the arteries of blacks could not release a chemical that 
normally promotes relaxation. That chemical, the gas nitric oxide, has recently 
been identified as a signaling agent throughout the body, released by one group 
of cells to tell others to carry out a specific function. In this case, nitric 
oxide secreted by the endothelial cells orders the blood vessels to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackett's findings have been confirmed by Albany's Houghton, who normally 
performs cardiac catheterization -- the insertion of diagnostic probes into 
blood vessels near the heart -- in patients thought to be suffering a heart 
attack. If the patient has not had a heart attack, Houghton seeks permission to 
perform an experiment while the catheter is still in position. She administers 
small amounts of the same drugs Tackett used and measures changes in blood 
flow, an indirect measure of vessel relaxation.  
</P>
<P>
 Working with about 400 patients, evenly divided between blacks and whites, she 
found that more than 90% of the blacks had an impaired ability to relax their 
vessels, compared to fewer than 40% of the whites. In whites, furthermore, "you 
have to have a much more severe degree of hypertension for (the problem) to 
show up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Houghton says the two approaches are complementary. "With my work, you have to 
be very careful that you don't hurt the patient doing the study, so you 
probably can't learn as much, as fast. On the other hand, working with the 
intact individual, you are sure that nothing has been changed by the vessels 
being excised." 
</P>
<P>
 She plans to present her results later this year at the American Heart Assn. 
meeting.

COLUMN ONE; THE TEAM DEFENSE: STRENGTH IN NUMBERS?; HIGH-PROFILE ATTORNEYS 
DERSHOWITZ AND BAILEY ADD FIREPOWER TO SIMPSON'S SIDE. SOME LIKE THE COMMITTEE 
APPROACH, BUT OTHERS SAY TOO MANY LAWYERS CAN SPOIL A CASE. 
</P>

<P>
 When Miami criminal defense lawyer Roy Black was hired to defend William 
Kennedy Smith against rape charges, he knew right away he would need help -- 
lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a week he hired two lawyers to assist him in the courtroom and assigned 
a backup team of more than a dozen lawyers and specialists to various duties, 
from research to forensics. 
</P>
<P>
 They lived together in the Kennedys' Palm Beach compound during the three 
weeks of jury selection for the highly publicized 1991 trial, working over 
meals and brainstorming until dawn. During the trial, Black kept a cellular 
phone at the defense table so he could summon other lawyers to research legal 
issues as they arose and call in their findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't that many clients who can afford it," said Black, who won his 
client's acquittal, "but clearly if you can get a team of people, all of whom 
are assigned jobs within their specialties, you can really enhance your ability 
to defend a client." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential advantages of such an approach are driving the intensive efforts 
to mount O.J. Simpson's defense against charges that he murdered his ex-wife 
and a friend of hers. Robert L. Shapiro, a Los Angeles attorney known more for 
his negotiating skills than his courtroom prowess, is methodically assembling a 
team of lawyers and experts to challenge the forensic evidence against his 
client, to prepare and argue motions on the law and assist at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Two legal heavyweights have been advising Shapiro: Harvard University law 
professor Alan Dershowitz, who successfully defended Claus von Bulow, among 
other celebrated clients, and flamboyant veteran trial lawyer F. Lee Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Many criminal lawyers dislike the defense-by-committee approach, complaining 
that it can stifle creativity and discourage risk. But over the last 20 years 
the team defense has grown more popular -- and is seen as increasingly 
necessary -- as the law grows more complex and forensic science more important. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'lone eagle' approach went out with Charles Lindbergh," said Black, whose 
defense in the Smith case emphasized inconsistencies in the woman's statements 
and doubts about her character. "Today, even planes have two people flying 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simpson case, associates of the celebrated former athlete have been 
contacting criminal defense lawyers in Los Angeles. In addition to Dershowitz 
and Bailey, Shapiro added a legal scholar to the team this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of this case is going to turn on (forensic) expert witnesses," said 
Santa Clara University Law School Dean Gerald Uelmen, a former federal 
prosecutor who joined Shapiro at the defense table for the first time 
Wednesday. "This is a defense that will undoubtedly present some very unique 
legal issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring a squadron of lawyers has always been an option for defendants who can 
afford it. Clarence Darrow had a team to help him with the murder defense of 
Nathan Leopold Jr. and Richard Loeb in 1924, who eventually pleaded guilty in 
the thrill killing of a 14-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead lawyer looks for other lawyers with particular skills: one who is 
gifted in the examination and cross-examination of witnesses, another in 
psychiatric defenses or forensic evidence, another in the research and writing 
of motions. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer in charge of the forensic evidence might have a science or 
investigative background, or a familiarity with the matching of fibers, the 
reliability of DNA tests and the interpretation of blood splatters. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood splatters can provide clues about whether the assailant is right- or 
left-handed, and his or her height and position in relation to the victim. DNA 
evidence, which is likely to figure in the Simpson case, is controversial, and 
some lawyers have fought to keep it out of the courtroom because of its 
potential unreliability. A month can be spent arguing the admissibility of DNA 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Experts (witnesses) are good, but they don't know how to translate their 
findings into admissible evidence for the court," Black said. "It's such a huge 
part of the case (that) somebody has to take control over that." 
</P>
<P>
 The research lawyer may spend 15 hours a day in a library preparing drafts of 
various motions. In the Smith case, more than 500 motions and memoranda were 
filed. One motion to postpone the trial was 80 pages. Other motions were filed 
to prevent prosecutors from releasing information to the news media, to quash 
subpoenas and for a change in venue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your responsibility is for a particular subject matter and witness," said 
prominent San Francisco defense attorney Tony Tamburello, who helped defend 
convicted Navy spy Jerry Whitworth and convicted Peoples Temple conspirator 
Larry Layton. "So you can pretty much hone in on that particular subject . . . 
or witness and concentrate as opposed to having to worry about everything else 
in the case."  
</P>
<P>
 The work is often tedious and time-consuming. Whether testifying for the 
defense or the prosecution, expert witnesses must be thoroughly researched. An 
attorney assigned to them would read all of their published articles and 
transcripts from trials in which they had testified to determine their 
weaknesses and strengths on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is usually a very fertile area," Black said, "because they are not 
expecting you to dig up a case in which they said quite the opposite 10 years 
before. That happens quite frequently." 
</P>
<P>
 In selecting a team, the head lawyer often turns to people he or she knows 
personally. They must choose people whose skills complement theirs but who will 
not try to overshadow them. Personalities often clash, and trial lawyers, in 
particular, tend to be accustomed to calling the shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tend to have huge egos, be extremely demanding and be just really 
difficult to work with," said Ted Cassman, a Bay Area criminal defense lawyer. 
"There is very, very often competition between various criminal defense lawyers 
involved in a case." 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal defense lawyer Gerry Spence, who has defended former Philippines 
first lady Imelda Marcos, said it is crucial that team lawyers be willing to 
play subordinate roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a bunch of high-profile lawyers in there, there are going to be 
problems," said the famed Wyoming lawyer, who wears a 10-gallon Stetson to 
court. "They will be like a bunch of maestros, all wanting to play at the same 
time, and the tune can get pretty damn well muddled." 
</P>
<P>
 So much of what happens at a trial is spontaneous, and the trial lawyer has to 
react quickly. "A jury needs to believe you at all times," said Spence, who 
briefly discussed the Simpson case with Shapiro, "and you can't have someone 
whispering in one ear, and somebody else whispering in the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassman has worked on teams with his high-powered partners, Penny Cooper and 
Cristina Arguedas, who both bring different skills to a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, he said, is one of the best cross-examiners he has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "By merely saying 'What?' to a witness, she can get them to recant what they 
just said," he said. "It is magical, and I don't understand how she does it." 
</P>
<P>
 Arguedas, on the other hand, is adept at establishing the theme of a defense, 
organizing a presentation that jurors can easily understand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the three lawyers worked on a drug case, they divided up responsibility 
for certain legal motions and for reviewing evidence by the prosecution. They 
also handled different witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead lawyer in a team defense often holds daily meetings, with written 
agendas. Each team member's duties may be put in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 That was how the Smith defense team operated. "Everybody had in writing what 
their responsibilities were," Black said. "Sometimes with too many cooks, 
somebody thinks somebody else is doing it, and it is not getting done. So the 
managing lawyer has to see that everything is on tap." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simpson case, Shapiro is running the show. He is widely liked as an 
affable, sensitive, decent man whom authorities tend to trust and who can work 
well in achieving favorable plea bargains for his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is not known for defending accused murderers who go to trial, and some 
lawyers believe that inexperience is a handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also has on the defense team Leroy Taft, a corporate and business 
lawyer who has been Simpson's personal attorney, and Robert Kardashian, a 
personal friend.  
</P>
<P>
 The latter two are not experienced in criminal defense and are believed to be 
on the team because of their close relationships with Simpson. Other lawyers 
said they did not expect them to play major roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen studies appellate rulings closely and worked with Shapiro in the 
defense of Christian Brando, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in 
the shooting death of his half sister's lover. 
</P>
<P>
 During that case, the Santa Clara professor successfully argued a motion to 
prevent Brando's statements to police from being used against him, an issue 
that may arise in the Simpson case because he also spoke to police at length 
without a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen also is expected to research and write motions to block prosecution 
evidence against Simpson and to handle issues that the defense may take to 
higher courts. The defense filed a successful motion that resulted in the 
dismissal of the grand jury Friday on the grounds that the jurors had been 
prejudiced by massive publicity about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is an expert in drug abuse law, Uelmen said, "I see nothing that 
will call for that expertise." He also said it was too soon to say whether 
psychiatric testimony will be important. 
</P>
<P>
 Dershowitz has been providing advice on strategy but will not join the defense 
table during the trial. He and Bailey worked together on the defense of 
publishing heiress Patty Hearst, who despite their efforts was convicted of 
participating in a robbery. President Jimmy Carter later commuted her 
seven-year sentence after she served nearly two years. Shapiro represented 
Bailey in 1982 when he was acquitted of drunk-driving charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles attorney Johnnie Cochran predicted earlier in the week that "a lot 
more" lawyers would be added to the Simpson team. He noted that the widespread 
dissemination of the 911 tapes -- in which Nicole Simpson summoned help as her 
ex-husband yelled angrily in the background -- is particularly troubling 
because those tapes might not be admissible in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to having experts on forensic law and possibly on psychiatric 
testimony, Cochran said, Shapiro "might look for somebody who has great trial 
skills, who spends his life in the court. He wants to have all his bases 
covered in the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran said it is best to pick lawyers the chief attorney knows personally, 
but that is not always possible. Shapiro "is going about it very methodically, 
and I think that is good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Southern California defense lawyer said he was approached about working on 
the team but turned it down because he dislikes defending someone by committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Barry Tarlow, who primarily specializes in complicated white-collar 
crime cases, acknowledged the necessity and shortcomings of a team defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an abstract proposition," Tarlow said, "I believe working by committee 
deprives you of the ability to make tough, hard, crisp decisions, deprives you 
of the ability to gamble, to do innovative and novel things because you tend to 
try to reach consensus. . . . It is a difficult approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Others believe that Simpson's defense demands a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get pretty overwhelmed," Black said. "I am sure Shapiro is working 18 
or 19 hours a day trying to hold back the avalanche."

 LIFE SAVER: It was a gut feeling, the Tarzana teen said, which made him pay 
attention a few weeks ago to a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation lesson. His 
heads-up sixth sense ended up saving a little girl's life.On Tuesday, Jeff 
Stauffer rescued a drowning 3-year-old from his apartment complex pool. . . . 
"Something took over, like instinct," Stauffer said (B2). "I didn't really 
think about it."

 MARCH FOR JESUS: For many, the day will be dedicated to Jesus as Christians 
across the nation march today to show their devotion. And that includes many 
from this area. In Santa Clarita, in fact, they're expecting 5,000 to show up 
with banners and flags (B11). . . . Evangelical author John Dawson of Lake View 
Terrace calls the marches an "amazing movement" that brings black and white 
Christians together. 
</P>
<P>
 FAYE'S TURN: The "Sunset Blvd." saga moved Friday to Stansbury Avenue in 
Sherman Oaks. That's where Faye Dunaway (above), on location for a film, gave 
her account of the show's closing (F1). . . . But only a few residents turned 
out to catch a glimpse of the star. "I feel sorry for her," said one neighbor, 
"but I never thought she had a voice." 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT HEAT? It was another hot one in the Valley on Friday, but that didn't 
mean a thing to golfers. As usual, they turned out in heavy numbers. At 
Sepulveda Golf in Encino about 500 players had showed up by mid-afternoon.

SUPREME COURT STRENGTHENS RIGHTS OF PROPERTY OWNERS; DEVELOPMENT: RULING LIMITS 
GOVERNMENT POWER TO DEMAND LAND IN EXCHANGE FOR BUILDING PERMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, strengthening the property rights of developers and 
homeowners, put new limits Friday on the power of public officials to seek a 
share of land in exchange for granting a building permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing officials to blithely demand that a property owner give up part of 
his land for such purposes as building a bike path, preserving a wetland or 
creating "open space" violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that "private 
property (shall not) be taken for public use without just compensation," said 
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, speaking for a 5-4 majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see no reason why the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment, as much a 
part of the Bill of Rights as the First Amendment or Fourth Amendment, should 
be relegated to the status of a poor relation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling is the third since 1987 in which the justices have tilted the law 
toward protection of property rights. It marks a setback for environmentalists 
and public officials, especially in California, where developers have been 
pressured to set aside land for the public, whether to walk on the beaches, 
hike in the mountains or enjoy city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, officials tell developers that, before they can build a new 
high-rise office tower or suburban housing tract, they must give up some land 
for parks, schools or jogging paths. California Fish and Game officials have 
sought to protect wildlife, for example, by requiring developers to set aside 
two acres of their land in exchange for building on one acre. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's opinion, the high court did not outlaw these "exactions," but 
instead made it harder for public officials to justify their demands. Rehnquist 
said officials bear the burden of proving that the exactions are needed to make 
up for the impact of expanded development. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling did not provide firm guidelines for determining when officials have 
gone too far. But even if there is "no precise mathematical calculation" for 
such decisions, Rehnquist said, officials must at minimum make "an 
individualized determination" to show that taking the land is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, developers and city officials said the high court's ruling 
would probably have little effect on how future development deals will be 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oddly enough, we've not had any of the cities in the county make outrageous 
demands for open space or parks," said Bill Teller, assistant vice president at 
Pardee Construction Co., one of the largest residential developers in Ventura 
County. "If a city becomes overzealous in its requirements, it will have an 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Trigg, a spokeswoman for Ahmanson Ranch, said she is unsure what kind of 
impact, if any, the ruling will have on the Ahmanson development, which 
involves the largest open space deal in Ventura County history. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for receiving nearly 10,000 acres of public parklands, the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors has approved a 3,050-home golf-course community in 
the Simi Hills. The deal has been changed since its 1992 approval because of 
court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years ago, the high court ruled that the California Coastal Commission 
had gone too far when it demanded that James and Marilyn Nollan allow the 
public to walk on their beachfront in Ventura in exchange for getting a 
building permit to enlarge their house. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Justice Antonin Scalia labeled the commission's demand "an 
out-and-out plan of extortion." However, his opinion in Nollan vs. California 
failed to explain precisely when public officials cross the line and violate 
the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest case began in 1989 when Florence Dolan announced plans to nearly 
double the size of her A-Boy Plumbing supply store on Main Street in Tigard. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, concerned about possible flooding and increased traffic in the 
downtown area, demanded that she give up a piece of property as "a greenway" 
along a creek behind her store. They also sought an extra 15-foot strip to 
extend a bike and walking path. These exactions amounted to about 10% of 
Dolan's property. 
</P>
<P>
 She refused the city's demand and filed a lawsuit. Oregon state courts sided 
with the city and ruled that its demands were reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court disagreed. City officials failed to show there was an 
"essential nexus" between the extra burden caused by Dolan's expanded store and 
the benefits of the exactions. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling (Dolan vs. Tigard, 93-518) won praise from property rights 
advocates. This was "a clear and simple case of government-sponsored 
extortion," said Nancie Marzulla, counsel for Defenders of Property Rights, a 
Washington legal group.  
</P>
<P>
 In a strong dissent that he read from the bench, Justice John Paul Stevens 
said the ruling encourages "the federal judiciary (to) micromanage" delicate 
disputes involving the potential risks of floods, earthquakes, traffic 
congestion and environmental harms. 
</P>
<P>
 In his view, "the public interest in averting (such harms) must outweigh the 
private interest of the commercial entrepreneur," said Stevens, whose dissent 
was joined by Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice David 
H. Souter dissented separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cheered big business by ruling that state judges must review the size of 
punitive damage verdicts (Honda vs. Oberg, 93-644). Judicial review is "a 
safeguard against excessive awards," the court said on a 7-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon is the only state where judges have no authority to review the size of 
punitive verdicts. The high court reversed a $5-million punitive verdict 
against Honda and said that the company is entitled to have that verdict 
reviewed for being arbitrary and excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruled that police officers do not have to stop questioning a suspect if he 
makes an uncertain request to speak to a lawyer (Davis vs. U.S., 92-1949).

ECONOMICS; LATIN AMERICAN LEADERS FLY IN FORMATION ON FREE TRADE; CUBA'S FIDEL 
CASTRO THE ODD MAN OUT AT COLOMBIAN SUMMIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High-level international summits often abound with empty ceremonial discourse, 
but there was more than pomp and palaver at the fourth annual Ibero-American 
Summit. A growing sense of Latin American unity, a feeling of community, 
emanated from the air-conditioned halls here as Latin America's presidents met 
last week with leaders from Spain and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Latin America's flock of nations seemed to be flying in 
formation -- at different speeds, with much fluttering and flapping and some 
falling out of line here and there. But countries of this huge region are 
beginning to look like birds of a feather. Could it be that liberator Simon 
Bolivar's dream of a great Latin American union is finally coming true? 
</P>
<P>
 Not yet, although it seems more possible than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Latin American countries are drawn together by culture, history and geography. 
And since the beginning of the 1990s, almost all of them also share a common 
denominator of democracy, albeit imperfect. All of this has helped the yearly 
Ibero-American Summit become a friendly forum for promoting regional solidarity 
and integration. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of this year's summit was "Trade and Integration as Elements of 
Ibero-American Development." 
</P>
<P>
 The final declaration, signed by all 21 participating countries, emphasized 
the goal of "stimulating processes of regional integration through free-trade 
agreements and economic complementation." 
</P>
<P>
 In an example of progress toward free trade among economies that once were 
heavily protected by tariff barriers, three major Latin American countries 
signed a new free-trade agreement on the eve of the Cartagena summit. Mexico, 
Colombia and Venezuela -- calling themselves the Group of Three, or G-3 -- are 
to eliminate all tariffs on mutual trade within 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The G-3 pact is the latest of several free-trade agreements in Latin America, 
some overlapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, for example, has a free-trade accord with Chile, as well as being a 
signatory of the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and 
Canada. And Colombia and Venezuela belong to the Andean Pact. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cartagena declaration said the final goal for all subregional trade 
agreements should be their convergence in a single hemispheric project, NAFTA 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 That goal seems more realistic today than it ever might have, partly because 
the consolidation of democracy in Latin America has brought closer relations 
among governments with similar principles and ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes for regional integration are also based on an almost unanimous movement 
by Latin American governments toward policies favoring market economies with 
reduced public sectors and increasingly free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Chilean President Eduardo Frei said after the summit, Latin America 
feels more need than ever for the strength of economic unity as it sees Europe, 
North America and eastern Asia forming powerful trade blocs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the reality," Frei said. "I believe our union is fundamental." 
</P>
<P>
 The odd man out in all of this is President Fidel Castro of Communist Cuba. 
Castro attended the Cartagena summit and signed the final declaration but made 
no public concessions to entreaties by other presidents for democratic and 
market reforms in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless such reforms are made, several presidents warned, Cuba will be left by 
the wayside as other Latin American countries wing their way toward hemispheric 
unity. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, and even though Castro's nemesis to the north often was 
mistrusted and resented by other Latin Americans in the past, most governments 
of the region are now eager to include the United States in their integration 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hope to start negotiating with Washington on trade agreements similar to 
Mexico's with NAFTA, and almost all are looking forward to a hemispheric summit 
meeting scheduled by President Clinton for December in Miami.

COMPROMISE HEALTH PLAN UNVEILED BUT WITHOUT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE; LEGISLATION: 
BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS FOCUSES ON AFFORDABILITY AND SLOWER PATH TO 
COVERING ALL AMERICANS. IT'S SEEN AS A SETBACK FOR CLINTON. 
</P>

<P>
 A bipartisan group of senators on the Finance Committee Friday unveiled the 
fruits of a closely watched attempt to produce a compromise health care plan 
but, despite weeks of effort, the proposal failed to reach President Clinton's 
bottom-line goal of guaranteed coverage for every American. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been created unrealistic expectations of what can be achieved," 
Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), leader of the group, said in defending the new 
proposal. "This compromise sends a clear message to the American people that we 
will not allow health care reform to be jeopardized by extremists from either 
party." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the five congressional committees charged with producing health 
legislation, the Finance Committee has been viewed as the most crucial 
battleground for Clinton's effort to overhaul the health care system, in part 
because the committee's membership closely reflects the range of opinions on 
the difficult issue that exist in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 And the moderates' failure to bridge the gap between Clinton and his opponents 
represented at least a temporary setback for the Administration. Still, 
although few expect the Chafee formulation to become law, it could prove 
crucial in moving the process along. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, only the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee has managed to 
produce a bill for consideration by the full Senate -- and its measure is 
widely considered to be far too liberal to win approval. That has increased the 
pressure on the Finance Committee's moderates to find more acceptable middle 
ground or risk losing any chance for significant reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The President emphasized in speeches this week that he is sticking to his 
promise to veto any legislation that does not guarantee coverage for the 39 
million people -- about 15% of the population -- who now lack it. 
</P>
<P>
 And Senate supporters of the Clinton plan had insisted that they could accept 
the moderates' plan only if it guaranteed universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, however, some Clinton allies on the Finance Committee shifted their 
ground slightly, saying that they might vote for the proposal even without the 
guarantee -- as a means of getting the issue to the Senate floor and avoiding 
the embarrassment of failing to produce a committee bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will vote for it in committee with the expectation that we will have 
opportunities to strengthen it on the floor," said Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), 
one of the leading backers of the Administration plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finance Committee had been scheduled to begin drafting a bill on Monday 
but announced Friday evening that it would delay meeting in public until later 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans allied with Chafee had 
been meeting feverishly in recent days, hoping to produce a plan that could 
both meet Clinton's universal coverage test and claim significant support from 
both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Their initial strategy for achieving universal coverage was a so-called 
"individual mandate" -- a requirement that uninsured workers be required to buy 
health insurance, much the way car owners must buy accident insurance under 
some state laws. The individual mandate was to kick in only if voluntary 
efforts failed at expanding coverage to 95% of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The senators hoped that approach would be an acceptable alternative to 
Clinton's proposal for requiring employers to pay 80% of the cost of their 
workers' health coverage. Clinton's employer mandate has drawn intense 
opposition from business, which contends that the additional costs would force 
smaller and weaker firms to lay off workers or shut down altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The senators' plan for an individual mandate was attacked from both the left 
and the right and ultimately they decided against proposing any requirements on 
employers or their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they suggested an intricate series of reforms aimed at making health 
coverage more affordable and thus more nearly universal. 
</P>
<P>
 Those earning up to 240% of the poverty level -- which means about $33,000 for 
a family of four -- would be eligible for government subsidies to help them 
purchase health insurance. To help pay for the subsidies and to hold premium 
costs down, the senators proposed taxing insurance plans that are among the 
most expensive in their regions. 
</P>
<P>
 If by the year 2002, less than 95% of the population was covered, a commission 
would make recommendations for reaching universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) said that the gradual approach had the advantage 
of assuring that "we were doing it right. . . . Congress will know a great deal 
more in the year 2002 than we do now." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal's sponsors estimated that the voluntary measures alone would 
succeed in covering about two-thirds of those who now lack health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the closest we're going to come to doing health care reform right," 
said Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.), one of the moderates, adding a plea: 
"Give the mainstream plan a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 However, reaction was less than enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the original eight members of the bipartisan group -- Democratic Sens. 
Max Baucus of Montana and Bill Bradley of New Jersey -- distanced themselves 
from the proposal. Baucus dropped out of the group entirely and Bradley issued 
a statement expressing regret that "this proposal did not do more to achieve 
universal coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), also a member of the Finance 
Committee, said that the proposal "gives us another option to consider and may 
have elements that will be helpful to the debate."

JAPANESE PREMIER FACES VOTE OF NO-CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's efforts to lure the Socialist Party back into 
his minority coalition ran into a wall Friday, raising the likelihood that he 
will be forced to dissolve the lower house of Parliament and call a general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower house's steering committee first scheduled a session for early today 
to vote on a no-confidence motion submitted Thursday by members of the Liberal 
Democratic Party, whose 38-year rule ended last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3 a.m. Friday, however, the committee rescheduled the session for noon 
today, and it was still uncertain that the vote would be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata could preempt it by resigning, by dissolving the lower house or by an 
eleventh-hour, surprise compromise with the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's chief strategist, emerged from a 10 1/2-hour 
meeting with Hata at 3:30 a.m. to say that consultations with the Socialists 
"are not over yet." He refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Socialists stunned Hata, who only the day before had offered to 
appease them by going through what he believed would be a ritual resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wataru Kubo, the Socialists' secretary general, declared that his party 
would not support Hata again in a lower house vote that would have to be 
conducted after the prime minister stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a month, pledging to support Hata's reelection, Kubo had made 
Hata's "voluntary" resignation a face-saving prerequisite for the party's 
return to the coalition it bolted eight weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa immediately withdrew the offer for Hata to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Another meeting between Ozawa and Kubo was scheduled to allow the prime 
minister's chief strategist to work out with Hata the coalition's final reply 
to the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Socialists' surprise demand for Hata's departure, Kubo made no 
suggestion as to who should replace him as premier. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata supporters unofficially proposed a "grand conservative alliance" that 
would give the Liberal Democrats a slice of the power they lost 11 months ago. 
But with its no-confidence motion pending, the party rejected the bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, suggested they would be willing to support 
Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama as prime minister, with their own leader, 
Yohei Kono, as vice premier in a coalition between the two parties that have 
been at each other's throats since 1955, when both came into existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the offer was sincere or merely an attempt to thwart the Socialists' 
reunion with the coalition was unclear. No Socialist has been touted as a prime 
minister since 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the party gradually has shed its Marxist ideology and advocacy 
of a socialist economy. But it still maintains friendly relations with 
Communist North Korea, advocates strong government subsidies for welfare and 
favors reducing defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Its opposition to an opening of Japan's rice market and its refusal to support 
an increase in a 3% consumption tax plagued former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa during his eight months in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve hours after they joined in electing Hata prime minister on April 25, 
Socialists bolted his government, leaving the coalition with only 37% of the 
seats in the lower house. Only the necessity to enact Japan's 1994 budget -- 
which passed the upper house Thursday -- forestalled a challenge to Hata at 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Socialists and the Liberal Democrats have condemned what they call 
"arbitrary, high-handed" decision-making by Ozawa. But they are united on few, 
if any, other policies.

HAITI MILITARY PLANS TO LOBBY IN U.S.; CARIBBEAN: LT. GEN. CEDRAS REPORTEDLY 
OBTAINED $500,000 FROM THE CENTRAL BANK AT A FAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE FOR 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST RETURN OF ARISTIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the military strongman here, recently obtained $500,000 
from the Central Bank at a highly favorable exchange rate to finance a lobbying 
and publicity campaign in the United States against the return of President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haitian political and financial experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is seen as a sign of his financial independence and his determination 
to stay in power, Cedras -- a leader of the September, 1991, military overthrow 
of Aristide -- brought 500,000 Haitian dollars to the bank late last week and 
drew $500,000 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 The normal exchange rate, however, is $3 Haitian for $1 U.S., meaning Cedras 
-- if involved in a routine swap -- should have received about $167,000 U.S. 
from the bank, which is so close to being broke that it has been unable to 
regularly pay government workers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sign of just how severe the dollar shortage is here, private donors had 
to raise $300,000 so Haitian television could pay to broadcast the World Cup 
soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans Paul, the pro-Aristide mayor of Port-au-Prince, said he had been told 
that the money will go to American lobbyists, politicians and journalists to 
campaign against the return of Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Other business sources confirmed the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 One said of the money's planned use: Military leaders "already are portraying 
Aristide as a traitor who is promoting American military intervention. What 
they want to do now is get their allies in the United States to renew the 
campaign to show Aristide as unbalanced, untrustworthy, anti-democratic and not 
worth U.S. intervention. I think you will also begin to hear complaints (from 
anti-Aristide forces in the United States) that the embargo is only hurting the 
poor, while Aristide sits in Washington in comfort and criticizes American 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of U.S. efforts to turn up the pressure on the Haitian military 
regime, all passenger air service between the United States and Haiti was cut 
off Friday, causing jams in airports.  
</P>
<P>
 There were Haitians in New York and Miami who were flocking home, laden with 
food and other necessities and determined to wait out the deepening crisis at 
home.  
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in Haiti, there were foreigners and Haitians who were trying to flee 
the Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians and others can still fly on other routes on non-U.S. carriers -- 
especially Air France -- to get around the toughened U.S. sanctions, which also 
included Wednesday's blocking of all Haitian-held accounts in U.S. banks 
worldwide and the freezing of the assets of the Haitian elite in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the now almost-complete economic embargo against Haiti and a U.S. 
policy to restore Aristide, the Haitian military has received extensive and 
high-level support in the United States, including from prominent senators, 
journalists and political operatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the new U.S. ban on financial transactions presented no obstacle 
to Cedras, as he seeks to transfer his newly acquired funds to supporters in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cedras simply puts the money in an offshore account in a non-American bank 
and then moves the funds to the States," a finance expert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras raised the money from other military officers and some civilians who 
have developed close business relationships with the army since the coup, other 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows that the general and his friends have no intention of giving up," 
a Haitian political figure said. And a diplomat added, "If they were going to 
leave the country, they wouldn't be using (this money) for an anti-Aristide 
publicity campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 A financial expert with extensive government experience pointed to the 
experience of Jean-Claude Duvalier, the last of his family's dictatorial 
dynasty, who looted the Central Bank just before he fled the country in 
February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he knew he was going to have to leave," the expert said, "he drew 
millions from the treasury. He didn't trust banks and liked to have a stock of 
money on hand in case anything happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Another signal, according to the sources, was the source of Cedras' cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "He raised the money from other officers and his friends," one political 
source said. "That shows he doesn't need the elite, that he has access to all 
the money he needs without asking for help." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest U.S. sanctions are aimed at punishing the elite, in the hopes that 
would force them to demand the expulsion of Cedras and other ranking officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But one diplomat said members of the elite have probably already sheltered 
their assets. "Beyond that," he predicted, "Haitians won't blame the military 
-- and, if they do, they are afraid to challenge them. But they will blame the 
Americans."

NEW SOUTH AFRICA EMBRACES RICH TRADITIONS; CEREMONIAL PRAISE SINGERS, NATIVE 
HEALERS HAVE ROLES IN POST-APARTHEID CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like any good poet, Sithembile Mlanjeni says his inspiration comes from deep 
inside, surging up to fill his brain and voice with the rolling rhythm and 
kinetic cadence of Xhosa verse. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most bards, however, Mlanjeni performs barefoot and bare-chested. He 
waves a cow-tail whisk in one hand and a burl-topped club called a knobkerrie 
in the other. He wears a jackal skin cap, an intricate bead necklace and a 
gleaming smile. 
</P>
<P>
 And he doesn't recite his poetry so much as bellow it out, unscripted and 
unrehearsed, with the approximate volume of a jet engine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes from within me," he explained. "From my heart. From my ancestors. 
They tell me what to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly they tell him to sing the praises of Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 Mlanjeni is an imbongi , or traditional praise singer. And as befits Mandela's 
role as a chief of the Thembu tribe of Transkei, Mlanjeni has bawled the 
glories of the new president and his royal ancestors at most of Mandela's major 
ceremonies, from the opening of the new Parliament to Mandela's formal 
inauguration in Pretoria last month.  
</P>
<P>
 The troubadour's rap-like riffs and roars, and those of a deputy praise 
singer, drew open-mouthed stares at Mandela's swearing-in from a crowd that 
included Vice President Al Gore, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Cuban 
President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 Mlanjeni's presence is not the only sign that the new South Africa is 
embracing ancient African traditions as well as modern Western democracy as it 
seeks solutions for the legacy of poverty and injustice left by apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the young nation is writing its own rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the first weeklong session of the new, all-race Parliament adjourned 
last month, for example, the new members had created their own dress code. Gray 
suits gave way to African robes, Indian saris and Doc Marten shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some speeches began, "Comrades," or were uttered in the Zulu or Xhosa 
languages. One member refused to give his "maiden speech," saying the term was 
sexist. And members applauded one another for the first time, instead of 
muttering in British style, an event reported in the Citizen, a Johannesburg 
newspaper under the dramatic headline, "Clap in Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, a local Monopoly-style board game called Oppression that featured 
segregated jails and other vestiges of apartheid has been replaced by a game 
called Democracy. Players each control a political party and must deal with 
such vagaries of public life as an assassin, call girls and illegal dealing in 
rhinoceros horns. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes are more significant. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's government has proposed, for example, that traditional healers 
called sangomas be incorporated into an ambitious new health care plan to 
"become an integral and recognized part of health care in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ralph Mgijima, who helped draft the plan for the African National 
Congress, conceded that "there are obvious problems," chief among them such 
practices as ritual murder, the use of human organs and alleged witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said most sangomas are benign healers who provide medical and spiritual 
care to millions of impoverished rural blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We start from the premise that there are many areas where people have no 
access to health care except for sangomas and traditional healers," he said. 
"So to restructure health care, you have to include those people. They have the 
confidence of those communities and are leaders in their own right." 
</P>
<P>
 In urban areas, many black families use a doctor for sickness and a sangoma 
for problems such as depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Sangomas "have a much higher success rate in treating psychiatric illnesses 
and mental health problems than modern psychiatry," Mgijima said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sangomas say they communicate with ancestors. Isak Niehaus, an anthropologist 
at the University of the Witwatersrand, explained that in Western terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go to a sangoma , he helps you create a myth to reorder the chaotic 
experience in your life," he said. "If you go because you're depressed, and the 
sangoma says it's because your ancestor is unhappy, you believe it. And it 
gives you a course of action. And that is very valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 The new health minister, Dr. Nkosazana Zuma, wants legislation to register 
traditional healers, set standards for their training and care, and test the 
medicines they use. It won't be easy: Much of their practice remains a mystery. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Sangomas , for example, usually diagnose a patient's problem by "rolling the 
bones," or reading portents from a special set of animal bone shards. If 
medicine is required, they prepare it from roots and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment may include scarring skin with a razor, or scratching it with 
porcupine quills. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Solomon Mahlaba, a sangoma who heads the Traditional Medical 
Practitioners' Assn., estimated that there are 200,000 to 300,000 sangomas 
nationwide, saying that may include "diviners, herbalists and spiritual 
healers." It doesn't include those Mahlaba called "charlatans." 
</P>
<P>
 Sangomas and praise singers are common throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and have 
been for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 But like most of black culture, that heritage was ignored by South African 
whites during the dark era of racial oligarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer. Now others are singing Mlanjeni's praises. 
</P>
<P>
 He was enshrined last month, for example, in "Madame and Eve," South Africa's 
"Doonesbury." 
</P>
<P>
 In one memorable strip, a character named Marge is preceded by an imbongi who 
hollers, "Marge! She is great! Her ancestors are great! Viva Marge! Queen of 
the party animals!"  
</P>
<P>
 Ari Sitas, a sociologist at the University of Natal in Durban, said praise 
singers use "vibrant metaphoric power" to highlight the heroic exploits of a 
local chief and his ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very powerful form of communication," he said. "It's a tradition that 
goes back to the mists of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Mlanjeni, a stocky 33-year-old, got his start at age 13 when his high-decibel 
interpretation of a Xhosa poem in class had teachers asking for repeat 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 He later joined the police and became a bodyguard and praise singer for Gen. 
Bantu Holomisa, who was then president of the Transkei black homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to put on my traditional gear and sing praise," he recalled. "Then I'd 
take off my gear, pick up my rifle and be a bodyguard again." 
</P>
<P>
 As his fame spread, he performed at graduations, weddings and soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in February, 1990, he and Holomisa flew to Cape Town to hail Mandela's 
release from 27 years in prison. Because they were from the same Transkei 
hamlet, Qunu, Mlanjeni already knew Mandela's family history and Thembu tribal 
lore. He quickly offered his services. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a police lieutenant, Mlanjeni considers the inauguration the high point of 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
 He rendered umbongo , a style of poetic praise that combined Mandela's 
genealogy with a heavy dose of mythology. 
</P>
<P>
 Consonants and clicks cascaded off his tongue as he praised Mandela's parents 
and forefathers in a rich, resonant voice that rumbled from the stage and 
echoed down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to recount the praise in English, he said Mandela's rise "from prisoner 
to president" had "aroused from the graves" deceased leaders of Mandela's 
African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has changed his enemies to be friends, not to take revenge upon them but 
to collect them in the new South Africa, one nation, one South Africa, one 
president, one Mandela!" 
</P>
<P>
 After it was over, the new president smiled. "He said, 'Thank you very much. 
Now you have told the people who I am.' "

HAITI MILITARY TO FINANCE ANTI-ARISTIDE CAMPAIGN IN U.S., SOURCES SAY; 
CARIBBEAN: LT. GEN. CEDRAS OBTAINED $500,000 FROM THE CENTRAL BANK AT A 
FAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE. SOME SEE THE MOVE AS A SIGN HE IS DIGGING IN. 
</P>

<P>
 Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the military strongman here, recently obtained $500,000 
from the Central Bank at a highly favorable exchange rate to finance a lobbying 
and publicity campaign in the United States against the return of exiled 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haitian political and financial experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is seen as a sign of his financial independence and his determination 
to stay in power, Cedras -- a leader of the September, 1991, military overthrow 
of Aristide -- brought 500,000 Haitian dollars to the bank late last week and 
drew $500,000 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 The normal exchange rate, however, is $3 Haitian for $1 U.S., meaning Cedras 
-- if involved in a routine swap -- should have received about $167,000 U.S. 
from the bank, which is so close to being broke that it has been unable to 
regularly pay government workers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sign of just how severe the dollar shortage is here, private donors had 
to raise $300,000 so Haitian television could pay to broadcast the World Cup 
soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans Paul, the pro-Aristide mayor of Port-au-Prince, said he had been told 
that the money will go to American lobbyists, politicians and journalists to 
campaign against the return of Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Other business sources confirmed the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 One said of the money's planned use: Military leaders "already are portraying 
Aristide as a traitor who is promoting American military intervention. What 
they want to do now is get their allies in the United States to renew the 
campaign to show Aristide as unbalanced, untrustworthy, anti-democratic and not 
worth U.S. intervention. I think you will also begin to hear complaints (from 
anti-Aristide forces in the United States) that the embargo is only hurting the 
poor, while Aristide sits in Washington in comfort and criticizes American 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of U.S. efforts to turn up the pressure on the Haitian military 
regime, all passenger air service between the United States and Haiti was cut 
off Friday, causing jams in airports.  
</P>
<P>
 There were Haitians in New York and Miami who were flocking home, laden with 
food and other necessities and determined to wait out the deepening crisis at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in Haiti, there were foreigners and Haitians who were trying to flee 
the Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians and others can still fly on other routes on non-U.S. carriers -- 
especially Air France -- to get around the toughened U.S. sanctions, which also 
included Wednesday's blocking of all Haitian-held accounts in U.S. banks 
worldwide and the freezing of the assets of the Haitian elite in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the now almost-complete economic embargo against Haiti and a U.S. 
policy to restore Aristide, the Haitian military has received extensive and 
high-level support in the United States, including from prominent senators, 
journalists and political operatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the new U.S. ban on financial transactions presented no obstacle 
to Cedras, as he seeks to transfer his newly acquired funds to supporters in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cedras simply puts the money in an offshore account in a non-American bank 
and then moves the funds to the States," a finance expert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said the Cedras operation is evidence of several trends in the 
Haitian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras raised the money from other military officers and some civilians who 
have developed close business relationships with the army since the coup, other 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows that the general and his friends have no intention of giving up," 
a Haitian political figure said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were going to leave the country, they wouldn't be using (this money) 
for an anti-Aristide publicity campaign," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 A financial expert with extensive government experience pointed to the 
experience of Jean-Claude Duvalier, the last of his family's dictatorial 
dynasty, who looted the Central Bank just before he fled the country in 
February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he knew he was going to have to leave," the expert said, "he drew 
millions from the treasury. He didn't trust banks and liked to have a stock of 
money on hand in case anything happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Another signal, according to the sources, was the source of Cedras' cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "He raised the money from other officers and his friends," one political 
source said. "That shows he doesn't need the elite, that he has access to all 
the money he needs without asking for help." 
</P>
<P>
 The source was making the point that, until recently, the military was largely 
at the mercy -- financially and politically -- of Haiti's wealthy elite, 
particularly the six richest families, who could direct the armed forces in 
their policies and actions. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the coup, said one diplomat, Cedras and his friends "have become 
independently wealthy -- and I stress independently. That is why the (American) 
policy of trying to get the elite to put pressure on the military hasn't worked 
and won't work now." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to the latest Clinton Administration sanctions aimed at 
punishing the elite, in the hopes that would force them to demand the expulsion 
of Cedras and other ranking officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, (they) . . . the Mevs and the Brandts (two prominent families) 
and the others have had enough warning to have moved most of their money and 
other assets to safe havens. Beyond that, Haitians won't blame the military, 
and, if they do, they are afraid to challenge them. But they will blame the 
Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 A leading anti-military business figure supported that view, saying: "All of 
the phone calls I've received are saying, 'What are your American friends 
doing, trying to kill us?' I tell them they have to take responsibility on 
themselves and go to the military, but all they say is that it's the Americans' 
fault and they have to fix it."

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON'S TALKING MUDDLES POLICY; FOREIGN AFFAIRS: MANY THINK HE 
WOULD BE MORE PERSUASIVE IF HE RESERVED COMMENT UNTIL HE MADE UP HIS MIND WHAT 
TO DO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Late last month, in the aftermath of yet another Administration foreign policy 
embarrassment -- the abrupt reversal over linking trade with China to human 
rights improvements there -- President Clinton said there was nothing wrong 
with his foreign policy that better communication could not solve. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged in a recent interview with The Times that his inability 
to articulate his Administration's foreign policy goals "is not inspiring 
people's confidence in me." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that, if he were better able to communicate his goals, Americans would 
be more comfortable with his policies. 
</P>
<P>
 So in recent weeks, the White House has hired a new foreign policy spokesman, 
begun regular high-level communications strategy meetings and put the President 
on display more often to demonstrate his grasp of foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Clinton may believe that failure to communicate is at fault, others 
see a more troubling problem -- the tendency to communicate more while having 
less to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's new expansiveness has exposed the sometimes tortuous path that his 
thinking takes to arrive at foreign policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many outside observers -- and some senior White House aides -- believe that 
Clinton would be more persuasive if he would reserve comment on foreign affairs 
until after he has made up his mind what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent attempts to improve the presentation of Administration policy, 
the dispute with North Korea has been marked by crossed signals, mixed 
messages, empty threats and the unusual spectacle of a current and a former 
President at odds over U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance is reminiscent of earlier foreign policy troubles -- in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, Haiti and China -- in which Clinton and his 
advisers talked tough but did not follow through with forceful action. 
</P>
<P>
 As he did with Bosnia last year, Clinton talked about putting together an 
international coalition to punish North Korea before he had done the groundwork 
with U.S. allies. Both attempts at concerted international action failed. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides, concerned that Clinton had not clearly spelled out U.S. 
interests in Korea and the Administration's policy for dealing with North 
Korea's nuclear ambitions, persuaded the President to disrupt his schedule and 
make an unplanned appearance in the White House briefing room last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton gave a rather long talk on why Americans should care about what 
happens in Korea and explained that he was trying to put together an 
international coalition to thwart North Korea's efforts to produce nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But within a day, his effort to rally U.S. allies to impose sanctions against 
North Korea was undercut by former President Jimmy Carter's statement that 
sanctions would be counterproductive and should not be part of U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton appeared in the briefing room again Wednesday to announce the "good 
news" that North Korea had agreed to freeze its nuclear programs while 
Washington and Pyongyang engage in high-level talks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President acknowledged that North Korea may not be sincere and said he 
would reassess U.S. policy again if Pyongyang reneges on its promises to open 
its nuclear facilities to inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to Clinton's communications difficulties lies not in more talk from 
the President and his advisers -- which tends to confuse and alarm the public 
-- but less, according to former White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is . . . every time he tries to show people he knows the subject, 
he defeats his own purpose," said Fitzwater, who was spokesman for Presidents 
George Bush and Ronald Reagan. "He should know enough to be careful not to say 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the crisis of the day is in Pyongyang or Sarajevo or Kigali, the 
President should explain U.S. interests in easily understood form and refrain 
from musing aloud about complex, fast-changing international crises, Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the absence of policy, too often your communications are swept up in 
response to questions and they always relate to action and threats," he said. 
"All we've seen is either (Vice President Al) Gore or the President making 
threats of one kind or another. My advice to them would be to settle on two or 
three brief points that make a case for our policy and, whatever the question, 
repeat those points and reassure the public (that) they are staying on top of 
the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Following Fitzwater's advice might have spared Clinton embarrassment over the 
last year as he has been forced to retreat from threats and evolving policies 
around the globe: 
</P>
<P>
 * Had Clinton not promised vociferously to revoke China's most-favored-nation 
trading privileges if Beijing did not improve its human rights record, he would 
not have had to back down a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 * If he had not threatened Haiti's coup leaders with military action, he would 
not have had to face the ignominy of weeks of inaction while the Haitian 
generals consolidated their power and did great harm to their enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 * If he had not noisily brandished the sanctions weapon against North Korea 
and hinted at the possibility of war on the Korean peninsula, he would not have 
had to explain how Carter's visit to Pyongyang could produce "hopeful signs" 
that the crisis might be ended quickly and peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior White House official said Clinton aides understood from the 
beginning of his presidential campaign that Clinton's habit of thinking aloud 
would be a major challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hoped at first that all of you, the press and Washington in general, would 
adapt to his style and understand that he likes to try out ideas in public," 
the official said. "But we got over that hope pretty quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, the official added, was that, although Clinton understands -- in 
theory -- the dangers of thinking aloud, he cannot stop himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The same malady afflicted former Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who brought to 
the Administration ruminative habits developed over years in Congress, where he 
had less of an impact on the United States' image abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Other White House aides argued that the problem is not an excess of words and 
a dearth of experience but rather the ambiguous nature of the post-Cold War 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has been buffeted by crises that do not lend themselves to simple 
black-and-white analysis and us-versus-them rhetoric, White House 
Communications Director Mark Gearan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult time we're living in. The global map is much more 
complicated now than it was in the days that there was us and the Soviet 
Union," Gearan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that instant global communications make the President's job much 
tougher as well, citing Carter's mission to North Korea as an example. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for instant news and analysis preempts the careful consultation and 
coordination required to present a cogent explanation of Administration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Without saying so, Gearan suggested that Carter should have walked away from 
the CNN microphones in Pyongyang and called the White House to coordinate his 
statements before openly contradicting Administration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearan then cited another example of how the velocity of news coverage makes 
his job of coordinating Administration communications virtually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Pentagon launched cruise missiles against Iraq's intelligence 
headquarters in Baghdad just as CNN's political commentary show "The Capital 
Gang" was airing live. 
</P>
<P>
 As the talk show participants were debating the effect of the military raid on 
the Administration, Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, was on the 
phone to Gen. Colin L. Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
trying to determine where the missiles were landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know if they were falling on downtown Baghdad or downtown Boston, 
and they're already dissecting the impact on the Clinton presidency," Gearan 
complained, adding: "Conducting diplomacy in the age of instant communications 
is a very different proposition. Without wanting to sound like I'm whining, 
it's unprecedented."

SKELETONS OF 30 MONKS, BABY FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The skeletons of 30 medieval monks have been uncovered during building work to 
extend London's underground rail system, archeologists said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The graves were found on the site of an ancient monastery, St Mary's Abbey. 
All contained male adults, except for one 18-month-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "The baby was quite a surprise, but we will never know why it was buried with 
the monks," said Pat Wilkinson, an archeologist. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not yet been decided if the bones will be reburied or put in a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologists have until July 5 to complete the excavations before the site is 
permanently destroyed by construction work. The abbey was founded in 1135, but 
the graves date from the 15th Century.

CLINTON CHOICE FOR KEY NAVAL POST WITHDRAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Navy has withdrawn President Clinton's choice for Pacific commander in the 
wake of criticism over the admiral's handling of a sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued Friday said Adm.Stanley R. Arthur "regrets that the 
anticipated delay in Senate confirmation of his nomination to be Commander in 
Chief, U.S. Pacific Command, has the potential to create a gap in that key 
billet." 
</P>
<P>
 The assignment to the Pacific command would have given Arthur overall control 
of U.S. military operations in Korea. A Pentagon official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said Arthur was being forced to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur, 59, is now the vice chief of naval operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) had threatened to place a hold on Arthur's 
required Senate confirmation because of a sexual harassment case that involved 
a Navy officer from Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Rebecca Hansen, 28, filed a sexual harassment complaint last year against 
her instructor during helicopter flight training in Corpus Christi, Tex. The 
officer was disciplined and later left the Navy. But in the meantime, Hansen 
was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. She later flunked at the Navy 
helicopter pilot school. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur reviewed the failing grade and decided last April to confirm the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Durenberger did not object to Arthur's decision but was not satisfied with the 
Navy's response to his questions about why Hansen had been put through 
psychiatric evaluation, an aide said. Durenberger also was concerned that the 
Navy had not adequately explored the possibility that Hansen's failing grade 
was tied to her filing a sexual harassment complaint.

RUSSIA, EUROPE SIGN KEY TRADE PACT; COMMERCE: THE AGREEMENT LIFTS MOST EUROPEAN 
BARRIERS TO RUSSIAN EXPORTS AND SETS TALKS ON A FREE-TRADE ZONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and European Union leaders on Friday 
clinched a trade agreement so overarching that Yeltsin proclaimed it a historic 
step toward uniting Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, signed on the Greek island of Corfu and acclaimed in Russia as 
the end of economic isolation from Europe, lifts most European barriers to 
Russian exports and sets talks beginning in 1998 on a Europe-Russia free-trade 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represents a decisive step toward restoring the unity of our continent," 
Yeltsin said of the agreement, and the accord "will bring Russia back into 
economic Europe as an equal partner." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming just two days after Russia joined NATO's "Partnership for Peace" 
program and coinciding with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin's visit to 
the United States, the pact appeared to signal a new Russian push toward the 
West -- a shift from Moscow's recent efforts to assert its independence in 
diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alexander Konovalov, a senior analyst at Moscow's prestigious USA-Canada 
Institute, said the timing was a mere coincidence -- and the 10-year agreement 
with the European Union was simply too good to put off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have coordinated -- and agreed upon -- market shares for a number of 
export goods," Konovalov added. "That is good and normal because what we have 
been trying to do until now was to break into Western markets with our dumping 
prices, for which we have been justifiably pushed out collectively as some kind 
of troublemaker. Now, Russia can start seriously thinking about some 
cooperation and division of labor with its European partners." 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow media estimates that trade barriers have cost Russia about $3 billion a 
year in lost exports to Europe, its biggest trading partner outside the former 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin has often argued, particularly with Washington, that Russia needs free 
access to Western markets more than it needs billions of dollars in aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Friday's agreement, some barriers to Russian exports will remain on 
uranium, steel and textiles. But the basic idea is that Russia and the 12 
European Union members exchange most-favored-nation trade status. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is also meant to encourage European injections of money into 
Russia's crisis-ridden economy by making it easier to get profits out of the 
country and allowing freer investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia exports mainly raw materials to Europe, including minerals, metals and 
wood, and imports largely machinery, processed food and vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow appeared particularly happy that the EU -- unlike the United States -- 
recognized that the Russian economy is no longer state-run but rather is "in 
transition" to a market-driven system, meaning that Europe needed less defense 
against the possible dumping of cheap, state-owned goods. 
</P>
<P>
 After almost two years of wrangling over the accord, Russia also managed to 
retain the right to keep up some import barriers to protect threatened domestic 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Its main concessions included an agreement to allow many more foreign banks to 
operate in Russia beginning in 1996 and to accept French-backed limitations on 
its uranium exports. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord strengthened political ties with a plan for Russian and European 
leaders to meet twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian and European parliaments must still ratify the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 That will be far from automatic given the strong ultranationalist faction in 
the Russian Duma, where little opposition has been voiced so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Russian accord, the EU on Friday finalized its acceptance of 
four new members -- Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden -- as of January. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumblings also continued over who would become the next head of the EU's 
executive agency, replacing France's Jacques Delors. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene has the backing of France and Germany, 
but there are also candidates from Britain and Holland. The battle for 
leadership, expected to continue today, threatened to throw a pall on the 
meeting after the Russian dose of sweetness and light. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sticky moment came when Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 
whose government includes members who call themselves "post-fascists," was 
roundly snubbed by one of his Greek hosts at the door to the Church of St. 
George, where the summit and signing took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin, however, appeared to be having a grand time, staying on the yacht of 
Greek magnate Yannis Latsis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Itar-Tass news agency reported that the Russian president, who has denied 
serious health problems but frequently appears fatigued, would stay on for a 
few days of rest on Corfu.

<P>
 In a huge political upset, a dour young corruption fighter who favors closer 
ties with Russia was on the brink Friday of winning an election and becoming 
this tiny country's first president. 
</P>
<P>
 According to preliminary returns, Alexander G. Lukashenko, at 39 the youngest 
of six candidates, earned 45.1% of the vote in this sleepy, Utah-sized corner 
of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Vyacheslav F. Kebich, the 58-year-old prime minister and odds-on favorite, 
came in a distant second with 17.4%, despite backing from the government-owned 
press and predictions that he would do far better. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Lukashenko failed to win a majority, he and Kebich will compete in a 
runoff election sometime in the next two weeks. Lukashenko is expected to win 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
 As a deputy to the Supreme Soviet, the Belarus legislature, Lukashenko rose to 
national fame by accusing 70 government officials -- including Kebich and 
another candidate for president, Stanislav S. Shushkevich -- of stealing 
government money. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview a few days before the election, Lukashenko said his first 
priority would be continuing the battle against corruption, or, as he put it, 
"healing our syphilitic society." 
</P>
<P>
 That battle, he said, had already put his life in danger: He told voters that 
his family was in hiding, while he himself was forced to switch cars three or 
four times a day to throw off would-be assailants. Last week, he said a 
drive-by assassin had shot at him but missed. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused Kebich of trying to kill him. Police authorities and government-run 
television dismissed those claims as an attention-getting hoax. Kebich called 
him a drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 On the campaign trail, Lukashenko spoke only Russian -- which is similar to 
Belarussian and is universally understood here -- as a matter of principle. 
</P>
<P>
 He also favored a treaty with Moscow to readopt the Russian ruble as the 
official currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Belarus already has a currency, the Belarus ruble -- known locally as the 
rabbit, because the baby-blue one-ruble note sports a smiling hare. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has gone into a tailspin. In U.S. dollar terms, the rabbit today is 
worth a quarter of what it was three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the monetary union treaty, Belarussians could trade weakening rabbits 
for stronger Russian rubles. But the deal -- worked out between Kebich and 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin -- would give Moscow control of 
Belarus monetary policy. Critics say it trades Belarus' economic sovereignty 
for short-term gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukashenko, a thin-faced, gravel-voiced collective farm chief, told voters 
that Moscow would rather sign that treaty with him than with Kebich. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main idea of my campaign is 'new people,' " he said. "In Moscow, they 
don't want to even speak with old people like Kebich or Shushkevich." 
</P>
<P>
 He also pledged not to "force (privatization) upon voters" and reassured them 
that "I'm not an economist on the macro level, but on the micro level -- the 
level of people who work on the farms and at the factories." 
</P>
<P>
 Zenon S. Poznyak and Shushkevich -- independence-minded candidates who oppose 
the monetary union treaty and support fast-track economic reforms -- came in 
third and fourth. Poznyak got 12.9% of the vote, Shushkevich 9.9%. Turnout was 
78.9% overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Kebich and his government-run press fought an ugly campaign, accusing Poznyak 
and Shushkevich of wanting to stir tensions between the country's 8 million 
Belarussians and 1.3 million Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 Kebich's claim that the election of either Poznyak or Shushkevich would mean 
civil war -- strange-sounding rhetoric in this drowsy former Soviet republic -- 
was taken to heart by voters, who are frightened by the conflicts they see in 
neighboring Ukraine and Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
 But his attacks on Lukashenko seem to have backfired. 
</P>
<P>
 Government television reached a banal low earlier this week, broadcasting an 
interview with an Aeroflot flight attendant who -- apparently reading a cue 
card -- accused Lukashenko of eating chocolates that had been in her purse (and 
leaving the wrappers behind) on a flight two years ago.

FRENCH TROOPS GUARD TUTSI REFUGEE CAMP IN RWANDA; MASS GRAVES FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 French troops pushing deeper into western Rwanda reported finding mass graves 
Friday, the second day of their mercy mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The French are offering protection to refugees from the ethnic slaughter that 
has convulsed this central African nation for more than two months.More French 
troops joined the mission Friday, crossing over from bases in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to ease the suspicions of Rwanda's predominantly Tutsi rebel movement, 
French commanders made their first objective the refugee camp at Nyarushishi, 
where 8,000 Tutsis have been menaced by fanatical Hutu militias. About 50 
commandos were on guard Friday, a day after moving in from Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front do not trust France because it 
intervened to prevent a rebel assault on the Hutu-dominated government four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, rebel officers repeated Friday that their fighters will not try to 
confront French troops if they stay in the government-controlled west. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Raymond Germanos, assistant chief of staff, told reporters in Paris that 
patrols checking towns along Lake Kivu on the western fringe of Rwanda found 
several mass graves. He said there was no immediate word on the number of 
victims or their ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 He said French soldiers saw "youths carrying knives and sticks," but the 
groups showed no hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 France insists that it is not taking sides in the civil war this time and 
wants only to prevent more massacres, which U.N. officials estimate have killed 
hundreds of thousands of civilians, most of them minority Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 With the approval of the U.N. Security Council, the French government plans to 
put about 2,500 soldiers and marines in Rwanda for two months until an 
all-African U.N. peacekeeping force twice that size arrives.

<P>
 Seventeen years ago, huge sums of development money pouring into Sudan were 
going to transform this vast land into a breadbasket for the Middle East. A 
conciliatory Sudanese president was in the process of forging a lasting peace 
with the rebellious south. A Sudanese union with Egypt was to ensure that 
moderate Arabs controlled the Nile. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of that happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Sudan instead finds itself cut adrift by old Western and Arab friends, 
a renegade that last August was placed on the U.S. State Department's list of 
nations supporting international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 The $800 million that once gushed into Sudan from the Middle East, Japan and 
the West -- and made up 55% of the national budget -- has dried to a trickle 
(maybe $50 million), and the Sudanese are left to ponder if all that has gone 
wrong can perhaps be righted by the fundamental Islamic course their government 
now follows. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudan has fought a civil war for 28 of its 38 years of independence from 
Britain and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 In those 38 years, it has had 30 governments. Sudan has trod every conceivable 
political path: Marxism, socialism, democracy, military dictatorship and now a 
populist style of Islamic fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 It has at various times made alliances with the West, the Communist bloc, the 
moderate Arabs, the radical Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything has failed. Year after year Sudan -- Africa's largest country, a 
quarter the size of the U.S. mainland -- has slipped further backward 
politically and economically. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with inflation running about 200% annually, Khartoum's furnace-like heat, 
swirling desert dust and sense of futility seem to have hammered the Sudanese 
into a somnolent state of lethargy. Islam has become the last refuge for a 
people captive to quiet desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 The young, disfranchised men who have flocked to Islam are the same ones who 
20 years ago in Africa would have become Communists. For them, the marriage of 
politics and religion finds expression as a form of nationalism that views as 
irrelevant -- or untrue -- charges that their government harbors terrorists, 
violates human rights and wants to impose Islam on the Christian and pagan 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 Both publicly and privately, government officials deny the existence of "ghost 
houses" -- little security offices tucked away in Khartoum's labyrinth of dirt 
streets where Amnesty International has chronicled, by victims' names and 
dates, a constant pattern of human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do they acknowledge any link to terrorism or any presence of terrorists, 
contending that such charges are fabrications of American policy-makers intent 
on thwarting the spread of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's simply not true," said Donald Petterson, the U.S. ambassador, who has 
spent most of his 30-year diplomatic career in Africa. "Hamas, Hezbollah, 
Islamic Jihad, Abu Nidal -- these (extremist) organizations have offices here, 
and there is a relationship between them and elements of the government that is 
undeniable. We also have credible information that activities such as the 
training of terrorists go on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Petterson -- the West's point man in attempts to bring Sudan's behavior more 
into line with accepted international practices -- also said the U.S. Embassy 
has documented evidence of detention, torture and summary executions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government's standard reply when I bring up human rights," he said, "is, 
'That's a pack of lies.' To which I say, baloney." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has not publicly linked Sudan with any specific act of 
terrorism, as it has Libya, but few Sudanese outside the government refute the 
assessment of one non-American diplomat: "This is a place that welcomes people 
no one else wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Petterson said firm evidence of Sudan's involvement in terrorism came to light 
last summer from sensitive sources he will not discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 To travel in Sudan today is to return to the Africa of a generation ago. The 
security apparatus is pervasive, and people choose their words carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything appears to be in an accelerated state of decay. Mounds of paperwork 
-- usually in triplicate with no carbon paper provided -- are required for the 
simplest task. Checking into a hotel, for example, visitors must provide a 
photograph and fill out a form that will be sent to the government for 
inspection. Multi-party democracy is not even in the national vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 While much of Africa has become more relaxed and democratic in the 1990s, 
Sudan seems caught in a time warp, its development retarded by ethnic discord 
-- the 26 million Sudanese speak 100 languages and the Arab north is at war 
with the African south -- by former President Jaafar Numeiri's neglect of the 
economy and infrastructure, by an absence of foreign investors who once packed 
the Khartoum Hilton but would now find a mostly empty hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Numeiri was a conciliator who made peace with his political enemies and a 
treaty with the embattled south. But in 1983, needing a new alliance, he 
reached out to the Muslim Brotherhood, became devout and made the Sharia 
(Islamic law) the law of the land, even in the non-Muslim south. The 
partnership bought him an additional two years of power, until 1985, when he 
was overthrown in the only African coup ever led by the middle and professional 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadek Mahdi, Numeiri's democratically elected successor, was toppled in 1989, 
bringing to power the current military regime of President Omar Hassan Ahmed 
Bashir. 
</P>
<P>
 His is not a government of wild-eyed mullahs. Many of his subordinates are 
articulate, Western-educated, dedicated to making the country work and as 
gracious as the Sudanese people themselves. In private they do not speak 
piously, and they are candid about the country's immense problems and the 
government's inability to solve them. 
</P>
<P>
 But all indications are that Bashir is free to govern only as long as his 
policies do not run counter to the aims of the National Islamic Front. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly espousing tolerance and moderation, the NIF has taken control of key 
ministries, crippled trade unions, purged the military of non-Muslim commanders 
and orchestrated Sudan's increasingly rigid observance of Islamic dictates: All 
women are veiled and, as passengers, segregated in the rear of buses. Anyone 
caught drinking alcohol is flogged. Zakat, the Islamic tax for charity, is 
mandatory (a man who owns 40 camels is taxed one camel a year). 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of the NIF, Hassan Turabi, a soft-spoken, erudite, 
Sorbonne-educated sheik, is widely seen as an architect of the Islamic revival 
that has spread from Algeria to Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not a junior partner to Iran, Sudan watchers say, and the Islam he 
espouses contains large doses of capitalism, an emphasis on nationalism and 
considerable equality of women (who are allowed to serve in the militia and 
work side by side with men). 
</P>
<P>
 Though Iran views Sudan as a useful avenue into Africa, particularly 
neighboring Egypt, Turabi and Bashir's positions are frequently at odds with 
those of Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudan, for instance, was critical of the allied coalition in the Persian Gulf 
War -- and of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudan has not denounced the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, saying it is 
up to the Palestinians to decide what is best for them. And in public 
statements it has been decidedly conciliatory to Washington lately, referring 
to the United States in the government-controlled press as a "friendly" country 
and welcoming the recent arrival in Khartoum of Ambassador Melissa Wells, 
President Clinton's special envoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, however, has been clear that relations will not improve until 
Khartoum cleanses its human rights record and severs terrorist links. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the terms for repaired relations that would enable Ambassador 
Petterson to forsake his bodyguards and armored vehicle have fallen on deaf 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually all this will work out," a senior official said, expressing a view 
that does not square with reality. "I think we're already seeing a softening in 
the White House's position. They're starting to realize the importance the 
Sudan has to the West." 
</P>
<P>
 In the barren offices outside his door, cobwebs clung to the ceiling corners, 
and a legion of government workers sat at empty desks. Why, the man was asked, 
is Sudan important to the West? He sipped his tea, thought awhile and did not 
answer.

U.S. CALLS FOR HALT OF YEMEN BOMBARDMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Northern forces continued to rain artillery shells and rockets Friday on Aden, 
capital of Yemen's breakaway south, and the United States called on the north 
to cease the deadly bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the State Department voiced alarm over the shelling of Aden and 
said there were heavy casualties.It said the attacks violate a U.N. Security 
Council resolution for a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The south said Thursday that more than 800 civilians had been killed or 
wounded since Sunday in Aden. Aden radio quoted unidentified southern Defense 
Ministry sources as saying battles continued Friday around the port city, which 
has been besieged by northern forces for most of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern forces in the country's 1 1/2-month-old civil war claimed to have 
inflicted hundreds of casualties on the northerners as well.

SETTLER ACTED ALONE IN MASSACRE, ISRAELI PANEL REPORTEDLY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An inquiry commission found that Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein acted alone 
when he killed Muslim worshipers in February's Hebron mosque massacre, Israeli 
newspapers reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony by Palestinian witnesses and some Israeli army guards had suggested 
that there was a second gunman or that Goldstein had an accomplice in the Feb. 
25 blood bath at the Cave of the Patriarchs.At least 30 Muslim worshipers died 
and scores were wounded at a site sacred to Muslims and Jews before the crowd 
killed Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-member commission of three judges, a professor and a retired general 
is to publish its findings Sunday, but the contents of the report have already 
been leaked extensively. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is not seeking criminal indictments, but criticized senior army 
officers for ignoring intelligence warnings about possible violence by Jewish 
extremists against Palestinians, the Yediot Aharonot and Haaretz newspapers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also found that law enforcement against Jewish settlers in the 
occupied lands has been too lax, the dailies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who also testified before the panel, shouldered 
some of the blame. As defense minister, Rabin is directly responsible for the 
occupied lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steps that were taken were not sufficient, including by groups that I am in 
charge of," Rabin said in remarks published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other findings, the commission said soldiers did not fire on worshipers 
fleeing the massacre site and did not intentionally block the evacuation of 
wounded.

MEXICAN BANKER'S FAMILY AGREES TO PAY RANSOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only minutes before a deadline, the family of one of Mexico's richest men went 
on nationwide television and agreed to pay a huge ransom to free him from 
kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement on the television program "24 Hours" -- as demanded by the 
kidnapers -- came just before the 11:30 p.m. Thursday deadline they had set to 
kill Alfredo Harp Helu, 50, president of Mexico's largest financial company. He 
was kidnaped March 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that soon now he will be home with us," his eldest son, Alfredo Harp 
Calderoni, told the show's host, Jacobo Jabludovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping of Harp Helu, listed as a billionaire in a 1993 Forbes magazine 
survey, was the most spectacular in a wave of kidnapings in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's representatives said the ransom would fall short of the $30 
million demanded June 23, but did not give a precise figure. In a letter on 
April 25, the kidnapers had demanded $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Harp Calderoni said the method of payment had not been worked out. He said his 
father should be freed 72 hours after the details were agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Harp Helu is a leading member of the group that purchased Banco Nacional de 
Mexico from the government in 1991. The group combined it with the Accival 
stock brokerage company to form Grupo Banamex-Accival. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a cousin of Carlos Slim, who heads the recently privatized Telefonos de 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 They are among the most prominent of Mexico's new rich, men of modest 
backgrounds who grew wealthy by investing in Mexico during the economic crisis 
of the early 1980s, when most old-line businessmen were trying to send money 
out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico is experiencing about 1,000 kidnapings a year, trailing only Brazil and 
Colombia in Latin America, according to Daniel F. Donohue, director of risk 
management for Kroll Associates of New York. He said the ransom appeared to be 
one of the largest in the world over the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing has been heard from Angel Losada Moreno, vice chairman of Grupo 
Gigante, the country's second-largest supermarket chain, since he was kidnaped 
April 25 in Mexico City.

CHARGE AGAINST JUDGE BREYER MINIMIZED BY WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY and PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House, reacting Friday to a report that Supreme Court nominee 
Stephen G. Breyer ruled in cases in which he had major financial interests, 
declared its continued confidence in the Boston judge and said that it does not 
expect the charges to affect his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer, who had as much $500,000 invested in the insurance conglomerate Lloyds 
of London in the mid to late 1980s, ruled in several cases that dealt with 
companies' liability for the cleanup of Superfund sites, according to a report 
in Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
 The rulings may have affected the London firm's exposure to liability in legal 
actions that involved Superfund sites, as well as in asbestos cases, the 
Newsday report suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal ethicists responded with caution to the report. But Senate aides said it 
will almost certainly prompt a further look. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are alarm bells going off in the Senate? No," said one Senate staff member. 
"Should people be concerned and will (the committee) inquire? Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials disputed the suggestion that Breyer issued 
rulings in cases where he knew his investments were at stake. The judge 
regularly disclosed his investment with Lloyds by filing public financial 
documents, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, officials said, Breyer "went far beyond what the rules require" 
by instructing the broker who placed his Lloyds investment to steer clear of 
units within the insurance group that had stakes in American tort liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond those instructions, White House officials said, Breyer was not in a 
position to learn the firms his investments were used to underwrite. Thus, they 
said, he could not knowingly have ruled in cases where he had a personal 
financial stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyds, one of the world's largest and most prestigious insurance firms, is 
made up of "syndicates" -- groups of investors who hope to reap returns when 
the insurance premiums collected are greater than the claims made against them. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler told Newsday that "there was no case to 
Judge Breyer's knowledge where his syndicate or Lloyds itself had an interest 
in the particular case he was deciding."

 President Clinton on Friday joined the growing cultural and political war 
between Democrats and their critics on the right, bitterly assailing Christian 
broadcasters and conservative radio talk-show hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 In unusually angry and aggressive remarks during a radio interview, Clinton 
attacked the Rev. Jerry Falwell and popular radio personality Rush Limbaugh by 
name, saying that their brand of politics and religion feed a spreading 
intolerance and cynicism across America. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenor and heat of his remarks showed what is increasingly becoming 
apparent -- that for those in the roiling political battle, this is less a 
contest between strong adversaries with some mutual respect than a holy war 
fueled by bitterness and personal loathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spoke by telephone from Air Force One as he was flying to St. Louis to 
inaugurate a youth service program and headline a $1,500-a-plate fund-raiser 
for House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
 The President said that televangelist Falwell and other spokesmen for the 
religious right hide behind their fervent protestations of faith while engaging 
in baseless personal attacks and political demagoguery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe that people should be criticized for their religious 
convictions," Clinton said. "But neither do I believe that people can put on 
the mantle of religion and then justify anything they say or do." 
</P>
<P>
 The President called Falwell's Christian values questionable when he uses his 
church and his access to television to promote a videotape attacking Clinton's 
honesty and morality. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that the Falwell tape, which includes lurid allegations about 
Clinton's sex life, his personal finances and assorted skullduggery in 
Arkansas, is full of "scurrilous and false charges." 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember," Clinton said, "Jesus threw the money-changers out of the temple. 
He didn't try to take over the job of the money-changers." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Cable News Network later Friday, Falwell dismissed 
Clinton's criticism and invited the President to tape a personal rebuttal to 
the videotape for use on the "Old Time Gospel Hour," which airs on 200 stations 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the President should really direct his denials and apparent anger at 
those making the charges, we will be happy to provide him a forum for rebutting 
those charges, assuming he has watched the video, knows what the charges are 
and addresses them specifically," Falwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's growing frustration not only with his legislative difficulties but 
with the unanswered attacks on his character was evident in the 23-minute 
interview with radio station KMOX. 
</P>
<P>
 He was testy from the outset, then unloaded on radio interviewers Charles 
Brennan and Kevin Horrigan after they asked about the alleged pilfering of 
towels and bathrobes from the aircraft carrier George Washington by White House 
staff members on the President's recent trip to Europe to commemorate the D-day 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all the things you could have asked me about and you just asked me 
about that," Clinton said, his voice rising in wrath. "Did you know that there 
were other people on that aircraft carrier? Did you know that there were press 
people on the aircraft carrier? Did you know that the carrier had been fully 
reimbursed out of the private pocket of a White House staff member who was so 
upset about it. . . ? No. No." 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers went out of her way to insist that 
Clinton was not angry. He was shouting only to be heard over the engine noise 
of Air Force One, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't angry and didn't want to leave the impression that he was," Myers 
said after reading wire service accounts that described the President as 
inflamed. "It sounded a lot harder than it was." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that Clinton did not intend to point fingers at any individuals. "I 
think the President just spoke his mind," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's assault on Falwell, Limbaugh and other critics elevated to a new 
plane a battle that Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento) launched earlier this 
week with an attack on the Republican Party and its supporters from the 
"intolerant . . . religious right." 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio warned that radical fringe groups are seizing control of the GOP in more 
than a dozen states and are threatening to become a major force in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio's comments were denounced by Republican leaders as "religious bigotry" 
and a "calculated smear campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear Friday that Clinton would join Fazio's line of attack as part of 
the Democratic Party strategy to demonize the right and stanch Democratic 
losses in the November mid-term elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said he respects the religious convictions of evangelicals but 
that he would not be silent "when people come into the political system and 
they say that anybody that doesn't agree with them is Godless, anyone who 
doesn't agree with them is not a good Christian, anyone who doesn't agree with 
them is fair game for any wild charge, no matter how false, for any kind of 
personal, demeaning attack." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falwell tape sells for $43, and tens of thousands reportedly have been 
sold. The people quoted on the tape are several longtime enemies of Clinton 
who, among other things, suggest that Clinton was involved in several murders 
in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Falwell aide Mark DeMoss has said that he does not know if the charges are 
true but believes they should be aired so they can be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 House Republicans also responded to Clinton's comments. "People who go to work 
on Monday and church on Sunday are not public enemies," said Rep. Dick Armey 
(R-Tex.), who chairs the House GOP Conference. "Clinton should be putting an 
end to this McCarthyistic tactic now, rather than fanning the flames and 
setting up some religious right bogeyman." 
</P>
<P>
 The mainstream media also did not escape Friday's presidential ire. Clinton 
complained that the reporting on his Administration has emphasized its failures 
unfairly and ignored its accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that news reporting today is "much more negative . . , much more 
editorial . . . and much less direct" than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said that the American people were subjected to a "constant unremitting 
drumbeat of negativism and cynicism" from talk radio -- particularly Limbaugh 
and his many imitators. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton noted that the three-hour Limbaugh show would follow him on the same 
radio station and that he would have no opportunity for response or challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there's no truth detector," Clinton said. "You won't get on afterwards 
and say what was true and what wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh, in his show Friday, answered the President mockingly, "There is no 
need for a truth detector. I am the truth detector." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that he had given up hope of receiving better treatment from the 
press, the religious broadcasters and talk radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I decided instead of being frustrated, I needed to be aggressive and I'm 
going to be aggressive from here on in. I'm going to tell what I know the truth 
to be," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 So no more Mr. Nice Guy? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be very nice about it," the President said, "but I'm going to be 
aggressive about it."

SLAIN GULF SOLDIER'S WIDOW SENTENCED TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The widow of a Persian Gulf War soldier was sentenced Friday to life in prison 
without parole for plotting the 1991 murder of her husband to cash in on his 
insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Cato Riggs, 25, who was convicted of first-degree murder on June 8, 
received the mandatory sentence for conspiring with her brother to kill her 
husband, Anthony Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had argued that Riggs hired her brother, Michael Cato, to shoot 
her husband outside the couple's Detroit home just days after he returned from 
Saudi Arabia where he served as a Patriot missile crewman. 
</P>
<P>
 The national media had initially portrayed the incident as a symbol of 
violence in the United States -- a combat veteran who was felled by a random 
drive-by shooting just days after returning from the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggs had collected $150,000 in life insurance money after her husband's 
death.

INSECTICIDE SPRAYING OF PASSENGERS ON AIRLINERS COMING UNDER SCRUTINY; 
CHEMICALS: MANY COUNTRIES REQUIRE 'DISINSECTION' OF TRAVELERS. POLITICAL AND 
DIPLOMATIC ISSUES FACE U.S. OFFICIALS SEEKING CHANGES. 
</P>

<P>
 Flying to St. Lucia on their honeymoon recently, Andrew Fish and his wife got 
more than complimentary beverages and a couple of bags of peanuts. They and 
their fellow passengers also got a dose of D-phenothrin, a powerful roach 
killer sprayed throughout the cabin of the commercial airliner during the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 So do millions of unwitting air travelers flying from the United States to 
more than 20 countries around the world, most of them in Latin America and the 
Caribbean. Under "disinsection" regulations enforced by many foreign 
governments, passengers and flight crews of incoming airliners are required to 
be sprayed with insecticide before disembarking. The purpose is to prevent the 
spread of diseases carried by insects. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Clinton Administration, which has begun an effort to stem the use of 
dangerous pesticides in the United States, that practice is becoming a tricky 
political issue at home and a delicate diplomatic issue abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 D-phenothrin is the same chemical found in such commonly used household 
pesticides as Black Knight Roach Killer. The user label on that can warns: 
"avoid breathing; avoid contact with skin and eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 In airplanes, it is dispensed as "Airosol Aircraft Insecticide," a product 
registered by the Environmental Protection Agency -- in error, the agency now 
admits -- for use in airplane cabins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it hard to believe that spraying roach killer on people in planes is 
safe," said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), a member of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee who is crusading to halt the practice or to require full disclosure 
to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States can't force foreign governments to change their disinfectant 
requirements, Leahy said. But, he added, it certainly can work to discourage 
the practice and, meanwhile, can insist that passengers know where they'll be 
sprayed and with what. 
</P>
<P>
 Leahy has asked the Administration to look into the practice. But he also 
hopes to use his position on the Senate Appropriations Committee's foreign 
operations subcommittee, which dispenses foreign aid to many of the countries 
that require disinsection, to end the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, airline companies say they have little choice but to comply 
with the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the middle on this," said Joe Hopkins, media relations manager for 
United Airlines. "It's required by the governments of the countries we fly 
into, and if we were not to comply, they could lift our certificates." 
</P>
<P>
 As air travelers go, Fish and his wife, Alicia Bambara, are unusual: Because 
Bambara is an aide to Leahy, they knew they would be sprayed. But even under 
repeated questioning, the crew of the U.S. carrier that they flew to St. Lucia 
was unable to tell them exactly when in the flight they would be sprayed or 
what pesticide compound would be used. In some aircraft, the pesticide is 
disbursed through the cabin's internal ventilation system, while in others 
flight attendants pass through the cabin with a small aerosol can, spraying 
around and above passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passengers should have a right to know that this is happening," Bambara said. 
"If it's safe, well, that's fine. But people still have a right to know, even 
if it is safe. Some people may have allergies or chemical sensitivities." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 15.2 million passengers aboard U.S. airliners were dosed with 
pesticide in an effort to prevent them from carrying unwanted insects into 
foreign countries, according to the U.S. Transportation Department. In addition 
to Latin American countries stretching from Chile to Mexico, countries 
requiring the disinsection include Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. 
territories of Guam and Northern Mariana Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States itself required the pesticide treatment of many incoming 
flights until 1979. But it discontinued the practice after the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention raised health concerns about such spraying and 
suggested that it was ineffective in controlling disease or containing the 
spread of insects. 
</P>
<P>
 D-Phenothrin belongs to a family of chemicals called synthetic pyrethroids. 
While the EPA has found no evidence of long-term toxicity from such chemicals, 
independent scientists are finding increasing evidence that pyrethroids can 
disrupt the human hormone system and cause reproductive disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying has a more immediate effect on those with lung disease and 
chemical sensitivity. A growing body of travelers and airline personnel have 
filed legal proceedings complaining of shortness of breath, burning, irritation 
and dizziness. Experts said that even more potentially harmful to travelers 
than the pesticides are the solvents used to mix the chemicals, which could 
make those with a high sensitivity to chemicals seriously ill. In the worst 
case, the EPA said it could lead to convulsions among those with chemical 
hypersensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Most countries require the pesticide to be sprayed on passengers during 
flight, with the aircraft's ventilators turned off. In principle, that assures 
that the chemical will linger long enough to do its work. But experts said it 
also assures that the chemical will be breathed by passengers and flight crews. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, countries that have required the spraying in the past have 
received cables from Transportation Secretary Federico Pena urging them to 
discontinue the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 If they do not, Pena plans to direct U.S. airlines to alert travelers when 
they book flights to countries that require disinsection that they will be 
sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the EPA has found that a 1979 decision allowing the use of 
D-phenothrin on airplanes was issued in error. It is requiring the two 
commercial producers of the insecticide to conduct additional tests on the 
toxicity of the compound as it is used in airline cabins. 
</P>
<P>
 If those studies are not done, or if the results are unsatisfactory, EPA would 
cancel the registration for the airplane insecticide. 
</P>
<P>
 For airliners flying from the United States into countries that continue to 
require the practice, the result would be "major disruption," according to 
Stephen Johnson, director of the EPA's pesticides registration division. Since 
it would be illegal for aircraft to carry unregistered pesticides into the 
United States, they would have to pick up their U.S. passengers, fly to a 
second country to pick up a pesticide, and treat passengers in the air en route 
to their final destination. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the dispute could halt U.S. air traffic to most of Latin America, 
the Caribbean, New Zealand and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 All for a practice that appears to do no good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would doubt it's very effective," Texas A&M University entomologist Bill 
Plapp said. "The quarantine procedures to keep out bugs are working about as 
effectively as those designed to keep out people. There's so much travel around 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the Administration has pinned its hopes on gentle persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our hope," Johnson said, "that these countries will reconsider the 
practice and stop (requiring) it."

MAN GETS $570,000 IN TAINTED BLOOD CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who developed AIDS after a transfusion was awarded $570,000 in the first 
successful lawsuit of its kind against the organization that establishes 
blood-screening standards for the nation's blood banks. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bergen County Superior Court jury ordered the American Assn. of Blood Banks 
on Thursday to pay William Snyder $405,000 in compensatory damages and an 
estimated $165,000 in interest.Snyder, 67, said he contracted the human 
immunodeficiency virus from a blood transfusion following heart surgery in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder's lawyer, George Baxter, had argued that while a test for the AIDS 
virus was not available until 1985, the association knew as early as 1983 that 
a "surrogate test" for a type of hepatitis would have detected blood donors 
carrying a still-unidentified virus that turned out to be HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 The association recommended against using the test in January, 1983, Baxter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Association attorney Edwin R. Matthews said the Bethesda, Md.-based group 
plans to appeal the decision.

POLITICAL FIGHT MOUNTS OVER ANTI-CRIME BILL; CONGRESS: GOP'S UNHAPPINESS WITH A 
'RACIAL JUSTICE' PROVISION THREATENS THE LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it cleared the Senate and the House by overwhelming margins, this year's 
anti-crime bill looked like a proposal whose time had come. 
</P>
<P>
 It offered a President hungry for domestic accomplishments a way of spawning 
innovative projects in cities large and small. And it offered lawmakers with 
violence-plagued constituents an opportunity to demonstrate determination to 
crack down on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But somewhere on the way to its gala signing ceremony, the 
most-likely-to-succeed package is in danger of disappearing in deep political 
quicksand. 
</P>
<P>
 The widespread agreement on many of its aspects is now being overshadowed by a 
bitter fight over one provision that relates to racial disparity between 
convicted murderers who receive the death penalty and those who do not. The 
so-called "racial justice" provision, which was passed only by the House, has 
become such an explosive issue that it threatens to trigger a Senate filibuster 
and jeopardize passage of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 An increasingly anxious White House and Democratic leaders in Congress are 
struggling to find a route through a minefield of racial politics to passage of 
the measure, but so far they have been stumped. "I think we are in a real box," 
said one House Democratic leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate, which is being waged as House and Senate negotiators try to find a 
compromise anti-crime bill acceptable to each chamber, says as much as anything 
about the very different ways that various coalitions in Congress react to the 
crime issue as well as the limits on the White House's ability to cope with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial justice provision, sponsored by Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), a 
longtime civil rights advocate, would allow defendants convicted of capital 
crimes to challenge their death sentences by producing statistical evidence to 
prove that the penalty was being applied in a discriminatory manner in their 
area of the country. The judge who presided over a challenged conviction then 
would be empowered to change the sentence to life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the debate is a belief that in some regions, the death penalty is 
applied more often in cases where blacks murder whites than in cases of blacks 
murdering blacks or whites murdering whites. The issue is by no means clear, 
however, with advocates and opponents alike marshaling statistics that they 
contend either prove or disprove that such bias exists. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision barely passed the House on a 217-212 vote and was not included 
in the Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will identify in certain jurisdictions those crimes for which blacks 
frequently get the death penalty while white defendants rarely do," Edwards 
said in a recent letter to colleagues. "Only a defendant who can show that his 
case fits such a pattern of racial disparity can invoke the act." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Edwards said, prosecutors would have a chance to rebut claims of 
racial bias, with the decision made by a judge based on a preponderance of the 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, however, view the measure as an indirect attack on the death 
penalty rather than as a procedure to deal with alleged racial bias in capital 
cases. They said that the true intent of the provision is to provide defendants 
with another vehicle for appeal, one that is subject to laborious statistical 
arguments that will further tie up the courts and limit executions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), who has led the fight against the measure in the 
House, has said its passage "would mean the end of the death penalty in most 
jurisdictions where it currently exists." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), whose views on crime issues are shared by most of 
his GOP colleagues, said there is no way to compare one death sentence with 
another, since the circumstances of each case are different. Any attempts to 
deal with racial bias, he said, should be limited to "the four corners of the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see many Republican votes for the bill with the racial justice 
provision in it," Hyde said. The compromise proposals floated by Democrats so 
far have failed to make the provision more acceptable, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, several Republican senators have threatened to kill the entire 
crime bill by filibustering if it includes the provision. Some Democrats said 
that delay in the Senate-House negotiations is necessary so that the 60 votes 
needed to end a possible filibuster can be found. Democrats hold 56 of the 100 
seats in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats have to watch their left flank too. If the provision is abandoned or 
weakened substantially in conference, the bill could run into trouble among 
House liberals, especially among members of the Congressional Black Caucus and 
the Hispanic Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there can be a credible crime bill without the racial justice 
act," said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to see the White House take a position and support it," said Rep. 
John Lewis (D-Ga.). "It's going to be tough to pass a bill without it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has never endorsed the provision, keeping himself aloof from the 
controversy that has raged on Capitol Hill over this part of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping the provision presumably would speed final approval but Clinton's 
involvement in any such strategy would offend some of his most loyal backers in 
the House as well as the 38 Democrats in the Black Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 "People underestimate what it will take to pass this bill," said Rep. Vic 
Fazio (D-West Sacramento), vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus. "We can't 
rush to judgment (on the crime bill) even though we'd like to do it quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 On other issues, the key Senate and House negotiators appear close to 
agreement on these provisions: 
</P>
<P>
 * $10.9 billion for state and local law enforcement over the next six years, 
including almost $9 billion to hire 100,000 police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 * $8.4 billion for state and local prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 * $7.6 billion for a variety of crime prevention programs, with an additional 
$1.4 billion for drug courts to encourage treatment of addicts rather than 
incarceration.

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; A VIOLENT DEJA VU; OFFICER'S ARRIVAL AT SCENE OF 
SLAYINGS BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF TATE MURDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The murder scene at Nicole Brown Simpson's condominium, said Los Angeles 
Police Officer William Richard Walley, one of the first officers to arrive, was 
as gruesome as any he has ever seen: The former wife of O.J. Simpson and a 
young man were found on the doorstep brutally stabbed with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 And Walley should know: He was one of the first officers on the scene at the 
Benedict Canyon home of Sharon Tate after the murders of the pregnant actress 
and five of her friends in August, 1969, by followers of Charles Manson. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a 22-year-old rookie, Walley was working in the LAPD's West Division when 
he was sent to the Tate house, where the victims had been stabbed repeatedly 
and blood had been splattered on the walls. Now 48, and with plans to retire in 
January, Walley finds it peculiar that his career opened and closes with 
arrivals on the scenes of two of the most shocking and high-profile murder 
cases in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen many murders over the years, and (Simpson's) was kind of a 
flashback . . . the celebrity involvement and an extremely violent scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Walley has seen "a lot of victims of shootings, stabbings, hangings -- 
everything there is to see in 27 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Walley, who has a gravelly voice and a reflective nature, works the night 
shift at the West Los Angeles station, where he has been assigned since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first hours of his shift on June 12, he and other officers were 
called to Nicole Simpson's townhouse on South Bundy Drive in Brentwood, where 
her body and that of her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Walley was ordered to search the house. "(Simpson's two) kids were sleeping in 
the house. After we conducted a search for any more victims, we got them 
dressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Walley said he took the two children, ages 9 and 6, "out the back way, through 
the garage. I had to lie to them." He would not say what he told the children. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove the children to the West Los Angeles station and then returned to the 
scene, directing curiosity-seekers away from the townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Walley said he had been to the Simpsons' house when O.J. and Nicole Simpson 
were still living together some years ago, on a social visit with a fellow 
officer who had attended college with the football Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
 Walley, a football fan, added that he got a kick out of seeing Simpson's 
Heisman Trophy, which he earned as a USC running back for the 1968 season, and 
all the other awards in a large and crowded trophy case. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other time he saw Simpson, Walley said, was when he turned himself in 
at the West Los Angeles station after the January, 1989, spousal abuse 
complaint by Nicole Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, at the scene of the Tate murders, Walley did guard duty and, after 
the bodies and evidence were removed, watched the house alone for 16 straight 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of people coming to the gate, looky-loos," he said. "My job 
was to walk around the house and watch, and keep people away. Since the house 
was on a hillside, people would climb up to try to get a look." 
</P>
<P>
 There were tense moments. "At around 11 p.m., I was sitting in my car, 
watching the house. It was so eerie; I was there by myself, we still had no 
suspects, and we didn't have radios then like we do now, so it was hard to 
communicate. I thought the suspects might return to the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, he said, "a cat jumped on the hood of my car, and I almost shot 
through the windshield." The next night he was paired with another officer to 
watch the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear was rampant on the Westside and through the canyons, he said, because 
there were no immediate arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rosemary and Leno LaBianca were killed a few miles from the Tate home two 
days later, the collective fright heightened. "People were paying off-duty cops 
to baby-sit their houses," Walley said. As the months passed, the fear 
subsided. Manson and others were arrested on murder charges in October of that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tate-LaBianca murders and the Simpson case, Walley said, seem equally 
extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the murders you see (as a cop) don't really bother you -- unless it's 
really drastic," he said.

2ND WATER DISTRICT OFFICIAL FINED IN CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita Water District's chief engineer became the second official 
punished over conflict-of-interest allegations when he agreed Friday to pay a 
$10,000 fine to settle a civil lawsuit filed by the Orange County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 William B. Dye, 58, the district's head engineer for 15 years, agreed to pay 
the fine and settle the complaint in which he was charged with six civil 
violations of the state's Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint alleges that between 1990 and 1992, Dye failed to disclose about 
$5,000 in gifts he received from two companies that did the bulk of the 
engineering work at the district. In addition, he recommended contracts to 
those companies, in violation of state law that prohibits such action on behalf 
of donors who have given more than $250 in the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Dye paid a fine that was twice the amount of gifts he received," said 
Marc Kelly, the deputy district attorney who is handling the Santa Margarita 
Water District cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no evidence of criminal intent. Mr. Dye was not living the high 
life, riding in limos or going on trips. But he still got quite a lot of meals 
and we felt it was appropriate to file the civil lawsuit against him," Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit and fine against Dye mirror similar action taken Wednesday against 
Don B. Schone, the district's former chairman. Schone agreed to pay a $10,000 
fine after prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit charging him with infractions 
similar to those Dye was accused of.

B-52 CRASH KILLS ALL 4 ON BOARD AT SPOKANE BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Air Force B-52 bomber crashed in flames Friday at Fairchild Air Force Base, 
killing the four people aboard, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The low-flying plane was in a steep bank when it spun to the ground and 
exploded in a fireball. The victims were not immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
 An Air Force board of officers will be appointed to determine the cause of the 
crash, said Staff Sgt. Allen Geisler. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no fire, smoke -- nothing until it hit the ground and there was a 
huge explosion. It was loud," said Jeff Calohan, who saw the plane go down as 
he was heading to a base store. 
</P>
<P>
 A police officer responding to the fiery crash was taken to the base hospital 
for smoke inhalation, but no other injuries were reported on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 An amateur videotape cameraman captured the crash and explosion of the plane, 
and the footage was shown by local and national TV news programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement by a White House spokesman, President Clinton asked the nation 
to pray for the families of the four dead Air Force officers from the 12th Air 
Combat Command. 
</P>
<P>
 The B-52 was practicing touch-and-go landings, in which a plane briefly 
touches down on a runway then takes off again. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plane was flying behind the bomber, which was about 300 to 400 feet 
off the ground when it went down south of the base's aircraft control tower 
shortly after 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Fairchild's B-52s were removed earlier this year as part of its 
transition to an air-refueling base, but several remained, including the one 
that crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fairchild B-52s were equipped to carry nuclear weapons, but Geisler said 
the plane that crashed carried none. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall visited the base about 10 miles west of 
Spokane on Friday, but had left several hours before the crash. Her visit was 
prompted by Monday's shooting spree by a disgruntled former airman. Six people, 
including the former airman, were killed and 23 were wounded.

LAPD'S TIGHT CONTROL ON GUN PERMITS MAY PROMPT NEW LAWSUIT; FIREARMS: POLICE 
HAVE GRANTED ONLY FIVE REQUESTS FROM FIRST 200 APPLICATIONS. ADVOCATES CLAIM 
THEY ARE FAILING TO COMPLY WITH TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Firearms advocates were jubilant last year as they predicted that thousands of 
Angelenos would soon be legally walking the streets with loaded guns in their 
pockets, purses and shoulder holsters. 
</P>
<P>
 A tentative out-of-court settlement had been reached that forced the Los 
Angeles Police Department to give concealed weapon permits to a dozen litigants 
in a lawsuit and to set up a policy for issuing such licenses to other 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit and the LAPD had a 
longstanding policy of refusing to issue any such licenses. Gun advocates 
predicted that 10,000 concealed weapon permits would be issued by the LAPD 
within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the nine months since the settlement was announced, only five permits 
have been issued from the first 200 applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun advocates are crying foul and say the settlement is coming unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of frustrated people out there who need a permit and they've 
come to us," said attorney David Yochelson, who is preparing to renew the legal 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials respond that if gun enthusiasts have their way, everyone in Los 
Angeles would be carrying a firearm and gun control advocates warn that 
concealed weapons only raise the level of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody in this country who believes that they are afforded greater 
protection from carrying a gun simply doesn't understand the danger when you 
introduce a firearm into a situation," said Sandy Cooney, western regional 
director of Handgun Control. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD has set up strict standards requiring that applicants for concealed 
weapon permits show a "clear and present danger" that cannot be handled by 
alternative security measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Four new permits went to attorneys: a county prosecutor, an assistant city 
attorney and two private lawyers. The fifth went to a city fire captain. Two 
applications have been approved but the permits have not yet been issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun advocates charge that city officials are stalling and have established an 
elitist concealed weapons policy. New litigants are being lined up to revive 
the dormant lawsuit or to bring new action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I myself have applied for a permit and been rejected," Yochelson said. "I 
believe in the right to protect myself -- not just in my home and business, but 
in my car when I go out at night or day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have a moral obligation to protect myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firearms author J. Neil Schulman, who helped organize the original suit 
against the city, agrees with Yochelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe as a matter of personal responsibility that when you're an adult, 
you give up the fantasy that the police are going to protect you," Schulman 
said. "The police cannot protect you when you are in danger. You have to rely 
on yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman was able to obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon from the 
Police Department in his hometown of Culver City, where applicants only need to 
state a general need to carry a firearm. The 139 weapons permits issued in 
Culver City last year were by far the most granted by any city police 
department in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun advocates involved in last year's tentative settlement have proposed that 
the LAPD adopt concealed weapon guidelines that are so broad that virtually 
anyone free of a criminal conviction or commitment for mental illness would 
qualify for a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed guidelines would state that it is "good cause" for a concealed 
weapons license to be issued if an applicant is "a realtor, merchant, 
firefighter, ambulance attendant or emergency medical technician, meter reader, 
delivery person, telephone or cable TV installer or other person who is 
required to work in or travel to or through areas with unusually high incidence 
of criminal victimization." 
</P>
<P>
 But the standards adopted by the city since the settlement are much stricter. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must state a specific and compelling reason for carrying a gun, as 
opposed to a general desire for self-protection, said Assistant City Atty. 
Byron Boeckman, who worked on the tentative settlement last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we operate on the theory that every person who applies just has to say 'I 
live in Los Angeles, I'm scared to death,' we would in effect have an on-demand 
policy," he said. "L.A. is a tough town to live in. On that basis, 3.1 million 
people would qualify." 
</P>
<P>
 Several states, such as Florida, have recently adopted policies of issuing 
concealed weapon permits on demand, but Boeckman does not believe that that 
should happen here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that the political climate in Los Angeles is going in that 
direction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for concealed weapon permits are processed by the LAPD gun detail 
and forwarded to Boeckman, a procedure that can take months. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Chief Willie L. Williams signs off on approved licenses, but the final 
decision is in reality made by Boeckman. 
</P>
<P>
 The handful of concealed weapon permits granted to non-litigants since 
September were among 200 applications, most of which were received before the 
settlement. Boeckman defended the approval rate as reasonable, but acknowledged 
that he has not had time to look at another 600 to 800 applications that are 
being processed by the gun detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the numbers are far short of the deluge of applications predicted by 
gun advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 One theory to explain the relatively low number of requests is that the LAPD's 
reputation for denying concealed weapon permits has discouraged applications. 
Another theory is that tens of thousands of Southern Californians have elected 
to routinely break the law and are carrying concealed weapons without permits, 
as indicated by a 1992 Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a misdemeanor in California to carry a concealed weapon or to transport 
a loaded firearm in a vehicle without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Each law enforcement agency in the state has the authority to set standards 
for granting concealed weapon permits to residents of the county in which the 
agencies are located.  
</P>
<P>
 Applicants who are unsuccessful in obtaining concealed weapon permits from the 
police jurisdiction of their hometowns may seek such licenses from other police 
departments within the county or from the county sheriff. Applicants may not be 
licensed by police agencies outside their counties of residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Criteria for granting concealed weapon permits vary widely from the tight 
controls of the LAPD and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to the 
on-demand policy of the Shasta County Sheriff's Department in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just anybody and everybody" with a clean record qualifies for a permit in 
Shasta County, where about 3,500 people can legally carry guns, said Kelly 
Carlson, sheriff's law enforcement clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Concealed weapon permits are normally granted for one year at a time and, 
unless otherwise stipulated, allow the holders to carry guns anywhere in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit that was tentatively settled last year accused the city of violating 
state law by denying all applications for concealed weapon permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD's new policy is based on standards used by the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other jurisdictions, both agencies require that an applicant's record be 
free of felonies, serious misdemeanors or commitments to mental institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the LAPD and Sheriff's Department require that an applicant for a 
concealed weapon show that there is a "clear and present danger" that cannot be 
handled by law enforcement officers or by alternative measures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the granting or denial of a permit appears to be a subjective decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department is more than twice as likely to issue a permit than 
the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 While the LAPD was approving seven out of 200 applications, for a 3.5% 
approval rate, the Sheriff's Department approved 88 of about 1,000 
applications, for an approval rate of nearly 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Shire, a jeweler who will probably be a new litigant in the dispute over 
concealed weapons, maintains that his application to carry a gun was denied 
because the LAPD policy is elitist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised that the permits go to attorneys or a fire captain," he 
said. "What about guys like me or other businessmen that have to carry large 
sums of money?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shire, who lives in Los Angeles and operates a jewelry store in West 
Hollywood, said on his concealed weapon application that he routinely carries 
large amounts of money and valuable goods in the course of buying and selling 
jewelry at pawn shops, swap meets and other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that he had been the victim of a burglary and that he had 
received death threats from a man who was grappling with a deputy and who was 
taken into custody with Shire's help. Shire said he provided police reports as 
documentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shire also presented documentation that he had completed defensive handgun 
training as well as a letter of reference from a sheriff's officer that the 
jeweler had done extensive public safety work with deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Shire's application, which was submitted Nov. 19, was denied last month. 
</P>
<P>
 By way of comparison, the concealed weapon application of attorney Dwight 
Henry Lindholm, submitted Sept. 10, was one of the seven approved by the LAPD 
since the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindholm presented evidence on his application that his life had been 
threatened by a former client. Lindholm also presented documentation that 
police and others considered the client dangerous and that the man had watched 
Lindholm's house from across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Shire, Lindholm said he had taken no firearms training course, but said 
that he had grown up with guns in a rural setting and that he had done target 
shooting as a hobby in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindholm was issued a permit to carry a 9-millimeter Smith & Wesson 
semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decisions to deny the application of the jeweler and grant the 
lawyer's were not based on elitism, Assistant City Atty. Boeckman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys, Boeckman said, face special dangers. Getting Permits

 Note: These figures reflect permits issued or renewed last year and do not 
include all the concealed weapon permits in the county. The Sheriff's 
Department, for example, has authorized 300 people to carry concealed weapons 
this year, but only 225 are in the tally of licenses issued last year. Some 
permit holders, such as retired FBI agents, are licensed for three years.

RELEASED CONDORS' FORAYS NEAR TOWN WORRY BIOLOGISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cousins of the California condors that were moved from the Sespe Condor 
Sanctuary in Ventura County to a more remote site have succumbed to the same 
attraction as the Sespe birds: They are too curious to stay away from populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists stationed in Ventura said this week 
that some of the five condors released at Lion Canyon in Santa Barbara County 
have begun roosting near the small community of New Cuyuma. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists have begun hazing the birds to urge them away from the rural town 
and back to the vast expanse of open mountains and plains in the Lion Canyon 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're expanding their range slowly from that (Lion Canyon) site," wildlife 
biologist Chris Barr said Thursday. "We're trying to encourage these birds to 
cover as much ground as they can to encourage them to forage farther." 
</P>
<P>
 Barr and a team of other Fish and Wildlife Service biologists monitor the five 
condors daily, leaving carcasses every few nights to feed the young birds. So 
far, the huge vultures have ventured as far as 25 miles from where they were 
released, Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the first eight condors released into the Sespe had to be captured and 
moved to Santa Barbara County after four others died in a series of accidents 
when they had encounters with civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 But biologists also reported more successes with the program to reintroduce 
the near-extinct birds. The captive breeding program produced the biggest crop 
of California condor chicks since the program began in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen of 21 eggs at zoos in Los Angeles and San Diego and a third site in 
Idaho hatched into healthy young birds during the first four months of the 1994 
breeding season, Barr said.

$5,348 AWARDED IN SUIT OVER BANDAGE IN MCDONALD'S BURGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who found a bloody Band-Aid in her McDonald's hamburger has been 
awarded more than $5,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 A Monterey County Superior Court jury this week awarded Charlsie Kelly $5,348 
for stress and anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly bit into the hamburger at a Pacific Grove McDonald's in 1992, then 
didn't think much about it until she mentioned it casually to a doctor several 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
 She testified that he and a second doctor advised her to get tested twice a 
year for 10 years to make sure she had not been infected with hepatitis or the 
virus that causes AIDS, said Jay Wesolowski, the lawyer who defended franchise 
owner McHof Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly was tested and the results were negative, but she sued McHof for 
$100,000 for anxiety and stress. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wesolowski, medical experts said a test with a follow-up in six 
months was all that would be needed to check for infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly was not allowed to talk about her fear of AIDS in front of the jury 
because of a state Supreme Court ruling last year that plaintiffs cannot 
recover monetary damages over fear of contracting a disease unless they could 
prove exposure to toxic substances and prove that they were more likely than 
not to become ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Through an agreement between Wesolowski and Kelly's attorney, Daniel Schrader 
of Monterey, the jury was informed that Kelly underwent needle tests that were 
painful and upsetting. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said there is no way to prove the Band-Aid exposed Kelly to any 
harmful substances, Wesolowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners admitted negligence and liability and said the only question was 
whether any injuries Kelly suffered were legally compensable.

ELDERS' COMMENTS ON RELIGIOUS RIGHT SPARK GOP CALL FOR HER OUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighty-seven GOP House members sought the resignation of Surgeon General 
Joycelyn Elders on Friday, escalating a conflict over Democrats' attacks on 
right-wing Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans' letter to President Clinton came two days after Elders, 
according to newspaper accounts, referred to the "un-Christian religious right" 
and added: "We've got to be strong to take on those people who are selling our 
children out in the name of religion." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter did not specifically mention these remarks, but they were cited at 
a news conference by Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.), the author of the letter, and 
by other lawmakers and spokesmen for conservative Christian organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "She should be using this office to fight sickness and disease and not using 
this office to fight parents and churches," Stearns said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter said Elders "has not chosen to utilize her position to advance the 
general health and welfare of all Americans, but rather to advocate views 
antithetical to the majority of citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 It denounced Elders for her remarks that the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts 
discriminated against homosexuals, that the legalization of narcotics should be 
considered and that girls should take condoms when they go on dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders' press spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 While speaking before gun-control advocates Thursday, Elders said she was not 
bothered by all of the criticism she has received from conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say the surgeon general has a bully pulpit. Well, I don't mind using 
this bully pulpit," Elders told about 150 people gathered for the start of the 
National Conference on Gun Violence in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, 44 Senate Republicans wrote Clinton asking him to repudiate 
remarks that reflect religious bigotry. That letter came after Rep. Vic Fazio 
(D-West Sacramento), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee, criticized the rise of the radical right in Republican politics.

COUPLE CHARGED WITH FILING 2,601 FRAUDULENT REQUESTS FOR ASYLUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the largest cases of such immigration fraud, a federal grand jury 
Friday indicted a San Bernardino couple on suspicion of filing more than 2,600 
bogus claims for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities charged that the couple -- doing business as General Office 
Services out of sites in El Monte, Azusa and Santa Ana -- employed a now-common 
scheme: Duping applicants, mostly illegal immigrants from Mexico, into thinking 
they were merely applying for permits to work in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, authorities said, the suspects charged clients up to $1,150 to file 
the phony applications for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The immigrants themselves have been duped by these preparers and are victims 
in this whole scenario," said Rosemary Melville, who heads the Los Angeles 
asylum office of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 After obtaining clients' signatures on the application forms, authorities 
said, the suspects filled in data about the purported political asylum claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the documents featured identical assertions, officials said, 
contending that applicants were opposition party members in Mexico and had been 
beaten by Mexican police. All feared for their lives if they returned home, the 
applications stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Many applicants receive work permits as a result of their applications while 
their cases are being considered. However, work permits in this case were later 
revoked -- and the applicants made subject to deportation -- once officials 
determined that the asylum claims were bogus. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of asylum applicants from Mexico has been growing sharply, 
authorities say, though Mexican nationals seldom qualify for political asylum. 
Foreigners persecuted in their homelands because of their race, creed, 
political opinions or membership in social groups may qualify, allowing them to 
remain and work in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged were Cecilia Parra Sanchez, 45, and her husband, Emilio Parra Garcia, 
27. He was arrested earlier this month at his San Bernardino residence but his 
wife remains a fugitive, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents searching the couple's home discovered copies of 2,601 
fraudulent asylum cases that had been filed with the INS, U.S. Atty. Nora M. 
Manella said.

 Well, it's always difficult finding a parking place in L.A.: Working at the 
state Department of Aging has left Robert Brumberger with pains in his back, 
neck and shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Brumberger was at his desk in West L.A. one recent morning when he felt a 
tremendous crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing I know, I'm being thrown across the room," he recalled. "There 
was a chair on top of me and I'm thinking, 'Oh, it's another earthquake.' Then 
I look up and see there's a car in my office." 
</P>
<P>
 A car that was emitting smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "To make things worse," Brumberger continued, "my supervisor comes running in 
with a fire extinguisher, not seeing me, and starts squirting the (carbon 
dioxide) stuff so it's choking me and blinding me." 
</P>
<P>
 Brumberger has been on leave since the accident. The driver was shaken but 
appeared to be uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least," Brumberger said, "she had insurance."

 Dodger Stadium's most famous hurler: That, of course, is celebrity vendor 
Roger (the Peanut Man) Owens, famed for his long behind-the-back tosses.  
</P>
<P>
 We were worried when we heard he was seen tossing goobers this week at a 
California League game in Adelanto (near Victorville). 
</P>
<P>
 Had he been optioned to the minors to recover from peanut elbow? (Darryl 
Strawberry leaving was one thing, but this. . . .) Fortunately, the answer is 
no. "I was making a guest appearance out there," explained Owens, now in his 
36th year at Dodger Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 Though performing in a lower classification in Adelanto, Owens admitted he had 
a shaky first inning. "I had to allow for a wind whipping around there," he 
said. "And I was throwing single bags rather than the double ones, like at 
Dodger Stadium. I was off the mark on a couple of double-behind-the-back 
tosses." 
</P>
<P>
 Owens, who appeared as a peasant peanut vendor in Mel Brooks' "Robin Hood: Men 
in Tights," was sought out by Adelanto's young vendors for advice. Not on 
throwing techniques, though -- you know how young people are these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to know how much I make in commissions at major league games," 
Owens said.

SACRAMENTO WATCH; CAPITOL HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Frank Hill, convicted last week on corruption charges, "resigned" his 
Senate seat Thursday but refused to say when he will actually leave. Because of 
his conviction, Hill already had been stripped of his committee assignments and 
had voluntarily agreed not to vote on any bills.Why stick around then?  
</P>
<P>
 Why indeed. Secluded in his Capitol office, the Whittier Republican has 
continued to draw his $52,000-a-year salary and $101-a-day tax-free living 
allowance. Incredibly, a state law requiring elected officials to resign 
following conviction of a serious crime does not apply to legislators, who can 
be expelled only by a two-thirds vote of their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of Hill's Senate colleagues -- legislators who one hopes would have 
greater sensitivity to growing public outrage about legislative corruption and 
ineptitude -- seem to have no appetite to evict this man from their midst. 
Senate GOP leader Ken Maddy said lawmakers see Hill as a good friend. "I think 
he was more of a victim of circumstances and the venue than he is of committing 
a crime," Maddy said. Pardon us, but Hill was no victim. He was videotaped 
accepting a $2,500 honorarium from an FBI agent posing as a businessman seeking 
a legislative favor. 
</P>
<P>
 One response to this mess has been a plan to introduce a legislative 
constitutional amendment calling for automatic loss of office -- and pay -- 
upon conviction of a felony. Another has been a resolution aimed specifically 
at Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers owe it to the people, and to themselves, to support both of 
these measures, not the least out of self-respect.

GUESS WHO WASN'T INVITED?; UNBELIEVABLE GAFFE OVER AFRICA CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House conference on Africa that will begin Sunday looks to be a 
public relations disaster before it has even begun. Predictably, damage control 
is under way, but this is one gaffe that the Clinton Administration probably 
won't be allowed to forget. 
</P>
<P>
 The incredible story goes like this: You're the White House and you want to 
put together and host a conference to elevate Africa to the top tier of concern 
in the United States. Such conferences typically focus a media spotlight on key 
issues and encourage national dialogue. And Africa could certainly benefit from 
more international attention. Great cause, but whom do you fail to invite until 
far too late? The members of the Congressional Black Caucus, a powerful voting 
bloc.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, most were not invited until the last minute -- almost as an afterthought. 
The very leaders who pay such close attention to Africa and are among the 
United States' foremost champions of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the lack of formal invitations and the eleventh-hour telephone 
calls asking them to participate, many of the members of the 40-member bloc 
(whose votes President Clinton needs for such legislation as the crime bill) 
are threatening to skip the two-day session. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are staying away because they wish to underscore their opposition to 
the Administration's plodding policy on Africa and particularly the slow 
movement in Rwanda's crisis. Still others are claiming prior commitments. 
Eventually some of those who say they won't attend may show up. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher insists many will attend. But there's no denying that 
feelings have been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The invitations foul-up notwithstanding, why the short notice of the 
conference? Such White House meetings typically are announced months in 
advance. The Africa conference was announced only Wednesday, just days before 
more than 100 experts and others will gather. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellingly, Black Caucus members aren't the only prominent African Americans 
angry over how the Administration has handled the Africa meeting. Randall 
Robinson, the director of TransAfrica, a respected lobbying group for Africa 
and the Caribbean, will also boycott the sessions. Robinson, who's angry about 
U.S. policy on Haiti and who is greatly respected for his historic direction of 
the national anti-apartheid movement against South Africa, carries weight among 
African Americans and many liberal Democrats, two constituencies President 
Clinton cannot afford to take for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton team has been in the White House long enough to get the hang of 
how things work in Washington -- politically at least. There's no excuse for 
this debacle.

THE VALUE OF RESEARCH ON WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To young women, Friday's article by Times medical writer Thomas H. Maugh II 
looked like bad news: Women who are pregnant when breast cancer is diagnosed 
are three times more likely to die of the disease and the effect doesn't fade 
entirely until five years after the last pregnancy. But, paradoxically, the end 
result of this knowledge will be fewer deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The international research led by doctors at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center 
in Houston and reported today in the medical journal Lancet is the sort of 
gender-specific research that women's organizations have long called for. 
Doctors always knew that younger women died more often of breast cancer, and 
that many cancers, in both men and women, are more virulent in younger people. 
Now that pregnancy is known to be such a large factor, more research is 
indicated to determine which hormonal or immunological factors of pregnancy are 
involved in raising the risk and whether women with high known risk factors for 
breast cancer are particularly vulnerable. Knowledge is the first prerequisite 
to better prevention and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 While this research is somber news, it is not a reason for women to fear 
pregnancy. Breast cancer is rare in young women, hitting only one woman in 
2,426 by age 30, compared with one in eight over a lifetime. And not all women 
are at equal risk of contracting breast cancer while young. Earlier research 
has shown a much higher risk for women with a strong familial pattern of breast 
cancer, peaking in women whose mothers had pre-menopausal cancer in both 
breasts. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest report is part of a recent spate of studies on breast cancer, 
including one that found better survival results for pre-menopausal breast 
cancer patients who had surgery at mid-cycle, near the time of ovulation. 
</P>
<P>
 That breast cancer is apparently exacerbated by the hormonal and immunological 
changes of pregnancy is not much of a surprise, but no one had done the 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other sorts of gender-specific research that need similar attention, 
particularly the inclusion of women in trials of new drugs. Almost all of what 
we know about the safety and efficacy of drugs comes from trials on adult men, 
for reasons including worry that a trial participant might be pregnant. But the 
breast cancer findings are proof of the benefits of gender-specific studies.

GAME THAT'S MORE THAN A GAME; COMPUTER 'REPLAY' OF WORLD WAR II POINTS TO A 
LARGER PROBLEM IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the hottest-selling computer games in Japan these days are those that 
replay the Pacific phase of World War II and reverse its result: Japan wins, 
the United States and its allies lose. 
</P>
<P>
 The enormous popularity of this series -- one game alone has sold 3 million 
copies since 1990 -- might be attributed to nothing more than relatively 
harmless fantasizing by a generation of younger people who lack any personal 
memories of the war. But such fantasizing loses any claim to innocence when 
Japan's official refusal to deal honestly with the harsh truths about its 
aggression in Asia is taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan as a nation has never fully accepted responsibility for the war it waged 
or the atrocities its forces committed, as Germany has. That determined act of 
denial continues to worry Japan's neighbors. It worries thoughtful Japanese no 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, among them pacifists and some historians, condemn the computer games 
for their lack of reality as well as for the utter insensitivity to subject 
peoples they often show. In one game, Japanese troops are given a three-day 
leave in Saigon. Their commander issues the order, "Comfort." The implications 
are his men will be free to enjoy themselves with local women who were forced 
under the Japanese occupation into sexual slavery, a category that has come to 
be known as "comfort women" in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the evasiveness, ambiguities and outright silence that typically 
characterize the depiction of many World War II events in government-approved 
Japanese textbooks, postwar generations have come to maturity knowing far too 
little about a vital part of their country's modern history. The computer games 
can be seen as a lucrative extension of this ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ugly facts disturb and repel. Witness, in our own history, the inability of 
many whites to deal with slavery's degrading human and spiritual implications 
both before and after it was forcibly ended as an institution. That turning 
away exacted a terrible price. Japan's continuing refusal to face historical 
truths also will not be cost-free.

REYNOLDS' DONATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Richard P. Corpis' letter (June 15) accusing me of not donating 
my personal funds to help fight tobacco use, the fact is that I have personally 
given over $1.5 million of my $2.5 million inheritance to the fight for that 
cause. I make no apology for using the remaining balance to support and fuel my 
campaign for a smoke-free America.I divested all my tobacco stock in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the cigarette tax, the reason it's appropriate to single out tobacco is 
that cigarettes are the only products which, when used as intended, cause 
disease and death. The medical costs of smoking are estimated at $2.17 per pack 
smoked. Should nonsmokers pay for this?  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to my personal funds, I have given my time; the fact is, I have 
been devoted to this cause full time since 1986. While I do get paid 
honorariums when speaking at colleges and health conferences, this is how I 
earn my living. I care deeply about the problem of smoking, and will continue 
to fight for increased regulation of the tobacco companies, and for a 
smoke-free society.

PRESIDENT'S WELFARE REFORM PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Clinton Unveils Welfare Reform," June 15: 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Congress trip over themselves to enact punitive welfare reform 
every year, saving pennies at the expense of women and children, yet they 
cannot pass a revised mining law or repeal tobacco subsidies, losing billions 
of dollars every year.  
</P>
<P>
 Funny how Republicans seem to lose their will to reduce spending when it hurts 
their buddies or their own pocketbooks!

 * As the debate about welfare reform drones on, is it surprising that not a 
single word is being said that links welfare to its bigger cousin, public 
housing? In 1992, federal expenditures for the Housing and Urban Development 
program amounted to $24.4 billion compared to $22.8 billion for the food stamp 
program. It is clear that more money is being spent on housing subsidies than 
on food stamps. The costs for AFDC are being trumpeted to the public every day. 
What is not being mentioned is the cost of housing subsidies. This 
shortsightedness will doom any attempts at welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, President Clinton proposed doubling the budget for the homeless to 
$1.7 billion, citing homelessness as a national problem. A draft of the report, 
"Priority: Home! The Federal Plan to End Homelessness," says that were HUD to 
be spending what it should, its budget would rise no less than $15 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we are being told that part of the way the Administration plans on 
raising the $9.3 billion necessary for job training and subsidized job programs 
is by cutting the budget for the homeless.

 * Reading the mean-spiritedness of "liberal" Bill Clinton's health care plan 
and welfare reform plan (June 15), I am reminded of a passage in "The Fever" by 
Wallace Shawn: 
</P>
<P>
 "Voting for sincere politicians who believe fervently in gradual change does 
not change the life of the poor, because sincere politicians who believe 
fervently in gradual change do not change the life of the poor."

<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The vast majority of people on welfare want to get off it. Jobs are what 
they need most. Not minimum-wage jobs but jobs that pay a living wage. Money 
has been appropriated for job training. How many times in the past have we had 
job training and at the end of the training found that no jobs are available? 
There is no reason to believe this will change. Single mothers do not plan to 
have children. Education and counseling can help them to avoid the pitfalls of 
having unplanned children. And if there are children, it is wrong to punish 
them for the questionable actions of the mothers. Yet we do this all the time.

DISCIPLINE CASE

<P>
 I am quoted in a June 5 article reporting that a federal court committee 
recommended discipline for lawyer Stephen Yagman, after a three-judge panel 
found that he made charges against a federal judge "falsely and without 
foundation."In discussing the kinds of statements the 1st Amendment does not 
protect, I used the phrase "wild ad hominem charges," which the article quotes. 
Yagman has written to tell me that this phrase does not accurately describe his 
particular alleged charges. I retract any contrary implication.

CAL/EPA RISK STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "EPA's Newest Hazard: Risks to Peace of Mind" (June 11) reported on a 
forthcoming Cal/EPA study on environmental priority setting that will emphasize 
issues affecting the "peace of mind" of communities over priorities based on 
scientific assessment of risk. The article also pointed out that there is 
little data to support the Cal/EPA study finding that "pollution hot spots" 
disproportionately affect minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace of mind" environmental priorities are not new, and the Cal/EPA study 
will only make explicit what is already being done. Overwhelming uncertainties 
in science-based risk assessment have meant that policy-makers have always had 
to use "peace of mind" concerns to establish environmental policy. In many 
cases such concerns serve as a suitable surrogate for scientific risk 
assessments containing unknown uncertainty and statistical bias. Given this 
reality, and the fact that some communities are more effective than others at 
voicing concerns, the Cal/EPA report brings forth a critical point; there must 
be "peace of mind" for all communities -- black, white, brown, yellow, Native 
American, rich or poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Few would choose not to improve the scientific basis for policy or to ignore 
what is known. We suspect that many issues that have not yet aroused "peace of 
mind" concerns -- such as indoor exposure to air toxics -- nonetheless pose 
significant risks. More generally, the way science and analytical disciplines 
are used in environmental policy-making can be vastly improved. Scientific peer 
review, systematic data gathering and independent evaluation are rare 
occurrences in this overly politicized field. The inability to find confirming 
data for minority community "pollution hot spots" is more a comment on the 
entire process our society uses to formulate environmental policy than on the 
validity of this particular issue. 
</P>
<P>
 We must explicitly recognize that both scientific assessment and "peace of 
mind" are important parts of environmental priority setting. The ways in which 
government utilizes both can be vastly improved.

RIGHTS OF GAYS AND LESBIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed the article "Spirit of Achievement Marks Gay Pride Parade" (June 
13). However, the writer made one statement in the article that wasn't entirely 
correct. Referring to the Stonewall riot in June, 1969, she wrote that it "gave 
birth to the fledgling gay and lesbian civil rights movement." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Stonewall riot is one of the most important events, and surely a 
major turning point in the fight for gay rights, it was hardly the beginning of 
it. Here in Los Angeles, Vice Versa, the first magazine for lesbians, began 
publication in 1947; Physique Pictorial, a magazine for gay men, started in 
1951; ONE magazine was also started in 1951 and was seized by the post office, 
which led to a groundbreaking Supreme Court decision in 1958, which said that 
ONE served the needs of the gay community, and therefore was not pornographic. 
The Advocate, now the nation's oldest gay publication, was started in 1967. The 
Mattachine Society, the country's first influential gay rights organization, 
was formed in 1950. There was a gay Christian church in L.A. as far back as 
1956, and Metropolitan Community Church, now the world's largest gay church, 
was established in 1968. L.A. had its own share of gay rights protests in the 
1960s, most notably in January, 1966, after the LAPD raided a couple of gay 
bars on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 To say that the Stonewall riot was the start of lesbian and gay rights is a 
disservice to all the brave men and women who lived openly and fought for gay 
and lesbian rights in the decades before Stonewall, risking their freedom, 
livelihood and lives.

 * All right, out with it. Do the homosexuals have an agenda for the domestic 
partnership bill (June 9)? It's no secret. This bill is another steppingstone 
toward full civil rights for lesbian and gay people. Gays and lesbians need 
this bill more than heterosexual couples who choose not to marry. As those who 
oppose the bill are quick to point out: Heterosexual couples can marry if they 
choose, and anyone can make out a will and appoint a conservator through the 
durable power of attorney for health care and finances. Homosexuals do not 
enjoy the right to marry their life partners or to have their relationships 
recognized by the state.

 It is understandable that many ordinary Americans aren't into soccer, since 
the sport has gotten so little exposure here. But professional sportswriters 
and sportscasters who belittle it -- whose job it is to know and appreciate

to learn what they don't know, and who have never attended a showdown match 
between great teams before a passionate crowd -- have no excuse. We should feel

 To whom it may concern at ABC:

 After avidly following your exclusive coverage of the U.S. Open, I was 
appalled when you switched during the sudden-death playoff to the O.J. Simpson 
arraignment while every other station covered the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 You had the only exclusive audience on television and you blew it.

 My reaction to the preemption of the NBA playoff game by TV coverage of O.J. 
Simpson's procession from Orange County to his home was that seldom in history 
has more time and effort been expended by anything less significant. I thought 
that at least The Times would be more professional in its coverage. What I saw 
Saturday morning was about half of the first section of the newspaper devoted 
to the subject. It seems that the media has lost all sense of perspective.

 It is difficult to fathom the mind-boggling events concerning the O.J. Simpson 
tragedy. I know I feel a deep sense of sadness for Nicole Brown Simpson and 
Ronald Goldman, and sympathy for their families. As for O.J., I just don't want 
to believe that he could commit such a horrific act. I know that some of the 
evidence seems compelling, but let's not forget that stranger things have 
happened than the possibility of Simpson's innocence. As for his questionable 
conduct, I think you'd have to walk a mile in O.J.'s cleats before you get the 
answer to those questions. Even then you'll probably only discover that you're 
walking in some pretty big cleats.

'MARVELOUS MARV' THRONEBERRY DIES; BASEBALL: FIRST BASEMAN ON BUMBLING '62 METS 
WHO LATER STARRED IN BEER COMMERCIALS SUCCUMBS TO CANCER. HE WAS 60. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former major leaguer Marv Throneberry, who had his best year for the New York 
Mets during one of the team's worst seasons, has died of cancer. He was 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Throneberry, nicknamed "Marvelous Marv" during his career as a first baseman, 
died Thursday night at his home in Fisherville, a small rural community near 
Collierville, about 22 miles east of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 Throneberry played on one of the worst teams in baseball history, the 1962 New 
York Mets. The Mets were 40-120 that year, but it was Throneberry's best year 
with 16 home runs and 49 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 He played from 1958-1963. He was with the New York Yankees in 1958 and 1959, 
including one appearance in the '58 World Series. He spent 1960 and part of 
1961 with the Kansas City Athletics, before joining the Baltimore Orioles in 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
 He started 1962 with Baltimore, but played only nine games. He joined the Mets 
during their expansion season of 1962, and played there until he retired in 
1963. He hit .237 during his career with 53 home runs and 170 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Throneberry was probably best known for appearing in several Miller Lite Beer 
commercials with more well-known athletes, saying "I still don't know why they 
asked me to do this commercial." 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Dixie; three daughters, Gail Brewer of Pleasant 
Hill, Calif.; Sandra Clement and Lorie Throneberry, both of Rossville, Tenn., 
and two sons, Gil Throneberry of Fisherville, Tenn., and Jody Throneberry of 
Eads, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors also include a sister, Lurlene Peacock of Barry, Tex., and two 
brothers, Walter and Faye, both of Fisherville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Throneberry had 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

 Immortal peaches. What a concept! 
</P>
<P>
 Several East Asian cultures claim peaches as a common and appropriate symbol 
for eternal life and, even though I cannot say from whence this enticing 
symbolic image came, a pair of monumental folding screens currently in an 
exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art emphatically declares its 
gorgeous rightness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sun, Moon and Immortal Peaches," whose eight panels were probably painted a 
bit later than the 18th Century, is an idealized landscape of dizzying beauty. 
Sharply stylized in design, the pair of four-panel screens display a rigorously 
bilateral symmetry, as if the left and right halves are mirror images of each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 A golden, misty sky envelopes blue-green mountains that loom above the 
serpentine waves of a blue-green sea, punctuated by lacy white fingers of foam. 
From rocky outcroppings dotted with red fungus, two gnarled peach trees frame 
the scene. Above them, a perfect white disk is precisely matched by a perfect 
orange one, balancing the moon and the sun in a harmonious equation, like yin 
and yang. 
</P>
<P>
 Obvious signs of ancientness and immortality are abundant: craggy mountains, a 
horizonless sky, the lapping sea, the sun and moon. Some are more obscure, such 
as the curlicue fungus, which is of a type used to make a longevity potion. And 
then there are the peaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The peaches thrive in a ritualistically patterned landscape where earth, sea 
and sky meet. They stand out from their surroundings because, alone among the 
otherwise highly stylized pictorial elements, they are rendered with a careful 
naturalism. It is a naturalism that contrasts sharply with everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Like fat, fleshy, fuzzy, blush-colored little rumps, the corpulent peaches 
luxuriously seduce the eye. They promise sensual rewards that are frankly 
erotic. 
</P>
<P>
 At nearly 9 feet high and 11 wide, "Sun, Moon and Immortal Peaches" stands 
grandly at the entrance to "Korean Arts of the 18th Century: Splendor & 
Simplicity," a quietly sumptuous survey of 125 examples of furniture, 
calligraphy, textiles and, most notably, paintings and ceramics. The show 
chronicles the artistic output of the late Chosun Kingdom (roughly 1724 to 
1800, and coincident with the reigns of Yongjo and Chongjo), which is widely 
regarded as an era of prodigious cultural development amid far-reaching social 
transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the Asia Society Galleries in New York, in collaboration with the 
National Museum of Korea in Seoul, the spaciously installed exhibition is 
divided into three sequentially smaller parts. The first looks at the art of 
the royal court, the second at the domestic art of the hereditary aristocracy 
and the newly rising professional class (which included artists), the third at 
religious art. 
</P>
<P>
 Formally, the most immediately striking feature of court art is not its often 
ostentatious splendor. You expect showiness from royalty, of any time or place. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasized instead is a structural commitment to a gentle but rigorous ideal 
of orderliness and regimentation. A silk panel of indigo blue with seemingly 
abstract, decorative gold disks is actually a sky map celebrating an earthly 
relationship to the Big Dipper, a constellation perpetually visible in the 
Korean night. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, an eight-panel screen documenting a "Royal Visit to the City of 
Hwasong" maps out the processional journey with all the orchestrated detail of 
a tactical battle plan. The composition is bureaucratized: From a distance the 
screens seem like diagrams, or even pages from a highly refined accountant's 
ledger. 
</P>
<P>
 The composition, shown as a bird's-eye view rather than from within the 
hurly-burly of the traveling throng, overlays a godly omnipotence on the royal 
doings. There is a place for everything in the Chosun Kingdom, and everything 
is contentedly in its place -- especially the king, who acts as a kind of 
divinely ordained pivot between an expansive universe and secular society. 
Life's value is found in identifying one's place within the timeless clockwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The domestic arts in the second section retain something of this feeling, but 
scaled down to a more personal, intimate level. (Color drains too, usually 
replaced by muted tones.) An exquisite, highly refined self-portrait by Yun 
Duso describes the artist's features; yet, it also pictures a quest for 
self-knowledge, meticulously conducted through the medium of painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of wholly imaginative renderings, such as those found in the royal 
screens, paintings of actual sites in the Korean landscape also begin to 
appear. These so-called "true view" paintings signal a significant shift from 
imaginative symbolism to worldly affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even here, however, the emphasis is on idealization. Vistas worthy of being 
painted are determined according to highly acculturated principles, in which 
ideas of scenic beauty are preconceived. A farmer isn't portrayed merely 
tilling his field; he's glimpsed beyond an artfully placed and shaped tree, 
beneath which two men contemplatively sit. A "true view" privileges some 
landscapes over others, so that all is right with the carefully ordered world. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most beautiful objects in the show are the ceramics, especially the 
large storage jars of glazed porcelain (several have been designated as 
official national treasures). Some are elegantly painted with traditional 
dragon motifs, using iron-brown or cobalt-blue underglazes, while one employs 
an eccentric mixture of landscape designs within cartouches surrounded by 
formal characters signifying wealth, longevity and strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The most exciting porcelain, however, is a milk-white monochrome jar, not at 
all rigidly symmetrical in its swelling, ovoid form, but nonetheless full and 
radiant as the moon. The bulgy, slightly irregular shape of the 19-inch pot 
yields an earthy quality of organic liveliness, subtly endowing the fired 
porcelain jar with the vitality of a living thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The final, relatively small gallery focuses on religious objects and subjects, 
including ancestor worship, shamanistic rituals, Buddhist shrines and ritual 
implements. After the relatively restrained royal and domestic sections, a 
surprising wildness marks some of this work -- especially the Buddhist 
paintings and carvings, perhaps because of the prevalence of mythological 
subjects. Imaginative flights of dramatic, colorful intensity are not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it may be incorrect to consider Korean religious art of the 18th 
Century as distinctly different or in a class by itself. Competing sects of 
Buddhism and shamanism didn't dominate the era, Confucianism did. As might be 
expected from a philosophy vigorously promoted as normative by the ruling 
classes, Confucian principles are imbued throughout the secular and courtly art 
in the rest of the show. They can't be separated out. 
</P>
<P>
 You wouldn't really know that from the exhibition, though. A drawback of 
"Splendor & Simplicity," which presents the late Chosun Kingdom as a kind of 
East Asian Enlightenment, on which the modern era would rest, is its reluctance 
to contextualize this art in any but the most rudimentary way. (The show's 
informative catalogue is therefore essential to read.) The exhibition is 
content to marshal its considerable resources in order to seduce you with the 
formal power of its often gorgeous objects.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; FORD ON THE ROAD: RELIABLE, HARD-DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guitarist Robben Ford spent a brief period in Miles Davis' electric band in 
the mid-'80s, injecting the kind of blues-washed, Hendrix-inspired lines that 
Davis favored in his last years. That same approach has served Ford well during 
the years he's been out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the guitarist's Coach House concert Thursday didn't vary much from his 
local appearances in the last couple years, no one seemed to mind. After all, 
Ford was doing what he does best with his high-powered, jazz-flavored band, the 
Blue Line: rifling through blistering guitar lines and wah-wah effects 
stretched tight over hyperactive bass-and-drum play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Line's modern take on the blues tradition extends the hybrid 
initiated by Cream and others in the '60s. But Ford's contemporary slant will 
keep things fresh only as long as he keeps adding material. Thursday's show was 
too much of the same old thing from Ford and his crew. 
</P>
<P>
 It needed more of the kind of play the band engaged in at the show's close, 
when Ford paid homage to his late boss. Bassist Roscoe Beck struck up the 
familiar lines of Davis' "All Blues" before the band joined in for some 
interplay that echoed the trumpeter's classic 1969 "Bitches Brew" session 
(which featured guitarist John McLaughlin). 
</P>
<P>
 From there the band jumped back into more familiar sounds: chuck-a-luck rhythm 
guitar pinned by tough bass lines and almost manic timekeeping from drummer Tom 
Brechtlein. Despite his jazz leanings, Ford's most attractive quality is his 
ability to make the blues rock. 
</P>
<P>
 An added feature of this show was the enlistment of a second guitarist, David 
Grissom, whose attitude-plus picking contrasted nicely with Ford's more 
confident attack. Grissom's spare accompaniment served to free Ford to pursue 
higher meaning, and the leader took full advantage, making his guitar rant, 
scream and whimper. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grissom used acoustic guitar to back Ford on "Mystic Mile," the moody lament 
that moves along on a riff resembling B.B. King's "The Thrill Is Gone." Ford 
matched Grissom's reserved backing with warm, sliding tones played with the 
innocence of a child's voice. Rather than build dynamically, the tune became 
even more soft-spoken as it progressed, with the two guitarists exchanging cool 
licks before closing in a series of ever quieter tones. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, this was an up-tempo affair with plenty of dynamic 
excitement and muscular flair. "Busted Up" featured Ford's crying wah-wah 
effects. "The Plunge" moved to a funky beat with Ford pulling some Wes 
Montgomery-styled chording from his electric instrument. "Start It Up" shuffled 
through a number of clever stops and changes before Ford whipped up one of his 
most inspired improvisations. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, the guitarist doesn't rely solely on flash to get his point 
across. His solos build logically and are filled with plenty of contemplative 
space before blasting off again. Ford has oodles of technique; luckily, he also 
has something to say. 
</P>
<P>
 His voice is another manner. Though not an unpleasant instrument, Ford's voice 
remained within a narrow range, seldom straying to the higher reaches or 
employing tonal variations, such as growls, yells or hog calls. As long as he 
stays within his range, he sounds a bit like Ricky Nelson did, albeit a Nelson 
with his nose firmly pinched by a clothespin. 
</P>
<P>
 Brechtlein's potent drumming is the power behind this band. His hard-hitting 
snare and tom-tom play, often with both hands smashing away in unison, not only 
makes for stimulating listening, but also provides visual stimulation, as he 
shakes his head in time to the onslaught. As a team, Beck and Brechtlein are 
tight, empathetic and eager to stir things up.

AN AMERICAN'S VISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to clarify a few points made in Lewis Segal's review of the Aman 
Folk Ensemble dance concert ("Around the World With Dean, Aman," June 21). 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the unnamed founders of Aman, indeed I believe that I did have a 
"uniquely American vision" because I am an American, but there was never any 
intention to "offer a world-dance panorama on every program."I did not consider 
myself then, nor now, sufficiently versed in the worldwide scope that Aman, by 
all accounts, currently espouses to represent on the stage the kind of 
potpourri repertoire that Segal describes. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Segal did not mention my name as a founder of Aman because the company 
did not put it in the company's biography. My current company, AVAZ, continues 
the aesthetic framework laid out by me during my tenure as one of the founding 
artistic directors of Aman: to perform the dances of a region linked by 
aesthetic and historic ties -- the Middle East, Central Asia, Eastern Europe 
and the Mediterranean.

 Robert Koehler's TV review of the documentary "One Nation Under God" accuses 
the filmmakers (and myself) of "tribal-like loathings" and "accusatory stances" 
for our criticism of reparative therapy for gays and lesbians ("Gays, Lesbians 
and Hate," June 14). He says the film displays hate. It's not hate, Mr. 
Koehler. It's anger. And the anger is justified. 
</P>
<P>
 As a gay man who secretly struggled for years to come to terms with my 
sexuality, I am angry that too many gay and lesbian kids still grow up hating 
themselves (and often killing themselves) because their culture, their churches 
(and groups like Exodus) tell them they're sick, sinful and worthy of eternal 
punishment.  
</P>
<P>
 As a Christian, I am angry that the Bible (the revelation of God's love for 
all people) is still being used to justify the persecution of gays and 
lesbians, in the same way that it has been used to justify the ongoing 
persecution of Jews, blacks, women and others. 
</P>
<P>
 As a father who has tried to teach my child the harm that can be done by 
stereotyping, I am angered by "reparative therapists" who seem to be saying 
that there is only one way to be "truly feminine" or "truly masculine." 
</P>
<P>
 My comment about "Stepford wives" was a criticism of this sexist attitude, not 
a dismissal of the people who apply makeup to help "ex-lesbians" look pretty. I 
feel sorry for these people. They seem both comic and tragic, but I do not hate 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine losing your friends and lovers to AIDS while the church and the 
government stall. Imagine getting fired from your job because you are gay. 
Imagine experiencing the rejection of your family. Imagine spending years 
praying and hoping, believing that God must not love you. Or just listen to the 
hatred that pours from America's pulpits every Sunday morning.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps then you will understand the intensity of the anger we express. 
Perhaps then you will not dismiss us as hatemongers. Perhaps then real dialogue 
can start.

ACCENT ON U.S. STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a pattern going on in Hollywood that has as much to say about America 
as it does about the movie industry. Where are the beautiful and talented 
actresses who have foreign accents? 
</P>
<P>
 One way to stardom in movies is to create a sensation -- get noticed in a 
really "showy" role. 
</P>
<P>
 Persis Khambatta ("Star Trek -- The Motion Picture"), Marthe Keller ("Bobby 
Deerfield"), Sonia Braga ("Kiss of the Spider Woman"), Nastassja Kinski 
("Tess") and others have done that.  
</P>
<P>
 But their careers in the United States did not skyrocket. Despite the legends, 
Greta Garbo and Sophia Loren, American audiences still are reticent to embrace 
performers with accents, and Hollywood doesn't want to make the effort to sell 
it to them. Why won't U.S. audiences accept subtitles? Why are not only 
foreign-language films marginalized in "art houses," but also most 
English-language films from Britain and Australia as well? 
</P>
<P>
 What does this say about us? Many Americans grew (grow) up with parents or 
grandparents who are immigrants, who speak with an accent, yet they reject them 
on the screen. It would be sobering to hear what these actresses have to say 
about Hollywood.

 I have some practical suggestions regarding the American Civil Liberties Union 
honoring "guerrilla artist" Robbie Conal at the Brentwood home of Betty and 
Stanley K. Sheinbaum ("ACLU Honors," Morning Report, June 11): 
</P>
<P>
 I recommend, seeing how fond the ACLU and the Sheinbaums are of Conal's "art," 
that they submit themselves to his plastering his efforts free of charge on 
their property any time he likes, just like Conal has done on the buildings, 
traffic signals and other public and private property in Los Angeles. Of 
course, they will also agree to leave it there for months as it weathers and 
becomes more unsightly than it was in the first place. It's all for the noble 
cause of free speech, after all.

'MOON OVER MADNESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his review of "Moon Over Madness" (" 'Moon' Aims High, but It's Not Quite a 
Cirque Thing," June 20), Don Shirley neglected to tell readers that the show 
received a standing ovation. What does that tell you? The show is fun, funny, 
full of surprises, full of heart and wonderful to look at. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the beginning of something marvelous for our city. This is a 
show created by and for Angelenos. It is clowns, dancers, mimes, musicians, 
puppeteers, jugglers and gymnasts creating something new. It is uniquely 
Angeleno in its vision and sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 People in the cast hope to create a new "Moon Over Madness" each year. The 
collaboration of artists from many disciplines could continue. The show could 
visit other cities, presenting a vibrant, creative aspect of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot claim to be objective. I helped the cast finish building the show in 
the week before it opened. So, don't listen to me. Listen to the 2,000 people 
who stood up and cheered, then come see this show when it returns to the John 
Anson Ford Amphitheatre.

MORE ON TICKETMASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the dispute between Ticketmaster and Pearl Jam ("Pearl Jam vs. 
Ticketmaster: Choosing Sides," June 8): 
</P>
<P>
 Recently a friend and I decided to splurge on opera tickets at $95 apiece.I 
went to the Ticketmaster outlet at my local Tower Records store, only to find 
that, while they could give me my tickets on the spot, they took cash only -- 
no credit cards. Not having $200 on me, I went home and called the Ticketmaster 
phone number. No problem with credit cards there -- but, unfortunately, they 
couldn't tell me where I'd be sitting!  
</P>
<P>
 In frustration, I called the public relations office of the Music Center to 
ask why the outlets didn't take credit cards, or why they couldn't tell me over 
the phone where I'd be sitting. The woman I spoke to was sympathetic but could 
offer nothing beyond the lame explanation that to choose a seat over the phone 
would take too long. 
</P>
<P>
 My options were to get tickets directly at the box office or to go to the 
Ticketmaster outlet at the nearest Robinsons-May store (for some reason, 
they'll accept that store's credit cards). 
</P>
<P>
 If the Ticketmaster outlets at Robinsons-May can accept credit cards, why 
can't the Tower outlets do it? And why can't they tell you over the phone where 
you'll be sitting? 
</P>
<P>
 If they had a little more competition, perhaps Ticketmaster wouldn't be so 
arrogant in their treatment of consumers. I fully support Pearl Jam in their 
suit.

TV REVIEW; TV HALL OF FAME: IT'S THE PRESENTERS' SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1984, when the Television Academy Hall of Fame named its first inductees, 
Milton Berle led the list. Ten years later, the new inductees include Phil 
Donahue and soap opera scribe Agnes Nixon. This TV institution is beginning to 
resemble not so much a Hall of Fame as the Walk of Fame down Hollywood 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Walk, however, is much more exciting than the 90-minute taped 
broadcast of the awards, presented in late 1993 at, of all places, Walt Disney 
World. You want something, something to happen during what should be an 
emotional occasion honoring, along with Donahue and Nixon, Dick ("American 
Bandstand") Clark, NBC News' John Chancellor, Bob Newhart and, posthumously, 
game show maestro Mark Goodson and Jack ("Dragnet") Webb. 
</P>
<P>
 Something does happen: Clark sobs so uncontrollably that he must step away 
from the podium to compose himself -- an extremely rare break in the 
"Bandstand" man's famously cool demeanor. But Clark opens the show, and it's 
mostly downhill from there. 
</P>
<P>
 The speechifying is split up by video tribute clips so banal that viewers too 
young to know these Hall of Famers will wonder what the fuss is about. (The 
clips for Nixon, the first female writer inductee and creator of "All My 
Children," "One Life to Live" and "Loving," cruelly display just how 
atrociously bad soap writing and acting can be.)  
</P>
<P>
 Only the archive footage of Chancellor's career suggests a man trying to do 
something meaningful with the medium, and the clips of Webb deadpanning with 
Harry Morgan on "Dragnet" are priceless, if far too brief. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, the presenters are often more memorable than the honorees. Marlo Thomas 
shows she has thoroughly maintained a sense of class so long gone from husband 
Phil's show it's hard to recall when it left. Donahue's other presenter, former 
Soviet apologist and current Donahue partner on a CNBC chat show, Vladmir 
Posner, actually salutes "America's First Amendment." And, a little sadly, 
Newhart is totally upstaged by the show's funniest moments: Don Rickles, at his 
acerbic best, and Tim Conway, in the kind of routine of which only real Hall of 
Famers are capable. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Television Academy Hall of Fame Special" airs at 8 tonight on ABC 
(Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42).

SHOLOM ALEICHEM FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to thank the Los Angeles Times for the excellent articles about the 
festival for Sholom Aleichem that took place at the Orange County Jewish 
Community Center on June 5 ("Around and About," OC Live!, June 2; "On the Man 
Behind 'Fiddler on the Roof,' " Calendar, June 4). 
</P>
<P>
 The stories, by Benjamin Epstein, covered all the essential details and 
captured the flavor of the festival. I most appreciated his checking with me 
several times to clarify things. Best of all, he asked me intelligent and 
penetrating questions about the event that also helped me to better understand 
it as a whole.

SETTING THE TONE; STRIKE A NEW BALANCE WITH STROKES OF PAINT IN FRESH COLOR 
SCHEMES FOR THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pure sunlight of Southern California summer shows flaws as well as 
perfection, and it may well be telling you -- if someone else in your house or 
the neighbors haven't already -- that it is time to paint. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are one of the tens of thousands of Orange County residents whose home 
was built in tract housing booms from the 1950s through the early 1980s, you 
might be wondering -- as you mull over paint chips and the task ahead -- how to 
update the look of your home to help it visually enter the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that hard to do. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the best of it, the experts say, approach house painting as you would 
any involved task. Consider the situation; map out a plan, including colors; 
purchase the necessary materials; prepare the structures to be painted and then 
grab your brushes and rollers and get to work. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if you hire someone else to do it, remember, it is your house and you 
have to live with the result, so stay involved in the decision making. 
</P>
<P>
 Color consultant Miriam Tate, who makes her living designing color schemes for 
some of the West's largest new home builders, says lack of planning can ruin a 
paint job before the first patch of pigment is applied. The paint scheme itself 
might have been carefully worked out, but usually only in the context of what 
it looks like on the house. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to inventory your entire canvas, and that canvas begins at the 
curb," said Tate. "So walk across the street and study your house and yard from 
there. See how it fits into the neighborhood and onto the lot. You want to plan 
a color story, and to be successful that story has to start at the curb." 
</P>
<P>
 She talks of paint schemes in terms of "stories" to be told through the 
colors. In a single-level ranch house, typical stories might be horizontal and 
rectangular: the white trim around windows repeated in the fascia panel along 
the roof line and the long lintel over the garage door. In a multilevel house, 
the stories might be vertical and triangular: the colors in porch columns and 
the frames of tall stacks of windows repeated up high on the facade on 
ornamental louvers or medallions affixed to the stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 In simpler terms, telling the proper story simply means balancing blocks of 
color and accent tones. If you paint the front window and door trim green on 
the left side of the house, don't make things lopsided by painting the garage 
door on the right side white without any hint of the same green. If there is 
brick or wood trim on one side of the front of the house but not the other, 
create balance by painting it the same color as the rest of the siding or by 
painting something on the other side of the facade in shades that match the 
wood or brick tones.  
</P>
<P>
 Tate, who develops color stories for entire tracts of homes rather than for 
one house at a time, suggests dividing the property into its largest masses -- 
usually the driveway, the stucco or siding on the house and garage, and the 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
 If the driveway is white concrete, a predominantly white color scheme could 
well be too monotone. To add necessary definition, Tate suggests bordering the 
driveway and front walk with materials that repeat the colors in the roof of 
the house -- even using concrete stains to color the driveway itself. Sponge 
painting, the same technique used on walls, works well on driveways. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the roof is a wooden shake or split shingle, as so many in Southern 
California still are, the texture it provides is likely to be all you need; 
don't overkill with more textures on the house itself in the form of heavy 
wooden or rough masonry trim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pick out colors last" when doing a job for a builder, said Tate. "We study 
the architecture for a couple of weeks first to get to know what shapes and 
textures we must deal with.' 
</P>
<P>
 For owners of the bare bones 1950s-1970s tract houses that cover most of the 
flatlands of central and north Orange County, the architectural detailing that 
is so much a part of new home design often can be captured easily and 
inexpensively with a few pre-painting add-ons. 
</P>
<P>
 The "pop out" raised window borders and other dimensional features that 
builders paint with contrasting colors on new homes can be added to older 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 They can be in the form of window boxes, wooden frames around aluminum 
windows, new wooden trim or fascia boards, architectural trellises that are 
made to be painted rather than covered by plants, even masonry or stone veneer 
applied judiciously. Tate's especially fond of framed louvered vents. They come 
round, square, rectangular, even triangular, and while they don't ventilate 
anything when added after the house is built, they provide relief that can 
carry one or two accent colors high up on the otherwise flat exterior walls of 
a house. 
</P>
<P>
 To help figure out how you want to paint your house (which comes before 
deciding the precise colors you want to use), Tate says it helps to realize 
that cool colors make houses seem bigger because they join the structure to the 
sky while warm colors make a house smaller by joining it to the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, she suggests avoiding all of one or the other: an all cool 
scheme alienates the viewer while an all warm scheme can make people jittery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trick is to decide what you want to predominate, and then to chose a 
number of colors that create a balance when applied to the house. 
</P>
<P>
 In older neighborhoods, Tate said, landscaping usually is quite developed and 
there are lots of large trees and shrubs that supply a lot of cool color -- so 
make sure to balance them with warm tones on the house, preferably as the 
primary color, repeating the cool tones on the trim. 
</P>
<P>
 In new tracts, Tate uses color to create an environment where not much exists 
yet. So she balances the streetscapes with some of the homes done in 
predominantly warm colors while cool colors predominate in others. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking colors is a highly personal thing -- that paint chip that whispers 
"beautiful buttery hue" to you might scream "ugly, jaundiced yellow!" to your 
next door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are a few guidelines that can help most everyone make informed 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, of course, is balance -- don't use all cool or all warm 
colors. And do consider the colors on surfaces like the roof and the drive and 
walkways to be part of the overall scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 If you chose a relatively neutral color for the base color on your house, you 
can heat it up by having the paint store shade it with something from the warm 
side of the color wheel: the red-orange-yellow family. Conversely, the same 
neutral color can be cooled by shading it with blues, greens or purples. White 
is cool, brown is warm.  
</P>
<P>
 The same can of beige can be made warm by blending in undertones of red or 
yellow, and cool with undertones of blue or green. 
</P>
<P>
 If your house has a thick, heavy stucco with a rugged texture, it will make 
any color you pick look several shades darker. 
</P>
<P>
 And when picking colors, do not stand inside and and study the 1-by-2-inch 
samples, or chips, that most paint stores display. Ask for an architectural 
sample, typically a 3-by-5-inch chip, then take it outside at midday and look 
at it head on and, from the side, by holding it at arm's length to the left or 
right of your torso at shoulder level and turning your head to view it. You 
will get a much better feel for what the color will look like on the exterior 
of your house. 
</P>
<P>
 Pick colors that have been toned down with grays or browns -- "you want the 
edge taken off of them," Tate said. For a house that really has personality, 
pick colors with multiple undertones -- the color of the house will change as 
the quality of the light varies throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the exterior color scheme, the interior of a house can be 
lightened significantly by painting the eaves a bright, clear white that will 
reflect light to the inside. Painting eaves and patio covers in dark colors 
that absorb light will make things much dimmer inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be afraid of using several colors -- the typical tract house being built 
today has four to six colors: the base, the trim that frames windows and doors, 
an accent color or two on architectural details and the thin moldings or 
"stops" that often are part of window and garage door framing, and finally an 
over-painted area or two -- bands of complementary or contrasting color painted 
directly over the base color on the stucco or siding. 
</P>
<P>
 When painting stucco, use a paint that is clearly labeled for masonry or 
stucco -- it will soak in better and last longer than paints blended for wood 
siding. 
</P>
<P>
 When replacing older wooden tilt-up garage doors with metal sectional or 
roll-up doors, don't confuse the primer with which they are coated at the 
factory with a final coat. It is primer, go ahead and paint it. 
</P>
<P>
 Garage doors look smaller when they are separated from the surface of the 
house by bands of color -- one on the heavy framing and another on the 
quarter-inch stops that are applied around the inside of the frames. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't paint exterior doors in dark colors if they are exposed to the sun -- 
the heat will bake the paint and cause the doors to warp. And never paint one 
side of an exterior door and stain the other -- each finish has its own heat 
and moisture retention characteristics, and they aren't compatible. The result 
will be a warped, sticking door. 
</P>
<P>
 As a general rule, accent and trim colors animate a feature, so don't use them 
on things that ought to stay in the background -- rain gutters, gas meters, the 
metal covers for telephone and electrical equipment boxes should be painted the 
same color as the part of the house they're attached to. They don't deserve to 
be picked out for special attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Tate said, treat the whole house, including the garage, with the same 
attention to detail the area around the entry gets. Don't add architectural or 
painted embellishments to the ground floor and forget the second story; if you 
add shutters to the ground floor living room windows out front, put them on the 
upstairs bedroom windows as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember in all your decisions, balance is key. 
</P>
<P>
 1990s: Color scheme uses a shadow-gray base paint combined with bright white 
trim and terra-cotta accents in the shutters, entry door and stop strip around 
the garage doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The strip of windows in the roll-up garage doors helps minimize their mass and 
accent color on the stop surrounding the doors makes them look smaller while 
carrying color scheme into that area. Stacked living room window treatment 
gives the left side of the facade a warmer, open look and visually reduces 
height of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 1960's: Mustard-and-brown color scheme was common. Dark brown garage doors and 
trim absorb light and become the most dominant feature of the house -- a look 
that helped give rise to the criticism that Southern California is the home of 
the $200,000 garage door. The windows, framed in a dark color, seem small and 
unwelcoming. The absence of any accent colors or architectural relief makes the 
face of the structure appear towering and blank. 
</P>
<P>
 1970's-80's: The same house in white with forest green trim and stained wood 
doors. Painting the garage door moldings the same green as the window and door 
moldings, facia boards and chimney cap unites the color scheme and balances the 
facade, but the lack of accent pieces such as shutters and window boxes leaves 
the house looking plain. The white, while a good choice for many homes, tends 
to make structures look larger and spaces empty.

A HELPING HAND: CHECKING OUT OLD SHAKE SHINGLES? HIT THE ROOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. We're house-shopping, and all the homes we're looking at have shake roofs. 
I'm not too familiar with these, except I know they're a fire hazard and 
expensive to replace. Can you determine the condition of a shake roof just by 
looking at it from the ground? 
</P>
<P>
 B.N. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
 A. To really check a roof you need to get on top of it, but you can give it a 
cursory inspection from the ground, says Pete Gorman of Rancho Lumber in 
Westminster. Within a few months of installation, shake roofs generally turn 
gray, so color isn't a good indication of condition. After 15 to 20 years, they 
begin to deteriorate. Look for shakes that are split, cracked or look aged. 
Shakes get brittle over time and crack easily. If you look up at a shake roof 
from the attic, you may see tiny gaps of light. This in itself may not be bad, 
because in the rain the water causes the shakes to swell and seal. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My wife and I are debating about the garbage disposal. She thinks it's fine 
to put eggshells and other hard items down there, while I think that's not good 
for the disposal. Who's right? 
</P>
<P>
 E.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 A. Eggshells are fine; they crumble easily. But you do have to be careful 
about other garbage, especially with an older disposal, says Rod Albright of 
Albright Plumbing & Heating in Los Alamitos. As it wears, the space where the 
cutting ring revolves gets bigger, so larger pieces of garbage get through. As 
the drain ages, it becomes narrower, and the bigger pieces of debris tend to 
plug it up and you get overflows into the sink.  
</P>
<P>
 People often don't use enough water when using the disposal. You need to run 
it with water flowing through, then after you turn it off continue letting the 
water run for half a minute to clear the trap. This will help keep it running 
freely and keep odors from rising back into the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I recently bought a ceiling fixture with a warning label that says one 
should use supply wire suitable for 75 degrees Celsius, and that most dwellings 
built before 1985 have wiring rated at 60 degrees. Our house was built prior to 
1985, and it has aluminum wiring. What should I do? 
</P>
<P>
 W.K.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 A. Those warnings are mainly to make you aware of a change in building codes, 
says Mike McCoy of Current Supply in Westminster. You can still install your 
fixture, just make sure it's tight and properly connected, as per the 
instructions.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry about having aluminum wiring; it's very common and found in 
thousands of homes around the county. Aluminum isn't as efficient a conductor 
of electricity as copper is, and it tends to expand and contract with 
temperature changes. This loosens connections and is one of the reasons it is 
no longer used in new construction. It's a good idea to check the connections 
at your outlets annually and tighten them if they're done with aluminum wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. A friend staying with me recently washed my fairly new no-wax one-piece 
kitchen floor and used a liquid abrasive cleaner in some spots, which left dull 
patches. Can it be restored? 
</P>
<P>
 D.K. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 A. You may want to try some common floor wax, says Steve Hix of Aaron 
Anthony's Floor Coverings in Anaheim. Apply it on those areas that have lost 
their shine and see if it helps. To keep that shine, you really do have to be 
careful about what you use on no-wax floors. Always check with the dealer or 
manufacturer about what cleaner is recommended and stick to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What's the trick to painting door hinges so that the paint won't crack and 
peel when the hinge moves? 
</P>
<P>
 S.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A. Remove them from the door and strip them down to the bare metal, says Joe 
Ragsdale of Color Center in La Mirada. Use a metal or oil-based primer on them, 
then apply thin coats of your paint. Many people think they should use thick 
coats to keep something covered, but thin coats are generally more effective on 
items such as hinges.

DISCOVERIES: INSIDE & OUT; IMPRESSIONABLE ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vibrant colors and expressive patterns are the mark of Manic Impressions, 
Jennifer Irani's collection of home accessories and paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Irani, 34, of Newport Beach, combines her interest in art with textile design 
by silk-screening designs from her original paintings onto place mats, napkins, 
pillows and slipcovers, among other items. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to bring art out of the gallery and the museum," said Irani, a UC 
Irvine graduate who draws inspiration from music and history. The name of her 
company, which she started in 1991, was derived from a Jimi Hendrix song. 
</P>
<P>
 Irani uses washable, nontoxic paints for her works, which have a jazzy, 
turn-of-the-century feel. Her pillows, which come in a variety of fabrics, are 
$18 to $30 for a 14-inch square and $38 to $80 for a 22-inch piece. A set of 
four place mats (canvas) and napkins (Pima cotton) sells for about $70. The 
slipcovers are custom-order items. 
</P>
<P>
 New to Irani's line this summer are children's pillows (about $20, and they're 
washable, too), made of cotton in primary colors with ball fringe. 
</P>
<P>
 Manic Impressions accessories are available at the Laguna Art Museum in South 
Coast Plaza, Hilary's and Marianna II in Laguna Beach and the Tapas Bar & Grill 
in Newport Beach. For more information, call (714) 650-0520. Tile File

<P>
 Piero Fornasetti's "Mongolfiere" hot-air balloon designs have landed on 
ceramic tiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The designs, rendered by Bardelli of Hastings Tile in New York City, are set 
on a white, glazed background and are available in a full set of two dozen 
five-square-inch tiles. The set ($376) can be purchased at Eurobath & Tile in 
Costa Mesa and Bath Concept Studio in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceramic tiles from around the world are on display at the International Tile & 
Stone Exposition at the Anaheim Convention Center. The exposition is open to 
the public today from 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Admission is free. Out of the Dark 
</P>
<P>
 Lights On!, an automatic standby fluorescent lamp offered by Brenda Moseid of 
Redondo Beach, is designed as an emergency light source. 
</P>
<P>
 The lamp has two fluorescent tubes that can operate together or independently. 
Once charged up, the lamp comes on automatically during a power failure. With 
one tube, the lamp runs for seven hours continuously; with both tubes on, it 
runs five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal lead-acid battery recharges in 24 hours. The lamp has a built-in 
charger that plugs into a wall outlet for intermittent or continuous 
recharging. The on-off switch is covered with rubber, so it's water-resistant. 
Lights On! ($59.95, plus shipping and handling) can be ordered by calling (800) 
200-4545.

DO-IT-YOUSELF: GET A LEG UP ON FIXING WOBBLY CHAIR JOINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A wobbly chair is more than a nuisance, it can be an accident waiting to 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Because a chair's strength depends on the firmness of all its joints, if one 
joint becomes loose the others receive extra stress that can loosen them also, 
possibly causing the chair to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Fixing wobbly chairs is usually easy if the problem is not too severe. But 
take antiques or fine contemporary chairs to a professional restorer; amateur 
repairs can lessen their value. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first sign of wobbling, examine a chair for the cause. If a joint is 
loose, try injecting glue into it with a glue syringe available at hardware 
stores. Use woodworking glue, technically called aliphatic resin glue. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid pulling the parts of the joint apart to inject the glue; this usually 
loosens other joints. If necessary, drill a small hole into the joint for the 
syringe's tip. Afterward, bind the chair parts firmly with string or rope or 
use a furniture clamp for about 18 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 To repair a loose chair rung, clamp the rung tightly in its socket and drill a 
quarter-inch-diameter hole at least two inches long through the chair leg and 
into the end of the rung. Apply glue to a dowel that has the same diameter as 
the hole. Hammer the dowel into place and then carefully saw it flush with the 
leg. Sand the dowel's end smooth and hide it with a dab of finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Gluing alone will not fill gaps between worn parts. If the socket of a joint 
is enlarged, try tightening it by packing bits of matchsticks, toothpicks or 
sawdust into the fresh glue. Never fix a wobbly joint by installing a nail or 
screw. Eventually the joint will loosen again and repairing it will be more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 If a chair part is broken or if the methods described above do not work, 
disassemble part or all of the chair to restore it. Remove any reinforcing 
nails, screws or braces (search for hidden ones covered with filler or wooden 
plugs); then tap the joints apart with a rubber mallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrape or sand old glue from the ends of the pieces and their sockets. Fatten 
a dowel or the stub end (called a tenon) of a rung by wrapping it with cotton 
thread or special metallic tape sold for the purpose. A liquid product is also 
available that swells wood fibers; it can be used in place of glue. 
</P>
<P>
 To make a square socket smaller, line it with a thin sliver of wood. To make a 
round socket smaller, plug it with glue and a tight-fitting dowel. When the 
glue hardens, saw the dowel flush with the surrounding wood and redrill a 
socket the correct size. 
</P>
<P>
 To repair a cracked part, gently pry open the split. Insert a toothpick or 
knife blade as a wedge, then apply woodworking glue with a small brush. Remove 
the wedge and squeeze the split several times until glue oozes from the crack 
on both sides, preferably along its entire length. 
</P>
<P>
 Wipe away the excess glue with a damp cloth or paper towel, then clamp the 
repair until the glue hardens. 
</P>
<P>
 If a chair wobbles because the legs are of different lengths, set it on a 
level surface to identify the faulty leg. Lengthen a short leg by fitting it 
with a furniture glide, saw off a small amount from a leg that is too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairs with padded seats set in a frame usually have reinforcing blocks where 
the legs meet the frame. If the blocks are wobbly, remove them, scrape away any 
old glue, and then reattach them with fresh glue and slightly larger screws.

GARDENING; BRIGHT NASTURTIUMS REALLY SEASON THE PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorful and flavorful nasturtiums, which are easy-to-grow annuals available 
as dwarf and tall cultivars, add a bright and cheery note to the garden. The 
peppery tang of their leaves and flowers lend a subtle seasoning to salads, 
savory dishes, soups, sandwiches and relishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The distinct, bright nasturtium flower is a garnish that is both lovely to 
look at and tasty to nibble. 
</P>
<P>
 The round leaves resemble miniature waterlilies and can be slipped under clear 
glass plates and platters to add color to the table. They are also a good 
source of vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwarf nasturtiums grow about 12 inches tall and are an excellent edging or 
bedding choice. They bear distinctive rounded leaves and yellow, orange, red or 
cream flowers. The tall nasturtium is a climber that grows between eight and 12 
feet high. It works best in a garden twined onto pergolas, trellises, fences 
and wire-gridded walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Both varieties have an extended blooming period. Nasturtiums grow best in cool 
weather but need sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 They are not particularly finicky about soil and will thrive even in poor 
soil, provided it is well-drained. 
</P>
<P>
 The trailing nature of nasturtiums means they will likely poach the territory 
of whatever is planted next to them. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is not what you have in mind, sow seeds directly into a window box or 
train them on trellises, fences and wire-meshed walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasturtium seeds are quite large. To germinate properly, they should be 
planted deep in the soil and receive lots of water and minimal light.

FURNISHINGS; HIGH TECH'S ON A ROLL IN ROCKING DESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving furniture takes on new meaning in these high-tech times. So does 
reupholstering it. 
</P>
<P>
 The former might range from a swaying bed to adjusting the height and depth of 
a favorite armchair. The latter might mean replacing the arm that Fido chewed 
rather than redoing the entire sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks to the universal appeal of being rocked to sleep, consumers have been 
very receptive to the idea of motion furniture for the bedroom," says Monty 
Thull, president of Swaymaster Swaybed in Toronto. "The motion is similar to 
that of a glider rocker or a porch swing." 
</P>
<P>
 The mattress and box spring are suspended by four heavy-duty springs from a 
tubular metal frame, complete with headboard and footboard. Chains curb the 
motion to a gentle sway. 
</P>
<P>
 The bed, $299 to $599 depending on size, is assembled at home with an Allen 
key and a small wrench included in the package. It is available in metallic 
finishes plus white, red and blue enamel. A wood version is on the drawing 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Thull says the bed is generally safe, but "we put a warning label on it to let 
parents know that kids shouldn't stand on the bed or get involved in a lot of 
horseplay." 
</P>
<P>
 Horseplay and pets may be reason enough to consider This End Up furniture in 
informal rooms. In its "Creative Collection," each element of a chair, sofa or 
love seat can be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point behind the quick-change possibilities is flexibility," says 
Caroline Hipple, vice president of the retail chain based in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the dog chews one arm, you can replace just that arm instead of having to 
recover the whole piece. Also, customers can order an additional cover for 
seasonal changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Other possibilities include changing the style of the arms or legs or seat 
back, or even the type of skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 For people long on overnight visitors but short on space, there's the 
Convertible Ottoman from Park Place Furniture of Greenville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-by-33-inch ottoman converts to a single bed, thanks to a metal frame 
that folds into three parts. The bed, also available in twin size, has an 
innerspring mattress atop a flat spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The ottoman, introduced at the spring furniture market in High Point, N.C., 
retails for about $499 in one of two fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Botero, a New York furniture designer, didn't have the average person in 
mind when he designed a new line of upholstered pieces. A slide mechanism 
allows the buyer to adjust seat depth and height as well as the pitch of the 
back on sofas, love seats and chairs. In stores by fall, prices are not yet 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 For home entertainment buffs, Botero put an electric outlet for recharging a 
laptop computer and storage space in the armrest for, say, a hand-held video 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 He also designed cabinets for home electronics. They're on casters for 
mobility with doors on front and back. The front doors hide the components when 
not in use, those in back offer easy access to all the cables and wires. 
</P>
<P>
 Botero designed not for the couch potato but for a "very active person who 
needs a lot of things around -- reading, computer, electronic games and home 
theater." 
</P>
<P>
 "As the communications highway becomes more of a reality," he says, "we have 
to have furniture to meet these needs."

GARDENING; PLANTS TAKE A POSITION ON SUNNY VS. SHADY SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE REICH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People with shady yards often have their own idea about what "full sun" and 
"part shade" mean. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend whose yard is surrounded by tall trees once planted a grapevine in 
what he called a sunny spot -- where the leafy tree canopy allowed a window of 
sunlight to peek through for about an hour at 12:30! 
</P>
<P>
 The grapevine grows, but produces just a few sour grapes. Grapes need full 
sun, and full sun means direct, unobstructed sunlight for at least six hours a 
day. This is the kind of exposure vegetable gardens, most fruit trees and many 
flowers require. 
</P>
<P>
 Some plants are adapted to shade when they are young, but require more light 
as they age. This is true of maples, beeches and other forest trees that start 
out as seedlings in the shade of existing forests, but eventually reach light 
and become the canopy itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Shade not only decreases flowering and fruiting of plants that need sun, but 
also causes their leaves and stems to become succulent. You put this to 
practical use when you block light from the stalks or leaves of celery or 
endive to make them more tender. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are plants that actually abhor full sunlight. African violet is 
native to shaded, tropical forests, and its leaves burn if exposed to full sun. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, shade-loving plants do not require shade itself, but, rather, 
the coolness and humidity of shade. Blueberries grow wild in the shade, but 
bear more berries if grown in full sun -- as long as their roots are kept moist 
and cool, with a thick mulch, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, you can extend your lettuce harvest into summer by covering the 
plants with either shade cloth or a frame made from strips of wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part shade" (or "part sun") occurs when a canopy of leaves blocks the sun, or 
when plants grow near enough to buildings to receive sun for only part of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 The east side of walls receives only morning sun, which is cool year-around 
and well-suited to broadleaf evergreens such as mahonia and rhododendron. Such 
plants would scorch against a west wall, which is more suited to thyme, 
potentilla, santolina and other plants that tolerate the hot fury of late 
afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Plants near north-facing walls receive diffuse light and, in summer, a bit 
each of early morning and late afternoon sun. This wall will be dark in winter, 
but as the days get longer the sun wraps more and more around the sky, shedding 
more direct light on the wall early and late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect increases with increasing latitude, and is how British gardeners 
get away with growing cherries as espaliers trained on north walls. (The 
coolness of the north wall also delays blossoming, so the flowers have an 
increased chance of escaping damaging late spring frosts.) 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be disappointed if you realize that some of your "full sun" is, in fact, 
"part shade." Plenty of plants enjoy the dappled play of sunlight through tree 
branches, or the coolness of northern or eastern walls. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, shade-lovers are represented by every category of plant: deciduous 
woody plants such as Juneberry, honeysuckle, dogwoods and witch hazels; 
evergreen woody plants such as mountain laurel, rhododendron, azalea, and 
euonymus; vines such as Boston and English ivy; perennial flowers such as 
bleeding heart, columbine, daisy, primrose and violets; and annual flowers such 
as impatiens and begonia. 
</P>
<P>
 There even are fruit trees that will produce in part shade. Persimmon and 
papaw tolerate dappled shade, and hardy kiwi fruits, gooseberries and currants 
actually enjoy it, especially where summers are hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Even dense shade need not hamper your gardening. Ferns and other woodland 
plants are especially adapted to such habitats, as are cultivated plants such 
as vinca. 
</P>
<P>
 There even are flowers to brighten up full shade: cardinal flower, day lily 
and bee balm.

O.C. ATTORNEY'S DIVIDED TIME ASSAILED BY JUDGES; COURTS: CRITICS SAY LAWYER 
WITH CONTRACT TO DEFEND INDIGENTS SPENDS MUCH OF HIS TIME IN SOUTH AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A local attorney who for 15 years has held one of the county's most lucrative 
contracts for representing indigents accused of crimes has come under attack by 
some Orange County judges who charge that he has all but abandoned his role in 
the courtroom but continues to share in the contract profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials confirm that attorney William W. Stewart sometimes 
communicates with the county court system by telephone or fax from his 
import-export business more than 3,000 miles away in Colombia, South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges say Stewart has been able to hold the contract and tend to his 
far-flung business interests by "sub-letting" hundreds of indigent cases to 
other criminal lawyers who share in the annual fees, which can range from 
$700,000 to nearly $1 million.  
</P>
<P>
 County officials said Friday the complaints -- which include concerns about 
delays in getting Stewart's attorneys to court -- have prompted them to launch 
a review of Stewart's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy is shipping cases around the county and gets a couple hundred 
thousand dollars for doing nothing," an angry Municipal Judge Margaret R. 
Anderson said this week during a judges' meeting, during which the handling of 
indigent cases was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Stewart acknowledged that he has not appeared in court "as often as I 
would like to in the past four years," but defended his firm and his other 
contract attorneys as having provided the county and indigent clients with an 
"excellent level of service." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart took particular exception to criticisms of his South American 
interests in a lobster and flower import/export business, saying that 
out-of-country travel has not interfered with his management of the contract, 
which involved about 1,270 criminal misdemeanor and felony cases last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What business is it of theirs what I do with my time as long as the contract 
services are being fulfilled? I don't know where the hell she is coming from," 
he said, referring to Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy comes at a time when the county is locked in a raging debate 
over how to lower the cost of providing attorneys for people who cannot afford 
their own lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures released this week show that Orange County has paid $2.6 million to 
private attorneys to handle 99 murder cases which were completed last year. At 
roughly $27,237 per homicide case, the bill is about $8,000 less than what Los 
Angeles County pays for the typical murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials are nonetheless looking at reducing costs in homicide and other 
criminal cases where private defense attorneys are required. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office generally handles the defense of indigents, but 
in criminal cases where there is more than one defendant or the office has 
declared other conflicts of interest, those cases are delegated to private 
attorneys under contract to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1979, Stewart's firm has held the contract for conflict cases 
originating in the county's court system in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The indigent-defense debate hit a boiling point Wednesday during a meeting of 
the county's Alternate Defense Steering Committee, which is considering a new 
policy for contract attorneys on indigent defense cases. The committee makes 
policy recommendations to the Board of Supervisors. Member include judges from 
all of the county's court systems. 
</P>
<P>
 At that meeting, criticisms of Stewart's contract performance were aired by 
some committee members, specifically Anderson and Municipal Judge Pamela L. 
Iles. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges' criticisms have sparked a review of Stewart's court operations by 
county budget office, while Municipal Judge Gregory H. Lewis in Santa Ana said 
separate plans are underway to address recent delays in getting contract 
attorneys in court for various mandated appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The service is off and on," Lewis said. "We might have various pretrial 
hearings that are delayed because of the unavailability of an attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson and Iles, however, centered their criticism on Stewart's practice of 
farming cases to outside attorneys and its potential for blurring the 
contractor's accountability for the cases assigned to his firm. Stewart said 
six attorneys from his firm and six in outside practices handle the caseload 
under the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's volatile meeting, John Palacio, a leader of the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, questioned whether Stewart's firm 
was more concerned about profits than the welfare of his indigent clients.  
</P>
<P>
 "This points up the need to better manage how these contracts are let out," he 
told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Superior Court Executive Officer Alan Slater cautioned the group against 
such harsh judgments of Stewart's performance, saying that nothing in the 
contract prohibited him from using outside attorneys to handle the caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big contract and it has always required multiple attorneys," Slater 
said Friday. "But sometimes attorneys change and judges change and it takes 
some time to settle." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater acknowledged that Santa Ana judges have become concerned recently about 
delays in getting the contract attorneys to court for various court 
appearances. As a result, Judge Lewis said a system is being considered that 
would assign cases to Stewart and two other firms on a daily rotation basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, the presiding judge in the Santa Ana court where Stewart operates, 
described the quality of outside legal representation as "excellent," but "we 
need more coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Slater and Lewis said they were aware of Stewart's outside business 
interests. Slater said he sometimes receives an occasional fax or phone call 
from Colombia, but had little difficulty in maintaining communications with 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't initially get him on the telephone, he'll call back from wherever 
he is within a day," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis characterized Stewart's out-of-country business as a "medium worry" in a 
contract that requires constant communications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is a serious impediment right now," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Coley, who handles court management and budget issues for the county 
administrative office, said Stewart's contract "sure has our attention. 
Obviously this is a concern to us." 
</P>
<P>
 County Budget Director Fred A. Branca said the Stewart matter had been 
discussed internally and there were plans to review how the court's business 
was being conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been assured by Alan Slater that whatever is being conducted is in 
compliance with the contract," Branca said. "I'm not sure what this is all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said the criticism is part of plan to discredit him and possibly 
position another firm to take over the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing this for many, many years without a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Anderson, who sits on the Municipal Court bench in Newport Beach, and 
Iles, who is assigned to Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel, have no experience 
with his firm's performance in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where the hell they are coming from," Stewart said. "They don't 
know about the real business world and how business gets done, but they are 
more than happy to speak up." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart acknowledged the judges' concerns about the unavailability of 
attorneys in some cases. But he said they were no more serious than the "holes" 
in availability of prosecutors during tight budget times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, I spoiled those courts in years past," Stewart said. "We used 
to flood the courts with attorneys. But these are tough economic times."

 EASY ROCKING: Tragic as the numbers are, officials say that 40% of the newborn 
babies sent to the Orangewood Children's Home show traces of drugs -- usually 
heroin or cocaine -- passed on from their mothers. But the Orange Blossom 
Volunteers, who help raise funds for the children's home in Orange, have 
purchased a cradle built just for drug-addicted babies. Says spokeswoman 
Shelley Westmore: "It comforts newborns experiencing withdrawal symptoms by 
simulating life in the womb." The volunteer group is trying to raise funds to 
buy 10 of the cradles.

 ELEPHANT WALK: Here's a chance for instant stardom for someone: Mike Fenton, 
casting director for "The Godfather" and "E.T.," will hold a casting call 
Sunday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., at Westminster's Viet and World Magazine, 14922 
Moran St. . . . He wants just one boy -- between 11 and 14 -- for the movie 
"Operation Dumbo Drop," to be filmed soon in Thailand. In the movie, the young 
actor would take control of an elephant in Vietnam. Says a spokeswoman: "We 
need a smart and brave young man."

 BOX OF MERCEDES? For years, Yvette Berke kept the Walt Disney Co. a leader in 
recycling. She once put on a Disneyland promotion handing out T-shirts recycled 
from its drinking cups. . . . Now a consultant based in Newport Beach, she's 
spreading the recycling word on her own, even showing corporate leaders how 
they can help the environment by using paper clips recycled from used car 
steel. "The corporate world is catching on about recycling," she says. "But 
there's still so much more it could be doing." 
</P>
<P>
 NEWPORT GREEN? It can pay to be environmentally correct. Newport Beach plans 
to honor local businesses who have a "green attitude" -- meaning good 
environmental programs. . . . City spokesman Ed Hepner says he hopes the new 
commendations will help businesses learn from each other: "Anybody who has seen 
all the garbage in the Upper Back Bay knows that a beach city must be sensitive 
to this issue."

TACO BELL TO STAY IN IRVINE; BUSINESS: BIG REDUCTION IN RENT AND $4 MILLION IN 
REMODELING AT HEADQUARTERS WINS OUT OVER TEXAS BID. DECISION SAVES 1,000 JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Marking an important symbolic victory for California's efforts to keep 
businesses from leaving the state, Taco Bell Corp. announced Friday that it has 
abandoned a yearlong nationwide search for a headquarters site elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Offered half-price on its office rent and a $4-million remodeling package by 
its hard-pressed Japanese landlord, Taco Bell said it would stay in the same 
12-story headquarters in Orange County that it had earlier declared to be too 
small for its expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's decision to stay in Irvine brought cheers and high-fives from the 
1,000 anxious employees and full-time contract workers who gathered in the huge 
employee restaurant early Friday to hear the news. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement by Orange County's sixth-largest employer was hailed as a 
boost to the state's efforts to convince corporate executives around the 
country that California is becoming more friendly to business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are delighted," Gov. Pete Wilson said. "We think that is very, very good 
news, first and foremost because this is a very good and aggressive company 
with very realistic but very exciting plans for future growth. They are also of 
symbolic importance in that we are specifically trying to woo corporate 
headquarters in California." 
</P>
<P>
 A team of state and local government officials as well as corporate leaders 
had scrambled to keep Taco Bell in California for fear that its departure would 
make a dispiriting statement about the state's ability to keep even 
white-collar headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican-style, fast-food chain said that it was too expensive to build a 
new headquarters elsewhere in Orange County or in Texas, where it was eyeing 
property in the north Dallas suburb of Plano. Texas had aggressively sought to 
lure Taco Bell with $10 million in tax breaks as well as the standard fare: no 
personal income tax, inexpensive land and less onerous government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell chose to stay even though a committee of the state Legislature 
earlier this month rejected a bill that would have provided tax credits to 
large corporations that moved into California or expanded. Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown, who authored the bill, expressed optimism about pushing through 
some corporate tax relief this year, a factor that he said may have helped to 
persuade Taco Bell to remain. Taco Bell on Friday called on lawmakers to pass 
the tax legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to remain in Orange County is "a major victory . . . more 
symbolic than actual," Brown said. "If we had lost them, it would have just 
been another nail in the coffin. We're slowly but surely reversing the 
perception that companies ought to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials also were elated about the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tremendously satisfying victory," said Orange County Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley. "We spent a lot of time talking with them. I'm very proud of 
what the city, the county and the state did here." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Mayor Michael Ward said the decision shows that "the political winds in 
California have changed, and leaders are realizing that they not only have to 
court business to move to the state but they also have to court those who are 
already here to remain." 
</P>
<P>
 The public officials also applauded H. Fred Mickelson, a Southern California 
Edison executive who led the so-called "red team" in its efforts to keep Taco 
Bell in the state. Red teams are ad hoc groups of public officials and business 
executives that gather as needed to try to head off companies considering 
moving out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson said the team's efforts to keep Taco Bell should serve as "fair 
warning to other states that we're drawing a line in the sand and will fight to 
the death to keep our companies here." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees, nervous about their job prospects, were jubilant over the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an emotional thing that's been hanging on forever," said Tim Johnson, 
who designs the signs and image of Taco Bell restaurants. "The rumor mill has 
been rampant, and so there's a great deal of relief now." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Tapas, an administrative specialist for Taco Bell, said she almost 
cried when she heard the news. "It would've broke my heart if we left," she 
said. "My family is from Sweden and they love coming out here. The first thing 
they want to do when they visit is go to Taco Bell." 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell Chief Executive John E. Martin had long said that the company 
preferred to stay in California but needed room to grow and a sympathetic 
political and business environment. The company had forecast a doubling of its 
headquarters staff by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Erecting a larger headquarters structure in Orange County was considered, but 
on Friday the company officially rejected that idea because the "economics of 
building a new facility just didn't make sense in today's environment." 
</P>
<P>
 The rental concessions granted Taco Bell by its landlord, Shuwa Investments 
Corp, come at a time when the slumping real estate market is wreaking havoc on 
the Tokyo-based firm. The beleaguered real estate investment company had 
borrowed heavily to expand its portfolio of properties in the 1980s, at the 
height of the market. Fearful of losing a major tenant, Shuwa offered Taco Bell 
rock-bottom rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new 15-year deal, Taco Bell will pay a monthly rent of $1.50 a square 
foot for the first five-year period beginning next Feb. 1, said a Shuwa 
executive who requested anonymity. The chain's current rent, on a lease that 
would have expired in November, 1996, is about $2.85 a square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 After five and 10 years, rent for the company headquarters increases or the 
company can end the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell, which now occupies 280,000 square feet in the high-rise and a floor 
in a smaller adjacent building, may later be able to lease up to four 
additional floors in a nearby building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are delighted to continue to call California our home," Martin added. "The 
creative spark, energy level and employee talent base that exists here will 
enable Taco Bell to maintain its tremendous growth momentum in the years 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and other Taco Bell executives declined Friday to comment on their 
decision beyond issuing a press release. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, in what is believed to be an unrelated action, will move its 
accounting processing functions in August to the Albuquerque suburb of Rio 
Rancho. The company will move 15 employees there and give 45 others a chance to 
apply for Taco Bell jobs in Irvine. The company expects to hire up to 90 people 
in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also made a change in top management Friday by giving Martin the 
newly createdpost of chairman and turning over his position as president to 
Kenneth T. Stevens, an executive vice president. Martin remains chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell quietly began its search for a new headquarters a year ago. The 
company wanted to build its own corporate headquarters -- preferably a series 
of interconnecting low-rise buildings arranged in a campus-like atmosphere with 
room to grow to 600,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The company gathered a team of experts, including Cushman Realty Corp. real 
estate agents and Gensler & Associates architects to search the nation for a 
new headquarters site. 
</P>
<P>
 By late fall, the team was concentrating on sites in and around Atlanta and 
Charlotte, N.C., as well as Orange County and Dallas-Ft. Worth. The Orange 
County sites included the Irvine Spectrum, Rancho Santa Margarita and two 
locations on either side of UC Irvine, one promoted by the university and the 
other by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI submitted a proposal to Taco Bell in February for a campus-like 
headquarters as part of a planned $150-million corporate park, which would 
include 300 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Business and political leaders in Atlanta and Charlotte tried hard to attract 
the company, but Taco Bell decided in early March to drop those areas and 
downtown Dallas from its list. Later, the company scratched downtown Ft. Worth 
and nearby Circle T Ranch, a business and residential project owned by H. Ross 
Perot Jr., son of the 1992 presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of March, the search had been narrowed to the Irvine Spectrum and 
the Legacy business park in Plano. 
</P>
<P>
 A last-ditch effort by California was mounted March 28 in a meeting at Irvine 
City Hall. It was the biggest gathering of local and state officials and 
business leaders to meet with Taco Bell executives. Gov. Wilson three days 
earlier had talked with Martin by telephone, urging him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said later that until that meeting, the company was "this close" to 
moving to Texas, but California officials "got religion" and began to offer 
inducements to keep the company here. The biggest potential lure was Assembly 
leader Brown's effort to legislate a 6% tax credit for companies relocating 
headquarters or expanding existing California headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Few states could match the package of incentives that Texas offered along with 
its lower living costs and business-friendly laws. A $10-million package of tax 
credits and other inducements for Taco Bell included about $4.5 million in 
property tax relief over 10 years and the suspension of permit and developer 
fees.  
</P>
<P>
 Though the tax incentives proposed in the California legislation fall short of 
the offer from Texas, the estimated $20-million cost of relocating to the 
Dallas area and the hassle of replacing staff members who did not move -- along 
with the deal from Shuwa -- were enough to keep Taco Bell in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Eric Bailey in Sacramento and Debora Vrana in Costa Mesa 
contributed to this report. No Run for the Border 
</P>
<P>
 After a yearlong search, Taco Bell announced that it isn't pulling up stakes 
after all. The firm's corporate headquarters is staying in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 What Decision Means 
</P>
<P>
 Saves 1,000 jobs 
</P>
<P>
 County keeps a non-polluting industry 
</P>
<P>
 County retains approximately $50 million in wages and tax revenue 
</P>
<P>
 Local charities continue to receive Taco Bell contributions, which average 
hundreds of thousands of dollars annually 
</P>
<P>
 280,000 square feet of office space remains occupied 
</P>
<P>
 "In short, it's very good economic news." -- Gov. Pete Wilson 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe our decision is in the best interests of our employees and 
shareholders alike." -- John E. Martin, Taco Bell chairman and CEO

TACO BELL DECISION: STAY IN O.C.; ELATED WORKERS JOIN CHORUS CHEERING 
EXECUTIVES' CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 After a year of uncertainty and anxiety, employees of Taco Bell Corp. and 
government and civic leaders throughout the state collectively cheered the 
fast-food chain's decision Friday to keep its headquarters -- and about 1,000 
jobs -- in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very good economic news," said Gov. Pete Wilson, who became involved in 
a bipartisan state and local effort to dissuade the PepsiCo. subsidiary from 
leaving, thereby avoiding the economic and image damage of having another major 
corporation flee the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts included introduction in Sacramento of a bill to provide tax and 
other incentives to California-based corporations that want to stay and expand 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 While that measure has not yet been passed, Wilson said Taco Bell received "a 
great deal of help at the local level in terms of permits, in terms of 
involvement of local government in trying to retain them." 
</P>
<P>
 At least as happy as the politicians were the workers whose lives would have 
been disrupted had the company decided to move to Texas, as it had been 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executives had told workers of the decision to stay during a morning 
meeting and several leaving the gathering said they had been worried at the 
prospect of pulling up Southern California roots and selling their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is fantastic news, especially since I surf a lot. And Taco Bell is a 
Southern California company," said Tim Johnson, who crafts the signs and image 
of Taco Bell restaurants. "A lot of the design and company philosophy is 
inherently Southern Californian."  
</P>
<P>
 Annette Jaffee, a Laguna Beach resident who is marketing manager for the 
company, said the announcement "was a surprise, but I was happy we'll stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Local economic development officials and politicians rejoiced as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge win for Orange County, as it means keeping 1,000 high-paying 
jobs," said H. Fred Mickelson, a Southern California Edison executive and head 
of the special public-private team formed to negotiate with Taco Bell. 
"High-caliber jobs mean employees buying goods and services in Orange County, 
from cars and food to entertainment."  
</P>
<P>
 Equally happy were the many vendors and contractors who do business with Taco 
Bell: The company's departure would have meant a substantial loss of revenue to 
most of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted that California negotiated with them," said Anaheim marketing 
consultant Cathi Hofstetter, who oversees consumer product tests for the Taco 
Bell. "It would have impacted my business if they moved away." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the upbeat mood in California, officials were understandably glum in 
Plano, Texas. Texas had aggressively sought to lure the company with $10 
million in tax breaks as inherent amenities, such as no personal income tax, 
inexpensive land and less onerous government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole Morvand, executive director of the Plano Economic Development Office, 
said he was disappointed about Taco Bell's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're in California, it's a great day," he said. "We felt confident we 
would win until today. We were certainly aggressive and did what we thought was 
fair for the company and the city."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, as Morvand pointed out, Taco Bell's new lease in Irvine can be canceled 
in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe then we will try again," he said. 
</P>

and Times correspondents Alan Eyerly and Lynn Franey contributed to this 
report.

TACO BELL DECISION: STAY IN O.C.; REAL ESTATE SLUMP HELPED CHAIN GET 
'SWEETHEART DEAL'; LEASE: LANDLORD SLASHES RENT, TOSSES IN $4 MILLION FOR 
IMPROVEMENTS AND OFFERS FREE PARKING TO KEEP TENANT. 
</P>

<P>
 Taco Bell Corp. officials' decision to stay in the same 12-story mirrored 
office tower they've occupied for eight years was largely due to a sweetheart 
deal wrested from a landlord already reeling from the real estate slump, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new lease, which starts early next year, Taco Bell stands to slash 
more than $350,000 a month from its rent costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 280,000-square-foot building's Tokyo-based owner, Shuwa Investments Corp., 
was "bending over backward to get them to stay, especially since there's no 
other company really hanging around wanting to use that space," said Louis 
Masotti, director of the real estate management program at UC Irvine. "Shuwa is 
a winner here but so is Taco Bell -- they got a great deal." 
</P>
<P>
 While complete details of the deal were not released, Shuwa and Taco Bell 
reportedly signed a 15-year lease at a 66% discount in the first few years. It 
allows Taco Bell to end the lease at the end of five and 10-year periods. Shuwa 
also gave Taco Bell $4 million in cash or rent credits for building 
improvements and isn't charging the company for parking, a Shuwa executive 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuwa agreed to an early cancellation of Taco Bell's current 10-year lease, 
which isn't set to expire until November, 1996. The company pays $2 a square 
foot a month in net rental rates under the current lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sweetheart deal," one local real estate watcher said of the new lease. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new lease, which begins Feb. 1, monthly net rent is 67 cents a 
square foot in the first five years, rising to 83 cents a foot in the second 
five-year term and once again to $1 a month in the third five-year period if 
Taco Bell renews. 
</P>
<P>
 The rates exclude taxes and building operations costs. In the first five-year 
term they would add about 83 cents a square foot, for total gross rent of $1.50 
a foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross monthly rates in the area for high-rise office space average about $1.65 
a square foot, according to Grubb & Ellis Co., a real estate brokerage firm.  
</P>
<P>
 "Taco Bell got a very good price," said Dennis Macheski, director of real 
estate research at the Costa Mesa office of the Price Waterhouse accounting 
firm. "And rents right now are rising, so they got a price you could not have 
gotten a year and a half ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuwa's dilemma is one shared by many office building owners in the United 
States, where rents have plummeted after a boom in the 1980s. Japanese 
investment companies, hit hard by a real estate crash in their own country, are 
especially hard pressed. Like many of its contemporaries in Japan, Shuwa went 
on a U.S. buying binge in the 1980s, snapping up so-called trophy properties 
like Arco Towers in downtown Los Angeles and the ABC Building in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Shuwa is reportedly sagging under the burden of repaying principal and 
interest on accumulated debt estimated at $8.5 billion. To raise $204 million 
to help repay its debts, the firm this year sold a significant portion of the 
stock it owned in a major Tokyo-based department store. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the real estate market slump, Shuwa is no stranger to bare-knuckle 
lease negotiations. In January, 1993, the company renegotiated a lease 
transaction valued at $115 million with Bank of America, which threatened to 
abandon Shuwa's Arco Towers building in downtown Los Angeles. The lease was 
renegotiated at a savings to the bank to keep it in the 470,000 square feet of 
office and retail space. 
</P>
<P>
 Several real estate experts said Shuwa, with a bottom-line incentive to 
renegotiate, was working hard to keep Taco Bell as a high-profile tenant, 
offering a deal the fast-food company couldn't match anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given what's going on in the Japanese real estate market, Shuwa could not 
afford to have another empty office building on the market," Masotti said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Koll Co., the Irvine-based commercial real estate firm that 
constructed the Shuwa building and which owns properties that surround it, were 
tight-lipped about any role Koll may have had in persuading Taco Bell to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 But several sources said Koll had offered Taco Bell space nearby in the Shuwa 
building as a way to allow Taco Bell to both expand and remain where it is. And 
it is clear that Taco Bell was working with Koll in some capacity, possibly to 
do rehabilitation for the building.

FILM SCHOOL TO SAVE A PLACE FOR INMATE; SCHOLARSHIP: TEEN-AGER WHO WON CONTEST 
WITH AN ANTI-DRUG VIDEO WILL GET TO COLLECT HER PRIZE -- A WORKSHOP AT USC -- 
AFTER SHE SERVES HER TIME FOR AUTO THEFT. 
</P>

 Film school can wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at USC's School of Cinema-Television say they have decided to defer 
the scholarship prize for a Ventura County juvenile inmate's winning anti-drug 
video until after she is released next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, officials had expressed uncertainty over whether Wendy Creiglow, a 
16-year-old from San Diego County serving time for grand theft auto at the 
California Youth Authority's Ventura School, would be allowed to collect the 
prize -- a five-week workshop at the film school -- for her video, "Flatlines." 
</P>
<P>
 The CYA was unwilling to release her early, saying she had not completed her 
rehabilitation and would be ineligible for release until next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 And the USC faculty judges were not sure whether they could guarantee Wendy a 
slot next summer after granting this year's slot to the runner-up video maker 
from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, film school officials announced they will hold Wendy's 
scholarship until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of the judges of the Teens Making a Difference competition, run by USC 
and KCET-TV, could be reached Friday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the school released a statement saying, "The University of Southern 
California-School of Cinema and Television wishes to reassure Ms. Wendy 
Creiglow that her inability to participate in our program this summer in no way 
prohibits her from participating next year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It concluded, "The university is committed to fostering new talent and fully 
intends to hold Ms. Creiglow's scholarship until summer, 1995, when she is able 
to attend." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy, who was being videotaped Friday afternoon for a panel discussion on 
KCET's "Life and Times" program, could not be reached for comment on the 
judges' decision. The video, written by Creiglow and produced by fellow inmates 
at the school, warns that drugs can kill. In graphic close-ups, it equates 
lines of cocaine with the profile of a gun and the flat-line readout of an 
overdose victim's pulse on a heart monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 CYA officials said they are glad she will have the chance to use the $4,500 
scholarship in an intensive, five-week filmmaking workshop at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Youth Authority's very proud of this young woman," said Sarah Andrade, a 
spokeswoman for California's juvenile prison system. "This is a wonderful 
accomplishment, and there's no way we would want her to miss this."

CHP CITES DISTRICT FOR POOR SCHOOL BUS UPKEEP; TRANSPORTATION: OFFICIALS ARE 
THREATENED WITH CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR FAILURE TO CONDUCT REGULAR INSPECTIONS AND 
KEEP UP-TO-DATE RECORDS AT VAN NUYS FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District has failed to properly maintain school 
buses and drivers' records at its Van Nuys garage, according to the California 
Highway Patrol, which has threatened busing officials with a criminal 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The 315-bus garage has been cited for violating strict state laws that call 
for school buses to be inspected every 45 days or 3,000 miles. Drivers have 
also been lax in submitting accurate daily reports on bus condition, CHP 
inspectors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, district bus garages in San Pedro and Downtown also were 
cited for having outdated driver certification records. Those violations have 
since been corrected, the CHP said, and the district has conducted a new 
training program for all bus drivers and mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP characterized the problems with the district's 1,800-vehicle bus fleet 
-- the largest such operation in the nation -- as more of a management problem 
than a mechanical one. Overall, authorities did not find gross mechanical 
defects in recent annual inspections and said parents should not be alarmed 
about their children's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But the poor record-keeping and maintenance schedules at the Van Nuys facility 
for the second consecutive year raised an alarm in April, CHP authorities said. 
The district was given 90 days to correct the violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like the tires are ready to fall off the buses," said Officer Rick 
Meier, the CHP's school safety coordinator. "These are items that, if left 
unnoticed or left unknown, could go ahead and turn into a serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Tomiyama, the district's director of transportation, said he was 
confident that the problems have been fixed and that inspectors will soon give 
a satisfactory rating to the Van Nuys garage.  
</P>
<P>
 As many as five mechanics and drivers are in the midst of disciplinary action 
for failing to follow state maintenance laws, he said, and some staff members 
have been shifted to keep better track of drivers' records. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very serious, extremely serious," Tomiyama said. "It's safety, 
safety, safety first. Because we are entrusted with the public safety of 
children we have to ensure that our buses are in the safest possible condition 
and our drivers are the safest as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 If the district does not pass a reinspection next month, the CHP wrote in its 
April report, it will seek a criminal complaint with the Los Angeles County 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 50-year history of the district's massive bus operation, no student 
passenger has been killed in an accident, Tomiyama said. Although statistics 
were not readily available, he said the most common accident involves buses 
striking children.  
</P>
<P>
 CHP inspectors, who surveyed a random sampling of buses at the Van Nuys 
facility, cited the district for violations primarily dealing with preventive 
maintenance. Buses were not being inspected on schedule and drivers were not 
submitting daily bus condition reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most serious mechanical problems, several bus drivers improperly 
elevated their seats. If the bus were to hit a hard bump, there is a strong 
likelihood that the seat would break away from the floor and possibly cause the 
driver to lose control, inspectors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems at the Van Nuys facility appear symptomatic of wider district 
transportation troubles in record-keeping and communication between mechanics 
and bus drivers, CHP authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, inspections found that bus drivers' licenses and certification 
records were not being kept up to date. This prompted the CHP to issue an 
unsatisfactory rating for all six district garages. The others have been 
cleared in reinspections. 
</P>
<P>
 To correct the problems, the district and the CHP embarked on a series of 
training seminars -- ending last week -- where CHP officers were called in to 
review state laws with about 1,500 bus drivers and mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 Meier said the district needs to tighten its chain of command and 
accountability in areas of bus maintenance so that workers are not able to 
shift blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say they need to look at who is responsible for what," Meier said. 
Big-Time Busing 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District operates the largest school bus system 
in the nation. The figures below include both district-owned buses and 
contracted bus services. Buses: 2,500 Students transported: 80,000 Routes: 
2,200 Annual milage: 40 million Gallons of gas: 3.2 million

SOMEONE TO LOOK UP TO; A DOUBLE AMPUTEE TEACHES PRESCHOOLERS LESSON IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Nobody was standing taller than Judy Richter as the school term ended Friday 
for one group of children in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old East Los Angeles woman's artwork decorated the walls and hung 
from the curtain above the auditorium stage at 66th Street School. 
</P>
<P>
 Down in front, two dozen preschoolers wore elephant ears, cardboard top hats, 
and bow ties made to fit by her. Out in the audience, about 60 parents and 
relatives clutched commencement invitations and programs that she had designed. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder that before the children and the adults adjourned for pizza and 
punch, they clamored around the wheelchair to have their pictures taken with 
Richter. 
</P>
<P>
 A double amputee from the pelvis down, Richter spent the school year working 
as a volunteer classroom aide. And along the way, she ended up teaching a 
lesson to parents and teachers -- as well as the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not ashamed of the way I look," said Richter, who lost one leg at age 13 
and the other four years later. "People may stare at first. But when they get 
to know me I look natural to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Richter lost her limbs to a congenital disorder called atriovenous 
malformation. It is a rare disease that affects blood vessels and, in Richter's 
case, caused infection in her legs, according to Dr. Jose Terz, one of her 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was either amputation or not live," said Richter. "It was not a choice." 
</P>
<P>
 She spent a year in the hospital after the second surgery. A depressing 12 
months followed that. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a year I just wanted to be in my house," she remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 A therapist counseled her to use artificial legs so as not to attract 
attention in public. But Richter found the prostheses to be uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 She enrolled in trade school and graduated with a certificate in architectural 
drawing. But when it came time to interview for jobs, Richter had difficulty 
traveling to them without a car. 
</P>
<P>
 She was living at the home of her mother, Maggie Richter, when she fell into 
her volunteer school work by accident two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sister, Martha Iniguez, was working as a preschool educational aide at 
66th Street School and asked Richter if she could hurriedly do a flyer needed 
in the classroom the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Her artwork was a hit and Iniguez brought her more rush projects. Finally, she 
cajoled Richter into accompanying her to the campus at 6600 S. San Pedro St. 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was nervous coming the first time. There were no ramps here or anything," 
recalled Iniguez, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Others at the school, which has 1,169 children on a year-round schedule, were 
surprised to see her. Some worried what children and parents would think about 
someone with no legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to expect. But any preconceived ideas I had left me when I 
met her," said Principal Carmen Garner. 
</P>
<P>
 Preschool teacher Norma Frazier, whom Richter assisted for three hours each 
school day this spring, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first you're in instant shock -- I'd never seen a person like that," 
Frazier said. "I could tell right away she was self-sufficient. I just let the 
kids handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 The children accepted Richter instantly. "They stare at first," she said. "But 
after I play with them, they get used to the way I look. They accept me for 
what I am." 
</P>
<P>
 When the more curious children asked Richter what happened to her legs, she 
sometimes turned her answer into a safety lesson instead of a complicated 
medical explanation: "You know how people can get hurt if they get hit by car? 
Remember, don't play in the street," she would say. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the children forgot that the smiling lady racing around the campus in 
the wheelchair had no legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids never talked about her having a handicap," confirmed Rosa Iniguez, 
whose 4-year-old daughter, Marina, attended the preschool class. "In fact, I 
was surprised the first time I saw her." 
</P>
<P>
 Said parent Michele Samusick, whose son Victor also is in the class: "My son 
never said a word about it. She's taught the children a valuable lesson -- they 
won't discriminate against people with handicaps when they get older." 
</P>
<P>
 Richter helped Garner and Frazier present certificates to the 27 children 
against the backdrop of a 10-foot-wide banner decorated with cutout animals 
that Richter created for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 She laughed when she described how she assembled the colorful tiger, giraffe, 
elephant, crocodile and butterfly artwork on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I scoot around on one of those boards that mechanics lie on under cars," she 
said. "Sometimes I have to remind people to watch it, that I'm down here." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happens when you're accepted.

 I always wanted to be a princess. And if not a princess, a debutante. Minimal 
schooling required. One must be well coiffed at all times and know the 
difference between a salad fork and a soup spoon. White dresses are not a 
preference, but a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 But somewhere between preteen and puberty the desire left. "White Gloves and 
Party Manners" was forsaken for "On the Road," and Chanel gave way to patchouli 
oil. Cotillion? The closest I came was dating a slam dancer named Tufty. 
</P>
<P>
 And then came the Los Angeles Blue Book, a historic tome published annually 
and named for its regal blue leather cover, which is adorned with frilly gilded 
script. The register is filled with the who's who of left-coast bluebloods, 
from yacht club members to museum trustees, Phi Beta Kappas to countesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has someone with my exact same name -- Laura Anne Galloway.

 It is a rich man's telephone book that would make Hedda Hopper salivate from

</P>
<P>
 The book was started in 1917 by William Hord Richardson, a member of Los 
Angeles high society who made his fortune in real estate. Upon his death in 
1969, duties shifted to his wife, Luisa Hord Richardson, who has been the 
editor and publisher up through the printing this year of its final edition. (A 
key staff member died and the work had gotten to be too much, Mrs. Richardson 
explained.) 
</P>
<P>
 Until its demise with the 1994 issue, the book was funded by a $40 fee paid 
annually by those listed. But not just anyone could become a member of the 
Southland gentry. Inclusion was by invitation only, with old members 
recommending new entries each year. Efforts were also made to distribute the 
book only among the listed, although an occasional copy strayed. Ahem. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus to happen across a copy of the Blue Book seemed an act of fate. And the 
chances of finding two Laura Anne Galloways, let alone two who spelled their 
middle name with an E, seemed about as likely as finding a Hells Angel at 
afternoon tea. A call to my namesake was in order; after all, it was the 
socially correct thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For three days I planned out my initial conversation with the other Laura Anne 
Galloway. The possibilities seemed endless: perhaps a meeting at Le Dome, gin 
and tonics over a stimulating conversation regarding our lineage and the merits 
of crinoline over taffeta. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Laura, who no doubt was well connected, would be so impressed with 
me, her fellow Laura Anne, that she would extend an invitation to join an 
exclusive social circle, where I would undoubtedly meet my future husband: a 
member of the British Royal Family, perhaps, or maybe a James Bond type. 
</P>
<P>
 We settled not on Le Dome, but a coffee shop in La Canada Flintridge. Instead 
of gin and tonic, the sweet-faced brunette daintily sipped a chocolate 
milkshake, sharing bits of information about her life with the grace of a 
princess. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been dating an older man lately, a relationship that is conducted with 
her mother's full approval. She'd been to Paris just a few months earlier, and 
greatly enjoyed the experience that France afforded her. And, as should be the 
case with anyone who shares my full name, Laura loves to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 They were all expected activities for the beautiful, friendly other Laura Anne 
Galloway, with a few possible exceptions. The older man is a junior in high 
school; the trip to Paris was with her high school band. And most of the 
shopping is done at the Glendale Galleria, or, as she will tell you, "Wherever 
my friends will drive." 
</P>
<P>
 You see, the other Laura Anne Galloway is only 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Young Laura doesn't think much about the Blue Book -- she was in fact unaware 
that it existed until her mother, who joined us, explained what it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Laura is interested in outer space, but she hasn't made any career 
choices yet. After all, she is only a sophomore, and there is plenty of time. 
</P>
<P>
 She has considered becoming a debutante, something that both her mother and 
sister did. But it is not as much for the tradition as the mandatory community 
service, an idea that appeals to her very much. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Anne Galloway, explains the merits of being a debutante in this 
way: "If you should ever need the formality, you would feel very comfortable in 
any setting. This generation is more of a casual generation. Should the 
pendulum swing back, and you get to a table with six forks and five spoons, 
you'll know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Just think: Had I been given the chance, my habit of using steak knives for 
buttering bread would have ended years ago, and I could have proudly added 
spectator pumps to my footwear collection (now mostly Keds). 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it didn't matter much that young Laura Anne Galloway did not know 
Prince Charles, that she did not belong to an exclusive club or that she wore 
cotton instead of crepe. Because, as Laura Anne Galloway showed me, it's not 
who you know, but who you are.

VENTURA MAY SOON HEAR CLANG OF TROLLEY; ATTRACTIONS: CITY WILL CONSIDER A 
FRANCHISE THAT COULD BRING A LINE TO THE DOWNTOWN, HARBOR AND PIER AREAS BY THE 
END OF NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 By Friday, there may be a new sight on the streets of Ventura: An 
old-fashioned trolley, chugging its way between the harbor, the pier and 
downtown, carrying what merchants and city leaders hope will be a carload of 
tourists flush with money to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday will consider approving a franchise with the 
contractor that runs the Ojai and Santa Barbara trolleys. If the council gives 
its OK, the trolley could be up and running as soon as July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Warren, president of the Downtown Merchants Assn., can already envision the 
trolley rumbling down California Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll hear that bell ding-ding," said Warren, owner of Smoky's Saloon and 
Dining Hall on Santa Clara Street. "It'll feel small-townish. I think it's 
going to be very refreshing. I'm looking forward to seeing (Ventura) from the 
window of a trolley." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren has been urging the city for years to start a trolley service, ever 
since the old one failed six years ago, a victim of poor private management. 
Like other merchants in the downtown and harbor areas, Warren sees the trolley 
as a key link to the city's beaches, restaurants and other tourist 
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The trolley -- resembling a forest-green, San Francisco cable car on wheels -- 
would arrive in Ventura from Ojai. In Ojai, officials replaced the gas-fueled 
vehicle with an electric-powered car earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare, good for a full day, would be $1 for adults, 50 cents for seniors, 
and free for children under 5 years of age, residents over 75, and guests of 
the hotels whose advertisements would be plastered on the sides of the trolley. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong round-trip route would start at the Channel Islands National Park 
Visitor's Center, at the far end of the Ventura Harbor. The trolley would then 
cruise by Harbor Village, detour up to Olivas Adobe, and then travel along 
Harbor Boulevard to the pier before turning right to circle downtown and City 
Hall.  
</P>
<P>
 A conductor would describe the scenic highlights along the way, including the 
various hotels whose advertising contracts with the trolley would pay for most 
of its operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Olivas, a tourist from Burbank, said the trolley sounds like a great 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'd take it," he said, adding it would be a great diversion for his 
daughters, Christine, 12, and Abigail, 7. "When you've got kids, you like to go 
around and see some things. This way, it's done for you. It's so easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard resident Tina Sturm, 34, and her daughter, October, 11, picnicking 
Friday at the Ventura Harbor, said they too might go for a ride, if only for 
the novelty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in Southern California, you never go on one," said Tina Sturm, who 
described trolleys as "Rice-a-Roni things," likening them to the cable cars 
pictured in the packaged rice commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura had an earlier trolley, from 1986 to 1988, but low ridership and poor 
management forced the venture to shut down. This time out, promoters promise, 
it will be different. 
</P>
<P>
 With tourism up to 1.5 million visitors per year -- figures for 1998, when the 
old trolley ran, were unavailable -- city staff members and merchants are 
optimistic that the latest trolley enterprise will be a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the entire operation would be owned and managed by Madison & 
Associates, the company that operates the Ojai and Santa Barbara trolleys. But 
when the contract expires in March, the city plans to replace the privately 
owned trolley with one it will purchase with the help of a $76,996 federal 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The council would then send the trolley franchise out to bid and contract with 
the lowest bidder, who would then run the business using the city's trolley 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said a trolley would make a colorful addition to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be like Disneyland," Councilman Jim Monahan predicted. "You know, 
always got the speaker going, always telling you what things are." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an inviting kind of thing," Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures said. "It 
adds glamour."

SALES TAX MEASURE IS REJECTED FOR FALL BALLOT; TRANSPORTATION: SOME PANEL 
MEMBERS SAY THE HALF-CENT INCREASE WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO BEAR ON TOP OF THE 
RECESSION AND QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Saying voters would never tolerate it this year, the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission scrapped plans Friday to put a half-cent sales tax 
measure for roads and transit on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel voted 5 to 2 against the sales tax measure because, some members 
said, it would be too much to bear atop California's recession and January's 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the commission must wait at least until the 1996 election to try once more 
with a tax measure that won support of 60% of the people who were polled by a 
consultant the panel hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, voters rejected a half-cent transportation tax that was placed 
on the ballot and many officials fear the same thing would happen again in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago, I supported the sales tax measure heavily, and quite frankly, 
I still support the sales tax measure," said commission Chairwoman Vicky L. 
Howard at the meeting Friday in Camarillo City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we have suffered a double-whammy in this county," said Howard, who is 
also a county supervisor. "I just feel at this time to come forward with a 
sales tax flies in the face of the economic situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Several commissioners said they were worried there was not enough time before 
the Nov. 8 vote to educate enough voters about the tax to ensure victory. 
</P>
<P>
 To put the measure on the ballot, the commission would have to gain approval 
from a majority of the Board of Supervisors and at least five of the county's 
10 cities representing at least 50% of the county's population. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure called for raising Ventura County's sales tax from 7 1/4% to 7 
3/4% for 20 years. Over the life of the tax, taxpayers could have contributed 
an estimated $520 million to improving streets, roads, freeways, rail lines, 
bus routes and pollution-reduction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginger Gherardi, the commission's executive director, reported that the money 
could have paid for everything from pothole-filling on local streets to 
rebuilding the clogged Victoria Avenue and Carmen Drive interchanges along the 
Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 It also could have been used to convert county buses to run on cleaner-burning 
natural gas or electricity and for some of the running costs of the Metrolink 
rail network, Gherardi wrote in a report to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In a public hearing before the commission's vote, several people pleaded with 
commissioners to approve the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn, an alternate commission member, urged its passage. 
He told commissioners that the tax would help pay for much-needed improvements 
to the county's road and transit networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a good plan, but we don't have the money to continue with the 
plan," Flynn said. "We've got to give the voters a chance to vote on the 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental consultant Carolyn Casavan urged approval of the tax to pay for 
more public transit that could help the county meet federal mandates to reduce 
air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 4-year-olds that are not driving and are not addicted to cars yet," 
Casavan said. "We can influence the driving habits of the next generation by 
giving them a public transportation system they can use." 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Sperry, an Oak View activist, also urged its approval. "I'd much rather 
see a one-cent sales tax or five-cent sales tax on gasoline" to raise funds for 
the county's transportation system from the motorists who use it most. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Besler, the Sacramento pollster hired by the commission, said all signs in 
his poll of 400 Ventura County voters pointed to a victory for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those polled, 55% said they believe Ventura County's government is moving 
in the right direction. Besler said this shows an uncommonly high approval of 
the county government's work contrasted with poll results in other counties, 
where the approval rating is usually 10% to 15% lower, Besler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty percent of the poll respondents said they would approve of a half-cent 
sales tax and 34% indicated they would disapprove, Besler said -- an 
improvement over poll results from the commission's 1990 tax campaign, when 43% 
approved and 37% disapproved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Michael Wooten, who supported the measure along with Commissioner 
David Smith, said, "We know there's not going to be enough money. We know we 
don't have any other way to raise the money. . . . We're not even allowing the 
citizens of the county a way to vote themselves out of this crunch." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, commissioners voted it down out of political expediency. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Susan K. Lacey said just before her vote, "I am pretty much 
convinced this is not the proper time. I wish we could do this a year from 
now."

USC PUTS INMATE'S PRIZE ON HOLD; CORRECTIONS: GIRL WHO MADE AN ANTI-DRUG VIDEO 
CAN COLLECT FILM SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIP AFTER SHE SERVES TIME FOR GRAND THEFT AUTO. 
</P>

 Film school can wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at USC's School of Cinema-Television say they have decided to defer 
the scholarship prize for a Ventura County juvenile inmate's winning anti-drug 
video until after her release next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, officials had expressed uncertainty over whether Wendy Creiglow, a 
16-year-old from San Diego County serving time at the Ventura School for grand 
theft auto, would be allowed to collect the prize for her video, "Flatlines." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Youth Authority was loath to release her early, saying she had 
not completed her rehabilitation and would be ineligible for release until next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 And the USC faculty judges were not sure whether they could guarantee Wendy a 
slot next summer after granting this year's slot to the runner-up videomaker 
from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, film school officials announced they will hold Wendy's 
scholarship until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the judges of the Teens Making A Difference competition, run by USC 
and KCET-TV, could be reached Friday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the school released a statement that said, "The University of Southern 
California-School of Cinema and Television wishes to reassure Ms. Wendy 
Creiglow that her inability to participate in our program this summer in no way 
prohibits her from participating next year." 
</P>
<P>
 It concluded: "The university is committed to fostering new talent and fully 
intends to hold Ms. Creiglow's scholarship until summer 1995 when she is able 
to attend." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy, who was being videotaped Friday afternoon for a panel discussion on 
KCET's "Life and Times" program, could not be reached for comment on the 
judges' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But Youth Authority officials said they are glad she will have the chance to 
use the $4,500 scholarship in an intensive, five-week filmmaking workshop at 
the school next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Youth Authority's very proud of this young woman," said Sarah Andrade, a 
spokeswoman for California's juvenile prison system. "This is a wonderful 
accomplishment, and there's no way we would want her to miss this."

FIREWORKS SALES NO DUD IN FILLMORE; HOLIDAY: NONPROFIT GROUPS ARE PREPARING FOR 
AN ONSLAUGHT OF BUYERS FROM ALL OVER THE REGION. BUT THE MERCHANDISE IS ILLEGAL 
ANYPLACE ELSE IN VENTURA COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's an annual ritual in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 All along California 126, shacks of wood and wire mesh are going up, preparing 
for a seven-day onslaught of fireworks buyers from all over Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Rows of booths staffed with volunteers from churches, service clubs and youth 
groups will spring to life as the sale of Fourth of July fireworks becomes 
legal at noon Tuesday in one tiny corner of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tradition that Fillmore has endorsed for decades, pumping tens of 
thousands of dollars into the coffers of local organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sparklers, bottle rockets and pinwheels that will light up the sky in 
Fillmore throughout the holiday weekend are illegal anyplace else in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials are dutifully reminding residents that fireworks they buy in 
Fillmore cannot legally be ignited elsewhere. But Fillmore vendors recognize 
that many of their customers come from outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get people not only from Ventura County, but all over the region," said 
Hank Carrillo, head of the Fillmore Chamber of Commerce. "I had one lady 
contact me from the San Fernando Valley. Some of them have been coming down 
here for years." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the city's nonprofit organizations, fireworks week is the largest 
fund-raiser of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a small town like Fillmore and you have as many organizations 
as we do, it's very difficult to raise a significant amount of money," said 
Noreen Withers, city clerk in the town of 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money that the fireworks bring in is, in some cases, the entire budget 
for some of the smaller booths," she said. "That's why it's limited to 
nonprofit groups because all the money goes back into the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one organizations -- more than ever -- have received permission from 
Fillmore city officials to sell fireworks from the temporary booths. 
</P>
<P>
 "It raises about a quarter of our budget every year," said Lawrence Faulkner, 
who volunteers as president of the Fillmore Boys & Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to get support from the same small group of people for everything," 
said Faulkner, whose club sponsors after-school recreation and tutoring 
programs for 300 or more youths. "This way, everybody gets to buy some 
fireworks, have some fun, and they end up supporting the club." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire and law enforcement officials say it is a misdemeanor under state law to 
possess fireworks in an area where they are not allowed to be sold. Penalties 
can range as high as a $1,000 fine and six months in jail, said Sandi Wells of 
the Ventura County Fire Protection District. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Sheriff's Department doesn't follow people home from the Fillmore 
fireworks stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually we just respond to complaints of fireworks," said Lt. Michael Gullon. 
"If it's a little child, we talk to the parents. But when you have someone with 
a ton of them, we do cite them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gullon said the Sheriff's Department will have extra patrols at beaches and 
parks during the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people across the country fall victim to fireworks accidents 
every year, Wells said. More than 220 of those occurred in California last 
year, with nearly one-third of the injuries were to children under 10 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County alone, five injuries and 20 fires were attributed to 
fireworks last year, many of which were the result of misuse of the legal 
fireworks known as the "Safe and Sane" brand sold in Fillmore, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who organize the fireworks sales say they could not fund their 
activities without the weeklong fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're able to put more than 400 boys and young men off the streets and into a 
sports activity that bases its purposes on developing character and good 
citizenry," said Bill Faith, a board member of the Fillmore Little League. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one way we're able to do that, and keep our costs down, is by being able 
to offer the people of this community fireworks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials welcome the influx of people who show up for a city- and 
Chamber of Commerce-sponsored fireworks show. 
</P>
<P>
 At nightfall on July 4, a fireworks show will be presented at the Fillmore 
High School football field. It is the culmination of a three-day festival known 
as the Sespe Creek Chili Cookoff and Car Show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a free show where people come to enjoy the music and the fireworks," 
said Carrillo of the Fillmore chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the same day we have a chili cook-off in Central Park and a car show that 
usually draws 10,000 or more people over the weekend," Carrillo said. "And 
there will be train rides to and from Santa Paula all day Saturday, Sunday and 
on the Fourth." 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore City Councilman Roger Campbell said people have been shooting off 
fireworks in his city ever since he could remember, but there have been few 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last person that came and requested the City Council not allow fireworks 
to be sold in Fillmore was about 20 years ago," said Campbell, who also doubles 
as the assistant volunteer fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
 That person, who failed to sway the council, was George Campbell, the 
councilman's father. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had just become the new fire chief and felt it was his duty to recommend 
they be outlawed," his son explained. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Fireworks sales become legal at noon on Tuesday in Fillmore, the only Ventura 
County city that allows the sparklers and other non-explosive fireworks to be 
sold around July 4. Twenty-one organizations will be selling fireworks between 
7 a.m. and 10 p.m. daily in booths along California 126. Fireworks can be 
bought and set off between noon on Tuesday and noon on Wednesday, July 5. 
Purchasers must be 16 years old, and it is illegal to set off fireworks outside 
the city.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ROSEMEAD; MAN ARRESTED 
IN PURCHASE OF BEAR PARTS DENIES GUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A businessman arrested after he allegedly bought thousands of dollars worth of 
bear gallbladders from undercover agents denied Friday that he was involved in 
illegal animal parts trading. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a dealer," Joseph Chang said in a brief telephone interview from his 
business, AA Radiator Corp. "I don't know what happened.In court, I will say 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, 39, was arrested Thursday on a warrant charging him with three felony 
counts of purchasing bear parts. He was released that day after posting $10,000 
bail at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Temple City substation, 
jail Officer Marilyn Valdez said. 
</P>

 Chang's arrest capped an 18-month investigation that included four other 
arrests in California and several dozen in Colorado and Utah, said Lt. Eddie 
Watkins of the California Department of Fish and Game.

<P>
 Wildlife officials say the Los Angeles area has become a hub for distributing 
bear gallbladders, which fetch $265 per gram. The gallbladders come from bears 
killed in Colorado, Utah and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallbladders, officials say, are sold to Asian nations, where they are 
considered to have medicinal value in treating high blood pressure, stomach 
problems and other ailments. Asian bears are virtually extinct, Watkins said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
OKS SETTLEMENTS IN OFFICER RAPE CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has approved $685,000 in payouts to settle four 
lawsuits, including two filed by women who said a uniformed police officer 
raped them. 
</P>
<P>
 One lawsuit involved a promising teen-age tennis player who lost a chance for 
a bright professional career when a city utility truck struck her, crushing her 
legs against a parked car. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rape lawsuits, one woman will receive $195,000, the other $95,000. The 
officer involved in the separate incidents in 1991 was later convicted of rape 
under color of authority and sentenced to state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a city attorney's report, Officer Gariner Beasley raped the women 
during traffic stops, after threatening to take them to jail unless they had 
sex with him.  
</P>
<P>
 "These cases should be settled for the amounts indicated because there is 
clear legal precedent for the city being held liable for the acts of Officer 
Beasley," Deputy City Atty. Cory Brente said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council set aside $150,000 for tennis player Brahna Pastorini, who was 14 
at the time of a 1990 accident at the Van Nuys/Sherman Oaks recreation center. 
Pastorini was ranked in the top three in California and top 10 in the nation 
for her age. Two independent tennis experts said she was headed for a lucrative 
pro career.  
</P>
<P>
 She continues to play competitive tennis and won the city high school 
championship last year. But she must wear a leg brace and has lost the stamina 
she once had.  
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Los Angeles would be found liable for this accident," according 
to a city attorney's report. "A jury could award the plaintiff an amount in 
excess of the proposed settlement amount." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also appropriated $245,000 to settle a lawsuit over damage caused 
by a sanitation employee who lost control of a garbage truck that crashed into 
two cars and a house in Brentwood in 1987.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; CANDIDATE 
WHO LOST BY ONE VOTE TO ASK TO VIEW BALLOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Latino candidate whose narrow election to the Long Beach City Council was 
overturned after a recount said Friday that she will seek a court order to view 
questionable ballots that led to her one-vote loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonia Reyes Uranga was one of the first two Latinos elected to the nine-member 
council this month, but her seven-vote margin over contractor Mike Donelon 
vanished during a recount Wednesday when the city clerk's office discovered 
several uncounted ballots.In the end, Donelon beat Uranga by one vote, 2,932 to 
2,931. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga's attorney, Fredric D. Woocher, said he plans to file a request with 
the Los Angeles County Superior Court to force the city to turn over the 
ballots. Woocher said Uranga might ask the court to order a complete recount. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach City Atty. John R. Calhoun said election codes prohibit the city 
from releasing election materials to the public. "There are laws to protect the 
sanctity of these records, and we're doing what the law says shall be done," 
Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Shelba Powell was on vacation Friday and unavailable for comment. 
Deputy City Clerk Bill Joder said city staff were examining the results of the 
vote to find out what went wrong. "We're trying to determine if it was . . . 
human error," Joder said. "God, I hope it was a machine error."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI VALLEY; LOCAL MORMONS RE-ENACT TREK BY 
ANCESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sweat pouring off his brow, 16-year-old Clint Reynolds wedged his thin body 
behind the wooden handcart's thick handle Friday and pushed mightily up the 
mountain's dirt road, simulating what his Mormon ancestors had done 150 years 
before on their great trek west. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had to have been hard," said Clint, panting heavily, sun beating down on 
him, as he pushed the heavily loaded cart up a sharp incline alongside two 
other teen-agers. "Just going up this hill is hard. And they didn't have some 
of the trails that we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Clint and 152 other Mormon teen-agers from the Camarillo, Oxnard and Port 
Hueneme areas took part in the Mormon Youth Conference Pioneer Trek organized 
by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The seven-mile hike up 
Sulphur Mountain Road near Ojai, organizers said, was meant to teach young 
Mormons about the fierce struggle their ancestral pioneers undertook traveling 
west across the planes to Salt Lake Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Family and friends were purposefully split up on the hike to promote new 
friendships, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers were placed into groups of about 10, each group adopting the name and 
history of an actual 1800s Mormon family that had come west. Each of the 
"families" pushed a large handcart full of survival supplies. Participants came 
dressed in 1800s garb, trying their best to simulate the rough times of their 
ancestors, although some modern-day comforts did sneak by, such as a few small 
electric fans and some beepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard dress for the day included women in long skirts wearing 
flower-patterned bonnets -- which pioneer women had worn to protect them from 
the sun. Men donned long pants, vests, cowboy hats and anachronistic tennis 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's pull our families together here! Let's stick together," bellowed Corky 
Clevenger, 36, as young bodies started to tire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted (the teen-agers) to understand the pioneer heritage and get the 
feel of what their forefathers felt coming across the plains," Clevenger said 
as silver and turquoise decorations hanging from his vest jingled. "We hope 
they can learn that even when things are difficult, if you just hold strong, 
you can persevere." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-age hikers seemed well aware of their ancestors' westward journeys. 
In seminary classes before the trek, they learned about how the western treks 
were launched in 1847 after Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon religion, 
was killed. And about how Brigham Young then led followers away from religious 
persecution in Nauvoo, Ill., to Salt Lake Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be lucky we didn't have it as hard as they did," said Julie 
Lovstedt, 17, of Oxnard. "They had to cross frozen rivers, they had people 
dying around them. Our cart died, but we're still alive." JASON GRANT

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BOYLE HEIGHTS; PARENTS 
AT SCHOOL WIN FIGHT FOR SUMMER VACATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parents at Euclid Avenue Elementary School got their way after all -- the 
school will use a traditional summer vacation calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boyle Heights school became the focus of controversy in April for using a 
voting system in which each teacher's ballot counted for 6.32 votes and each 
parent's counted for one.The teachers, who wanted a year-round calendar, used 
their votes to overrule the parents' desire for a summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new election Thursday night in which a one-person, one-vote rule was 
used, an overwhelming majority of parents approved the traditional schedule. 
The Euclid episode had become a flash-point for many parents who say their 
voices are muted in shaping Los Angeles Unified School District policy. To help 
resolve the dispute, the district brought in professional mediators.

<P>
 A Reno couple have pleaded not guilty in the beating death of their 3-year-old 
daughter, whose body was discovered after it was thrown off a steep hillside 
into a canyon near Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea comes despite an admission by the child's stepfather to Reno police 
late last week that the child died June 15 after he had beaten her.The child's 
parents may soon be facing a capital punishment case, said Dave Stanton, Reno's 
supervising deputy district attorney and prosecutor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the district attorney may seek the death penalty for Carlos Perez 
Gutierrez and Tara Ray Gutierrez. "There are facts that establish what I call 
aggravating circumstances, which make (the case) fall within the parameters of 
a potential capital case," Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies and Reno police found the body of Mailin 
Thao Stafford below Grimes Canyon Road between Fillmore and Moorpark on 
Saturday morning. JASON GRANT

<P>
 An underground cable failure knocked out electrical power for about an hour 
and a half in portions of Port Hueneme Friday evening, shutting down stoplights 
at two major intersections during peak-hour traffic, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Power went out at about 5 p.m., causing traffic to back up at Channel Islands 
Boulevard and Victoria Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 The power failure also caused traffic delays of about two blocks at Pleasant 
Valley and Ventura roads, Port Hueneme police said. 
</P>
<P>
 No accidents were reported at either intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Southern California Edison said about 3,500 customers were 
without power. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 A 20-year-old Ventura man was shot during an attempted robbery at his house 
early Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Alvaro Ponce-Hernandez was listed in fair condition at Ventura County 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sleeping at a house he shares with three men when they were awakened 
shortly after midnight by three armed robbers at the door, said Detective Jerry 
Thurston of the Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers forced their way into the house in the 200 block of Vince Street 
after one of the men answered the door, Thurston said. The armed trio then 
grabbed the teen-aged son of one resident, Alfredo Ponce Villa Gomez, and 
threatened to shoot him unless Gomez gave them money, Thurston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez, who was later arrested for possessing cocaine for sale, threw some cash 
at the robbers, Thurston said. During the confusion, Ponce-Hernandez made a 
movement that startled one of the robbers, who shot him in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The attackers fled and Ponce-Hernandez was taken to Ventura County Medical 
Center. Investigators are still looking for the robbers. PEGGY Y. LEE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 3-year-old Ventura boy who was accidentally shot and wounded last week by 
his 6-year-old brother had recovered considerably by Friday, and was ready to 
leave the hospital, his stepfather said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Ventura County Medical Center, where 3-year-old David Cook 
had been hospitalized since the shooting incident, said the boy's condition had 
been upgraded from fair to good.They declined to comment on whether David was 
ready to leave the hospital. David's stepfather, Joe Richey, said Friday that 
the toddler is "100% better and he gets out of the hospital today." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's happier than a bug on a rug," Richey said. "He's in a great mood. All 
the nurses were coming in saying goodby to him. They're going to miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 Richey also said that he planned to reunite David with his 6-year-old brother, 
Keith, who shot him accidentally, wounding his back. Keith had found a shotgun 
in a room at Ventura's Silver Sands Motel and Apartments, where the children 
were living along with two sisters, their mother and stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that they be reunited," Richey said. "Keith is all worried 
about him. He hasn't seen him yet. . . . We are going to put them together, let 
Keith know that we all love him, we all know it was just an accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Detective Gary McCaskill said officers are still gathering 
evidence about the case. The district attorney's office will decide whether to 
prosecute David's mother and stepfather under a 1991 law which makes it illegal 
to store firearms where they are accessible to children. JASON GRANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ELIMINATE 22 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sixteen teaching positions and six non-teaching jobs will be eliminated from 
the Oxnard Union High School District next year due to an anticipated $820,142 
funding reduction, the school board has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than laying off employees, the district will cut positions primarily by 
not filling vacancies created when people quit or retired this year, Assistant 
Supt.Bob Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the district will not renew the contracts of about five temporary 
teachers. The district will also cut five maintenance worker jobs and one 
groundskeeper position. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the teaching staff cutback, the district's average class size will not 
change, Brown said. The district had too many teachers in 1993-94, he said, 
because it overestimated student enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really somewhat overstaffed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district projects that its budget will drop from $53.7 million this year 
to $52.9 million next year in part because state funding will decrease to 
reflect the smaller number of students expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the district projected an enrollment of 12,269 students at its five 
high schools and one continuation school. But the year ended with only 11,565 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials believe, Brown said, that families are moving out of the 
Oxnard area to find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the expected $180,000 drop in state funding, the district is 
projecting federal funding to decline by $358,610 to $2.7 million, primarily 
from the migrant education budget. MAIA DAVIS

<P>
 Troubled students in the Conejo Valley will soon be able to make up failed or 
missed credits through an intensive new program on the Newbury Park High School 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Unified School District board members this week unanimously 
approved a school-within-a-school program designed to help struggling 
teen-agers re-enter traditional classrooms and graduate with their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 The program still needs review by the state Board of Education, but district 
officials hope to gain swift approval and launch the mini-high school this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be up and running," Assistant Supt. Richard Simpson said. "Maybe not 
the first day, but by the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 The new program will essentially create a second continuation school in the 
Conejo Valley district, serving 25 students at a time with counseling and a low 
student-teacher ratio. The existing continuation school, known as Conejo Valley 
High School, serves about 250 students. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO STATE TAX 
EVASION

<P>
 A 33-year-old inventor pleaded guilty in Ventura County Municipal Court Friday 
to charges of state income tax evasion after trying to trick authorities into 
thinking he was living in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake R. Schwartzman, the co-inventor of the raised plastic ring that protects 
Swatch watches from scratching against rough surfaces, failed to file state tax 
returns on more than $1 million from 1987 to 1989.He now faces back taxes, 
penalties and interest of more than $200,000 and could serve up to three years 
in prison, said Jim Reber of the California Franchise Tax Board. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Schwartzman, a Westlake Village resident, created a company in 
Williamson County, Tex., called Best Timing. He also registered to vote, opened 
several bank accounts and obtained a driver's license in Texas, which has no 
state income tax, Reber said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can only suspect that he wanted to save $200,000 in taxes," Reber said.  
</P>
<P>
 California authorities learned from a confidential informant earlier this year 
that Schwartzman never actually moved to Texas and had been living in 
California all along. After checking Schwartzman's financial and utility 
records and other documents, authorities charged him with tax evasion in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unusual case because of the lengths he went through to deceive 
us," Reber said. "We believed there was criminal intent." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartzman's sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 5. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

 A sophisticated band of thieves has been cleaning out bank accounts in Simi

 The bandits park a van or camper within sight of an automated teller machine 
and videotape ATM customers' fingers as they punch in their personal 
identification numbers, according to a report by Simi Valley Police Detective 
Steven DeLamater. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they read the account number off the customer's discarded receipt and 
make a bogus ATM card using a laptop computer and card programmer in the 
vehicle, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, DeLamater reports, they read the customer's code number off the 
videotape and use it and the fake card to steal money from the account. The 
thefts usually are not discovered until the customer's monthly statement 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each transaction is worth $200 to $300, depending on the particular bank -- 
they each have a limit on how much you can pull out at a time," Simi Valley 
Police Sgt. Bob Gardner said. Detectives have no solid leads yet, but are 
working with banks to get a look at security camera pictures of people using 
the ATMs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley detectives are working on the cases with the Secret Service, a 
branch of the U. S. Treasury Department that enforces some banking laws. MACK

WOMAN SAVES CHILD AS SHE IS KILLED BY RUNAWAY BUS AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A field trip to the Los Angeles Zoo was marred by tragedy Friday when an 
idling school bus, whose driver was outside, rolled over and killed a 
50-year-old woman just after she had pushed a little boy out of harm's way, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor, whose name was not released because her family has not been 
notified, and the 3-year-old were dragged under the vehicle as it started to 
roll. 
</P>
<P>
 She maneuvered the child to safety just before one of the bus's wheels rolled 
over her, California Highway Patrol officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chartered bus was on an incline at Griffith Park about 1:30 p.m. when the 
accident occurred. Some of the 29 children, ages 3 to 4 years old, and nine 
adult supervisors were aboard and others were waiting to board for a return 
trip to Jardin de Ninos preschool in Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 While the supervisor was helping the boy into the bus, the 35,000-pound 
vehicle began to roll down the incline. Authorities were not immediately 
certain if its emergency brake had failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said children screamed and scattered as the supervisor and boy 
somehow were pulled under the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "She grabbed the child and cradled him" before she pushed him under the center 
of the bus, away from the wheels, CHP Sgt. Jill Angel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy sustained minor cuts to his knees and elbows and was under observation 
at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles on Friday night, CHP Officer Paul Martinez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bus was rolling, the driver ran parallel to it and jumped in. He 
stopped the vehicle before it reached the bottom of the hill, Angel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle was towed to a CHP garage where it was being inspected. Martinez 
said its last CHP inspection was two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just heard everyone go, 'Ay! ay!' Then everyone cried," said Jesus Rubio, 
who was sitting on a nearby hill with his wife when the bus started rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was a tragedy that the woman was killed, Martinez said people were 
relieved that the children were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main concern was the children," he said, gesturing over to the field 
where the preschoolers were playing as the woman's body was put inside an 
emergency vehicle. "They're doing OK now." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a crisis intervention team visited the children at the school after 
they had returned in another vehicle, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Martin, a supervisor with Mark IV, the company from which the bus was 
chartered, would not comment on the accident.

3 CHINESE INDICTED IN CONSPIRACY TO KIDNAP COMPATRIOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Chinese nationals were indicted Friday for conspiracy in a plot to 
kidnap a Chinese tourist who was visiting the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl F. Zhang, 31, John F. Zhang, 24, and Mary Wang, 30, conspired to abduct 
Zhou Xing Ping, a Chinese businessman touring the United States, and force him 
to leave California, according to the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 13, 1993, the Zhang brothers forced Zhou from his Rosemead hotel, 
handcuffed and hit him on the head as they threw him to the floor of a car. For 
the next two days, the two Zhangs and another unidentified man held Zhou at two 
hotels. For 48 hours, Zhou was bound, masked, gagged and forced to sit in 
bathrooms, according to the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnapers repeatedly beat and interrogated Zhou about money borrowed from 
two government-owned banks in the People's Republic of China that he had not 
repaid because of business losses, the U.S. attorney said. The captors took 
Zhou's belongings, including his credit cards, and stole money with his bank 
credit card, Assistant U.S. Atty. Saul D. Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plot to abduct Zhou failed when the Zhang brothers brought him to Los 
Angeles International Airport on Oct. 15. Zhou escaped by screaming for help at 
the security checkpoint. The Zhangs fled and were later arrested in the Chicago 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Wang, a former business associate of Zhou, allegedly assisted in the 
conspiracy by giving the Zhang brothers information about Zhou's location in 
California. Wang also attempted to lure Zhou to several locations where the 
Zhang brothers waited, Brenner said. Wang has not yet been arrested.

EX-DEPUTY POLICE CHIEF ENTERS PLEA; COURTS: DANIEL R. SULLIVAN DENIES ILLEGALLY 
POSSESSING CONFIDENTIAL LAPD RECORDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Retired Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Daniel R. Sullivan pleaded not guilty 
Friday in Los Angeles Municipal Court to charges that he illegally possessed 
confidential law enforcement information in the files of his private 
investigation company, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan and Thomas Whiteaker, of Whiteaker Investigative Services in Mission 
Hills, are accused of receiving confidential information from Walter Ray 
Bentley Jr., a police officer who resigned from the force after being arrested 
on child pornography charges last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan is the highest-ranking former LAPD official to face criminal 
corruption charges since scandals in the early 1900s led to an overhaul of the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 He has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors, increasingly concerned about officers selling or 
bartering confidential information to private detectives, launched a campaign 
to prevent the illegal use of police computers to gain access to confidential 
information, such as criminal records and driver's license files. 
</P>
<P>
 A subsequent investigation led to the arrest of Sullivan, Whiteaker and 
Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Bentley obtained information from LAPD computers on 
various people, including witnesses in criminal cases, and passed it on to 
Sullivan and Whiteaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson, who is prosecuting the three, alleged that 
Whiteaker was given information about a witness in a murder case who had been 
relocated for his protection, and information on actor Todd Bridges, who has 
had several run-ins with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan and Whiteaker face 10 counts of receiving criminal records that are 
confidential materials and one count of conspiracy to receive criminal history 
materials. A preliminary hearing for Sullivan was set for July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley, who faces 11 counts of illegal computer access and fraud, is 
scheduled to be arraigned Thursday and Whiteaker on July 13.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; ARTISTS PITCH IN TO ASSIST QUAKE 
VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As she struggles to patch together enough loans and grants to rebuild her 
quake-damaged home, Thousand Oaks artist Michele Weston Relkin has a new source 
to draw from: the generosity of her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Donated works by local painters, sculptors and jewelry makers sold well at a 
recent silent auction fund-raiser for Relkin, bringing in nearly $2,000.More 
money will come in throughout the month as Relkin's gallery will donate 20% of 
the sales price of any item to her building fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good turnout for the auction -- it was just a real positive thing," 
organizer Phyllis Doyon said. "We'll say it's a success because any money for 
Michele's building fund is a big help to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Turned down for a loan from the Small Business Administration, Relkin is still 
waiting for word from the Individual Family Grant Program and the Thousand Oaks 
City Council, which will dole out federal funds to earthquake victims next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 While she waits, Relkin said the $2,000 will help her hire engineers to begin 
evaluating her house's condition. "It was really heartwarming to see everyone 
there, I'll tell you that," she said. "I think this will be a turning point." 
</P>
<P>
 Relkin's Gallery 9, situated in the Hamburger Hamlet Plaza on Agoura Road, is 
open from 1 to 9 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays, from noon to 9 p.m. Saturdays and 
from noon to 5 p.m. Sundays. STEPHANIE SIMON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Air pollution levels in several east Ventura County cities reached the 
unhealthful level Friday, and poor air quality was predicted again today for 
Simi Valley, county officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
 As temperatures soared to a high of 93 degrees in Simi Valley, the pollution 
standard index in Simi Valley hit 153, the Ventura County Air Pollution 
District reported.Air quality was also poor in Fillmore, Piru, Ojai and 
Thousand Oaks as the pollution standard index soared into the unhealthful 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state and federal guidelines, air quality is declared unhealthful if the 
pollution standard index exceeds 100, and a health advisory is issued if the 
level goes above 138, according to federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures today are expected to stay in the upper 80s to low 90s across the 
county. In Simi Valley, air quality is predicted to reach unhealthful stages at 
about 125, while pollution levels will be slightly lower elsewhere in the 
county. TRACY WILSON

AN ARMENIAN SOLDIER'S PERSPECTIVE: 'DYING MANY TIMES IS NOT ENOUGH'; WAR: 
FIGHTER WOUNDED IN BATTLES WITH AZERBAIJAN IS BROUGHT TO GLENDALE FOR 
TREATMENT. NEARLY KILLED TWICE, HE STILL WANTS TO RETURN TO THE FRONT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is nothing much new in a soldier, wounded in one of the world's endless 
conflicts, coming to the United States for treatment as the guest of a group of 
concerned Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Artour Ovtchian, a 21-year-old native Armenian, the goodwill gesture 
he is experiencing is the most important. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the efforts of the largest group of Armenians outside of Asia, 
those in Glendale, Ovtchian may again be able to walk more than a few steps, to 
write, to tie his shoes and, he hopes, to again fight in the war that has twice 
almost taken his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict, only the latest in a century of wars fought by the Armenians in 
the name of autonomy, has claimed 15,000 lives since the mostly Armenian 
population of Nagorno-Karabakh, asserted its independence from Azerbaijan six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the United States has not been fighting a war on its soil, it's very 
difficult for an American to understand my way of thinking," Ovtchian said, 
sitting in a chair in his hospital room and speaking through an interpreter. 
"Our national pride has been put to the test and for that reason, dying many 
times is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Ovtchian should know. In April, an Azerbaijani rifle shot just beneath his 
hairline left him partially paralyzed on his left side. Now, his left arm hangs 
limply and painfully at his side, although he has regained some movement below 
the elbow. He is able to walk short distances by dragging his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, he was almost left for dead when he was shot through the left 
part of his jaw, the bone blown clear out of his head. At the same time, 
shrapnel embedded in his chest punctured his lungs. Scars along his boyish face 
from those bone grafts and the sun-shaped tracheotomy mark at his throat serve 
as reminders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a very handsome, clean-cut boy before the war," he said simply. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovtchian's chances of returning to the front lines are not good, doctors said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A soldier since he was 16, Ovtchian said he plans to continue the war effort 
in a supporting role if he cannot return to the battlefield. But one day, he 
said, he would like to be a lawyer and help protect the rule of law in his new 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't enjoy the war condition, and we have a lot of other problems as 
well," Ovtchian said. "I don't wish that your or any other city would suffer 
the way we have. And we are still suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 Chosen by a group in his native country, he was brought to Glendale Adventist 
Medical Center by the Armenian National Committee, with an office in Glendale, 
and the Armenian Cultural Foundation, based in Glendale. Those groups paid for 
his trip to Southern California. The hospital is absorbing the estimated 
$40,000 bill for Ovtchian's estimated four- to five-week stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups helping Ovtchian said their efforts allow Americans of Armenian 
ancestry a chance to reach back, to connect with the old country and the 
maltreated compatriots their parents left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard not to recognize suffering, and when you recognize the suffering is 
the exact same as affected your family, you can empathize," said Dr. Steven 
Kamajian, Ovtchian's primary physician. 
</P>
<P>
 "You become very clannish when all four of your grandparents were orphans. You 
approach anyone similar to you as family, and I approach this boy as part of my 
family."

DONORS URGE PRIVATE PANEL FOR PLAZA; THOUSAND OAKS: PATRONS CONCERNED ABOUT 
POLITICAL PRESSURE AND PUBLIC SCRUTINY CALL FOR A NONPROFIT BOARD TO OVERSEE 
MANAGEMENT OF THE CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to shield financial decisions about the Civic Arts Plaza from political 
pressure and public scrutiny, a group of major donors and fund-raisers wants a 
private board to oversee management of the $64-million center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza is now run by a seven-member committee of business and 
civic leaders appointed by the Thousand Oaks City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard Johnson, director of the nonprofit Alliance for the Arts 
fund-raising campaign, has proposed dissolving the council-appointed committee 
and replacing it with a 15-member, nonprofit board of governors. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional seats would go to the Alliance for the Arts, major donors and 
representatives from the Arts Commission and Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said his proposal was spurred by concerns from the alliance's Founders 
Circle, a group of about 30 individual and corporate donors who have given at 
least $50,000 each toward the arts center. Some of these big-ticket 
contributors, he said, are worried that their contributions may be mishandled 
or "subject to political maneuvering" because council appointees control purse 
strings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to be sure the money is used appropriately," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bert Greynald, a member of the Founders Circle, said he favors creating a 
larger, private board instead of several separate groups all wanting to have a 
voice in the center's operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Placing donors on the board, he said, would also help attract other major 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would feel it would be further removed from the political process," he 
said. "After all, we're trying to do an art thing here, not a political thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Virginia Davis, chairwoman of the theater commission, said she does not 
believe that control over finances is a legitimate concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe everyone on this commission is looking to do the best for this 
facility," she said. "We work well together. We make decisions. There's been no 
political overtones whatsoever with this commission." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the project's endowment coffers stand at $4.5 million, and the 
alliance has set a goal of raising $10 million by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the theater commission has not made any decision about endowment 
spending, but the panel will probably start dealing with the issue after the 
Civic Arts Plaza opens in the fall. The endowment is designed to subsidize the 
day-to-day operations of the cultural center so the city will not be forced to 
dip into the taxpayer-supported general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater commissioners will discuss Johnson's restructuring proposal at 
their meeting Wednesday night. And although the commission can offer an opinion 
on Johnson's suggestion, the City Council must approve any changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo said he believes it is too early to start tinkering 
with the makeup of the commission, which was convened for the first time last 
fall and has been meeting monthly to plan programming, advertising and 
operation of the cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schillo said he would support making the group more autonomous by changing 
commissioners' terms. As it stands now, each commissioner's term expires when 
the council member who appointed him or her faces reelection. With three 
council seats up for grabs in November, the commission's makeup could change 
considerably just a month after the Civic Arts Plaza's grand opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater commissioners "have only been operating less than a year and we 
haven't even opened the theater yet," Schillo said. "That's why I think we need 
to give it a little more time before we make any major changes." 
</P>
<P>
 In proposing a board of governors, Johnson raised concerns about financial 
oversight and also about public scrutiny.  
</P>
<P>
 As a formal city panel appointed by the council, the theater commission must 
post agendas, hold open meetings and invite public testimony. The proposed 
board of governors, a private nonprofit advisory group, would be exempt from 
such requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about the theater commission's open meeting requirement erupted 
earlier this year when the panel debated hiring singer and actress Bernadette 
Peters to perform during the grand opening weekend. The contract, including the 
star's salary and perks, was much publicized to the dismay of Peters' agents 
and the city's negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opening contracts and negotiations to the public is embarrassing and it can 
create problems," Johnson said. "What they have now is not quite right and 
needs to be worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Most other theaters in California and throughout the country are run by 
private panels, nonprofit boards or artistic directors, and do not have to 
publicize contracts, according to Tom Mitze, director of the Civic Arts Plaza's 
1,800-seat auditorium and 400-seat community theater. 
</P>
<P>
 To bring Thousand Oaks' venue in line with other theaters, Councilwoman Elois 
Zeanah said she would support the effort to keep contract details private. But 
she disliked the idea of turning over control of the endowment to a group that 
could deliberate and decide behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I could support keeping costs hidden from the council, the 
public, or the press," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah also criticized Johnson's proposal for giving too much power to the 
Alliance for the Arts, a non-appointed, non-elected group of citizen activists, 
attorneys and fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel the alliance should have the ability to appoint and decide which 
corporate donors should sit" on a reconstituted theater commission, Zeanah 
said. "I'm going to have to look at this very carefully."

ANNIVERSARY OF FOUNDER'S DEATH TO BE REMEMBERED; MORMONS: CARTHAGE, ILL., THE 
SITE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S SLAYING 150 YEARS AGO, WILL BE THE FOCUS OF THE 
CEREMONIES FEATURING CHURCH LEADERS.

<P>
 On a muggy June afternoon in 1844, four Mormon men waited pensively in the 
upper room of a primitive Illinois jail. The prisoners talked of home, sang 
melancholy hymns and offered prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, gunfire shattered the quiet. Men with blackened faces stormed up the 
stairs, shooting through the door. In an instant, one man lay dead, another 
shot in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Smith, the 38-year-old founder of the Mormon Church, raced to the 
window, where he was shot. He wailed "Oh Lord, my God," fell out the window, 
and died. 
</P>
<P>
 That scenario in the town of Carthage is known to Mormon faithful as "the 
Martyrdom," the climax of a 14-year cycle of attacks and flight on the nascent 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And it permanently embedded a 
sense of persecution into the Mormon psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend Mormons will commemorate the 150th anniversary of their founder's 
death. President Howard W. Hunter, current leader of the church, will be in 
Carthage for the anniversary activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1820, Joseph Smith was a farm boy in a region of Upstate New York known as 
the "burned-over district" because of the waves of religious revivals sweeping 
through the area. 
</P>
<P>
 At 14, Smith claimed that he had a vision of God and Jesus Christ, who told 
Smith all the churches had lost the true Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, Smith reported that an angel named Moroni directed him to 
find plates of gold, on which was written the history of a Hebrew family that 
migrated to the Americas and whose descendants were said to have been visited 
by the resurrected Jesus. Using spiritual tools, Smith reportedly translated 
the ancient writings into the Book of Mormon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Smith began telling his story and selling the Book of Mormon, 
opposition arose among skeptics and offended Christians. He was derided as an 
impostor and a "money digger," but his book of scripture hit a responsive note 
among many New York believers who sought a return to primitive Christianity 
stripped of dogma and cumbersome rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 14 years, Smith's following numbered in the thousands. They were chased 
from state to state, persecuted for their theological innovations, political 
unity, communal economics, and finally their social arrangements, which 
included a return to patriarchal polygamy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of it all was the charismatic Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Bloom, a preeminent American literary critic, says: "Mormon history is 
Joseph Smith, and his continued effect upon his saints." 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing Smith to Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman, Bloom calls him "an 
authentic religious genius" who "surpassed all Americans, before or since, in 
the possession and expression of what could be called the religion-making 
imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 "What Whitman sang, Joseph Smith actually embodied," Bloom said. "The ordeal 
of prophecy, perpetually embattled both inside and outside his movement, 
transmogrified the ardent idealist who composed the Book of Mormon. Smith 
matters permanently, to America and the world, because of the fierce alchemy he 
underwent from 1832 to 1844." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1844, however, the antagonisms from Illinois neighbors and former Mormons 
boiled over into the murders of Smith and his older brother, Hyrum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mormon movement was threatened with extinction. But the martyrdom renewed 
Mormon resolve, purged the group of all but the most determined, and propelled 
followers on a western exodus and expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the Mormon Church has nearly 9 million members worldwide. But the 
founding events, and particularly the assassination of Smith, have left its 
mark on the inheritors of the faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormon hymns still sing of Joseph Smith, "who communed with Jehovah," and who 
is even now in heaven pleading for his brethren. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Smith is a "tragic tale that ends in spiritual triumph," said 
Levi Peterson, a Mormon novelist and professor at Weber State University in 
Ogden, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 After trekking about 1,200 miles to the Great Basin, the Mormons established 
themselves in the mountains of the Southwest. A movie entitled "Legacy" 
recounts the story of the church's early persecution and now plays to packed 
movie houses in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "The martyrdom is still in the living mythology of the Mormons," Peterson 
said. "Mormonism wouldn't be what it is today if the martyrdom hadn't sealed 
the conviction that Joseph Smith was telling the truth."

EPISCOPALIANS SEEK TO AVOID DIVISIONS ON HOMOSEXUALITY; RELATIONSHIPS: BISHOPS, 
NOTING PROBLEMS OF OTHER DENOMINATIONS, ASK CHURCH TO UPHOLD AN IDEAL OF 
LIFELONG FAITHFUL UNIONS FOR HETEROSEXUAL AND GAY COUPLES.

<P>
 In 1991, a Presbyterian committee created an uproar when it said sex outside 
of marriage between genuinely consenting adults was OK. Its report was 
overwhelmingly rejected at the church's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, when an Evangelical Lutheran Church in America committee on 
sexuality released a draft statement urging members to challenge traditional 
biblical condemnations of homosexuality, the church reacted to the subsequent 
backlash by appointing a new writing panel and assuring members that any 
official policy would stand on biblical foundations and the confessional 
tradition of the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Now U.S. Episcopal bishops are trying what they hope will be a less 
contentious approach to sexuality with a draft statement that asks the church 
to uphold an ideal of lifelong faithful unions for both heterosexual and 
homosexual couples, and greet gays and lesbians with hospitality rather than 
hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it can be for heterosexual persons, the experience of steadfast love can 
be for homosexual persons an experience of God," the bishops say in the fourth 
draft of their proposed pastoral teaching on human sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the document also relates traditional church teaching that 
sex is reserved for heterosexual marriages and stops short of advocating 
changes in church law on the issues of gay ordinations or the blessing of 
same-sex unions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The document doesn't take a stand one way or the other, basically," said the 
Rev. Jane N. Garrett, a member of the drafting committee. "It leaves everything 
open for a continuation of the dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bishop William Frey, dean of Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry, said 
presenting different points of view is not pastoral teaching, but a reflection 
of the chaos in the church on these issues today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nicest thing I can say is that parts of it remind me of theology by Oprah 
and Donahue," he said. "In its present form, it would be the most embarrassing 
document the bishops have ever produced." 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to avoid the Lutherans' fate, the bishops had decided to bypass 
the pews in the drafting process by keeping the document confidential until the 
denomination's General Convention beginning Aug. 24 in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fourth draft of the report was released recently by Episcopalians 
United, a conservative group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several bishops and laity from the theological left and right have questioned 
this clandestine process," said the Rev. Todd Wetzel, the group's executive 
director. "It seems the only people pleased with this secrecy are those who 
have the most to gain from it." 
</P>
<P>
 A drafting committee is now polishing up a fifth draft that is expected to be 
circulated to all the bishops in a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members would not comment on the contents of the final draft, but 
said it would not shake up the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be a particularly radical document," said Bishop Frank 
Allan of Atlanta. "If people want to get titillated by it, they can get 
titillated by something else." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Episcopal Church, the denomination's legislative body has declared both 
that homosexuals are children of God who have a full and equal claim with all 
other persons upon the church and that physical sexual expression is 
appropriate only within the lifelong, monogamous union of husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The church has said it is not appropriate to ordain practicing gays or 
lesbians, but several bishops have gone ahead and publicly or quietly ordained 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 1991 General Convention in Phoenix, the House of Bishops was ordered to 
prepare a pastoral teaching on sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth draft of "Continuing the Dialogue: A Pastoral Teaching of the House 
of Bishops to the Church as It Considers Issues of Human Sexuality" takes note 
of the traditional church teaching that sex is appropriate only within marriage 
and of the experience of gays and lesbians identifying their love with Jesus 
Christ in long-term, committed relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 In a section on Scripture, two interpretations are offered. One interpretation 
said the biblical texts condemning homosexuality should be taken at their word. 
"Sexual activity of any kind comes to be seen as sinful, and homosexual 
practice as especially dishonorable." 
</P>
<P>
 The other interpretation said that the texts can also be viewed in the larger 
context of the spirit of the law upholding love for all and that texts written 
in a period with a different understanding of homosexuality should not be used 
"to demean and perhaps exclude a whole group of disciples." 
</P>
<P>
 In a section offering pastoral guidelines, the fourth draft declares that 
sexual relationships reach their full potential in the context of chaste, 
faithful and committed lifelong union between mature adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this is as true for homosexual as for heterosexual relationships 
and that such relationships need and should receive the pastoral care of the 
church," the statement says. 
</P>
<P>
 In a vague reference to ordination, the bishops recommend the church ordain 
only persons believed to be "wholesome examples." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Church of Christ is the only major Protestant group to allow the 
ordination of active homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett said that given the tensions in the church the drafting committee 
deliberately avoided taking a stand on issues such as the ordination of 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way at this moment to reconcile those differences," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wetzel disagrees. He said the document is a sophisticated attempt to place 
homosexual relations on a par with heterosexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the real intent of the document is pretty clear: to legitimate 
homosexual practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a leader of an Episcopal gay rights group said that is already happening 
-- with or without a statement from the bishops. 
</P>
<P>
 E. Kim Byham, publisher of the Voice of Integrity, said blessings of same-sex 
unions have occurred in churches throughout the country, and homosexuals have 
been ordained in 35 dioceses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a done deal," he said.

BEILENSON, GALLEGLY SEE NO ROLE FOR STATES IN SETTING TERM LIMITS; POLITICS: 
DEMOCRAT OPPOSES THEM, REPUBLICAN SAYS IT SHOULD BE A FEDERAL MATTER. HIGH 
COURT PREPARES TO RULE.

 Ventura County's two representatives are divided over the issue of 
congressional term limits but agree that California voters made a mistake by 
passing a 1992 measure to restrict the state's representatives to six 
consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of this week's announcement that the U.S. Supreme Court will 
decide whether states can impose term limits on members of Congress, Reps. 
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) 
expressed opposition to such action. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly would like to see a national 12-year cap on House members and has 
co-sponsored a bill to achieve this aim; Beilenson strongly opposes the concept 
of restricting tenure at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really ought to have a right to choose whom they want," said 
Beilenson, who is seeking a 10th two-year term in a district that includes most 
of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have limits. Many of us are involved in close and difficult and 
expensive reelection campaigns now, as we have been all our lives. People have 
an opportunity every two years to pass judgment on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, on the other hand, said that, despite this argument, he backs 
across-the-board restrictions because "the overwhelming majority of the people 
in this country do support reasonable limitations. I think 12 years is 
reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court will hear an appeal of a decision by the Arkansas Supreme 
Court. That court ruled in March that a term-limits amendment approved by the 
state's voters in a 1992 referendum violated the federal Constitution, which 
stipulates the qualifications for federal lawmakers. The case will be argued 
this fall and is expected to be decided next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 California voters, like those in Arkansas, approved an initiative that 
restricts House members to three terms and U.S. senators to two six-year terms. 
If the measure is upheld by the court, House members elected in 1992 could not 
remain in office beyond 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve states besides California and Arkansas have placed restrictions on the 
number of terms that members of their congressional delegations can serve. The 
Arkansas appeal is the first to reach the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson predicted that the court will rule that states do not have the 
authority to limit congressional terms. The Constitution requires only that a 
member of Congress be 25 years of age, a citizen of the United States for seven 
years and an inhabitant of the state from which he is elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he has become a better representative over time. He cited, in 
particular, the knowledge he accumulated during his stint on the House Select 
Committee on Intelligence, which he ultimately chaired. He contends that term 
limits would rob Congress of much wisdom and institutional memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just foolish on the face of it to force out people who are experienced 
and wise and have, over the years, accumulated a lot of important knowledge 
about the specific subjects over which they have jurisdiction," said Beilenson, 
who was a state legislator before being elected to Congress in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although some people obviously outlive their usefulness, it's not true of the 
majority of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who is seeking his fifth term, said he opposed California's 
Proposition 164 because it would greatly reduce the state's clout in Congress 
and because the six-year time frame is too short. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to have term limits, the only way that it will work fairly 
between the states on the federal level is for it to be universal for all 
members of the House," Gallegly said, noting that House leadership positions 
are largely based on seniority. "To impose limitations on one state and not 
another really is cutting off your nose to spite your face." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would prefer a 12-year limitation because of the time it takes 
simply to "get yourself up to speed on the dynamics of the job and represent 
the people at home. . . . Six years is too short a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who maintains that campaign finance reform should be a higher 
priority than term limits, declined to commit himself to a 12-year limit unless 
such a law is passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never say never," the former Simi Valley mayor said. "But I don't foresee 
myself serving in the House more than 12 years."

DESERT GATHERING TO EXPLORE AMERICAN MUSLIM EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking a cue from Native American tribes, hundreds of American-born Muslims 
are gathering in the high desert of New Mexico for a powwow this weekend to 
explore the unique challenges of being Muslim in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides horseback riding, practicing tai chi and singing devotional songs 
around the campfire, the 400 participants in the second annual North American 
Muslim Powwow will tackle some serious subjects, many of them dealing with the 
pressures Muslims feel in a culture that often perceives them as religious 
fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering at Dar-al-Islam, a Muslim retreat center and mosque in the town 
of Abiquiu, will include sessions devoted to religious intolerance and 
reconciling the values of the MTV generation with the Muslim precept of 
submission to Allah. The gathering also will pose difficult questions about 
what it means to be a Muslim man or woman in a society whose gender roles are 
constantly in flux. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the estimated 4 million to 6 million Muslims in America, most have 
emigrated here from South Asia or the Middle East. But according to conference 
organizer Hakim Archuletta, the American Muslim community is at a demographic 
turning point. 
</P>
<P>
 "The increasing numbers of African American converts to Islam and the numbers 
of immigrants whose children were born here are bringing us into a new era," 
said Archuletta. "American-born Muslims are beginning to outnumber the 
immigrants."

 When a man dying of cancer asked his social worker to send a clergyman to his 
home to plan a funeral, at first he and his wife had trouble understanding the 
role of Chaplain Leonard J. Lewy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is your congregation?" the couple asked. "It is right here in this 
room," he responded. "And in the rooms of other homes that I have the privilege 
to go to in my work." 
</P>
<P>
 That visit was the first of many over a two-month period when Lewy got to know 
family members and offer them emotional and spiritual support. When he 
eventually officiated at the funeral, he said, "it was a more meaningful and 
personal service because I knew the family and connected with them." 
</P>
<P>
 As a professionally trained, full-time chaplain for the nonprofit Visiting 
Nurse Assn. of Los Angeles, Lewy enjoys a relatively unique position. "My 
organization has truly gone all out for chaplaincy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewy, an ordained Conservative rabbi, received certification in clinical 
pastoral education at UCLA Medical Center's department of pastoral care. The 
Rev. David Myler, associate department director, said: "The VNA is in the 
forefront in its commitment to a full-time, professionally trained chaplain as 
part of hospice care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many hospices rely on untrained volunteers. That's not being fair to 
their clients and not taking seriously the spiritual needs of people who are 
under their care," he said. "Book learning, even in a seminary, doesn't teach 
you how to deal with people." 
</P>
<P>
 The association's Yvette Luque Hospice program has contracts with such 
hospitals as Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, Huntington Memorial in Pasadena and 
Valley Presbyterian in Van Nuys to provide home care for patients diagnosed as 
terminally ill. It also receives referrals from individuals. Last year, it 
counseled about 1,500 patients and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Kris Hillary, a veteran registered nurse who directs the seven regional 
offices of the nursing group's hospice, sees Lewy's role as integral to 
holistic care of the dying and their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hospice is a philosophy of care that stresses comfort and manages symptoms -- 
not only physical ones," she said. "We take care of everything that happens to 
people when they die, not only the patients, but their families' psychosocial 
and spiritual needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because someone's spirituality is so much a part of what they are, it is 
extremely important to provide spiritual support during the dying process," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewy visits up to 20 patients a week in their homes or nursing facilities. He 
oversees two part-time chaplains who are ordained ministers and are certified 
in clinical pastoral education. 
</P>
<P>
 He is receiving advanced training at UCLA and plans to launch a program to 
help clergy learn how to minister to people on an interfaith model in a hospice 
setting. He will begin training seminarians in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "We visit everyone from new age people to atheists," he said. "It's not so 
much religious care we provide, but spiritual care. Being there. Listening to 
people. Putting yourself in the breach. My Christian colleagues call it 'the 
ministry of presence.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lewy says his work is not finished when a patient dies; he continues to 
provide spiritual care for the bereaved as long as he is needed. The hospice 
also runs grief recovery groups and holds nondenominational memorial gatherings 
that he describes as "a combination of a bereavement group and a memorial 
service." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his formal training, "what I do is not a science," he said. "It's 
holding out a hand, being open to conversation or prayer, but never forcing 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Death is a part of life," he said. "It sounds like a cliche, but we all have 
to face it and it seems more natural in this setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very privileged to do this special kind of work," Lewy said. "I really 
feel this is the fulfillment of what I set out to do when I became a rabbi." 
</P>
<P>
 The 55-year-old Visiting Nurse Assn. of Los Angeles is a community-based 
health agency that makes 350,000 visits a year to patients in their homes and 
nursing facilities, providing skilled nursing, rehabilitation, social, home 
care and other services on an ability-to-pay basis. For information about the

 Lutheran Bishop J. Roger Anderson of Los Angeles, who has overseen more than 
150 churches in a five-county synod since 1988, has announced his resignation 
to become pastor of a church in an Arizona retirement community. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, 58, who lives in Thousand Oaks, was the first Los Angeles-based 
bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, the nation's largest 
Lutheran body formed from the merger of three denominations in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson would have been up for reelection next June, but he recently 
announced that he wanted to return to parish ministry in Sun City West, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 "The call from the congregation came as a complete surprise," said Anderson, 
whose resignation is effective Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, in the back of my mind, I've wanted to return to parish work for the 
last five or six years of my ministry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Church Council of the Southern California (West) Synod will meet this 
weekend to appoint an interim bishop and decide whether to elect a new bishop 
at a special assembly in the fall or wait until the regular meeting next year, 
said Barbara Price, an assistant to the bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 The synod embraces 155 congregations and nearly 60,000 members in Los Angeles, 
Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. 
</P>
<P>
 With Roman Catholic Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and Episcopal Bishop Frederick 
Borsch, Anderson in November signed a covenant of mutual support involving the 
three church bodies in the Southern California area.

SIMI VALLEY MAY GET NEW STUDY OF SOIL STABILITY; SAFETY: COUNCIL, SPURRED BY 
ANGRY RESIDENTS, WILL CONSIDER FUNDING SECOND SURVEY IN AREA HIT HARD BY QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Responding to irate residents hard hit by the Jan. 17 earthquake, the Simi 
Valley City Council on Monday will consider spending $50,000 to determine if 
the ground in a neighborhood in the city's southeast area is still shifting. 
</P>
<P>
 A soil survey of the neighborhood by the California Department of Conservation 
concluded in May that the ground in the area was stable. The study, which cost 
$72,000, examined soil stability in an area south of Los Angeles Avenue near 
Yosemite Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey's conclusions angered local residents, who said they have continued 
to see new cracks and fissures in their damaged homes. The results could have 
an impact on their insurance claims and factor into decisions on whether to 
rebuild, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were telling us that there wasn't any movement going on and not a day or 
two before that meeting the doors to my garage popped clean off their hinges," 
said Rich Deitrich, whose badly damaged home is on Sabina Circle. "Something's 
wrong with that conclusion, so a lot of the neighbors got together and let the 
city know what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 The study by a state geologist examined the stability of the soil deep beneath 
the surface but did not look at the potential for soil movement near the ground 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in remarks to city officials, the geologist acknowledged that there 
could also be gaps and cracks at the surface, and that localized movement could 
still be occurring. As soil moves to fill in those gaps, homes in the area 
could shift, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After residents complained to the City Council that they believed the study 
was inadequate, the city decided to consider paying a private geologist to do 
another study of the area, focusing on the surface soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the study finds that there is still movement we may be able to identify 
what has to be done to correct that," said Mayor Greg Stratton. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents said they would prefer waiting for the results of the city's 
proposed survey before deciding whether it is safe to rebuild. According to 
Deitrich, some residents have already had their property inspected by 
geologists and have determined that the cost of shoring up the soil makes 
rebuilding prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Because problems on one person's property could affect their neighbor's, 
Stratton said the city may have to require that property owners shore up their 
land to protect neighboring homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we do if we find that a hole or a crack in one person's 
back yard is going to hurt their neighbor," he said. "I know insurance 
companies sometimes pay for soil surveys, but I don't know if they pay to pour 
dirt down a hole or if they pay to build retaining walls. So the obvious 
question is what will happen next, and I don't know that answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The intent of the city's study, Stratton said, would be to determine what 
residents need to do to stabilize their soil before they start to rebuild or 
repair their homes. Copies of the study would be made available to homeowners 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's survey would be paid for with money from a $5-million federal grant 
awarded to Simi Valley after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the soil survey, the council Monday will also consider spending 
$30,000 of the grant money to repair quake damage to the banks of the Arroyo 
Simi flood control channel. The council will also consider setting aside $1.5 
million of that fund for a low-interest loan program to repair quake damage not 
covered by other federal assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. at Simi Valley City Hall.

SOKA CAMPUS IS DELIVERED NEW SETBACK; CALABASAS: THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT 
REFUSES TO LISTEN TO THE UNIVERSITY'S ARGUMENT TO PREVENT SEIZURE OF ITS SCENIC 
245-ACRE CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court on Friday refused to hear arguments from Soka 
University, dealing the school yet another setback as it fights to prevent the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy from condemning its scenic Calabasas campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Without commenting on the case, justices declined to consider Soka's challenge 
of a 2nd District Court of Appeal ruling in which the conservancy was permitted 
to proceed with eminent domain proceedings against the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan said the school is considering whether to appeal 
yet again -- this time to the U.S. Supreme Court. "We believe our 
constitutional rights have been denied," Ourvan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But conservancy staff counsel Liz Cheadle was dubious, saying: "I have no idea 
how they are going to make a federal claim out of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Soka attorney Hodge Dolle said the school could take issue with the amount of 
time the case has spent in legal limbo. Formally launched in December, 1992, 
the condemnation proceedings have been on hold in Los Angeles County Superior 
Court as both sides slog it out in appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 The case stems from a fight between the school and some of its neighbors. Soka 
wants to expand its campus at the corner of Mulholland Highway and Las Virgenes 
Road into a liberal arts college, but state and federal parks officials want 
the land to be a visitors center for the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka administrators have offered to share the site with park officials but 
have rejected offers to sell the property outright. So late in 1992, the 
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority -- a subsidiary of the 
conservancy -- launched condemnation proceedings to seize 245 acres through 
eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka sued to stop the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the conservation authority has a joint powers agreement with park 
agencies in Ventura County, conservancy officials sought approval from the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors to launch condemnation proceedings, even 
though Soka's property is entirely within Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka lawyers argued that Ventura County officials overstepped their bounds and 
they sought to have the approval overturned. A Ventura County judge agreed and 
the conservancy appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the appeal court level, justices earlier this year sided with the 
conservancy and told Soka lawyers that the proper forum in which to raise their 
objections would be during condemnation proceedings in Los Angeles County, when 
a judge will decide whether the conservancy has the right to take Soka's land.

STRIKE ZONE A HOT TOPIC; BASEBALL: EITHER TOO BIG, TOO SMALL, TOO HIGH OR TOO 
LOW, IT'S ALWAYS A SOURCE OF CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER SCHMUCK, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The world is full of gray areas. That fuzzy line between right and wrong. That 
gap on the speedometer between 55 m.p.h. and the speed that gets you pulled 
over on the highway. Cleveland before they built Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The baseball world is full of them, too, and none has created more 
conversation and controversy than that theoretical polygon box known as the 
strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too big. It is too small. It is getting too narrow. It is far too wide. 
It is always changing. It hasn't changed in years. It depends entirely on who's 
doing the talking. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is certain. The amount of talk about the strike zone has increased 
dramatically this year, as the fans and the media search for the most logical 
explanation for the startling upturn in offensive production. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the strike zone getting smaller, or are the hitters just getting bigger? 
Inquiring minds want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody's just looking for the answer to all the home runs," said 
the Detroit Tigers' Mickey Tettleton, "but I've seen balls called strikes that 
shouldn't be and some called balls that should have been strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 The umpires say they are making no concerted effort to change the dimensions 
of the strike zone. The notion that there is some grand conspiracy to increase 
offensive production to benefit the new television contract was shot down 
during the "juiced ball" debate and has not resurfaced. The umpires say they 
are going about their jobs the same way they have for years, and have not been 
instructed to do otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been no conscious effort to change the strike zone in the last 
three or four years," said veteran American League umpire Jim Evans. "Three 
years ago, we experimented with calling the high strike in spring training, but 
nobody wanted it. That pitch is considered a mistake. What the pitchers want is 
a wider plate." 
</P>
<P>
 The hitters say the pitchers are getting that, so there certainly is no 
consensus on the supposedly shrinking strike zone. Umpires do appear to call a 
lot of strikes that are off the outside corner, though Evans says that is a 
perception that is exaggerated by the angle of the center-field camera and 
complicated by the popular notion that the entire ball has to be inside the 
imaginary plane that projects upward from the outer edge of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball doesn't have to be entirely on the plate, and the camera is 40 to 50 
feet off center," Evans said. "If it was perfectly centered, you'd be blocked 
out. You wouldn't be able to see the catcher because it would be right behind 
the pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 The umpires also say that the center-field camera gives a distorted view of 
the height of some pitches, which adds to the impression that they do not call 
anything above the belt a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "You watch on TV, and everything looks waist high and below," Evans said. 
"That's camera angle." 
</P>
<P>
 If the strike zone has evolved in the past few years, it may be a matter of 
shape rather than size. Some umpires -- perhaps in response to pressure to 
speed up play -- do appear to be trading the higher strike for a slightly wider 
plate. Instead of a vertical rectangle, the zone seems to have become more of a 
square. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely getting smaller," said California Angels left-hander Chuck 
Finley. "They talk about the juiced ball. It (the ball) might be a little 
harder, but the inside part of the plate has been taken away. That makes you 
approach the game a little differently." Difference of opinion 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting larger," said Angels hitting coach Rod Carew. "You look at some 
of those overhead camera shots and see balls six inches outside getting called 
for strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 There is the debate in a nutshell. Competing interests tend to view an issue 
from different angles, just as the television broadcasters are employing a 
slightly skewed view from that center-field camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say it's bigger and I can't say it's smaller," said Angels designated 
hitter Chili Davis, a surprising voice of reason in this polarized debate. "I 
think it's just inconsistent. I don't think an argument about the size of the 
strike zone is going to stand up if you've got hitters and pitchers both 
complaining about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Though no one will admit to a concerted effort to change the strike zone in 
the past few years, no one denies that it has evolved throughout the history of 
baseball. There was a time early in the 20th century when anything under the 
chin was considered a strike, but the top end of the strike zone now is about 
four or five inches above the belt. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time it clearly changed was when American League umpires abandoned 
"balloon" chest protectors in 1985. Before the chest protector was 
standardized, the American League generally was considered a high-ball league 
and the National League was considered a low-ball league. 
</P>
<P>
 The big, outside chest protectors forced American League umpires to stand 
right over the catcher and look straight down on the plate, which created a 
more vertical zone. The smaller, inside-the-shirt protectors allowed umpires to 
crouch down and view the pitch through the "slot" between the catcher and the 
batter, which seemed to widen the outside half of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the American League, the umpire would call anything up to the top of that 
chest protector," said Tigers manager Sparky Anderson, who managed nine years 
in the National League before beginning his 15-year tenure with Detroit. "Now, 
there's really no difference." 
</P>
<P>
 American League umpires concede that the different stance produced a 
significantly different strike zone, but that was nearly a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the AL umpires wore the outside protector, the strike zone was higher," 
said umpire Joe Brinkman, who has been in the league since 1973. "But I don't 
think it has changed recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what is happening is that you've got a lot of ex-pitchers in the 
broadcast booth who have been away from the game for a while and remember 
getting that (high) pitch. They are just telling it like it was when they were 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
 There was an abortive attempt to enlarge the strike zone three years ago, when 
then-American League president Bobby Brown sent out a spring training directive 
to the umpires to call higher strikes. The experiment did not get out of spring 
training, however, because neither the pitchers nor the hitters really wanted 
that pitch called. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds strange, but it's true. Pitchers did not want the high strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "They applied that new strike zone, giving pitchers the high strike, which we 
didn't want," Finley said. "I don't want that, because it gets hitters thinking 
about hitting up there." 
</P>
<P>
 The directive, which was spawned by the clamor to speed up games, quietly was 
rescinded before opening day and discussion of the strike zone diminished until 
the offensive explosion of 1994 rekindled the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no perfect strike zone. It is an imaginary space that exists in the 
mind of each umpire and has to be adjusted to fit a wide variety of hitting 
styles and stances. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at the rulebook and the diagram," said American League supervisor 
of umpires Marty Springstead, "but that guy (in the diagram) never moves. 
That's the perfect strike zone, but there are so many variables that go into 
the thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key thing to remember is, the strike zone only exists when the guy 
(hitter) is offering at the ball at the plate, not when he's standing there 
waiting on the pitcher. Rickey Henderson comes up from his crouch at that 
moment. Dave Winfield comes down." 
</P>
<P>
 The umpire has to adjust to each hitter -- and the hitters and pitchers have 
to adjust to each umpire -- which is nothing new in a game that is based on 
continual adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most pitchers say they don't care where the strike zone is, as long as each 
umpire establishes a consistent one. The hitters are a bit more legalistic 
about the dimensions, but they also know they must learn each umpire and adapt 
to his strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is this: It is a game played and officiated by human beings, 
each with a distinct style and personality. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not a perfect science, and no amount of tinkering or technology is 
likely to change that without affecting the very heart and soul of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was a better way to do this over the last 100 years," Springstead 
said, "they would have found it."

VALENZUELA BACK IN THE MAJORS; BASEBALL: PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES SIGN LEFT-HANDED 
PITCHER, WHO HAD BEEN PLAYING IN THE MEXICAN LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Valenzuela, who left major league baseball this season to pitch in 
Mexico, returned to the big leagues Friday when he signed with the Philadelphia 
Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, 33, will report to the Phillies on Monday, general manager Lee 
Thomas said. The left-hander was 10-3 this year for the Jalisco Cowboys of the 
Mexican League. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela was 8-10 with a 4.94 ERA in 31 starts for Baltimore last season. He 
was 149-128 with a 3.45 ERA in a 13-year career that started in 1981, when he 
won the Cy Young Award and rookie of the year honors with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending NL champion Phillies began the day in third place in the NL 
East, 11 games behind Atlanta. Philadelphia has lost starters Curt Schilling, 
Tommy Greene and Ben Rivera to the disabled list this year, and also traded 
away Terry Mulholland in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
 As of June 21, Valenzuela had a 2.70 ERA in 16 starts for Jalisco. He had 
eight complete games. He also recently pitched one scoreless inning in a game 
in San Antonio between the Mexican League all-stars and the Texas League 
all-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said the Phillies were desperate for pitching help and Valenzuela was 
"worth the gamble." 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't a lot of pitchers out there who can help your ballclub," he 
said. "With the problems we have in the rotation, we think this guy can help 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who was to pitch five innings in Mexico Friday night, will make 
his first Phillies' start Tuesday against Florida and will go again Sunday in 
Los Angeles against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had scouts talk about him and watch him," Thomas said. "Everybody knows 
how Valenzuela pitches. He has to have control." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Jim Fregosi declined to say which of the replacement starters the 
Phillies have been using -- Shawn Boskie, Bobby Munoz, Mike Williams and David 
West -- would be dropped from the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's going in, somebody's going out," Fregosi said. "When he arrives, 
we'll explain everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his trademark eyes-to-the-sky delivery, Valenzuela pitched with the 
Dodgers, Orioles and California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 To make room for Valenzuela on the 40-man roster, the Phillies designated Bob 
Wells of their Scranton-Wilkes-Barre farm team for assignment.

 Daniel Smith, a former roommate of Buckeye guard Greg Simpson, told police 
that Simpson, forward Charles Macon and another person threw bricks at him in 
his apartment on June 9. Smith told police he heard two to three gunshots as he 
fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Levering, an assistant city prosecutor, said his office did not plan to 
file charges because it was unable to substantiate the police report.

 Martin Dahlin put on a heady show Friday night and carried Sweden to the brink 
of advancing in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlin connected on two diving headers that helped bring his team from behind 
for a 3-1 victory over Russia, which played a man short for the last 40 
minutes. Sweden has four points in Group B with a game left against Brazil, 
which already has clinched a spot in the second round. Russia is facing almost 
certain elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Sweden's first World Cup victory in 20 years, since it beat Yugoslavia 
2-1 in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played good the whole game and created a lot of chances," Dahlin said. "We 
are very satisfied with this game today." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlin, who scored Sweden's late tying goal in a 2-2 draw with Cameroon, 
headed the Swedes in front 2-1 with a low glancing shot in the 60th minute. He 
powered in another header eight minutes from the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlin also received a yellow card in the 58th minute, his second of the 
tournament. He will be suspended for the game with Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a 50-50 ball and he was doing the same thing as I am, going for the 
ball," Dahlin said. "It doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Oleg Salenko put the Russians ahead with a penalty kick in the fourth 
minute and Tomas Brolin tied it on a penalty kick in the 39th. 
</P>
<P>
 Salenko's goal at the Pontiac Silverdome before 71,528 fans gave the Russians 
an unexpected early boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Ljung took down Alexander Borodiuk in the penalty area. French referee 
Joel Quiniou awarded the penalty, which Salenko stroked almost casually into 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes applied pressure to tie and Dahlin shook the Russian crossbar with 
a fierce drive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 39th minute, Sergei Gorlukovich was penalized for pulling Dahlin's 
shirt as the Swedish striker tried to reach the ball. Brolin drove the ball 
firmly into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 50th minute, the Russians lost Gorlukovich, who was ejected for his 
second yellow card of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 With the one-man advantage, the Swedes created many chances before Dahlin's 
first goal. Jonas Thern swung a pass from the left wing and Dahlin dived low to 
glance the ball into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The third goal was just as impressive, Kennet Andersson racing down the right 
and sending over a pass that Dahlin headed in with another lunge.

MARKET TURMOIL CLOUDS THE RECOVERY; AS DOLLAR FADES, SO DOES OPTIMISM; DOW 
LOSES 62 POINTS, BOND PRICES SKID AS RATE HIKE FEARS GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Stock and bond prices took another drubbing Friday after central banks 
worldwide failed in their effort to bolster the dollar against other 
currencies, thus enhancing fears that the Federal Reserve Board will again 
raise U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 62.15 points to 3,636.94 -- 
its worst daily decline since losing 72.27 on March 30, dropping the blue chip 
average to its lowest level in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the average's fifth loss in six sessions, during which the industrials 
have skidded 174.40 points, or 4.5%. This week alone, the Dow industrials 
suffered their worst pummeling since mid-October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers overall swamped gainers by nearly 5 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, but the session was not a rout. Big Board volume was a moderate 261 
million shares, well below the average daily turnover so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the credit markets, government bond prices skidded and their yields soared 
amid investors' expectations that the Fed will now try to prop up the dollar by 
raising U.S. interest rates for the fifth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond lost more than 1 1/4 points, or $12.50 
for every $1,000 in face value, while its yield jumped to 7.52% from 7.40% on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks came under pressure at the opening bell, with traders knowing that 
foreign stocks had already plummeted on news that the Fed and several other 
central  
</P>
<P>
 banks had been unsuccessful in propping up the dollar by directly buying the 
greenback in currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, after only 90 minutes of trading, the Dow had lost more than 50 
points, which activated the New York Stock Exchange's "circuit breaker" 
constraints designed to limit the market's volatility. The constraints stayed 
in place for the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big disappointment today is we had a concerted effort to support the 
dollar, and the currency traders won," said Gail M. Dudack, market strategist 
at S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York. "Now there's this whole pallor that just 
hangs over the market." 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar traded late in the day at 100.45 Japanese yen, down 0.80 yen from 
Thursday and near a post-World War II low. It was down 0.019 German marks at 
1.584, a one-year low. 
</P>
<P>
 With the greenback still in retreat, investors "are nervous that the Fed is 
going to have to raise interest rates to correct the decline in the dollar," 
said Stephen E. Keane, research director at the Robert W. Baird & Co. brokerage 
in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the dollar's weakness prompts foreign investors to dump 
dollar-denominated stocks in search of better returns from investments based in 
other currencies. Because they expect the Fed to drive rates higher in defense 
of the dollar, investors also pushed bond prices lower, which in turn lifts the 
bonds' yields. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also concern that if U.S. rates keep climbing, they will dampen the 
nation's and state's economic growth and lead to disappointing corporate 
profits, which could also push stocks lower. 
</P>
<P>
 After the opening plunge, stocks stabilized for much of the session but then 
resumed their decline in the final hour. Analysts said the moderate trading 
volume showed that many investors took to the sidelines, waiting to see what 
the Fed does next. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to rally in the middle of the day but couldn't," said Jeffrey 
Logsdon, head of equity research for Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles. "You really 
had a buyers' strike going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Not entirely. David Diamond, a small-stock specialist at Boston Co., noted 
that bargain-hunting traders snapped up several technology issues that had 
plunged a day earlier. Cisco Systems rose 1 1/8 to 22 1/8, Newbridge Networks 
gained 1 1/4 to 30 1/8 and Cabletron Systems recovered 1 1/2 to 86 1/2 after 
plunging 5 3/4 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the overall results were grim. The Nasdaq composite index, which took a 
beating Thursday as those technology stocks fell, lost another 7.06 to close at 
693.79, a 12-month low. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other averages measuring the broader market, the NYSE composite index 
fell 3.74 to 244.55, the Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 6.83 to 442.80, 
and the American Stock Exchange's market value index lost 4.95 to 426.30. 
</P>
<P>
 On the NYSE's active list, Compaq Computer fell 1 1/4 to 31, General Motors 
slipped 1/8 to 50 5/8 and PepsiCo lost 3/8 to 30 3/4, but Eastman Kodak rose 
1/4 to 47 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial issues fell for the second straight day amid expectations that 
rising rates will carve into their profits. First Interstate Bancorp fell 7/8 
to 74 5/8, Wells Fargo dropped 2 3/8 to 151 3/8 and Citicorp was off 1/4 at 38 
7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 The declines on foreign stock markets included Tokyo, where the Nikkei 
225-share average dropped 273.46 points, or 1.3%, to 20,766.75. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the Financial Times 100-share average tumbled to an 11-month low, 
losing 65.8 points, or 2.24%, to 2876.60. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX index 
fell 16.79 to 2005.31. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index fell 55.66 points, or 2.5%, to 2187.27.

GROCERY GARGANTUA; INDUSTRY EMBRACES MEGA-STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Manchester Avenue curves west from the Great Western Forum, an 
86,736-square-foot behemoth of a grocery store comes into view. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Vons Cos.' newest effort to lure shoppers in a fiercely competitive 
Southern California grocery market. On a recent Friday afternoon, the Inglewood 
store was teeming with people. 
</P>
<P>
 They squeezed tomatoes and filled medical prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 They read greeting cards in the stationery section and dropped off armfuls of 
dry cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 They waited in line at the Bank of America cubicle and window-shopped 
next-door at the Frame-n-Lens store. 
</P>
<P>
 At long wooden tables next to stacks of fresh produce, they ate pizza and 
chicken lo mein from the Pizza Classico and Panda Express stalls that, along 
with a barbecue restaurant and Vons deli, form a kind of mini food court 
against one wall of the supermarket, which opened in late May. 
</P>
<P>
 "This store is wonderful," gushed shopper Margaret Jamerson, who admired 
eyeglass frames while her husband visited the bank. The Jamersons have driven 
several times from their home near Torrance to shop at the Vons. "I have so 
many errands to run, it's a convenience to come here. People these days are too 
busy for anything but convenience," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what industry experts say is driving supermarkets to build 
these big "super-combination stores" -- akin to indoor strip malls -- where 
shoppers can obtain a variety of goods and services other than groceries. Some 
non-grocery segments are operated by the supermarket chain, others by 
independent vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole supermarket industry is consumer-driven, so supermarkets are going 
to respond to what customers want," said Sherrie Rosenblatt, a spokeswoman for 
the Food Marketing Institute in Washington. "Customers don't want to have to go 
anywhere else besides the supermarket to rent videos, ship packages, send 
faxes, get drugs and pick up a quart of motor oil. . . . They want one-stop 
shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 The Inglewood Vons also includes a travel agency, a party store and a shipping 
service. It's the Arcadia-based chain's fifth combination store to open in 15 
months and the first in the Los Angeles area. (The store fulfills part of a 
pledge Vons made after the 1992 Los Angeles riots to build more stores in 
underserved inner-city areas.) 
</P>
<P>
 Vons is copying an idea tried unsuccessfully in Southern California in the 
late 1980s by Salt Lake City-based Smith's Food and Drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's failed in part because it had too many of the combination stores, said 
Gary Giblen, an analyst with PaineWebber in New York. Vons said it is building 
combination stores only in selected areas, and Giblen noted that the 
familiarity of the Vons name might give the chain an advantage with the 
concept. Vons is Southern California's largest grocery store chain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts said, making a profit in the combination store is a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you build a store like this, it's really a roll of the dice," Giblen 
said. "The break-even point is a lot higher when there's a lot more fancy stuff 
built into the store. But the upside is that profitability is higher if the 
store works." 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood store manager Mike Courtis said business has been "outstanding." 
Vons executives wouldn't discuss specifics, but they said weekly sales at the 
Inglewood store have exceeded projections by 25%.  
</P>
<P>
 "The customer response has been great," Courtis said. "They say they are so 
thankful to have a store like this in their area."  
</P>
<P>
 Independent operators leasing space inside the supermarket also say business 
is good. Sales at Frame-n-Lens are running 70% higher than expected, manager 
Annie Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We exchange customers with Vons, and this way we get a lot more exposure," 
said Clark, who estimated that 40% of her customers are walk-ins from the 
supermarket. Frame-n-Lens' Vons location is only a quarter of the size of the 
former Inglewood Frame-n-Lens, but volume hasn't slipped, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get more walk-ins than any other Frame-n-Lens store, and that generates 
future customers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bank of America branch relies on Vons to supply 90% of its customers, 
manager Deedre Chachere-Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten quite a few new customers," Chachere-Hunt said. "Some people are 
even switching from other banks because of the convenience." 
</P>
<P>
 Panda Express has been ringing in sales of $2,000 a day and attracts patrons 
from nearby businesses in addition to shoppers, manager Joe Manahan said. Food 
items are 10 to 20 cents more expensive than in a free-standing Panda Express 
restaurant because operating costs are higher at the Vons store, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vons also has higher costs because of the size of the grocery department, said 
Don Beaver, president of the Sacramento-based California Grocers Assn. He 
estimated that the Inglewood store will have to attract as many as 35,000 
customers a week -- and that they will have to spend as much as $700,000, or 
$100,000 more than at an average-sized supermarket -- for Vons to break even. 
</P>
<P>
 But the super-combination store is the wave of the future, Beaver said. He 
estimated that in the near future, 10% of Southern California's 3,000 
supermarkets will be super-combination stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dublin-based Lucky supermarket chain has some stores with banks, dry 
cleaners, restaurants and cappuccino bars operated by outside businesses, 
spokeswoman Judy Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton-based Ralphs, which in the 1980s experimented with but ultimately 
scaled back its Giant superstores, does not expect to build super-combination 
stores. It tries to locate in strip malls to provide customers with services 
such as dry cleaning and eyeglasses, according to spokeswoman Julie Weeks.

CONSUMER ADVOCATES, REGULATORS CRITICIZE DISASTER INSURANCE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the Northridge earthquake intensifying the political pressure for a 
national disaster protection program, California insurance regulators and 
consumer advocates warned Friday against rushing into an industry-supported 
plan that they consider seriously flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Natural Disaster Protection Act now before Congress would shift 
catastrophe risk away from insurance companies and "dump the unprofitable 
perils on the government," Mark Rakich, legislative aide to Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi, testified at a special state Senate committee 
hearing at Burbank City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance industry officials at the hearing endorsed the Natural Disaster 
Protection Act as a long-term solution but repeated their calls for an 
immediate repeal of the California law requiring insurers that write homeowners 
policies to also offer earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Senate Insurance 
Committee and Democratic nominee for state insurance commissioner, called the 
hearing after several large insurers, including Farmers Insurance Group and 
20th Century Insurance Co., quit writing new homeowners and earthquake policies 
in California, citing huge losses from the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres is sponsoring legislation to temporarily prohibit other insurers from 
withdrawing. He noted that Florida enacted a similar ban when carriers tried to 
pull out after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The withdrawals are already affecting consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas McVarish, whose home in Granada Hills was badly damaged by the 
earthquake, told the panel that he got a letter from 20th Century notifying him 
that his earthquake policy will not be renewed when it expires in August. 
</P>
<P>
 But with his home in shambles, no other carrier will cover him. 
</P>
<P>
 McVarish asked for legislation to keep insurers from dropping policyholders at 
least until their earthquake damage is repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, in what he called a stopgap measure, Garamendi ordered the 
California Fair Plan -- the industry-financed high-risk insurance pool -- to 
extend its residential fire and earthquake coverage statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he took the action to make sure that there would be a carrier of last 
resort for people who couldn't find insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harvey Rosenfield, author of the Proposition 103 insurance rate rollback 
initiative, said the crisis is being manipulated by insurance companies as a 
way of steamrollering through rate increases to fatten their profits. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the industry did the same thing in the 1970s and 1980s, inventing 
crises in medical malpractice insurance and liability coverage for day-care 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake insurance revenue "is not and never has been adequate to cover the 
risk," Bill Gausewitz of Farmers testified. Since Farmers started writing 
earthquake policies in 1968, it has collected a total of $448 million in 
premiums. But its losses from the Northridge quake alone will exceed $1 
billion, Gausewitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may have lost a lot on earthquake, but maybe you made it up on auto and 
commercial" insurance, Torres countered. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and earthquake insurance must remain linked, he said, because 
earthquake coverage can never be profitable on its own in California and must 
be subsidized by other lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii, after Hurricane Iniki, and Florida, after Andrew, instituted 
stand-alone insurance pools to deal with hurricane risk, but they do not appear 
to be a solution, Torres said. If another bad hurricane occurs in Hawaii, for 
example, policyholders will be hit with a potentially huge surcharge to cover 
the victims' losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Garcia, attorney for the Consumers Union in San Francisco, criticized 
the federal Natural Disaster Recovery Act for placing a cap on potential 
insurance industry losses. As long as the government will handle all losses 
beyond a certain level, she said, there is no incentive for insurers to 
underwrite carefully or control expenses.

 Next time you stay at a motel, room service may come from the Golden 
Arches.McDonald's will soon begin test deliveries to about 20 roadside motels 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 A food service analyst said the idea is great but that one of the biggest 
potential problems will be getting the fries to the consumer before they get 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "If McDonald's is near the interstate, then they can serve a real good, hot 
product," said A.B. Albritton, a corporate relations official for the 
participating motels. "If they're far away, then that's a horse of a different 
color."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS; BURLINGTON AIR EXPRESS WILL 
BOOST FLEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burlington Air Express said it will add five freighter jets to its fleet in 
July, boosting total cargo capacity by more than 20%. The Irvine-based unit of 
Pittson Corp. will operate 28 aircraft after adding three versions of the 
Douglas Aircraft Co.DC-8 and two Boeing B-727 models to its fleet. Burlington 
said the new aircraft are needed to meet rising demand. The company said its 
first-quarter domestic shipment volume jumped 21%. North American revenue rose 
10% in 1993 and increased 19% in the first quarter this year. Burlington Air 
Express is a $1 billion worldwide cargo carrier. While headquartered in Orange 
County, the company does not operate its large jets from publicly owned John 
Wayne Airport because of a county government ban on cargo operations there.

U.S. FIRM MAY BUILD RUSSIAN NUCLEAR PLANT; ENERGY: GENERAL ATOMICS AGREES TO 
DEVELOP A FACILITY THAT WOULD BURN WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM TO PRODUCE 
ELECTRICITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Diego firm has signed a joint venture agreement with Russia's Ministry 
of Atomic Energy to develop an advanced nuclear reactor in Russia that would 
burn weapons-grade plutonium to produce electricity, the firm announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement by General Atomics creates the first joint venture by a U.S. 
company and Russia to find a private-sector solution to Russia's plutonium 
oversupply problem. That nation is seeking to dispose of its massive stockpile 
of plutonium without depriving itself of the electrical power produced by its 
nuclear weapons complex and the many jobs in its nuclear establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately held General Atomics is aiming for leadership of the world market 
for commercial nuclear power -- a moribund industry for the past decade that 
could be revived with new nuclear reactor designs, company executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be the leader in the design and systems integration of these 
reactors," said Walter Simon, General Atomics senior vice president. By some 
estimates, the market for such reactors could reach $50 billion to $150 billion 
over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Energy Department announced Friday that an agreement to end 
Russia's current plutonium production was ready for signing by Vice President 
Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement provides for study of how to replace the power produced by 
weapons reactors in Tomsk and Kranoyarsk. General Atomics hopes the study, 
along with parallel efforts at the Defense Department, will lead the U.S. 
government to endorse the General Atomics plan for a new reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 General Atomics, which employs 1,400 people in San Diego and another 1,400 at 
a subsidiary in Germany, has long been in the nuclear business. It has produced 
70 reactors, mainly for nuclear research. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike any existing commercial or military reactor, the General Atomics design 
relies on helium to cool the reactor core and drive a high-speed turbine. It is 
touted as a major advance in efficiency and safety because the reactor would be 
self-cooling in an emergency and produce little waste heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the consensus of experts that this is a meltdown-proof machine," Simon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reactor would burn plutonium pellets encased in graphite or ceramic, which 
would moderate the nuclear reaction and prevent a runaway chain reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 But the joint venture faces major financial hurdles. A large portion must be 
underwritten by the U.S. government, but the Energy Department has made no 
commitments.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, General Atomics has underwritten the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 General Atomics' Simon estimates the reactor would cost $525 million, cheap by 
nuclear standards, because of Russia's low construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department is still considering whether it favors burning or 
permanently burying about 50 tons of surplus U.S. plutonium.  
</P>
<P>
 Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary is said to be opposed to burning any plutonium 
in reactors.

 Scam Victimizes 700 Investors: The Securities and Exchange Commission said it 
got an order freezing the assets of Owen R. Fox of Playa del Rey and four 
associates who the agency contends defrauded more than 700 investors of about 
$21 million. The group told investors their money would be lent to companies 
holding accounts receivable from the federal government, and promised 
investment returns of 10% to 24% a year.The SEC alleged that some of the 
investor funds were used to buy bank obligations from foreign banks that in 
many cases did not exist. In truth, according to the agency, the operation was 
a Ponzi scheme in which early investors were paid returns out of money invested 
by subsequent victims. Of the $21 million taken in, about $15 million was 
misappropriated, SEC documents say.

 GM Fuel Tank Case Settlement Hits Snag: A Texas Court of Appeals reversed a 
lower-court approval of a settlement that would allow General Motors Corp. to 
distribute $1,000 coupons to 650,000 Texas owners of its 1973-87 Chevrolet and 
GMC pickups with "side-saddle" gas tanks that can explode if the vehicle is 
struck from the side.The side-saddle tanks are mounted outside the frame rails 
of the vehicle. GM said it is disappointed by the ruling in Texarkana and that 
it continues to believe the settlement approved last November is a good one. 
"We believe that the decision is wrong," GM said in a statement. "We intend to 
seek reconsideration and will appeal to the Texas Supreme Court if necessary."

COALITION LAUNCHES FREE IMMUNIZATION DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying children in Los Angeles County have one of the lowest vaccination rates 
in the nation, a business coalition this week launched what it described as the 
largest private sector immunization drive ever undertaken in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said it hopes to boost the county's 40% vaccination rate -- the 
worst among California's most populous counties -- by sponsoring more than 250 
free clinics in the San Fernando Valley. The program will be expanded 
countywide next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was applauded by county health officials still haunted by a measles 
epidemic that killed 40 children and hospitalized another 2,700 between 1987 
and 1991. Some children's health experts predict that another outbreak will 
strike in a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 For 2-year-olds who are fully immunized against measles, polio, mumps, rubella 
and other childhood diseases, Los Angeles County's vaccination rate is 
significantly below both the statewide and the national rates -- 48.5% and 
55.3% respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Health authorities blame the county's poor ranking on several factors, 
including its large population of toddlers, many immigrant parents who do not 
understand English, insufficient public health clinics and soaring vaccine 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, experts say, many parents in their 30s and 40s -- who had to wince their 
way through a few shots when they were young -- are unaware of how many shots 
must be administered these days for complete immunization. A number of the 
vaccines used today did not exist before 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents have this image of kids lining up at school for polio shots. They 
don't realize it takes 16 to 18 doses of vaccine," said Joseph Liu, director of 
policy for Children Now, an advocacy group. "It's a lot more complicated than 
people remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Immunization rates are particularly low among the county's poor, who often 
cannot afford to take time off from work for repeated visits to the doctor or 
cannot reach public clinics for free shots. And many illegal immigrants, 
fearing that they will be identified, are wary of taking their children to 
government clinics at all, experts say.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the cost of full vaccination has skyrocketed in recent years. 
Shots that cost less than $11 in the mid-1970s now are priced at more than 
$235, not including any charges to administer them, according to the Children's 
Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the private inoculation effort said they are not trying to take 
over for the county health department, but want to supplement its efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 "The county has done a fantastic job trying to reach these people, but they 
just don't have the resources," said Greg Waskul, a spokesman for Burbank-based 
UniHealth America, which operates hospitals in the Valley and is spearheading 
the drive, called Operation Immunization. 
</P>
<P>
 To kick off the effort, nurses gave free shots at a Northridge elementary 
school earlier this week, trying to stick needles as gently as possible into 
small children who promptly began screaming.  
</P>
<P>
 "I took Tylenol even before I came over," said Judee Stelly, a nurse who 
normally works in the emergency room at nearby Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Jess Ross of La Crescenta said he came to the school to take advantage of the 
free injections for his 20-month-old daughter, Mychelle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They run about $160 when you go to a private clinic," he said, adding that he 
has no health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Waskul said Operation Immunization will hold more than 250 clinics in the 
Valley over the next six months at elementary schools, McDonald's restaurants 
and the Volunteer Center in Van Nuys. Vaccines will be provided by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the organization plans a massive education campaign to inform 
parents of the potentially fatal consequences of not vaccinating their 
children. It hopes to enlist hundreds of local businesses, churches, synagogues 
and community groups to help disseminate brochures and sponsor lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 An ongoing education campaign is crucial because even if parents make sure 
their children get shots today, the next generation of parents must do the same 
for their children, Waskul said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is to inoculate the minds of parents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waskul said Operation Immunization has signed a contract with the Los Angeles 
Unified School District to run weekly clinics at seven schools and to 
eventually expand throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said many immigrants seem ingly are less wary of schools than of government 
health clinics, and most can easily walk their children to a neighborhood 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Shirley Fannin, the county's chief of communicable disease control, said 
the government was happy to get help from private business. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the county's low vaccination rate is partly attributable to its 
thorough reporting, but conceded that it ranks poorly compared to other large 
urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 On a statewide level, 48.5% of 2-year-olds are fully inoculated, but the rate 
varies considerably among ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites have the highest rate -- 58% -- followed closely by Asians at 56%, 
according to the California Department of Health Services. Forty-four percent 
of African Americans and 37% of Latinos are fully immunized, but only 22% of 
Southeast Asians are. 
</P>
<P>
 Waskul said a poor vaccination record should not be viewed as a problem only 
of low-income people and minorities, however. It cuts across all races and 
economic classes, he said, and some countries have a far higher rate than 
California. Mexico, for instance, vaccinates 96% of its 2-year-olds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Liu of Children Now said that because so few toddlers are properly vaccinated, 
and because measles often runs on a three- or four-year cycle, many health 
experts expect a resurgence in the next year or two. Vaccination Schedule 
</P>
<P>
 The following table shows the immunization schedule recommended for children 
by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It shows all the

A SOLDIER AND A SON; ARMENIANS EMBRACE WOUNDED INDEPENDENCE FIGHTER AS FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There is nothing much new in a soldier, wounded in one of the world's endless 
conflicts, coming to the United States for treatment as the guest of a group of 
concerned Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Artour Ovtchian, a 21-year-old Armenian, the goodwill gesture he is 
experiencing is the most important. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the efforts of Glendale's Armenian community, the largest outside of 
Asia, Ovtchian may again be able to walk more than a few steps, write, tie his 
shoes and, he hopes, rejoin the war that has twice almost taken his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the United States has not been fighting a war on its soil, it's very 
difficult for an American to understand my way of thinking," Ovtchian said, 
sitting in a chair in his hospital room and speaking through an interpreter. 
"Our national pride has been put to the test and for that reason, dying many 
times is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Ovtchian should know. In April, a single Azerbaijani rifle shot just beneath 
his hairline left him partially paralyzed on his left side. Now, his left arm 
hangs limply and painfully, although he has regained some movement below the 
elbow. He is able to walk short distances by dragging his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, he was almost left for dead when he was shot through the left 
side of his jaw, the bone blown clear out of his head. At the same time, 
shrapnel embedded in his chest punctured his lungs. Scars along his boyish face 
from bone grafts and the sun-shaped tracheotomy mark on his throat serve as 
reminders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a very handsome, clean-cut boy before the war," he said simply. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovtchian's chances of returning to the front lines are not good, doctors said. 
The conflict, only the latest in a century of wars fought by the Armenians in 
the name of autonomy, has claimed 15,000 lives since the mostly Armenian 
population of Nagorno-Karabakh, formerly part of the Soviet Union, asserted its 
independence from Azerbaijan six years ago . 
</P>
<P>
 A soldier since he was 16, Ovtchian said he plans to continue in a supporting 
role if he cannot return to the battlefield. But one day, he would like to be a 
lawyer and protect the rule of law in his new nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't enjoy the war condition and we have a lot of other problems as well," 
Ovtchian said. "I don't wish that your or any other city would suffer the way 
we have. And we are still suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 Ovtchian was brought to Glendale Adventist Medical Center by the Armenian 
National Committee, which has an office in Glendale, and the Armenian Cultural 
Foundation, based in Glendale. Those groups paid for his trip to Southern 
California. The hospital is absorbing the estimated $40,000 bill for Ovtchian's 
four- to five-week stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups helping Ovtchian said their efforts allow Americans of Armenian 
ancestry a chance to reach back, to connect with the old country and the 
much-abused compatriots their parents left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard not to recognize suffering, and when you recognize the suffering is 
the exact same as affected your family, you can empathize," said Dr. Steven 
Kamajian, Ovtchian's primary physician. 
</P>
<P>
 "You become very clannish when all four of your grandparents were orphans," he 
continued. "You approach anyone similar to you as family, and I approach this 
boy as part of my family."

2 ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARRESTED AT LANDFILL; SUNSHINE CANYON: PAIR CLIMB FENCE IN 
BID TO HALT THE DESTRUCTION OF OAK TREES AS DUMP OWNER PREPARES FOR EXPANSION 
OF SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest chapter of a decade-long battle, two members of a North Valley 
environmental group were arrested Friday afternoon for climbing a fence at the 
Sunshine Canyon Landfill north of Granada Hills in an unsuccessful attempt to 
stop the dump owners from cutting down 3,000 oak trees to expand it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Edwards, 63, and Edward You, 39, both of Granada Hills, were charged with 
trespassing by Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen other residents from nearby communities also protested as crews 
working for Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., the dump owner, removed the 
California live oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the neighborhood, and their elected city representatives, have 
for years been fighting a proposed expansion of the dump, which county 
authorities say is needed to accommodate the county's river of trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards was upset, she said, when Browning-Ferris began cutting the trees 
about 5 p.m. Thursday, less than an hour after a Los Angeles County oversight 
committee gave the company final permission to go ahead with the removals. The 
crews worked until about 9 p.m. Thursday and returned Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "BFI went right in and started destroying" the trees, she said. "They couldn't 
wait to get those bulldozers rolling." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Woodlock, a lawyer for the North Valley Coalition of Concerned 
Citizens, an environmental group, said she was stunned at how quickly 
Browning-Ferris began tearing out trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We assumed it would be at least Monday before they could start work," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning-Ferris spokesman Arnie Berghoff said, "We started right away because 
we had the authority to do so. This has been a long process that hasn't been 
terribly pleasant" for either nearby residents or Browning-Ferris, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now that it's over, we'd like to express our intent to be a good neighbor 
and a good corporate citizen to the surrounding community," Berghoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the protesters' arrests, Berghoff added: "They were all warned by 
the security guards. I made the decision to call police for one reason only. 
There are rattlesnakes up there. The only reason we did it was for their own 
safety."  
</P>
<P>
 The original Sunshine Canyon Landfill closed in November, 1992, because it was 
full. Since then, environmentalists and nearby residents have battled 
Browning-Ferris in the courts and before county officials to stop the 
expansion, which would prepare the dump to accommodate 17 million more tons of 
trash over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 County authorities, however, favor expansion of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunshine Canyon Landfill straddles the Los Angeles city line, with part of 
it in the city and part outside, in unincorporated county territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The county government resisted a lawsuit by the city and environmentalists who 
tried to secure a court order preventing the expansion on the county side of 
the border. Earlier this month, a state appeals court ruled that the expansion 
could proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, opponents of the dump say that even though they still have some options 
left, it may be too late to save the trees. Browning-Ferris hopes the landfill 
will start accepting trash in about six months.  
</P>
<P>
 "Here we talk about losing rain forests in South America and look what we're 
doing in our own back yard," said Lynne Plambeck of Santa Clarita. "The wind 
blows both ways, so I'm sure we'll get the air pollution too." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodlock said she went to Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday morning to 
apply for a temporary restraining order to keep Browning-Ferris from destroying 
any more trees until several legal issues are cleared up. That application was 
denied because Browning-Ferris wasn't given sufficient notice of the 
application, Woodlock said. 
</P>
<P>
 She plans to reapply for a restraining order Monday "if there are any oak 
trees left." 
</P>
<P>
 Other opponents of the dump, including Los Angeles city officials, said they 
were also considering further legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed to say the least that BFI has decided to proceed with 
clearing the land without having all the necessary permits it needs to do so, 
in our opinion," said Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritsker. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety may also issue 
a cease and desist order if department employees see BFI improperly using a 
dump access road located within the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The land the road is on is zoned for agricultural use, not trucks and 
bulldozers," Pritsker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berghoff said Browning-Ferris' next move would be to expand the dump on the 
city side and join the two landfills into one.  
</P>
<P>
 "But that's a political decision the City Council will have to deal with, 
probably later this year," said Berghoff. Browning-Ferris has already submitted 
an application for the proposed project to the city's Planning Department.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CHILDREN GET CLOSE LOOK AT TAR PIT EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 10-year-olds at a museum, there is a single, all-encompassing commandment: 
Don't touch. 
</P>
<P>
 So when tour guide Mary Ann Dunn pointed around a corner at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Natural History in Burbank and spoke the words "touch 
specimen," the 20 youngsters bolted before she could finish her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8- to 12-year-olds from a Burbank Parks and Recreation summer camp were at 
the museum -- which reopened last week after five months of earthquake repairs 
-- to take in some local paleontology. The exhibit, called "Treasures of the 
Tar Pit," has been touring the country for five years and is now back near its 
home of Rancho La Brea, where millions of ancient animal skeletons were 
discovered buried in tar in 1875. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the highlights of the tar pits," said Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit comes complete with tar, or asphalt, as is the proper term, 
according to Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling at a post that was sunk in thick black goo, one boy said what seemed 
to be on the minds of all Friday: "I wouldn't want to be trapped in tar." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit covers the Rancho La Brea area during the last Ice Age, about 
20,000 years ago, when viscous crude oil bubbled up through cracks in the 
bedrock, settling in shallow pools, and leaving asphalt when the oil 
evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 As Dunn explained to the campers and counselors, leaves and grass fell and 
camouflaged the pits. Unwary critters would then wander in and get stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Other animals would see those trapped and step in thinking they'd found a 
quick lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was millions of creatures, from thumb-sized lizards to huge 
American lions, being preserved in the goo. In a single two-foot cube of the 
asphalt on display, dozens of bones lie piled on top of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Also found was a single human skull -- the mere mention of which elicited a 
chorus of "Oooohs" -- believed to be that of a woman who died 9,000 years ago 
of a head wound. 
</P>
<P>
 While visitors to the permanent tar pit display at the George C. Page Museum 
in Los Angeles may have seen many of these exhibits before, this show does 
contain several new ones, said Dunn, including a mural by artist Mark Hallet 
showing more than 100 different animals and plants from the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the youngsters Friday morning were awed by the 20,000-year-old 
skeletons of creatures now extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love museums and science and stuff," said Andrea Dumas, 10. "They're so 
cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were less interested in the past. Rubbing furiously the only touchable 
bone -- a femur of a Harlan's ground sloth -- Ruben Vigil looked up at his 
friends with wide eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine if this was bigger and you were on a skateboard!" he exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 The show will be on display 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday until 
Sept. 5 at the museum, 555 N. 3rd St. in Burbank. Prices are $3.50 for adults, 
$2.50 for seniors and students, and $1.50 for children 5 to 12. Those under 5 
get in free. ERIC SLATER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; BOY, 16, LAUDED FOR USING CPR IN GIRL'S RESCUE 
</P>

 School was nearly out, but something made Jeff Stauffer sit up and listen 
closely to the lessons on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in his sophomore health 
class earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really paid attention, because I wanted to be able to do it right. I had a 
gut feeling that I was going to have to use it sometime soon," the 16-year-old 
Tarzana youth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometime soon" turned out to be this week. In a quick-thinking act officials 
credit with saving a child's life, the youth rescued a drowning 3-year-old girl 
from his apartment complex swimming pool and successfully put to use the 
first-aid techniques he had learned just a few weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something took over, like instinct," Jeff said Friday. "I didn't really think 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He was lounging by the pool Tuesday afternoon, enjoying a piece of watermelon, 
the radio and the freedom of summer when he looked up and saw a little girl 
floating face-down in the water. It was 3-year-old Brittney Whitaker. His 
sister, Jennifer, had been baby-sitting the child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she was just joking around," said Jeff. But then, "I realized she 
couldn't swim." 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately he vaulted into the water and pulled the toddler out. Her chest 
was still, her face blue. 
</P>
<P>
 The training Jeff had received kicked in. Turn her on her side. Let the water 
come out of her mouth. Tilt her head. Help her breathe with a breath of your 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "After about the third time, she started to breathe by herself," Jeff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics arrived. An ambulance rushed Brittney to Tarzana Regional Medical 
Center, followed by Kathy Stauffer, Jeff's mother, who had just pulled up from 
her office. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital, a nurse asked Stauffer how it was her son knew mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'He didn't. He just faked it,' " said Stauffer, who had no idea what 
Jeff had learned in his health class. "She said no, he's been trained somewhere 
because he did everything perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff's actions were so well executed that Brittney suffered none of the brain 
damage that can result from a prolonged lack of oxygen. At the hospital 
Wednesday, Jeff gave the girl a teddy bear, which she promptly named after her 
rescuer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He saved my daughter's life," said Katie Whitaker, Brittney's mother. 
"Nothing I could offer him could ever repay that. I'm totally in debt to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter is home now and doing fine, even asking to go in the water again, 
Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick said the city will 
commend Jeff for his level-headed actions at a ceremony next Friday. HENRY CHU

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; CITY PUTS OFF VOTE ON UTILITIES TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Agoura Hills City Council has postponed final approval of a controversial 
tax on the use of utilities to clear up technical language in the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 By a unanimous vote Wednesday, the council reaffirmed its approval earlier 
this month of a tax on the use of electricity, gas and telephone service and 
added to the measure "definitions of residential and commercial" users, said 
City Manager Terry Matz. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ordinance is given final approval next Wednesday, residents will pay a 
4% tax on utilities, and business owners, a 3.5% levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue expected from the proposed tax has been figured into the proposed 
1994-95 budget, which includes $270,000 in spending cuts and layoffs of four 
part-time and two full-time workers to help offset an estimated $1-million 
revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular Wednesday night meeting, the council also approved the layoff 
of a part-time employee responsible for citing such code violations as 
abandoning cars or improperly storing items on property visible to others. 
</P>
<P>
 This layoff, with those included in the budget, would leave the city with 16 
full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget is scheduled for approval July 13. KURT PITZER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 14 RECEIVE $972 FINES IN COCKFIGHTING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourteen men arrested last month at a Panorama City cockfight were fined $972 
each and placed on three years probation Thursday after pleading no contest to 
charges they participated in cockfighting. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15th defendant entered his plea Monday, said Rick Schmidt of the city 
attorney's office.Municipal Judge Alan Ellis barred the men from possessing 
roosters or cockfighting paraphernalia while they are on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors disturbed by noise summoned police May 29 to a house in the 8300 
block of Ranchito Avenue, where officers from the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Van Nuys Division found men counting money and a cockfight in 
progress in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also found 15 fighting cocks, including two that were seriously 
injured. Two other roosters already were dead. Fighting spurs, energy-enhancing 
drugs for the roosters, ankle ties and several firearms also were seized. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office identified the men as Simplicio Vargas, 31, the 
owner of the house; Ramon Castro, 40, of Arcadia; Gem Famatid, 41, and Josifino 
Guerarra, 58, of Carson; Marcelina Montero, 43, of Lake View Terrace; Nonito 
Jucaban, 44, of North Hills; Abelandor Valera, 44, of Granada Hills; Fred 
Palafox, 55, and Jun Dairo, 27, of Inglewood; John Belmundo, 23 of Burbank; 
Asterio Valera, 42, of West Hills; Macario Tadena, 33, of Arleta; and Melbert 
Tato, 18; Richardo Pasiliao, 43, and Enrique Paragas, 42, of Panorama City.  
</P>
<P>
 The roosters were turned over to the city's Department of Animal Regulation.

 Without commenting on the case, justices declined to consider Soka's challenge 
of a 2nd District Court of Appeal ruling in which the conservancy was permitted 
to proceed with eminent domain proceedings against the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan said the school is considering whether 
to appeal its case yet again -- this time to the U.S. Supreme Court. "We 
believe our constitutional rights have been denied," Ourvan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But conservancy staff counsel Liz Cheadle was dubious, saying: "I have no idea 
how they are going to make a federal claim out of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Soka attorney Hodge Dolle said the school could take issue with the amount of 
time the case has spent in legal limbo. Although formally launched in December, 
1992, the condemnation proceedings have been on hold in Los Angeles County 
Superior Court as both sides slog it out in appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a due process claim," Dolle said. "If you're going to have a 
fight, you might as well throw your weak punches as well as your strong ones." 
</P>
<P>
 The case stems from a long and tortured fight between the school and some of 
its neighbors. Soka wants to expand its campus at the corner of Mulholland 
Highway and Las Virgenes Road into a liberal arts college, but state and 
federal parks officials want the land to be used as a visitors center for the 
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka administrators have offered to share the site with park officials but 
have rejected offers to sell the property outright. So late in 1992, the 
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority -- a subsidiary of the 
conservancy -- launched condemnation proceedings to seize 245 acres through 
eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka sued to stop the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the conservation authority has a joint powers agreement with park 
agencies in Ventura County, conservancy officials sought approval from the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors to launch condemnation proceedings, even 
though Soka's property is entirely within Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka lawyers argued that Ventura County officials overstepped their bounds and 
they sought to have the approval overturned. A Ventura County judge agreed and 
the conservancy appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the appeal court level, justices earlier this year sided with the 
conservancy and told Soka lawyers that the proper forum in which to raise their 
objections would be during condemnation proceedings in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 During those proceedings, a judge will decide whether the conservancy has the 
right to take Soka's land. If the judge decides in favor of the conservancy, a 
jury will determine how much Soka should be paid for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The process can take several years and it is likely that any judgments will be 
appealed. AARON CURTISS

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; ACTIVISTS GAIN IN COPTER-NOISE FIGHT 
</P>

<P>
 Community activists have won a small victory in their long-fought battle 
against the noise from helicopters using Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Silver, president of the Homeowners of Encino, has received permission 
from the Federal Aviation Administration to print a petition in the Federal 
Register that calls for helicopters to maintain a minimum 1,000-foot altitude 
over populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The printing of the petition is only the first step in a long process that 
must be undertaken to get this type of regulation adopted. But it's progress -- 
last year the FAA denied the request to print the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA changed its mind, Silver said, after he provided newspaper clips and 
other indications that helicopter noise was an issue for the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents living near Van Nuys Airport have for years complained about noise 
from helicopters and airplanes. A loose coalition of homeowner associations 
from Benedict Canyon, Sherman Oaks, Studio City and Valley Village have formed 
an organization called Stop the Noise! 
</P>
<P>
 Nigel Turner, president of Heli-USA -- a helicopter company that specializes 
in sightseeing excursions -- said the proposed regulation is unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
 "A helicopter is often required to fly lower, whether it be for the press, 
fire or emergency," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver's proposed regulation exempts police, fire and emergency helicopters 
from the altitude rule. 
</P>
<P>
 After Silver's petition is published, the public will be given a chance to 
comment on the proposal. Then the petition is evaluated by the FAA and if the 
agency approves of the idea, a "notice of proposed rule-making" is published in 
the register. 
</P>
<P>
 Several more steps would follow. The whole process takes about about 2 1/2 
years. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: OLDER COUPLES RENEW VOWS IN CEREMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their faces were lined, and some were physically or mentally disabled, but 
time had not robbed them of an important asset: their ability to show 
attachment to another human being. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why four elderly couples came together Thursday at the Woodland Care 
Center, a convalescent home on Corbin Avenue, to renew their wedding vows in 
front of gathered residents, their families and staff.  
</P>
<P>
 Also participating in the ceremony were nursing aide Nancy Lewis and her 
husband, Mel, who said their wedding vows for the first time two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a blazing hot sun, the five couples gathered in a semicircle around a 
rose-bedecked trellis that arched over Rabbi Bernard M. Cohen, who officiated 
at the ceremony.  
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Steele, 74, squeezed the shoulder of Irene, his wife of 28 years, as she 
sat in her wheelchair. When it was the women's turn to say "I do," Mary 
Munguia, who is mentally disabled, emphatically nodded her head.  
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the shade of a roof overhang, Steele, in a crisp, blue cotton shirt 
and navy slacks, and his wife, in a purple house dress decorated with pink and 
red flowers, talked about their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Steele, in her 70s now, was a visitor at Steele's aunt's home when they 
met in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that she was very pretty, very honest and straightforward -- 
characteristics that I like in a girl," Steele recalled. "We just hit it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Steeles can no longer live together -- he lives in Panorama City, 
she lives at the care center due to her physical disability -- the love that 
brought them together is still apparent. As the two talked to a visitor, they 
frequently patted each other's arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just looked at each other a lot," Steele said, explaining how their 
relationship had plenty of romance. As if on cue, Irene Steele's face took on a 
soft expression as she looked into his eyes.  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Sinclair, 77, said he participated in the ceremony with longtime 
companion Barbara Unger, 71, because "we've been together for 10 years."  
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Munguia, 66, decided to renew his vows in the hope that his wife, 70, 
who suffered a massive stroke in 1989, would be at least dimly aware of his 
love and devotion for her. 
</P>
<P>
 As her husband, Louis, stroked her arm, Gertrude Salle, 86, confessed that she 
agreed to be in the ceremony to help out the home's staff, who wanted to put on 
a fun activity for its residents. Louis Salle, 92, has had Alzheimer's disease 
for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "What good is it -- he doesn't know anybody," she said. "But I wouldn't let 
him go. I still love him." 
</P>
<P>
 The home's residents said they enjoyed the affair, which also included a 
bridal fashion show -- using family and staff members as models -- pink and 
white balloons, and a real wedding cake donated by Sherman's Plaza Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful, it's out of this world," said Catherine Kasprinski, 75, 
appreciatively taking in the organza and silk creations. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; WOMAN JAILED OVER PROSTITUTION LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood woman became the first person to be jailed for violating new 
regulations that put restrictions on convicted prostitutes in certain San 
Fernando Valley neighborhoods, Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Judge Alan Ellis sentenced 18-year-old Melissa Ong to 45 
days in jail for violating a two-year probation, which she received following 
her conviction for prostitution on May 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Laura Van Eyk, who filed the case against Ong, called it a 
first step in the program's attempt to remove prostitutes from high-crime 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good indication that this effort's going to work," said Van Eyk. "This 
program basically keeps the prostitutes from moving on to another hot spot in 
the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Ong had been given a map marked with areas of the Valley where she was 
forbidden to engage motorists in conversation or solicit or accept rides from 
motorists. She also was not supposed to be sitting with a motorist in a parked 
vehicle in those areas between the hours of 5 p.m. and 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 After being released on probation May 26, Ong was arrested June 19 at 
Lankershim Boulevard and Erwin Street, the same location where she was arrested 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The location was among those restricted under the mapping program. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover vice officers with the Los Angeles Police Department made the 
arrest after watching Ong approach vehicles being driven by male motorists, 
according to Van Eyk. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35 convicted prostitutes on probation have been ordered to obey the 
mapping program's restrictions, Van Eyk said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

LINK CONFIRMED BETWEEN MURDER SUSPECT, BONES FOUND; CRIME: SKELETAL REMAINS IN 
CASTAIC RAVINE IDENTIFIED AS BELONGING TO WINNETKA MAN WHO POLICE BELIEVE 
FATALLY SHOT HIS FRIEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The skeletal remains found in a pickup truck at the bottom of a ravine earlier 
this week do belong to a murder suspect who police believe fatally shot a man 
at a Northridge home last year, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Douglas Snyder of Winnetka, who was 29 when he was last seen about 17 
months ago, was identified by coroner's investigators by comparing his dental 
records with the remains found Monday at the crash site north of Castaic, said 
coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier said that although investigators combed the ravine for other clues, 
they found only a skull, some rib bones, and a lower jaw in and around Snyder's 
blue truck. And a rusty gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not have an entire skeleton, but we were able to match dental X-rays 
with the lower jaw found at the wreck," Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier said animals probably ate the missing bones. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's department is still trying to determine a cause of death, 
although a police detective said he believes Snyder may simply have died in the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Since forest rangers spotted the bones off Templin Highway, authorities have 
suspected that they were Snyder's remains because the wrecked truck was his. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 14, 1993, police think Snyder fatally shot his friend, Christ James 
Wetzel, 27, in a friend's garage while the three were fixing a car. Before the 
shooting, Snyder and Wetzel had argued about Snyder's sister -- who was 
Wetzel's girlfriend, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Detective Tom Broad said Friday that investigators believe 
Snyder fled after the shooting in his green pickup truck, heading north on 
Templin Highway in the rain. Snyder was never seen after the night of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad said he believes Snyder went off the side of the roadway and into the 
ravine on the night of the shooting. But authorities do not know if the 
accident occurred because Snyder lost control of the truck on wet pavement, or 
whether he committed suicide, Broad said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it happened the night of the murder," he said. "We've asked the 
California Highway Patrol to come in and re-create the accident as it occurred, 
but we may never be able to tell what really happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are also trying to determine if the rusted, broken .357 handgun they 
found in Snyder's truck was the weapon used to kill Wetzel, Broad said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gun is in such bad shape we might not be able to put it back together and 
fire a bullet out of it," he said. "But we'll try anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though police must wait for that ballistics check, Broad said he thinks a 
nearly 1 1/2-year-old homicide case is on the verge of being solved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we are going to reclaim our warrants and clear a murder case," 
he said.

D.A.'S OFFICE CAN PURSUE SEX CASE AGAINST JUDGE; COURT: MOTION BY DEFENSE 
LAWYERS FOR STANLEY SAMUEL FEINSTEIN IS DENIED. HE IS ACCUSED OF MOLESTING 
FEMALE ATTORNEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office can continue to prosecute a 
judge accused of sexually molesting a female attorney in his Van Nuys chambers, 
a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a hearing Friday, Judge Robert J. Perry denied a motion by defense 
attorneys to remove the county prosecutor from the case against workers' 
compensation Judge Stanley Samuel Feinstein, 61. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, charged with two misdemeanor counts of unlawful touching and false 
imprisonment, is accused of fondling a 40-year-old attorney during a March 28 
visit to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the dispute is a memo circulated at the woman's law firm, 
stating that the district attorney's office had warned against any discussion 
of her case, which defense attorneys contended prevented them from interviewing 
her co-workers to establish her credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just something about this case that doesn't really seem to be a 
search for justice," said Philip Israels, Feinstein's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In considering Israels' arguments for removing local prosecutors, Judge Perry 
found that it was unlikely that Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Straughn, who is 
prosecuting the case, would exercise her authority irresponsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Straughn said she was not surprised by the judge's rejection of the defense 
request. "I knew there was nothing there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had originally charged Feinstein with felony counts of false 
imprisonment and sexual battery. Those counts were reduced to misdemeanors 
following a preliminary hearing last month, prompting prosecutors to file a 
motion to have the felony charges reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito is expected to rule on that 
motion Monday. Meanwhile, another Municipal Court judge is scheduled to set a 
trial date on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's testimony in the hearing to determine whether local prosecutors 
should continue to handle the case focused on the memo distributed at the 
alleged victim's law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman testified that she had asked a prosecutor whether it was all right 
for her to discuss the case at work and that she was advised not to. 
</P>
<P>
 She stated that she passed the information on to her supervisor, who, on his 
own authority, issued a memo advising employees not to discuss her case with 
co-workers or family members. The memo also warned that the district attorney's 
office would consider leaks to anybody outside the office as separate 
transgressions -- a threat which the district attorney's office apparently 
never made. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney who authored the memo testified during the hearing that he had 
distributed it mainly to prevent information leaks to a competing law firm, for 
reasons unrelated to the molestation charges. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that warning which upset defense attorneys, who contend that as a 
result of the memo they have been unable to interview the female attorney's 
co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the implications of that memo are outrageous," Israels said, 
referring to the implied threat of prosecution of the woman's co-workers.

FEINSTEIN, FEMA DIRECTOR TO TOUR 'GHOST TOWN' APARTMENTS; RECOVERY: RAVAGED 
NEIGHBORHOODS IN SHERMAN OAKS AND SYLMAR TARGETED. CITY WANTS AGENCY TO PAY FOR 
FENCING AND SECURITY MEASURES AT VACANT BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to secure additional financial relief, Los Angeles city officials will 
give Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Federal Emergency Management Agency Director 
James Lee Witt a first-hand look Sunday at quake-damaged "ghost towns" in the 
San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 The tour of ravaged neighborhoods in Sherman Oaks and Sylmar is the latest 
effort by city officials to prod FEMA into paying for fencing, private guards 
and other security measures to keep squatters, vandals, scavengers and drug 
users out of vacant quake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of city department heads has identified 13 so-called "ghost 
towns" in the Valley, Hollywood and the Mid-City areas where empty apartment 
buildings and condominiums have become a source of crime and blight. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Feinstein representatives and city officials say they have approached 
FEMA about providing the funding needed to provide security for the ghost 
towns, FEMA spokesman Morrie Goodman said Friday that no formal request has 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that FEMA would consider paying such costs once such a request is 
made. "We will proceed with due diligence on any request," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein representatives were optimistic that Witt's visit will result in the 
approval of funding for the ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the senator's hope that this visit will provide an opportunity to come 
to an agreement between FEMA and the city on a solution to these ghost towns," 
said Feinstein spokesman Bill Chandler. "FEMA wants to help." 
</P>
<P>
 At the behest of Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose northeast Valley district 
includes two ghost towns, Witt agreed to investigate the problem while he is in 
town meeting with local FEMA officials about the earthquake recovery effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public safety of the community is at stake," said Alarcon. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt and Feinstein will also visit quake-devastated San Fernando Elementary 
School to offer a way school officials can more quickly obtain funding to pay 
for quake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of ghost towns prompted city officials Tuesday to authorize 
police sweeps of vacant quake-damaged buildings. The buildings will be boarded 
up and patrolled by private security guards after the sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the effort, the task force identified about $240 million in local 
and federal money that was set aside for other uses, such as housing and 
community development. Some of the money will be used for loans to property 
owners who want to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials plan to ultimately pass the cost of the security measures 
on to the landowners unless FEMA is willing to step in and pay for such costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt is likely to make that decision after he drives through a cluster of 
vacant quake-damaged buildings on Hubbard Street in Sylmar and tours a ghost 
town on Colbath Avenue in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is happy with the locale of the visit. An aide for 
Councilwoman Laura Chick, whose West Valley district includes a ghost town in 
Reseda, was piqued that Witt and Feinstein will not visit that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm perplexed that they would not come to visit a ghost town in the west San 
Fernando Valley, the epicenter of the quake," said Chick field deputy Eric 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Councilman Hal Bernson, whose northwest Valley district suffered 
most of the quake damage, echoed those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unfortunate that they don't have the time to visit council district 
12," said Bernson aide Francine Oschin. "We have a lot of problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But she added: "If something good comes from this, it will be good for all of 
us."

AUTOPSY FAILS TO REVEAL CLUES IN WOMAN'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An autopsy has failed to help authorities identify a woman whose body was 
found in an open field Wednesday, or to determine how she died, according to 
the coroner's office.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman's body was discovered by a boy riding his bicycle along a dirt 
road.Authorities believe the woman was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Carrier, a spokesman with the coroner's office, said Friday's autopsy 
was inconclusive in large part because the body was so badly decomposed. He did 
say, however, that gunshot wounds were not found on the body. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step, Carrier said, is for toxicology tests to be completed. Results 
from those tests, which check for alcohol and drugs, may take as long as eight 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who is thought to have died several days before she was discovered, 
is believed to be either white or a light-skinned Latina. She was found between 
Sierra Highway and 10th Street East south of Avenue R.

few weeks and months have been trying for us all who care about and for the 
children of our community. 
</P>
<P>
 "These events have caused me much agony. The stress and distress caused by 
actions of the board and of some selfish self-seeking community persons has 
been so great that my health is in jeopardy. My family has been affected as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 She continued, "I will no longer subject myself and my family to such 
anguish." 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher for more than three decades, Spry cast the sole dissenting vote when 
the board decided in late April not to administer the controversial California 
Learning Assessment System test. 
</P>
<P>
 Spry's departure is not the only change the board may face. Two members of the 
board, Laurie Browning and Joyce Field, were recently notified that a recall 
drive has been initiated against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Spry, 61, has been on the board since January, when she was appointed to fill 
a vacancy left by the resignation of Brian Sherwood. She said it was difficult 
to make the decision to resign but that she will continue to be involved in 
local education issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just got to be more than I felt I could handle," she said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Tom Brown said the board has not yet decided how it will fill Spry's 
position.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CAR THIEF ESCAPES FROM JAIL DURING THE NIGHT; 
CASTAIC: RALPH ROGERS APPARENTLY CRAWLED THROUGH HOLE IN FENCE AT A 
MINIMUM-SECURITY SECTION OF FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted car thief escaped from a minimum-security facility at the county 
jail early Friday morning, apparently by crawling through a hole in a chain 
link fence, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Rogers, 36, was last seen in his bunk during the midnight count at the 
Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, said Deputy Patrick Hauser of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. Deputies discovered he was missing during a 
similar count at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "A hole was discovered in the fence behind his dorm and that's believed to be 
his avenue of escape," Hauser added. 
</P>
<P>
 The minimum-security facility houses inmates convicted of relatively minor 
crimes in military-style barracks, said Lt. Ed Dvorak, watch commander of the 
facility. He said deputies patrol the grounds, but are not stationed inside the 
inmates' unlocked dorms. 
</P>
<P>
 A fence around the facility provides additional security, but Rogers somehow 
created a hole in the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not exactly sure if he was able to cut it or break loose a weld," he 
said. Rogers was arrested April 6 and booked on numerous misdemeanor warrants 
and a felony warrant for auto theft, Hauser said. He was convicted and 
sentenced to a year in prison on the vehicle theft charge, but was scheduled 
for release Nov. 25 because of sentence reductions, such as time off for good 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies searched the 2,800- acre, five-jail Pitchess facility and notified 
local law enforcement officials, but were unable to find Rogers, Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers is described as a white male, 6 feet tall, 190 pounds, with brown hair, 
brown eyes and a thick dark mustache. He was last seen wearing a light green 
county jail jumpsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been 10 escapes from Pitchess this year, nine from the Ranch 
facility Rogers fled and one from the medium-security South facility, said 
Errol Van Horne, operations lieutenant of Pitchess. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're talking about generally are walkaways," he said. "They perform 
work outside the fences . . . and they walk away from their work assignment." 
</P>
<P>
 No inmates have escaped from the jail's three high-security facilities in 
recent years, Van Horne added. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the last four escapees from the Ranch facility have been caught, Dvorak 
said. He said he does not have exact figures on other escaped inmates, but 
police catch up with most of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless they leave the country we usually recapture them," he said.

 MERGING SYNAGOGUES: The name Shomrei Torah Synagogue was chosen by members of 
two Conservative Jewish congregations in the west San Fernando Valley who will 
mark their recently announced merger with an inaugural service Friday in West 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hebrew name, which means "Guardians of the Torah," was selected Thursday 
night in a joint membership meeting of Congregation Beth Kodesh of West Hills, 
which will serve as the main meeting place, and Temple Beth Ami of Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 The 850-member congregation is affiliated with the Conservative branch of 
Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Eli Schochet of Beth Kodesh will be the pulpit rabbi and Beth Ami's 
Rabbi David Vorspan will become administrator of the congregation. Both rabbis 
and Cantor Avrum Schwartz will officiate in Friday's special Family Shabbat 
service at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The rites will feature symbolic elements of a Jewish wedding with Torah 
scrolls from both synagogues placed under a chupa , the traditional canopy 
under which Jewish brides and bridegrooms stand. Participants will sing and 
dance around the canopy. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple Beth Ami, which had been losing membership as the demographics of 
Reseda changed, is the older of the two, dating back 45 years. Beth Kodesh has 
been in existence 36 years. 
</P>
<P>
 PRESBYTERIAN MEETING: Reports on the recent national convention of the 
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) will be made Tuesday at a meeting in Chatsworth by 
the Presbytery of San Fernando's two voting delegates. 
</P>
<P>
 The 206th General Assembly in Wichita, Kan., was filled with bitter debate 
over Presbyterian involvement in a controversial feminist conference last 
November, but delegates ended the meeting last week with the surprise adoption, 
516 to 4, of a report urging reconciliation of the opposing sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-church presbytery, which will convene at 3 p.m. Tuesday at St. Stephen 
Presbyterian Church, 20101 Devonshire St., will hear from delegates Chuck 
Osborn, associate pastor of La Canada Presbyterian Church, and Helen Weaver, a 
member of La Crescenta Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR: Singer-producer Kevin George will star in a 
performance Sunday of the musical "Jesus Christ Superstar," by Andrew Lloyd 
Webber and Tim Rice, at Glendale Presbyterian Church, 125 S. Louise St. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance, directed by Rudy Hovsepian, starts at 6 p.m. A donation of 
$15 is suggested. For information, call (818) 982-4355. 
</P>
<P>
 RADIO TUNES: Pop songs of the 1940s will be featured in the fourth annual 
summer pops concert Sunday at Glendale City Seventh-day Adventist, 610 E. 
California Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert by the church's Pops Chorale, directed by John T. Dennison, will 
begin at 5:30 p.m. Tickets cost $5.99 per person and include a light buffet in 
the price. For reservations and information, call (818) 244-7241.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; 'MARCHES FOR JESUS' PARTICIPANTS EXPECTED TO BE IN STEP 
WITH RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Marches for Jesus" taking place today in 170 countries and 500 U.S. locales 
-- including Santa Clarita, Glendale and Chatsworth -- aren't quite lock-step 
martial parades, but the national organizers do expect a lot of conformity. 
</P>
<P>
 The controlled nature of the celebrations is considered one reason why the 
annual mile-and-a-half jaunts have caught on since the first March for Jesus 
seven years ago in London and the 150 marches in the United States two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rules are many: Marches must start at 10 a.m. in each time zone and be 
accompanied by music written and recorded specifically for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The only banners and flags permitted are those designed by the March for Jesus 
headquarters in Austin, Tex. Also "no group is allowed to identify itself," 
reads the Marchers' Code of Conduct. "We are not here to promote a church or 
denomination -- we are here for Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasts, drawn mostly from evangelical and charismatic congregations, are 
also discouraged from using the occasion to espouse sociopolitical causes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are five prayers to be said at the end of the march. The wording is 
printed in the official booklet. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, says Judy Lind, coordinator of the Glendale march and a participant 
in one last year in Pasadena, "there really is freedom and spontaneity in the 
marches and worship" despite the prerecorded music and many precise rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Lind said she expects about 1,000 marchers from two dozen congregations, 
including her own Glendale Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, organizers of the Santa Clarita march, which drew an estimated 5,000 
marchers a year ago, plan to deviate from the wording and allow 10 pastors to 
offer prayers of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think there is room for flexibility," said Cathy Love, coordinator of the 
Santa Clarita march, which has 52 congregations and ministries backing the 
parade today, compared to three dozen churches last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita march will proceed past City Hall and end up near county 
offices, partly because the route and assembly area are suitable and partly 
because the marches feature prayers for government leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Rev. Tom Pelton, a former Austin, Tex., pastor who is 
national coordinator, has repeatedly stressed in statements that the event is a 
celebration with "no political agenda, no social agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 Why are the regulations for participation so strict? 
</P>
<P>
 "The music and chants are important to maintain consistency" no matter where 
the march is taking place, Pelton said in a telephone interview. The lyrics by 
composer Graham Kendrick are doctrinally acceptable to traditional Christians 
who don't want "to compromise beliefs for the sake of unity," Pelton said. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the two dozen Los Angeles-area marches, the music will come from 
the march's official radio station, KKLA-FM, a Christian station in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs, proclamations and prayers emphasize Jesus as "Lord of all" and his 
"awesome presence." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want it to come across as an in-your-face triumphalism," Pelton 
said. "As we gather in massive marches we want to make sure we incorporate a 
sense of humility and repentance." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Pelton recently had second thoughts about a portion of the prayer 
script that asks forgiveness for what it calls U.S. injustices to Native 
Americans: 
</P>
<P>
 "We displaced the native people, broke covenants with them, oppressed and 
enslaved people and enforced injustice. Now we reap a harvest of violence. 
Justice has fallen in the streets. Only you, Lord, can forgive us and heal our 
land." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent last week to local coordinators, Pelton said, "The wording of 
the prayer seems to have left room for misunderstanding and speculation about 
the point that is being made." He asked that another statement, which reflects 
the common tenet among evangelicals that America has a special relationship 
with God, precede that portion: 
</P>
<P>
 "America was founded on Christian values and principles. Yet, our history has 
been marked by tragedy and violence." 
</P>
<P>
 The attention to what he regards as sins against Native Americans has been a 
strong theme in recent years of evangelical leader John Dawson, who serves as 
international director of Youth With a Mission from an office in Lake View 
Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson also chairs the U. S. advisory board for the March for Jesus, but will 
be unable to take part in a march this year. At march time, Dawson will be 
between an Atlanta conference and the Christian Booksellers national convention 
in Denver, promoting his newly published book, "Healing America's Wounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jack Hayford, senior pastor of Church on the Way in Van Nuys, is also 
on the advisory board. But Hayford and his church were heavily involved in the 
June 1-5 Luis Palau Crusade that was supported by volunteers from nearly 200 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our resources went into the crusade and we have referred callers to 
the marches planned in Santa Clarita and Pasadena," said a church spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 A large march will begin at Will Rogers Park in South-Central Los Angeles, 
said Brenda Strauch, Southern California coordinator. Other marches are planned 
in Torrance, Long Beach, Huntington Beach and several in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The only march planned in the San Fernando Valley, excluding Glendale, will be 
a small effort in Chatsworth, which will begin at Chatsworth Foursquare Church 
at 10210 Canoga Ave. and proceed along Devonshire Street to Mason Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get started until late and the churches I talked to were involved 
with follow-up to the Palau evangelistic crusade," said Denise Dunbar, the 
Chatsworth coordinator and a member of the Foursquare church. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lind, the Glendale coordinator, was hopeful that the march from Glendale 
Presbyterian Church at 125 Louise St. to Glendale High School will launch an 
annual event. The participating congregations include Chinese, Armenian, 
Filipino and Arabic churches and range from Lutheran to Pentecostal in 
theology. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things which have tended to divide us are falling away and we are finding 
unity in praising God together," Lind said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FORMER PRIEST GIVEN 12-YEAR PRISON TERM; 
COURTS: ROBERT L. DUCKER ADMITTED MOLESTING TWO BOYS WHO ATTENDED HIS CHURCH IN 
PALMDALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Episcopal priest who admitted molesting two boys who attended his 
Palmdale church has been sentenced to 12 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Ducker's sentence, handed down Thursday by Lancaster Superior Court 
Judge Haig Kehiayan, was the maximum permitted under a plea agreement reached 
last month with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 John K. Spillane, head deputy district attorney in Lancaster, said his office 
requested the maximum sentence because molestations occurred on a number of 
occasions and because Ducker had violated a clergyman's special position of 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "The acts took place over a long period of time," the prosecutor said. "They 
were not just incidental sexual contact. . . .Due to the nature of this 
offense, we felt that 12 years in state prison was appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Ducker, 63, was arrested in March on charges that he molested two youths, who 
are now 15, over the past two years while serving as vicar of Christ the King 
Mission in Palmdale. At the time of his arrest, Ducker resigned his post and 
informed the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles that he had been involved in 
sexual misconduct with minors, a diocesan spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said an older brother of one of the victims learned about the 
incidents and reported them to his mother, who contacted authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Ducker was charged with eight counts of committing various sex acts 
with minors, and he faced up to 20 years in state prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 But last month, in an agreement with prosecutors, Ducker pleaded no contest to 
three counts of lewd conduct with a child, punishable by no more than 12 years 
in prison. He also agreed to cooperate with deputies in their investigation of 
other child molestation cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducker's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Roy Wallen, could not be reached for 
comment Friday. But he said earlier that Ducker entered the plea partly to 
spare the boys the trauma of testifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's expressing remorse concerning the incidents," Wallen said last month. 
"It's appropriate to resolve the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel R. Martinez, head deputy public defender in the Lancaster office, said 
Wallen argued unsuccessfully that Ducker should be placed on probation, not in 
prison, because of his record of community service, his age and his health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt it was a harsh sentence," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office, said the punishment did not "seem like an unusually high sentence." She 
pointed out that a single count of lewd conduct with a child carries a maximum 
sentence of eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne S. Howard, chief of staff for the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los 
Angeles, said her organization has assigned a priest who is also a mental 
health professional to help Palmdale church members who were upset by the 
Ducker case. She said the families of the victims in the case "did not accept 
our offer of counseling assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very sad for all of us," Howard said of the case.

THEATER REVIEW; IS THIS THE SANDRA SHE WANTS TO BE?; BERNHARD CALLS 'EXCUSES 
FOR BAD BEHAVIOR' A WORK IN PROGRESS. SO FAR, HER SINCERITY AND SINGING ARE 
LESS EFFECTIVE THAN CONFRONTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Half an hour after the scheduled curtain time, Sandra Bernhard's Thursday 
night show at the La Jolla Playhouse's Mandell Weiss Theatre hadn't yet started 
when a techie came out among the guitars and drum set to check the mikes. The 
audience was in the mood to take out their lighters, when the house lights 
finally dimmed. Was this a rock concert, a parody of a concert, an evening of 
stand-up with music or a piece of performance art? Answer: It's whatever 
Bernhard says it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuses for Bad Behavior, Part I" -- and when did Bernhard ever need any 
excuses? -- is a glimpse into where this idiosyncratic and, to many, bafflingly 
confrontational, performer is heading. Having its "world premiere" in La Jolla 
through tonight, the show will begin touring in September in conjunction with 
the release of her album. 
</P>
<P>
 Onstage, and with her trademark menacing tone, Bernhard warned any critics 
present that this show is a work in progress and should be treated as such. Her 
anxiety is clearly a case of projection: When she gets going, no one is a more 
vicious or funnier critic. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking fabulously toned in a silver sheath mini dress (or is it a slip?) and 
with her hair in a curly bob, she demolished a Vanity Fair writer simply by 
reading aloud from the Sylvester Stallone cover story, which contained, among 
other adoringly lascivious descriptions, "his little rosebud of a mouth" and 
"the hair-raising brevity of his cotton shorts." Bernhard raises contempt to a 
high art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunset Boulevard" also took a bruising. In Bernhard's hilariously 
uncharitable imitation of Glenn Close, whom she calls "scary," the star sang, 
"Sunset Boulevard/Nutty, stinkin', (expletive) boulevard . . . ." In the next 
breath, though, Bernhard performed a ballad from another Andrew Lloyd Webber 
hit, "Jesus Christ Superstar," with a fair amount of feeling. She and her 
five-piece band, complete with backup singer, played both original and 
well-known songs. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent interviews Bernhard has spoken of a need to open up emotionally in 
her art even as she becomes saner and more content in her personal life. 
Disappointingly, the evening was devoted more to music than stand-up. She 
obviously takes her singing seriously but still seems inhibited somehow; her 
persona uses stylish hostility to keep us far away from her true feelings. Like 
any gifted comedian, she's a better truth teller in her scathing mode than in 
her more sincere one.  
</P>
<P>
 Bernhard is brilliant at forced intimacy. In Martin Scorsese's film "King of 
Comedy," Bernhard sang, "You're gonna love me/Like nobody's loved me/Come rain 
or shine" to a celebrity hostage played by Jerry Lewis, who was bound to a 
chair under a hill of thick tape. Here, threat hangs in the air when she tells 
the audience, "I feel sad and I want to share with you."  
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to know how to feel, though, when she mourns a list of friends who 
have died of AIDS in the same soft, insinuating voice that she has used to 
skewer show-biz insincerity. The audience sometimes seemed unsure which Sandra 
to respond to.  
</P>

 Easier to recognize, and funnier, is the nice Jewish girl from Michigan gone 
raunchy, reading aloud from X-rated phone sex ads. She also sings "50 Ways to 
Leave Your Lover" with female names ("Just get off the phone, Joan") and 
struts, in her encore, like Aero-smith's Steven Tyler, only in a red Lycra 
micro-mini. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, "Bad Behavior," which is scheduled to come to Los Angeles in 
the fall, is a snapshot of an unclassifiable performer in transition. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that fair enough for a work in progress? 
</P>
<P>
 * "Excuses for Bad Behavior, Part I" plays tonight at the La Jolla Playhouse, 
Mandell Weiss Theatre, 7:30 p.m., $34, (619) 550-1070.

BAGWELL, ASTROS BAG THE DODGERS; BASEBALL: HE HITS THREE HOME RUNS -- TWO IN 
THE NINE-RUN SIXTH -- AS HOUSTON ROLLS, 16-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He has been one of the most underrated players in the game, overlooked mostly 
because there are others in the league who play first base with more power, 
more personality and in a better TV market. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Friday night, after Jeff Bagwell had hit his third homer in the Dodgers' 
16-4 loss at the Astrodome, he didn't smile until he got back to the Houston 
Astro dugout and received the congratulations of his teammates and of the 
34,550 who cheered him out for a curtain call.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's my biggest night ever," said Bagwell, who was four for five, drove in 
six runs and leads the league with 74 runs batted in. "I mean, I hit three home 
runs in college, but what's that, against the University of Richmond? This is 
the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell, 26, hit home runs against three Dodgers, including two homers in the 
Astros' nine-run sixth inning -- making him only the 28th player in major 
league history to get two in an inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the Dodger clubhouse, catcher Mike Piazza was getting treatment on his 
left arch when the Astros erupted in the sixth. Piazza suffered a sprain as he 
landed on first base while beating out a grounder in the third inning. His 
status was listed as day to day. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have got to give them the credit, they are a good offensive club and are 
tough at home," said Piazza, who is second in the league to Bagwell with 65 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never played them well here since I have been here, though that's not 
an excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, who have won only three of their last 16 games here, have more to 
worry about than that. The loss dropped them to 36-36, the first time they 
haven't been above .500 since May 11, when they were 17-17 after completing a 
three-game sweep of Houston at Dodger Stadium. They had a better record after 
72 games last season, 37-35, but were tied for third in the National League 
West.  
</P>
<P>
 That three-game sweep of the Astros sent them on a seven-game winning streak, 
during which they took sole possession of first place. But after an 11-2 
stretch, during which the bullpen began to falter, the Dodgers have gone 11-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Against four Dodger pitchers Friday night, the Astros scored 16 runs, the 
first time the Dodgers have given up that many since 1987.  
</P>
<P>
 The Astros turned a 3-1, sixth-inning lead into a 12-1 cushion -- the first 
time since Aug. 21, 1990, against the Philadelphia Phillies, that the Dodgers 
have given up nine runs in an inning. With Ramon Martinez (6-4) on the mound, 
Bagwell hit a towering one-out home run to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 A walk, two hits and a run later, Roger McDowell took over and gave up four 
more runs. Rudy Seanez replaced McDowell and gave up Bagwell's second home run 
of the inning, a three-run drive into the Astros' bullpen in right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger left-hander Brian Barnes gave up four more runs over the next 1 2/3 
innings, including Bagwell's third homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they are hot like that, it doesn't matter what you throw, they hit," 
Martinez said. Chris Gwynn and Raul Mondesi hit back-to-back homers in the 
eighth inning to close the Dodger scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Bagwell, the 1991 National League rookie of the year who is batting 
.357 with a career-high 23 homers, humbly answered questions about his big 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I did right or what I did wrong, I just swung the bat and 
it had the right trajectory, I guess," Bagwell said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell has improved each season, batting .320 in 1993 with 20 homers and 88 
RBIs. He doesn't like talking about himself. But Eric Karros doesn't mind 
talking about him at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wrap up the MVP trophy right now and give it to him," Karros said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best right-handed hitter in the National League, and I can say the 
best all-around hitter. He's a guy who you like to see do well, but not against 
your own team, because you know that he can swing and beat you."

ANGELS FORGET TO COVER HOME; BASEBALL: LAPSE PROVES COSTLY TO FINLEY, AS 
RANGERS SCORE 2-1 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a bizarre phenomenon, one that the Angels don't try to explain, or even 
dare to discuss publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unpredictable. The only thing they really know about the occurrence is 
that it seems to arrive every five days. 
</P>
<P>
 More specifically, on the days that Chuck Finley pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again Friday night, Finley found himself victimized by a defensive 
blunder, turning a magnificent performance into a 2-1 loss to the Texas Rangers 
before 35,479 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley (5-7) realizes that he should be used to this by now. He realizes 20 
unearned runs were scored last season during his starts, and more unearned runs 
have occurred during his starts this season than any other pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there he stood on the mound in the fifth inning Friday, staring at the 
heavens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (31-43), losers for the fourth time in the last five games, and 17 
of their last 25, dropped to 3 1/2 games behind the first-place Rangers, 
primarily because of one mental lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had it all happen to me this year," said Finley, who pitched a 
six-hitter, striking out 10, including the first five batters. "A guy steals 
home on me (in Boston). And now this. My crisis tends to be around home plate 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 This one occurred in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Manny Lee hit a one-out single to center. Center fielder Rusty Greer followed 
with a single to left, and Lee stopped at second. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris James, the No. 9 hitter, swung away, only for the ball to dribble off 
the end of his bat. It trickled up the third base line. Catcher Chris Turner 
pounced on it, and off-balance, threw James out by a step. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a marvelous play, one that the Angels surely would be talking about 
afterward, but there was one problem. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Angels were admiring the play, Ranger third base coach Dave Oliver 
alertly realized that no one was covering home. He sent Lee home. By the time 
the Angels noticed, it was too late. First baseman J.T. Snow threw the ball to 
Finley, but all he could do was hope Lee fell while running home. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer, meanwhile, ran all the way to third. Finley walked back to the mound 
fuming. Third baseman Spike Owen tried to comfort Finley, but it was of little 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just stood there," Finley said, "watching to see if he was out. We were 
both at the line just watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "You like to think that wouldn't make or break the game, but unfortunately it 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Frye, activated from the disabled list earlier in the day, capitalized on 
the mistake, slapping a single to right, scoring Greer for a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a little confusion," Angel Mangel Marcel Lachemann said, "but 
that's not what cost us the game. We didn't execute some things, some 
fundamental things. That's what cost us. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job as manager is to make sure we do the fundamental things. If we don't 
do that, then it's my responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger starter Kenny Rogers (9-4), who has lost only one game since May 7, 
made sure the Angels' flaws became glaring. He pitched a six-hitter, yielding 
only three hits after the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers' most difficult task was surviving the play of his shortstop. Lee 
committed two errors in the first five innings and left the game with a pulled 
right rib-cage muscle. Esteban Beltre came in, and to make sure he didn't 
destroy the continuity, kicked the first ball he touched in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels considered the loss critical, particularly considering it was 
against the Rangers. Certainly, if this were just another game, Chili Davis 
wouldn't have been roaming the outfield for only the second time in two years. 
Lachemann, desperately wanting Bo Jackson's bat in the lineup, gambled by 
putting Davis in left field. 
</P>
<P>
 That strategy worked. There was only one fly ball hit to Davis, and Jackson 
went two for four, raising his career average to .429 off Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 It, of course, was spoiled by the fifth-inning blunder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just to go out and start playing solid baseball," Finley said. "We 
can't sit here and think there'll be a strike in two weeks, three weeks or four 
weeks. We've got to start playing the game right, right now, or it won't 
matter."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; BRAZIL MOVING FORWARD; GROUP B: CAMEROON 
IS UNCHARACTERISTICALLY DEFENSIVE, AND IT DOESN'T PAY OFF IN 3-0 SETBACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As France's coach, Henri Michel masterminded two monumental victories over 
Brazil, one in the championship game of the 1984 Summer Olympics and the other 
in the quarterfinals of the 1986 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had been able to do as much for Cameroon on Friday before 83,401 at 
Stanford Stadium, he no doubt would be considered a rival to the United States' 
Bora Milutinovic for most-valuable-coach honors in the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But what could he do? That was the question Michel asked after the 3-0 loss, 
explaining that it is his job to coach, and it is the players' job to play, 
and, if they do not play as he coaches them, it is hardly his fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't intend to play that way, but we did," he said of his team's 
uncharacteristic conservatism. "Out of fear, we pulled back." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Cameroon's players objected to his analysis, claiming that he had 
instructed them to observe safety first, which, as everyone who has seen them 
play in the last two World Cups knows, is a crime against the Indomitable 
Lions' nature. 
</P>
<P>
 But what could they do? If anyone knows how to beat Brazil, they said, it is 
Michel. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no one can beat the Brazilians in this World Cup. They have won their 
first two games, given their fans reason to samba with stylish plays featuring 
the exquisite Romario and Bebeto, allowed their coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira, 
to sleep at night by not giving up a goal, and made the experts who predicted 
they would win the tournament look like, well, experts. 
</P>
<P>
 So if there was confusion among the Lions about how to engage Brazil, it is no 
wonder, because they have spent so much of their time since arriving in the 
United States concentrating on matters having nothing to do with soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest episode, Cameroon's soccer federation officials told Michel 
before the game to bench outspoken goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell. But Michel, 
who has been with the team only since April, left the decision up to the 
players. When they backed Bell, he sent the 40-year-old goalkeeper onto the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Bell who had revealed Wednesday that he and his teammates were 
considering a strike if they were not paid as they had been promised by the 
federation. They decided against that, but a cynic might suggest that, based on 
their tactics against Brazil, they were trying to prevent either team from 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of negative approach was expected from Russia, which finally broke 
down in a 2-0 loss to Brazil here Monday, but not from Cameroon, which was so 
marvelous to watch in 1990 that international soccer federation officials 
invented an award to give to the most entertaining team in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions looked like a contender in a 2-2 tie Sunday against Sweden, but not 
Friday. Cameroon shadowed Romario with defender Raymond Kala, assigned two men 
to Bebeto, depending on which side of the field he was on, and situated so many 
players in the midfield it looked like the Ventura Freeway at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Brazilians managed to create some space for themselves, the Lions' 
reverted to their defensive tricks of 1990, committing fouls. The referee, 
Mexico's Arturo Brizio Carter, called 16 of them against the Lions, which they 
speculated later was the result of an international conspiracy against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The referee was a zero," Cameroon defender Stephen Tataw said. 
</P>
<P>
 With an overwhelmingly pro-Brazil crowd cheering them on, the favorites 
finally began to find a path through -- or over -- the Cameroon midfield with 
long passes for the quick Bebeto and Romario to chase. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 39th minute, one of them off the foot of midfielder Dunga found Romario 
behind two defenders. One on one, Bell had no chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira found more room for his forwards in the second half by separating 
them, sending Bebeto to the right flank. On one of his runs down that sideline 
in the 62nd minute, he was driven out of bounds by an unnecessarily hard, 
studs-up tackle by Rigobert Song Bahanag, who was banished from the game with a 
red card. 
</P>
<P>
 Rattled to find themselves playing one man short, the Lions went down, 2-0, 
one minute later when Jorginho's pass into the box connected with Marcio 
Santos, who headed the ball past Bell. Brazil added another goal in the 72nd 
minute, when Bell saved a shot by Romario but failed to smother the ball, 
allowing Bebeto to put it past him. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Cameroon's threats, there were none. Michel added some spice to the 
attack with the insertion in the 65th minute of forward Roger Milla, who, at 
42, became the oldest player in World Cup history.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Lions' goal-scoring star of 1990 had little opportunity in this game, 
managing only two meek shots that Brazil goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel fielded 
easily.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; MEXICO GETS OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT IN 
SECOND GAME; GROUP E: GARCIA SCORES TWICE AND TEAM HOLDS OFF IRELAND, 2-1. 
DIVISION IS A VIRTUAL FOUR-WAY TIE.

<P>
 His players' legs were heavier than lead, their gasps for air frantic, and 
Mexico Coach Miguel Mejia Baron was worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland had just scored, cutting Mexico's lead to 2-1 with six minutes to play 
and sending a jolt of enthusiasm through the Irish faithful at the Florida 
Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron was facing calamity. To have played two World Cup games and not to have 
won either? Unthinkable. Unpardonable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many things that cross your mind in that situation," Baron said. 
"Strange things happen in your head." 
</P>
<P>
 Strange things almost happened on the field too. But Mexican goalkeeper Jorge 
Campos managed to stretch his full length to grab a curving shot by Andy 
Townsend in the 90th minute, preserving Mexico's triumph and leaving the four 
teams in Group E tied with three points each. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to John Aldridge's goal, in the 84th minute, Ireland emerged from 
the defeat with a share of the group lead. If teams are even in points, the 
first tiebreaker is goal differential. Since all four have given up as many as 
they've scored, the next tiebreaker is goals scored. Mexico and Ireland have 
each scored two, Italy and Norway one each. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get those in training every day. It comes natural," Aldridge said of his 
header, which was set up by a pass from Jason McAteer deep on the right side. 
"I guess it can be a big goal now." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest goals of the day, though, were scored by Luis Garcia, who was 
moved from center-forward to the right side to revitalize Mexico's offense 
after its 1-0 loss to Norway on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia capitalized on the Irish players' fatigue toward the end of the first 
half, taking a short back-pass from Carlos Hermosillo and blasting a rolling 
shot past goalkeeper Pat Bonner and inside the left post in the 44th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the 66th minute, with the Irish pressing for a tie, Garcia took a 
short pass from Alberto Garcia Aspe -- who neatly dodged defender Denis Irwin 
-- and powered a right-footed shot past Bonner from outside the 18-yard box. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron wouldn't discuss Garcia's individual effort, preferring to praise his 
team's collective rebound from its opening defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very happy with my team," he said. "We played with an extraordinary 
spirit and we took our opportunities well. It was something very wonderful for 
me and for Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one lives through these moments in life, one learns more about life. My 
team played with great humility, worked very hard at their game and also had 
some luck." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish players and Coach Jack Charlton felt it was their bad luck to play 
in Orlando, where they and the sellout crowd of 61,219 roasted in the intense 
heat and cloying humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're sweating the whole day if you're doing nothing, so imagine what it's 
like out there when you're playing," McAteer said. "It really takes a lot out 
of the lads. The lads were saying it was much warmer than it was in New Jersey 
(site of their first game)." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Charlton: "(The Mexicans) played very well. They closed it down very 
quickly, which is remarkable in this heat. It was very much the way we play in 
Europe. Unfortunately, we weren't playing in Europe today. We were playing in 
100-degree temperature in the southern part of America. And it wasn't easy for 
us. But we accept that we lost the game. We'll play the next time in winter and 
see how it works out." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican reporters took that as a slight against the Mexican team, which 
Charlton said he hadn't intended. He said he felt the conditions were one 
reason for Ireland's loss, but not the sole reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very good team beat us, but they had to be a very good team to beat us," he 
said at a postgame news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he had been overheard telling an Irish TV crew before he left the 
field, "The Mexicans didn't beat us. The weather beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, Mexico dominated the game. Charlton, playing not to lose, 
deployed only one forward and stacked the midfield with five players. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy didn't hurt until the waning minutes of the first half, when the 
heat left the Irish too tired to play their usual energetic running game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heat like that burns your buns," Irish defender Terry Phelan said. "There's 
no way we could get up and down the (field)." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Townsend: "The sun was relentless. I think even their guys, in the last 
10 to 15 minutes, were affected by the heat. But I think we finished the 
stronger team." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mexico finished as the winning team because of Garcia, who has honed his 
skills playing for Atletico Madrid in the Spanish League. He wasn't a factor in 
Mexico's opener but posed a near-constant threat Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a faster game; we played more in the air," Garcia said. "We 
controlled the ball more." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hermosillo: "We are in excellent position to advance into the second 
round. We must play Italy with the same passion and intensity. If we play with 
a team concept, we will win." 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland plays Norway in its final game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran ourselves into the ground today to try and get something from the game 
and we came very close," Charlton said. "But it is not the end of the world. 
There will be no recriminations from me about the game. We lost the game, fine. 
I always had a feeling this would be the game which would cost us."

 Like father, like son. Like senior, like junior. Same name, same score, same 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stockton fired his second consecutive 66 Friday to open a three-stroke 
lead midway through the Senior Players Championship at the TPC of Michigan in 
Dearborn. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Dave Stockton Jr., a rookie on the PGA Tour, had his second 
consecutive 66 and led the field by a stroke in the Greater Hartford Open in 
Cromwell, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called Junior this morning and some of the TV guys told me how he was 
doing," senior Stockton said. "But I couldn't think about him while I was 
playing, not on this course." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton, at 12-under-par 132 for the tournament, is followed by Lee Trevino, 
who shot a 69 for a 135. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton has shot eight consecutive sub-70 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Stockton has an eight-under 132 after two rounds. David Frost shot 
a 68 for a 133 and sole possession of second place in the Hartford tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stocktons could become the only father-son duo to win PGA tournaments in 
the same week and also the first to win the same tournament. The senior 
Stockton won the Greater Hartford Open in 1976.

 Joanne Dibble, wife of Cincinnati Red pitcher Rob Dibble, told Paul Daugherty 
of the Cincinnati Enquirer what her life has been like while her husband is on 
the disabled list: 
</P>
<P>
 "He almost blew up the house trying to light the grill. He couldn't get it 
started, so he came in and got a box of matches. He lit the thing. Of course, 
it exploded. He burned all the hair off his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a slob. A total slob. He doesn't know we have a place for the dirty 
clothes. He just figures they go on the floor next to the bed. Miraculously, 
they get clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Dibble: "He eats between 3 and 5 in the morning. When I get up, I see the 
line of stuff from the refrigerator to the living room. It's like a little 
trail." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was the last Angel to lead the American League in home runs? 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey's baggage: Bernie Lincicome in the Chicago Tribune: "When Ken Griffey 
Jr. breaks Roger Maris' single-season home run record, he should get three 
asterisks: one for batting indoors, one for hitting a juiced baseball and one 
for inheriting superior genes."

 The Chamberlain file: Alex Hannum, commenting on Wilt Chamberlain in Terry 
Pluto's book, "Tall Tales": 
</P>
<P>
 "When I coached the San Francisco Warriors, I thought Al Attles was the 
fastest guy on our team -- by far. We used to gamble a lot -- which player 
could jump the highest and run the fastest. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I set up a series of races, baseline to baseline. In the finals, It was 
Wilt and Attles and Wilt just blew past him. I'm convinced that Wilt 
Chamberlain is one of the greatest all-around athletes the world has ever 
seen."

WIMBLEDON / WOMEN'S DRAW; DAVENPORT COMING OF AGE WITH MOMENTUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given the choice of becoming Jennifer Capriati, the Sequel, or simply Lindsay 
Davenport, the mostly normal kid from Murrieta Valley High, Davenport decided 
you can't put a price tag on teen-age innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 So she stayed in school, turned pro -- but unlike Capriati, picked her spots 
-- went to the prom, went to graduation ceremonies and then went to Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 Now an official full-time member of the working force, the ninth-seeded 
Davenport went someplace else Friday -- to the fourth round, courtesy of her 
6-4, 3-6, 6-1, victory over Germany's Barbara Rittner. One more victory and 
Davenport reaches her second Grand Slam event quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Her march through the women's draw hasn't gone unnoticed. Pam Shriver, who has 
played at Wimbledon every year since 1978 and advanced to the semifinals three 
times, still likes Martina Navratilova and Conchita Martinez to meet for the 
title. But. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It may still be a bit early for her, but she's dangerous," Shriver said of 
Davenport. "She's dangerous . . . she returns serve so well. On grass, someone 
who can dictate play with the heavy-duty groundstrokes off both sides is a real 
force." 
</P>
<P>
 In only her second Wimbledon, Davenport, 18, has found herself among the 
favorites to do more damage. With top-seeded Steffi Graf back home in the 
Rhineland, the women's singles is no longer an exercise in futility. Any of the 
remaining seeded players, among them Davenport, can win the right to raise the 
silver salver overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport was originally in the lower part of the draw, with No. 4 
Navratilova, No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, No. 5 Jana Novotna and No. 13 Zina 
Garrison-Jackson, among others. But then Mary Pierce withdrew and Davenport was 
moved to the other bracket, where five-time champion Graf resided. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happens? Graf loses, leaving the 6-foot-2, 165-pound Davenport with a 
significantly easier path. She now faces No. 10 Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, 
a 6-4, 6-1 winner over American Meredith McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory Monday against Sabatini is no sure thing. Three years ago, Sabatini 
served for the championship here twice, but lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would probably rather play Sabatini, just because I'd be the underdog and 
it would be a great match to win," Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, Davenport doesn't seem to be in a hurry to reach stardom, at 
least not the kind that prompted Capriati, three months her senior, to forfeit 
her youth. Capriati, who turned pro a week before her 14th birthday, turned 
herself in to drug rehab before her 19th. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson wasn't lost on Davenport, who spent a year on the tour as an 
amateur before deciding to turn pro in February of 1993. She remains forever 
grateful for the wait and forever sorry for Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Capriati's arrest) is unfortunate, because I don't think she really 
was able to have anything normal, like friends, or shopping, or even going to 
the movies, and that was something I definitely got to experience," said 
Davenport, the first American woman to crack the top 10 rankings -- she's No. 9 
-- since Capriati in October of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Davenport, "I really feel -- and my sisters and my whole family feel -- I 
had very normal teen-age and high school years when I was at home. It's 
something I would never trade back. It was probably some of the best times so 
far in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Like everyone in tennis, Davenport followed Capriati's career closely. One of 
her lasting memories is of watching Capriati, only 15 when she became the 
youngest semifinalist in U.S. Open history, play Monica Seles at Flushing 
Meadow in 1991. Now she roots for Capriati again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody wants her to come back," Davenport said. "I know I do." 
</P>
<P>
 If it were up to Davenport, there would be no more Capriati-type stories. 
That's because there would be no more touring pros barely old enough to 
baby-sit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think girls need to be out there at 14 and even 15," she said. 
"There's no way they can handle everything on their own. And this is a job and 
you shouldn't have 20 people helping you with it." 
</P>
<P>
 And if she does happen to lose to Sabatini, don't be surprised if Davenport 
visits a practice court late that night. Sometimes she will simply go out and 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fun of it. Something Capriati apparently never had the chance to 
understand. Women's Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other winners in the women's upper draw: third-seeded Conchita 
Martinez of Spain, who beat Nathalie Tauziat of France, 6-1, 6-3, and unseeded 
Larisa Neiland of Latvia, who defeated No. 6 Kimiko Date of Japan, 6-3, 6-2. . 
. . No. 14 Amanda Coetzer also advanced, beating Ginger Helgeson of Alpine, 
Calif., 6-0, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Shriver was eliminated from singles competition by Argentina's Florencia 
Labat, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. Shriver, who is still alive in the doubles competition, 
played recently at the Eastbourne tournament, where she exchanged 
unpleasantries with Australian Rachel McQuillan. Or as Shriver put it, "Just 
generally down-in-the-trenches bitching." Shriver was upset at McQuillan for 
sitting in Shriver's assigned sideline chair. Something of a cat fight ensued, 
and McQuillan later told Shriver, "You're old, you're haggard and you should 
retire." Shriver happily reminded McQuillan of her failings as Australia's next 
great player.

WIMBLEDON / MEN'S DRAW; AGASSI SHINES AGAIN, THIS TIME ON A CLOUDY DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Andre Agassi beat two opponents Friday, an early-evening shower and then Aaron 
Krickstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain began to fall gently during the third set of his match on Centre Court. 
Leading by two sets and ahead in the third, 6-5, Agassi didn't want an extended 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Krickstein, who won the 12th game, wasn't in a hurry. He led Agassi 
in the tiebreaker, 5-2, and seemed well on his way to another set and perhaps a 
comeback and upset. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for comebacks. Agassi won the next five tiebreaker points and the 
match, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how much I wanted to make that last (match-winning) 
backhand," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after his final shot, the clouds opened. Umpires and officials rushed 
for cover, fans headed for the exits and ground crew members frantically 
dragged a tarp over the grass court. 
</P>
<P>
 So hurried were the postmatch events that Agassi found himself looking for his 
seat, which was long gone, and his equipment bag. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't have to look far for his next opponent. It is sixth-seeded American 
Todd Martin, who defeated Martin Damm of the Czech Republic, 6-2, 6-7 (7-1), 
4-6, 6-3, 11-9, in a match that lasted four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 As did the 12th-seeded Agassi, Martin battled the elements. Before the clouds 
rolled in, the temperature was 92 degrees, sometimes higher on the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means you get a good suntan and get to drink lots of water afterward," 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also means he gets to face Agassi, no easy task, what with Agassi's 
legendary legion of British fans, who serenaded him Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the higher seeding, Martin didn't sound like a player who has been 
picked by some to reach the finals here against defending champion Pete 
Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a bit unfounded, I think," he said. "If I were to be making the odds, 
which I think I could, I certainly wouldn't have put myself at No. 2." 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi is beginning to like his chances. The courts, worn down by a week of 
action, are slower, more unpredictable and more agreeable to his baseline game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be playing him on the second week rather than the first week," he 
said. Men's Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Sampras' match against Chuck Adams was suspended because of rain with 
Sampras leading, 6-1, 5-1. Sampras still hasn't dropped a set through almost 
three rounds. . . . No. 10 Michael Chang advanced to the fourth round with a 
7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 6-2, victory over Grant Connell of Canada, as did No. 8 Sergi 
Bruguera, who beat Jean-Philippe Fleurian, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 2-6, 7-5.

 Fernando Valenzuela, who left the majors this season to pitch in Mexico, 
returned to the big leagues Friday when he signed with the Philadelphia 
Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, 33, who will report to the Phillies on Monday, will make his debut 
Tuesday against Florida and will go again next Sunday against the Dodgers, 
General Manager Lee Thomas said. The left-hander was 10-3 for the Jalisco 
Cowboys of the Mexican League. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela was 8-10 with a 4.94 earned-run average in 31 starts for Baltimore 
last season. He was 149-128 with a 3.45 ERA in a 13-year career that started in 
1981, when he won the Cy Young Award and rookie-of-the-year honors with the 
Dodgers. 
</P>

 Philadelphia has lost starters Curt Schilling, Tommy Greene and Ben Rivera to 
the disabled list. DODGERS

 Smith Knows Way Around a Cockpit 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't that long ago that batting coach Reggie Smith, then the Dodger 
right-fielder, was hanging upside down over the Marina in an open cockpit 
by-plane, practicing aerobatics. Smith, who along with teammates Don Sutton and 
Rick Monday, had a pilot's license, describes those days as his daredevil 
years. "I remember one time Sutton crash-landed at Van Nuys airport -- he 
forgot to put the landing gear down," Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith came one hour short of getting his aerobatics rating in 1978, but he 
acknowledges that if he were playing today, the club would forbid the activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dodgers knew I flew, but they didn't know about the aerobatics," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With an off-day in Houston Thursday, Smith had hoped to go to NASA and 
establish a contact or two to help fulfill another dream -- to fly a military 
jet. But bad weather prevented him.

 First baseman Eric Karros was a late scratch, but the cause is up for debate.

 "We think his shoulder is hurting, but he doesn't want to admit it," Manager 
Tom Lasorda said. "The trainers think there is something there. So we thought 
we would rest him."

 Karros said: "My shoulder is giving me no problems."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GOODEN BOMBARDED IN WORST LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took only 5 1/3 innings for Dwight Gooden to sink to an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how long it took the Pittsburgh Pirates, led by Dave Clark's two home 
runs and four runs batted in, to bomb the Met right-hander for nine runs Friday 
night en route to a 9-4 victory at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most runs given up by Gooden (3-4), an 11-year veteran, in a single 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny Neagle (7-8) got the win, the Pirates' sixth in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 10, Colorado 3 -- Matt Williams hit his National League-leading 
27th home run at Denver as the Giants broke a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco has won seven straight games at Mile High Stadium, dating to 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Colorado pitchers combined to strike out a club-record 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 3, San Diego 2 -- Reggie Sanders tied the score with a bases-loaded 
single in the eighth and scored the game-winner on Bret Boone's single in the 
10th at Cincinnati as the streaking Reds rallied for their sixth consecutive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Carrasco (4-3) pitched two perfect innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 9, Philadelphia 4 -- Tom Glavine, who had lost his last two starts, 
didn't care that he had allowed six hits and four earned runs in six innings at 
Philadelphia. All he wanted was to pitch well enough to give the Braves a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The key offensively was Mark Lemke's three-run homer that capped a five-run 
fourth inning for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the numbers don't show it," said Glavine (8-7), who was 22-6 last 
season, "but I'm narrowing down the things I have to work on." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Jackson (9-2) was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 9, Florida 0 -- Darrin Fletcher assumed his new role as Montreal's 
cleanup hitter with a flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher, batting fourth while Larry Walker sits out a four-game suspension, 
hit two homers and drove in five runs at Montreal to help send the Marlins to 
their fifth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The five RBIs match Fletcher's career high, set one month ago against Florida 
in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly a month, huh?" he said. "Put me in the lineup on July 24 and August 
24." 
</P>
<P>
 Butch Henry (4-0) and two relievers allowed six hits. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 3, Chicago 1 -- The bat of Mark Whiten and the arm of Allen Watson 
were the key elements of this victory at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson (5-3), the winning pitcher, has now permitted only four runs in 29 1/3 
innings over his last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiten drove in two runs with a third-inning single.

<P>
 Jim Deshaies turned a slight adjustment into a large advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Troubled all season by an inability to keep his pitches down in the strike 
zone, Deshaies (4-7) used a shortened windup and a different release point 
Friday night to limit the Kansas City Royals to one run and four hits in eight 
innings in a 4-1 victory for the Twins at Minneapolis. The victory, which ended 
Minnesota's three-game losing streak, was only Deshaies' second victory since 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Aguilera pitched the ninth for his 16th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Deshaies, who leads the major leagues in home runs allowed, gave up his 22nd 
of the season, to Vince Coleman in the third inning. But after a leadoff double 
in the fourth, Deshaies retired 15 of the final 16 batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 5, Toronto 1 -- Chris Sabo homered in the first inning at Toronto 
and broke a 1-1 tie in the ninth with a two-run double as the Orioles sent the 
Blue Jays to their sixth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Eichhorn (3-1) beat Dave Righetti (0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 4, Milwaukee 3 -- Damon Berryhill hit a two-out, two-run single in the 
ninth inning at Milwaukee to beat the Brewers' Mike Fetters (1-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Berryhill got the chance for the game-winning hit when Tom Brunansky, traded 
by the Brewers to Boston last week, reached second base in a rundown with two 
out in the ninth to put runners at second and third. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Harris (2-4) got credit for the victory by pitching a scoreless eighth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 4, Detroit 3 -- Although he couldn't finish, Steve Ontiveros got the 
Athletics off to a strong start with his third straight impressive performance. 
Ontiveros (4-2) allowed no runs in five innings at Oakland before leaving with 
a tight groin. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last three games, he has given up no runs and six hits and allowed only 
five runners as far as second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, Seattle 2 -- Frank Thomas and Robin Ventura hit solo homers and 
Scott Sanderson (6-2) got the victory at Seattle. Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. hit 
his 32nd home run.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; DAHLIN GIVES SWEDEN HEADY PERFORMANCE; 
GROUP B: STRIKER LEFT OFF 1990 CUP TEAM HEADS IN TWO GOALS IN 3-1 VICTORY OVER 
TUMULTUOUS RUSSIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Adding to its laundry list of 1994 World Cup nightmares, Russia now can be 
haunted by the elusive Martin Dahlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlin, the brilliant Swedish striker, kept popping his head into Russia's 
front door Friday night, scoring on two second-half headers and setting up 
another goal in Sweden's 3-1 victory before 71,528 at Pontiac Silverdome. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Sweden's first World Cup triumph in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlin, the first black member of the national team, is more than making up 
for a career slump that cost him a place on the 1990 World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was one of his best games, if not his best," Sweden Coach Tommy Svensson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Svensson can only hope the victory was enough to propel his team into the 
second round, because Sweden must face Brazil next Tuesday without Dahlin, who 
picked up his second yellow card of the tournament and must sit out the team's 
final Group B game. 
</P>
<P>
 Difficult to imagine Sweden challenging Brazil without Dahlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it's a loss," said forward Tomas Brolin, who tied the score on a 
first-half penalty kick. "But we have other players also. I think we are also 
in the second round." 
</P>
<P>
 Dhalin scored the decisive goal in the 60th minute. The game had turned in the 
49th minute when Russian forward Sergei Gorlukovitch received a red-card 
ejection for taking Dahlin down from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians, gasping to stay in the game at that point, could not endure 
having to play a man short. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden soon forced the issue when midfielder Jonas Thern, uncovered in the 
left corner, left-footed a pass that hooked into an oncoming Dahlin, who 
flicked a header to the right of goalkeeper Dmitri Kharine. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlin made it 3-1 in the 82nd minute, this time heading in an extraordinary 
crossing pass, right to left, from forward Kennet Andersson. As do many humble 
stars, Dahlin downplayed his role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got two great crosses from Thern and Andersson," Dahlin said. "For me, it 
was only with my head. It was not so difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians would beg to differ. "Nobody on our defense could handle Dahlin," 
Yuri Semin, a Russian assistant coach, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocked by dissension and turmoil, the Russians actually put a scare into 
Sweden, scoring the first goal in the fourth minute on Oleg Salenko's penalty 
kick. The score was set up when Sweden's Roger Ljung tripped Alexander 
Borodiuk, who appeared poised to score in front of the Swedish goal. 
</P>
<P>
 In a questionable strategy by Coach Pavel Sadyrin, Russia tried to sit on the 
lead, drawing whistles of derision from the crowd. In fact, in the 34th minute, 
Kharine received a yellow card for delaying play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadyrin, who has withstood mass defections and criticisms, also chose not to 
play Sergei Yuran, presumably one of Russia's top strikers. It might have been 
one of Sadyrin's last decisions involving the team; sources told the Associated 
Press on Friday that Sadyrin would resign as Russia's coach, or be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadyrin did not face the media afterward, but his assistant said Yuran did not 
play because he had played poorly against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian result seemed inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden tied the score, 1-1, in the 39th minute on Brolin's penalty kick, set 
up by -- who else? -- Dahlin. After taking a sideline pass, Andersson, his back 
to the goal near the right corner, bounced the ball off his knee and then 
kicked it back over his head toward the goal, where Gorlukovitch was backing 
into Dahlin, who had position on the Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 A penalty was called and Brolin easily drove his shot to the right of Kharine. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it was tough for a while, the Swedes said they never felt threatened. 
"I felt all the game we were the better team," Dahlin said. "It's not always 
good to score the first goal. We saw that against Cameroon." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians played their best defense in the locker room, complaining about 
the red-card ejection that changed the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it hurt us," Semin said. "I mean you're playing with only nine 
field players." 
</P>
<P>
 With one game left in Group B, Sweden trails Brazil by two points, six to 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Tuesday's showdown won't be the same without Dahlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it doesn't matter," he said. "I hope this enough to get into the 
second round."

CAN THEY REALLY FORGET ABOUT COLOMBIA?; GROUP A: AMERICANS VOW TO TAKE THEM ONE 
AT A TIME, WITH ROMANIA COMING UP SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One or another of the players on the U.S. World Cup team was saying how 
Romania's 4-1 loss to Switzerland last Wednesday was inevitable, coming as it 
did after an emotional victory over Colombia in their first game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's expected that a team would come out flat after that kind of game," is 
the gist of what many players said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using that logic, shouldn't the U.S. team also come out flat against Romania 
on Sunday? Won't it be similarly affected by its emotional victory over 
Colombia? 
</P>
<P>
 "No. Our mentality is different than the Romanians'," Marcelo Balboa said. 
"When they (fall behind), they start bickering. Our mentality is very good. 
We'll be focused." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. players are certainly talking the right talk to demonstrate that they 
aren't dwelling on the upset. They don't even want to talk about it anymore. 
Which in no way means they aren't asked about it every day after their morning 
practice at the Mission Viejo training center, when they meet on a patio with 
the ever-growing international media contingent showing an interest in the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily since Wednesday, the U.S. players have been asked by a still incredulous 
world press how it was that they beat a team that was seen as a possible winner 
of this World Cup tournament. Every day they try to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Colombia game is so over," Alexi Lalas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans' approach to Sunday's game will be an interesting test of that 
ability to focus, because rarely has the team been in a position to put a big 
victory behind it. After the 2-0 victory over England in last summer's U.S. 
Cup, the team played Germany and came away with a respectable 4-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent gauge was the team's final warm-up game, against Mexico on 
June 4. Only minutes after that 1-0 surprise victory, the players were talking 
about their first World Cup opponent. Their willingness to put the Mexico game 
behind them is a measure of a team's maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Thomas Dooley sees it, the team has met one goal and now is obligated 
to set new ones and move on. Dooley, whose life is a series of goals, said the 
team will have no trouble leaving the Colombia game behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not a problem," he said. "We have such unity. We have talked about our 
goals and what is our plan. It's important that everybody see the same way. 
It's easy to say, 'We want to get to the second round.' But we need a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We set our goal to get four points, and now we have four points a little 
early. Now we must set another goal and move on. We must get at least another 
point from the game against Romania. This will help us reach our higher goals." 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side to all this is Romania, which, Lalas notes, is likely to be 
"very ticked off." The Romanians have only three points in the group and, like 
the United States, want at least another point to ensure advancement to the 
second round. If they were flat against Switzerland, there's not much chance 
they will make the same mistake against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are an emotional team," U.S. assistant Sigi Schmid said. "That emotion 
brings them to great highs and that can also bring them down a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. players want to maintain an even keel, even as they sail into 
unfamiliar waters.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; GARCIA AT 
CENTER STAGE WHEN IT COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The inscription on the back of the Mexican fans' shirts said it all: "Confia 
en Mexico." Rely on Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans were confident that Mexico would not let them down a second time. The 
1-0 loss to Norway in the first game was but a memory, a defeat that could be 
blamed on World Cup nerves, perhaps, or even bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Mexico had held the more powerful Norwegians in check until the 
final minutes before yielding a goal. Even then, Coach Miguel Mejia Baron's 
team had fought back and almost gained a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland would be an equally difficult opponent, but the fans were sure that 
victory could be theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Over in the Irish camp, the feeling was that, having beaten Italy, the 
favorite to win the group title, Mexico could also be defeated, or at least 
tied. That would give Ireland four points and virtually assure passage to the 
next round. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the heat and humidity would be a factor, but surely it could be no worse 
at the Florida Citrus Bowl than it had been at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. 
Ireland approached the game, therefore, in an equally confident manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico made a couple of surprise changes in its lineup, relegating forward 
Hugo Sanchez and defender Ramon Ramirez to the bench and bringing in Carlos 
Hermosillo as the central striker, flanked by Luis Roberto Alves on the left 
and Luis Garcia on the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia had seemed out of place playing wide against Norway, his usual position 
or role being central striker. The same thing was true Friday, but Garcia 
solved the problem by abandoning his role on the right and drifting more and 
more toward the center of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was two goals by the Atletico Madrid star and a 2-1 victory for 
Mexico, which meant there was no way Baron could blame Garcia afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Mexican goals resulted from short passes in or near the penalty area to a 
wide-open Garcia, who had managed to elude the Irish defense simply by not 
being where he was supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than criticize Baron for playing him on the right, Garcia was 
diplomatic when asked about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did like my new position," he said. "I felt good about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not feeling so good was Ireland's coach, Jack Charlton, whose behavior at the 
postgame news conference was matched only by the foul language he and his 
players were guilty of on the bench. Soccer is not for choirboys, true, but 
there are limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "You write what you like," Charlton fumed at reporters. "You always do 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Ireland lose? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is simple: It was beaten by a better team; a team that could pace 
itself to last 90 minutes without wilting in the closing stages; a team that 
let the ball do the work, making the pass a more effective weapon than the run; 
a team that had some creative ideas and put them to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignacio Ambriz played a captain's role for Mexico, setting the example on both 
offense and defense, while Hermosillo and especially Alberto Garcia Aspe were 
constant thorns in the side of the Irish.  
</P>
<P>
 Ireland played with heart and deserved the late goal that John Aldridge scored 
on a crossing pass from his fellow substitute, Jason McAteer. 
</P>
<P>
 They might even have got the tying goal had Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos, 
wearing his usual circus outfit, not been there to save Andy Townsend's 
wickedly curving shot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the result was a fair one and it leaves the group wide open. Each of the 
four teams has three points from two games. Tuesday will be decision day when 
Ireland and Norway meet at Giants Stadium in a game that has 0-0 written all 
over it, while Italy and Mexico play in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters for the Irish, however, is that defenders Terry Phelan 
and Denis Irwin both received their second yellow cards of the tournament, 
meaning they will have to sit out Tuesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexicans had a mathematical edge until Aldridge's goal left the teams 
deadlocked at the top of the standings -- in goals scored. Similarly, the 
Italians and Norwegians are tied just behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 Which teams go through and which go home seemingly will not be determined 
until the final kick. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's Luis Garcia who takes it, put your money on Mexico. ATHLETICS

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; COMMENTARY; CAMEROON DOESN'T HAVE IT IN 
THE BAG 
</P>

 Hooligan activity is reported to be down in this World Cup, unless you count 
what goes on behind closed doors at Cameroon team headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 In Indomitable Lion news Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- After much debate, team members consented to play Brazil despite a no-show 
by the much-anticipated "man with a suitcase," who was to deliver $400,000 -- 
presumably in crisp, unmarked bills -- to Palo Alto to ward off a threatened 
Lion wildcat strike. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Cameroon soccer federation ordered Coach Henri Michel to bench 
outspoken goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell, the Cameroonian version of a player 
representative and alleged ringleader of the boycotters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In a heated team meeting, players demanded Bell be kept in the lineup. As 
the minutes wound down before lineup cards were due, Michel accedes to his 
players' wishes, defying the federation edict and risking his future 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Players decided to dedicate the game to Michel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bell said, "The politicians are trying to keep me down. They think I want 
to be a politician. They want to kill me in the crib." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Team captain Stephen Tataw blasted referee Arturo Brizio Carter of Mexico 
for behaving "as if he wasn't conscious in what he was doing" and for 
"break(ing) down the morale of the Cameroon team." After an impassioned 
minute-long speech before the international press, Tataw concluded: "I think it 
is not nice." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Picking up on the same theme, Bell accused FIFA of rigging the World Cup, 
asserting that "FIFA wants to have Brazil go to the final." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roger Milla, the Pele of Cameroon, was asked by a U.S. journalist to 
comment on the "financial distractions" facing his team and exploded into an 
expletive-ridden tirade that the French interpreter, a blushing middle-aged 
woman, initially refused to translated. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After much prodding, the interpreter informed the U.S. journalist that 
Milla has told him to "quit busting my (chops)" and his virility has just been 
assailed by the most famous athlete in Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another player, agreeing to speak only under the condition of anonymity, 
said that because of what happened to Bell, "the players are frightened to talk 
about (the salary dispute) anymore. We don't have any problems with the team. 
All the problems are outside the team." As he spoke, the player flipped his 
identification tag over, shielding his name from the press. 
</P>
<P>
 (Sidenote: Cameroon loses soccer game to Brazil, 3-0.) 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a fun bunch of guys or what? 
</P>
<P>
 The Indomitable In-Disarray Lions remain the World Cup leaders in airing their 
dirty laundry in public, probably because they can't afford the dry cleaning. 
Nothing ever happens to them in private. Whatever they do, they do in full 
world view. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Well, for one, it's a lot cheaper than Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Cameroon would threaten to kidnap a World Cup game and hold it for 
ransom. Claiming they haven't been paid for two months, the Lions demanded 
payment up front this week before agreeing to suit up against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 After Cameroon's sports minister, Bernard Massoua, turned up at the team's 
training camp in Moraga on Wednesday with a suitcase carrying $535,000, the 
Lions shook their heads and said, "Not enough." This prompted the president of 
the country, Paul Biya, to intervene. Biya guaranteed the players an additional 
$400,000 in exchange for their promise to provide Brazil with an opponent at 
Stanford Stadium on Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions played, got pounded and later complained that the man did not 
deliver the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, we have not gotten paid," defender Samuel Ekeme Ndiba said. "A big 
transaction must take place. Maybe tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the dispute rests in the sorry state of the Cameroon franc. The Lions 
were paid the same amount for qualifying for the World Cup in 1994 as they were 
in 1990, but the country's franc today is worth only half as much as it was 
four years ago. Thus, the players contend they are entitled to twice as much 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel, who didn't get to be a World Cup coach without a certain degree of 
savvy, has a contract that pays him in Swiss francs. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bell, this territory is familiar. In the 1990 World Cup, federation 
officials ordered Bell benched after he demanded more money for the players and 
the coach of that team, Valery Nepomnyachy, carried out the command. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident earned Bell the nickname of "Mandela" among his teammates for 
being a man unjustly exiled for fighting the good fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon, still winless after two games in Group B, must defeat Russia next 
Tuesday if it is to advance to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Bell be on the field for that one? 
</P>
<P>
 Will any Indomitable Lions be on the field for that one? 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup waits and watches as one very ticked-off crew of soccer players 
from a small country in Africa continues to give new meaning to the phrase 
"living out of a suitcase."

HOT TIME IN THE CITY; MEXICO'S VICTORY OVER IRELAND SPARKS WILD CELEBRATIONS, 
DISTURBANCES IN THE CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of horn-blowing soccer fans carrying Mexican flags and 
shouting "Mex-i-CO, Mex-i-CO" gathered at the Independence Monument to 
celebrate their country's first 1994 World Cup victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The final whistle had barely sounded in the 2-1 triumph over Ireland when 
Mexicans began pouring onto fashionable Paseo de la Reforma, many abandoning 
their offices for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing, 1-0, to Norway on Sunday, the Mexican team desperately needed to 
earn points against Ireland to avoid being eliminated in the first round. 
Mexico can assure itself of a berth in the second round with a victory over 
Italy on Thursday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the celebrants broke the windshields of autos parked on nearby streets 
and trampled a tent city that housed protesters from southern Mexico. The 
Associated Press said 36 people were injured, including 20 riot police. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio announcers were advising listeners not to join the throngs, as riot 
police fought fans for control of the area around the monument, a pillar with a 
golden angel on top that has become the capital's symbol. Several people were 
arrested in the scuffle.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials quickly withdrew the riot-control units and sealed off the 
street for several blocks. A mariachi band was installed on a mobile stage in 
front of the monument. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-afternoon, fans were swaying to the band's waltz-like rhythm and 
singing, "Mexico, lovely and beloved; Mexico, I am for you." Couples and a few 
drunken men danced where they could find space. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a seasonal afternoon shower, crowds kept coming well into the evening. 
Vendors did a booming business in flags and plastic horns that fans tooted in a 
three-syllable rhythm, echoing the honking of horns from cars and trucks packed 
with passengers cruising the access streets. 
</P>
<P>
 For a peso, the equivalent of about 30 cents, Guadalupe Ruiz painted "Mexico" 
in white italics across 18-year-old Juan Ignacio Bustamante's cheeks. Then she 
smudged a spot of red paint above it and green below, completing the colors of 
the Mexican flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Gonzalez, 15, said he was enjoying the celebration, whether Mexico 
qualifies for the second round. "I think we have a good chance of tying," he 
added. "Italy is not that good this year." 
</P>
<P>
 His 19-year-old cousin, Mariana Gonzalez, a student, added, "The truth is, 
Mexicans will celebrate anything. Just wait till you see what happens if we 
qualify."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; TODAY'S GAMES AT A GLANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GROUP F 
</P>
<P>
 at Florida Citrus Bowl, Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgium vs. Netherlands 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 9:30 a.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ABC, Univision. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Belgian Coach Paul Van Himst will use three forwards instead 
of two, guaranteeing a defensive mind-set.It's the only way he believes his 
team can play in hot, humid weather, which continues to drain energy and 
dictates a slower pace. Josip Weber, Belgium's scoring threat, did little last 
Sunday against Morocco. He and Marc Degryse, who scored Belgium's only goal, 
will be the forwards today. Dutch Coach Dick Advocaat's team is 
offense-oriented. Advocaat probably will make one change, starting forward 
Gaston Taument in place of Marc Overmars. Taument scored the game-winner in 
Holland's 2-1 decision over Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Belgium will be a slave to defense, taking few chances and waiting 
for counterattacks. Holland will attack, but this game won't be an offensive 
display because neither team is accustomed to this weather. Look for the Dutch 
to use their speed on the wings and try to get the ball to Dennis Bergkamp.  
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Because both won their first games, neither team is in a must-win 
situation. However, neither particularly wants to win the group title, because 
that would mean a game against the second-place finisher in tough Group E in 
Orlando. Second place brings an easier foe, the runner-up in Group B. That will 
probably be Cameroon, Sweden or Russia. Look for a 1-1 tie. HELENE ELLIOTT

 GROUP F 
</P>
<P>
 at Giants Stadium, E. Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Morocco vs. Saudi Arabia 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 9:30 a.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: In what could be an offensive showdown between teams with 
little to lose, the most interesting duel matches Moroccan forward Mohamed 
Chaouch and Saudi goalkeeper Muhammad Al Deayea.Chaouch hit the crossbar twice 
in Morocco's 1-0 loss to Belgium in the opener. Al Deayea was splendid in goal 
for the first 86 minutes of the Saudis' first-round game against the 
Netherlands. But then he sprinted 10 yards out and attempted to intercept a 
Dutch header. He missed the ball, and Taument headed it into an open net to 
give the Netherlands a 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: The winner of this game between 0-1 teams will have a chance to 
advance to the second round. If they tie, both probably are finished. By not 
trailing the powerful Dutch until the final minutes, the Saudis feel they 
gained the international respect they were seeking at their first World Cup. 
The Moroccans, however, are not satisfied. After outplaying the Belgians before 
losing, they are convinced they are good enough to keep playing. They feel 
victory here is essential and undoubtedly will perform like it. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: The Saudis will win the affection of the crowd, as they did in 
Washington, with their unusual politeness. This will not disguise, however, the 
fact that they are sorely overmatched and will get hammered. Morocco by at 
least two. BILL PLASCHKE

 GROUP D 
</P>
<P>
 at Foxboro Stadium, Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina vs. Nigeria 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ABC, Univision. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: One of the more intriguing pairings in Round 1, pitting 
venerable World Cup warriors against an emerging soccer nation.Argentina has 
won two World Cups and reached the final on two other occasions, most recently 
four years ago. This is Nigeria's first World Cup. For openers, Argentina 
crushed Greece, 4-0, and the Super Eagles handled Bulgaria with ease, 3-0. It 
will be interesting to see how the Nigerians defend the Argentine stars, 
notably Diego Maradona, Claudio Caniggia and Gabriel Batistuta. Batistuta 
scored three times against Greece, Maradona once. Nigeria has an excellent 
defender in Uche Okechukwu, who took Bulgarian star Hristo Stoichkov out of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: In one game, Argentina has done much to repair its image as a World 
Cup dinosaur in need of an overhaul. In one game, Maradona has dispelled 
notions is finished. Conversely, Nigeria has proved it is worthy of 
considerable pre-tournament hype. Both should emerge from the group and be 
factors in the knockout round. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: This is the classic youth-vs.- experience matchup. Experience 
usually wins. Greek players were awe-struck in the presence of their Argentine 
heroes. Nigeria has much more talent than Greece but might also be overcome by 
the moment. Argentina wins, 3-2. CHRIS DUFRESNE

 "The most disastrous commentary made yet about this Cup was to declare 
Colombia as the great favorite of the competition.Pele is now the most 
ridiculed sports commentator in action in the United States. The amazing 
enthusiasm of the old star for Colombian football carried him away so much that 
he had himself photographed last week wearing a wig that imitates the hilarious 
and fuzzy-haired blond Valderrama. Absolutely hilarious. Hilarious."

 John Aldridge, who entered the game against Mexico in the second half and 
scored Ireland's only goal Friday, almost didn't make it onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
 A FIFA official, apparently confused because Ireland was making two 
substitutions, grabbed Aldridge and tried to keep him from going onto the 
field. After some shouting, Aldridge simply took his place. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason McAteer had replaced Steve Staunton at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why he did it. It was pathetic. He was dragging me and pulling

ridiculous." HELENE ELLIOTT

 They're not booing, they're yelling Shaibu! Shaibu! or the Russian chant for 
"Score! Score!" 
</P>
<P>
 Or, at least a loose interpretation. Shaibu , pronounced Sha-boo, actually 
means "Puck," and is the verbiage used to cheer on Mother Russia's hockey 
teams. The 200 or so Russian fans who followed their team to the Silverdome, 
where the Russians lost, 3-1, to Sweden on Friday, use the same exclamation for 
soccer.

 Minutes after Italy beat Norway, 1-0, around midnight, Italy time, Thursday, 
city streets all over the country were crowded with hooting, screaming, 
triumphant Italians. Even tourists got caught up in the moment when jubilant 
locals threw themselves into baroque fountains in central Rome. Embarrassed 
Japanese and German tourists were persuaded to shout and cheer along with the 
best of them.

 Franco Baresi, the Italian captain, faces knee surgery after being injured in 
the first half of a 1-0 victory over Norway on Thursday and will be out for the 
rest of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 German midfielder Andy Moeller, anticipated as being one of the stars of the 
World Cup, might be dropped from the world champions' lineup for their last 
Group C match against South Korea at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Moeller has failed to live up to expectations and Coach Berti Vogts said 
Friday that Moeller, 26, seemed to be afraid of contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian star Roberto Baggio was still struggling with being replaced 21 
minutes into Thursday's game against Norway, saying Friday, "I asked (Coach 
Arrigo Sacchi) if he would have taken Maradona off in the same situation. He 
said yes, but I think Maradona would have played the whole game."

 With his rolling amplifier, hand-held microphone and floppy 20-gallon Venetian 
Paradise cap, street performer/improvisational rapper/self-described 
"wordologist" Dr. Geek entertains fans as they walk through the Rose Bowl food 
court, drawing wide-eyed stares and goofy grins from Romanians and Colombians 
who have never quite experienced anything like this. 
</P>
<P>
 Rappeth Dr Geek: 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why we can all be friends,  
</P>
<P>
 even Colombia against the Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 You gotta have friends,

<P>
 you gotta have foes  
</P>

 or else the 4 o'clock game won't go.

<P>
 I ask you this,  
</P>
<P>
 who would we play,  
</P>
<P>
 if everybody was for the USA?  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Geek, who has rapped at other sporting events in Southern California, 
getting TV exposure at the Super Bowl and the Rose Bowl, jumped aboard the 
World Cup bandwagon but admits he had to cram for the event, "trying to learn a 
few words." 
</P>
<P>
 "I did watch the whole first half of the U.S-Switzerland game," the Doctor 
said. "I know they got a forward and a goalkeeper. And there's a free kick and 
a red card. What comes after a red card -- a green card?" MIKE PENNER

 This year's World Cup has a kinship with this year's baseball in one notable 
respect: The ball is juiced. 
</P>
<P>
 Adidas, responding to a request from FIFA, international soccer's governing 
body, to help generate more scoring, has produced the Questra ball for the 
World Cup, much to the delight of everybody but the goalkeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ball bounces higher, flies faster and swerves more than its 
predecessors. It tends toward the minimum size (a regulation ball should be no 
more than 28 inches, nor less than 27), is pumped to greater pressure than in 
the 1990 World Cup and even the heat encountered so far in the United States 
has worked to make it more lively. 
</P>
<P>
 Said an Adidas spokesman: "This has caused the air inside the ball to expand. 
The more pressure, the more spin an outfield player can get on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Adidas introduced an extra layer in the casing of the ball and this extra 
cushion, it claims, helps an outfield player "feel" the ball better. The 
company also claims the ball travels 15% faster, much to the chagrin of those 
charged with keeping it out of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pat Bonner, Ireland's keeper: "This ball goes faster than other balls and 
swerves as well. It is an extra problem for the goalkeepers. When the players 
of the ability that you have here strike the ball, it can really fly."

 A contingent of fans from Kearny, N.J., is following the U.S. team, which has 
three players who played in the town: goalkeeper Tony Meola, Tab Ramos and John 
Harkes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans have the same banner they have been bringing to U.S. games since 
1989. In the group are old friends and players that the three national team 
members grew up with. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stole a bedsheet from the hotel and made the sign," Meola said. "It 
says, 'Love, Kearny.' . . . They were all going to go home after (Wednesday's 
game), but now they are going to stay. A couple of them have lost their jobs as 
of today. I don't think they care." JULIE CART

 Nuttall would not name the players except to say they were under contract to

 Nuttall said the transfer fees ranged from $500,000 to $1.1 million. If a

HOLLYWOOD PARK; SOUTHERN TRUCE APPEARS READY TO ROLL IN THE MILADY HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Southern Truce is retired to become a broodmare next year, trainer 
Roger Stein hopes to make her a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 With 18 victories in 41 races, the 6-year-old daughter of Truce Maker has 
earned $823,888. She was claimed by Stein for $16,000 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Truce could take a big step toward seven figures with a victory in 
the $162,400 Milady Handicap at Hollywood Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of seven fillies and mares entered in the final prep for the July 
24 Vanity Handicap in what will be only her fourth start of 1994. Despite being 
bothered by quarter cracks on both of her front hoofs, Southern Truce has won 
twice this year, in the Santa Monica Handicap at Santa Anita and the Miss 
America Handicap at Golden Gate Fields. Most recently, she was second at 1-2 in 
the Jersey Lilly Handicap at Sam Houston Race Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent workout suggests she is in good shape. Southern Truce went six 
furlongs in 1:12 1/5 on June 16, the best of 20 workouts at the distance for 
the day. However, she is winless in two starts at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this isn't her favorite track, but she's feeling good now," Stein 
said. "I would like to have one more work in her, but any time you go into a 
race you would like to have one more work." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Grade I Milady, which is run at 1 1/16 miles, Southern Truce will be 
making her third start for owners Robert and Janice McNair, who race under the 
name Rose Hill Stable. Newcomers to the sport, the McNairs, who live in Texas, 
also own a percentage of Kentucky Derby runner-up Strodes Creek. They bought 
their share in him shortly before the Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really glad to be training a horse like this for people like them," Stein 
said. "They want to do what's best for the horse and the previous owner was 
interested in just the money. They are really nice people." 
</P>
<P>
 While Southern Truce hasn't shown a fondness for Hollywood Park, Golden Klair 
is a track specialist. The 4-year-old, British-bred filly is unbeaten in three 
races in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 In her most recent appearance, she stayed much closer to the pace than usual 
and beat Likeable Style, another Milady entrant, by half a length in the 
Hawthorne Handicap on May 29. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Golden Klair's second stakes victory of the meeting. A month earlier, 
she had rallied from last to beat Cargo by two lengths in the A Gleam Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Klair is the co-highweight for the Milady Handicap at 119 pounds with 
Likeable Style. 
</P>
<P>
 Away for more than nine months before the Hawthorne, Likeable Style has 
trained sharply since that race. Last year, the 4-year-old Nijinsky II filly 
won the Senorita Breeders' Cup Handicap on the turf at Hollywood Park before 
returning three weeks later to win the Honeymoon Handicap there. 
</P>
<P>
 The other entrants are Zarani Sidi Anna, who will be trying dirt for the first 
time; Andestine, the beaten favorite in the Hawthorne; Lunar Spook, a flop 
since she won the 1993 Ashland Stakes at Keeneland, and Oxava, who would be 
making her first start on the main track after 20 races on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Bobby Frankel will have the favorite in stakes at both Hollywood Park 
and Golden Gate Fields today. 
</P>
<P>
 Mashaallah, who finished seventh of eight in the Hollywood Turf Handicap, is 
the morning line choice in the $75,000-added Jim Murray Handicap at Hollywood 
Park, and Tinners Way is certain to be heavily favored under Kent Desormeaux in 
the $150,000 Golden Gate Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 A winner of eight of 20 races in Europe before coming to the United States, 
Mashaallah will will race on Lasix for the first time in the Murray, at 1 1/2 
miles on turf. Laffit Pincay will ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel also entered Newton's Law in the restricted stakes. The other entrants 
are Bolt The Hatch, Marfamatic, Samourzakan, Time For Lightning and Navire. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking his first U.S. victory after seven defeats, Tinners Way is expected to 
have only five opponents at Golden Gate in the 1 1/16 mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem, who has beaten males in her last two victories, is back among 
her own sex today and also returns to Southern California for the first time in 
more than a year in the $60,000 Ski Goggle, the eighth race on Hollywood Park's 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 An easy winner over Lazor in a match race on May 12, Soviet Problem defeated 
Gundaghia by a length in the Oakland Handicap 18 days later. With regular 
jockey Russell Baze to ride seven horses up north, Chris McCarron will ride the 
4-year-old Moscow Ballet filly for owners John Harris and Don Valpredo and 
trainer Greg Gilchrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Making her comeback in the seven-furlong Ski Goggle is Exchange, a 
multiple-stakes winning mare. Owned by Sid and Jenny Craig and trained by Bill 
Spawr, Exchange hasn't run since finishing last in the Gamely Handicap on May 
30, 1993. Pincay will be aboard.

 Jeremy Williams of Long Beach won by disqualification over Bert Cooper of 
Sharon Hill, Pa., at 1:48 in the seventh round of a scheduled 10-round main 
event at the Grand Olympic Auditorium Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Robert Byrd stopped the fight after Cooper (32-14) spit out his 
mouthpiece for the sixth time.California State Athletic Commission rules 
require a boxer to fight with a mouthpiece for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped the fight because Cooper was continuously spitting out his mouth 
piece," Byrd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, who lost a point after spitting out his mouthpiece in the fourth 
round, said that the protector was too large for his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams (17-1, 13 knockouts), has won two fights at the Olympic since his 
loss by decision to Larry Donald on March 12 in Las Vegas. He was ahead on all 
three judge's cards when the fight was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "My trainer (Joe Goossen) told me to go to his body and forget his head," 
Williams said. "His head was like granite. I hit him hard with a right cross. I 
used a lot of sneaky stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he didn't read my bio, cause I was able to switch-up and hit him hard 
with my left."

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; AT 43, DURAN WILL GET PERHAPS LAST RICH FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are swarming into this city to pay tribute to a legendary survivor, a man 
who has stayed fiercely true to himself while almost every one of his peers has 
fallen into retirement, irrelevance or both. 
</P>
<P>
 What other 43-year-old, in a nontitle bout against an opponent who has never 
excited boxing purists, could generate the pay-per-view sales and get the MGM 
Grand to spring for a $1.2-million site fee? 
</P>
<P>
 Only Roberto Duran. 
</P>
<P>
 He won his first major title 22 years ago, mumbled "No mas" against Sugar Ray 
Leonard in the final months of the Carter administration, made his first big 
comeback by beating Davey Moore in 1983, lost to Robbie Sims in 1986, beat Iran 
Barkley for his fourth world title and then lost to Leonard again in 1989, and 
lost what even the most charitable thought was his last fight, in 1991, to Pat 
Lawlor. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 71-1 after defeating Leonard in their first bout in 1980, has won four 
major belts and fought during the golden era of Hagler, Hearns and Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as always, Duran knew there was mas.  
</P>
<P>
 Three years and seven victories against journeyman fighters later, this town 
is being treated to vintage Duran theater: the roaring, the savage eyes, the 
no-longer puffy face and the newly trim stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the underdog in tonight's 12-round bout against Vinny Pazienza at the 
MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 If he loses, Duran probably won't get a big-time fight like this again. But 
whether he can unleash a vintage "hands of stone" performance against a 
younger, faster Pazienza is almost beyond the point. 
</P>
<P>
 The joy of following Duran, his camp suggests, is the unpredictability of the 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just part of his history -- up and down," said one of his handlers, Mike 
Acri. "And he's ready to go back up again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been fighting for 27 years -- he's had highs and lows, almost all of 
them high, and this is just another step." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a step that will earn Duran a guaranteed $500,000 and a cut of the 
pay-per-view sales. Pazienza has similar deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Duran's manager, Luis DeCubas: "He wants to go down as one of the three 
greatest Latin athletes of all time. I think Roberto Clemente, Pele and Roberto 
are the three greatest." 
</P>
<P>
 Duran seems particularly motivated by Pazienza's apparent lack of respect. 
Pazienza has poked fun at Duran, at times saying Duran has lost to every good 
fighter he was ever matched against and that Duran is and always will be a 
quitter when the chips are down. 
</P>
<P>
 And, probably most enraging, Pazienza has suggested that Duran is hopelessly 
worn down, has no chance of winning, and that this is merely a last payday for 
a cash-poor Duran. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great opportunity to show the whole world what great shape I'm in, 
to show that I'm not shot," Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question. I am taking better care of myself. This is going to be 
one of my great fights." 
</P>
<P>
 Pazienza's trainer, Kevin Rooney, doesn't doubt that the Duran who fights 
tonight won't be the same fighter who has looked so slow recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Duran's going to turn back the clock," Rooney said. "Great fighters 
can do that. It was told to me by Cus D'Amato, and I've seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen Duran do it, against Moore, against Barkley. Ali did it for a 
little bit. Larry Holmes did it against Mike Tyson. For a fleeting moment, they 
can recapture their youth." 
</P>
<P>
 Said DeCubas: "There are certain fights that motivate Duran. He's proven it. 
He's lost to ordinary guys, (in 1982 to Kirkland) Laing, fights that didn't 
mean anything. And he's lost some of the bigger ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when Duran's got to win, he's always won. You go back in his history, he 
had to beat (Pipino) Cuevas (in 1983) to get to Davey Moore. He had to beat 
Moore to get to (Marvin) Hagler. He had to beat Barkley to get to Leonard.  
</P>
<P>
 "When the cards are down, there's nobody better." 
</P>
<P>
 So, what's left for him to want? Beyond the cash, beyond the redemption, 
beyond the anger? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got one more goal to reach," Duran said. "And I'll talk to you about it 
after I beat Pazienza." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He has been fighting recently at the 165-pound limit contracted for this 
fight, but Duran weighed in at 163 1/2 Friday. Pazienza weighed 165. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duran camp got two key concessions. The fight will be in an 18-foot ring, 
giving the quicker Pazienza less space, and the fighters will wear eight-ounce 
gloves, lighter than usual for super-middleweights, giving the hard-hitting 
Duran another edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran lost decisively to Sugar Ray Leonard in their third and final fight in 
1989 when Leonard moved easily around the slower Duran in a bigger ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pazienza can't beat me running," Duran said through an interpreter. "He has 
to stand sometime and fight, a little bit. With an 18-foot ring and eight-ounce 
gloves, he can run but he can't hide that much." 
</P>
<P>
 And the comparison to the Leonard fight? 
</P>
<P>
 "Pazienza and Leonard, that's like comparing a Rolls-Royce to a Chevrolet," 
Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Haugen the spotlight: Best moment of the last few days? Although it is not 
customary for the undercard fighters to insult the main-event performers, Greg 
Haugen, who is on the undercard against Tony Lopez, is no friend of Pazienza's, 
having fought him three times and lost twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to speak first at the final news conference, Haugen, peeved because 
someone told him that Pazienza had called him "a twerp," took time to swipe at 
Pazienza. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I recall," Haugen said, "I am not a twerp." Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 As the MGM Grand stages the Roberto Duran-Vince Pazienza fight, its first as 
sole promoter, the hotel-casino's relationship with Don King, the man who has 
promoted most of the MGM's bouts, appears to be growing frosty. King has one 
fight left on his promotional contract with the MGM -- a September bout 
matching Julio Cesar Chavez against an opponent to be determined. King is 
putting on the Orlin Norris-Arthur Williams World Boxing Assn. cruiserweight 
title bout July 2 at the Mirage, which has not been active in boxing recently. 
According to Dennis Finfrock, an MGM Grand vice president, the hotel plans to 
continue working with outside promoters -- such as the July 29 Oscar De La 
Hoya-Jorge Paez bout promoted by Bob Arum, and a Nov. 5 heavyweight title fight 
between Michael Moorer and George Foreman promoted by Arum and Dan Duva, but 
hopes to stage many more of its own promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 When the July 15 Riddick Bowe card at Hollywood Park was canceled, it took 
International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Council light-flyweight 
champion Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez's scheduled undercard bout down with it. 
Gonzalez will fight next July 8 vs. Carlos Eluaiza at the Forum. . . . The 
Forum is also planning two world title fights, an Aug. 15 card featuring a 
defense by International Boxing Federation super-flyweight champion Julio Cesar 
Borboa, and an Aug. 26 title defense by World Boxing Assn. junior-lightweight 
title holder Genaro Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo Nunez, who gave Oscar De La Hoya a relatively tough fight last August 
before De La Hoya stopped him in the fourth round on cuts, should provide a 
standard for measuring where undefeated lightweight Shane Mosley belongs on the 
list of up-and-comers. Their bout will be Thursday night at the Irvine 
Marriott. Mosley (11-0, 10 knockouts) was an amateur contemporary of De La Hoya 
and the Ruelas brothers but has had slower going as a professional.

THE POND WILL THE TEST WATERS WITH GABRIEL SHOW; POP MUSIC: THE ARENA EXPLORES 
'A NEW AREA' TONIGHT BY PRESENTING AN EVENT -- THE HOTTEST TICKET IN MEXICO -- 
AIMED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY AT LATINOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Pond of Anaheim, which in its first year scored a splashy pop-music coup 
by landing Barbra Streisand's only Southern California engagement, will test 
the local Latino market today with a concert by Mexico's biggest pop star, Juan 
Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 Pond spokesman John J. Nicoletti said Thursday that tickets were selling 
briskly for the event and that a big walk-up crowd is also expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel has in the past sold out multiple-day engagements at the Universal 
Amphitheatre and last year performed a benefit at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. A 
1990 concert by Gabriel at Santa Ana Stadium drew 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pond has been the site of a mariachi festival, but this is the first pop 
event geared almost exclusively to a Latino audience. Although Gabriel has sold 
more than 15 million albums worldwide, he has had little crossover success in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new area for us," Nicoletti said, but with the county's large Latino 
population, further forays into the market are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel, 42, is a hugely successful singing star whose splashy stage shows 
have helped make him Mexico's most popular concert draw. He has written more 
than 600 songs, mainly romantic ballads, many of which have been recorded by 
other performers. His detours into mariachi and ranchera music give his 
concerts and records a roots appeal that balances his pop sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare interview for the media-shy star, Gabriel told The Times last year 
about his childhood in an orphanage after his father died and his mother 
decided she could not raise him alone. He said the experience helped give him 
the toughness to survive in the competitive pop music world and inspired him to 
start and support an orphanage in Chihuahua, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the orphanage "was a great experience, and it's one reason I can say 
I'm proud and at peace with myself," he said. Gabriel added that he is not 
bitter about his upbringing: "The most important thing is that I'm here now 
helping so that others don't have to suffer like me." 
</P>
<P>
 This month will see the U.S. release of Gabriel's first studio album in eight 
years, following a protracted legal battle with his record label, BMG. The new 
album, "Gracias por Esperar" ("Thanks for Waiting") will be out Tuesday, and, 
according to the BMG International office in Los Angeles, the album has already 
sold 500,000 copies in Mexico alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The single, "Pero Que Necesidad" ("But What Is the Need?"), has been playing 
for more than a month on local Spanish-language radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps another example of his place in Mexican music is the respect among 
artists of other genres, notably young Mexican rockers who often are critical 
of the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a product of the machinery; he wasn't invented by millions of 
dollars," said Roco, singer for Mexico City's Maldita Vecindad, one of the 
country's top three rock bands. "He's a truly popular icon who was embraced and 
made a star by the people." 
</P>

RITUALS DIE, OTHERS COME OF AGE; CULTURE: LIFE-CYCLE TRADITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN 
INHERITED, ADAPTED OR DISOWNED IN AMERICA ARE THE TOPIC OF A FULLERTON EXHIBIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Barbara Loh wanted to celebrate the birth of her son, Jason, in traditional 
Chinese fashion. So exactly one month after his birth, she put together a mahn 
yueh family party. She was, however, willing to take tradition only so far: 
Snacking on the customary pickled pig knuckles was one thing this new mother 
couldn't do. 
</P>
<P>
 "My 89-year-old grandmother made up tons of this stuff," writes Loh, a 
second-generation Chinese American from New York, in an account of Jason's 
birth in 1986. "She said it would build up my health and rid my body of any 
germs that I might have gotten from (giving) birth. I personally could not 
stomach the smell nor appreciate her culinary efforts. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Loh's use of some ancient Chinese birthing rites -- and her rejection of 
others -- illustrates an essential theme underlying Fullerton Museum Center's 
new exhibit, opening today, about the ways Americans mark birth, coming of age, 
marriage and death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rites of Passage in America: Traditions of the Life Cycle," organized by 
Philadelphia's Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies, explores "how all this plays 
out in American society," where long-held practices -- either indigenous or 
those brought here by myriad immigrant groups -- often are modernized, if not 
abandoned altogether, says curator Pamela B. Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some families will keep some traditions," Nelson said, "some will keep 
others; some won't keep any, and some will keep them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Items on view include an early 1900s family album, frilly favors from a 
quinceanera (Spanish for "15th birthday party"), a dazzling, rainbow-colored 
sari worn by the bride at a Pakistani wedding and a video of the 1983 New 
Orleans jazz funeral for musician Gate Johnson, during which Johnson's friends 
made music and danced exuberantly. Loh's experience is represented by a photo 
of her 1-month-old son, her written account and the special outfit he wore for 
the mahn yueh party. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, humans embrace rituals because they help us feel that we're not 
mere specks of dust rushing nowhere in the vast siphon of space, said Nelson, 
now on sabbatical from the Balch Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rituals we practice are rituals because they are done over and over 
through generations," Nelson said in a recent phone interview from her 
Philadelphia home. "This links us to our past, our ancestors and to future 
generations; we become members not only of our contemporary community but of 
those that have come before and will come after us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, they convey status," Nelson said. "As you go through your life, you 
have these events that let the community know that you have made it from one 
stage to the next, that you are officially an adult, for example." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first half of this century, first-generation immigrants tended to 
drop the customs of their homeland, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really was a reason to want to Americanize," she said. "If you wanted 
to get ahead or even survive, your best bet was to change your name and not 
look strange or different." 
</P>
<P>
 Second-generation Americans have taken greater interest in cultural 
traditions, she said. That's partly as a result of the "ethnic-pride movement," 
she said, which conveys "a sense that you can be American and also have an 
ethnic identity." 
</P>
<P>
 Loh's parents, for example, had not practiced Chinese birthing traditions, 
"but her grandmother wanted her to use them, and she in turn was interested in 
reviving them. She adapted those parts that she felt fit into her lifestyle and 
her sense of what would be meaningful for her, and pretty much dropped the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "After her child was born, she wasn't supposed to take showers either," Nelson 
said. "There's a belief that when a woman gives birth, her balance of yin and 
yang is thrown off. She has too much yin, the female, cold, dark side, and that 
she needs to therefore eat only warm foods and not get chilled (by bathing). 
She did take showers, however; she was not willing to forgo that." 
</P>
<P>
 Another instance of revitalization and adaptation of one of the rites least 
practiced in contemporary U.S. society -- coming of age -- is Unyago , an 
"initiation into adulthood" combining old and new that has been developed by 
some black community and religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of these groups "saw that their children needed a serious opportunity 
to learn about their past as well as issues that traditional rituals couldn't 
cover," Nelson said. Those modern problems include "sexuality, how to open a 
bank account and balance checkbooks," on which classes were given, along with 
those on black history, during the Unyago observance, "things they felt their 
children needed to know to be responsible adults." 
</P>
<P>
 The practice of death rites also has greatly diminished in this country, where 
death mostly takes place in a hospital, rather than at home, with professionals 
rather than family members handling all aspects of the burial, including 
preparing and cleansing of the body, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 With this "sanitation" of death, she said, came the unfortunate loss of many 
traditional ways that helped communities, families and individuals cope with 
death, such as long grieving periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there's an expectation that you'll be back at work in the next week, like 
you're supposed to grin and bear it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are signs, if not yet widespread, that mourning customs are 
gaining popularity, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Fullerton Union High School student Angel Gonzalez was killed in a 1992 
shooting a few doors away from the Fullerton Museum Center, his friends 
spray-painted their names on a nearby concrete block wall, much as other 
Latinos elsewhere in the country paint memorial walls near sites of accidental 
or violent deaths, said Fullerton Museum Center curator Lynn La Bate. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the names were painted over, La Bate said, but "it allowed people 
to acknowledge the event, to grieve and mourn." 
</P>

FAYE DUNAWAY BLASTS 'CAPRICIOUS' LLOYD WEBBER; THEATER: WOULD-BE 'SUNSET 
BOULEVARD' STAR QUESTIONS HER FIRING AND THE DECISION BY THE PRODUCER-COMPOSER 
TO CLOSE MUSICAL SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling Andrew Lloyd Webber's decision to close "Sunset Boulevard" Sunday "yet 
another capricious act by a capricious man," actress Faye Dunaway spoke 
publicly Friday morning for the first time since learning that she would not 
take over the role of Norma Desmond in the Shubert Theatre production.  
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Webber officials fired her on Tuesday and announced the closing of the 
Los Angeles production Thursday, saying her singing was not up to the demands 
of the musical's lead role. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Webber "has been peripatetic throughout the entire process, changing his 
mind from day to day," Dunaway said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that she is "very saddened" by the producer-composer's decision. 
Asked if it would affect her career, she replied, "If I had left the charges 
unanswered, the damages would have been severe." 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Webber could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway, who was scheduled to begin preview performances July 5, coolly told a 
crowd of reporters gathered at a Sherman Oaks home near the location where she 
is currently shooting "Don Juan de Marco and the Centerfold" that she has 
contacted a lawyer about her departure from "Sunset" and intends to take legal 
action. She wouldn't answer further questions about details of that action, but 
said she expects to be paid for her full six-month contract.  
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway said she learned of her dismissal late Tuesday from her manager, and 
complained that Lloyd Webber himself has yet to call her. Patti LuPone, who 
premiered the role in London and was initially cast to take it to Broadway, 
also has expressed anger that the producer-composer never called her personally 
to tell her he was replacing her with Glenn Close for the New York show. 
</P>
<P>
 One point of contention between Dunaway and Lloyd Webber was her vocal range. 
"When I auditioned for Mr. Lloyd Webber (last month), I sang in my range. He 
cast me in that range, only later deciding to push me into a higher one, which 
I worked to accommodate." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she believed that director Trevor Nunn was defending her use of her 
own range to Lloyd Webber. On Monday, Dunaway sang again for Lloyd Webber and, 
she said, he was "anything but reticent in his praise." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no doubt I could have opened on July 5 with a vocal performance 
that would more than achieve the requirements of the role of Norma Desmond. On 
Monday night Mr. Lloyd Webber agreed. Sometime on Tuesday, he apparently 
changed his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The vocal coach who trained Dunaway for "Sunset" for nearly two months, Bob 
Corff, said in a separate interview Friday that "no one has ever worked harder" 
and "that effort won't be wasted." He predicted other singing opportunities 
will come her way. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was getting stronger all along," Corff said, but "I don't know what 
happened after she went into rehearsals." He said he hasn't seen her in three 
weeks.

'YEAH, I'M A DUCK, SO WHAT?'; THE IRREVERENT 'DUCKMAN' IS LOOKING FOR VIEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Angrier than Sean Penn in a mob of paparazzi, more aroused than Madonna after 
a visit to an NBA locker room, able to offend any politically correct notion 
with a single flap of his beak. Look! Deep in the late-night hinterlands of 
cable. It's a bird. It's a plane (er, pain). It's "Duckman." 
</P>
<P>
 He could be the funniest duck in the world. But airing Saturdays at 10:30 p.m. 
on cable's USA network, the animated, foul-talking fowl is a long way from 
supplanting Daffy or Donald as America's favorite quacker, even if he has 
become a party-night hero on college campuses around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gratifying to know that college kids have gatherings to watch the show 
because we are after that kind of hipness," said Ron Osborn, who, with his 
partner, Jeff Reno, writes and executive produces the series. "But my response 
to them is, 'Go home and watch it separately so our ratings can go up!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The first 13 episodes of "Duckman," which premiered last March, averaged about 
1 million households each week -- not bad for cable, especially since it airs 
at a time when the bulk of its target audience is out on the town, "or drunk," 
Reno joked. But having come out of network television, the producers admit to 
being frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never worked so hard on something that was seen by so few," Osborn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the ratings and critical acclaim (the Wall Street Journal this week 
named it one of the 10 best shows of the year) have been sufficient for USA to 
order a new batch of 13 episodes. Until those are ready early next year, the 
first 13 will continue in reruns.  
</P>
<P>
 Reno, 40, and Osborn, 42, have difficulty describing their show in succinct 
terms. Based on a 1989 underground comic book by Everett Peck, who works on the 
animation end of the program for the Klasky Csupo studio, "Duckman" centers on 
an irascible, sarcastic duck, voiced maniacally by "Seinfeld's" Jason 
Alexander. Alexander has described his character as a cross between Maxwell 
Smart, Groucho Marx and Jackie Gleason's Ralph Kramden. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's also a family show: Duckman, a widower, lives with his sister-in-law, 
his oldest son Ajax and his two-headed son named Mambo and Charles. He has a 
best friend and partner in his detective agency, Cornfed, a pig. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers say their best episodes hit on an emotional twang about love, 
friendship or fatherhood, often a sad, even poignant note that suggests 
Duckman's (and perhaps Everyman's) luckless plight in a world that continually 
dumps on him. 
</P>
<P>
 What probably stands out most, though, is the irreverent skewering of 
everything from television to modern artists to sexual harassment to the 
information superhighway to tabloid journalism -- and, especially, to political 
correctness.  
</P>
<P>
 In the last episode of the first batch, for example, a group of stand-up 
comedians -- parodies of Andrew Dice Clay, Jerry Seinfeld and Roseanne and Tom 
Arnold -- hire Duckman to dig up dirt on a new comic who has eclipsed them in 
popularity with an act that is entirely free of offensive jokes. Duckman is 
outraged: 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't let a lowdown scum like that put you guys out of work. This world is 
depressing enough without a few insults, slurs and good honest laughs at other 
people's expense. A case like this you take for the principle."  
</P>
<P>
 "We do love social satire and we love to tilt at windmills, but basically the 
show is about this silly duck," Osborn said. "He is a character that can rant 
about a lot of things that we would like to say, even if we can't admit it in 
polite company. But he's also this guy who gets up every day and, against all 
odds, pushes a rock up a hill that every evening rolls back down on top of him. 
He is a jerk, but also vulnerable, a victim of this cesspool of a world, 
somewhat like all of us, and I think that makes him very human." 
</P>
<P>
 With its heady content -- one minute making fun of Andy Warhol, the next 
engaged in a two-headed debate over the merits of Jungian vs. Freudian 
philosophy -- the show is obviously aimed at adults, even if the wild colors 
and talking animals probably appeal to children as well. The producers said 
there's nothing in the show they'd be embarrassed for children to see -- they 
even made Duckman quit smoking (though he has lapsed once or twice) -- but USA 
has deliberately scheduled it late to preclude most youngsters from stumbling 
upon it. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno and Osborn, who have written for "Moonlighting," "Night Court" and "Mork 
& Mindy," said that "Duckman" has been the most creatively rewarding experience 
of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no restrictions. There's no reason you can't write a scene on the 
moon, and if a character gives you problems you can just erase him," Reno said. 
"The good news and bad news is that you can go anywhere your imagination wants 
to go. So it's daunting, but at the same time really fun." 
</P>
<P>
 While he doubts that they will stay in animation for the rest of their working 
days, Reno says that many of the most innovative and edgy programs on 
television these days are animated -- "The Simpsons," "Ren & Stimpy," even 
"Beavis and Butt-head" -- because the networks tend to dilute most live-action 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are just ape over this idea of likability -- that every character has to 
be likable," Reno said. "But animation -- I guess because people know it's not 
literally real -- gives you and the character more latitude. And that lets you 
comment on all kinds of things without fear that someone is going to say, 
'That's too mean' or 'Too intellectual' or 'This guy is not lovable.' "

 For the opening concert of the 20th annual Seal Beach Chamber Music Festival 
on Thursday, director Alan Parker got together 13 local free-lance string 
players, dubbed them the Haydn Orchestra and presented second-echelon works by 
Purcell, Janacek, Mendelssohn and Haydn. The results were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 While one could certainly appreciate the general vitality of the playing, its 
directness and even, occasionally, its sensitivity, no one was going to confuse 
this group with a full-time chamber orchestra, or Parker with a veteran 
conductor. These performances were basically straightforward run-throughs, with 
niceties of intonation, tone, ensemble polish and interpretation missing. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have been a pleasant enough evening for many of those in attendance at 
McGaugh School auditorium, but there was little here for the serious listener. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Philharmonic violinist Lawrence Sonderling proved a welcome guest, 
however, as soloist in Haydn's Violin Concerto in G. He sketched its Rococo 
lines with quiet elegance, took its virtuoso hurdles with clean and poised 
precision and shaped its modest tunes with singing lightness. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert opened with Purcell's overture and eight little dances -- 
hornpipes, airs, a jig, a march -- to the play, "The Married Beau, or The 
Curious Impertinent," amiable, cheerful tidbits.  
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, Parker led accounts of Janacek's early Suite for Strings, 
a quaint amalgam of Wagner and Dvorak, and Mendelssohn's String Symphony No. 
10, written when the composer was 14. 
</P>
<P>
 All these pieces seemed to show that even the big-name composers wrote music 
not especially worth contemplating at length.  
</P>
<P>
 Parker supplied no-nonsense direction, and the orchestra responded with spirit 
and sturdiness.

 He Writes the Musicals: Pop star Barry Manilow received a standing ovation 
from a celebrity-filled audience in London Thursday night at the premiere of 
his $3-million musical "Copacabana," based on his 1976 hit single of the same 
name. The show, which marks Manilow's debut in London as a writer, opened after 
a regional tour in Britain. The jury's still out, though, if it will be a West 
End hit, especially after its cool critical response. The Daily Express found 
"Copacabana" a "nerve-shattering, stunningly bad experience." "Witless musical 
is a new Mani-low," said the headline in Today. Charles Spencer, though, said 
in the Daily Telegraph: "I enjoyed 'Copacabana' and enjoyed it enormously."

 Calling All Mikes: Home Box Office is launching an intensive, multi-city 
casting search to find the lead for HBO Pictures' upcoming Mike Tyson bio 
picture. The film, according to the cable outlet, will deal with the imprisoned 
boxer's pursuit of the American dream and "the difficulty of healing the 
psychological scars of growing up in the ghetto." The drama is based on Jose 
Torres' "Fire and Fear: The Inside Story of Mike Tyson." Open casting calls for 
"Tyson" will be held locally July 1 at Screenland Studios in Burbank. Tyson 
wanna-bes should be between 17-22 years of age, 5 feet, 10 inches to 6 feet in 
height, 200-230 lbs. and have a muscular physique. They should also be able to 
act, and some boxing experience would be helpful. The casting directors are not 
accepting calls.

 Up for Auction: A 3,000-year-old Assyrian relief, discovered in the snack shop 
of an English boys school, is expected to provide the school with a 
$1.1-million bonanza when it goes up for auction July 6 at Christie's in 
London. The meticulously carved stone panel, from the palace of King 
Ashurnasirpal II in modern Iraq, was excavated in the mid-19th Century by 
archeologist Sir Henry Layard and given to Canford School in Dorset by Sir John 
Guest, master of Canford Manor and a benefactor of Layard. The relief was 
installed in the boarding school, and heavily whitewashed over the years. 
Scholars believed it was a plaster cast until recently, when two specialists

THEATER REVIEW; THIS BOY'S LIFE: PASSIONATE, MOVING ROAD TO MANHOOD

 The title, "Cross-Dressing in the Depression," is the only false note in the 
Southern California premiere of a short, haunting new memory play by Erin 
Cressida Wilson, a Theater E/Sledgehammer Theatre co-production staged at the 
latter's church-like theater here. 
</P>
<P>
 This erotic and passionate tale of one boy's sexual and spiritual awakening in 
the Depression evokes flashes of Tennessee Williams with its painfully wise and 
witty understanding of the interlocking nerves of memory, desire and yearning. 
</P>
<P>
 And a young and talented theater company, Theater E, working in co-production 
with Sledgehammer, mines all the sweetness and sadness from a richly suggestive 
script. 
</P>
<P>
 An old man, Old Wilder narrates the tale of himself as a young boy growing up 
in Denver during the Depression. In a tough time, Wilder has it tougher than 
most. His father has been sent to prison; his mother tells him she's going to 
work as a maid, and, just as he is starting adolescence, he is sent to a 
brothel as a dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the Winter of Disappearance," he remembers. "The winter of bread lines 
and Melora. The winter I ate icicles for dessert and fell asleep to the sick 
good smell of kerosene and the squeak of a hundred beds. Franklin and Eleanor 
were in the White House. Maggie and Jiggs were in the funnies. And Prince 
Albert? He was in the can." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a three-actor ensemble with one actor as Old Wilder, one as young Wilder 
and a third as Wilder's mother, Jessie, and as the prostitute, Melora. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater E's artistic director, Lisa Portes, directs the piece. Her casting 
choices may seem startling at first -- particularly with a white actress, Linda 
Castro, as Old Wilder and black actor Damen Scranton, as the younger version.  
</P>
<P>
 But acting triumphs over preconceptions. Castro turns in a startlingly true 
and funny performance as the old man, getting everything just right, from the 
mannerisms, the self-mocking humor to a little shuffling dance. Scranton -- 
wide-eyed, intense, fervent -- captures the painful yearning of this man's 
youth like a force of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jessie/Melora, Andrea Renee Portes, the director's sister, lends the 
mystery and beauty necessary to fascinate, frustrate and inspire Wilder from 
youth to age. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Wilder, who grows up in dark times, is seized by the idea 
of turning darkness into light. It's an image exquisitely realized by Wilder 
gazing into light pouring up out of an old metal bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of many memorable tableaux, from young Wilder watching his mother 
wash her back to Old Wilder offering Melora his glass eye. To serve the story, 
there is some nudity, none of it gratuitous. It is done tenderly and adds to 
the rawness of the story's emotional truths. 
</P>
<P>
 The design crew also does class work in the stark staging area of 
Sledgehammer: a black, former funeral home with pillars and a high stage. 
Michelle Riel's set -- a sawdust floor and broken planking, a bed angled up as 
the center of the action, two birds in a cage, a mountain of sawdust supporting 
an old Victrola -- tells its own story of the passing of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierre Clavel's lighting is moody, romantic and, as needed, harshly on target. 
Michael Roth, resident composer of the La Jolla Playhouse, supplies original 
music that helps create a mood without distracting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Larson's costume design artfully suggests the dreamy memories Wilder had 
of the women in his life while keeping Wilder's own clothing realistically 
rough. 
</P>
<P>
 As for that title, well, director Portes has explained it in interviews as an 
erasing of the boundaries between male and female. Whatever. It's just too 
forced for such a lusciously earthy and poignant play.

MUSICALLY, HE LIVES FOR THE MOMENT; POP MUSIC: GUITARIST OTTMAR LIEBERT 
BELIEVES IN THE POWER OF IMPROVISATION. HE BRINGS HIS FLAMENCO-FLAVORED SOUNDS 
TO THE COACH HOUSE THIS EVENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flamenco-influenced, multi-style guitarist Ottmar Liebert has always been 
drawn to the elusive nature of music. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a fascination with something that couldn't be controlled, certainly 
nothing that you could logically think through," says Liebert, 32, interviewed 
by phone from a tour stop in Denver this week. "As a kid, I was logical and 
good at math, and I discovered that music was a place for me to hide from that, 
to develop another side. Because of music, I became a more well-rounded 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as a headliner at medium-to-large venues around the world, the artist, 
who plays the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano tonight, explores that 
unpredictable nature of music via a series of listenable, sometimes fervid 
compositions that mix flamenco, pop, jazz, rock, funk and Gypsy-based music. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these pieces stay the same from night to night, but most contain 
lengthy passages where the outcome can't be predetermined: the instrumental 
solos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only through improvising that you can hit that other place where you're 
actually creating something in that moment, in the presence of that audience," 
says Liebert, who appears at the Coach House with his band, Luna Negra. "I feel 
that if you're playing the same piece exactly the same way and with the same 
solo, you'd almost be like a trained dog at the circus. While some tunes are 
similar each night, others are very open where there are whole sections where 
we don't know what happens next." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Liebert on guitar and lute, Luna Negra features Calvin Hazen on 
guitar, John Gagan on bass, Domenico Camardella on piano and Mark Clark on 
drums. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebert's type of performance offers scant vocals -- his 1993 Epic Records 
album, "The Hours Between Day + Night," contains a Spanish-language version of 
Marvin Gaye's "Mercy, Mercy Me." He says this style of presentation places 
responsibility not only on the musicians, to give the notes life, but also on 
the audience, which must pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instrumental music is like a book; it needs active listening," says the man 
who these days dubs his offerings "ambient flamenco groove." "It gets the 
imagination going in order to make a connection. Speech is tentative at best in 
relaying an experience. Music can do things that no words can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Instrumental music, Liebert feels, takes both player and listener to a realm 
rarely found in everyday existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most people, music is the most mystical experience they ever have," he 
asserts. "Music is still a place where people begin listening to a song, then 
start drifting, then come back at end of the song. All around, that's about 
discovery for myself, and through myself, for others." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Liebert, like most musicians, plays first for himself.

 "I do make music that I want to hear," he says. "If I worried about what the 
audience wanted to hear, I'd be like a politician. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't make everybody happy. . . . Sometimes the music is darker, sometimes 
it's more happy. It doesn't matter as long as it's honest. There's nothing 
wrong with something that's depressing, that doesn't make you happy. At the 
same time, there seem to be a lot of people who have a problem with anything 
that's happy. They tend to think it's not an honest emotion."

 Liebert's smooth and sometimes lyrical melodies, assertive rhythms and 
resilient-to-biting guitar sound has become considerably popular in five years. 
His debut album, 1989's "Nouveau Flamenco" (Higher Octave Music), which has 
sold almost a million copies, has been on Billboard's New Age charts for 211 
weeks (it's currently No. 15). "The Hours Between Day + Night" is No. 5 and 
"has gone gold in New Zealand," says the guitarist, laughing. He tours 
consistently. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebert was born in Germany, started playing guitar at 11 and had studied both 
classical and flamenco styles by the time he arrived in Boston more than a 
decade ago. There, he played in rock and R&B bands before deciding to move to 
Los Angeles. On the way out, he stopped in Sante Fe, N.M., to see a friend, and 
stayed. He makes his home there today. 
</P>
<P>
 After performing his brew of flamenco-mixed-with-whatever music in Sante Fe 
restaurants, Liebert was asked to make an album to be produced by a local 
artist, Frank Howell. Originally called "Marita: Shadows and Storms," the album 
was sold by Howell to Higher Octave and became "Nouveau Flamenco." 
</P>
<P>
 Making his debut wasn't the easiest of experiences, says Liebert. 
</P>
<P>
 "The engineer kept saying, 'This isn't going to work,' and I told him, 'Hey, 
what have you got to lose? You're getting paid.' I didn't get paid, but my luck 
was that the album paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 * Ottmar Liebert and Luna Negra play tonight at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. 7 and 9:30 p.m. $26.50. (714) 496-8930.

POP BEAT: DRIVE LIKE JEHU SWERVING OUT OF THE SHADOWS; THE GROUP, CLOSELY 
ALIGNED WITH ROCKET FROM THE CRYPT, ANOTHER SAN DIEGO BAND, IS DESTINED TO 
ESTABLISH ITS OWN IDENTITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drive Like Jehu is an excellent and daring band from San Diego's much touted 
indie rock scene, but it is still having trouble establishing its own identity. 
The quartet is so closely aligned with scene leaders Rocket From the Crypt, the 
association makes Jehu -- following Rocket out of San Diego -- sort of like a 
caboose. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the two bands sound nothing alike. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for lumping the bands together: Both share member John Reis, who 
sings for Rocket and plays guitar for Jehu, and both were signed around the 
same time early last year to powerhouse Interscope Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk that the band was signed to Interscope only because the label's main 
interest -- Rocket -- insisted on a package deal, makes Jehu look like the 
tag-along little brother. It's enough to make most bands resentful and bitchy, 
but Jehu's guitarist and singer Rick Froberg tries to be defiantly blase about 
the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not afraid of getting overshadowed by Rocket," insists Froberg in a 
conservative, no-frills tone that's the antithesis of Jehu's experimental, 
spontaneous sound. "If it happens, it happens. We're not in competition with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, we cooperate with them on a regular basis. We share a practice room 
and all of us are friends. I used to think the association was a bad thing, but 
I guess there's a lot worse bands you can be associated with. Regardless, it 
doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 He's right -- it doesn't matter. Judging from the band's two albums, including 
the recent "Yank Crime," Drive Like Jehu is a band that deserves hype all its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-year-old group -- which also includes bassist Mike Kennedy and drummer 
Mark Trombino -- unleashes an unpredictable and captivating sound somewhere 
between the flailing buzz of a snapped high wire and the suburban-rock clamor 
of a drunken block party.  
</P>
<P>
 The reserved Froberg must store up all his more volatile emotions for the 
banshee-style screams and crazed, experimental guitar work that drives Jehu. He 
manipulates guitar feedback into surreal, bird-like chirps, then pits it 
against the band's manic, then eerily calm tunes. It's a unique sound that at 
times is difficult to put up with, but it's a welcome challenge. As with a 
Rubik's Cube, half the fun is getting there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try not to give people too much to grasp (besides) the music," Froberg 
says. "The whole idea is to have something you can draw your own conclusions 
off of."  
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, listeners will be able to do just that as Drive Like Jehu moves 
beyond the status of sidekick and blasts off without the extra weight of Rocket 
holding it down. 
</P>
<P>
 While Down South: In the wake of Rocket and Jehu, San Diego bands are still 
being scooped up by outside labels homing in on the scene.  
</P>
<P>
 So how come most of those first signees with albums already out, such as Rust, 
Lucy's Fur Coat, Inch and A Miniature, seem to be slipping by unnoticed? 
</P>
<P>
 Part of it may be that in an attempt to cash in on the latest buzz (see 
Seattle), record companies picked up bands as indiscriminately as a dog does 
fleas. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: Some of the bands aren't very good. Take Lucy's Fur Coat, for 
example. The band, on Relativity and distributed through Sony, hardly makes a 
mark in the indie world, let alone the larger scope of alternative rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the lack of attention may be that other bands just weren't 
ready. Rust -- which plays heavy, bombarding rock -- had only put out one 
single and barely toured before being picked up by Atlantic. It never had a 
chance to develop inside the city's insular scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the record companies should have waited for Rocket From the Crypt to 
release a major-label debut (which it will this summer), so there was at least 
a major ice-breaker, like Nirvana was for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 But bands like Fluf are getting smart. The tuneful punk rock trio, headed by 
the infamous San Diego scenester O (short for Otis), has had several offers, 
but has turned them all down. The band's waiting for the right time and label. 
Meanwhile, it is staying with local indie label Headhunter (a subsidiary of the 
also independent Cargo Records). 
</P>
<P>
 Cargo spokesperson and San Diego native Bryan Spevak says: "In a year from now 
those labels are gonna look back and really have second thoughts about the 
decisions they made. It's great to hype a city, but the music has to back it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Life Outside Rocket: Yes, there was rock 'n' roll life in San Diego before 
Eddie Vedder and Rocket From the Crypt recently grabbed national attention. 
Among the musicians who either came from or spent their early years in the 
city: barfly deluxe Tom Waits, confrontational performance artist Diamanda 
Galas, folkie Cindy Lee Berryhill, the sarcastic Mojo Nixon, glam-gods Ratt and 
dinosaur rockers Iron Butterfly. Diverse enough?

WHY THEY CLOSED 'BLVD.' AND RODE INTO SUNSET; NEWS ANALYSIS: BOX-OFFICE SALES 
HINTED AT A DARK FUTURE FOR THE FAYE DUNAWAY VERSION OF THE ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER 
MUSICAL. VENTURE WAS LABELED TOO RISKY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 So the show doesn't always go on, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden announcement Thursday that Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical "Sunset 
Boulevard" will close Sunday after Glenn Close's final performance leads 
inevitably to the question of why the dismissal of Faye Dunaway -- the 
erstwhile-anointed replacement for Close -- requires the entire production to 
shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 Close and the rest of the L.A. cast are moving to Broadway, where the show 
opens in November, and Dunaway had been scheduled to take over the role of 
Norma Desmond at the Shubert Theatre in Century City on July 5, but was told 
this week that her singing was not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of mouth about Karen Mason -- the standby who filled in for Close during 
13 1/2 performances at the Shubert Theatre -- was very good. The producers had 
already agreed to let Mason do the role for a week in between Close's departure 
and Dunaway's arrival. Couldn't Mason have continued indefinitely while a star 
of greater magnitude was sought and rehearsed -- if one was even necessary? 
</P>
<P>
 A star was indeed necessary, says Edgar Dobie, head of American operations for 
producer-composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's production company. Even though the 
show had stacked up more than $4 million in advance ticket sales, most of it 
was spread over a 10-week period. This meant the box office was doing 
approximately $400,000 a week -- which doesn't begin to match the show's weekly 
operating costs, estimated at between $650,000 and $675,000. If Dunaway proved 
to be a bomb, the show's receipts could have taken a swift dive. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the enormous resources of Lloyd Webber, who has had phenomenal 
worldwide success with shows like "Phantom of the Opera" and "Jesus Christ 
Superstar," that loss was not something his company was willing to risk, and 
paying off ticket holders and Dunaway was preferable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more appropriate to leave here on a high," Dobie said. 
</P>
<P>
 How much the sudden cancellation would cost the Shubert Theatre in lost income 
for the use of the facility was not immediately clear. Repeated calls to 
Shubert officials were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Advance ticket sales last December on the eve of the show's opening were much 
higher -- approximately $10 million. Although there was still widespread 
interest in "Sunset" -- last week's gross set a record of $948,000 and this 
week's probably will go higher -- the company feared that interest would not 
last without a big star playing Norma. When Mason substituted for Close as many 
as 200 ticket holders at each performance requested refunds, with more asking 
for exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean the show can't stand on its own? It can in London, Dobie said. 
The original London star, Patti LuPone, and her successor, Betty Buckley -- 
despite their avid fans -- are not movie celebrities at the level of Dunaway or 
Close. Dobie believes Los Angeles audiences need the draw of a name. "When you 
go to London, you go to see shows," Dobie said. When you go to Los Angeles, you 
go to see stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, one big exception comes immediately to mind. During the long L.A. 
run of Lloyd Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera," Davis Gaines played the 
Phantom the longest, despite the fact that he was unknown to Los Angeles 
audiences before taking the role. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gaines didn't don the Phantom's mask until the show's momentum was set 
after a two-year run with well-known actors Michael Crawford and Robert 
Guillaume, Dobie pointed out. By the time Gaines joined the cast, the show had 
acquired a life of its own -- and a cult of devotees who returned to see it 
dozens of times. 
</P>
<P>
 Other huge musicals have enjoyed long runs here without big stars, but they 
were not musicals about Hollywood. "Norma is a movie star," Dobie pointed out 
-- indeed, one of the songs about her is called "The Greatest Star of All." In 
L.A., he said, "it made a lot of sense" to take that title literally when the 
show was cast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Understudy Mason, the non-star who lost what might have been an opportunity to 
become one when the show was canceled, said she was "very disappointed," but 
"they've got a business to run. I'm merely a cog." Mason had hired a publicist 
to promote her appearances next week and hoped for a turnout from Hollywood 
casting powers, as well as a visit by her Chicago-based parents, who still 
haven't seen her in the show. They might get another chance when she becomes 
Close's standby on Broadway, where "Sunset" opens Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket holders who showed up at the Shubert box office for refunds Friday 
morning sounded angrier than Mason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot believe that in the United States they can't replace Glenn Close. If 
Michael Crawford can be replaced, Glenn Close can be replaced," declared Joanne 
Matute of Los Angeles, who was trying to exchange a ticket she had bought in 
December for a September performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andrew Lloyd Webber is crazy," said Paisley Yankolovich of Sherman Oaks. 
"Faye Dunaway was my all-time favorite actress. This whole show has had an aura 
of nastiness around it." The reference was to the earlier flap in which LuPone 
was deposed in favor of Close for the Broadway casting. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers at the Century Plaza Hotel, across the street from the theater, 
aren't happy about the turn of events either. The hotel's $300 theater 
packages, which paid for a night at the hotel plus two "Sunset" tickets, were 
booked through July -- 700 packages in all. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Petrus, the hotel's managing director, said he was "shocked by the 
abruptness of it. The plug has been pulled so quickly." Hotel staff is now 
calling those ticket holders and offering complimentary accommodations over the 
dates of their confirmed reservations if they have non-refundable airline 
tickets. Petrus also estimated that the hotel restaurant would lose 150 
customers per night from the show's cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Anne Bergman contributed to this report. Editor's Note 
</P>
<P>
 The theater listings in Sunday Calendar include an entry for "Sunset 
Boulevard." The section was printed before news of the show's cancellation was 
announced Thursday.

RUOTOLO ROLLS 7 TO LEAD SPLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raffaele Ruotolo scored four goals and had three assists to lead the Splash to 
a 9-7 victory over Monterrey on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gives the Splash (6-0) the Continental Indoor Soccer League's best 
record and matches last season's victory total by the franchise, when it was 
the Los Angeles United.It has a 2 1/2-game lead in the Western Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterrey (2-4), with its small field and boisterous fans, was expected to 
provide the Splash with its most difficult challenge on the four-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash took a 4-0 lead before La Raza tied the score, 5-5, early in the 
third quarter. Ruotolo made it 6-5, then assisted Sam George 2 minutes 21 
seconds into the fourth quarter to make it 7-6. Ruotolo provided the margin of 
victory with his fourth goal to put the Splash up, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Valdivia scored twice, and Doug Neely and Rod Castro also scored.

WRIGHT MAY SOON SIGN WITH UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disappointed by what they consider feeble attempts to sign their son, the 
parents of Cleveland Indians' No. 1 draft choice Jaret Wright said the former 
Katella High standout will probably accept a baseball scholarship to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County's 1994 player of the year, Wright, a hard-throwing 
right-handed pitcher, was selected with the 10th overall pick in the June 
free-agent amateur draft. Clyde Wright, Jaret's father and a former Angel 
pitcher, said negotiations have deteriorated to such an extent the parties have 
broken off talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're going to school," Clyde said. "I just see this thing 
dragging on and on." 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde and Vicki Wright want their son, the second high school pitcher chosen, 
to receive a signing bonus comparable to the $1.55-million agreement reached 
between the Yankees and No. 1 pick Brien Taylor in 1991. Sources said the 
Indians offered around $850,000 when Cleveland General Manager John Hart, who 
is handling the negotiations, visited the Wrights on June 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't understand how (Hart) could come to my house and talk about the 
value of my son for two hours, and then come in with such a low figure," Vicki 
said. "It was a little embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 If things hold to form, Clyde said Jaret soon will sign a letter of intent 
with UCLA. He also has a scholarship offer from Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wrights, however, have retained agent Scott Boras as an adviser. Boras, 
known as an extremely tough negotiator, was an adviser to Calvin Murray, the 
Indians' top pick in 1989 -- the last time Cleveland failed to sign its first 
selection. Under NCAA guidelines, Jaret would lose his college eligibility if 
Boras represents him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright (6 feet 2, 220 pounds) was 7-2 with a 2.98 earned-run average during 
the regular season. He led the county in strikeouts with 100 in 75 innings. 
</P>

 Wright, whose fastball has been clocked at more than 95 m.p.h., was reportedly 
tied for the highest rating in the draft by the Major League Scouting Bureau. 
But several teams selecting before the Indians shied away because of the money 
Clyde indicated it would take to sign his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado hoped to take Wright with the seventh pick, but the Rockies' 
draft-day offer of $900,000 was promptly turned down. Since the Indians were 
aware of what had been declined, Clyde cannot understand their thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is frustrating as hell," Clyde said. "Cleveland knew what it was going 
to cost to sign him."

ROGERS' PITCHING KEEPS RANGERS IN THE GAME; BASEBALL: WITH LITTLE SUPPORT, HE 
MANAGES TO GET THROUGH THE ROUGH SPOTS TO BEAT THE ANGELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nobody would blame Texas pitcher Kenny Rogers if he winced when reading the 
box score from Friday night's game against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense? Rogers couldn't get any help from the Ranger shortstops Manny Lee and 
Esteban Beltre, who contributed three errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Run support? The Rangers gave him only two runs, nearly five below their 
average when the left-hander pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 And how about a little help from the Rangers' bullpen, considered the worst in 
the major leagues? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rogers didn't let any of that drag him down Friday night, stopping a 
ninth-inning Angel rally for a 2-1 complete-game victory in front of 35,479 at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a typical Rogers performance this season. He struck out six, walked two 
and didn't allow a runner past second base after the fourth inning. He is 9-4 
this season and his 20 victories since July 6 of last year is the most among 
American League starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to let the league know that I'm a pitcher and not just a thrower 
anymore," Rogers said. "I didn't have good stuff at all early. My curveball was 
no good the first five innings, but it got better as the game went on." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he struggled with that pitch in the bottom of the ninth inning, after 
Chad Curtis doubled down the third-base line with one out. After a curveball to 
the next batter, J.T. Snow, bounced in the dirt, Rogers soon had some company 
on the mound -- Texas Manager Kevin Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me what I was thinking when I bounced that pitch into the dirt," 
Rogers said. "I was just worried about Curtis and not concentrating on the 
batter. I told him I was fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy stuck with Rogers partly because of his durability and toughness late 
in games. He has seven complete games since May 18 and has pitched at least 
seven innings in 10 consecutive starts and 14 of 16 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the other reason Rogers stayed in was an unreliable Ranger bullpen that 
has blown 15 save opportunities this season, the most in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had all of them (relievers) down there warming up," Kennedy said. "Sure, we 
have caved in a couple of times. But we needed Kenny and he rose to the 
occasion for us. I wanted him in there all the way. He was still strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong enough to strike out Snow and then pinch-hitter Harold Reynolds, who 
was seven for 22 lifetime against Rogers. It was Rogers' third strikeout of the 
inning, having caught Bo Jackson swinging to open the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a tough last inning," Rogers said. "But I felt pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers is off to the best start in six major league seasons. He had a six-game 
winning streak -- the longest on the Rangers since Bobby Witt's club-record 12 
in 1990 -- broken last Sunday in a 5-0 loss to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless Rogers goes the route of the Ranger bullpen before July, he's almost a 
lock to make the All-Star team. But Kennedy is already lobbying for his 
left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kenny has pitched some great games for us," Kennedy said. "He has made some 
great strides since June of last year. I would vote for him for the All-Star 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez won't argue with Kennedy's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at his record and you see he's one of the top guys in the league," 
Rodriguez said. "He was really sharp tonight -- a good fastball and good 
location."

MARCACCINI SAYS PEPPERDINE ISN'T A SURE THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Monte Marcaccini, former basketball standout at Notre Dame High, has returned 
to the United States after playing in Italy, but contrary to published reports 
he has not decided to play at Pepperdine next season. 
</P>
<P>
 An area paper reported Tuesday that Marcaccini made an unofficial visit to 
Pepperdine last week and was expected to commit to the school later this month 
after getting a release from his Italian club team. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini, who lived in Italy as a child, played for the past 10 months on an 
Italian junior team. He said he always intended to return to the United States 
after one season. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he was not paid to play in Italy, his NCAA eligibility was unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of tripping when I read that because I never said I was going to 
go there," Marcaccini said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want it to sound like I don't like Pepperdine, because I do, but I 
can't say for sure that that's where I'm going to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini, who signed a letter of intent with Indiana as a high school senior 
before deciding to play in Italy, said Pepperdine's recent hiring of Bob 
Mandeville as an assistant coach was a "big plus" in his eyes.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, that doesn't mean he's headed to the West Coast Conference school. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I go there, he would be one of the reasons why," Marcaccini said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even though he wasn't officially the basketball coach at Notre Dame, I 
learned a lot from him when I was there. I worked with him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandeville, 32, coached lower-level basketball teams at Notre Dame from 
1986-89 and was the Knights' varsity baseball coach from 1987-92.  
</P>
<P>
 He was a restricted earnings assistant basketball coach at San Diego State 
under Tony Fuller during the 1992-94 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fuller was named to replace Tom Asbury at Pepperdine earlier this year -- 
Asbury resigned to take over at Kansas State -- he hired Mandeville to fill the 
Waves' vacant full-time assistant position.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: DWAYNE MURPHY; COMFORT ZONE IS THE END; BASEBALL CAREER 
OVER, HE RETURNS TO HIS FIRST LOVE -- FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a moment no father could forget, and Dwayne Murphy was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 He was just 18, a married man for all of one month to Brenda, his sweetheart 
since junior high. It was May of 1973, and he was cradling his newborn son, 
Dwayne Jr., in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the arrival of young Dwayne came new responsibilities for a guy a 
month shy of graduation from Antelope Valley High. So as Murphy welcomed his 
son into the world and considered his financial obligations as a father, he 
said goodby to football, his favorite sport, spurning a football scholarship to 
Arizona State and signing a professional baseball contract. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a gut-wrenching decision, and little did Murphy know that he would be 
identified as a baseball player thereafter. The Gold Glove center fielder 
played alongside such players as Rickey Henderson, Dave Kingman and Tony Armas 
with the Oakland Athletics in the early 1980s. His highlight-filled major 
league baseball career spanned 12 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Now 39, Murphy is four years removed from his playing days, and has come full 
circle. High school football is at the center of his life again. He is head 
coach at California High in San Ramon, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 His football career had a memorable beginning in Antelope Valley where he 
starred as a running back and defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of him right now, I think about football and I think about him 
hitting guys and their helmets flying off," said Brent Newcomb, who was an 
assistant at Antelope Valley when Murphy played there and is now the head 
coach. "He had tremendous athletic ability on both sides of the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's exploits on the baseball diamond were equally impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember against Burroughs Ridgecrest," said Murphy's younger brother, Rod. 
"Back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs. Four home runs in one game. . . . Even 
an out was a hard hit for him." 
</P>
<P>
 According to former Antelope Valley teammates, Murphy was a driven athlete, a 
leader who encouraged with his actions instead of his words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Captain, we called him," Rod Murphy said from his furniture store in Canoga 
Park. "Nobody talked in the huddle. He did all the talking. On the baseball 
diamond his senior year, I think he won every game for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Hellwig first met Murphy when they played football against each other in 
junior high and eventually became his teammate at Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it came time to play, he seemed to be above everybody," Hellwig said. 
"He seemed to be more focused. When you were playing you could pin it all on 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1, 170-pound player enjoyed the practices and especially the 
hitting. His future was in football, or so he thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a letter from every college there was," Murphy said. "But I never got 
any scholarship offers for baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the A's came calling. The signing bonus? $6,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, back in '73 that wasn't too bad," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, his career wasn't too bad, either. Murphy was a career .246 hitter with 
166 home runs who won six Gold Gloves. In 1982, he led the team with 94 runs 
batted in and also hit 27 homers. Two years later, his 33 homers were third 
best in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 But it hardly came easy at first when he reported to rookie ball as a 
shortstop in the small town of Lewiston, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that he met Steve McCatty, a rookie pitcher who wound up becoming 
his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember he wasn't that great a shortstop," McCatty said. "I won't say that 
he threw balls over the wall and into the stands, but the coaches saw him play 
for a little while and said, 'OK, that's enough. Get in the outfield.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Murphy: "I lasted about 25 minutes as a shortstop." 
</P>
<P>
 He found his true calling in center field, and moved through the organization 
in the next few years. First came two seasons in Class-A ball at Burlington, 
Iowa, and Modesto, Calif., then one season in double-A Chattanooga, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, he was called up to triple-A Tucson, and in 1978 he got his shot with 
the big club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember we opened up in Anaheim in '78 and I was in awe," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCatty soon followed Murphy, arriving in Oakland later that same season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really strange," McCatty said. "Sometimes guys' careers parallel like 
that. It was nice to have somebody to share all that with." 
</P>
<P>
 Both were briefly demoted to the minors before being called up for good in 
1979. Soon thereafter, the A's enjoyed some of their best years under Manager 
Billy Martin. They won the American League West in 1981 before getting swept by 
the New York Yankees in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something you really work for your entire career." Murphy said. "Some 
guys play all those years and never get to see it. You play all those years and 
that's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy enjoyed some of his best years under Martin, the controversial manager 
who helped Murphy refine his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and Billy clicked real well," he said. "He taught me how to run the 
outfield, and I think that's what made our outfield so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Said McCatty: "Billy helped make him a better outfielder and he made me a 
better pitcher. (Murphy) made the plays that made me look so good, as did 
(Henderson) and (Armas). I used to say we should move the wall back so more 
balls would fall in for them to catch." 
</P>
<P>
 The team reached its peak in the early '80s but then its fortunes turned when 
key people left the organization. First went Martin, who was fired following 
the 1982 season. Armas was traded to the Boston Red Sox the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries also began to slow Murphy. In 1986 he ran into the left-field wall at 
Fenway Park, rupturing a disk in his back. In 1987 he underwent knee surgery 
after colliding with Mike Davis in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come off a successful season, you sniff a piece of it, and we never quite 
got back," Murphy said. "The closest I got again was with Detroit in '87, but 
that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 He played sparingly during his last season in the majors, a 98-game stint with 
the Philadelphia Phillies in 1989. In 1990 he played in Japan until a knee 
injury ended his career. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Danville, a suburb of Oakland, to relax before planning his 
next move, but he did not rest long. Murphy was approached by officials from 
California High in neighboring San Ramon to coach their freshman football team 
and he accepted, not because he needed a job.  
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this is just fun," he said. "It's fun working with the kids and it's 
fun teaching them to be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, he was promoted to junior varsity coach, and became the varsity 
coach last year. Although he didn't realize it at the time, he also accepted 
the position of team fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of budget constraints, each player must pay $405 to participate. When 
some players struggled to raise the money, Murphy scrambled for ways to help 
them make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want kids not playing because of money," he said. "I've been going 
around, putting on fund-raisers for the hardship cases, and it's worked out 
real well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something I never thought about. I took the job to coach football, but 
you have to do what you can to make your football program successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy led perennial doormat California High to a 5-5 record in 1993 a year 
after a winless season in '92. The lessons learned on fields in the Antelope 
Valley two decades ago have served him well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football was a big part of my life back (at Antelope Valley)," he said. "I 
felt I was coached well and I learned a lot. I think it's carried over to the 
way I'm coaching now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm satisfied with my baseball career and I'm enjoying what I'm doing right 
now."

NO LONGER A BOY, MANN OVERPOWERS BORENSTEIN; JUNIOR TENNIS: HE TURNS THE TABLES 
ON FORMER NEMESIS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SECTIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Scott Borenstein was longing for the good old days Friday. He was thinking of 
how he used to push Dylan Mann around on a tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 Those days certainly seemed long ago when Borenstein of Santa Monica was 
routed by his friend from Canoga Park, 6-2, 6-1, in a quarterfinal singles 
match in the Southern California Junior Sectional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed, and so has Mann, the third-seeded player who advanced to 
today's boys' 16-and-under division semifinals at Los Caballeros Sports 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, 15, is almost nine months younger than Borenstein, who turned 16 in 
January. Borenstein once used the age difference to his advantage. Not anymore. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Borenstein stands 5 feet 7 1/2 and weighs 120 pounds. Mann has shot up to 6-1, 
160. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to kill me," Mann said. "He would just beat up on me when we were 
smaller. But I grew up and he pretty much stayed the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann and Borenstein, who were doubles teammates in 1990, hadn't faced each 
other in singles in three years.  
</P>
<P>
 Mann did the bullying Friday, with a serve-and-volley attack that overpowered 
Borenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann broke Borenstein's serve all four times in the second set with hard 
returns to the corners and slashing volleys that kept Borenstein on the 
defensive when it was supposed to be his turn to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Borenstein could only shrug at the irony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to beat (Mann) almost every time we played," he said. "He used to not 
volley that well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was expecting a lot of what happened. I knew he was going to attack my 
backhand. I just couldn't put it together. I had my chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Borenstein battled Mann to deuce in each of the first three games of the first 
set. But he lost all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made him miss a couple passing shots by coming to the net," Mann said. 
"That set the tempo." 
</P>
<P>
 By the second set, Borenstein often appeared helpless. Everything he hit was 
coming back hard and deep or slicing at sharp angles. 
</P>
<P>
 The set opened with three consecutive breaks, the last one coming on Mann's 
crossing forehand volley. Mann then held serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Down, 3-1, and desperately needing to hold serve, Borenstein was frozen when 
Mann hit a screamer past him to break and lead, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nice shot," Borenstein would often say, after a grunt, a moan or a groan. 
</P>
<P>
 So dominant was Mann that at one point in the second set he fell behind, 
love-40, while serving but won five consecutive points to hold.  
</P>
<P>
 Borenstein was so flustered by the end of it, he double-faulted on match 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure his size helps him on the serve and his long legs help him get to 
the net," Borenstein said. "No way I can serve and volley right now. I haven't 
grown yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann will face top-seeded Joseph Gilbert of Fullerton in the semifinals today 
at noon.  
</P>
<P>
 Mann is 0-2 against Gilbert, who beat No. 6 Robert Williams of Los Angeles, 
6-4, 6-4, to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, Williams (Dorsey High) beat Mann (Taft) in a three-set, 
two-tiebreaker match for the City Section singles championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In boys' 18 singles, second-seeded Derek Pope of Ojai beat No. 6 Vo Chu of San 
Diego, 6-3, 1-6, 6-0.  
</P>
<P>
 Pope will face third-seeded Philip Tseng of Los Angeles and Harvard-Westlake 
High in today's semifinals. Tseng defeated David Chang of Diamond Bar, 6-2, 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In girls' 18 singles, top-seeded Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks breezed past 
Romy Mehlman of Beverly Hills and Harvard-Westlake High, 6-1, 6-0.  
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski will face No. 7 Tu Dong of Long Beach in the semifinals today. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Krissy Hamilton of Agoura Hills defaulted her quarterfinal match 
to No. 6 Rosemary She of Cerritos because of a foot injury. No. 4 Violette Ahn 
of Los Angeles defeated unseeded Monique Allegre of Camarillo, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 In girls' 16 singles, top-seeded Alexandra Stevenson of San Diego downed No. 5 
Jessica Kessler of Studio City , 7-5, 6-3, Amy Wax of San Diego beat No. 6 
Kirsten Gross of Calabasas, 6-3, 6-7 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5), and No. 4 Mugette Ahn 
(Los Angeles) defeated No. 7 Brandis Braverman of Encino, 6-2, 6-3.

REBOUND OF MANDEVILLE; BASKETBALL COACH WAVES GOODBY TO BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Mandeville would like to set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was a shortstop in the Chicago Cubs' organization for 2 1/2 
seasons and the varsity baseball coach at Notre Dame High from 1987-92, his 
affection for basketball always has rivaled his interest in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when an assistant coaching position in San Diego State's basketball 
program opened two years ago, he bravely applied. 
</P>
<P>
 The basketball portion of his resume was a little thin: only three seasons as 
a high school basketball coach -- none at the varsity level. 
</P>
<P>
 But San Diego State assistant Jim Harrick Jr., the son of UCLA Coach Jim 
Harrick and a long-time friend of Mandeville, persuaded Coach Tony Fuller to 
grant Mandeville an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 That was just the opening Mandeville required. He so impressed Fuller during 
the interview, he wound up making a radical career change.  
</P>
<P>
 He became San Diego State's new restrictive earnings basketball assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought (Bob) was very intelligent and very bright," Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fuller replaced Tom Asbury at Pepperdine earlier this year -- Asbury 
resigned to take over at Kansas State -- he filled the Waves' vacant full-time 
assistant position with the 32-year-old Mandeville. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always enjoyed both sports, whether playing or coaching, equally well," 
Mandeville said. "I think there's a little bit more excitement involved in 
coaching basketball than baseball, but I enjoy them both." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, an assistant at Pepperdine from 1982-88 and at UCLA from 1989-92, has 
no regrets about taking a chance on Mandeville at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected a lot out of him, but he was a pleasant surprise," Fuller said. 
"He's very dependable and very loyal and those are qualities you want in an 
assistant coach. You want to know that when you need something to get done, 
it's going to get done right the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictive earnings position -- which by NCAA rules pays a maximum of 
$16,500 a year -- was a step back for Mandeville financially, but the 1980 
graduate of Notre Dame High figured that the long-term benefits outweighed the 
short-term loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a great career opportunity," Mandeville said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tony was a young, dynamic coach who wasn't too set in his ways, so I figured 
I'd get along with him. . . . I always liked the San Diego area, but in this 
profession, you can't be too set about where you want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to go where the opportunities are." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his job description has changed and he will be more involved with 
recruiting at Pepperdine than he was at San Diego State, Mandeville doesn't 
expect his workload to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 As he points out, his pay might have been restricted at San Diego State, but 
his hours were not. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three assistants worked hard," Mandeville said. "It didn't matter if you 
were a full-time or a restricted earnings coach, you worked hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Mandeville is complaining. He realized that accepting a restricted 
earnings position was a way of "paying your dues" at the Division I level and 
he was pleasantly surprised that his apprenticeship lasted only two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, this has happened a lot quicker than I thought it would," he said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you go into jobs with specific goals in mind, but it's real hard to 
set definite timetables in this line of work. You just never know when things 
are going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandeville's first step up the Division I coaching ladder means he's a step 
further away from a baseball coaching career that appeared to be his calling a 
few years ago. After excelling at Notre Dame as a player in both baseball -- he 
was an All-Southern Section 4-A Division selection as a senior -- and 
basketball -- he was a second-team All-Del Rey League selection three times -- 
Mandeville was recruited by several Pacific 10 Conference schools in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a desire to play both sports led him to Whitworth College, an NAIA 
school in Spokane, Wash., where he majored in business administration. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating in 1984, Mandeville played minor league baseball for 2 1/2 
years before returning to Notre Dame in the fall of 1986 as the varsity 
baseball coach and sophomore basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Mandeville, the baseball team compiled a 109-55-4 record and was 
consistently one of the top teams in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has been following the collegiate and professional baseball 
careers of his former players and looking forward to attending some Pepperdine 
baseball games next season, Mandeville has little desire to return to the 
diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very content and very happy with where I am now," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have aspirations to be a head Division I hoops coach one day, but for the 
next five years I just want to work with Tony and help make this university one 
of the top programs on the West Coast."

LADIN FIRES A FINAL 78, FALLS BACK; SENIOR GOLF: TWO SHOTS OFF THE LEAD, HE 
BLOWS UP AND FINISHES IN A TIE FOR SIXTH IN STATE AMATEUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Paul Ladin drew back his putter on his penultimate putt in the third State 
Senior Amateur Championship, his hat blew off and tumbled across the 18th 
green. 
</P>
<P>
 At least his ball got closer to the hole than did the hat, someone in the 
gallery cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a particularly humorous remark at the time, since Ladin's score had blown 
sky high, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin, who started the day only two shots off the lead, fired a disappointing 
final-round 78 at Poppy Hills Golf Course Friday and finished in a five-way tie 
for sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin, the defending champion, was never really in the running. His game was 
never off and running, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aw, I was terrible," said Ladin, 61. "I never got anything going." 
</P>
<P>
 Which meant he was going, going, gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McMurtrey of Danville won with a final-round 72 to finish at 218, three 
shots ahead of Ed Rieu of Bermuda Dunes. Ladin finished at 226. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin, who finished fifth in the event's inaugural year, needed to make a big 
move on the leaders over the back nine. Instead, he moved backward through the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to press it," Ladin said. "But that don't work well here." 
</P>
<P>
 The beginning of the end came on the 14th hole, a 392-yard par four. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin took out his driver, given to him by golfing and fishing buddy George 
Archer. It was time to fish or cut bait, so Ladin tried to cut the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he hit the ball into a stand of trees and was forced to take a 
one-shot penalty for an unplayable lie. He finished with a double bogey on the 
hole and dropped five shots behind Rieu, his playing partner, and seven behind 
McMurtrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin shot 40 on the back nine and spent most of the round trying to salvage 
par, which isn't exactly the best way to gain ground. Rieu, for example, had 
six birdies on Friday alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a dog chasing cars," Ladin said of his scrambling round. "Sooner or 
later, you get run over." 
</P>
<P>
 His luck ran bad early. Ladin, who owns an auto dealership in Thousand Oaks, 
three-putted the first hole for bogey. It was a week of missed opportunities. 
He managed just two birdies in 54 holes, none in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
 He three-putted the 13th hole for bogey moments before his errant tee shot at 
No. 14 ended any chance at victory. "The putting's just not there,' he said. "I 
didn't find (my stroke) until it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
 The only good news for Ladin, who lives in Westlake Village, was that he 
finished in the top seven, earning an automatic exemption for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtrey, who led from wire to wire, outlasted Rieu, who closed to within a 
shot on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtrey, playing one foursome behind Ladin and Rieu, pulled off the shot of 
the day on the par-three 15th. Rieu, 55, had just birdied the hole to move to 
within one shot, and McMurtrey's tee shot found a greenside bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ball above his feet on a side-hill lie, McMurtrey, 61, hit the 
flagstick and nearly holed the shot from 50 feet to save par and his one-stroke 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rieu made a triple bogey on the par-three 17th -- he skulled a bunker shot 
into the Del Monte Forest -- to end the drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Chirpich, 57, of Granada Hills shot 77 and finished 21st at 232. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo's Chuck Wagner, 60, shot 86 and finished 28th at 241 -- last among 
those who made the 54-hole cut.

BUYUKUNCU SETS RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine Novaquatics Coach Dave Salo told Derya Buyukuncu that if New York lost 
the NBA championship series, he would owe Buyukuncu $50. But if the Knicks won, 
the Turkish Olympian would owe him a 2:01 in the 200-meter backstroke at the 
Swim Meet of Champions. That was two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Salo is out $50, but he did get from Buyukuncu a performance of 2 minutes 
01.77 seconds in the event, good enough for a meet record Friday, the second 
day of competition at the Marguerite Aquatics Complex. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's preliminaries, Buyukuncu had the second-fastest time behind 
Stanford's Jeff Rouse. But Buyukuncu said he was holding back, saving his best 
for the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to swim as fast as I could go and get the meet record," 
Buyukuncu said. "But I mean, I was up against Rouse. He has the world record in 
the 100 back. But I didn't want that to interfere with my race." 
</P>
<P>
 Buyukuncu's swim shattered the mark of 2:15.32, set by Royce Sharp of 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his 200 back victory, Buyukuncu, who was The Times Orange 
County swimmer of the year, took first in the 100-meter freestyle (51.60), 
defeating Steve Vandermeulen of the University of Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 To no one's surprise, Janet Evans won the 400 freestyle (4:13.24), swimming 
seven seconds faster than her time in the preliminaries, and finishing 10 
seconds ahead of runner-up Lisa Jacob. Chad Carvin won the men's event in 
3:57.47. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Murphy, 16, of Mission Viejo High and the Nadodores, was able to hold 
on to defeat Kathy Monar of the University of Calgary in the 200 backstroke, 
posting a 2:19.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Ugar Tanner of the Chinook Swim Club won the men's 200-meter butterfly in 
2:03.69. Angie Wester-Krieg of Stanford won the women's event in 2:13.61. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's 400-meter freestyle relay, the Trojan Swim Club just touched 
out Stanford in 3:56.56. Stanford's men defeated Calgary by a second, posting a 
3:31.17. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition resumes at 9 a.m. today with finals scheduled to begin at 5 p.m.

U.S. CONTROLS CUBA EARLY FOR WATER POLO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two easy victories against weaker opponents at the Alamo Cup, the U.S. 
national water polo team had a tougher challenge Friday night at Corona del Mar 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba, a strong, dangerous team, stood between the United States and an 
undefeated record in pool play, but the U.S. team took control of the match 
early and held on to win, 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, two-time defending Alamo Cup champion, will play Australia 
in a semifinal match at 6:15 p.m. today. Hungary, which beat Australia, 9-8, to 
win the other pool Friday, will play Cuba in the other semifinal at 5. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 17-8 victory over Japan earlier Friday, which followed the opening 
14-1 rout of Mexico Thursday, the U.S. team was bound to have a tougher time 
against Cuba, a powerful team that plays well in streaks. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Rich Corso said it was important to start quickly against Cuba. 
"It's really hard to come back against the Cubans once they establish their 
rhythm," Corso said. 
</P>
<P>
 His team followed the game plan perfectly, making its first four shots of the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Everist and Alex Rousseau each scored twice and the United States led, 
4-0, less than three minutes into the match. 
</P>
<P>
 From then on, the teams played fairly evenly. The United States led by as many 
as five goals several times, and Cuba cut the lead to three with 4 minutes 18 
seconds left in the fourth quarter but never really got back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Everist and Rousseau each finished with three goals and Alex Asta and Troy 
Barnhart had two for the U.S. team. Pedro Biart scored five for Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba's Ivan Perez, one of the top two-meter players in the world, presented 
problems. The U.S. two-meter defenders were ejected nine times, leading to many 
of Cuba's six man-advantage goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of those ejections were charged to Villa Park graduates. Doug Kimbell, 
the U.S. team's primary two-meter defender, received his third early in the 
fourth quarter, disqualifying him from the rest of the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Gavin Arroyo received two ejections and was guarding Perez when he scored his 
only goal to make it 11-7 late in the third quarter. On the play, Perez took a 
pass in the hole with Arroyo, who finished his career at California last fall, 
on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a thick 230 pounds; I'm a rather lanky 185," Arroyo said. "All I 
remember was holding his shooting arm with both of my arms." 
</P>
<P>
 All that was visible above the water was Perez's arm and the ball, soon to be 
past goalkeeper Chris Duplanty and in the back of the net.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. B team, which lost to Australia, 11-6, and beat Canada, 12-8, Friday, 
will play Mexico in today's first match at 2:30 p.m. Canada and Japan will play 
at 3:45.

TRACK AND FIELD / JOHN ORTEGA; LIPKIS DIALS LONG DISTANCE FOR SPRINTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roger Lipkis, a coach for the West Valley Eagles Track Club, has again 
assembled a superb group of sprinters for the summer track season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the club is based in Canoga Park, the Eagles' roster includes 
athletes from around the Southland who accounted for four individual state 
championships earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Russell of Rowland High, Pat Johnson of Redlands, Tyree Washington of La 
Sierra in Riverside and Bryan Howard of Canyon Springs in Moreno Valley teamed 
up to win the 400-meter relay in 40.55 seconds in the National Scholastic 
Outdoor championships at North Carolina State on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, Johnson, Russell and Michael Granville of Bell Gardens timed a 
victorious 3 minutes 7.67 seconds in the 1,600 relay. 
</P>
<P>
 As scintillating as those times are, Lipkis says West Valley is capable of 
running faster, and it's hard to doubt him. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who is headed to Oregon, won the 100 and 200 in the state 
championships earlier this month, and Russell, a junior, finished second in the 
400. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington won the long jump in the state meet, Howard finished second in the 
200 -- he was disqualified from the 100 for a false start -- and sophomore 
Granville was the state champion in the 800. Washington and Howard are between 
their junior and senior years. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville, the team's top 400 sprinter, is not expected to race any more this 
summer, but with Howard (personal best of 48.44 in the 400) and Lamar Reed 
(47.88) of Morningside at his disposal, Lipkis is not worried about a 
significant drop-off in performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal for the year is to go (mid-39s) in the 400 relay and 3:06 in the 
1,600," Lipkis said. "I think that's possible based on what I saw the other 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add relays: The 3:07.67 clocking in the 1,600 relay is a club record for West 
Valley, but the 40.55 effort in the 400 trails the mark of 40.08 set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 That team consisted of Quincy Watts and David Feinstein of Taft High, Bryan 
Bridgewater of Washington and Percy Knox of Antelope Valley. Watts won the 400 
in the 1992 Olympic Games, and Bridgewater (200) and Knox (long jump) were high 
school state champions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia question: What local high school coach placed second in the 440-yard 
dash in the 1957 state high school championships? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Triple crown: Jeremy Fischer's victory in the high jump in the National 
Scholastic championships made the Camarillo High senior one of only three 
athletes this year to win titles in that meet as well as the California state 
championships and the Golden West Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are Pat Johnson, who won the 200 in each meet, and Mebrathom 
Keflezighi of San Diego, who was victorious in the 1,600 meters or mile in each 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Medical report: Kristin Dunn of Cal State Northridge, who finished third in 
the women's javelin in the NCAA championships earlier this month, underwent 
surgery last week to remove bone chips from her left knee and to repair a torn 
patella tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn, second on the all-time Northridge list with a personal best of 174-9 in 
the javelin, is expected to resume training in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bypassing surgery: Mike Esparza, runner-up in the 3,000-meter steeplechase for 
Moorpark College in last month's Southern California championships, has decided 
against surgery on a torn tendon in the second toe of his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Esparza severed the tendon when he hit his foot on a steeplechase barrier in 
the Southern California preliminaries May 7. He expected to have it operated on 
after the season, but questions about the surgery's effectiveness and financial 
considerations prompted his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctors told me that there was only about a 50-50 chance that it would be 
totally successful," he said. "I'm happy with the decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The only time he doubts his decision is when he's surfing. He occasionally 
bangs his toe -- which points downward because of the injury -- on the edge of 
the board as he stands up. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear some pretty loud screams out in the waves every now and then, but 
other than that it's fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running on empty: John Frazier said he didn't want to resign from his 
assistant coaching position at Cal State Northridge earlier this month, but 
felt that circumstances forced his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Frazier was paid a full-time salary during his three years at 
Northridge, three-quarters of it was for his position with the university 
recruitment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, a typical work day would find Frazier recruiting students for 
the university during the morning and early afternoon before heading directly 
to practice.

 "With the set-up the way it was, I just felt like I was spreading myself too 
thin," Frazier said. "That's why I resigned." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Frazier's position with the university recruitment program could 
become full-time in the fall, he ultimately wants to become a full-time 
athletic administrator or coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to gain full-time employment within an athletic department, and I 
just didn't see that happening at Northridge," he said.

ANDERSON IS HONORED BY EDITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Anderson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning sports columnist for the New York 
Times, received the Red Smith Award on Friday at the Associated Press Sports 
Editors Convention, but Anderson preferred to talk more about the man for whom 
the award is named than about himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put Red Smith in the same class with all the great American writers," 
Anderson said. "Red did his art form as well as Hemingway did his. . . . But he 
always wanted to be referred to as 'a newspaper stiff.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Smith Award is presented by the editors to a writer who has made a 
major contribution to sports journalism. Smith was honored with the first award 
in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson recalled buying the New York Herald-Tribune to read Smith's column 
when he took the subway from Brooklyn to school. Anderson joined Smith and 
Arthur Daley as sports columnists for the New York Times in 1971, and Anderson 
received the Pulitzer Prize for commentary a decade later. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about Anderson on Friday was left to others, including Los Angeles Times 
columnist Jim Murray, recipient of the Red Smith Award the second year it was 
presented and a Pulitzer Prize winner. Murray sent a personal message. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us who have won the Red Smith Award move up a couple of lengths today 
with the inclusion of Dave Anderson," Murray wrote. "Dave is, and always has 
been, a stakes horse. Our profession is lucky to have him. He's always been 
fair, cheerful, honest, and no more respected person ever walked into a locker 
room -- or a press room. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows what he says matters, and he is scrupulous about saying it right. 
I'm proud to be in the same business. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Amdur, sports editor of the New York Times, praised Anderson as a "team 
player" and as "a positive, upbeat kind of person" in addition to his 
well-known writing ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Dave still loves that competition . . .," Amdur said. "He still can break 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Smith, the chairman of the APSE selection board and the deputy managing 
editor of the Dallas Morning News, said, "The one word that goes with this 
award is class , and that's true again with this year's award winner."

WOODS UPSET IN SEMIFINALS OF STATE AMATEUR GOLF PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Temecula's Ed Cuff provided the biggest surprise of the 83rd California Golf 
Assn.'s State Amateur Championship when he defeated Tiger Woods of Cypress in 
the semifinal round Friday at Pebble Beach Golf Links. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuff, who needed 20 holes in the morning round to get past Goleta's Kevin 
Marsh, beat Woods, the three-time USGA Junior Amateur champ, 2 and 1, to earn a 
spot in today's 36-hole final. 
</P>
<P>
 He will go against medalist Steve Woods, who also won two matches, the second 
against Rocklin's Steve Burdick, 2-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuff, 32, was the oldest of the four semifinalists. He failed to yield to the 
pressure of Woods, 18, who fired a 2-under-par 34 on the front nine but was 
only 1-up.  
</P>
<P>
 Woods went 2-up with a par at the 10th but lost the 11th. Cuff evened the 
match with a 15-foot birdie putt on the 13th. He went 1-up for the first time 
in the match with a 10-foot birdie putt at the 15th. Then, Woods three-putted 
the 16th and lost to a par. Both players parred the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Woods, 22, was 1-down to Burdick after nine holes. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin was the same until Woods was conceded a birdie on the 16th hole to 
even the match. Woods then birdied the 17th with a 25-foot putt to go 1-up. He 
secured the victory with a birdie on the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 In other morning matches, Steve Woods defeated Helendale's Mark Johnson, 1-up. 
Burdick, playing 2-under-par golf, tripped Solana Beach's Tim Hart, 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Woods fired a 3-under-par 33 on the front nine to build a 4-up lead and 
defeated Solana Beach's Todd Andrews, 2 and 1.

BLAZE BRIEFLY STIRS MEMORIES OF ORTEGA FIRE; FIREFIGHTING: THE COUNTY'S NEW 
HELICOPTER HELPS PUT OUT FLAMES THAT THREATEN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A helicopter that the county leased earlier this week to help battle wildfires 
got its first real test Friday when it was called upon to aid firefighters in 
quelling a 750-acre blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though fire personnel had not yet finished training on the helicopter, 
the chopper quickly became part of a task force that responded to the fire, 
which burned within 150 feet of an expensive tract of homes in northeast San 
Juan Capistrano before firefighters, with the help of 15 m.p.h. winds, changed 
its direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire charred some 750 acres of grassland before it was declared 
extinguished shortly after 6 p.m., said Capt. Dan Young of the Orange County 
Fire Department. Firefighters were expected to patrol the area over the weekend 
to extinguish any flare-ups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire had threatened about 40 homes off Rancho Viejo Road, between Avery 
Parkway and Junipero Serra Road, but firefighters were able to stop its 
advance. No structures were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators have not determined what caused the blaze, but Young said 
it appeared to have been started by a person. Pointing to a blackened section 
of hill where the fire reportedly started, Young said, "There's no reason for a 
fire to start there. There's nothing mechanical on that spot" that could have 
ignited the vegetation. "It was probably human-caused." 
</P>
<P>
 For residents, the fire brought back the terror of last October's Ortega fire, 
which blackened almost 20,000 acres before being extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very frightening," said Marjorie Frost, who watched flames consume a 
hill from the patio of her home on Horseshoe Bend. "I had my cats in a carrier 
and I was ready to dash at a moment's notice if the wind changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ortega fire prompted the digging of large fire breaks around the 
residential tract. In many places, Friday's blaze burned to the cleared band of 
earth and stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year they didn't disc this area at all," said Barbara Cotter, who called 
Friday's blaze more frightening than the Ortega fire, which was stopped several 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one we could see," she said. "It scared me half to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the burned hillside is part of the Rancho Mission Viejo, a 40,000-acre 
cattle ranch owned by the Santa Margarita Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters had just begun their first week of training on the county's new 
firefighting helicopter when the first report of the blaze was called in just 
before noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a few problems coordinating the helicopter with ground crews because 
of our unfamiliarity with the equipment," county Fire Chief Rich Wiseman said. 
"But overall, we're very pleased with how it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter was leased by the county in response to last year's Ortega and 
Laguna Beach blazes, which officials said illustrated the need for quick 
reaction to fast-moving fires driven by high winds. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter, a Bell model 205A-1 Huey, can carry 360 gallons of water and 
can reload its tanks in about 50 seconds while in the air, using a hose and 
pump. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Bell helicopter, two airplanes and one other small 
helicopter were used to fight Friday's blaze. Also involved were several 
bulldozers and about 120 firefighters and prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiseman said a textbook example of fire preparation stopped the fire from 
damaging homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you'll look around, you'll see the area went through weed abatement, 
removing potential fuel for the fire," he said. "Fire-resistant plants have 
been planted throughout this neighborhood."

TEEN KILLS GIRLFRIEND, 14, THEN HIMSELF 
</P>

<P>
 A teen-ager shot and killed his pregnant, 14-year-old girlfriend Friday night 
and moments later shot himself to death, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 The shootings occurred just before 7:45 p.m. in the 3300 block of South Park 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Vargas and the 16-year-old boy had been dating since the beginning of the 
year, and she was three months' pregnant with his child, her sister Betty 
Vargas, 18, said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his temper, Rosa Vargas heeded her mother's advice and broke up 
with the boy a week ago, Betty Vargas said.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, the boy and a friend arrived on their bicycles at Rosa's 
house to return some of her belongings and to get his belongings from her, the 
sister said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was drunk," said Rosa's brother Frank, 20. "He was always drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 As they all stood on the front yard, he asked Rosa if the baby was his, Betty 
Vargas said. Her mother responded that he need not worry about it. At that 
point, Vargas said, he pulled a gun and shot at the mother, putting a bullet in 
the wall.  
</P>
<P>
 She ran inside, and he began shooting at Rosa, hitting her in the arm and 
neck, Vargas said. She staggered to the door and collapsed and died just 
outside of it. 
</P>
<P>
 He then ran down the street, stopping a few houses away and shooting himself 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not released the boy's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was looking forward to having her baby," Vargas said. "Rosa was a sweet 
girl with long hair down to her back. I can't believe he killed my sister." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa was a freshman at Saddleback High School. The shooter went to Horizon 
High School, Vargas said.

PICKUP TEST DRIVE TAKES A BAD TURN INTO A HIJACKING; CRIME: TWO MEN POSING AS 
POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS FORCE A SALESMAN FOR A WESTMINSTER CAR DEALER TO TURN OVER 
THE $28,000 TRUCK AT GUNPOINT AND SPEED OFF. 
</P>

<P>
 When auto salesman Tony Armstrong took his first customer out for a test drive 
Friday morning, he asked if he could "frisk" the man before they drove off. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong was kidding, but who could blame him?  
</P>
<P>
 The night before, the 48-year-old native of Great Britain survived a 
frightening ordeal during which two men, posing as potential buyers, took him 
on a 30-minute test drive in a new truck, then ordered him out of the vehicle 
at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a little sojourn," Armstrong said. "They pulled into a dark 
alley, pointed the gun at me and said, 'Get out.' I'm an obliging kind of 
fellow, so I got out." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong, who moved to Orange County seven years ago, said salespeople at the 
Mike McCarthy Buick-Subaru-GMC dealership where he works are trained not to 
take risks in this type of situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trained to just give them (the vehicle), but I always thought, 'No 
way, I'll wrestle them to the ground,' and all this brave stuff. But when the 
moment came, I thought better of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although only two men went on the test drive with Armstrong, a third man 
arrived with them at the dealership and appeared to be involved in the 
execution of the crime, which Armstrong and police said seemed to have been 
well-planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men initially came to the dealership on Wednesday and told Armstrong 
that they wanted to test drive a truck. But the business was about to close so 
they were told to come back the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed like nice guys. They made an appointment and came back," 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 While on the drive, the men insisted on taking the vehicle on the freeway. 
After driving about 35 miles on the San Diego, Riverside and Santa Ana 
freeways, Armstrong said he became concerned and told the men that they would 
have to return to the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said we've got to stop this truck and take it back," Armstrong said. "He 
pulled off and next thing I know, the guy in the back seat is pointing a gun at 
me. I asked him, 'What are you going to do? Shoot me?' And he said, 'No, you're 
a nice guy.' 
</P>
<P>
 "After I got out, one of the guys said, 'Sorry dude,' then they drove off." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects escaped with a bright teal-colored 271 Sierra GMC truck. The 
truck, worth about $28,000, can be used as an off-road vehicle. It has an 
extended cab and the body of the truck is lifted high above the wheels. It has 
black paper license plates with the dealership's name on it, said Tom Ramstead, 
owner of the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not going to be able to drive around in that truck and not be 
recognized," Ramstead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong was left stranded near Orangethorpe Avenue and Lemon Street in 
Anaheim. He called police and officers gave him a lift back to the dealership, 
located in the 15000 block of Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Police described the robbers as a 25-year-old white male with blond hair 
shaved on both sides, 6 feet, 2 inches tall and 160 pounds and a 25-year-old 
Latino male with a shaved head, 200 pounds, 5-feet-9. The third man was 
described only as a 25-year-old, 5-feet-10 and 200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong said he is taking the ordeal in stride, but he added: "I don't know 
what the world is coming to anymore. I didn't get shot, so I'm probably lucky. 
There are plenty of people out there who are getting shot. It's a war."

2ND WATER OFFICIAL TO PAY FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita Water District's chief engineer became the second official 
punished over conflict-of-interest allegations when he agreed Friday to pay a 
$10,000 fine to settle a civil lawsuit filed by the Orange County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 William B. Dye, 58, the district's head engineer for the past 15 years, agreed 
to pay the fine and settle the complaint that charged him with six civil 
violations of the state's Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint alleges that between 1990 and 1992, Dye failed to disclose about 
$5,000 in gifts he received from two companies that did the bulk of the 
district's engineering work. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye played a role in awarding contracts to those companies. But state law 
requires officials to abstain from influencing any action that could benefit a 
donor that gives them gifts worth than $250 in value in any 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Dye paid a fine that was twice the amount of gifts he received and we 
think that's substantial," said Marc Kelly, the deputy district attorney who is 
handling the cases against four Santa Margarita Water District officials 
involved in a scandal that broke last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no evidence of criminal intent. Mr. Dye was not living the high 
life, riding in limos or going on trips. But he still got quite a lot of meals 
and we felt it was appropriate to file the civil lawsuit against him," Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit and fine against Dye mirrors similar action taken Wednesday 
against Don B. Schone, the district's former chairman. Schone agreed to pay the 
$10,000 fine after prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit charging him with 
infractions similar to those Dye faced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported in January that Dye and his chief assistant, Dan Ferons, 
had been treated to hundreds of meals and at least two hotel stays in resort 
towns by the Irvine-based engineering firm of Robert Bein, William Frost & 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office said Friday that the civil lawsuit also 
embraced actions Dye took on behalf of a second engineering firm, 
MacDonald-Stephens Engineers in Mission Viejo, which also lavished gifts on 
Santa Margarita officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferons is not under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Dye amended his financial disclosure forms in March and listed $6,068 in 
meals and entertainment from the two firms, he had never disclosed a gift on 
the statements of economic interest he has been required to file annually with 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the amended filing, Dye said he had never listed gifts on his 
statements because he misunderstood the laws governing such filings and had not 
received proper guidance. He said his statements were filed "in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Dye nor his attorney, James A. Stotler, returned calls for comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye's boss, John J. Schatz, the current general manager of the district, said 
Dye would be taking early retirement within the next month, but that the 
decision had nothing to do with his involvement in the scandal. As part of his 
retirement, Dye will get two extra years of service added to his pension. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you're under a cloud like this, it's a serious situation. But I'm 
glad for him and for the district that this had been resolved," Schatz said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the cases against Dye and Schone completed, prosecutors can now turn 
their attention to resolving the criminal cases against former general manager 
Walter W. (Bill) Knitz and his top assistant, Michael P. Lord. Together, they 
are charged with 38 criminal counts stemming from their failure to disclose the 
gifts, trips and meals they received from firms they recommended for contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Knitz and Lord received about $60,000 in gifts -- including extensive 
travel and entertainment from Bein-Frost, MacDonald-Stephens and others, and 
then recommended they receive contracts totaling millions of dollars -- 
prosecutors believe their cases are more serious, and of a criminal nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dye and Schone were clearly on a different level," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is likely that the cases against Knitz and Lord could be resolved next 
week. Kelly is working out plea bargains with both men that would require them 
to pay fines and perform community service. Knitz is scheduled for a hearing 
Monday in South County Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel. Lord's hearing is 
scheduled for Thursday.

LAWSUIT DIMS FUTURE; FLASHLIGHT MAGNATE TALKS ABOUT REGRETS, UNCERTAINTY HE 
FACES IN WAKE OF $84-MILLION PALIMONY CASE HE LOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The millionaire businessman who lost the largest palimony suit in legal 
history talked Friday for the first time since the verdict about the impact the 
$84-million judgment is having on his life and his businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 63-year-old Anthony Maglica says he continues to be mystified by the 
verdict, he insists that he harbors no animosity toward his former companion of 
23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She helped me a little bit with English, but I have no problem now even 
without that. I manage. And business has increased," Maglica said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury last month found in favor of Claire 
Maglica, 60, the executive vice president of Mag Instrument Inc. and Anthony's 
longtime companion. When their relationship became troubled, she filed suit, 
seeking half of the $400 million she said the company was worth. She also 
alleged they built the company together from a hole-in-the wall machine shop 
and that she had promised to share everything with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the pair were known by politicians and socialites as married, they 
never did. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in sneakers, faded jeans and a spotless cotton shirt, Anthony Maglica 
proudly showed off the 11-building Ontario plant Friday that he said he knows 
"in his dreams" by every lathe and screw -- the business he said he poured 
years of work into and lives in fear of losing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the verdict came in, I wasn't thinking about the money. All I was 
thinking was, 'Oh, no. Here I have to do it all over again. All the blood went 
out of my face. It drained out and went down to my feet." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Claire is nowhere to be seen at the Ontario plant. Anthony said he 
has not changed the locks on Mag's doors or at the Anaheim Hills home where he 
now lives with the blinded Bosnian boy the Maglicas rescued from the war zone 
last year, and the boy's mother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jury ruled that Claire and Anthony had no oral agreement to share 
everything, as Claire contended they did, it found that he nevertheless had 
breached his financial duty to her and had failed to compensate her for her 
years at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The $84-million award is the largest of its kind in the nation and probably 
the world, legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica's attorneys are appealing and filed new trial motions Friday. 
They will be back in court by late July, said John W. Keker, Claire Maglica's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 She has declined interviews on Keker's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony said Friday that he sends Claire a regular paycheck, "just like what 
she was making before," and insists he harbors no ill will toward her.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I wanted to, I could make her so miserable, but I haven't done that. Her 
clothes are still in the house," Maglica said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Claire's son and son-in-law have quit their jobs at Mag since the 
trial ended, he said he still sees them from time to time.  
</P>
<P>
 "I still help them. I still make sure they have groceries every week," Maglica 
said. "My attorney says, 'Cut them off,' but I just can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal proceedings have put his dream of expanding the company on hold, 
Maglica said. Those 30 acres sit empty near the Ontario flashlight complex, 
which "makes me feel like hell," he said. "I can't even believe it's happening. 
It just can't be."  
</P>
<P>
 Maglica said he needs to keep $126 million in the bank to cover the 
$84-million judgment against him, so the new 600,000 square-foot plant, 
complete with day care for his 600 workers, will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "This litigation might take five years, 10 years before it's settled, and I 
don't have that many years," Maglica said, as he surveyed a warehouse cramped 
full of inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is why I'm angry more than anything," he said. "This litigation has kept 
me from being efficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica insists, as he did before an Orange County Superior Court jury 
and thousands of Courtroom TV watchers across the country, that he did nothing 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these years, the reason I didn't want to get married was because I didn't 
want to lose control. I didn't want this to happen," he said, recalling the 
bitter fights with his first and only wife, who received half of the couple's 
property in divorce proceedings two dozen years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wanted to go through that same thing again. I just felt, 'I'm going 
to treat the lady like a goddess, but I'm never going to divide my property 
again.' It's like, if you're building a castle and almost get to the top and 
someone comes and cuts it in half, and then cuts it in half again," Maglica 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 63 years old. I can't start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Maglica said he is surprised that it went this far.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had a trust in her and believed in her, and never thought it was possible 
for anything like this to happen. I had no intention to ever mislead her or put 
her out on the street," he said. "Honestly, I believed it could be settled and 
we could still be together." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking far more relaxed than he did during weeks of trial, Maglica took a 
visitor on a tour of the company that made him a millionaire, explaining with a 
feverish detail each automated assembly system and cleverly designed machine, 
and proudly showing off the lasers that inscribe the head of each Mag-Lite 
flashlight with a trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could have the jury come over here and go through the plant and see 
what it really takes to do this," Maglica said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were that easy, everybody would be doing it," he said, shaking his head 
at the jury that could have believed Claire's work at Mag was equal to his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica headed the personnel department and was in charge of marketing 
and purchasing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anthony Maglica on Friday derided her contributions, pointing out cases of 
orange pumpkin flashlight heads that Claire had thought up as a Halloween 
gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sound conceited, forgive me, but it really takes a vision," he said of the 
work, peering intently at a graphic rendition of a magnified flashlight switch 
on an employee's computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Maglica stopped Friday to share a mango with a worker and chatted with a tool 
grinder who dresses up yearly as the company Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 But any mention of the love he feels for his grown children from a first 
marriage, his mission to repair the sight of 13-year-old Sead Bekric, or his 
memories of his own mother, whose tiny framed portrait decorates his desk, and 
his eyes filled with tears. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Claire, he added, who framed the small picture for him and took it out 
of a drawer where Anthony had refused to look at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to thank Claire for one thing she did for me," Maglica said. "She 
helped me get over my mother's death."

STUDENTS SEEK TO CURB SPEECH THAT'S OFFENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 When Huntington Beach High School students Brandy Marks, Joshua Holland and 
their friends saw racist flyers on campus, they were irate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like, 'I'm not wanted here,' " said Marks, 18, one of about 25 black 
students at the school. "It made me really angry." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the students went to school Principal Jim Staunton to demand action, 
he could only point to a section in the state education code that bars acts 
"disruptive to the school environment" but does not address racist acts on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 So Staunton, Marks, Holland and several friends appealed to Assemblywoman 
Doris Allen (R-Cypress) for legislation meant to give school administrators the 
power to punish students who say or write statements to others with the intent 
to incite a disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't go through (school) principals with this problem now because 
they'll always come back with the line, 'We don't have the authority,' " said 
Marks, who will be a freshman at Cal State Long Beach in the fall. "We figured 
we would go all the way to the top" to change that.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Marks and Holland will testify before the state Senate's 
education committee in Sacramento about the need for such a change in the 
education code.  
</P>
<P>
 Marks, Holland and their 17-year-old friend La'Tron Hutchins did not know the 
ins and outs of free speech and legislation when they started their campaign. 
But they learned quickly with the help of several teachers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Black pupils make up 1.5% of Huntington Beach High's 2,000 students, Staunton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get snide comments when you walk down the hall, you feel like you're 
different," said Marks, a former cheerleader at the school who graduated this 
month. "You don't feel comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 The threesome are unlikely friends, by their own admission. If they were 
students at a mostly black school, they said, Holland would probably hang out 
with the jocks, Hutchins with the rappers and musicians and Marks with the 
cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were united at Huntington Beach High by issues of race. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a student at the school was found with a racist flyer showing a 
caricature of a black man, and Staunton suspended him. When the youth's parents 
protested, Staunton said, he turned to the education code and found that it did 
not specifically spell out administrators' authority to punish students on the 
basis of offensive speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, it happened again. Several non-students were seen dropping 
racist flyers in the campus parking lot, Staunton said. 
</P>
<P>
 That set off the students' frustrations, said Holland, 17, during a recent 
interview in Staunton's office. They took their anger to Staunton and told him 
to do something to stop the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "People came right through these doors," Holland said, pointing to the 
administration entrance. "Mr. Staunton couldn't even sit down -- we took up 
every chair." 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchins nodded. "I said, 'Why does this keep happening?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Staunton said the students' demands made him feel "defensive." But he decided 
to invite the students to gather before school to discuss the incidents and 
possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 They got together and drafted a resolution against race-related crime, 
Staunton said. He told Allen about the resolution, and her staff fashioned it 
into a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "What impressed (Allen) the most was that these students who had been victims 
of verbal abuse had decided not to respond in kind but to go through the proper 
channels with an educated response," said Marc Burgat, Allen's chief 
legislative aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's legislation would amend the education code to include a section that 
allows administrators to suspend or expel any student who verbally or through 
writing tries to incite a "lawless action." 
</P>
<P>
 Codes regulating speech have become a hot issue on college campuses in recent 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 The universities of Michigan and Wisconsin adopted codes in the late 1980s 
barring racist and stigmatizing speech. Both were struck down by the U.S. 
Supreme Court after challenges that they violated the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 At UC Irvine, a speech policy was enacted about three years ago, said Horace 
Mitchell, vice chancellor for student affairs. Officials may talk to students 
about their actions or punish them if they use words attacking other 
individuals on the basis of sexual orientation, gender or other 
characteristics. No students have ever been disciplined, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tension is between freedom of speech, and the kind of speech that creates 
an intimidating and hostile environment," Mitchell said. "It's a very thin line 
-- or rope -- that you walk on between them." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State University law professor Charles Calleros, who helped create 
that university's anti-harassment policy, said he credits the Huntington Beach 
students for trying to change the law, but he added that it may be off-target. 
</P>
<P>
 "The event that inspired this action was dissemination of an idea that was 
offensive," Calleros said. "The danger is: You have a law like that which 
either won't have much effect on offensive speech because it only applies to 
extreme things that result in violence . . . or some (administrator) is going 
to take that law and apply it much more broadly than intended and discipline 
people for saying unpopular things." 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Lobaco, the American Civil Liberties Union legislative director in 
Sacramento, said he is concerned about the bill's language. "The bill fails to 
define what 'lawless' action is," he said. "It's too broad." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach High students, though, want to see their efforts result 
in change. The lawmaking process is "there to do something," said Holland, who 
will go to the University of Colorado at Boulder to study and play football in 
the fall. "You can't rely on other people to do things for you."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; SENIOR OF THE YEAR IS DRIVEN TO SERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The first time he volunteered to deliver meals to seniors here, Murad (Mike) 
Fenerjian got lost several times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some streets here are funny," said Fenerjian, 77. "They are cut off on one 
block and then continue on another block. You wouldn't find those back East." 
</P>
<P>
 But seven years and more than 6,200 hours of volunteer work later, the Boston 
native has mastered his meal-delivery route. He has delivered 750 meals to 
homes and has coordinated volunteers for a program that often serves as the 
only link to the outside world for the homebound elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 For his work, Fenerjian, a retired plant manager, was named the city's 1994 
Senior of the Year. The City Council honored him with a proclamation two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shocked me," said Fenerjian. "I wasn't looking for honors. I love doing 
this job. It brings a lot of pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Fenerjian had not done any volunteer work until he arrived in California eight 
years ago. Now, the effort has become a family affair. Fenerjian's 
brother-in-law, Leo Kalian, 68, was named Senior of the Year last year, also 
for his volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalian was married to Fenerjian's sister, Anna, who died 10 years ago. He is 
now married to Sylvia Kalian, assistant director of the Westminster Senior 
Center, who runs the Home Meals Delivery program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six years ago, I was so desperate for volunteers that I married one," Sylvia 
Kalian said with a laugh. "But I was lucky, because I got Mike, too. I got two 
for the price of one." 
</P>
<P>
 Fenerjian and Leo Kalian came to Southern California from Boston together in 
1986. They lived in the same house and began to volunteer for the home meals 
program in 1987. Soon thereafter, Leo Kalian met his future wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The home meals program, now in its 11th year, is funded by federal funds, 
donations and the proceeds of fund-raisers, Sylvia Kalian said.  
</P>
<P>
 Currently, volunteers deliver 65 meals a day to homebound seniors. The hot 
meals consist of meat, vegetables, fruits and milk and cold dinners of salad, 
cottage cheese, juice and desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Fenerjian's job is to recruit volunteers and coordinate the meal 
routes. He works an average of four hours a day, doing office work such as 
keeping the books, in addition to delivering meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such a good model" for seniors, said Betty Goyne, director of the senior 
center. "He's out helping people instead of sitting home watching television. 
He's a very caring person." 
</P>
<P>
 Goyne said Fenerjian is one of about 90 volunteers who help run programs at 
the senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senior of the Year award became an annual event in 1983 to honor 
volunteers, Goyne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenerjian, who loves to gamble in Las Vegas and bet on horse races, said he 
expects to volunteer for as long as he is healthy. Never married, he said that 
he feels he has an obligation to seniors who are often alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just want other people to know that they are still there," he said. BERT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SCHOOLS, CITY TO BUILD 2ND SKATEBOARD 
RINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction of the city's second public skateboard facility is scheduled to 
start in the next three weeks, with completion targeted for early October. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest skateboard rink will be at the entrance of the football stadium at 
Huntington Beach High School on Main Street, near Yorktown Avenue. The project 
is a partnership of the city and the Huntington Beach Union High School 
District. The school district is paying $70,000 of the $160,000 cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first skateboard facility was completed and opened more than a year ago 
at Murdy Park," said Ron Hagan, the city's director of community services. 
"That skateboard facility has proved to be tremendously popular, and despite 
all the predictions of problems, there hasn't been anything negative since it 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, vandalism once caused by (illegal) skateboarding around the curbs 
and picnic tables has dropped to zero since the facility opened. So we know 
these facilities work." 
</P>
<P>
 The city launched its program of building public skateboard rinks about two 
years ago, after cracking down on illegal skateboarding in front of businesses 
and at schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The new project calls for improving the high school stadium's entrance as well 
as providing a concrete rink for skateboarders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city sometimes uses the stadium for public events, so it's appropriate 
that this be an area that is fixed up," Hagan said. "That entrance area is 
pretty rundown. The project includes a new entrance (to the stadium) and a new 
ticket booth." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said construction of the new skateboard facility is expected to curtail 
illegal skateboarding that has for years caused damage to the Huntington Beach 
High campus and to the city's adjoining Worthy Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board Tuesday night approved its share of the costs. School 
officials said the $70,000 comes from district redevelopment funds and 
school-district fees charged to developers.BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; SCHOOL DISTRICT TO INCREASE CLASS SIZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With state funding going down, class sizes in the Cypress School District will 
be going up next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The elementary district's school board has approved a fiscal year budget that 
calls for increasing average class size from 26.5 students last year to 29 
students in the coming school year, Supt.William D. Eller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the third year the state has not provided a cost-of-living 
increase," Eller said. He added that the state's per pupil funding for Cypress 
School District will be less than the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress School District is having to make budget cuts despite growing 
enrollment. The district projects enrollment will increase from last year's 
4,250 students to about 4,350 students next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 budget unanimously approved by the school board Tuesday predicts 
about $17.8 million in income, an increase of about $100,000 over the previous 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eller said the slight growth in income does not cover the increased costs 
for employee benefits, school materials and other escalating expenses. The 
school district is giving teachers a 1% pay increase next year. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; VOTERS TO DECIDE ON COUNCIL TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City voters will decide in November if council members should be limited to 
serving two terms. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli and Councilman Jeffrey Thomas said they believe 
voters should be given the option of choosing between two-term or three-term 
limits for council members. 
</P>
<P>
 They said that the city will have less clout on county and regional boards 
that operate on a seniority basis if council members are limited to two terms. 
A full term lasts four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week voted 4 to 0 to approve a measure that will allow 
voters to decide on the two-term limit. Saltarelli and Thomas joined council 
members Jim Potts and Michael J. Doyle in voting for the measure. Councilwoman 
Tracy Worley was absent. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; 3 CHURCHES OBJECT TO FARMERS MARKET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal for a farmers market on Sundays brought objections from church 
leaders at a City Council meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Three churches urged council members to delay voting on the proposal because 
the market, which would close a block of North Orange Street to traffic from 8 
a.m. to 2 p.m. Sundays, would put a crunch on church members trying to park. 
Several church officials also said the "carnival atmosphere" of the market was 
not appropriate on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they were dismayed that the city and civic groups had not 
been better informed about the potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Magliato of the Son Light Christian Center said that the antique dealers 
are not the only ones who need to worry about Old Town patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our only time of business, shall we say, is on Sunday," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Magliato joined other church leaders in objecting to the "party atmosphere" 
that a farmers market would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 William Teachout, president of the board of trustees for the First 
Presbyterian Church, said he envisioned having to post guards outside the 
church parking lot every Sunday, something they do during the city's annual 
street fair. And, he added, "we would like to keep the Sabbath holy and not 
have it on a Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 The same church leaders said they do not object to the idea of a farmers 
market but do object to the time and place. Mary Jo Harper, assistant minister 
at the First United Methodist Church, noted that the market would be "a clean 
and upright family activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council delayed the decision until July 12, despite protests from 
merchants that valuable time would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Lorenzini, market manager for the Orange County Farm Bureau, told the 
council that the churches and the city were "missing the boat" by delaying the 
market. "I, too, am a Christian," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The market, she explained, would be run by the Orange County Farm Bureau and 
the county's Health Care Agency, which would certify farmers and take care of 
insurance, traffic diversion, set-up and cleanup.LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; BUSY INTERSECTION TO GET TRAFFIC SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers this week began installing a traffic signal at a busy intersection 
where two 78-year-old pedestrians were struck by a pickup truck and killed last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had planned to place the signal at West 19th Street and Meyer 
Place for more than a year and were accepting bids for the job when the 
accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The signal costs about $98,000 and is expected to be activated later this 
summer, said Peter Naghavi, the city's transportation manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy they are doing it. This will slow the cars down," said Madeleine 
Baebler, 87, a resident of the nearby Bethel Towers retirement center who 
witnessed the accident. "Quite a few (seniors) still go over that way. I 
promised my children I would not cross that way anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred B. Young and Patricia E. Crowell were walking back to their home at 
Bethel Towers after having breakfast at a fast-food restaurant when they were 
struck by the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 They were in a crosswalk, but the driver's view was obstructed by the sun and 
he apparently did not see them, police said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Naghavi said the signal will include pedestrian signs, left-turn arrows as 
well as a light that will direct traffic out of the restaurant's parking lot. 
The restaurant, a McDonald's, agreed to close one of its driveways to conform 
with the signal's traffic flow pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been a good neighbor on this," Naghavi said of the fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Baebler said that the accident remains a painful and personal memory to Bethel 
Towers residents. 
</P>
<P>
 She has not been out to the intersection for several months because of a leg 
problem. But Baebler said she plans to visit the area once the signal is 
working. 
</P>
<P>
 The same intersection was the site of another accident in October, 1990, when 
a 25-year-old woman was hit by a car and seriously injured. The victim filed a 
lawsuit against the city, which is still pending.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OFFICIALS WARN ABOUT FIREWORKS DANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire officials have issued their annual warning about the dangers of playing 
with fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fireworks, even those labeled "safe and sane," are outlawed in all but 
five cities in the county, according to the Orange County Fire Department.Yet 
each year, firefighters respond to numerous fires and injuries related to the 
hand-sized explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time of the year is very busy for us in terms of prevention," said Emmy 
Day, public information officer for the Fire Department. "We live in a desert . 
. . and there are an awful lot of wood shake shingle roofs (on houses) and dry 
vegetation that are highly dangerous when combined with fireworks." 
</P>
<P>
 From mid-June to mid-July last year, there were 71 fireworks-related accidents 
that caused $163,000 in damage, according to a 1993 Fire Department report. 
There were two minor injuries associated with fireworks and the Independence 
Day holiday, Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities that allow the sale of so-called safe fireworks are Costa Mesa, Garden 
Grove, Buena Park, Santa Ana and Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal fireworks can be identified by the state fire marshal's seal. Fireworks 
considered dangerous and illegal are snap caps, sky rockets, sparklers, cherry 
bombs, M-80s and some others. 
</P>
<P>
 For information on Fourth of July fireworks displays in the county, call (714) 
834-4532. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fire Department will also be monitoring its fireworks hot 
line, where people can call to report violators at (714) 538-3501. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; SEA COUNTRY CENTER GETS DEDICATED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sea Country Senior and Community Center, which has been on the city's 
"to-do" list since incorporation in 1989, will be dedicated today 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication, with speeches by city leaders and a traditional blessing by a 
Juaneno Indian, will take place at 10 a.m. The public is invited to tour the 
14,000-square-foot building at 24602 Aliso Creek Road until 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano Valley Symphony will provide background music, and square 
dancers and ballroom dancers will demonstrate their skills in the center's 
ballroom during the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise classes, sewing groups, and card-playing circles that have been 
meeting at the Senior Center on La Paz Road will now meet at the new Senior and 
Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility also has areas for shuffleboard and boccie ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The city spent about $3.3 million building the center, said Ken Montgomery, 
the city public works director. Another $275,000 will be needed annually to 
operate the center. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20% of that, Montgomery said, should be gathered from renting the 
building for private events such as wedding receptions and birthday parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most important capital improvement project the city has ever 
undertaken and probably ever will undertake," Montgomery said. "It's a big 
milestone in the city's history. We're excited about having the facility." LYNN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; LOW-INCOME HOUSING DECISION DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A decision on whether to allow a controversial apartment project for 
low-income tenants in the southwest end of town has been delayed by the City 
Council until July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members received a fax this week from the city of Buena Park, urging 
them to delay a vote on the 108-unit proposal while that city studies the 
potential effect of such housing on residents, whose homes border the proposed 
project site. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacant four acres where the apartment would be built is on the north side 
of Valencia Drive, west of Magnolia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 70 project opponents attended the two-hour hearing Tuesday night. About 
12 people who live next to the site complained that it would attract criminals, 
invade privacy, increase crime, overcrowd area schools and devalue their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the project's critics, however, conceded that the neighborhood is 
already in trouble and has been decaying for years. They said they fear 
affordable housing would only accelerate the decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so many problems, we really can't handle any more," resident Pete 
Blanchard said. He said about 100 of his neighbors signed a petition opposing 
the affordable housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we inflict upon ourselves these pockets of instant slums?" resident 
Vic Bangle added. 
</P>
<P>
 But the developers, KD Housing Partners and Kaufman & Broad Multi-Housing 
Group Inc., said the apartment complex would provide "decent affordable housing 
that is appropriate for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 "The project will add quality to the area," said Jay Kuhne, a project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael A. Costa, president of Kaufman & Broad, said the $12-million project 
would include the two- and three-story stucco apartment complex, a gated entry, 
underground utilities and decorative masonry walls along property lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the units would be restricted for families with low incomes. Rents would 
range from $402 to $900 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa said the project's critics are stereotyping the people who would move 
into the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that there's a misconception about this project," Costa said. "It's 
sad that this project has the connotation of being a project that would produce 
crime. . . . It isn't low-income projects that produce crime, it's lack of 
management that ends up creating deteriorating properties." 
</P>
<P>
 He said managers would live on the property and make sure the place is 
maintained and meets city requirements. The city would be able to monitor 
management at the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the council approve the project, the Redevelopment Agency would 
consider loaning the developers $1.6 million and the developers would have to 
keep 53 units affordable for up to 99 years, city officials said. MIMI KO

 Nesee Smith, office manager for Laguna Cares, a counseling service formed

facing stress.

 "People . . . are thinking, 'Gosh, by now, by summertime, I thought everything 
would be back to normal,' and it's not," Smith said. "The shock has worn off 
and now they're having to literally deal with the different agencies it takes 
to rebuild a house or restructure a business."

 To aid professional counselors who are working with the fire survivors, Laguna 
Cares needs volunteers to perform duties such as answering the telephones.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; RECALL GROUP ACCUSES CITY OF DELAYING VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fullerton Recalls Committee, a group that successfully campaigned for the 
ouster of Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and City Council members Molly McClanahan 
and Don Bankhead, has accused the city of delaying a special election to 
replace the three city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members said they want the special election to take place in 
October, before the Nov. 8 general election. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials, who announced earlier this month that the special election 
will be consolidated with the general election, said holding the elections 
together would save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the California election code, a special election must be held from 114 
to 129 days after the day the results are submitted to the City Council by the 
city clerk, Anne N. York. Earlier this month, 13,919 residents voted for a 
special election to replace the three city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 York has not formally submitted the results to the council. The registrar of 
voters completed certifying the June 7 election results June 14, but York did 
not submit the results to the council at Tuesday's council meeting, making the 
election in October impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. R.K. Fox said York will submit the results to the City Council at 
the July 5 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas S. Babcock, Recalls Committee chairman, said the city should have been 
notified of the results at this week's meeting so that the special election 
could be held in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election should have been certified immediately," Babcock said. "The city 
is purposely delaying the special election so Molly, Don and Buck can stay in 
office as long as possible. . . . The people of Fullerton said they wanted the 
three council members to be removed from office with a special election as soon 
as possible. I guess we were naive to think that the city would listen." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said those replacing McClanahan and Catlin would serve in 
office for about three weeks because their terms expire in November.  
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense," Fox said. "It will make no 
difference whether there are two elections or one." 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead's term does not expire until 1996. The winner in that election will 
serve until Bankhead's term ends. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; OFFICER SUES CHIEF, CITY OVER SUSPENSION 
</P>

<P>
 A veteran police officer has filed a lawsuit against the city, the chief of 
police and the city manager, contending he was wrongly disciplined for 
allegedly lying to a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Chano Camarillo, who has been with the Police Department for 27 years, filed 
the lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court on Wednesday. He was suspended by 
Police Chief David L. Snowden for 120 hours without pay in January for 
allegedly lying during an internal investigation about a 30-minute personal 
phone call he answered while on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 In his lawsuit, Camarillo admits taking the phone call but denies that he lied 
about it during the investigation. He also contends that his actions did not 
merit such a severe penalty, particularly in light of his 27 years of service 
and his good record, said Richard A. Levine, Camarillo's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're questioning the appropriateness of the penalty," Levine said. "There 
are a number of factors why this (penalty) was excessive." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine cited past cases in which Costa Mesa officers were given much lighter 
penalties, including one officer who was suspended for five days on a similar 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 However, according to a city report included in the lawsuit, another officer 
was fired and another demoted and suspended for lying to superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo is demanding back pay, attorney's fees and other costs incurred in 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal police investigation showed that Camarillo left his post Jan. 10 
to answer a 30-minute personal telephone call while other officers in his area 
were busy, according to the city report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also states that Camarillo lied to an investigator and a police 
sergeant about the call. Levine said the report does not contain any evidence 
to substantiate the charge against his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowden and attorneys for the city were unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, who plans to retire later this year, is on medical leave due to 
work-related injuries, said a spokesman for the Police Department. TAMMY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 34-year-old man driving on the Costa Mesa Freeway died early Friday morning 
after his Jeep tumbled over a 100-foot embankment and landed on Grand Avenue 
near Dyer Road, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Hector Orejel of Yorba Linda, was ejected from the vehicle and 
died at the scene, CHP spokeswoman Angel Johnson said.It was not known whether 
he had been wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Orejel was southbound in the No. 4 lane north of Dyer Road, Johnson said. "For 
whatever reason, the Jeep drifted to the right side of the roadway, hit a 
freeway sign, and rolled over the side." 
</P>
<P>
 Orejel was alone in the Jeep and no other cars were involved in the 1:30 a.m. 
accident.

 A 22-year-old man sitting in a parked car was shot to death Thursday night 
after exchanging words with two males who confronted him in the 3600 block of 
Hazard Avenue, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Hugo Garcia of Anaheim was shot several times in the upper and lower 
body with a handgun.He was pronounced dead on arrival at Garden Grove Hospital 
and Medical Center, said Sgt. Dick Faust. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was approached by two males in a light-colored vehicle, Faust said. 
"They got out of the car and confronted the victim. Words were exchanged and 
the victim was shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen were last seen driving away westbound on Hazard Avenue, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Robert Helton said the shooting appears to be gang-related. He said the 
victim, who is a former resident of Santa Ana, is a known gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is gang activity in the area where the shooting occurred," Helton said. 
"Although we have not had any shootings on Hazard Avenue that I can recall, we 
have had shootings in that general area." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear what the victim was doing on the street, police said.

THOMAS MANISCALCO, A LAWYER AND MOTORCYCLE GANG LEADER, IS CONTINUED.

 A judge Friday rejected a bid by convicted triple murderer Thomas F. 
Maniscalco for a new trial during the opening of a sentencing hearing in Orange 
County's longest-running criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary halted the hearing about 90 minutes 
into the sentencing proceeding to break for a lunch meeting and a busy 
afternoon court calendar. The judge postponed the rest of the sentencing 
hearing until Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco, a Westminster attorney who co-founded the Hessians motorcycle 
gang, was convicted in March -- exactly 10 years to the day after his arrest -- 
of three counts of second-degree murder.  
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in his second trial found that Maniscalco participated in the slayings 
of Richard (Rabbit) Rizzone, 36; Rizzone's bodyguard, Thomas Monahan, 28, and 
Rizzone's girlfriend, Rena Miley, 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution alleged that the 49-year-old attorney ordered the killings in 
1980 during a dispute over counterfeit money and drug profits skimmed from his 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Friday's hearing centered on Maniscalco's motion for a new trial, with 
the jury's verdict the focus of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyers said the second-degree murder convictions were "fatally flawed" 
given the prosecution's contention during the trial that Maniscalco 
masterminded what were described as execution-styled killings. First-degree 
murder, which the jury rejected in the case, typically involves premeditation 
on a killer's part, while second-degree murder is a less-organized type of 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge O'Leary said there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict, 
and rejected the defense's contention that mistakes were made during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco has always denied involvement in the killings, contending he was 
framed by an admitted gunman who stole drugs and money from the victims and 
then tried to implicate him in exchange for immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Each second-degree murder count carries a possible 16-year-to-life prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard King said Friday he will seek the maximum sentence 
for Maniscalco -- 48 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But Curt Livesay, one of Maniscalco's lawyers, said the maximum sentence would 
mean "life without parole" for his middle-aged client. He will ask instead that 
the judge allow Maniscalco to serve the three terms concurrently, making his 
sentence 16 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Livesay also made numerous requests during the hearing for changes in a 
pre-sentencing report prepared by the county Probation Department. Livesay said 
the report depicts Maniscalco as a scheming killer, which he said was not 
supported by the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Livesay said the report is critical because it could help officials determine 
when Maniscalco might be eligible for parole.

POLICE INVESTIGATING TEEN'S DEATH AS POSSIBLE HOMICIDE 
</P>

 Investigators have still not determined if a 17-year-old who died from a 
gunshot wound to the head shot himself while playing with a handgun or was shot 
by someone else, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Quy Tung Nguyen of Westminster was found Thursday afternoon inside 
an apartment in the 13700 block of Edwards Street by officers investigating 
reports of gunfire, Sgt. Mike Mittelstaedt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were people inside of the living room passing the gun around and 
playing with it," Mittelstaedt said. "The victim suffered a head wound and the 
gun was found underneath his body. But we have not proved that he did it to 
himself so we are handling it like a homicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the shooting, two young men were seen running out of the 
apartment, witnesses told police. They were later tracked down by investigators 
and are not considered suspects, the sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are witnesses, not suspects," Mittelstaedt said. "Apparently, each had 
their reasons for not wanting to be there after the shooting. One was on 
probation." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the victim nor the two who ran from the apartment lived there. The 
female occupant of the apartment was in the shower when the shooting occurred 
and called police after hearing a gunshot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to us to prove one way or another," Mittelstaedt said. "We haven't 
proven that it was a homicide. But it's looking more and more like the deceased 
did it to himself."

GARDEN GROVE SCHOOLS BUDGET MAKES NO CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The governing board of the Garden Grove Unified School District approved its 
1994-95 budget, a $178.9-million spending plan that maintains all current 
programs and staffing levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education unanimously approved the budget without comment during 
its regular meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they avoided having to make cuts in spite of 
inadequate state funding partly because they often left vacant positions open 
to save money and encouraged school administrators to reduce expenses whenever 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district is doing OK. We're holding our own," despite this being the 
fifth consecutive year with no increase in revenue from the state, said Art 
Becker, district business manager. Based on current projections of state 
funding, "we believe we can run the same program next year as this year," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is the second largest in the county, serving about 42,000 
students. The district covers most of Garden Grove and parts of Westminster, 
Cypress, Stanton, Santa Ana, Anaheim and Fountain Valley.JON NALICK

ORANGE MAN JAILED IN WOMAN'S FATAL STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Orange man was held Friday in connection with the fatal stabbing of a 
23-year-old woman who was found lying on a street in Stanton, the Sheriff's 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert William Fordham, 28, was arrested in Garden Grove late Thursday night, 
shortly after the victim, Kimberly Michele Mims, was discovered. She had been 
stabbed at least twice in the upper torso, said Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fordham and the victim appear to have been involved in an arrangement of 
solicitation for prostitution at the time of the homicide," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mims, who authorities said had been a transient for at least two years, had an 
arrest earlier this year for solicitation for prostitution in Los Angeles 
County, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies were called to the area of Lessue and Stanton avenues at 
11:55 p.m. to respond to a report of someone hit by a car. Deputies found Mims 
in the street. She was treated by paramedics, then taken to UCI Medical Center 
in Orange where she was pronounced dead, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told investigators that they had seen a light-colored Toyota with 
damage to the front end crash through an oleander hedge on the side of the 
street. The car was then seen speeding southbound on Stanton Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that there was some confusion initially on the part of witnesses 
who thought the car had hit the woman," Martini said.  
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, a Garden Grove police officer stopped a white 1980 Toyota 
Cressida on Chapman Avenue east of Brookhurst Street. The car was traveling 
with a flat left front tire and had damage to the front end, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had been no broadcast, so the officer had not made any connection to 
the Stanton incident," Martini said. "But he made the stop and observed that 
the suspect had blood on his clothing. He put out a broadcast and a link was 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said "further investigation and evidence" linked Fordman to Mims.  
</P>
<P>
 Fordham was arrested at the scene without incident. He is being held at Orange 
County Jail on suspicion of murder.

MARKET TURMOIL CLOUDS THE RECOVERY; AS DOLLAR FADES, SO DOES OPTIMISM; 
CALIFORNIA CASTS A WARY EYE AT FED AND HOPES FOR STABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The specter of additional interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve Board in 
response to this week's fall in the dollar's value has sent more chills through 
some Californians, who fear such a move could further endanger the state's 
nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there is no sign yet that the Fed will act to boost short-term rates, 
the fear is real that more increases could damage the state's housing industry, 
which experts look to as the locomotive pulling the state out of its four-year 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market seems to have absorbed the rise in mortgage rates to date, but 
another (percentage) point would put them up at close to 9.5% or 10% . . . and 
it would seem likely that that would cut into sales and new construction," said 
Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California 
Economy in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising mortgage rates in the spring -- sparked by the Fed's earlier rate 
increases, which were designed to head off inflation -- contributed to a 4.5% 
month-to-month decline in home sales in May, though sales were 20% above 
year-ago levels, the California Assn. of Realtors reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the UCLA Business Forecasting Project on Wednesday reported that the 
state's economic growth in 1994 would be weak, in part because rising interest 
rates were adversely affecting the housing market. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Moyer, who owns Century 21 real estate brokerages in Orange and Yorba 
Linda, said the initial rise in interest rates late last year was good for 
business, scaring people into the home-buying market and causing a surge from 
December to March. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then they creeped a little too high, and there was a slowdown, but not to the 
depths of last year," he said. But he worries about a further hike. A one-point 
increase "would be disastrous," he said. "It reduces significantly the number 
of qualified buyers available." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is pessimistic, however.  
</P>
<P>
 David Hensley, former head of UCLA's Business Forecasting Project and now 
regional economist with Salomon Bros. in New York, argues that housing in 
California would remain very affordable by historical standards even if 
long-term rates went as high as 10% -- which he thinks is unlikely. (Consumers 
also tend to turn to adjustable-rate mortgages as fixed-rate mortgages climb.) 
</P>
<P>
 He predicts that the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, a key indicator of 
long-term rates, will remain below 8%. On Friday, bond values fell, sending 
yields up to 7.52% from 7.40% the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the housing market in California can withstand higher rates," Hensley 
said. Even an increase in mortgage rates to 9.5% or 10% from their current 8% 
or 8.5% "would not be catastrophic, though it would be cause for concern," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Fed and other central banks moved to buy up dollars on global 
currency markets to prop up the greenback, whose value has fallen dramatically 
in recent days, causing turmoil in stock and bond markets.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fed is not expected to make any decision on short-term interest rates 
until the July 5 meeting of its Open Market Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to historical patterns, the state's current recovery does not yet 
include a robust increase in new home construction, said Pauline Sweezey, chief 
economist with the state Department of Finance in Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
 "And we are, of course, concerned that any significant rise in long-term 
interest rates will stunt any incipient housing recovery," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Fed makes it clear it is raising rates because of international 
exchange rate concerns and not to head off inflation, it would raise 
expectations that rates could fall again soon, thereby mitigating the effects 
of such a hike, Levy said. Rising Rates 
</P>
<P>
 Recent rises in bond yields have forced up mortgage rates, hurting the 
California housing market. Thirty-year Treasury bond yields since May 24; daily 
closes:

 Friday: 7.52%
